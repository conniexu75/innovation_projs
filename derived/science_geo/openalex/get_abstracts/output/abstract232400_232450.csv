https://openalex.org/W2015849111,"Heritable variation in complex traits is generally considered to be conferred by common DNA sequence polymorphisms. We tested whether rare DNA sequence variants collectively contribute to variation in plasma levels of highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). We sequenced three candidate genes ( ABCA1, APOA1 , and LCAT ) that cause Mendelian forms of low HDL-C levels in individuals from a population-based study. Nonsynonymous sequence variants were significantly more common (16% versus 2%) in individuals with low HDL-C (&lt;fifth percentile) than in those with high HDL-C (&gt;95th percentile). Similar findings were obtained in an independent population, and biochemical studies indicated that most sequence variants in the low HDL-C group were functionally important. Thus, rare alleles with major phenotypic effects contribute significantly to low plasma HDL-C levels in the general population."

We report a 2.3-Mb de novo overlapping microdeletion on chromosome 8q12 identified by array comparative genomic hybridization in two individuals with CHARGE syndrome. Sequence analysis of genes located in this region detected mutations in the gene CHD7 in 10 of 17 individuals with CHARGE syndrome without microdeletions, accounting for the disease in most affected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1987845572,"Vesicle fusion involves vesicle tethering, docking, and membrane merger. We show that mitofusin, an integral mitochondrial membrane protein, is required on adjacent mitochondria to mediate fusion, which indicates that mitofusin complexes act in trans (that is, between adjacent mitochondria). A heptad repeat region (HR2) mediates mitofusin oligomerization by assembling a dimeric, antiparallel coiled coil. The transmembrane segments are located at opposite ends of the 95 angstrom coiled coil and provide a mechanism for organelle tethering. Consistent with this proposal, truncated mitofusin, in an HR2-dependent manner, causes mitochondria to become apposed with a uniform gap. Our results suggest that HR2 functions as a mitochondrial tether before fusion."

Plants also exhibit PCD, for example as a response to pathogens, although a plant caspase remains elusive. Here we show that vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE) is a protease essential for a virus-induced hypersensitive response that involves PCD. VPE deficiency prevented virus-induced hypersensitive cell death in tobacco plants. VPE is structurally unrelated to caspases, although VPE has a caspase-1 activity. Thus, plants have evolved a regulated cellular suicide strategy that, unlike PCD of animals, is mediated by VPE and the cellular vacuole."

The complex explains both the broad-based epothilone structure-activity relationship and the known mutational resistance profile. Comparison with Taxol shows that the longstanding expectation of a common pharmacophore is not met, because each ligand exploits the tubulin-binding pocket in a unique and independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1965206733,"Plexins are cell surface receptors for semaphorin molecules, and their interaction governs cell adhesion and migration in a variety of tissues. We report that the Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) receptor Plexin-B1 directly stimulates the intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of R-Ras, a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins that has been implicated in promoting cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth. This activity required the interaction of Plexin-B1 with Rnd1, a small GTP-binding protein of the Rho family. Down-regulation of R-Ras activity by the Plexin-B1-Rnd1 complex was essential for the Sema4D-induced growth cone collapse in hippocampal neurons. Thus, Plexin-B1 mediates Sema4D-induced repulsive axon guidance signaling by acting as a GTPase activating protein for R-Ras."
https://openalex.org/W1985207173,"We present a fluorescence-based, multiplex in situ hybridization method that permits the simultaneous detection of five differently labeled antisense RNA probes and up to seven differ-ent transcripts in a single Drosophila embryo. We also show that it should be possible to increase the number of detected transcripts substantially with nascent transcript multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization. These multiplex methods fill a current technological gap between high-resolution in situ hybridization with one or two fluorescently labeled probes and low-resolution but genome-wide microarray RNA profiling and should be of great utility in establishing gene networks."
https://openalex.org/W2101668682,"The alpha particle x-ray spectrometer on the Spirit rover determined major and minor elements of soils and rocks in Gusev crater in order to unravel the crustal evolution of planet Mars. The composition of soils is similar to those at previous landing sites, as a result of global mixing and distribution by dust storms. Rocks (fresh surfaces exposed by the rock abrasion tool) resemble volcanic rocks of primitive basaltic composition with low intrinsic potassium contents. High abundance of bromine (up to 170 parts per million) in rocks may indicate the alteration of surfaces formed during a past period of aqueous activity in Gusev crater."

We describe here human tribbles homologues (Htrbs) that control MAPK activity. MAPK kinases interact with Trbs and regulate their steady state levels. Further, Trbs selectively regulate the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, and p38 MAPK with different relative levels of activity for the three classes of MAPK observed depending on the level of Trb expression. These results suggest that Trbs control both the extent and the specificity of MAPK kinase activation of MAPK.

The central element in each MAPK pathway is a module of three protein kinases, MAPKK kinase, MAPKK, and MAPK (1Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). The three sets of effector MAPK differ in type of activating stimulus: JNKs and p38/HOG-1 primarily respond to stress (e.g. heat shock), and ERKs primarily respond to mitogens. However, a stimulus can activate more than one class of MAPK; the contribution of each pathway is cell type-dependent, and MAPK pathways can both synergize and antagonize. This is caused in part by regulatory proteins influencing signaling by a range of mechanisms including scaffolding (e.g. JIP-1, STE5), regulating localization (e.g. Ksr), or recruitment to targets (e.g. 14-3-3 proteins) (2Robinson M.J.

Downward. pAP-1 luc, pNFκB luc, pFR luc, pFA-CHOP, pFA2-Elk-1, pMEKK-1 pMEK-1, and pMEK-3 were part of the PathDetect system (Stratagene). Quantitative real time-PCR was performed to characterize the expression profile of human tribbles genes by using the Human Rapid-Scan panel (Origene). MRNA levels are expressed as relative units normalized for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. Cell Cultures and Transfections—HeLa (ECACC, 85060701) and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Raw cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Cells (1.5 × 104 per well) were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates 24 h prior to transfection. Transfections were performed using SuperFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's advice; each well received 500 ng of inducible reporter construct (pIL-8 luc, pAP-1 luc, pNFκB luc, or pLHRE-TK luc), 100 ng of pTK-RLuc (Promega) for normalization of transfection efficiency, and 50 ng of htrb-1 or htrb-3 expression vectors under investigation unless stated otherwise in the appropriate figure legend. 500 ng of pFR luc, 100 ng of pTK-RLuc, and 10 ng of pFA-CHOP or pFA2-Elk-1, 25 ng pMEK-1, or pMEK-3 plasmids were transfected to specifically activate p38 or ERK and to study the effect of htrb-3 on the activation. Sufficient pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) (“empty vector”) was added to keep the total DNA dose constant at 700 ng/well. 2 h after transfection, cells were washed, and 100 μl of fresh medium was added. Triplicate wells were transfected for each treatment. Stimulations were performed for 4 h (unless indicated otherwise) 24 h later. 2 nm IL-1β or 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor α, 0.5 μg/ml human growth hormone, 50 ng/ml PMA, or 10 nm of the other cytokines listed on Supplementary Table I was used (unless stated otherwise on the figure). Agonists were prepared and added as 10× stocks in 11 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Reporter levels were measured following 4 h of stimulation using the dual-luciferase system (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cytokines—IL-β was a kind gift from the Immunex Corporation. The other human cytokine preparations were kindly provided by Dr. Steve Poole, National Institute for Biological Standards Control. Western Blotting—For detection of pJun, pERK, and pMKK4, polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined, and an equal amount of total protein was loaded in each lane. Kinase assays were performed by using the appropriate kits from New England Biolabs. Human tribbles Identification and Sequence—Using a transcription expression screen for gene products mediating inflammatory cytokine signaling (19Kiss-Toth E. Dower S.K. Sayers J.R. Anal.

Genomics. 2002; 3: 131-137Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar), we identified a human tribbles homologue (htrb-1) which regulated the human IL-8 promoter in HeLa cells. The library clone encoded a portion of the 3′-untranslated region extending to the poly(A) tail (the library was oligo(dT)-primed) transcribed in the expression vector (pCDM8) in the sense orientation. PCR experiments using coding region primers to detect endogenous trb-1 message but not the truncated noncoding library-derived transcript showed that transfection of the library clone into HeLa cells caused a >10-fold increase in the level of endogenous trb-1 message, which correlated with inhibition of IL-8 promoter activity. 2E. Kiss-Toth, D. H. Wyllie, V. Jozsa, K. M. Oxley, T. Polgar, E. E. Qwarnstrom, and S. K. Dower, submitted for publication. Two other human tribbles homologues, htrb-2 and htrb-3 (41 and 51% identical to Htrb-1, respectively), were identified by data base searching; sequences have been submitted to GenBank™ (accession numbers AF250310 and AF250311). A family comprised of three trbs is found in mammals, and orthologs have been identified in both vertebrates and invertebrates. 3E. Kiss-Toth and S. K. Dower, unpublished data. All three Trb proteins share a central Trb domain. In addition, each has N-terminal (70–100 residues) and C-terminal (∼25 residues) domains, which are neither closely related to any other sequences nor closely related to each other. The Trb domain is homologous to protein serine-threonine kinases but lacks the active site lysine and is predicted to be kinase dead as shown for canine Trb-2 and Tribbles (5Grosshans J. Wieschaus E. Cell. 2000; 101: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 9Wilkin F. Suarez-Huerta N. Robaye B. Peetermans J. Libert F. Dumont J.E. Maenhaut C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Quantitative real time-PCR experiments showed that trb-1 mRNA was expressed in most human tissues with the highest levels in skeletal muscle, thyroid gland, pancreas, peripheral blood leukocytes, and bone marrow (Supplementary Fig. 1). trb-2 levels were highest in peripheral blood leukocytes, and trb-3 levels were highest in pancreas peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow; in addition HeLa cells were found to express trbs 1–3. (Supplementary Fig. 1). Trbs Regulate AP-1—When overexpressed, Htrb-1 repressed basal activity of the NFκB and AP-1-regulated IL-8 promoter in HeLa cells in culture but not its activation by IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor α (Fig. 1A). The NFκB sites mediate cytokine activation, whereas the AP-1 sites control basal activity (22Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Our results therefore suggest that Trb-1 acts selectively on pathways leading to AP-1. Consistent with this, testing specific NFκB or AP-1 reporters activated by MEKK-1 co-transfection showed that Htrb-1 inhibited AP-1 activity but not NFκB (Fig. 1, B and C) nor a signal transducers and activators of transcription-responsive LHRE promoter (Fig. 1D). Specificity was also analyzed by testing a panel of human cytokines in the presence or absence of Htrb-3; AP-1 activation was inhibited (Fig. 1H), whereas NFκB activation was not (Supplementary Table I). Thus, whether activated by overexpression of upstream components or by physiological agonists, pathways leading to AP-1 activation were specifically inhibited by Trb overexpression. We have shown above that up-regulation of endogenous Trb-1 and ectopic overexpression of Trb-1 and Trb-3 inhibited AP-1 activity in HeLa cells. Next we examined the effects of suppressing endogenous Trb expression. An antisense construct encoding the htrb-3 5′-untranslated region and N-terminal domain was co-transfected with AP-1 or NFκB reporters using either MEKK-1 or NFκB inducing kinase as activators (Fig. 1, E–F). Trb-3 mRNA expression detected by quantitative real time-PCR using primers spanning the central Trb domain was reduced by >70% (Fig. 1G), whereas Trb-1 levels were only slightly altered by transfecting a high dose of AS-Trb-3 construct, suggesting a Trb-3-specific action. As observed with overexpression, AP-1 but not NF-κB activity was inhibited (Fig. 1, E and F). Trbs Regulate ERKs—Because Trbs are mitogen-induced and regulate String/cdc25, we examined the effect of Trb levels on the control of the Ras/MEK/ERK module. V12Ras-driven AP-1 activation was blocked by overexpression of both Trb-1 and Trb-3 (Fig. 2A). Also, HeLa cells were stimulated with PMA, and phospho-ERK levels were determined by Western blotting; basal levels were increased by Htrb-3, and both the extent and rate of phosphorylation were enhanced by Htrb-1 or Htrb-3 (Fig. 2B), correlating with enhanced ERK activity measured in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2D). Although expression levels of Trb-1 and Trb-3 were comparable (see Fig. 4), ERK activation was enhanced only using low doses of Trb-3 (Fig. 2C), and ERK potentiation was enhanced in the presence of all doses of Trb-1 within the range tested (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the system is more sensitive toward Trb-3 levels. Comparison between constitutive (transfection, Fig. 2A) and transient (PMA treatment, Fig. 2, B–D) stimuli showed that Trbs are capable of either upor down-regulating MAPK activity.Fig. 4Trbs interact with MAPKK specifically.A, titration of Myc-htrb and FLAG-MAPKK protein levels after co-transfection.

Lanes 2 and 4 are the experimental lanes for interactions between the Myc-tagged and FLAG-tagged proteins. Arrows indicate Htrb-3 (lane 2) or MEK-1 and MKK7 (lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MAPKK Interacts with Trbs—Overexpression of htrb-1 inhibited MEKK-1 mediated AP-1 but not NFκB activity (Fig. 1, B and C); a similar effect was seen when an AP-1 reporter was stimulated by PMA (Fig. 3A). To characterize the possible site of Htrb action, we tested whether increasing the dose of PMA (Fig. 3A) or MEKK-1 (Fig. 3B) could override the effect of Htrb-3. This was not the case, suggesting that htrb-3 controls a rate-limiting step downstream of MEKK-1. MEKK-1 phosphorylates MKK7 and/or MKK4, and activation of these kinases leads (via JNKs) to phosphorylation of transcription factors including c-Jun and CREB2. Western blotting showed that both the kinetics and the extent (as judged by gel mobility) of PMA-induced jun phosphorylation were altered by Trb-3 (Fig. 3C). Thus the locus of action of trbs in the JNK pathway is at or downstream of MAPKKs and at or upstream of c-jun. p38 MAPK was not activated by PMA in this system. However, overexpression of Trb proteins inhibited basal p38 activity as detected in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that Trbs act at the level of MAPKK/MAPK and hence control MAPK phosphorylation/activity. To identify the molecular target(s) of Trbs, we used transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments with Myc-tagged Trbs and FLAG-tagged MAPKs, MAPKKs, and MAPKK kinases. We found that MEK-1 interacts with both Trb-1 and Trb-3, MKK7 specifically interacts with Trb-3, and MKK4 specifically interacts with Trb-1 (Fig. 4B); however, no interactions were detected between Trb and MEKK-1, MLK-3, ERK-2, JNK-1, or p38 (data not shown). These findings were confirmed in yeast 2 hybrid assays; interactions were detected between both Trbs and MEK-1, between Trb-3 and MKK7, but not between Trb and JNK (data not shown). These data are consistent with the results of the functional assays (Figs. 2 and 3), suggesting that trbs control MAPK activation by binding to MAPKKs (Fig. 5C). Dose responses for all Trb/MAPKK combinations (Fig. 4A) showed that Htrb-3 levels were increased by MKK7 co-transfection (Fig. 4A, fourth row) and MEK-1 (second row) but not MKK4 (third row), which does not bind to Trb-3. Htrb-1 levels were enhanced by MKK4 (fifth row) but not MKK7 (sixth row), which does not bind to trb-1; thus Trb-MAPKK interactions stabilize Trbs. In contrast, no effect was seen on MAPKK levels, as illustrated by Fig. 4A (first row). These findings are consistent with the functional, immunoprecipitation, and yeast 2 hybrid data, and suggest that Trb protein levels may be regulated by MAPKK. Trbs Regulate the Relative Activation of MAPK—Because Trbs interact with more than one MAPKK and appear to have differential effects on ERK, JNK, and p38 (Figs. 2B and 3, C and D) activation, we examined whether Trbs differentially regulate MAPK activation. Because Htrb-3 interacts with both MEK-1 and MKK7, and MKK7 activates JNK in HeLa cells, we examined Htrb-3 using MAPK pathway-specific reporter assays to distinguish between ERK, JNK, and p38. At low doses, Htrb-3 enhanced JNK and ERK activation (with a more pronounced effect on ERKs) but inhibited p38 (Fig. 5A). At higher doses the activation of all three pathways was inhibited relative to control. Thus there appears to be a different optimal set point for each pathway (Fig. 5A), suggesting that Htrbs may regulate relative activation of the three classes of MAPK. We show that Trbs appear necessary for MAP kinase pathway function and are inhibitory at high levels. Several mechanisms can account for these findings. For example, Trbs might be scaffolds, both over- and underexpression of which has been shown to inhibit MAPK signaling (23Cacace A.M. Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Mathes K. Copeland T. Rubin G.M.

Further, Trb proteins have been reported to be rapidly mitogen induced and to have short half-lives (9Wilkin F. Suarez-Huerta N. Robaye B. Peetermans J. Libert F. Dumont J.E. Maenhaut C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Wilkin F. Savonet V. Radulescu A. Petermans J. Dumont J.E. Maenhaut C. J. Biol.

In addition, MAPK cascades have been suggested to incorporate a positive feedback loop leading to nonlinear behavior (24Ferrell J.E. Science's STKE. 2000; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/fill/OC_sigtrans;2000/52/pe1)PubMed Google Scholar). Modeling using ordinary differential equations shows that with these elements in place, Trb proteins could act either as activators or as inhibitors of MAPK activity, depending on the ratio of Trb to MAPKK levels in the cell. 4S. K. Dower and E. Kiss-Toth, unpublished data. Similar observations have been made by us and others for the NFκB (27Carlotti F. Chapman R. Dower S.K. Qwarnstrom E.E. J. Biol.

S. A. 2000; 97: 7865-7870Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We also note that these systems are capable of producing much more complex behaviors than the simple nonmonotonic dose responses we report here, for example the oscillations observed in cells from IκB knock-out mice and reproduced in simple mathematical models (28Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Although the inhibition at higher levels might be argued to be an artifact of Trb overexpression, Trb-3 has been shown to be an Akt inhibitor, UAS-driven Trb overexpression causes G2 mitotic arrest in imaginal disk cells, and the original trb clone we detected in our screen was active by virtue of its capacity to modulate endogenous Trb expression. Fly tribbles regulates cell cycle progression, blocking String action by promoting its degradation. Thus trb(–) flies show defective gastrulation because of elevated zygotic String activity driving premature mitosis (5Grosshans J. Wieschaus E.

There are apparent discrepancies between our results and those reported for Drosophila tribbles. First we observed no effect on cell cycle progression in HeLa cells caused by either overexpression or repression (with antisense) of either Trb-1 or Trb-3.3 This may be because HeLa cells express all three Trbs, and the two tested here are partially functionally redundant. We also found that both overexpression and repression of expression of Trbs inhibited AP-1 activity and that whereas Trb-3 overexpression inhibited the activity of all three MAPK cascades relative to control, at intermediate levels a modest enhancement of JNK and ERK activity was observed. However, overexpression of String and/or tribbles in Drosophila appears to have opposite effects on mitosis in cystocytes during oogenesis and in the ventral region during embryogenesis, an effect suggested to be caused by changes in the duration of G2 resulting from perturbations in the relative levels of String and Trb (8Mata J. Curado S. Ephrussi A. Rorth P. Cell. 2000; 101: 511-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Further, it has been reported that tribbles action in Drosophila is cell type-specific (7Seher T.C. Leptin M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 623-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We speculate that this may well apply for the mammalian homologues as well. In line with this model, we have found that MEKK1-mediated AP-1 activation is blocked by various tribbles in a cell type-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). A recent report shows that Trb-3 interacts with Akt and that elevated Trb levels block Akt activation in the liver (12Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Our current understanding of Akt signaling cascades places this protein kinase at the level of MAPKKs in the “signaling hierarchy” (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the observations of Du et al. (12Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) are consistent with a broader picture of Trb function as regulators of intermediate steps in these protein kinase cascades. In conclusion, the data in this report suggest that mammalian Trbs bind to and regulate MAPKK and may thus control the relative activation of MAPK by incoming signals. We thank P. Holland, R.

Two sextets resulting from nonstoichiometric magnetite are also present, except for a coating on the rock Mazatzal, where a hematite-like sextet is present. Greater proportions of ferric-bearing phases are associated with undisturbed soils and rock surfaces as compared to fresh rock surfaces exposed by grinding. The ubiquitous presence of olivine in soil suggests that physical rather than chemical weathering processes currently dominate at Gusev crater."
https://openalex.org/W2004264351,"A wide variety of chemically diverse compounds taste sweet, including natural sugars such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, and sugar alcohols, small molecule artificial sweeteners such as saccharin and acesulfame K, and proteins such as monellin and thaumatin. Brazzein, like monellin and thaumatin, is a naturally occurring plant protein that humans, apes, and Old World monkeys perceive as tasting sweet but that is not perceived as sweet by other species including New World monkeys, mouse, and rat. It has been shown that heterologous expression of T1R2 plus T1R3 together yields a receptor responsive to many of the above-mentioned sweet tasting ligands. We have determined that the molecular basis for species-specific sensitivity to brazzein sweetness depends on a site within the cysteine-rich region of human T1R3. Other mutations in this region of T1R3 affected receptor activity toward monellin, and in some cases, overall efficacy to multiple sweet compounds, implicating this region as a previously unrecognized important determinant of sweet receptor function.

Obesity and diabetes have reached epidemic proportions in developed societies. Although in part this is because of a more sedentary lifestyle, our strong preference for sweet tasting foods and their abundance is a major factor. Replacing sugar with low- or non-caloric sweeteners may be of benefit. To design more effective sweeteners it is important to understand at the molecular level how the sweet taste receptor functions. It has been demonstrated that the combination of T1R2 + T1R3 recognizes and responds to many sweet ligands, including sugars, small molecule artificial sweeteners, and protein sweeteners (1Li X.

Other members of this subclass are metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), 1The abbreviations used are: mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; ATD, amino-terminal domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein. calcium-sensing receptors, pheromone receptors, and other taste/olfactory receptors (T1R1, 5.24 odor receptor) (8Pin J.P. Galvez T. Prezeau L. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 325-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Each member of this family has a large extracellular amino-terminal domain (ATD) followed by a cysteine-rich linker domain and a seven-transmembrane-spanning helical region. The solved crystal structures of the ATD of homodimeric metabotropic glutamate type 1 receptor (mGluR1) show that the mGluR1 ligand-binding region consists of two amino-terminal protomers (9Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Each protomer comprises LB1 and LB2 domains that form a clamshell-like structure with the ligand-binding domain lying between LB1 and LB2. The free-form I (open-open_R) is thought to be in the resting state, whereas the free-form II (closed-open_A) is thought to be the active state. Agonist binding stabilizes the active closed-open_A conformer and promotes a shift of equilibrium toward the active state. The role of the cysteine-rich region, which links the ATD to the transmembrane domain, is presently unknown. Based on sequence homology and predicted secondary structural similarity to mGluR1, it seems likely that the T1R2 + T1R3 sweet receptor will also have open-open and open-closed forms and that small sweet compounds may stabilize the active form of T1R2 + T1R3 by binding within the cleft. However, unlike the mGluRs, the sweet receptor is heterodimeric with each monomer potentially playing a distinct role. The T1R2 protomer is the ligand-specifying component for many agonists (10Zhao G.Q. Zhang Y. Hoon M.A. Chandrashekar J. Erlenbach I. Ryba N.J. Zuker C.S.

Margolskee R.F. Science. 2003; 301: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), its physical role in taste signal detection/transmission is unknown. Six sweet tasting proteins, ranging in size from 6 to ∼22 kDa, have been discovered (13Faus I. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 53: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The mass of these protein sweeteners makes them too large to fit within the presumptive small molecule-binding pocket, suggesting that they stabilize the active conformation of the sweet receptor in a different manner. Identifying the binding sites for protein sweeteners might provide insights into the molecular events leading to receptor activation. Monellin and brazzein are intensely sweet proteins the structures of which have been solved (14Caldwell J.E. Abildgaard F. Dzakula Z. Ming D. Hellekant G. Markey J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Somoza J.R. Jiang F. Tong L. Kang C.H. Cho J.M. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 390-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); these two proteins are not structurally similar or similar to any of the other sweet proteins. We used the fact that the protein sweeteners (and also aspartame) are only perceived as sweet by Old World primates (16Hellekant G. Ninomiya Y. Danilova V. Physiol. Behav. 1997; 61: 829-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Danilova V. Hellekant G. Tinti J.M. Nofre C. J.

Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to identify a region of the human sweet receptor that is necessary for it to respond to brazzein. Heterologously expressed human T1R2 (hT1R2) + human T1R3 (hT1R3) responds to monellin and thaumatin, but mouse T1R2 (mT1R2) + mouse T1R3 (mT1R3) does not (1Li X. Staszewski L. Xu H. Durick K. Zoller M. Adler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4692-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 2Nelson G. Hoon M.A. Chandrashekar J. Zhang Y. Ryba N.J. Zuker C.S. Cell. 2001; 106: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Using mixed pairs of human and mouse T1Rs and mouse/human chimeric receptors we have determined that the residues required for a human-like response to monellin lie within the ATD of T1R2. hT1R2 + hT1R3 responds to brazzein, but hT1R2 + mT1R3 does not, indicating that residues in hT1R3 are required for receptor activity toward brazzein. We have located these human-specific residues within a small area in the cysteine-rich region of T1R3 (amino acids 536–545); this is the first case in which the cysteine-rich region of a G-protein-coupled receptor has been implicated in receptor function. Replacement of the cysteine-rich region of mouse T1R3 with the corresponding human segment allows hT1R2 + humanized mT1R3 to respond to brazzein. This same segment of T1R3 influences receptor activity toward monellin as well. Preparation of Chimeras and Point Mutations—Human T1R expression constructs were generated in the pEAK12 vector (Edge Biosystems) by genomic DNA-based methods. To subclone each gene into pEAK12 vector, an EcoRI Kozak cassette was introduced at the 5′ end before the start codon, and a NotI site was introduced at the 3′ end after the stop codon. Mouse T1R2 and T1R3 were cloned as reported (1Li X. Staszewski L. Xu H. Durick K. Zoller M. Adler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4692-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 4Max M. Shanker Y.G. Huang L. Rong M. Liu Z. Campagne F. Weinstein H. Damak S. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Gαl6 chimeras were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with mutagenic primers and cloned into pCDNA3. The five-residue carboxyl-terminal tail of Gαl6 was replaced by its counterpart from Gαgust(DCGLF) or Gαi3(ECGLY). Construction of human/mouse chimeras of T1Rs was performed by PCR using overlapping primers (19Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 77: 61-68Crossref Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). The integrity of all DNA constructs was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Point mutations in genes were made using the same overlapping PCR strategy. To construct pRluc-hT1R2 and pGFP-hT1R3, hT1R2 and hT1R3 were amplified by PCR using primers that removed the stop codons and introduced a novel NruI restriction site. The restriction fragments containing the hT1R2 or hT1R3 coding portions were inserted into the GFP- or Rluc-BRET plasmids between the EcoRI and EcoRV sites. This placed either GFP or Rluc at the COOH terminus of the designated T1R sequence. To construct GFP-tagged hT1R3 mutants, hT1R3 mutant plasmids were digested with EcoRI and KpnI then inserted into the hT1R3-GFP plasmids between the EcoRI and KpnI sites. This placed GFP at the COOH terminus of the designated mutant hT1R3 sequence. Functional Expression—HEK293 EBNA (HEK293E) cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For calcium imaging experiments, cells were seeded onto 6-well plates, and plasmid DNAs were transiently cotransfected into HEK293E cells using Mirus TransIT-293 (Panvera, Madison, WI). T1R2 or T1R3 or their mutants or chimeras were transfected using 0.6 μg of plasmid, Gαl6-i3 or Gα16-igust at 0.3 μg, and pDsRed-2 vector at 0.1 μg per well. We found that Gα16-i3 produced a larger signal than Gα16-igust, so it was used for all but the initial assays. The transfection efficiencies were estimated by visualizing DsRed fluorescence or by immunohistochemistry of T1R3 and were typically >20%. After 24 h, cells were trypsinized and replated onto polylysine-coated 24- or 96-well tissue culture plates (200,000 cells/well for a 24-well plate and 40,000/well for a 96-well plate) and cultured in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and l× glutaMAX-1 (Invitrogen). After an additional 24 h, transfected cells were loaded with 200 μl for a 24-well plate or 50 μl for a 96-well plate of 3 μm fluo-4 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (Invitrogen) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Then the transfected cells were washed with DPBS once and incubated in 200 μl of DPBS/well for a 24-well plate and 50 μl for a 96-well plate. Stimulation was performed with 200 μl of DPBS supplemented with tastants. Calcium mobilization was recorded using an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope. Acquisition and data analysis of time series images were performed using Fluoview 2.1 version software. Cells were scanned at 3.2 s/image, and at the third scan, tastant was added into the recorded wells; the response was recorded for an additional 27 scans, and the total recording time was 96 s. To quantify the calcium change, ΔF/F was calculated as the change of fluorescence level of the whole image field (peak - base line) normalized to the base-line level. For those non-responding wells, ΔF/F was calculated as the change of fluorescence between the fluorescence level of the frame at which fluorescence normally reached the peak after addition of tastants and the normalized base-line level. Response Profiles—For each pair of T1R2 and T1R3, the calcium response to six sweeteners was recorded. The typical concentration of sweeteners was as follows: sucrose (75 mm), monellin (0.1%, 89 μm), brazzein (0.25%, 380 μm), d-tryptophan (10 mm), aspartame (2.5 mm), and N-saccharin (1 mm). These sweeteners were chosen for their structural diversity. Brazzein was a gift from Dr. Hellekant; monellin, d-tryptophan, and N-saccharin were purchased from Sigma, and aspartame was purchased from Lab Safety Chemical. Immunostaining—HEK293E cells were transfected with T1R2 + T1R3 or T1R3 mutants, and Gα16-i3. After 24 h, transfected HEK293E cells were replated onto polylysine-coated coverslips. After an additional 24 h of growth in low glucose medium supplemented with glutaMAX-1 and dialyzed fetal bovine serum, cells were rinsed with 1× DPBS and then fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. After three washes with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, cells were blocked in 2% horse serum for 20 min and then incubated with anti-T1R3 polyclonal antibody (see below) for 30 min. Alexa fluro-488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were used to visualize the staining. Polyclonal antibodies were made against epitopes within the extracellular domain of mT1R3 (HEGLVPQHDTSGQQLGK) and hT1R3 (EEAGLRSRTRPSSP) and affinity purified using peptide columns (12Damak S. Rong M. Yasumatsu K. Kokrashvili Z. Varadarajan V. Zou S. Jiang P. Ninomiya Y. Margolskee R.F. Science. 2003; 301: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). No immunostaining was seen in mock transfected cells (supplemental Fig. 3). Using these antibodies we observed specific staining of mouse (12Damak S. Rong M. Yasumatsu K. Kokrashvili Z. Varadarajan V. Zou S. Jiang P. Ninomiya Y. Margolskee R.F. Science. 2003; 301: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and human taste receptor cells (data not shown). Images were taken using an Olympus Fluoview confocal laser scanning microscope. Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer Analysis of Receptor Heteromerization—HEK293E cells in 12-well plates were transiently transfected using Mirus TransIt-293 with pairs of Rluc- and GFP fusion constructs (e.g. 0.3 μg of DNA of each pRluc-hT1R2 and pGFP-hT1R3). 48 h after transfection the cells were rinsed two times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended (by titration) into 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. 90 μl of cells (∼50,000) were transferred into triplicate wells of a 96-well microplate (white Optiwell plates from Packard). To start the assay, 10 μl of Deep BlueC coelenterazine was added to each well to a final concentration of 5 μm. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) readings were performed using a FUSION plate reader (Packard). The BRET ratio was defined as ((emission at 500–530) - (emission 370–450) × Cf)/(emission at 370–450), where Cf corresponds to (emission at 500–530)/(emission at 370–450) for the receptor-Rluc construct expressed alone in the same experiment. Activation of Human Sweet Receptors by Brazzein—Heterologously expressed hT1R2 + hT1R3 has been shown to respond to many sweeteners, including monellin and thaumatin (1Li X. Staszewski L. Xu H. Durick K. Zoller M. Adler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4692-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 2Nelson G. Hoon M.A. Chandrashekar J. Zhang Y. Ryba N.J. Zuker C.S. Cell. 2001; 106: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). To determine whether hT1R2 + hT1R3 responds as well to brazzein, we expressed these receptors together and singly in HEK293E cells along with a chimeric G-protein, Gα16-i3. Consistent with earlier characterizations of the sweet receptor, HEK293E cells expressing hT1R2 + hT1R3 responded to all tested sweet compounds, including d-tryptophan, N-saccharin, sucrose, aspartame, and monellin (Fig. 1A). As expected, HEK293E cells expressing hT1R2 + hT1R3 responded to brazzein with a strong calcium response (Fig. 1, A and B). Responses to Brazzein Require hT1R3—To determine whether responsiveness to brazzein depends on hT1R2, we compared the responses to brazzein, as well as five other sweeteners, in cells transfected with same species pairs of T1R2 + T1R3 (i.e. hT1R2 + hT1R3, mT1R2 + mT1R3) or species-mismatched pairs (i.e. hT1R2 + mT1R3, mT1R2 + hT1R3) (Fig. 1A). As expected, the mT1R2 + mT1R3 receptor did not respond to brazzein or the other human-specific sweet ligands (aspartame and monellin). Although monellin and aspartame activated the hT1R2 + mT1R3 receptor, brazzein did not. This indicates that hT1R3 is required for brazzein-induced activity. Cells transfected with hT1R2 + mT1R3 displayed robust responses to the small molecule sweeteners but a reduced response to monellin, suggesting that hT1R3 also contributes to responsiveness of the receptor to monellin. The response of hT1R2-containing receptors to the small molecule sweeteners was either unaffected or somewhat enhanced by the presence of mT1R3 in place of hT1R3 (Fig. 1A). We saw no response to any of the tested sweeteners in the mT1R2 + hT1R3 pairing. Although mT1R2 + hT1R3 heterodimers formed (data not shown) 2Q. Ji., P. Jiang, Z. Liu, L. A. Snyder, L. M. J. Benard, R. F. Margolskee, and M. Max, manuscript in preparation. and this receptor was located at the membrane (Fig. 1C), the resulting receptor was not stimulated by any of the ligands tested. Lack of activity could result from an inability to bind ligand or from an inability to be stabilized by ligand in the active conformation. Human Residues in the ATD of T1R2 Are Required for Responses to Monellin—To determine whether the extracellular or transmembrane/intracellular portions of hT1R2 were required for the response of the sweet receptor to monellin, we made a human/mouse chimera joining the extracellular domain of hT1R2 (residues 1–564) to the mouse transmembrane/intracellular domain of mT1R2 (mouse residues 569–843, corresponding to human 565–839). Chimera designations follow a scheme where the residues from hT1R2 or hT1R3 are specified in the name of the construct and the mouse portion of T1R3 indicated at the 5′ or 3′ end. (In this case, h.1–564.mT1R2 contains hT1R2 residues 1–564 and the remaining 3′ end residues come from mT1R2.) The human/mouse chimera (h.1–564.mT1R2) was cotransfected with mT1R3 and G-protein and tested for responses to the panel of sweeteners (Fig. 1D). The response profile of mT1R3 + T1R2 chimera was indistinguishable from that of mT1R3 + fully human hT1R2, indicating that the human-specific residues of hT1R2 required for the sweet receptor to respond to monellin all reside in the extracellular portion. Human Residues in the Cysteine-rich Region of T1R3 Are Required for Responses to Brazzein—That hT1R2 + mT1R3 did not respond to brazzein suggests that human-specific residues in hT1R3 are required for this response. This contrasts with the other human-specific sweeteners that activated hT1R2 + mT1R3 (1Li X. Staszewski L. Xu H. Durick K. Zoller M. Adler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4692-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 2Nelson G. Hoon M.A. Chandrashekar J. Zhang Y. Ryba N.J. Zuker C.S.

We reasoned that the human-specific residues in T1R3 required for responsiveness to brazzein would reside in the ATD. To map the portion of hT1R3 essential for brazzein-induced activity, we generated several human/mouse chimeras encompassing the entire extracellular domain containing the presumptive ligand-binding domain and the cysteine-rich region (Fig. 2, A and B). The T1R3 chimeras, in combination with hT1R2, were tested for responses to brazzein and the panel of sweeteners. Only two chimeras, h.1–567.mT1R3 and h.1–545.mT1R3, responded to brazzein (Fig. 2B). h.1–567.mT1R3 displayed enhanced responses to brazzein, monellin, and aspartame, whereas h.1–545.mT1R3 had diminished responses to all sweeteners. The other constructs with less extensive 5′ hT1R3 sequences (e.g. h.1–535.mT1R3) did not respond to brazzein but did respond to all other sweeteners in the panel and in some cases showed large increases in responsiveness to the small molecule sweeteners. These results indicate that human-specific residues of hT1R3 between 536 and 545 are required for responses to brazzein. To determine whether hT1R3 residues upstream of amino acid 536 are required for responses to brazzein we constructed a series of chimeras where the amino-terminal residues of hT1R3 were replaced by the corresponding residues from mT1R3 (Fig. 2, A and C). Chimeras that retained 3′ hT1R3 residues from 536 onward (e.g. mT1R3.h.536–852) responded to brazzein. Chimeras with less extensive 3′ ends from hT1R3 (e.g. mT1R3.h.546–852) did not respond to brazzein. These results confirm that hT1R3 residues between 536 and 545 are required for responses to brazzein. To confirm directly that only this restricted portion of T1R3 need be of human origin to elicit a response to brazzein, we replaced the corresponding mT1R3 residues in this region with human residues 536–545 and then tested the activity of the resulting “humanized” construct (named mT1R3(h536–545)) in the presence of hT1R2. The response of the mT1R3(h536–545) construct to brazzein and the other sweeteners in our panel was similar to that of hT1R3 (Fig. 2D), confirming the importance of this region in determining responsiveness to brazzein. Ala-537 and Phe-540 Are Important for hT1R3 Responses to Brazzein—Within region 536–545 of hT1R3 there are five amino acids that differ from mT1R3 (Fig. 3A). We mutated singly each of these five amino acids of hT1R3 to their mouse counterpart and then tested for “loss of function” (Fig. 3B). Significantly diminished responses to brazzein were seen with the A537T and F540P mutants. hT1R3(A537T) lost all responsiveness to brazzein but retained responses to the small molecule sweeteners and to monellin. hT1R3(F540P) had greatly diminished responses to brazzein, normal responses to monellin, and greatly elevated responses to the small molecule sweeteners (Fig. 3B). The selective and severe loss of responsiveness to brazzein by hT1R3(A537T) demonstrates that Ala-537 is an essential determinant of the response of hT1R3 to brazzein. The hT1R3(G542N) mutation had no effect on T1R3 responses to brazzein or other sweeteners (Fig. 3B). The hT1R3(E545Q) mutant had decreased responsiveness to brazzein, and similarly decreased responses to the other sweeteners (Fig. 3B) that may be due to reduced efficacy of the receptor (surface expression and BRET activity for E545Q was normal (supplemental Figs. 1A and 2)). The responses of hT1R3(I536F) to all sweeteners were reduced in comparison with those of wild-type hT1R3, with a relative increase in responses to monellin over brazzein and to the protein sweeteners over the small molecule sweeteners (Fig. 3B). Thus, it appears that only A537T and F540P differentiate hT1R3 from mT1R3 in determining responsiveness to brazzein. To determine whether substitution of any of these amino acids conferred brazzein responsiveness on mT1R3 we mutated singly each of these five amino acids of mT1R3 to the human counterpart and then tested for “gain of function” (Fig. 3C). Only the T542A mutation conferred brazzein responsiveness upon mT1R3, confirming the importance of Ala-537 for the responses of hT1R3 to brazzein. The other mouse to human mutations in this segment did not rescue brazzein activity but did have effects on the relative responses to other sweeteners in the test panel, implicating this region in determining, at least in part, responses to monellin and the small molecule sweeteners (see “Discussion”). T542A and P545F Confer Brazzein Responsiveness on mT1R3—In comparison with hT1R3, the mT1R3(T542A) mutant displayed reduced responsiveness to brazzein, suggesting that other residues might also contribute to the ability of hT1R3 to respond to brazzein. (Fig. 4A). Double and triple mutations were made by replacing mouse residues in mT1R3 with their corresponding human residues. The mutants tested were mT1R3(AF) (substituted by T542A and P545F), mT1R3(IA) (substituted by F541I and T542A), mT1R3(IF) (substituted by F541I and P545F), and mT1R3(IAF) (substituted by F541I, T542A, and P545F) (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, only those mutants containing the T542A substitution responded to brazzein, but those that also contained the P545F substitution showed a greater response than did mT1R3(IA) or mT1R3(T542A) (Fig. 4, B and C). To more fully characterize the effects of humanizing mT1R3 we determined brazzein dose-response curves for several mT1R3 mutants (paired with hT1R2) (Fig. 4C). mT1R3(AF) was nearly identical to hT1R3 in its response to brazzein (EC50 = 6.10 × 10-5 for mT1R3(AF) and EC50 = 8.66 × 10-5 for hT1R3). In comparison with hT1R3, mT1R3(IAF) had increased apparent affinity for brazzein, as measured by receptor activity (EC50 = 1.20 × 10-5) but an equivalent maximal response. mT1R3(IAFGE) had increased apparent affinity (EC50 = 2.12 × 10-5) and a greater maximal response indicative of increased efficacy of the receptor. mT1R3(T542A) had greatly reduced apparent affinity for brazzein (EC50 ≥ to 1.11 × 10-3). Although mT1R3 paired with hT1R2 responds to monellin (EC50 of 6.90 × 10-5), it is with much lower apparent affinity than that shown by hT1R3 + hT1R2 (EC50 of 1.13 × 10-5) (Fig. 4D). Responses to monellin were also altered by mutations in this region. The dose-response curves (Fig. 4D) showed that several of these mutants left-shifted the responses to monellin to varying degrees; mT1R3(P545F) (EC50 of 9.39 × 10-6) was comparable with hT1R3, mT1R3(AF) (EC50 of 4.06 × 10-6) was more sensitive than hT1R3, and mT1R3(IAFGE) (EC50 of 2.05 × 10-5) was slightly less sensitive than hT1R3. Ala-537 and Phe-540 Substitutions Affect T1R3 Responses to Many Sweeteners—To investigate the physicochemical effects of residues Ala-537 and Phe-540 of hT1R3 on receptor activity toward brazzein, monellin, and small molecule sweeteners, we made various substitutions at these two positions (Fig. 5, A and C). As with the A537T mutant, substitution of Ala-537 by serine, glutamine, or valine abolished responses to brazzein without affecting the responses to monellin or the other sweeteners (Fig. 5B). hT1R3(A537G) had a markedly diminished response to brazzein and diminished responses to monellin and the other sweeteners (Fig. 5B). hT1R3(A537P) lost responsiveness to all of the sweeteners in our test panel. The surface expression of these mutants was comparable with that of hT1R3, and the BRET activities of hT1R2 + mutants were indistinguishable from those of hT1R2 + hT1R3 (supplemental Figs. 1B and 2). Substitution of hT1R3 Phe-540 with alanine, histidine, leucine, or tryptophan retained responses to all sweeteners but altered responses to some sweeteners depending on the particular substitution (Fig. 5, B and C). For example, hT1R3(F540Y) showed a selective decrease in response to brazzein, whereas hT1R3(F540L) showed an increased response to brazzein and a small decrease in its response to monellin. hT1R3(F540A) and hT1R3(F540H) were less responsive to both monellin and brazzein than was wild-type hT1R3; the responses of these mutants to the small molecule sweeteners were somewhat higher than those of wild-type hT1R3. A similar BRET activity was observed for hT1R2 + mutants or + hT1R3 (supplemental Fig. 1c). The Cysteine-rich Region of T1R3 Determines Sweet Receptor Responsiveness to Brazzein—That hT1R2 + hT1R3 responds to brazzein but hT1R2 + mT1R3 does not demonstrates that brazzein requires the human form of T1R3. This was a surprising result in that other human-specific sweeteners only required T1R2 to be from human (1Li X. Staszewski L. Xu H. Durick K. Zoller M. Adler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4692-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 2Nelson G. Hoon M.A. Chandrashekar J. Zhang Y. Ryba N.J. Zuker C.S.

Cell. 2003; 115: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Using human/mouse chimeras of T1R3 paired with hT1R2, we determined that hT1R3 residues 536–545 within the cysteine-rich region were required for responsiveness to brazzein. Ala-537 and Phe-540 within this region of hT1R3 were shown to be critical for responsiveness to brazzein. hT1R2 + humanized mT1R3 with human substitutions at these two positions fully supported the human-like response to brazzein. Effects of Substitutions at Ala-537 and Phe-540 of hT1R3 on Receptor Responses—Substitution of hT1R3 Ala-537 with threonine, serine, glutamine, or valine abolished responses to brazzein. Only the A537G mutant retained partial activity toward brazzein; however, this mutation also suppressed responses to the other sweeteners tested, suggesting that sweetener signal transmission in general may be altered in this mutant. The inability of valine, a small hydrophobic residue, to substitute for A537, and the partial activity seen with A537G suggest that it is the small size of the side chain of alanine that is important at this position. Presumably, steric hindrance by the larger side chains of threonine, serine, glutamine, or valine led to the lack of responses shown by these mutants. Because the majority of Ala-537 substitutions selectively affected responses to brazzein, it seems likely that this is steric interference acting on the binding site of brazzein, either directly or indirectly. The A537P substitution of hT1R3 resulted in a receptor that was unresponsive to all sweeteners tested. Ala-537 is in a segment predicted to have a β strand conformation (20Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). The neighboring C538 residue is predicted to be buried and may be in a disulfide bond with another conserved cysteine in this region (20Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). A change in backbone flexibility (either more flexible (A537G) or less flexible and kinked (A537P)) might alter the formation of the predicted β strand and thereby alter the conformation of this region in a way that makes it less able to transmit the signal through the receptor. This suggests that the cysteine-rich region may couple ligand binding effects in the ATD to receptor output in the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain to modulate the strength of coupling. It is particularly surprising to find such an effect for the cysteine-rich region of T1R3 in light of T1R2 appearing to be the ligand-binding monomer for most ligands (1Li X. Staszewski L. Xu H. Durick K. Zoller M. Adler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4692-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 2Nelson G. Hoon M.A. Chandrashekar J. Zhang Y. Ryba N.J. Zuker C.S.

Cell. 2003; 115: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Thus, mutations at Ala-537 (and at F540, see below) may exert two separate effects: 1) altered access to the brazzein binding site and 2) altered signal transmission for all sweeteners in our test panel. Specific mutations at position Phe-540 reduced the response to brazzein (F540Y, F540P), to monellin (F540L), or to brazzein and monellin (F540A and F540H). In addition, hT1R3 (F540P) also enhanced responses to the small molecule sweeteners. Substitution of hT1R3 by proline, native to mT1R3 at this position, makes the response profile of hT1R2 + hT1R3 (F540P) nearly identical to that of hT1R2 + mT1R3, indicating that this substitution plays a key role in differentiating responses of the wild-type human receptor (hT1R2 + hT1R3) from those of the mixed species receptor (hT1R2 + mT1R3) (see Fig. 1B). Brazzein-induced activity of T1R3 benefits from large nonpolar side groups at position 540, although there is not a strict requirement for a hydrophobic residue here, because tyrosine at this position supported near normal activity. Monellin-induced activity was best supported by Phe-540 itself or F540Y, suggesting that an aromatic residue is important for this response. The selective alteration of responses to brazzein by some T1R3 mutants at Ala-537 and Phe-540 argues that at least some of the essential interactions of brazzein with the receptor occur at a site distinct from the small molecule binding site, i.e. the brazzein and small molecule binding site (presumed to be in the cleft of T1R2) may not overlap in part or in entirety. The Effect of T1R2 on Brazzein-induced Activity—It is tempting to assume that brazzein, unlike the other human-specific sweet ligands, interacts primarily with T1R3 because it is the species of T1R3 monomer that determines responsiveness to brazzein. In preliminary studies, we have determined that hT1R2 is better able than mT1R2, when paired with the humanized mT1R3, to support brazzein activity, suggesting that there are human T1R2 residues that interact favorably with brazzein (data not shown). This suggests that brazzein may interact with both T1R2 and T1R3. We and others have modeled the structure of brazzein docked to hT1R3 (21Temussi P.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or hT1R2 (data not shown); such models may prove useful for generating testable hypotheses regarding the structure of receptor-sweetener complexes.

Recent evidence suggested that the calcium-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin could play a role in alkaline stress signaling. By using an aequorin luminescence reporter, we showed that alkaline stress resulted in a sharp and transient rise in cytoplasmic calcium. This increase was largely abolished by addition of EGTA to the medium or in cells lacking Mid1 or Cch1, components of the high affinity cell membrane calcium channel. Under these circumstances, the alkaline response of different calcineurin-sensitive transcriptional promoters was also blocked. Therefore, exposure to alkali resulted in entry of calcium from the external medium, and this triggered a calcineurin-mediated response. The involvement of calcineurin and Crz1/Tcn1, the transcription factor activated by the phosphatase, in the transcriptional response triggered by alkalinization has been globally assessed by DNA microarray analysis in a time course experiment using calcineurin-deficient (cnb1) and crz1 mutants. We found that exposure to pH 8.0 increased at least 2-fold the mRNA levels of 266 genes. In many cases (60%) the response was rather early (peak after 10 min). The transcriptional response of 27 induced genes (10%) was reduced or fully abolished in cnb1 cells. In general, the response of crz1 mutants was similar to that of calcineurin-deficient cells. By analysis of a systematic deletion library, we found 48 genes whose mutation resulted in increased sensitivity to the calcineurin inhibitor FK506.

Calcium-mediated signaling mechanisms are used by virtually every eukaryotic cell to regulate a wide variety or cellular processes, including gene expression. Transient increases in cytosolic calcium results in activation of diverse enzymes, such as the protein phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin is a heterodimer of catalytic subunit and regulatory subunits. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the catalytic subunit is encoded by two genes, CNA1 and CNA2 (1Cyert M.S. Kunisawa R.

These findings led us to speculate the possibility that exposure to alkaline pH could trigger a burst in cytoplasmic calcium, which in turn would activate the phosphatase. Here we confirm and expand this hypothesis by showing that alkalinization of the medium provokes entry of calcium from the external medium and by defining, using DNA microarray technology, the subset of genes whose alkaline transcriptional response is mediated by the calcineurin pathway.

Laub M. Liao H. Davis R.W. Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3212) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used spanned nucleotides –489 to +2021 (MID1) and –532 to +6708 (CCH1). Positions are relative to the initiating ATG codon. The amplification fragments were purified and used to transform the DBY746 wild type strain. A deletion cassette used to disrupt the YVC1 gene (pΔYVC1_Wa) was generated as follows. The region from –1118 to +3010 relative to the ATG of the YVC1 locus was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA prepared from the DBY746 wild type strain by using oligonucleotides 5′-GCTCTAGAAGCTTCATGGATACTTC-3′ (which contains an artificial XbaI site) and 5′-GCGGTACCACCATTGGTGCAGCATTC-3′ (which has an added KpnI restriction site). This fragment was cloned into the same sites of plasmid pBluescript and was digested with EcoRI to remove a 1.8-kbp internal region (from nucleotide –41 to +1780). To generate pΔYVC1_Wa, this region was replaced by an EcoRI fragment, containing the TRP1 marker, isolated from plasmid pUC19_W_2RI. This construct was made by cloning into pBluescript the TRP1-containing SmaI-NheI fragment of YDpW (19Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), to yield pBS_W, and recovering the marker as an HincII-SacI fragment, for final cloning into pUC19. Strain RSC46 (yvc1::TRP1), was then generated by transformation with the 2.1-kbp SpeI-HpaI fragment isolated from pΔYVC1_Wa. All gene disruptions were verified by PCR. The reporter plasmid pPRX1-LacZ was generated as follows. The PRX1 upstream DNA region enclosed between –1288 and +33 (relative to the starting ATG) was amplified by PCR with added EcoRI/HindIII restriction sites and was cloned into the same sites of YEp357 (20Myers A.M.

Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 250 μl of fresh medium containing 2 μm coelenterazine (Sigma) and incubated for 5.5 h in the dark. The culture was centrifuged, and cells were resuspended in 173 μl of fresh medium (which included 10 mm EGTA when chelating external calcium was desired). Three μl of the culture was removed, and cells were fixed by addition of a formaldehyde solution (7% v/v final concentration) and kept at 4 °C for cell counting. The remaining culture was transferred to luminometer tubes after 15 min (to ensure that the transient calcium increase induced by the glucose present in the fresh medium has vanished), and then the luminescence was integrated every second by using a Berthold LB9507 luminometer. Calcium shock was performed by adding 30 μlof a 1.33 m calcium chloride solution. Alkaline shock was accomplished by adding 30 μl of 100 mm KOH (which raises the pH to ∼8.2). Potassium chloride was added as a negative control at the same concentration as KOH. In all experiments, the luminescence values were corrected according to the number of cells present in the sample.

The cultures were replicated by using a stainless steel 96-pin replicator (Nalge Nunc International) into duplicate 96-well plates. One set of plates contained 200 μl/well YPD (control plates) and the other YPD plus 1.5 μg/ml FK506 (Fujisawa Co.). Growth was monitored by using a Labsystem multiwell photometer at A620 after 18, 20, 22, 24, and 48 h of incubation at 28 °C. For each clone, the ratio between the absorbance of the culture in the absence and in the presence of the drug was calculated. This value was divided by the average of the ratios for the entire plate (to normalize for hypothetical differences in the inoculation step). Clones giving a growth ratio equal or higher than 2.0 were initially considered positive. These clones were diluted until the A620 was 0.005 and re-tested for FK506 sensitivity at four different concentrations of the drug (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 μg/ml) at different growth times. Clones consistently yielding a ratio of at least 1.2 were considered as sensitive to FK506. The ratio of absorbance of cultures in the absence and in the presence of each concentration of the drug was calculated, and the highest value obtained was considered as an indicator of the sensitivity of the strain. β-Galactosidase Assays—The wild type DBY746 strain and its derivatives RSC46 (yvc1Δ), RSC28 (mid1Δ), and RSC31 (cch1Δ) were transformed with the reporter plasmids pAMS366 (10Stathopoulos A.M.

Cells were grown up to an A660 of 0.5–1.0, and 1-ml aliquots were made and centrifuged. Cells were resuspended in YPD media made with 50 mm TAPS and adjusted to pH 8.1 (alkaline treatment), YPD containing 0.25 mm H2O2 (oxidative stress) or YPD adjusted to pH 5.6 (untreated cells), and growth was resumed for 90 min. In all cases, β-galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (14Serrano R. Ruiz A. Bernal D. Chambers J.R. Arino J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—For RNA preparation, yeast cells were grown in YPD to an optical density of 0.8 and split into aliquots. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended either in fresh YPD (nonstressed cells, pH 6.2) or YPD containing 50 mm TAPS (stressed cells, pH 8.0) for different periods. Cultures were then centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm, and total RNA was extracted by using hot phenol and glass beads as described (22Köhrer K. Dombey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Total RNA (15 μg/lane) was transferred to filters and probed as described (14Serrano R. Ruiz A. Bernal D. Chambers J.R. Arino J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) with a 0.65-kbp fragment encompassing the entire coding region of gene PNC1. DNA Microchips Analysis—Fifteen μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis and labeling, using either the direct (CyScribe first strand labeling kit) or indirect (CyScribe post-labeling kit) labeling kits, in conjunction with Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP fluorescent nucleotides from Amersham Biosciences. Fluorescently labeled cDNAs were combined and hybridized to yeast genomic microchips constructed in our laboratory by arraying 6014 different PCR-amplified open reading frames from S. cerevisiae on CMT-Ultragaps (Corning) and Genorama SA-1 (Asper Biotech) amino-coated glass slides, using a MicroGrid™ II (BioRobotics) machine. Details on the construction of the slides will be provided elsewhere (23Alberola T.M. García-Martínez J. Antúnez O. Viladevall L. Barceló A. Ariño J. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Int. Microbiol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the slides included 286 duplicated genes, corresponding to genes responsive under a variety of stress conditions, plus a number of positive and negative control spots. Dyes were swapped for wild type and mutant cells to avoid dye-specific bias. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing conditions were essentially as described previously (24Hegde P. Qi R. Gay C. Dharap S. Hughes J.E. Snesrud E. Lee N. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 548-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Slides were scanned with a ScanArray 4000 fluorescence scanner and analyzed using both commercial (QuantArray) and in-house developed software. The data from different experiments (5 slides/time point for wild type and cnb1 cells and 3 slides/time point for crz1/tcn1 cells) were combined, and the median was calculated. A given gene was considered to be induced or repressed when the ratio stressed/nonstressed was higher than 2.0 or lower than 0.5, respectively, in at least three (for wild type and cnb1 cells) or two experiments (for crz1 cells). Expression ratios were logarithm (base 2)-transformed for statistical analysis. Statistical significance of both gene induction and repression was assessed by testing the null hypothesis log ratio equal to zero under the Student's t test. A p value lower than 0.1 was considered significant for initial gene selection. The differences between the three strains (wild type, cnb1, and crz1) for each selected gene was analyzed by a two-way (slide/time, strain) analysis of variance. The post hoc Tukey's test was used for multiple comparisons between strains (25Cui X. Churchill G.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4 (Epub 2003 March 17): 210Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) with statistical significance set at a p value lower than 0.05. Data analysis was carried out with the SAS/STAT® release 8.01 statistical package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Quantitative Real Time PCR—First strand cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA, using the Reverse Transcription System (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time PCR analysis of PNC1, SPI1, and PRB1 expression was carried out in the ABI Prism 7900 HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). RPL28, which was not induced by alkali, was used as a control. A 20-μl amplification reaction was set up by mixing 2 μl of a 100-fold dilution of the first strand cDNA reaction, 2× SYBRGreen Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 900 nm primer pairs (ISOGEN Bioscience) designed using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). The following forward and reverse primers were used for amplification: PNC1-Fw, 5′-CAC CCT TCC AGA CAT ATT TCG TT-3′, and PNC1-Rw, 5′-ATA CCC TCT TGC GTG GAA TCA T-3′; SPI1-Fw, 5′-CTA GTT CCT CTG TAA TCG TGG TAC CAT-3′, and SPI1-Rw, TGC AGT AGC AGT CGA GTT GTA GAA TAT T; PRB1_Fw, 5′-TGC TTT GGT CAT CCC AAA TCT-3′, and PRB1_Rw, 5′-TCT GGG TCT CTC GTG GTG ATC-3′; and RPL28-Fw, 5′-GTT ATC GTC AAA GCT AGA TTC G-3′, and RPL28-Rw, 5′-ACC AGC AGC TCT GAT TTT T-3′. Reaction parameters are as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Two different extractions of total RNA were analyzed, at least by duplicate PCRs. The results presented are the mean of the two different RNA extractions. Basic analysis was performed by using SDS software (Applied Biosystems). The 2–ΔΔCt method (26Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127156) Google Scholar) was used for relative quantification using the cDNA from the noninduced sample of each strain as calibrator and RPL28 as the endogenous control. Evaluation of Oxidative Stress after High pH Exposure—Exponentially growing wild type DBY746 cells (A660 0.5) in YPD medium were incubated for 1 h with dihydrorhodamine 123 (D1054, Sigma) at 2.5 μg/ml essentially as described previously (27Cabiscol E. Belli G. Tamarit J. Echave P. Herrero E. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44531-44538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Aliquots were taken and made 30 mm KOH (which raised the pH to 8.1) or 2 mm hydrogen peroxide and further incubated with shaking for 30 and 90 min, respectively. Cultures were centrifuged, and cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline solution and examined through a fluorescein filter using a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope. The percentage of cells showing fluorescence was determined after scoring ∼2000 cells for each condition. Exposure of Yeast Cells to Alkaline pH Results in a Transient Increase in Cytoplasmic Calcium Levels—To evaluate the changes in cytoplasmic calcium after exposure of yeast cells to alkalinization of the medium, the wild type strain JA100 was transformed with a plasmid expressing the luminescent Ca+2 reporter aequorin and then challenged with 15 mm potassium hydroxide, to raise the pH to 8.1. This treatment resulted in a sharp increase in luminescence, which peaked about 15–20 s after the treatment and declined to base-line levels after approximately 1 min, indicating a transient increase in cytosolic calcium level (Fig. 1A). Treatment of the cells with KCl under the same conditions, which does not result in pH change, did not elicit this response. Exposure of the cells to 0.2 m CaCl2 resulted in a sharp increase in luminescence, with kinetics very similar to the calcium burst induced by exposure to alkali. The intracellular calcium increase observed in response to alkali was confirmed in three different wild type strains available in our laboratory, although the intensity of the response varies from strain to strain. In fact, in strain DBY746 the calcium burst triggered by alkali was particularly intense, even more than that observed in response to 0.2 m CaCl2 (compare Figs. 1 and 2). For this reason we selected this strain for further studies. The effect of pH on cytoplasmic calcium increase was dose-dependent. As shown in Fig. 1B, the increase becomes noticeable when cells are exposed to pH 7.5 and maximal at pH 8.2. These results indicate that budding yeast responds to alkaline stress with an intense and transient calcium burst.Fig. 2Effect of mutations affecting calcium fluxes in the response to alkaline pH. Wild type strain DBY746 and its isogenic derivatives RSC46 (yvc1Δ), RSC28 (mid1Δ), and RSC31 (cch1Δ) were subjected to alkaline shock (pH 8.2), and intracellular calcium was measured as described for Fig. 1A. When included, EGTA was present in the medium at 10 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To characterize the origin of the calcium, we repeated these experiments under different conditions by using mutants in genes involved in calcium homeostasis. Most interestingly, we observed that addition of the calcium chelating EGTA to the medium resulted in an almost negligible increase in intracellular calcium. As this could indicate that the main source for intracellular calcium may be of extracellular origin, we evaluated the intensity of the calcium burst in cells lacking genes encoding components of the main calcium channel, such as mid1 and cch1 mutants. As shown in Fig. 2, the calcium burst in response to alkalinization was largely abolished in both cases. In contrast, mutation of YVC1, encoding a vacuolar membrane channel responsible for release of calcium from the vacuole to the cytosol, resulted in a ca"
https://openalex.org/W2055571033,"The identification of tumor-suppressor genes in solid tumors by classical cancer genetics methods is difficult and slow. We combined nonsense-mediated RNA decay microarrays and array-based comparative genomic hybridization for the genome-wide identification of genes with biallelic inactivation involving nonsense mutations and loss of the wild-type allele. This approach enabled us to identify previously unknown mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase gene EPHB2. The DU 145 prostate cancer cell line, originating from a brain metastasis, carries a truncating mutation of EPHB2 and a deletion of the remaining allele. Additional frameshift, splice site, missense and nonsense mutations are present in clinical prostate cancer samples. Transfection of DU 145 cells, which lack functional EphB2, with wild-type EPHB2 suppresses clonogenic growth. Taken together with studies indicating that EphB2 may have an essential role in cell migration and maintenance of normal tissue architecture, our findings suggest that mutational inactivation of EPHB2 may be important in the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2005216066,"Two new globin proteins have recently been discovered in vertebrates, neuroglobin in neurons and cytoglobin in all tissues, both showing heme hexacoordination by the distal His(E7) in the absence of gaseous ligands. In analogy to hemoglobin and myoglobin, neuroglobin and cytoglobin are supposedly involved in O2 storage and delivery, although their physiological role remains to be solved. Here we report O2 equilibria of recombinant human neuroglobin (NGB) and cytoglobin (CYGB) measured under close to physiological conditions and at varying temperature and pH ranges. NGB shows both alkaline and acid Bohr effects (pH-dependent O2 affinity) and temperature-dependent enthalpy of oxygenation. O2 and CO binding equilibrium studies on neuroglobin mutants strongly suggest that the bound O2 is stabilized by interactions with His(E7) and that this residue functions as a major Bohr group in the presence of Lys(E10). As shown by the titration of free thiols with 4,4′-dithiodipyridine and by mass spectrometry, this mechanism of modulating O2 affinity is independent of formation of an internal disulfide bond under the experimental conditions used, which stabilize thiols in the reduced form. In CYGB, O2 binding is cooperative, consistent with its proposed dimeric structure. Similar to myoglobin but in contrast to NGB, O2 binding to CYGB is pH-independent and exothermic throughout the temperature range investigated. Our data support the hypothesis that CYGB may be involved in O2-requiring metabolic processes. In contrast, the lower O2 affinity in NGB does not appear compatible with a physiological role involving mitochondrial O2 supply at the low O2 tensions found within neurons.

An important characteristic is their heme hexacoordination in the absence of exogenous ligands where the distal histidine, His(E7), occupies the sixth coordination position of the iron atom in both the ferrous and the ferric valency states (7Pesce A.

Before the discovery of Ngb and Cygb, globin heme hexacoordination was regarded as a feature of certain plant hemoglobins and invertebrate or bacterial globins but not of vertebrate globins. In contrast to Ngb and Cygb, Hb and Mb are present at high levels (mm range) in the red blood cells and in the striated muscle of vertebrates and show pentacoordinate heme geometry when deoxygenated. Despite their low degree of sequence similarity with other vertebrate globins, human NGB and CYGB show the same characteristic α-helix globin fold as vertebrate Hb and Mb (7Pesce A. Dewilde S.

Pesce A. Moens L. Ascenzi P. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A phylogenetic tree for human globin proteins indicates that NGB diverged early in evolution and may represent the most ancestral human globin protein, whereas CYGB appears to be more closely related to Mb (13Pesce A. Bolognesi M. Bocedi A. Ascenzi P. Dewilde S. Moens L. Hankeln T. Burmester T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Despite their ancient origin, neither protein has changed significantly during evolution (13Pesce A. Bolognesi M. Bocedi A. Ascenzi P. Dewilde S. Moens L. Hankeln T. Burmester T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1146-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), which may reflect conservation of a critical biological function. Although monomeric, Ngb is capable of conformational changes that affect ligand affinity. A number of studies have reported the existence of at least two identifiable conformations on the basis of heterogeneity of reaction rates (8Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36377-36382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) that are indicative of an open and closed conformation of the heme pocket. Two distinguishable conformations resulting in a different heme pocket accessibility have been identified in a CYGB mutant by x-ray crystallography (10de Sanctis D. Dewilde S. Pesce A. Moens L. Ascenzi P. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Also, the formation of an internal disulfide bond increases the rate of dissociation of the distal His from the heme and thereby O2 affinity in NGB and to a lesser extent in CYGB (17Hamdane D. Kiger L. Dewilde S. Green B.N. Pesce A. Uzan J. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Bolognesi M. Moens L. Marden M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51713-51721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Although our knowledge of the structural properties of Ngb and Cygb is rapidly increasing, the physiological role of Ngb and Cygb is still largely unknown. A major hint to the role of Ngb came from the work of Sun et al. (18Sun Y. Jin K. Peel A. Mao X.O. Xie L. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 19Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X.O. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15306-15311Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) who found that Ngb may protect neurons during episodes of O2 lack. This important finding has been often referred to in the context of the general view that Ngb is involved in O2 binding and delivery to sustain mitochondrial respiration similar to Hb and Mb. Remarkably, the function of certain nerve globins from invertebrates, whose sequence similarity with mammalian Ngbs is relatively high (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar), is to supply O2 to the nerves (20Kraus D.W. Colacino J.M. Science. 1986; 232: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Another piece of evidence is that Ngb appears located in the vicinity of mitochondria as clearly shown in histochemical studies performed on retina sections (2Schmidt M. Giessl A. Laufs T. Hankeln T. Wolfrum U. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1932-1935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In contrast, Cygb has recently been proposed to be involved in O2-requiring steps in the synthesis of collagen based on its expression pattern in fibrotic cells (21Schmidt M. Gerlach F. Avivi A. Laufs T. Wystub S. Simpson J.C. Nevo E. Saaler-Reinhardt S. Reuss S. Hankeln T. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8063-8069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Still, practically no direct measurements have been undertaken yet on the O2 affinity of either Ngb or Cygb to validate these hypotheses, as the frequently reported P50 value of 1 torr for NGB has been mainly derived on the basis of kinetic rate constants (8Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Moreover, discrepancies on this value exist because another kinetic study reported a ∼1000-fold higher O2 affinity of NGB (22Trent III, J.T. Watts R.A. Hargrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30106-30110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we have used equilibrium methods to directly measure O2 binding curves for NGB and CYGB, which are reported in this study. Alternative hypotheses on the functional role of Ngb exist. In accordance with its protective effect during hypoxia (18Sun Y. Jin K. Peel A. Mao X.O. Xie L. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 19Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X.O. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15306-15311Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), we have recently shown (14Herold S. Fago A. Weber R.E. Dewilde S. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22841-22847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) that NGB in its Fe(II)NO (nitric oxide) form is an efficient scavenger of peroxynitrite, which is generated at high rate following brain ischemia (23Lipton P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1431-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to Hb and Mb, NGB apparently does not generate the cytotoxic ferryl Fe(IV) form of the protein in the reaction with peroxides (14Herold S. Fago A. Weber R.E. Dewilde S. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22841-22847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, these observations do not preclude a possible role of NGB in O2 metabolism, given that Hb and Mb may also scavenge peroxynitrite and other reactive O2 species (24Alayash A.I. Patel R.P. Cashon R.E. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To assess whether NGB and CYGB may contribute to physiological functions related to O2 transport and storage, we have studied their O2 binding equilibria over a range of pH values and temperatures and correlated these functional properties to the protein molecular structure and to existing data on O2 levels present in intact cells. Reagents—The reagent 4,4′-dithiodipyridine (4-PDS) was from Aldrich (Aldrithiol™-4). All of the other reagents were from Sigma and of highest purity available. Water was of Milli Q grade. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant wild-type NGB and CYGB and mouse Ngb were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (8Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 10de Sanctis D. Dewilde S. Pesce A. Moens L. Ascenzi P. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The mutants of human NGB and mouse Ngb were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). The mutants of human NGB included H(E7)Q with Gln replacing His(E7), K(E10)L with Leu replacing Lys(10), the double mutant H(E7)L/K(E10)L with Leu replacing both His(E7) and Lys(E10), and the triple mutant here for simplicity called GSS where all of the cysteine residues in positions CD7, D5, and G19 are replaced by Gly, Ser, and Ser, respectively. The mouse Ngb mutant H(E7)V with Val replacing His(E7) was also used. The purity of samples was routinely checked using a PhastSystem (Amersham Biosciences) by isoelectrofocusing on polyacrylamide gels at the pH 3–9 range and by SDS 15% polyacrylamide gels. Whenever necessary, contaminants were removed by FPLC anion-exchange chromatography using a Hi-Trap Q FF 5-ml column (Amersham Biosciences) by a linear gradient of 0.2 m NaCl in 0.02 m Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA. The divalent metal chelator EDTA was routinely added to all buffers to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Human HbA0 was obtained by FPLC anion-exchange chromatography on a HiLoad 26/10 Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) using a linear gradient of 0.15 m NaCl in 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 8.3, containing 0.5 mm EDTA. Aliquots were stored in liquid N2. Purified NGB was stored in liquid N2 as either a Met or CO derivative (see below) in small aliquots (>1 mm heme). Determination of Extinction Coefficients—Absorption molar extinction coefficients of Met NGB were determined after complete oxidation of the protein by potassium ferricyanide and elimination of excess ferricyanide by gel filtration (25Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). The millimolar heme concentration of Met NGB was obtained after adding solid potassium cyanide in molar excess over heme and using the extinction coefficient of 11 mm–1 cm–1 at 540 nm for Mb (25Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients of deoxy and CO forms of NGB were obtained under anaerobic conditions by adding sodium dithionite (1 mg/ml) and CO gas in molar excess to a solution of Met NGB of a known concentration. The spectra of pure oxy NGB were measured after exposing to air the samples previously reduced to the Fe(II) form in anaerobic vials by the enzymatic reducing system described by Hayashi et al. (26Hayashi A. Suzuki T. Shin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The molar extinction coefficients of oxy NGB were then calculated from the known concentration of the Met NGB sample used. Protein Reduction—To reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) and possible S–S bonds before O2 binding equilibrium experiments, samples (>1 mm heme) were dialyzed against 1–2 mg/ml sodium dithionite and 1–2 mg/ml DTT dissolved in ice-cold 50 mm Bistris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.5 mm EDTA under strictly anaerobic conditions. The buffer was extensively bubbled with N2 and CO before the addition of solid dithionite and DTT. After a 1-h reduction, three exchanges of degassed CO-equilibrated buffer were made to eliminate dithionite and DTT. All steps were made on ice and in the dark. The reduced protein then was kept on ice in closed anaerobic vials containing CO until use for O2 equilibrium experiments (within the same day) or stored in liquid nitrogen in CO-flushed cryovials. Reduction under the air of Met Ngb by the Met enzymatic reducing system (26Hayashi A. Suzuki T. Shin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) as previously reported (8Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) was not successful in our hands. Oxygen Binding Equilibria—O2 equilibrium curves were measured on ultrathin (<0.05 mm) layers of 4-μl protein samples using a modified gas diffusion chamber fed by cascaded Wφsthoff gas-mixing pumps, which generate precise mixtures of O2 or air and ultrapure (>99.998%) N2 (27Weber R.E. Nature. 1981; 292: 386-387Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 28Weber R.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1992; 72: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The absorbance change following the stepwise increases/decreases in O2 tension was continuously monitored at a fixed wavelength in the Soret region, typically 428 nm for Ngb and 426 nm for CYGB. Equilibrium at each oxygenation step was achieved within 2–4 min, consistently with the rapid (millisecond to second) kinetics of ligand binding (17Hamdane D. Kiger L. Dewilde S. Green B.N. Pesce A. Uzan J. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Bolognesi M. Moens L. Marden M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51713-51721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the absorbance spectra (400–600 nm) were measured using a UV-visible Cary 50 Probe spectrophotometer equipped with optic fibers to verify the reversible change in the spectrum from the deoxygenated to oxygenated form. A BMS 2 MK 2 thermostated microelectrode (Radiometer) was used to measure the pH value in 100-μl subsamples. Samples were typically in 0.1 m Bistris or Hepes buffers containing 0.5 mm EDTA at a protein concentration of 0.03–0.05 mm heme. Identical binding curves were obtained in either Bistris or Hepes buffers. The effect of protein concentration on the O2 affinity was checked at pH 7.55 at 0.036 and 0.09 mm heme, which is close to the highest local concentration estimated for Ngb in retinal cells (∼0.1 mm) (2Schmidt M. Giessl A. Laufs T. Hankeln T. Wolfrum U. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1932-1935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To avoid buildup of oxidized heme during O2 equilibrium experiments, samples contained the Met-reducing enzymatic system (26Hayashi A. Suzuki T. Shin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 310: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) in the following amounts: glucose 6-phosphate (15 mm); glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.0073 mg/ml); NADP (1 mm); ferredoxin-NADP reductase (0.0017 mm); ferredoxin (0.0038 mm); and catalase (0.0015 mm). Rapid (2–3 saturation points) control experiments performed in the absence of reducing system using the H(E7)V and H(E7)Q mutants confirmed that O2 affinity was not altered by the cofactors and enzymes added. O2 binding equilibria were also measured in buffered suspensions of intact E. coli cells expressing NGB. In these experiments, the reducing enzymatic system was omitted. Values for O2 affinity (P50, O2 tension at half-saturation) and cooperativity (n50) were interpolated from the zero-intercept and the slope, respectively, of Hill plots, log[Y/(1 – Y)] versus logPO2, where Y is the O2 saturation. Autoxidation Rates—Oxygenated samples were prepared by the reduction of the Met form with sodium dithionite followed by immediate passage through a small (5 ml) PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) kept at 4 °C in order to minimize heme oxidation during desalting (∼2–3 min). Rates of spontaneous oxidation were measured in air at 25 °C from the decrease in absorbance at 576 nm over time using a HP 8543 UV-visible diode array spectrophotometer. Absorbance traces were fitted to monoexponential decays. Protein concentration was within the range of 0.006–0.010 mm. The buffer used was 0.05 m Hepes, 0.5 mm EDTA. CO Saturation Experiments—The effect of pH on CO saturation levels in NGB was investigated at 10 and 30 °C in anaerobic cells at a protein concentration of 1.5 μm heme by adding 2 μl of CO-saturated water (1 mm, Ref. 25Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar) in 0.1 m Bistris buffers containing 0.5 mm EDTA in the presence of 2 mg/ml sodium dithionite and 1 mg/ml DTT. CO saturation was calculated by multi-component spectral analysis on a HP 8543 UV-visible diode array spectrophotometer using reference spectra for pure deoxy and CO-NGB obtained as described above. Sulfhydryl Reactivity—The reaction of 4-PDS with the thiol groups of globin proteins to form 4-thiopyridone (29Grassetti D.R. Murray J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 119: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 30Bonaventura C. Tesh S. Faulkner K.M. Kraiter D. Crumbliss A.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was employed to measure free cysteines in NGB and CYGB samples at pH 7.0. To verify the propensity to form disulfide bridges under various conditions, samples were incubated for 3 h at 20°C either in 0.1 m Bistris buffer containing 0.5 mm EDTA in the presence and absence of the enzymatic Met-reducing system or in 0.1 m phosphate buffer with and without EDTA added. We used a 4-molar excess of 4-PDS over heme at a protein concentration of 0.010 mm heme. The increase in absorbance with time was monitored in quartz cuvettes at 324 nm corresponding to the maximum absorbance for 4-thiopyridone (extinction coefficient 19.8 cm–1 mm–1) using as reference a protein sample at identical heme concentration not containing 4-PDS. Reaction with 4-PDS was also employed to create the internal S–S bond between Cys(CD7) and Cys(D5) in NGB. In the reaction, derivatization of Cys(G19) with 4-PDS also occurs. According to Grassetti and Murray (29Grassetti D.R. Murray J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 119: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), free thiols are quantitatively oxidized to the S–S form when reacting with dithiopyridine, provided that they are located sufficiently close to each other. After reaction with 4-PDS, the protein was dialyzed to remove excess reagent and used in equilibrium determination of O2 binding. Mass Spectrometry—NGB dissolved in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and not previously exposed to reducing agents was analyzed by mass spectroscopy to detect the formation of internal disulfide bridge. Sample preparation was similar to that reported by Hamdane et al. (17Hamdane D. Kiger L. Dewilde S. Green B.N. Pesce A. Uzan J. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Bolognesi M. Moens L. Marden M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51713-51721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The native sample at 5 mm concentration was dissolved in 50:50 methanol: water in 5% formic acid and injected into home-made nanoelectrospray needles. Nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry spectra were acquired on a Q-TOFII (Micromass, Wythwnshave, United Kingdom) over the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) range of 700–2000. The multiple-charged electrospray spectra were deconvoluted by the MaxEnt1 software to produce the molecular mass of the protein. Before each measurement, the mass scale was calibrated using myoglobin. NGB was alkylated by adding different concentrations of iodoacetamide in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The sample was dried in a 10-kDa cut-off centrifugal filter device (Centricon YM10, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The retained proteins were then dissolved in 50:50 methanol:water in 5% formic acid, and the mass was measured as describe above. NGB was digested with trypsin overnight. The digested mixture was analyzed by Applied Biosystems 4700 MALDI-TOF/TOF. For sample loading, 5 mg ml–1 α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) was dissolved in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (70:30, v/v). A thin layer of homogeneous matrix crystals was prepared on the target by adding 0.5 ml of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and allowed to dry. 0.5 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was placed on the top of the matrix layer followed by 1 μl of trypsin-digested solution (31Kussmann M. Lassing U. Sturmer C.A. Przybylski M. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).

Other samples studied were the human NGB mutants H(E7)Q, K(E10)L, H(E7)L/K(E10)L, and GSS and mouse Ngb wild-type and mutant H(E7)V as well as NGB expressed in intact E. coli cells (Fig. 1C). Hill coefficients for NGB are close to unity, as expected for a monomeric protein (Fig. 1, A–C). In CYGB, Hill coefficients vary with temperature and are in the range of 0.63–1.63 (Fig. 1D), indicating the existence of both positive and negative heme-heme interactions. Reversible changes from deoxy to oxy absorbance spectra of NGB and CYGB are shown in Fig. 2 for a typical O2 equilibrium experiment. For both proteins, the presence of a single set of isosbestic points and of the characteristic oxy spectrum with peaks at 543 and 576 nm (Fig. 2) shows that the protein remains in the ferrous state during measurements of O2-binding equilibria. The recovery of the fully deoxygenated spectrum or absorbance value after complete oxygenation at the end of each experiment (data not shown) confirmed the absence of a significant amount of ferric protein.Table IIOxygen affinity values (P50, torr) for NGB and CYGB measured under various conditionsSampleTemperatureBufferpHP50Reference°CtorrNGB37Bistris/Hepes, EDTA, Hayashi7.17.5This studyNGB37Phosphate7.018Dewilde S.

In addition, a CSN-independent function of Jab1 is suggested but is less well characterized. To elucidate the function of Jab1, we targeted the Jab1 locus by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem cells. Jab1-null embryos died soon after implantation. Jab1-/- embryonic cells, which lacked other CSN components, expressed higher levels of p27, p53, and cyclin E, resulting in impaired proliferation and accelerated apoptosis. Jab1 heterozygous mice were healthy and fertile but smaller than their wild-type littermates. Jab1+/- mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, in which the amount of Jab1-containing small subcomplex, but not that of CSN, was selectively reduced, proliferated poorly, showed an inefficient down-regulation of p27 during G1, and was delayed in the progression from G0 to S phase by 3 h compared with the wild-type cells. Most interestingly, in Jab1+/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the levels of cyclin E and deneddylated Cul1 were unchanged, and p53 was not induced. Thus, Jab1 controls cell cycle progression and cell survival by regulating multiple cell cycle signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2083338261,"Young brood parasites that tolerate the company of host offspring challenge the existing evolutionary view of family life. In theory, all parasitic nestlings should be ruthlessly self-interested and should kill host offspring soon after hatching. Yet many species allow host young to live, even though they are rivals for host resources. Here we show that the tolerance of host nestlings by the parasitic brown-headed cowbird Molothrus ater is adaptive. Host young procure the cowbird a higher provisioning rate, so it grows more rapidly. The cowbird's unexpected altruism toward host offspring simply promotes its selfish interests in exploiting host parents."
https://openalex.org/W2097630727,"Translocated in liposarcoma (TLS) is an important protein component of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex involved in the splicing of pre-mRNA and the export of fully processed mRNA to the cytoplasm. We examined the domain organization of human TLS by a combined approach using limited proteolysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy. We found that the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and zinc finger-like domains exclusively form protease-resistant core structures within the isolated TLS protein fragments, while the remaining regions, including the Arg-Gly-Gly repeats, appear to be completely unstructured. Thus, TLS contains the unstructured N-terminal half followed by the RRM and zinc finger-like domains, which are connected to each other by a flexible linker. We also carried out NMR analyses to obtain more detailed insights into the individual RRM and zinc finger-like domains. The 113Cd NMR analysis of the zinc finger-like domain verified that zinc is coordinated with four cysteines in the C4 type scheme. We also investigated the interaction of each domain with an oligo-RNA containing the GGUG sequence, which appears to be critical for the TLS function in splicing. The backbone amide NMR chemical shift perturbation analyses indicated that the zinc finger domain binds GGUG-containing RNA with a dissociation constant of about 1.0 × 10-5m, whereas the RRM domain showed no observable interaction with this RNA. This surprising result implies that the zinc finger domain plays a more predominant role in RNA recognition than the RRM domain.

Åman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 2Ron D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 220: 131-142PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant fusion protein (TLS-CHOP), consisting of the N-terminal half of TLS and the full-length CHOP, appears to act as a potent transcription factor possibly by combining the TLS transactivation activity and the CHOP DNA binding activity. A different type of fusion protein, TLS-ERG (a member of the erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) family of transcription factors), was subsequently detected in human acute myeloid leukemia (3Ichikawa H. Shimizu K. Hayashi Y. Ohki M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2865-2868PubMed Google Scholar). The normal TLS, consisting of 526 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 53 kDa, belongs to a family including the closely related proteins Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) (4Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G. Aurias A. Thomas G. Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar) and TAFII68 (TATA-binding protein-associated factor) (5Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Thus, they are collectively called the TET (TLS, EWS, TAFII68) family. EWS and TAFII68 interact with components of the RNA polymerase II complex (5Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 6Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Moreover sarcoma-associated RNA-binding fly homologue (SARFH), a Drosophila homologue of TLS, is colocalized with the polymerase on active chromatin (7Immanuel D. Zinszner H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4562-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of TLS is involved in transcriptional activation (8Zinszner H. Albalat R. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and interacts with the polymerase (9Yang L. Embree L.J. Hickstein D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3345-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Indeed the N-terminal halves of the TET family members are rich in glutamine, serine, proline, and tyrosine, which are frequently found in transcriptional activation proteins such as SP1 and Krüppel-like transcription factors (10Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urrutia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 206.1-206.8Crossref Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The several cellular partners of TLS identified thus far function as transcription factors. For example, the N-terminal half of TLS shows high affinity for the thyroid hormone receptor, which binds to certain DNA target sites (11Powers C.A. Mathur M. Raaka B.M. Ron D. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 4-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover TLS interacts with Spi-1/PU.1, and this association impedes the transcriptional activity of Spi-1 (12Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4838-4842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). TLS was identified as the P2 component of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complex by proteomic analyses using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS) (13Calvio C. Neubauer G. Mann M. Lamond A.I. RNA. 1995; 1: 724-733PubMed Google Scholar). The hnRNP complex, consisting of more than 30 different proteins, is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and transporting fully processed mRNA to the cytoplasm. Indeed many members of the hnRNP family contain multiple RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (14Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of TLS contains several structural motifs involved in RNA binding. A sequence analysis suggested that the C-terminal half contains an RRM flanked by multiple Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) repeats on both the amino and carboxyl sides in addition to a small, putative zinc finger domain with four cysteines (15Morohoshi F. Ootsuka Y. Arai K. Ichikawa H. Mitani S. Munakata N. Ohki M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The TLS protein interacts with hnRNP A1 and hnRNP C1/C2 in the nucleus and binds mRNA in vivo (8Zinszner H. Albalat R. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2513-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, TLS is likely to play critical roles in pre-mRNA splicing and exporting fully processed mRNA to the cytoplasm. Indeed TLS exists not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm, and this shuttling depends on its C-terminal domain (16Zinszner H. Sok J. Immanuel D. Yin Y. Ron D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1741-1750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which preferably recognizes RNA containing a GGUG sequence (17Lerga A. Hallier M. Delva L. Orvain C. Gallais I. Marie J. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6807-6816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, TLS interacts with the serine-arginine family members of splicing factors through its C-terminal domain (18Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27761-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Moreover TLS is colocalized specifically to spreading initiation center, which exists only in early stages of cell spreading, with ribosomal RNA and other hnRNP complex components (hnRNP K and hnRNP E1) and functionally involved in controlling the rate of cell spreading (19de Hoog C.L. Foster L.J. Mann M. Cell. 2004; 117: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Taken together, TLS appears to be a multifunctional protein responsible for a variety of regulatory processes, including transcription, mRNA splicing, mRNA transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and the initiation of cell spreading. However, despite its physiological importance, little biochemical and structural data about TLS have been available thus far. In the present study, we characterized the tertiary structure of TLS by a combined approach that comprised limited proteolysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS, and CD to identify rigid structural cores and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and NMR spectroscopy for structural and functional characterization. We found that only the RRM and C4 type zinc finger domains fold into the defined core architectures in the isolated TLS protein. The TLS zinc finger domain strongly binds an oligo-RNA, whereas tight interaction of the RRM domain with the RNA was not detected. Furthermore we identified several zinc finger domain residues that contribute to the interaction with RNA. Our present results suggest that other RNA-binding proteins, such as ZNF265, which contains the same type of zinc finger (20Plambeck C.A. Kwan A.H.Y. Adams D.J. Westman B.J. van der Weyden L. Medcalf R.L. Morris B.J. Mackay J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22805-22811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), may also associate with RNAs in a manner similar to that of the TLS zinc finger domain. Expression and Purification of TLS—The human TLS cDNA was cloned into the pGEX6P-1 vector between the BamHI and XhoI sites for expression as an N-terminal GST fusion protein. The DNA fragment encoding residues 171–526 of TLS was also cloned into the vector for an N-terminal truncated mutant protein. In this study, we refer to the TLS full-length fusion protein as GST-TLS-F and the construct containing residues 171–526 of TLS as GST-TLS-C. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) competent cells were transformed with the vectors, and the transformants were grown at 20 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). Protein expression was induced at an A600 = 0.8 by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.15 mm. Then the cells were grown further for 22 h at 20 °C and harvested by centrifugation (6,000 × g for 15 min). The cells were suspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml RNase A, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science) and lysed by sonication (ASTRASON) at 4 °C. The supernatants containing the expressed proteins were clarified by ultracentrifugation (150,000 × g for 30 min), and then the proteins were purified on a GSTrap FF affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). Limited Proteolysis and Fragment Purification—Proteolysis was carried out at 20 °C in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, 3.0 mg/ml GST-TLS-F or GST-TLS-C, and various concentrations of chymotrypsin. After a 20-min incubation, the reaction was quenched by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The reactants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 15–25% gradient gel. For CD measurements, the digestion was carried out on the GSTrap FF columns, and the fragment solution was subjected to HiTrap Benzamidine FF (Amersham Biosciences) to remove the chymotrypsin from the solution followed by a treatment with 2 mm 4-amidinophenylmeth-anesulfonylfluoride to inactivate the remaining protease. Fragments were separated by HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 pg gel filtration chromatography (fast protein liquid chromatography system, Amersham Biosciences) in a buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 300 mm NaCl. Several fragments were further isolated by cation exchange column chromatography (HiTrap SP HP, Amersham Biosciences) in a buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl. Fragments absorbed on the SP column were eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 m NaCl. The protein concentrations were determined by using a colorimetric kit (Protein Assay, Bio-Rad) and also by absorbance at 280 nm (see also Table I). All of the chemicals used were of the highest grade commercially available.Table IN-terminal sequence and MALDI-TOF MS analyses of the major fragments generated by limited proteolysis Data obtained by MALDI-TOF MS for the isolated fragments from GST-TLS-C are indicated.FragmentAssigned residue numberFragment massMolar absorption coefficient ϵObservedCalculatedDaFr1-RRM266-39714,188.914,186.79,530Fr2-RRM266-37512,101.812,101.48,250Fr3-ZnF398-4686,827.46,826.412,900 Open table in a new tab MALDI-TOF MS—Spectra were acquired on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager, Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser, a 20-kV extraction voltage, and a time-delayed extraction. A mixture of saturated 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich) in 33% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix. The GST-TLS-C digestion was stopped by the addition of acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting solution was dried and dissolved in 5 μl of 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The fragment solutions were mixed on a plate with the matrix in a 1:1 ratio and dried at room temperature prior to mass analysis. Insulin chain B and myoglobin were used as external standards for the molecular mass calibration. CD Spectrometry—CD spectra of GST-TLS-F and the fragments were measured on a J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) at 20 °C. Samples (10 μm) were placed in a fused silica cell (1-mm path length), and 25 scans were averaged. Secondary structure contents of GST-TLS-F and the fragments were calculated by the program CONTIN (21Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar) using the CD spectra in the wavelength range of 195–250 nm. N-terminal Sequencing—The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the fragments were determined by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 492 pulsed liquid phase sequencer equipped with an on-line 785A phenylthiohydantoin derivative analyzer. ICP-AES—The zinc content of the TLS zinc finger-like domain (Fr3-ZnF) was determined with an Optima3000 ICP-AES instrument (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at the Advanced Instrumentation Center for Chemical Analysis, Ehime University (22Morita E.H. Ohkubo T. Kuraoka I. Shirakawa M. Tanaka K. Morikawa K. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—E. coli cells harboring a TLS protein expression plasmid were cultured in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl without or with [U-13C]glucose to produce the uniformly 15N- or 15N/13C-labeled protein. The purified protein from a 4-liter culture was concentrated to give 170 μl of 0.1 or 1.8 mm protein solutions containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl in 95% H2O, 5% D2O. A 113Cd-containing sample was prepared by growing the cells in M9 minimal medium containing 10 μm113CdCl2. The sample containing 0.7 mm of the 113Cd-labeled protein was prepared in 99.9% D2O or 95% H2O, 5% D2O buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 100 mm NaCl. The sample solution was packed into a microcell (Shigemi Co. Ltd.) for NMR measurements. Two dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra and a set of three-dimensional triple resonance NMR spectra were acquired at 30 °C on Bruker 750 or 600 MHz NMR spectrometers. To obtain the resonance assignments for the backbone 1H, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′ nuclei, the following spectra were used: HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH (23Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). All data were processed with the program NMRPipe (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). The program PIPP (25Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar) was used to pick peaks for each spectrum. The resultant peak tables were subjected to an in-house, semiautomatic backbone resonance assignment program, JASS (Java script-based graphical backbone resonance assignment tool), 2S. Tatsumoto, K. Satou, and S. Tate, unpublished method. to accelerate the backbone assignment process. The 1H chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulphonic acid (DSS) as 0.0 ppm. Zero frequencies for 13C and 15N chemical shifts were derived from the experimentally obtained 1H frequency for DSS by multiplying by the relative frequencies of 0.251449530 and 0.101329118, respectively (26Markley J.L. Bax A. Arata Y. Hilbers C.W. Kaptein R. Sykes B.D. Wright P.E. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 12: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Chemical shift perturbations according to the RNA titration for the 1H and 15N resonances of the TLS zinc finger fragment were collected from a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra measured on a 750 MHz spectrometer at 30 °C. The molar ratios of RNA to TLS in the titration experiments were set to 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. The 15N-labeled TLS protein concentration was kept at 0.1 mm in all titration experiments. Peak positions were elucidated by using contour simulation in the program PIPP, which calculates the peak position as an average of centers of simulated contour circles for all displayed contour levels (25Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). One-dimensional 113Cd2+ NMR spectra were collected at 30 °C on a Bruker 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with BBO z-axis gradient 1H-BB probes. Molecular Modeling of the TLS Domains—The search for homologous sequences was performed within the Protein Data Bank (27Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27935) Google Scholar) using National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). Sequences were aligned by using the program ClustalW (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) and were amended manually based on the secondary structure prediction results generated by the programs 3D-PSSM (30Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar) and PredictProtein (31Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structural model of the TLS domain (residues 422–453) was built by comparative modeling from the human ZNF265 (Protein Data Bank entry 1NOZ) by using a combination of Swiss-PdbViewer (32Guex N. Peitsch M.C. PDB Q. Newslett. 1996; 77: 7-10Google Scholar) and SWISS-MODEL (33Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). Limited Proteolysis of TLS and Fragment Assignments—A limited proteolytic analysis was carried out to identify the domains with defined architectures and unstructured regions using two purified proteins, GST-TLS-F (full-length TLS fused to GST) and GST-TLS-C (C-terminal TLS fused to GST). Cleavage by chymotrypsin yielded clear bands by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A), whereas the trypsin treatment produced many bands with various sizes (data not shown). The generation of these discrete bands was independent of the chymotrypsin concentration, implying that the bands are derived from protease-resistant fragments (Fig. 1A). The SDS-polyacrylamide gel patterns of the products were similar between the GST-TLS-F and GST-TLS-C digestions, indicating that the chymotrypsin-resistant core regions are located at the C terminus of TLS. To assign these fragments, we fractionated three fragments from GST-TLS-C (Fr1, Fr2, and Fr3 with 14-, 12-, and 8-kDa masses, respectively) that were produced by the on-column cleavage using the GSTrap FF column. The 8-kDa Fr3 fragment was isolated on the gel filtration column, whereas Fr1 and Fr2 were separated by the subsequent cation exchange SP column (Fig. 1B). The 12-kDa Fr2 fragment passed through the column, whereas the absorbed 14-kDa Fr1 was eluted with buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 m NaCl. Next we examined the N-terminal sequences of these three fragments. The analyses revealed that both Fr1 and Fr2 have a GGPRDQG N-terminal sequence, and Fr3 has GGGSGG (Fig. 1C). The molecular masses of these fragments were then measured by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 1C and Table I). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Fr1 and Fr2 contain the RRM domain, while Fr3 bears the zinc finger-like domain. Thus, in agreement with the sequence analysis, we can conclude that only the RRM and zinc finger-like domains form rigid core structures in TLS. The RRM and Zinc Finger-like Domains Exclusively Form Rigid Core Structures in TLS—We measured the CD spectra of the two fragments containing the RRM (Fr2-RRM) and putative zinc finger (Fr3-ZnF) regions (Fig. 2, inset) and the purified GST-TLS-F (Fig. 2) in addition to purified GST alone. The difference spectrum, obtained by subtracting the summed spectra of the other three components from GST-TLS-F itself, exhibited a random coil-like pattern (Fig. 2, broken curve), suggesting that the regions other than the RRM and zinc finger-like domains are unstructured. The calculation of secondary structure contents, using the deconvolution program CONTIN (21Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar), provided 15% α-helix and 25% β-strand for the RRM domain and 5% α-helix and 17% β-strand for the zinc finger-like domain. These values for the RRM domain are essentially consistent with those estimated from the RRM secondary structure prediction (discussed below). In the case of the zinc finger-like domain, the values agree well with those determined by the three-dimensional triple resonance NMR spectrum (discussed below). These results additionally support the proposal that the defined structures in TLS are confined to the RRM and zinc finger-like domains. Structural Characterization of the Zinc Finger-like Domain—We used ICP-AES to analyze the zinc content in Fr3-ZnF, which is actually bound to the zinc finger-like domain, and found that the fragment contains the zinc atom in a 0.7 stoichiometry, which is somewhat lower than the expected value. This could be due to a slightly inaccurate protein concentration and/or zinc content determination. To characterize the coordination scheme of the zinc atom, we next measured the 113Cd2+ NMR spectra of Fr3-ZnF in which the zinc atoms were replaced by cadmium, since 113Cd2+ NMR is the most powerful method to reveal a Zn2+ coordination. First we confirmed that the 113Cd2+-substituted zinc finger domain retains the same main chain folding as the native zinc finger as determined from the 1H-15N HSQC spectra with almost constant chemical shifts (data not shown). The 113Cd2+ one-dimensional NMR spectrum showed a clear peak at 678 ppm (Fig. 3). This 113Cd chemical shift value is consistent with those observed in other tetrahedral tetrathiolate cadmium coordination sites (34Summers M.F. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1988; 86: 43-134Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results prove that the core region, from residues 398 to 468, forms the C4 type zinc finger. Interaction of the RRM and Zinc Finger Domains with RNA—It was reported that the C-terminal half of TLS with the RRM and zinc finger domains binds RNA containing a preferred RNA sequence (GGUG) with a submicromolar order dissociation constant (17Lerga A.

The RRM and the RGG repeats were also considered to be responsible for RNA binding. On the other hand, the ZNF265 zinc finger domain, which shares sequence similarity with the TLS zinc finger, can bind mRNA (20Plambeck C.A. Kwan A.H.Y. Adams D.J. Westman B.J. van der Weyden L.

Therefore, it has remained unclear whether either or both domains are responsible for RNA binding in TLS. Thus, we attempted to clarify which domain is more important for the binding of an RNA oligomer (5′-UAGUUUGGUGAU-3′) using a backbone amide NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis (Fig. 4, A and B). Upon the titration of 15N-labeled Fr2-RRM with 0–2 equimolar amounts of the unlabeled RNA, no significant spectral changes were observed in the RRM, indicating that a tight interaction does not occur between the RRM and the GGUG-containing RNA. A series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled Fr3-ZnF were also collected upon titration from 0 to 2 equimolar amounts of RNA. In contrast to the results with RRM, 23 of the 25 signals from the amide residues in the zinc finger domain showed remarkable chemical shift changes or broadening (Fig. 4B). Most of the NMR signals displayed in Fig. 4B are derived from the structured zinc finger domain because the residues from unstructured G-rich portions yield broadened signals under these conditions. We assigned the backbone resonances from all of the residues in the zinc finger region, including amide 1H, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and carbonyl carbon, although Asn-442 was not assigned due to the severe overlap of its 1H-15N correlation signal with unassigned signals derived from residues outside of the zinc finger domain (see Supplemental Data). The signals are shown in the spectrum with their assigned residue numbers in Fig. 4B. The assigned backbone 13C chemical shifts predict that the zinc finger consists of two β-strands and one α-helix (35Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). This result is essentially consistent with the homology model from the alignment between the TLS and ZNF265 sequences. Fig. 4C shows the weighted chemical shift differences, which were observed for the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the zinc finger domain measured with and without the RNA. The two β-strand regions showed larger chemical shift differences or broadenings over the remaining part in the zinc finger domain. It should be noted that all of the signals that were altered by RNA binding were derived from the residues in the zinc finger domain. The two unassigned signals in the spectrum shown in Fig. 4B, resonating around the spectral coordinates of 9.5 ppm (1H), 131 ppm (15N) and 10.1 ppm (1H), 131 ppm (15N) were assumed to come from the NHϵ groups of two Trp side chains, which are exclusive to the zinc finger portion of the Fr3-ZnF fragment. From the chemical shift changes of all of the perturbed amino acid residues, the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of the TLS zinc finger domain for RNA binding was estimated to be about 1.0 × 10-5m. A National Center for Biotechnology Information Conserved Domain Database search of the human TLS sequence implied that the relative domain arrangements of the RRM and zinc finger might be evolutionally conserved from yeast to human with the restricted lengths of the intervening sequence between the domains.

Rapid influx of Ca2+ through the Cav1.2 channels initiates physiological responses like gene expression, neurotransmitter release, cardiac or smooth muscle contraction, and regulation of Ca2+-dependent ion channels (1Deisseroth K.

Spotts J.M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2001; 294: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). In these capacities, the functional profile of Cav1.2 calcium channels can be customized by combinatorial assembly of the Cav1.2 α1 with several different auxiliary β- and α2δ-subunits (5Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). Even greater flexibility in functional tuning could arise from alternative splicing of the α1-subunit genes (6Lipscombe D. Pan J.Q. Gray A.C. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 26: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); splicing of the human α11.2 subunit gene is known to generate variants with tissue-specific biases and with distinct pharmacological properties (7Welling A. Ludwig A. Zimmer S. Klugbauer N. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). At present, 15 of 53 known exons (Fig. 1) of the human α11.2 gene have been reported to be subjected to alternative splicing (8Abernethy D.R. Soldatov N.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the full set of possible splice loci and variations and their distributions in heart and brain could far exceed this initial view. Recently, genome-wide analyses suggest that as high as 74% of human genes are alternatively spliced (9Johnson J.M. Castle J. Garrett-Engele P. Kan Z. Loerch P.M. Armour C.D. Santos R. Schadt E.E. Stoughton R. Shoemaker D.D. Science. 2003; 302: 2141-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA has been implicated in development, physiology, and pathophysiology, and the inclusion or exclusion of exons can be regulated in a tissue-specific or temporal manner (10Xu Q. Modrek B. Lee C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3754-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 11Bell T.J. Thaler C. Castiglioni A.J. Helton T.D. Lipscombe D. Neuron. 2004; 41: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Splice variations of human α11.2 subunit confer on the channel isoforms altered properties such as sensitivity to blockade by antagonists, regulation by protein kinase, current density, and activation and inactivation characteristics (12Blumenstein Y.

Pfluegers Arch. 2000; 440: 50-60PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies have reported generally on the impact of alternative splicing on Cav1.2 channel functions by characterizing limited numbers of cDNA clones isolated from a single library. We decided to employ the transcript scanning method (15Mittman S. Guo J. Agnew W.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 274: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to search systemically for the full suite of alternatively spliced exons of the human α11.2 subunit. Four human cDNA libraries (fetal and adult brain and heart cDNA libraries) were investigated to determine tissue or developmental regulation of the utilization of splice exons. In this study, we have discovered novel splice exons and have uncovered extensive splice variations especially in the IVS3 and IVS3-S4 linker region. To illustrate functional diversity generated by alternative splicing of the α11.2 subunit, we performed electrophysiological recordings of the IVS3-S4 splice variants for the following reasons. (i) The IVS3-S4 region is subjected to extensive splicing. (ii) The addition of just two amino acids in the same linker region in the Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 channels showed altered biophysical and pharmacological properties (16Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Sutton K.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). (iii) The equivalent region was suggested to form part of the voltage-sensor paddle in the potassium channel, KvAP (18Jiang Y. Ruta V. Chen J. Lee A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 19Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the Cav1.2 splice variations at the IVS3-S4 region generated a range of current-voltage relationships and voltage-dependent activation characteristics that correlated with the linker length. Transcript Scanning by PCR—The transcript scanning method has been described in detail by Mittman et al. (15Mittman S. Guo J. Agnew W.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 274: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Soong et al. (20Soong T.W. DeMaria C.D. Alvania R.S. Zweifel L.S. Liang M.C. Mittman S. Agnew W.S. Yue D.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10142-10152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the systematic identification of loci for alternative splicing of the following voltage-gated calcium channel genes: CACNA1I, CACNA1G, and CACNA1A. Here we briefly describe the method. Pairs of primers were used to amplify 20 amplicons covering overlapping regions of the entire Cav1.2 α1-subunit. The size of the PCR products ranged from 360 to 670 bp, spanning between 1 and 5 exons. We used 2–5 lots of fetal and adult brain and fetal and adult heart human cDNA libraries (Quickclone cDNA, catalog numbers 7129-1, 7187-1, 7168-1, and 7121-1; and Marathon-Ready™ cDNA, catalog numbers 7402-1, 7400-1, and 7404-1, Clontech; fetal heart cDNA, catalog number D8864-01, Gene Pool™, Invitrogen) for the transcript scanning reactions. Details of the method are found in the Supplemental Material or in Soong et al. (20Soong T.W. DeMaria C.D. Alvania R.S. Zweifel L.S. Liang M.C. Mittman S. Agnew W.S. Yue D.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10142-10152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Distribution of IVS3-S4 Splice Variations by Nested PCR—Flanking primers were employed for PCR across exons 28–37 (primers 23 and 28; supplemental Table S1) or across exons 30–35 (primers 25 and 26; supplemental Table S1) of the human Cav1.2 α1-subunit from fetal and adult brain and heart cDNA libraries. The amplicons were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and transformed into DH10B Escherichia coli cells. About 280 colonies from each group were picked as templates in a second nested PCR by using exon 31-specific forward primer (5′-CAGCATAATTGACGTCATTC-3′) or exon 32-specific forward primer (5′-TGTTGATATAGCAATCACC-3′) and a common reverse primer (5′-CTTCACCAGACGCATGAC-3′). cDNA fragments of the five splice combinations (+31, –32, and +33); (–31, +32, and +33); (–31, +32, and –33); (–31, +32-6 nt, 1The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotide; aa, amino acid; ANOVA, analysis of variance; WT, wild type. and +33), and (–31, +32-6 nt, and –33) were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and used as controls for the colony PCR screening experiments. The different splice combinations were differentiated based on their distinct migration patterns in 4–5% agarose gels. To verify the accuracy of the gel analysis, plasmids extracted from representative colonies were sent for DNA sequencing. Construction of Full-length Human Cav1.2 Splice Variants—The parental full-length human Cav1.2 α1-subunit (α1C77WT) in pBluescript vector was kindly provided by Dr. R. D. Zuhlke (Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, Switzerland). The exon combination of α1C77WT is as follows: 1–20, 22–30, 32–44, and 46–50 (21Soldatov N.M. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10540-10543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). PCR fragments containing variation A (–31, 32-6 nt, and –33), variation B (–31, 32-6 nt, and +33), and variation C (–31, +32, and –33) were amplified from an adult heart cDNA library using primers 23 and 28 (supplemental Table S1), whereas variation D (+31, –32, and +33) was amplified from a fetal heart cDNA library. The four splice variations were substituted into α1C77WT (–31, +32, and +33) in pBluescript by using the restriction enzymes BclI and BstBI. The various full-length human Cav1.2 containing splice combinations of the IVS3-IVS4 region were subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vector by using restriction enzymes HindIII and XbaI. The human Cav1.2 splice variant clones were named α1C77-A (–31, +32-6 nt, and –33), -B (–31, +32-6 nt, and +33), -C (–31, +32, and –33), and -D (+31, –32, and +33). The identities of all the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient Expression of Human Cav1.2 Splice Variants in HEK293 Cells—In a 35-mm Petri dish, 1.65 μgof α11.2 cDNA clone (α1C77WT or its variants) together with 1.25 μgofrat β2a, 1.25 μgof α2bδ (23McRory J.E. Hamid J. Doering C.J. Garcia E. Parker R. Hamming K. Chen L. Hildebrand M. Beedle A.M. Feldcamp L. Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1707-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and 0.2 μg of T-antigen were co-transfected into HEK293 cells by the calcium phosphate method (24Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The cells were grown for 36–48 h in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C before whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Whole-cell Ba2+ Current Recordings in HEK293 Cells—Whole-cell patch clamp recordings (pClamp8.1, Axon Instruments) were employed to characterize α1C77WT and its splice variants. The bath solution contained (in mm) the following: tetraethylammonium methanesulfonate, 140; HEPES, 10; BaCl2, 5 (pH 7.3, adjusted with CsOH). The internal solution contained (in mm) the following: Cs-MeSO3, 138; CsCl, 5; EGTA, 0.5; MgCl2, 1; MgATP, 4 and HEPES, 10 (pH 7.3, adjusted with CsOH). The solution osmolarities were adjusted to 290–300 mOsm with glucose. The reported voltages are uncorrected for a –11-mV junction potential, and true voltage may be obtained by subtracting 11 mV from the reported values. Whole-cell currents, obtained under voltage clamp with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments), were filtered at 1–5 kHz and sampled at 5-50 kHz. Series resistance was typically <5 megohms after >70% compensation. Leak and capacitive transients were subtracted on-line by using the P/4 protocol. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed by using Microsoft Excel and Graphpad Prism IV software (San Diego) and were displayed as mean values ± S.E. Current-voltage relationship, steady-state activation and steady-state inactivation were analyzed by the following equations, with parameters determined using least squares criteria. The I-V curves were fitted by IBa = Gmax(V – Erev)/{1 + exp((V – V ½)/kI-V)}, where Gmax is maximum conductance; Erev is reversal potential; V ½ is voltage at 50% of IBa activation; kI-V is slope factor; and n is the number of tested cells. Activation data were fitted by a dual Boltzmann function of the following form: G/Gmax = Flow/{1 + exp((V ½,low – V)/klow)} + (1 – Flow)/{1 + exp((V ½,high –V)/khigh)}, where G is the tail current; Gmax is the tail current evoked by a depolarization to +120 mV; Flow is the fraction of the low threshold component; V is the membrane potential of the test pulse; V ½,low, V ½,high, klow, and khigh are the half-activation potentials and slope factors for the low and high threshold components, respectively (25Takahashi S.X. Mittman S. Colecraft H.M. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3007-3021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and V ½ act is the potential for half-activation calculated from dual Boltzmann functions when G = 0.5Gmax. Steady-state inactivation data were fitted by a Boltzmann function of the form: h(15 s) = I2/I1 = (A1 – A2)/{1 + exp((V – V ½ inact)/k)}+A2, where I2 is the test pulse current; I1 is the normalization current; A1 is initial current amplitude; A2 is final current amplitude; V is the membrane potential of the conditioning pulse; V ½ inact is the potential for half-inactivation; and k is the slope factor. Rapid Method to Assess Extent of Splice Variation by Transcript Scanning—Fig. 1A is a diagrammatic representation of the human Cav1.2 channel, which consists of four domains comprising 24 transmembrane segments (vertical barrels) connected by intervening cytoplasmic loops represented as horizontal bars. We performed overlapping multiple PCRs covering all exons, except the bracketing exons, of the human α11.2 subunit transcript (Fig. 1B) to rapidly yield a complex picture in which 19 of 55 exons were subjected to alternative splicing. The total number of exons in the α11.2 subunit reported here is an increase of two novel exons to add to the 53 exons already reported elsewhere (Fig. 1). The method (Fig. 1B) required PCR amplifications across 1–5 exons producing products of 360–670 bp in size. Careful analyses by DNA sequencing of the PCR products and examination of all exon-exon junctions revealed all possible splicing loci of the human α11.2 subunit in a given tissue. Fig. 1C is an example in which amplicon 30–35, subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector and screened by colony PCR, demonstrates splice variations at the IVS3-S4 region when analyzed by electrophoresis in 5% agarose gel. DNA sequencing confirmed the combinatorial identities of 4 of the possible 12 splice combinations. The entire 12 IVS3-S4 splicing permutations are generated by the inclusion or exclusion of exons 32, 32-6 nt, and 33 (six combinations), exons 31 and 33 (four combinations), and combinations of either (+31, +32, and +33) or (+31, +32-6 nt, and +33). We found all the IVS3-S4 splice variations by screening human fetal and adult heart and brain cDNA libraries (Table I).Table ILoci of splice variations of Cav1.2 α1-subunit distributed in human heart and brain Open table in a new tab Novel and Extensive Splice Variations Revealed by Transcript Scanning—Fig. 2 illustrates the distribution of splice sites across the entire length of the human Cav1.2 message. Four pairs of exons are by and large spliced in a mutually exclusive manner: 1/1a, 8/8a, 21/22, and 31/32. Six exons including 9, 9*, 10*, 33, 45, and 45* are alternatively spliced, whereas seven other exons are spliced at the alternate junctions namely 3, 7, 15, 17, 32, 41, and 45* (Table I, also see supplemental Figs. A and B for the detailed splicing patterns). Exons 32 and 45* are unique as they could be spliced either as alternate exons or at alternate donor sites. Junctional splicing at the acceptor site of exon 17 could either produce an insertion of a 9-nucleotide (9-nt) sequence (... ACTGGCCAG...) without disrupting the reading frame or an insertion of 12 nt (... CTGACTGGCCAG...) giving rise to an in-frame TGA stop codon immediately 3′ of exon 16. The 12-nt insertion might produce a two-domain hemichannel as exon 16 resides on the II-III loop of α11.2 subunit. Exons 9* and 10* are novel and have not been described for the human α11.2 subunit transcript in the literature, whereas exons 3 and 9 have not been reported to be subjected to alternative splicing. Exon 9* is a 75-nt insert between exons 9 and 10, whereas exon 10* adds 120 nt to the mRNA between exons 10 and 11 in the I-II loop of the channel (GenBank™ accession numbers AY562395 for 9* and AY562396 for 10*). It is notable that 10* was not annotated as a potential exon in the data base but was detected by transcript scanning in 1 of 8 clones of amplicons 8–11 that were sequenced. Essentially, the canonical splice sites and a pyrimidine tract flanking 10* confirm it as an exon. Predictably, a number of splicing events would produce nonfunctional channels as follows: insertion of 4 nt at the 5′ end of exon 3; deletion of 73 nt in 15; deletion of both 8 and 8a or 8, 8a, and 9; deletion of both 21 and 22; and the deletion or inclusion of both 31 and 32 (Table I and supplemental Figs. A and B). The 4-nt insertion into the 5′ end of exon 3 shifts the reading frame of the α11.2 transcript. This would give rise to a premature stop with the production of only the N terminus of the α11.2 subunit, and it would be interesting to determine whether this short cytoplasmic fragment may play any dominant-negative regulatory role. What is also intriguing was the large number of splice variations detected in the IVS3-S4 region where we identified all 12 combinations derived from random inclusion or exclusion of 31/32, or 32-6 nt, and 33. The transcript scanning method was unable to detect splicing of the first or last exon as the method requires flanking exons for the design of PCR primers. However, exon 1a has been reported in human, rabbit, and rat (12Blumenstein Y. Kanevsky N. Sahar G. Barzilai R. Ivanina T. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3419-3423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S.

By using 1a-specific primers (primers 1 and 2, see supplemental Table S1), we were able to detect exon 1a expression in the human heart but not in the aorta or brain (Fig. 3A). In all our scanning, we have been unsuccessful in detecting exon 45 in human heart or brain, but we found that exon 45 was expressed at a high level in the human fibroblast cell line Mrc5 (Fig. 3B). This observation agreed with the report of exon 45 detected in human fetal skin fibroblast cell line CRL 1475 (28Soldatov N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4628-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Instead, we detected exon 45* in the human heart and brain cDNAs but not in fibroblast. We were also unable to detect the splice profile of the hippocampal cDNA clone h54 engineered into α1C,86 (29Soldatov N.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which included the deletion of 17 nt from 3′ end of exon 40 (40A), exon 40B, and the addition of 132 nt at the 5′ end and 30 nt at the 3′ end of exon 43 (43A). However, such a cDNA clone might have been constructed from incompletely spliced nuclear pre-mRNA (13Soldatov N.M. Zuhlke R.D. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3560-3566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Transcript scanning has revealed 40 splice variations in the human α11.2 subunit transcript, and of these we discovered 16 novel variations (Table I and supplemental Figs. A and B). Two of these 16 novel splice variations have been reported in other species. Exon 9* was found in rabbit lung, mouse brain, and a rat smooth muscle cell line A7R5 (30Biel M. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hullin R. Stuhmer W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 31Bielefeldt K. J. Lab. Clin.

Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Inspection of the CACNA1C gene (NT_009759, gi:29805200) published in the GenBank™ data base demonstrated the use of the canonical GU-AG (34Sharp P.A. Burge C.B.

One exception is the splicing between the invariant exons 2 and 3, which do not follow the GU-AG or AU-AC rule (34Sharp P.A. Burge C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 875-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), but employed the AU-AG splice donor and acceptor sites. The other three exceptions are the insertion of 4 nt into exon 3 which employed the unconventional AU-UC splice sites, whereas the insertion of either 9 or 12 nt into exon 17 used the unconventional GU-UG splice sites. Altogether, we have identified 12 loci, 19 splice exons, and 40 splice variations in the human α11.2 subunit. This report therefore provides a comprehensive examination of all splice loci and splice combinations to highlight the rich repertoire of genetic variations in the human Cav1.2 channel. In-depth Analysis of Predominant Splice Combinations in IVS3-S4 —Transcript scanning provided a quick glimpse of the possible splicing events for most of the exons in the α11.2 message. Because of the numerous PCRs performed on four cDNA libraries as templates, we could only screen a limited number of bacterial colonies (8–32 colonies) and sequenced a small number of PCR products showing different sizes (2–4 clones). It is conceivable that we might not detect low abundant splice exons expressed in different tissues or developmental stages. The data in Table I show the splice exons we detected in two types of tissues but do not define any proportions of spatial or temporal distributions. To generate such profiles, a more vigorous investigation of the distribution of splice variations was conducted for the IVS3 and IVS3-S4 linker region that are encoded by exons 31, 32, and 33 (33Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 35Perez-Reyes E. Wei X.Y. Castellano A. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20430-20436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We decided to investigate the functional diversity in this region because inclusion or exclusion of a dipeptide in the same region in Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 channels produced altered biophysical and pharmacological characteristics (16Bourinet E.

Pan J.Q. Beierlein M. Lipscombe D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5322-5331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two colony libraries containing either PCR products of amplicon 30–35 (∼500 bp) or amplicon 28–37 (∼1240 bp) were generated and assessed to exclude the possibility of preferential PCR of one splice combination over another. Here more than 280 bacterial colonies of each recombinant cDNA library containing the IVS3-S4 region were screened for the usage of exons 31, 32 (32-6 nt), and 33. Both libraries provided corroborating results on the distribution of the IVS3-S4 splice variants in the cDNAs examined. Of the 12 splice combinations, at least 5 were predicted to form functional channels (Fig. 4A and Table I). Detailed analysis of the colony PCR screens indicated that the predominant splice combination for the fetal heart and the fetal and adult brain at the IVS3-S4 region was WT (–31, +32, and +33). This splice combination represented between 59 and 66% of the clones screened (Fig. 4B). There were, however, two co-dominant isoforms in the adult heart that included 39% of WT (–31, +32, and +33) and 31% of variation C (–31, +32, and –33). Whereas on the other extreme, variation A (–31, +32-6 nt, and –33) was detected at low levels representing between 1% in adult brain to 7% in adult heart. Variation B (–31, +32-6 nt, and +33) was expressed at a more even level between 11 and 16% in all the cDNA libraries. The 3-fold increase in variation C (–31, +32, –33) of adult (31%) over fetal (10%) heart could have arisen by developmental regulation of exon 33 (Fig. 4B and supplemental Table S2). Most interestingly, there is a 10-fold lower expression of variation C in adult brain when compared with adult heart pointing to a tissue or physiological difference in expression (supplemental Table S2). A puzzling observation is that ∼2–5% of the clones screened either include or exclude the pair of mutually exclusive exons 31/32 that will likely generate nonfunctional channels (Table I and supplemental Fig. B). The strict rule of mutual exclusivity in the inclusion or exclusion of either 31 or 32 did not apply to the α11.2 subunit transcript. Nonetheless, the combination +31 and –32 was represented between 8 and 16%, whereas the combination –31 and +32 ranged from 82 to 88% of the clones examined. Alternative Splicing Generated Electrophysiological Differences in Cav1.2 Variants—The reference Cav1.2 channel, α1C77WT, that contained the predominant IVS3-S4 splice variation is designated the wild type (WT) clone (21Soldatov N.M.

Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Wholecell IBa was measured to compare the current-voltage (I-V) relationships between the WT and the four splice variants α1C77-A, -B, -C, and -D (Table II). The V½ for the α1C77WT was –9.3 ± 1.28 mV (n = 8), and three splice variants (α1C77-A, -B, and -C) containing exon 32 and a shorter IVS3-S4 linker region demonstrated a shift in the I-V curve into the hyperpolarized direction. Approximate fits of the I-V relationships hinted at differences in the voltage dependence of activation, with the half-point of voltage activation for single Boltzmann terms (V½) yielding significant differences. The I-V curve of variant α1C77-A shifted –9.5 mV (–18.8 ± 0.97 mV, n = 11), α1C77-B shifted –4.9 mV (–14.2 ± 0.60 mV, n = 16), and α1C77-C shifted –6.8 mV (–16.1 ± 0.86 mV, n = 16) to the left (Fig. 5). Nonetheless, the difference between the V½ for the WT and α1C77-D was not statistically significant. The reversal potentials for all the channel splice variants were similar.Table IIParameters of current-voltage relationships of α1C77WT and splice variantsSplice variantsErevV½kI-VnmVα1C77WT48.0 ± 1.13-9.3 ± 1.28-5.99 ± 0.328α1C77-A46.3 ± 0.72-18.8 ± 0.97ap < 0.05 compared with the α1C"
https://openalex.org/W2088617756,"We hypothesized that key antiproliferative target genes for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) were repressed by an epigenetic mechanism in prostate cancer cells resulting in apparent hormonal insensitivity. To explore this possibility, we examined nuclear receptor corepressor expression in a panel of nonmalignant and malignant cell lines and primary cultures, and found frequently elevated SMRT corepressor mRNA expression often associated with reduced sensitivity to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1alpha,25(OH)2D3). For example, PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines had 1.8-fold and twofold increases in SMRT mRNA relative to normal PrEC cells (P<0.05). Similarly, 10/15 primary tumour cultures (including three matched to normal cells from the same donors) had elevated SMRT mRNA levels; generally NCoR1 and Alien were not as commonly elevated. Corepressor proteins often have associated histone deacetylases (HDAC) and reflectively the antiproliferative action of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 can be 'restored' by cotreatment with low doses of HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA, 15 nM) to induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. To decipher the transcriptional events that lead to these cellular responses, we undertook gene expression studies in PC-3 cells after cotreatment of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 plus TSA after 6 h. Examination of known VDR target genes and cDNA microarray analyses revealed cotreatment of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 plus TSA cooperatively upregulated eight (out of 1176) genes, including MAPK-APK2 and GADD45alpha. MRNA and protein time courses and inhibitor studies confirmed these patterns of regulation. Subsequently, we knocked down SMRT levels in PC-3 cells using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach and found that GADD45alpha induction by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 alone became very significantly enhanced. The same distortion of gene responsiveness, with repressed induction of GADD45alpha was found in primary tumour cultures compared and to matched peripheral zone (normal) cultures from the same donor. These data demonstrate that elevated SMRT levels are common in prostate cancer cells, resulting in suppression of target genes associated with antiproliferative action and apparent 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-insensitivity. This can be targeted therapeutically by combination treatments with HDAC inhibitors."

However, the demonstration of growth restricted to the c-axis suggests a specific protein-crystal interaction, and the charged COOH terminus is often implicated in this function.

Amelogenin knock-out mice experience improper enamel formation, and genetic mutations of amelogenin also result in enamel defects, establishing the importance of amelogenin in enamel formation (3Fincham A.G.

Despite its importance, mechanisms at the molecular level directing amelogenins control of enamel crystallites are not understood. It is known that under physiological conditions, amelogenin self-assembles into nanospheres of ∼20 nm in diameter, consisting of multiple monomers, and this is believed to be its functional form (5Fincham A.G.

Transmission electron microscope studies have shown that the amelogenin nanospheres align in beaded rows along the c-axis of the developing enamel crystal (5Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J.

This suggests a specific matrix-crystal interaction, yet the region of the protein interacting with HAP to result in the observed crystal regulation has not been identified. It has been postulated, based on experimental evidence, that both the charged NH2 and COOH terminus of amelogenin are exposed on the surface of the nanospheres (6Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J.

Tan J. Fincham A.G. Biopolymers. 1998; 46: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These hypotheses are supported by in vitro experiments, reviewed recently by Moradian-Oldak (13Moradian-Oldak J. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), demonstrating the effect of amelogenins on growing calcium phosphate crystals. Experiments by both Aoba et al. (14Aoba T. Fukae M. Tanabe T. Shimizu M. Moreno E.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1987; 41: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and Moradian-Oldak et al. (15Moradian-Oldak J. Bouropoulos N. Wang L. Gharakhanian N. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the loss of the charged carboxyl terminus during proteolytic processing of amelogenin results in reduced affinity to hydroxyapatite and a reduction in ability to inhibit crystal growth. These observations provide some evidence that the COOH terminus is important in the interaction of amelogenin with the calcium phosphate crystal but do not rule out other contributions such as structural change or altered protein-protein interactions. Direct evidence indicating that the COOH terminus is closely interacting with HAP has not yet been presented. Due to alternative splicing and proteolysis, amelogenins range in size from 5 to 27 kDa (3Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Simmer J.P. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 136: 270-299Crossref Scopus (489) Google Scholar). A 59-residue amelogenin, LRAP (leucine-rich amelogenin protein), is the naturally occurring result of alternative splicing of the primary transcript (16Gibson C.W. Golub E. Ding W. Shimokawa H. Young M. Termine J. Rosenbloom J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and consists of the first 33 and the last 26 residues of full-length amelogenin. The two segments have been linked to function during biomineralization as they consist of the regions in full-length amelogenin that are found to be almost entirely conserved (Table I) across all species studied (3Fincham A.G.

Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), although its specific role in enamel formation has not been determined. Due to its biological relevance and amenable size for selective isotope incorporation, the LRAP protein was chosen for initial investigation of amelogenin orientation on the hydroxyapatite surface. The solid state NMR (SSNMR) dipolar recoupling technique, REDOR (rotational echo double resonance) (19Gullion T. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 81: 196-200Crossref Scopus (1536) Google Scholar) was used to examine the important amino acids in the LRAP-HAP interaction. A single 13C isotopic label was incorporated into the side chain methyl group of the alanine at position 46 (Ala46), contained within the charged region of the COOH terminus. The orientation of this protein, LRAP-A, on the HAP surface was determined by measuring the distance from the incorporated 13C label in the protein to the surface phosphate groups (13C-labeled Ala46-31P). A second labeled protein, LRAP-A*, was synthesized without phosphorylation to remove dipolar coupling contributions not resulting from interactions with HAP. The study of the orientation of this region of LRAP provides new insight into the interaction of amelogenin with the surface of HAP.Table IThe sequences of bovine LRAP (59 residues) investigated in this workLRAP-AMPLPPHPGHPGYINFpSYEVLTPLKWYQSMIRHP PLPPMLPDLPLEAWPATDKTKREEVDLRAP-A*MPLPPHPGHPGYINF SYEVLTPLKWYQSMIRHP PLPPMLPDLPLEAWPATDKTKREEVDBovineMPLPPHPGHPGYINFpSYEVLTPLKWYQSMIRHP# PLPPMLPDLPLEAWPATDKTKREEVDHumanMPLPPHPGHPGYINFpSYEVLTPLKWYQSMIRPP..PLPPILPDLHLEAWPATDKTKREEVDMouseMPLPPHPGSPGYINLpSYEVLTPLKWYQSMIRQP..PLSPILPELPLEAWPATDKTKREEVDPigMPLPPHPGHPGYINFpSYEVLTPLKWYQNMIRHP.....SLLPDLPLEAWPATDKTKREEVD Open table in a new tab Peptides were synthesized by United Biochemical Research, Inc., Seattle, WA. Purity and identity were established with high performance liquid chromatography and electrospray mass spectrometry, giving a mass of 6927 for LRAP-A and 6848 for LRAP-A*. Off Surface—Samples for measurements off the surface were prepared by dissolving 30–60 mg of LRAP protein into 1–2 ml of buffer solution (0.15 m NaCl saturated with respect to HAP), diluting to 20 ml with Millipore® water, adjusting to pH 7.4, and lyophilizing. On Surface—Samples bound to hydroxyapatite were prepared by dissolving 50 mg of LRAP protein into 150 ml buffer and adjusting to pH 7.4. 150 mg of HAP was added to the protein solution. The protein was bound for 1 h, after which the mixture was centrifuged and washed one to three times with buffer. For hydrated samples, the sample was then packed into a rotor for NMR analysis. For analysis under lyophilized conditions, the sample was lyophilized prior to being packed into the rotor. All NMR experiments were performed on a Chemagnetics Infinity console at 300 MHz proton frequency with a Chemagnetics triply resonant, variable temperature probe. REDOR (19Gullion T. Schaefer J. J.

A 6-μs 90° 1H pulse and a 0.75-ms mixing time were used for crosspolarization, with a decoupling field of ∼65 kHz and two-pulse phase modulation (TPPM) decoupling (21Bennett A. Rienstra C. Auger M.

Amelogenins have been proposed to nucleate and regulate crystal growth, but some (1Simmer J.P. Fincham A.G. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 84-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 23Hunter G.K. Curtis H.A. Grynpas M.D. Simmer J.P. Fincham A.G. Calcif.

The formation of nanospheres are found to be crucial to the regulatory function of amelogenin, possibly creating a hydrophobic core and leaving charged residues found in the NH2 and COOH termini covering the surface of the sphere (6Fincham A.G.

This organization within the nanosphere would optimize charged interactions between the protein and hydroxyapatite and has been suggested based on the results of several studies (9Paine M.L. Snead M.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Moradian-Oldak J. Leung W. Fincham A.G. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Consistent with the placement of the COOH terminus on the surface of the nanospheres, experimental studies have also shown that removal of the COOH terminus reduces the ability of the protein to interact with HAP (14Aoba T. Fukae M. Tanabe T. Shimizu M. Moreno E.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1987; 41: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 15Moradian-Oldak J. Bouropoulos N. Wang L. Gharakhanian N. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although very promising, these studies do not rule out other contributions such as protein-protein interactions or structural changes playing a key role in the change in interaction mechanism. This study provides direct evidence placing the COOH terminus close enough to the HAP surface to allow interaction that could influence the habit of the inorganic phase.

Langmuir. 2001; 17: 5059-5065Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Gougeon W. Reinholdt M. Delmotte L. Miehe-Brendle J. Chezeau J. Dred R.L. Marchal R. Jeandet P. Langmuir. 2002; 18: 3396-3398Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SSNMR techniques are further applied here to provide site-specific interactions between the amelogenin, LRAP, and hydroxyapatite. Determining the distance from a specific residue in the protein to the HAP surface yields a direct measure of the orientation of that region of the protein with respect to the HAP surface, providing insight into the importance of the selected region of the protein in interacting with the enamel surface. Fig. 1 shows the REDOR dephasing curve for LRAP-A off the surface, lyophilized from PBS solution. The complete lack of dephasing indicates that there are no phosphate groups within 10 Å, the longest distance that can be accurately measured for the 13C-31P nuclei, as determined by simulations and dipolar coupling values. This result is expected for the unbound peptide and also demonstrates that the tertiary folding of the protein does not bring the Ser16(P) near in space to Ala46 (Fig. 2A). Fig. 1 also shows the REDOR dephasing curve for LRAP-A bound to hydroxyapatite both hydrated and lyophilized. There is an obvious increased dephasing in the experimental data for both preparations, showing definitively that Ala46 is closely interacting with a phosphorus group. Experimental data for the lyophilized, surface-bound protein is best simulated by a distance of 7.0 Å between the 13C and the nearby 31P. For the hydrated sample, the distance is somewhat longer at 8.0 Å, indicating a slight modification in interaction due to the presence of water. Assuming there is no structural change in the protein upon binding, this NMR data demonstrates that the 13C methyl-labeled alanine is near the hydroxyapatite surface, providing compelling evidence that the charged residues of the COOH terminus are interacting with the HAP surface (Fig. 2).Fig. 2A cartoon depicting the protein-crystal interaction determined by SSNMR and confirmed with neutron reflectometry experiments.A, the LRAP protein in solution with the COOH and NH2 termini indicated (the folding depicted is shown purely for illustrative purposes, but experiments confirm that Ser16(P) is removed in space from the COOH terminus). B, the LRAP protein bound to the hydroxyapatite surface, indicating the proximity of the charged COOH-terminal region to the hydroxyapatite surface. The COOH region is expanded in C, which indicates the 13C methyl side chain on Ala46 and it's proximity to a 31P in the surface of hydroxyapatite.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above data conclusively demonstrate that Ala46 is nearby to a 31P group only when it is bound to the surface, indicating that the local environment at Ala46 is altered during the binding process. Attributing the nearby 31P group to the surface phosphate groups (Fig. 2, B and C) without further investigation would be reasonable in the absence of any other 31P group, but previous inspection of the primary structure revealed a phosphoserine (Ser(P)) in the protein at position 16. While this phosphorus is not close to Ala46 in the sample lyophilized from solution (as seen by the lack of dephasing in Fig. 1), the possibility of refolding on the surface, or intermolecular interactions bringing these two residues in close proximity, does need to be taken into account due to the sensitivity of REDOR to any nearby 31P. Thus, due to the presence of this phosphoserine residue, further experiments were employed to clarify the source of the 31P resulting in dephasing. The possible interactions involved, including surface-induced protein refolding or intermolecular interactions, as well as identifying residues interacting with the HAP surface, are all fundamental mechanisms that have not been explored experimentally. Identifying any of these mechanisms will greatly enhance our understanding of the developing biomineral interface. Orientation of LRAP-A* on HAP—To ascertain whether a structural change or protein-crystal interaction results in the introduction of a nearby 31P at Ala46 upon binding to HAP, an unphosphorylated protein was prepared, LRAP-A*, replacing Ser16(P) with Ser16. Interestingly, this phosphorylation has not been seen to affect the quaternary folding ability of full-length amelogenin (5Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Diekwisch T.G.H. Lyaruu D.M.

Additionally, the majority of calcium phosphate interaction studies have been undertaken with unphosphorylated rM179 (13Moradian-Oldak J. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and HAP interactions are indistinguishable when compared with tissue derived amelogenin (31Simmer J.P. Lau E.C. Hu C.C. Aoba T. Lacey M. Nelson D. Zeichner-David M. Snead M.L. Slavkin H.C. Fincham A.G. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1994; 54: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) suggesting that this phosphoserine group may not play a critical role in HAP interactions. The REDOR results for LRAP-A* were identical to results for the phosphorylated protein, LRAP-A. Specifically, LRAP-A* off the surface showed no dephasing, as expected due to the lack of 31P in the protein and the lack of the hydroxyapatite surface. Under hydrated conditions, LRAP-A* bound to the surface had a measured distance of 8.0 Å, indistinguishable from the dephasing observed for the phosphorylated protein, LRAP-A (Fig. 1). The combined data demonstrate that a secondary or quaternary structural change is not responsible for the observed dephasing. Consequently, the data are compatible only with the interpretation that the COOH terminus of the protein is in close proximity with the calcium phosphate surface. Neutron reflectometry experiments were also utilized to support the SSNMR results. By incorporating several deuterated residues in the COOH terminus of a nearly identical protein, these experiments demonstrated that the deuterated portion of the COOH terminus was an average distance of ∼10 Å from COO– terminated silicon surface (used to simulate the charged hydroxyapatite surface), in good agreement with the SSNMR data (details to be published elsewhere). Fig. 2 summarizes the results pictorially. In A, the solubilized protein is shown with a tertiary folding that orients the Ser16(P) residue away from the COOH terminus and the Ala46 residue (the folding depicted is shown purely for illustrative purposes). In B, the experimentally observed dephasing is explained by the interaction of Ala46 with the surface, confirmed by the control experiments with the unphosphorylated protein, LRAP-A*. In C, the interaction region is expanded, providing a more detailed view of the region of interest and the proximity of the Ala46 side chain to the HAP surface. Multiple 31P Interactions—While REDOR is an excellent technique for determining distances between isolated spin pairs, deconvoluting three or more interacting spins is not always possible. There are multiple phosphate groups in the HAP surface, and the labeled region could be close to more than one 31P, giving rise to a dephasing curve convoluted by multiple interactions. Simulations (22Bak M. Rasmussen J.T. Nielsen N.C. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 147: 296-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar) of the data in this work fit equally well to one 8-Å distance, a combination of an 8-Å and a 10-Å distance and a combination of two 9-Å distances. While other combinations likely fit the data within the error bars, these combinations are representative of those required to generate reasonable fits for three-spin interactions. For instance, a combination of a 7-Å and 11-Å distance dephases much too quickly, and a combination of two 10-Å distances dephases much too slowly. Four-spin models were also considered, with combinations of 8-, 10-, and 10.5-Å or 9-, 10-, and 11-Å distances fitting the data within the error bars. Irrespective of the number of phosphate groups nearby to 13C-labeled Ala46, simulations of the REDOR dephasing curve place the 13C-labeled Ala46 within 7–9 Å of the closest surface phosphate. The reported results are in complete agreement with the adsorption isotherms and growth kinetics by Aoba (14Aoba T. Fukae M. Tanabe T. Shimizu M. Moreno E.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1987; 41: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and Moradian-Oldak (15Moradian-Oldak J. Bouropoulos N. Wang L. Gharakhanian N. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that removal of the COOH terminus greatly reduced the ability of the amelogenin to interact with HAP. The experimental data presented here provide direct evidence that the COOH terminus is oriented near enough to HAP to allow the acidic residues of the COOH terminus to interact with the surface, removing any argument that previous observations were due to other contributions such as structural changes or protein-protein interactions. By extension, these data provide additional support that the COOH terminus is exposed on the surface of the amelogenin nanosphere and further demonstrate that the experimentally measured constraints favor interaction of the charged residues with HAP, necessary for protein directed mineral regulation. The SSNMR results presented here provide compelling evidence for the proximity of the COOH terminus of the amelogenin, LRAP, with the HAP crystal. These results support a role for the charged COOH terminus of amelogenin to interact directly with HAP, contributing to the control of enamel crystal growth by the organic matrix. These data are in complete agreement with previous literature but provide a direct measure of the orientation of the protein on its biologically relevant HAP surface, quantitatively identifying the interaction of the COOH-terminal region of the LRAP protein with the HAP surface. The proximity of the acidic residues and HAP further promote the COOH-terminal directed control of enamel crystallite development."

In animals, HA plays structural, recognition, and signaling roles. Certain pathogenic bacteria, namely Streptococcus Groups A and C and Pasteurella multocida Type A, utilize extracellular HA polysaccharide capsules to avoid host defenses and to increase virulence. The biological functions and biomedical applications of HA have long been of interest. It is now recognized that the HA of different sizes can have dramatically different effects on cellular behavior and growth (6Fieber C. Baumann P. Vallon R. Termeer C. Simon J.C. Hofmann M. Angel P.

Currently, the major method to generate HA is extraction from either rooster (chicken) comb or bacterial cultures. These HA preparations not only contain potential components from the original sources that could cause immunogenic, inflammatory, or allergenic responses but are also mixtures of a wide range of molecular masses. To interpret accurately the various biological functions of HA and to synthesize better HA-containing biomedical products, it is necessary to obtain uniform size-defined HA. HA synthases are the enzymes from vertebrates and microbes that polymerize the HA chain using UDP-sugar nucleotide precursors. The Class II HA synthase, pmHAS from Gram-negative P. multocida Type A, uses two separate glyco-syltransferase sites to add GlcNAc and GlcUA monosaccharides to the nascent HA chain (13Jing W.

This polymerization reaction occurs in a nonprocessive fashion where the enzyme binds, elongates, and releases the growing HA chain in a rapid repetitive fashion (13Jing W. DeAngelis P.L.

In this report, we utilize the acceptor elongation activity for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of a variety of HA polymers with narrow size distributions. Acceptor Preparation—All of the reagents were the highest grade available from either Sigma or Fisher unless otherwise noted. The tetrasaccharide HA4, the starting acceptor for the synthesis of longer polymers, was generated by exhaustive degradation of streptococcal HA polymer with ovine testicular hyaluronidase Type V and purified by extensive chloroform extraction, ultrafiltration, and size exclusion chromatography on P2 (Bio-Rad) resin with 0.2 m ammonium formate buffer. The volatile salts were removed by repeated lyophilization from water. The HA4 molecule was converted into a fluorescent derivative in two steps. First, an amino-HA4 derivative was prepared by reductive amination of HA4 (12 mm) with sodium cyanoborohydride (70 mm) and excess diaminoethane (200 mm) in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.5, 1 mm CuCl2 at 37 °C for 2 days. The amino-HA4 product was purified on P2 resin. Second, a fluorescent acceptor was prepared by derivatizing amino-HA4 with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of Oregon Green™ 488 (3-fold molar excess; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide, 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8.5. The major isomer of fluor-HA4 was purified by preparative normal-phase thin layer chromatography (2:1:1 n-butanol/acetic acid/water and silica, Whatman). The identities of HA4, amino-HA4, and fluor-HA4 were verified by virtue of the agreement of their expected and experimental masses (775, 819, and 1213 Da, respectively) as assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry in negative mode (17DeAngelis P.L.

Catalyst Preparation and in Vitro Synthesis—The catalyst, pmHAS1–703, is a soluble purified Escherichia coli derived recombinant protein (13Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The enzyme in the octyl thioglucoside cell extracts was purified by chromatography on Toyopearl Red AF resin (Tosoh) using salt elution (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 m ethylene glycol (an enzyme stabilizer) with 0–1.5 m NaCl gradient in 1 h) (17DeAngelis P.L. Oatman L.C. Gay D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35199-35203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The fractions containing the target protein (≥90% pure by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Blue-staining) were concentrated and exchanged into 1 m ethylene glycol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, by ultrafiltration with an Amicon spin unit (Millipore). The syntheses in general contained pmHAS1–703, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GlcUA, 5 mm MnCl2,1 m ethylene glycol, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 2–72 h. Analysis of in Vitro Synthesized HA—The size of HA was analyzed on agarose gels (0.7–1.2%; 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA); 40 V) stained with Stains-All dye (0.005% w/v in ethanol) (18Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Approximately 0.5–5 μg of HA was loaded per lane. For smaller HA polymers (<40 kDa), HA was also analyzed on polyacrylamide gels (15–20%) with acridine orange staining (19Ikegami-Kawai M. Takahashi T. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 311: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To purify HA for later analysis, pmHAS was removed by chloroform extraction and the HA product was precipitated with three volumes of ethanol and the pellets were redissolved in water. Alternatively, the unincorporated precursor sugars were removed by ultrafiltration (Microcon units, Millipore). The HA concentration was determined by the carbazole assay using a glucuronic acid standard (20Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). Size-exclusion chromatography/multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS) analysis was employed to determine the absolute molecular masses of HA products. Polymers (2.5–12 μg mass; 50-μl injection) were separated on PL Aquagel-OH 30 (8 μm), -OH 40, -OH 50, -OH 60 (15 μm) columns (7.5 × 300 mm, Polymer Laboratories, Amherst, MA) in tandem or alone as required by the size range of the polymers to be analyzed. The columns were eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7, at 0.5 ml/min. MALLS analysis of the eluant was performed by a DAWN DSP Laser Photometer in series with an OPTI-LAB DSP interferometric refractometer (632.8 nm; Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA). The ASTRA software package was used to determine the absolute average molecular mass using a dn/dc coefficient of 0.153 determined by Wyatt Technology. The Mw and polydispersity values are the average of data from at least two SEC-MALLS runs. Acceptor-mediated Synchronization of Reaction Yields Monodisperse HA Products—Recombinant pmHAS synthesizes HA chains in vitro if supplied with both required UDP-sugars (15DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Drake R.R. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) according to Equation 1nUDP-GlcUA+nUDP-GlcNAc→2nUDP + [GlcUA-GlcNAc]neq.1 However, if a HA-like oligosaccharide ([GlcUA-GlcNAc]x) is also supplied in vitro, the overall incorporation rate was elevated up to ∼50–100-fold (16DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We suggested that the rate of initiation of a new HA chain de novo was slower than the subsequent elongation (i.e. repetitive addition of sugars to a nascent HA molecule). The observed stimulation of synthesis by exogenous acceptor appears to operate by bypassing the kinetically slower initiation step, allowing the elongation reaction to predominate as shown in Equation 2nUDP-GlcU A + nUDP-GlcNAc +[GlcUA-GlcNAc]x→2nUDP + [GlcUA-GlcNAc]x+neq.2 We performed HA polymerization reactions with purified pmHAS and UDP-sugar precursors under various conditions and analyzed the reaction products by agarose gel electrophoresis and/or size exclusion chromatography with MALLS. We observed that the size distribution of HA products obtained was quite different depending on the presence or the absence of the HA4 acceptor. In summary, the reactions with acceptor produced smaller HA chains with a more narrow size distribution. An example is depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 where the reaction containing HA4 acceptor yielded a HA product with a Mw of 555 kDa and polydispersity (Mw/Mn; Mn = number average molecular weight) of 1.006, but the parallel reaction without acceptor resulted in a product with a Mw of 1.8 MDa and Mw/Mn of 1.17. For reference, the polydispersity value for an ideal monodisperse polymer equals 1.Fig. 2SEC-MALLS analysis of in vitro HA synthesis products in the presence or absence of HA4 acceptor. The refractometer concentration peaks (lines) and the molar mass curves (symbols with corresponding y axis scale) of the matched set of reactions described in Fig. 1 are shown on the same PL Aquagel-OH 60 SEC column profile. A smaller narrow size distribution HA polymer is formed by pmHAS in the presence of HA4 (thick line and squares) as evidenced by its later elution time and flatter molar mass curve in comparison to the reaction without acceptor (thin line and circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To explain the findings above, we further hypothesize that polymerization by pmHAS in the presence of an HA acceptor is a synchronized process. Reactions without the acceptor exhibit a lag period interspersed with numerous out of step initiation events that yield a short HA oligosaccharide (Fig. 3A). Once any HA chain is formed, the polymer is elongated rapidly. Other new HA chains that arise later during the lag period are also elongated rapidly, but the size of these younger chains never catches up to the older chains in a reaction with a finite amount of UDP-sugars. In contrast, in reactions containing an acceptor, all of the HA chains are elongated in parallel in a nonprocessive fashion resulting in a more homogenous final polymer population (Fig. 3B). For practical synthesis where there are more acceptor molecules than catalyst molecules, it is critical that processive elongation (i.e. no dissociation of the nascent HA chain and the synthase until polymerization is complete) does not occur because disparity would arise when some acceptor chains are elongated before other chains. Stoichiometric Control of HA Product Size—The two enzymological properties of recombinant pmHAS described above also allow for the control of HA polymer size in chemoenzymatic syntheses. First, as noted above, the rate-limiting step in vitro appears to be chain initiation. Therefore, pmHAS will transfer monosaccharides onto the existing HA acceptor chains before substantial de novo synthesis. Second, the enzyme polymerizes HA in a rapid nonprocessive fashion in vitro (13Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17DeAngelis P.L. Oatman L.C. Gay D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35199-35203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, the amount of HA4 should affect the final size of the HA product when a finite amount of UDP-sugar is present. The synthase will add all of the available UDP-sugar precursors to the nonreducing termini of acceptors as in the Equation 3nUDP−GlcUA+nUDP−GlcNAc +z[GlcUA−GlcNAc]x→2nUDP+z[GlcUA−GlcNAc]x+(n/z)eq.3 If there are many termini (i.e. z is large), a limited amount of UDP-sugars will be distributed among many molecules and thus result in many short polymer chain extensions (Fig. 3C). Conversely, if there are few termini (i.e. z is small), the limited amount of UDP-sugars will be distributed among few molecules and thus result in long polymer chain extensions (Fig. 3B). To test our speculation, we performed a series of assays utilizing various levels of HA4 with a fixed amount of UDP-sugar and pmHAS (Fig. 4). With this general strategy, we were able to generate HA from 16 kDa to 2 MDa with polydispersity ranging from 1.001 to ∼1.2 (Fig. 5). By controlling the molar ratio of acceptor to UDP-sugar, it is now possible to select the final HA polymer size desired. Typically, ∼50–70% of the starting UDP-sugars are consumed in the reactions on the basis of HA polysaccharide recovery.Fig. 5Comparison of synthetic HA versus natural HA preparations. A variety of HA samples either synthesized by synchronized chemoenzymatic reactions in vitro or derived from streptococcal bacteria or chicken sources were analyzed on a 0.7% agarose gel with Stains-All detection. The Mw of each synthetic HA polymer was determined by SEC-MALLS. Lane 1, a mixture of synthetic HA polymers produced in five different reactions (bottom to top, 27, 110, 214, 310 and 495 kDa); lane 2, a mixture of synthetic HA polymers produced in five different reactions (bottom to top, 495, 572, 966, 1090 and 1510 kDa); lane 3, 2.0-MDa synthetic HA; lane 4, rooster comb HA (Sigma); lane 5, streptococcal HA (Sigma); lanes 6 and 7, streptococcal HA (Lifecore); D, DNA HyperLadder. The tight bands of the synthetic HA polymers indicate their relative monodispersity in comparison to extracted HA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Interestingly, if an intermediate-sized molecular mass HA chain is prepared by this method, the chain may be elongated by simply adding more UDP-sugars to the reaction mixture provided that the active catalyst is present. The resulting polymers migrate as tight bands on gels and appear quite monodisperse throughout the entire reaction time course even after multiple additions of UDP-sugars. The resulting bands with steadily increasing molecular masses indicated that HA polymers larger than oligosaccharides (∼20 kDa to 1.3 MDa) may also be utilized as starting material for chain elongation by pmHAS (data not shown). In Vitro Synthesis of Tagged or Labeled HA—Our technology for the production of monodisperse polymers also allows the use of a modified acceptor to synthesize HA polymers containing various types of foreign moieties. The pmHAS adds monosaccharides to the nonreducing terminus of the acceptor chain (16DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26557-26562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); thus the aldehyde functionality of the reducing end is available for reaction by numerous chemical schemes. An example is shown using fluorescent HA4 acceptor to produce fluorescent monodisperse HA of various sizes (Fig. 6). Similarly, radioactive (e.g.3H, 125I) or affinity (e.g. biotin) tagged HA polymer are possible with the appropriate modified acceptor (data not shown). Alternatively, the substitution of all or a portion of the unlabeled UDP-sugars in a chemoenzymatic synthesis reaction with a radioactive precursor (e.g. UDP-[3H]GlcUA) is a very useful method to produce labeled HA probes (data not shown). The advantage of this method is that the radioactive HA does not contain any foreign non-sugar moieties that might interfere with biological function or cause mistargeting. Utility of Synthetic HA—The molecular masses of most commercially available HA preparations are usually in the 105-106 Da range (3Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). For research requiring smaller HA polymers, degradation via enzymatic (e.g. hyaluronidase digestion) or chemical (e.g. radicals or oxidation) or physical (e.g. ultrasonication) methods are usually employed. However, this process is not always satisfactory because it is time-consuming, the final yield of the targeted HA size is low, and at least one demanding chromatographic step is usually required. We can generate HA as small as ∼15 kDa with polydispersity (Mw/Mn) around 1.001 with the current synchronized stoichiometrically controlled synthesis technique. If the synthesis of smaller monodisperse HA oligosaccharides (<25 monosaccharide in length or ∼5 kDa) is required, it is preferable to utilize a pair of reactors with immobilized mutant pmHAS enzymes (a GlcUA transferase and a GlcNAc transferase) operating in an alternating repetitive fashion (17DeAngelis P.L. Oatman L.C. Gay D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35199-35203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). High molecular weight HA preparations are commercially available from animal or bacterial sources, but inherent problems including possible contaminants and broad size distributions complicate research. Polydispersities of commercially available HA polymers are commonly higher than 1.5. Indeed, there exists a substantial need for uniform HA in biomedical studies (21Uebelhart D. Williams J.M. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1999; 11: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that narrow size distribution, high molecular mass HA (∼1–2 MDa), is also readily prepared by synchronized, stoichiometrically controlled reactions (Fig. 5). Work in progress focuses on extending this product size range upwards. To determine the exact average molecular mass of HA, MALLS is usually the choice. Yet many researchers need to quickly estimate the molecular mass, but they lack the required instrumentation. The correlation of HA migration on agarose gels with DNA (18Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) is often used for this purpose. Drawbacks of this method include the following. (i) The original “calibration standard” HA samples were not uniform or monodisperse, and (ii) the migration of HA and DNA on agarose gels changes differentially with alteration of the agarose concentration. A ladder comprised of an assortment of synthetic HA polymers with defined, narrow size distributions (Fig. 5) provides an excellent series of standards for characterizing the size of HA in experimental samples. In general, our unique technology platform allows the generation of a variety of improved synthetic HA tools with narrow size distributions and defined compositions for elucidating the numerous roles of HA in health and disease. We also expect that similar synchronized, stoichiometrically controlled reactions utilizing the other Pasteurella glycosaminoglycan synthases (5DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 9R-16RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) will allow the chemoenzymatic synthesis of monodisperse chondroitin and heparosan polymers in the future. We thank Leonard C.

https://openalex.org/W2094689890,"ATF6 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-anchored transcription factor activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis in the ER stress response. The release of the cytosolic transcription factor domain of ATF6 requires the sequential processing by the Golgi site-1 and site-2 proteases (S1P and S2P). It has been unclear why S2P proteolysis relies on previous site-1 cleavage. One possibility is that S2P localizes to a different cellular compartment than S1P; however, here we show that S2P localizes to the same compartment as S1P, the cis/medial-Golgi. In addition, we have re-localized S1P and S2P to the ER with brefeldin A and find that the sequential cleavage of ATF6 is reconstituted in the ER. The mapping of the region of ATF6 required for sequential S1P and S2P cleavage showed that short luminal domains resulted in S1P-independent S2P cleavage. The addition of artificial domains onto these short ATF6 luminal domains restored the S1P dependence of S2P cleavage, suggesting that it is the size rather than specific sequences in the luminal domain that determines the S1P dependence of S2P cleavage. These results suggest that the bulky ATF6 luminal domain blocks S2P cleavage and that the role of S1P is to reduce the size of the luminal domain to prepare ATF6 to be an optimal S2P substrate.

When the transmembrane signaling factors are activated, they can be cleaved by intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) within the plane of the membrane. This cleavage liberates cytosolic fragments that enter the nucleus to regulate gene transcription (1Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 2Golde T.E. Eckman C.B.

Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). RIP represents a direct signaling pathway from the membrane to the nucleus and markedly contrasts with signaling pathways involving second messengers or cascades of phosphorylation. One of the RIP-regulated factors is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-associated basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF6 (4Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). ATF6 controls the expression of genes involved in ER protein folding and trafficking. It is synthesized as an ER membrane-tethered precursor and activated by intramembrane proteolysis in a signaling pathway known as the ER stress response or unfolded protein response (5Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 6Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The ER is the site for the synthesis and folding of proteins destined to enter the secretory pathway, and perturbations in the ER environment can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen (so called ER stress) (7Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 827-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 8Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). ER stress induces a highly coordinated adaptive response including up-regulation of a number of genes involved in protein folding, trafficking, and degradation. ATF6 activation plays an essential role in the transcriptional induction of the ER stress-inducible genes (4Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar, 10Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). A general feature of RIP is that the proteolysis is tightly regulated and that this regulatory step usually includes a juxtamembrane cleavage preceding the intramembrane proteolysis. Examples of this include the cleavage of notch and amyloid precursor protein by presenilin, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) by site-2 protease, and signal peptides by signal peptide protease (1Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In each of these cases, a primary cleavage reaction removes much of the luminal domain and allows the subsequent cleavage by an intramembrane protease. After the first cleavage trims off the extracellular domain, the second cleavage within the lipid bilayer appears to be automatic, suggesting that the first cleavage reaction is the critical regulatory step (2Golde T.E. Eckman C.B. Science's STKE. 2003; (www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2003/172/re4)PubMed Google Scholar). Tight regulation of ATF6 is conferred by its controlled translocation from the ER to the Golgi where active site-1 protease (S1P) resides. This trafficking is controlled by the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78 that binds to ATF6 and dissociates in response to ER stress (6Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 11Chen X. Shen J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13045-13052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The activation of ATF6 in the Golgi involves a two-step cleavage process typical to many RIP events. In the first step, ATF6 is cut within its luminal domain by S1P, a membrane-bound serine protease of the subtilisin family with its active site in the Golgi lumen. This step separates ATF6 into two halves. The N-terminal membrane-associated fragment retains a short luminal sequence (∼20 residues) and is further cleaved by site-2 protease (S2P) within its transmembrane region, yielding a free cytoplasmic fragment that enters the nucleus to function as a transcriptional activator. S2P is a Zn2+ metalloprotease categorized to the rapidly expanding family of I-CLiPs that all have their catalytic sites embedded within the lipid bilayer (12Zelenski N.G. Rawson R.B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21973-21980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The processing of ATF6 by S2P strictly requires prior cleavage by S1P. In S1P mutant cell lines or where S1P activity was blocked, S2P failed to process ATF6 into its active form (4Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar, 6Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev.

Chem. 2003; 278: 31024-31032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, ATF6 bearing mutations in its S1P cleavage site was not processed by S2P (4Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar, 11Chen X. Shen J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13045-13052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). There are several possible models to account for this dependence that is also seen with other RIP-regulated factors (1Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). First, S2P may be localized in the cell differently than S1P or ATF6 and cleavage by S1P may be required for ATF6 to move to the location of S2P. Second, specific sequences in ATF6 may block S2P cleavage until they are removed by S1P digestion. These sequences could inhibit ATF6 by specifically interacting with S2P or by sterically blocking its access to the cleavage site. In the case of notch processing, the size of its luminal domain seems to block its intramembrane cleavage by presenilin, suggesting that inhibition may be by steric hindrance (14Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). However, in the case of the bacterial substrate RseA and the intramembrane protease YaeL, specific glutamine-rich sequences in the luminal domain of RseA were required to block YaeL digestion (15Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6389-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A third model is that cleavage by S1P could create a substrate site for S2P binding and cleavage. In this study, we sought to distinguish these models. Materials and Constructs—Brefeldin A (BFA), 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), anti-FLAG M2 antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse sera were obtained from Sigma. ECL plus reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody was from Covance. ATF6 and its derivatives were cloned into the p3×FLAG-cytomegalovirus 7.1 or 14 vectors (Sigma) to generate constructs encoding fusion proteins with three tandem copies of the FLAG epitope at their N termini (vector 7.1) or C termini (vector 14). pCGN-S2P, which encodes HA-tagged human S2P, was obtained by inserting S2P cDNA into the pCGN vector (16Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The S2P cDNA was from an IMAGE EST clone (clone ID number 3881297). GFP fusion proteins were constructed by cloning the cDNAs into the pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech). All of these expression constructs are under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. cDNAs for IRE1α, SREBP2, and immunoglobulin heavy chain were kindly provided by Drs. Randal Kaufman, Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein, and Linda Hendershot, respectively. The Golgi marker DS1-GT was kindly provided by Dr. Karin Schwab (German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany) and encodes red fluorescent protein fused to the transmembrane region of galactosyl transferase. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunoblotting—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. HeLa cells were transiently transfected using the standard calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method as previously described (11Chen X. Shen J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13045-13052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed once in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 20–24 h after transfection and then lysed in SDS loading buffer (2% SDS, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, and 0.33% β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies as previously described (6Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence and GFP Microscopy—HeLa cells seeded and transfected on coverslips were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized for 10 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were blocked overnight in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin and subsequently incubated with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in PBS at room temperature. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA (1:200) was used as the primary antibody, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:50) was the secondary antibody. The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides and observed under the Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope at ×400 magnification with appropriate filters for fluorescence detection. To visualize GFP fusion proteins, living cells maintained in tissue culture medium were observed under the same fluorescent microscope. Localization of S2P—One model for sequential cleavage of ATF6 is that S1P and S2P reside in different membrane compartments and that, after S1P cleavage, the ATF6 intermediate fragment can move to the S2P compartment. We sought to test this model by probing where S2P can cleave ATF6. The first clue of S2P distribution came from our studies on an ATF6 variant (amino acids 1–430), which has a short luminal domain (∼30 aa), similar to the intermediate form of ATF6 (ATF6-(1–418)) that results from S1P proteolysis (Fig. 1A). When transiently expressed, the intermediate form of ATF6-(1–418) was not targeted to the ER membrane properly, whereas ATF6-(1–430) localized to the ER (Fig. 1C and data not shown). Surprisingly, when expressed in unstressed cells, ATF6-(1–430) was not constitutively processed to the mature form (Fig. 1B, compare lane 5 with lane 4), because it was generally thought that the second cleavage is automatic once S1P proteolysis occurs. This markedly contrasts with previous results with SREBP2 processing (17Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). When transiently expressed, SREBP2-(21–530), which mimics the site-1 cleavage product, was constitutively cleaved by S2P into the mature form (17Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). To resolve this discrepancy, we examined the cellular localization of the two variants. We found that GFP-tagged ATF6-(1–430) was primarily localized to the ER, similar to wild-type ATF6 (Fig. 1C). To block potential S2P cleavage of SREBP2, we used a variant with mutations in the transmembrane region that block S2P cleavage (18Ye J. Dave U.P. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5123-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In contrast to GFP-ATF6-(1–430), GFP-SREBP2(21–530)S2P- localized to the Golgi. It concentrated to the perinuclear region and co-localized with a Golgi marker protein DS1-GT that encodes red fluorescent protein fused to the transmembrane region of galactosyl transferase (Fig. 1C). This Golgi localization pattern of the SREBP2 variant was disrupted by BFA, a chemical that causes the relocation of Golgi proteins into the ER (19Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar), further supporting its Golgi localization (Fig. 1C). The same SREBP2 variant with a wild-type S2P site (GFP-SREBP2-(21–530)) gave a diffuse pattern of fluorescence, suggesting that it is constitutively cleaved by S2P (data not shown) (17Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Since Golgi-localized SREBP2-(21–530) was processed by S2P while ER-localized ATF6-(1–430) was not, this finding suggests that S2P is probably localized to the Golgi. ATF6-(1–430) localizes to the ER, because it lacks its Golgi localization sequences (6Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). It is somewhat surprising that SREBP2-(21–530) localizes to the Golgi, because it lacks C-terminal sequences that interact with its molecular escort SREBP cleavage-activating protein, which is normally responsible for SREBPs translocation to the Golgi in low sterol media (20Rawson R.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To more directly determine the cellular localization of S2P, we expressed S2P with an N-terminal HA epitope tag and observed the protein distribution by immunofluorescence. HA-S2P localized to a perinuclear region in HeLa cells and colocalized with the Golgi marker protein DS1-GT (Fig. 2, top). The treatment of the cells with BFA rapidly redistributed S2P into the ER (Fig. 2, bottom). Because BFA only re-localizes cis/medial-Golgi proteins without affecting the trans-Golgi network (19Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar), these results suggest that S2P predominantly resides in the cis/medial-Golgi complex. Since S1P has also been shown to localize to the cis/medial-Golgi (21DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Li W.P. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 1999; 99: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), our data demonstrate that both S1P and S2P are localized in the same compartment of the cell. This co-localization suggests that, once transported to the Golgi, ATF6 encounters both S1P and S2P and argues against S2P localization precluding digestion of Golgi-localized ATF6. Mapping of ATF6 Sequences Required to Block S2P Cleavage—Since both S1P and S2P reside within the cis/medial-Golgi while ATF6 is in the ER in unstressed cells, we sought to reconstitute ATF6-proteolytic processing by S1P and S2P in the ER using BFA. This would be expected to allow proteolytic processing to occur in the ER independent of ER stress. Indeed, we found that BFA treatment generated the mature form of ATF6 co-migrating with that induced by DTT treatment (Fig. 3A). To demonstrate the S1P dependence of this processing, the cells were treated with AEBSF, an S1P protease inhibitor that does not interfere with S2P activity (13Okada T. Haze K. Nadanaka S. Yoshida H. Seidah N.G. Hirano Y. Sato R. Negishi M. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31024-31032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In cells treated with AEBSF, both the BFA- and DTT-induced generations of the mature form of ATF6 were abolished, suggesting that S2P cannot act on intact full-length ATF6 in the absence of S1P activity (Fig. 3A). Therefore, our reconstitution of the two-step ATF6 processing in the ER accurately recapitulated the dependence of S2P proteolysis on previous site-1 cleavage. Whereas wild-type ATF6 was not cleaved by S2P when S1P activity was blocked, we found that the ATF6 variant (ATF6-(1–430)) could be processed by S2P in cells treated with AEBSF (Fig. 3B). Whereas ATF6-(1–430) is similar to the S1P-cleaved intermediate ATF6 form (amino acids 1–418), it is not identical, suggesting that the precise formation of this form is not necessary to create an S2P recognition site. Rather, the cleavage of ATF6-(1–430), independent of S1P digestion, suggests that the luminal domain of ATF6 normally blocks S2P cleavage. We next sought to determine the mechanism of the inhibitory effect by mapping regions of ATF6 luminal domain that block S2P proteolysis. As noted in the Introduction, cleavage of the RIP substrates Notch and RseA by the intramembrane proteases is also blocked by the luminal domains of the substrates but by markedly different mechanisms. For Notch, the general size of the luminal domain appears to be critical while specific glutamine-rich sequences in RseA blocked its site-2 digestion by YaeL (14Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 15Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6389-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We constructed a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of ATF6 and examined whether they could be cleaved by S2P in cells treated with BFA and the S1P inhibitor AEBSF. These ATF6 variants all retain transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain as well as S1P and S2P cleavage sites but have different lengths of their luminal domains (Fig. 4A). Reconstitution of the two-step cleavage in the ER using BFA allowed the deletion variants to be tested for S1P and S2P processing, as some of these variants cannot move to the Golgi in response to ER stress because of the loss of Golgi localization signals (6Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The addition of the S1P inhibitor AEBSF allowed us to assess whether S2P could digest the variants independent of prior S1P cleavage. For convenience, we divided the luminal domain of ATF6 into six segments and named them luminal domains 1–6 (LD1–LD6) (Fig. 4A). Each of the LD segments was progressively removed. All of these mutants localized to the ER (data not shown), and BFA induced their processing to the mature ATF6 form (Fig. 4, B–H). The addition of the S1P inhibitor AEBSF showed that the deletion of LD5 and LD6 did not affect the requirement for prior S1P cleavage (Fig. 4, B and C). However, further deletion of LD4 in ATF6-(1–475) resulted in a protein that could be cleaved by S2P independent of S1P proteolysis (Fig. 4D). The C-terminal deletion to aa 450 gave a similar result (Fig. 4E). These results suggest that the LD4 domain (aa 476–500) might contain specific sequences essential for blocking S2P digestion. To test this possibility, we made an internal deletion of the LD4 region in the context of full-length ATF6. However, this variant, ATF6-(Δ476–500), was resistant to S2P digestion when S1P activity was blocked with AEBSF, suggesting that LD4 is not required for the S2P avoidance property (Fig. 4F). It is possible that multiple sequences exist in the luminal domain of ATF6 that can specifically block S2P or, alternatively, that the S2P blocking activity is not due to a specific sequence but rather to the size of the luminal domain of ATF6. We tested for the latter model by replacing the luminal domain of ATF6 with the domains from two irrelevant proteins: 1) immunoglobulin heavy chain (Ig HC) and 2) IRE1α. Ig HC is a secreted protein that is normally processed in the ER, whereas IRE1α is a constitutive ER transmembrane protein (22Vanhove M. Usherwood Y.K. Hendershot L.M. Immunity. 2001; 15: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Harding H.P. Clark S.G. Ron D. Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). Because neither of these proteins is a substrate of S1P or S2P, it is highly unlikely that these proteins contain any specific sequences that interfere with S2P activity. When Ig HC was fused to ATF6-(1–430), the resultant chimera ATF6-HC was still cleaved in response to BFA (Fig. 4G). This digestion was blocked by AEBSF, demonstrating that it was S1P-dependent and that the addition of the Ig HC domain was sufficient to block S2P cleavage. Similar results were obtained when the luminal domain of IRE1α (aa 30–443) was fused to ATF6-(1–430), although the amount of S2P cleavage product induced by BFA was relatively low (Fig. 4H). These results demonstrate that the fusion of Ig HC or IRE1α can inhibit the ability of S2P to cleave ATF6-(1–430) and strongly suggest that it is the size, rather than the specific sequence of the luminal domain of ATF6, that blocks S2P cleavage. Estimated from the C-terminal deletion mutants, the substrates with luminal domains longer than 100 residues are not substrates of S2P. Therefore, the role of S1P is to convert ATF6 into an optimal S2P substrate by shortening its luminal domain. ATF6 Luminal Domain Cannot Block S2P Cleavage in trans—A specific interaction was found between the substrate RseA and the intramembrane protease YaeL (15Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6389-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To test whether there was a functional interaction between the luminal domain of ATF6 and S2P, we overexpressed the isolated luminal domain of ATF6 and tested whether it could function as a dominant negative form to block S2P proteolysis of ATF6. We reasoned that, if there is specific association between S2P and the luminal domain of ATF6, overexpression of the latter should interact with and inhibit S2P, such that ATF6 proteolysis would be blocked. We fused the signal peptide of Ig HC to the luminal domain of ATF6 to target it to the ER and included a C-terminal epitope tag for detection (Fig. 5A). This construct resulted in the expression of a 45-kDa protein that was localized to the ER (Fig. 5B and data not shown). ATF6-(1–430) was expressed with the soluble luminal domain of ATF6 and induced for S2P digestion with BFA. We estimate from immunoblots that the luminal domain was expressed three times more strongly than ATF6-(1–430) (data not shown). We found that the overexpression of the luminal domain of ATF6 did not affect the processing of ATF6-(1–430) (Fig. 5C). These results further suggest that there is no specific interaction between the luminal domain of ATF6 and S2P that could account for inhibition of S2P activity. We found that the dependence of S2P proteolysis of ATF6 on prior site-1 cleavage is due to the size of the luminal domain of substrate that blocks S2P cleavage until it is removed by S1P digestion. We ruled out an alternative model that S2P is localized in a different cellular compartment by showing that it co-localized with S1P in the Golgi. In addition, the precise C terminus created by S1P cleavage was not required for S2P recognition since variants with longer luminal domains were still efficiently cleaved. Further, there does not appear to be a specific sequence in the luminal domain of ATF6 that blocks S2P cleavage since the internal deletion of a sequence identified by C-terminal truncation did not affect inhibition of S2P digestion. More importantly, the replacement of the luminal domain of ATF6 with two irrelevant proteins reconstituted the inhibition of S2P digestion, suggesting that it is the size rather than the specificity of the sequence that is responsible. This is markedly different from the two-step processing of RseA in a bacterial extracytoplasmic stress response. In this case, the luminal domain of RseA was found to contain two glutamine-rich regions that interact with the intramembrane protease YaeL PDZ domain and thereby silence the enzymatic activity of YaeL (15Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6389-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, our result with ATF6 is quite similar to that of presenilin digestion of Notch in Drosophila. The cleavage of Notch by presenilin was blocked when the extracellular domain was ∼300 amino acids and digested efficiently when it was ∼50 amino acids long (14Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Similarly, for ATF6 we found that 100 amino acids or more in the luminal domain blocked S2P digestion while 75 amino acids or less did not. The size of the luminal domain cannot account for the requirement of S2P cleavage of SREBP for prior S1P digestion, because SREBP does not contain a large luminal domain. SREBP contains two transmembrane domains, such that is has a short luminal loop of 30 amino acids between the two transmembrane domains with both the N and C termini in the cytosol (20Rawson R.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The S2P cleavage site is within the first transmembrane helix of SREBP, whereas the S1P site is in the luminal loop. S1P cleavage removes the attachment of the second transmembrane and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains. This raises the possibility that the second transmembrane region of SREBP may play a similar role as the luminal domain of ATF6 in preventing S2P proteolysis. This provides an alternative mechanism to inhibition by a large luminal domain and may reflect the strategy used by SREBP. How is this inhibition achieved? The simplest explanation is that a bulky luminal domain or a second transmembrane domain blocks access of the protease to the substrate site in the membrane. Another I-CLiP, presenilin, is the core of the γ-secretase complex that also requires nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2 for activity (24Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The activity of S2P in vitro has yet to be demonstrated, and it is likely that it also requires additional components. In addition, S2P is a polytopic membrane protein with at least four transmembrane domains (12Zelenski N.G. Rawson R.B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21973-21980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is easy to envision that the S2P catalytic center is surrounded by multiple transmembrane helices, leaving limited space for substrate entry, such that a second transmembrane domain or a bulky luminal domain in a substrate might block S2P access to its substrate cleavage sites. As a result, previous juxtamembrane proteolysis is required to convert the substrates into a form accessible to the protease. An alternative model that has been proposed for SREBP is that the removal of its second transmembrane domain by S1P allows movement of the substrate site within the membrane (18Ye J. Dave U.P. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5123-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This type of mechanism seems less likely with ATF6 where the difference of a luminal domain of 100 versus 75 amino acids determined S2P cleavage. This difference would have to differentially affect the conformation or position of the proximal transmembrane domain. However, it is notable that several intramembrane proteases require helix-breaking residues within the transmembrane regions of their substrates for cleavage. The mutation of the helix-breaking asparagine and proline residues within ATF6 and SREBP blocked S2P digestion (4Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1355-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar, 18Ye J. Dave U.P. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5123-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained with signal peptide peptidase and the Drosophila protease Rhomboid that digests Spitz (25Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Urban S. Freeman M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1425-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the positions of these residues within the membrane were found to be rather flexible, such that shifting their positions did not affect intramembrane proteolysis (18Ye J. Dave U.P. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5123-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1425-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Hence, it was proposed that it might be the general conformation, rather than a specific recognition motif, that determines intramembrane proteolysis. Helix-breaking residues may create extended structures accessible for intramembrane proteases, whereas a lack of these residues would result in rigid helical conformations resistant to digestion (25Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Urban S. Freeman M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1425-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In general, the I-CLiP proteases require prior substrate cleavage for digestion. The exception is Rhomboid, which can cleave full-length Spitz (1Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 26Urban S. Freeman M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1425-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The main difference of Rhomboid from the other proteases is that its function is to release the extracytoplasmic domain of its substrate from the membrane, whereas the other factors cause the release of intracellular domains (1Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that digestion by Rhomboid is more specific than the other I-CLiP proteases, such that it does not require the specificity provided by the first-step protease (26Urban S. Freeman M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1425-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the Rhomboid substrate Spitz contains a cytoplasmic region of only ∼70 amino acids and a luminal domain of ∼120 amino acids, such that these sequences may be too short to inhibit Rhomboid activity. In contrast to Rhomboid, the proteases signal peptide peptidase, presenilin, YaeL, and S2P all require prior cleavage of their substrates (1Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Presenilin is part of the γ-secretase complex that digests amyloid precursor protein as well as Notch. Digestion by γ-secretase and S2P is blocked by regions of 100–300 amino acids in the luminal domains of Notch and ATF6. It will be interesting to determine whether this rule holds up with other substrates such as amyloid precursor protein or other intramembrane proteases such as signal peptide peptidase. We thank Drs.

Cell adhesion is a fundamental biological process that is mediated by specific interactions between adhesion receptors and their ligands on other cell surfaces or in extracellular matrix (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar, 2Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6765) Google Scholar). For example, interactions between selectins and glycoconjugates mediate leukocyte tethering to and rolling on vascular surfaces at sites of inflammation or injury (3Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol.

As another example, circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) binds to foreign particles or damaged tissue through their dual antigen-binding fragments (Fab). The conserved Fc fragment of this bifunctional molecule is available for binding by Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) on the immune cell surface. Such binding triggers a wide variety of immune responses (6van de Winkel J.G. Capel P.J. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 215-221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar).To mediate cell adhesion, the interacting receptors and ligands must anchor apposing surfaces of two cells or of a cell and the substratum, i.e. two-dimensional binding, which differs from interactions in the fluid phase, i.e. three-dimensional binding. The binding affinity Ka is the ratio of equilibrium concentration of bonds to those of free receptors and ligands. However, concentration is measured as number of molecules per volume in three dimensions but number of molecules per area (i.e. surface density) in two dimensions, resulting in different units for Ka (m-1 in three dimensions and μm2 in two dimensions). The kinetic forward rate kf also has different units in different dimensions (m-1 s-1 in three dimensions and μm2 s-1 in two dimensions). The two-dimensional kf is the rate of bond formation between unit densities of receptors and ligands that are respectively anchored on two apposing surfaces of unit area. By comparison, the three-dimensional kf is the rate of bond formation between unit concentrations of receptors and ligands at least one of which is in solution of unit volume. There has been increasing recognition that two-dimensional binding parameters are not readily conversable from their three-dimensional counterparts (7Dustin M.L. Bromley S.K. Davis M.M. Zhu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). One of the reasons for this is that two-dimensional interactions are influenced by the surface environment, just as three-dimensional interactions are affected by the solvent environment (8Williams T.E. Nagarajan S. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13283-13288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One of the surface environmental factors is the distance that the binding pocket of the adhesion receptor extends outward from the cell surface. For example, extending the binding site of CD58 above the cell membrane by interposing four Ig-like domains (∼15 nm) in the stalk enhances its binding to CD2 on T lymphocytes (9Chan P.Y. Springer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Under static conditions, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1)-expressing neutrophils adhere equivalently to cells expressing wild-type P-selectin that contains 9 CR units and to P-selectin constructs with as few as two CRs. However, P-selectin requires at least 5 CRs to mediate optimal rolling of flowing neutrophils under dynamic shear conditions (10Patel K.D. Nollert M.U. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). K562 cells bearing 2-GSP-6, a glycosulfopeptide modeled after the binding domain of PSGL-1, which was attached to the membrane-distal region of a nonbinding molecule ∼50 nm above the cell surface, roll more stably on P-selectin than cells bearing 2-GSP-6 randomly attached to cell surface proteins (11Yago T.

HL-60 cells adhere to immobilized full-length E-selectin that contains all six CRs but not to shorter E-selectin constructs with two or less CRs (12Li S.H. Burns D.K. Rumberger J.M. Presky D.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4431-4437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Another surface environmental factor is the orientation of the binding pockets of adhesion receptors. For example, HL-60 cells adhere to the short E-selectin constructs with two or less CRs when they are captured by a nonblocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) adsorbed on the plastic surface (12Li S.H. Burns D.K. Rumberger J.M. Presky D.H. Wilkinson V.L. Anostario Jr, M. Wolitzky B.A. Norton C.R. Familletti P.C. Kim K.J. Goldstein A.L. Cox D.C. Huang K.S. J. Biol.

The ligand binding affinity and kinetics of FcγRIIIA (CD16A) are affected by its surface anchor (glycosylphosphatidylinositol or transmembrane) (13Chesla S.E. Li P. Nagarajan S. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. J.

Cell adhesion to fibronectin is modulated by surface chemistries that alter fibronectin adsorption (14Michael K.E. Vernakar V.N. Keselowsky B.G. Meredith J.C. Latour R.A. García A.J.

Cells expressing an L-selectin construct that replaces its EGF domain with the EGF domain of P-selectin roll better on L-selectin ligands than cells expressing wild-type L-selectin, perhaps because an altered orientation of the lectin domain enhances the association rate with surface ligands (15Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).The differential effects of shortening P-selectin on adhesion under flow and static conditions (10Patel K.D. Nollert M.U. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) suggest that altering molecular length may affect the kinetics of the receptor-ligand interaction.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) suggests that orientation also influences kinetics. To directly test this possibility, we quantified the effects of molecular orientation and length on cell adhesion by comparing the two-dimensional kinetics of the same molecules coupled to the surface of human red blood cells (RBCs) using different methods: coating via chromium chloride (CrCl3) coupling, which led to random orientation, or capturing by a nonblocking mAb, which resulted in a more uniform orientation, or direct binding to the RBC surface via an anti-human RBC antibody, which yielded fully uniform orientation. Two-dimensional kinetics was also compared between captured short and long constructs of the same molecule. In addition, three-dimensional affinities and two-dimensional bindings of a mAb to surface-bound P-selectin constructs of different orientations and lengths were compared. Our results indicate that the orientation and length influence the two-dimensional forward rate but not the two-dimensional reverse rate of the molecular interaction, whereas they have no effects on three-dimensional affinity. These results provide insights into the biophysical mechanisms by which the molecular orientations and lengths of adhesion receptors affect cell adhesion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies, Proteins, and Cells—Anti-P-selectin blocking (G1) and capturing (S12) (16Geng J.G.

Coupling efficiency of proteins was examined by flow cytometry, using CD58 that is constitutively expressed on RBC at a known density as a standard (27Selvaraj P. Plunkett M.L. Dustin M. Sanders M.E. Shaw S. Springer T.A. Nature. 1987; 326: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Selectin constructs and RbIgG so coated were randomly oriented (Fig. 1, a–c). To obtain a more uniform orientation, selectin constructs were captured on mAb-coated RBCs by incubation with 50–200 ng/ml of selectin constructs for 30 min at 4 °C before the micropipette experiment (Fig. 1, a, b,and d). To obtain fully uniform orientation of RbIgG for CD16A binding, RBCs were incubated with 10 ng/ml rabbit anti-human RBC polyclonal antibody for 30 min at 4 °C prior to the micropipette experiment (Fig. 1c).Site Density Determination—Site densities of proteins coated on RBCs or expressed on CHO cells were measured using flow cytometry and/or immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). To measure densities of randomly oriented selectins coated via CrCl3 coupling, RBCs were incubated with anti-selectin blocking mAbs (G1 or ES1) at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 200 μl of FACS buffer (RPMI 1640, 5 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% sodium azide) on ice for 40 min, and then incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. To measure densities of randomly or uniformly oriented RbIgG, RBCs were directly incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody. To measure CD16A expression, CHO cells were incubated first with anti-CD16 mAb CLBFcgran-1 and then with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. After washing, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The site densities were then calculated by comparing the fluorescence intensities of the cells with those of standard beads (Bangs Labs, Fishers, IN) (24Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To measure densities of uniformly oriented selectins (sPs, sEs, or PLE), one set of RBCs pre-coated with a range of densities of the relevant capturing mAb (five to seven densities for each selectin) were incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody and the fluorescence intensities were measured using flow cytometry as above. Another set of RBCs precoated with the same range of densities of capturing mAb was incubated with the corresponding selectin and their site densities were measured by IRMA (21Ushiyama S. Laue T.M.

A calibration curve was obtained for each selectin by plotting the selectin site density against the mean fluorescence intensity of the capturing mAb, thereby allowing calculation of the site densities of the uniformly oriented selectin from the mean fluorescence intensities of the capturing mAb.Two-dimensional Kinetics Measurements—The micropipette adhesion frequency assay for measuring two-dimensional kinetics has previously been described (24Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 25Williams T.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys.

Briefly, a single selectin (or RbIgG)-coated RBC and a single carbohydrate ligand-expressing HL-60 cell (or a CD16A-expressing CHO cell) was, respectively, aspirated by two micropipettes with respective diameters of ∼1.5 and ∼3 μm via a suction pressure of 1–4 mm H2O (10–40 pN/μm2). Adhesion between the RBC and the HL-60 (or CHO) cell was staged by placing them onto controlled contact via micromanipulation. The presence of adhesion at the end of a given contact period was detected mechanically by observing microscopically the deflection of the flexible RBC membrane upon retracting it away from the HL-60 (or CHO) cell. Such detection was reliable and unambiguous for >90% of the retractions, as clearly observable membrane deflections could be generated by a force as low as 2 pN at the RBC apex, far lower than the strength of a single bond (24Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 25Williams T.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1858-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This contact-retraction cycle was repeated a hundred times to estimate the adhesion probability, Pa, at that contact duration, t. For each surface presentation of each molecular species examined, ∼100 pairs of cells were used to obtain several Pa versus t curves that correspond to different receptor and ligand densities, mr and ml. Each binding curve was fitted to a small system probabilistic kinetic model (24Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 25Williams T.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys.

Multiple pairs of (kr0, mlAcKa0) or (mlAcKa0, AcKa0) values were obtained for each molecular orientation and length to allow evaluation of the mean and S.D. The statistical significance of (or the lack thereof) the difference between the two-dimensional affinities (or reverse rates) of the same pair of interacting molecules being presented on the cell surface with different orientation or distance above the membrane was assessed using the Student's t test.In one set of experiments, adhesion frequencies between RBCs coated with G1 via CrCl3 coupling and RBCs coated with P-selectin constructs of different orientations or lengths were measured at a single contact time of 4 s, and the results were expressed as -ln[1 - Pa]/(mrml). 5–6 pairs of cells were measured for each P-selectin surface presentation, and the statistical significance of the differences between results from different conditions were assessed by the Student's t test.Three-dimensional Affinity Measurements—Scatchard analysis was used to determine three-dimensional binding affinities of 125I-labeled G1 in fluid phase for either long (sPs) or short (PLE) P-selectin constructs coated on RBC surfaces either uniformly by capturing mAbs (S12 or 1478) precoated via CrCl3 coupling or randomly via direct CrCl3 coupling (29Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17759) Google Scholar, 21Ushiyama S. Laue T.M. Moore K.L. Erickon H.P. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15229-15237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of 0.1–6 μg/ml 125I-G1 was added to 5 × 106 P-selectin-coated RBCs. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, 500 μl of a 1:9 ratio of apiezon oil:dibutyl phthalate (Sigma) oil mixture was added into each sample, which was then centrifuged to separate the free 125I-labeled G1 from the cells. Radioactivity associated with the cell pellets was measured using a gamma counter. Specific binding of G1 was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding, which was determined by adding 50 times excess unlabeled G1, from total binding. All assays were performed in triplicate. The statistical significance of the difference between three-dimensional affinities for different molecular orientations or lengths was performed using the Student's t test.RESULTSBinding Is Specific—Binding was quantified by the adhesion frequency at sufficiently long contact time (t → ∞) in control experiments. As exemplified for binding of P-selectin-coated RBCs to PSGL-1-expressing HL-60 cells (Fig. 2), adhesion frequencies measured from the micropipette assay were mediated by specific selectin-ligand interactions, because they were present when the RBCs were coated with appropriate nonblocking anti-selectin mAbs to capture the corresponding soluble selectin constructs but were abolished when mismatched selectin constructs not recognized by the coated capturing mAbs or isotype-matched irrelevant mAbs were used (Fig. 2). In addition, binding was blocked by mAbs against PSGL-1 (PL1), P-selectin (G1), and by the calcium chelator EDTA. Binding specificity between P-selectin-coated RBCs and G1-coated RBCs, E-selectin-coated RBCs and HL-60 cells, and between RbIgG-coated RBCs and CD16A-expressing CHO cells were confirmed by similar experiments (data not shown).Fig. 2Binding specificity of P-selectin. RBCs coated with sPs via capturing mAb S12 (a) or via direct CrCl3 coupling (b) or with PLE via capturing mAb 1478 (c) adhered with high frequencies to PSGL-1-expressing HL-60 cells. Binding was abolished when the P-selectin construct (sPs or PLE) was substituted by an irrelevant E-selectin construct (sEs or ELE) that did not interact with the coated capturing mAbs or when the capturing mAb (S12 or 1478) was replaced by an irrelevant mIgG1. Adhesions were also blocked by the anti-PSGL-1 blocking mAb PL1, by the anti-P-selectin blocking mAb G1, and by the calcium chelator EDTA. Adhesion frequency for each condition was obtained by fitting the Pa versus t curves to Equation 1 and then setting t → ∞, where the curves were obtained from 4∼36 cell pairs with 100 contacts each cell pair. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Binding Curves Follow Simple Receptor-ligand Binding Kinetics—Dependence of adhesion frequency on contact duration was measured using the micropipette assay at contact times ranging from 0.25–10 s, as exemplified for P-selectin-coated RBCs interacting with HL-60 cells (Figs. 3, a and b;6, a and b). The adhesion probability, Pa, was obtained by removing the nonspecific adhesion frequency, Pn (dashed lines in Figs. 3, a and b; 6, a and b, obtained by fitting the directly measured nonspecific adhesion frequency to Eq. 1), from the directly measured total adhesion frequency, Pt, according to Pa = (Pt - Pn)/(1 - Pn) (30Zhu C. Williams T.E. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1850-1857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The data (points in Figs. 3, a and b; 6, a and b) exhibit the shape of typical binding curves, with a transient phase where Pa increased with t and a steady phase where Pa reached equilibrium. Equation 1 was used to fit each binding curve to obtain two parameters: kr0 and mlAcKa0 (if mr was known) or kr0 and AcKa0 (if both mr and ml were known). For each set of interacting molecules presented on the RBC surface at each orientation and length, the mean reverse rate and mean effective binding affinity were calculated from several pairs of kr0 and mlAcKa0 (or AcKa0) values that respectively best fitted several Pa versus t curves obtained by varying the densities of the receptors and/or ligands. The mean kr0 and mlAcKa0 (or AcKa0) values were then used, along with the corresponding mr and/or ml values measured from independent experiments, to predict each Pa versus t curve (solid lines in Figs. 3, a and b; 6, a and b). It is evident that the model fits the data well, imparting confidence in the estimated kinetic parameters.Fig. 3Binding curves and kinetics of uniformly or randomly oriented sPs. Adhesion probability was plotted against contact duration at different site densities of mr = 4.6, 2.4, and 1.2 μm-2 for uniformly oriented sPs (a), and 26 and 8.7 μm-2 for randomly oriented sPs (b), respectively. Experimental data (points), presented as the mean ± S.E. at each contact time and obtained from 27–33 cell pairs for each curve, were compared with the predictions (solid lines) calculated from Equation 1 using the averaged best-fit kinetic parameters and the corresponding mr values. The dashed line represents nonspecific binding, obtained by fitting Equation 1 to the nonspecific data (23 and 28 data points in a and b, respectively, not shown for the sake of clarity). Mean ± S.D. of reverse rates, kr0, and effective binding affinities per unit site density of P-selectin, mlAcKa0, of uniformly (solid bars) and randomly (open bars) oriented sPs interacting with PSGL-1 are presented in c. p value indicates the level of statistical significance of differences in parameters corresponding to the two orientations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Binding curves and kinetics of long or short P-selectin"

We examined two aspects of myotube physiology, namely excitation-contraction and excitation-secretion coupling. Our results show that upon activation of the ryanodine receptor (RYR), myotubes release interleukin-6 (IL-6); this was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and could be blocked by dantrolene and cyclosporine. Myotubes from the two patients affected by central core disease showed a 4-fold increase in the release of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, compared with cells derived from control or malignant hyperthermia susceptible individuals. All tested myotubes released calcium from intracellular stores upon stimulation via surface membrane depolarization or direct RYR activation by 4-chloro-m-cresol. The functional impact on calcium release of RYR1 mutations linked to central core disease or malignant hyperthermia is different: human myotubes carrying the malignant hyperthermia-linked RYR1 mutation V2168M had a shift in their sensitivity to the RYR agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol to lower concentrations, whereas human myotubes harboring C-terminal mutations linked to central core disease exhibited reduced [Ca2+]i increase in response to 4-chloro-m-cresol, caffeine, and KCl. Taken together, these results suggest that abnormal release of calcium via mutated RYR enhances the production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, which may in turn affect signaling pathways responsible for the trophic status of muscle fibers.

Affected individuals often present with infantile hypotonia (floppy infant syndrome), weakness, hip dislocation, and a delay in achieving motor milestones. Later in life, the predominant symptom is a generalized muscle weakness affecting the proximal muscle groups more than the distal ones. The clinical severity is highly variable, but disease course is usually slow or nonprogressive (1Isaacs H. Heffron J.J. Badenhorst M. J. Neurol. Neurosurg.

On the basis of clinical findings alone the diagnosis is difficult, and a histological examination of muscle tissue is essential. Typically, type I fibers are predominant and contain well demarcated and centrally located cores, which lack mitochondria and do not stain with histochemical dyes for oxidative enzymes. In longitudinal sections the core area is extensive and covers a considerable length of the fiber (4Greenfield J.G. Cornman T. Shy G.M.

From a molecular point of view CCD is closely associated with malignant hyperthermia (MH), because both disorders are caused by mutations in the ryanodine receptor (RYR1), the calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. MH is a pharmacogenetic disease triggered by volatile anesthetics and the depolarizing muscle relaxant suxamethonium in predisposed (MH-susceptible (MHS)) individuals (7Denborough M.

The clinical signs of an impending MH reaction are due to a hypermetabolic state and include muscle rigidity, metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, tachycardia, and/or an increase in body temperature. Histological examination of muscle fibers from MHS individuals does not reveal alterations of the status of the muscle. To date more than 40 mutations have been identified in the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1, human chromosome 19q13.1) and are associated with MH and/or CCD (for review see Refs. 9MacLennan D.H.

To understand the molecular mechanism underlying MH and CCD, it is essential to evaluate the impact of mutations on the functional properties of the RYR calcium channels and on excitation-contraction coupling.

Physiol. 2003; 121: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, the impact of most disease-causing RYR1 mutations will necessarily affect calcium homeostasis of the muscle cell. To date, however, only few downstream effects of the altered intracellular calcium homeostasis have been investigated. Calcium-dependent pathways regulate many aspects of muscle physiology, including growth and regeneration (28Delling U. Tureckova J. Lim H.W. DeWindt L.J. Rotwein P. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6600-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 29Constantin B. Cognard C. Raymond G. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Increases in [Ca2+]i have been shown to activate transcription of the pro-inflammatory regulators nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) via activation of the calcium sensitive-phosphatase calcineurin (30McKay I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle cells are capable of producing and responding to several cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-15, and tumor necrosis factor (31Horsley V. Jansen K.M. Mills S.T. Pavlath G.K. Cell. 2003; 113: 483-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 32Febbraio M. Pedersen B.K.

Although the fine mechanism controlling cytokine release is not fully understood, muscle exercise has been shown to increase the plasma concentration of IL-6, which in turn has been proposed to exert a role on the maintenance of glucose homeostasis, its full physiological role, however, has yet to be established (for review see Ref. 32Febbraio M. Pedersen B.K. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1335-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). When released in large quantities, IL-6 and IL-1 cause fever; i.e. they constitute an endogenous pyrogen and can induce the synthesis of acute phase plasma proteins and initiate metabolic wasting (35Gelfand J.A. Dinarello C.A. Braunwald E. Fauci A.S. Kasper D.L. Hauser S.L. Longo D.L. Jameson J.L. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 15th Ed. McGraw Hill Inc., New York2001: 90-94Google Scholar). Because the mechanism underlying CCD appears to be controversial, in the present report we examined how two endogenously expressed CCD-linked RYR1 mutations affect [Ca2+]i homeostasis and cytokine release from cultured human myotubes and compared their properties to those of myotubes from control individuals or MHS individuals carrying a RYR1 mutation in a different domain of the calcium release channel. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose, penicillin G, streptomycin, were all purchased from Invitrogen. Insulin was purchased from Eli Lilly and Co. (Indianapolis, IN). Cell culture plastic ware was from BD Biosciences. Glutamine, HEPES, bovine serum albumin, epidermal growth factor, cycloheximide, anti-α-actinin, anti-goat-FITC, anti-mouse-cy3, creatine, and dantrolene were from Sigma. Fura-2/AM and cyclosporine A were from Calbiochem. The calcium calibration kit was from Molecular Probes, Inc. A goat anti-α1.1 subunit of the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor polyclonal antibodies was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. PeliKine-compact human IL-1β and IL-6 ELISA kits were from CLB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Mouse monoclonal antibody anti-IL-6R (CD130) was from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). All other chemicals were reagent or highest available grade. Patients, Identification of RYR1 Mutations, and Human Skeletal Muscle Cell Culture—Primary human muscle cell cultures were established after obtaining informed consent from muscle biopsies of patients undergoing the in vitro contracture test for the diagnosis of MH susceptibility, in 10 control patients from 3 different families, 9 patients with a positive family history for MH in which the V2168M mutation in the RYR1 gene was identified (from 5 different families), and from 2 patients affected by CCD. In these patients, exons 98–103 of the RYR1 gene, the major mutation hot spot, were screened for mutations by single strand conformation analysis and direct sequencing as described previously (20Tilgen N. Zorzato F. Halliger-Keller B. Muntoni F. Sewry C. Palmucci L.M. Schneider C. Hauser E. Lehmann-Horn F. Muller C.R. Treves S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2879-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Human skeletal muscle cell cultures were established as previously described (22Censier K. Urwyler A. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To differentiate cells into myotubes, the medium was switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 0.15 mg/ml creatine, 5 ng/ml insulin, 200 mm glutamine, 600 ng/ml penicillin G and streptomycin, and 7 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (36Fischer-Lougheed J. Liu J.H. Espinos E. Mordasisi D. Bader C.R. Belin D. Bernheim L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Intracellular [Ca2+] Measurements—Cells were transferred onto glass coverslips (5 cm in diameter) and allowed to proliferate in growth medium until visible groups of >10 cells were formed. The medium was then switched to differentiation medium, and [Ca2+] measurements were performed 7–10 days later. The free cytosolic [Ca2+] was determined using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 as described (22Censier K. Urwyler A. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Coverslips were mounted onto a 37 °C thermostatted chamber, which was continuously perfused with Krebs Ringer medium; individual cells were stimulated with a 12-way 100-mm diameter quartz micromanifold computer-controlled microperfuser (ALA Scientific) as previously described (37Treves S. Pouliquin P. Moccagatta L. Zorzato F. Cell Calcium. 2001; 31: 1-12Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On-line (340 nm, 380 nm, and ratio) measurements were recorded using a fluorescent Axiovert S100 TV inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany) equipped with a ×20 water-immersion FLUAR objective (0.17 numerical aperture) with filters (BP 340/380, FT 425, and BP 500/530) and attached to a Hamamatsu multiformat charge-coupled device camera. The cells were analyzed using an Openlab imaging system, and the average pixel value for each cell was measured at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. Ca2+ calibration was performed following the instructions provided with the calcium calibration kit. Release of Cytokines—Human skeletal muscle cells were placed in the wells of a 24-microtiter plate and allowed to grow until visible aggregates of >10 cells were seen. The medium was then switched to differentiation medium for 7–10 days. On the day of the experiment the medium was changed, and cells were stimulated at 37 °C under the specified conditions. The amount of IL-1β or IL-6 released into the supernatant was determined by using the CLB PeliKine Compact indirect ELISA kit following the manufacturer's instructions. All tests were performed in duplicate. Immunofluorescence—Undifferentiated myoblasts, growing in growth medium or myotubes 7–10 days after being grown in differentiation medium, were rinsed, fixed in ice-cold methanol:acetone (1:1) for 20 min, and processed as previously described (22Censier K. Urwyler A. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was detected using a fluorescence Axiovert S100 TV inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany) equipped with a ×20 FLUAR objective and Zeiss filter sets (BP 475/40, FT 500, and BP 530/50; and BP 546, FT 560, and BP 575–640) for detection of FITC and Cy3 fluorescence, respectively. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test for paired samples when there were two groups and ANOVA for more than two groups. Origin computer program (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA) was used for statistical analysis and curve generation. RYR1 Mutation Analysis—RYR1 mutations of the nine MH patients have been identified and described earlier (38Girard T. Urwyler A. Censier K. Müller C.R. Zorzato F. Treves S. Hum. Mut. 2001; 18: 357-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the two patients diagnosed clinically and histologically as having CCD we screened exons 98–103 of the RYR1 gene by SCCA. We concentrated on this region, because it is part of the highly conserved hydrophobic C-terminal domain of the RYR1 protein and has been found to be a hot spot for CCD-linked mutations (19Monnier N. Romero N.B. Lerale J. Nivoche Y. Qi D. MacLennan D.H. Fardeau M. Lunardi J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2599-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 20Tilgen N. Zorzato F. Halliger-Keller B.

Aberrant bands were identified, and direct DNA sequencing confirmed the presence of mutations I4898T in patient CCD1 and of R4893W in patient CCD2. Differentiated Cultured Human Skeletal Muscle Cells Express Proteins Characteristic of Differentiated Skeletal Muscle—To demonstrate that under our experimental culture conditions human primary muscle cells differentiate sufficiently, we performed immunofluorescence studies. Fig. 1 shows the appearance of human myoblasts cultured under growth conditions (Fig. 1, A–E) or myotubes after 7–10 days of culture in differentiation medium (Fig. 1, F–J). The expression of cytoskeletal proteins specific for skeletal muscle was demonstrated using an anti-α-sarcomeric actinin mouse monoclonal antibody. This protein is expressed only in striated muscle cells and is used to identify cells or tissues of striated muscle lineage (39Goncharova E.J. Kam Z. Geiger B. Development. 1992; 114: 173-178PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 (B and G) shows the fluorescence pattern of cultured human muscle cells: undifferentiated myoblasts are immunonegative, while differentiated myotubes exhibit a fluorescent pattern that is compatible with that of a cytoskeletal protein. Fig. 1 (C–I) shows the immunofluorescent patterns obtained using anti-RYR1 (Fig. 1, C and H) and anti-α1.1 dihydropyridine antibodies (Fig. 1, D and I), confirming that myotubes express the two main protein components of skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling (40Fleischer S. Inui M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 41Rios E. Pizarro G. Physiol.

J. 2000; 78: 1349-1358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We also verified whether cultured muscle cells express the IL-6 receptor, because IL-6 is released in large quantities during intense muscle activity (32Febbraio M. Pedersen B.K. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1335-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Of interest, immature myoblasts did not express the IL-6 receptor (Fig. 1E), whereas differentiated cells were immunopositive (Fig. 1J). Activation of the RYR Leads to IL-6 Release from Cultured Human Myotubes—We next carried out experiments aimed at determining whether activation of the RYR leads to IL-6 release from cultured human myotubes. On the day of the experiment, differentiation medium was replaced with fresh differentiation medium containing no agonist or 4-chloro-m-cresol or caffeine. Cells from three control individuals were incubated at 37 °C for different time periods, and the amount of IL-6 released into the supernatant was determined by ELISA. Fig. 2 shows the time course of IL-6 release after treatment with 600 μm 4-chloro-m-cresol (Fig. 2A) and 10 mm caffeine (Fig. 2B). Maximal release was obtained 4–6 h after addition of either agonist, indicating that activation of the RYR most likely does not result in the release of pre-formed cytokine but stimulates activation of transcription and protein synthesis. The total amount of IL-6 released into the supernatant after 6 h of incubation of muscle cells from control individuals with 600 μm 4-chloro-m-cresol and 10 mm caffeine was 5.0 ± 0.7 and 7.5 ± 1.2 ng/106 cells, respectively. To verify that this IL-6 release was (i) dependent on protein synthesis and (ii) dependent on activation of the RYR1, we performed experiments on cells stimulated with 600 μm 4-chloro-m-cresol, which had been pre-treated with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis (3 μg/ml, 30 min) (43Balciunaite G. Keller M. Balciunaite E. Piali L. Zuklys S. Mathieu Y.D. Boyd R. Sussman D.J. Hollander G.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), dantrolene (20 μm, 30 min) (44Zhao F. Li P. Chen S.R. Louis C.F. Fruen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13810-13816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) to prevent activation of RYR, or cyclosporine (100 nm, 30 min) (45Santana L.F. Chase E.G. Votaw V.S. Nelson M.T. Greven R. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) to block calcium-dependent calcineurin activation of the transcription factor NF-AT. Pre-treatment with any of the three compounds resulted in a significant inhibition (>50%, p < 0.00001, Student's t test) of 4-chloro-m-cresol-activated IL-6 release (Fig. 2C). Background IL-6 release after 5 h of incubation of the myotubes at 37 °C in the absence of any RYR agonist was 31.3% ± 3.2 of the maximal release (mean ± S.E.; n = 6). Contrary to what was observed in lymphocytes (46Girard T. Cavagna D. Padovan E. Spagnoli G. Urwyler A. Zorzato F. Treves S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48077-48082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), treatment of human myotubes with 4-chloro-m-cresol or caffeine did not result in the release of significant amounts of IL-1 (<50 pg/106 cells). We next determined the dose-response curves of 4-chloro-m-cresol-induced and caffeine-induced IL-6 release from human myotubes obtained from control individuals. Fig. 3 shows that treatment of cells with either agonist resulted in the significant release of IL-6 (p < 0.0018; ANOVA). The release could be blocked by pre-treatment with 20 μm dantrolene. In cells from control individuals, the maximal release was obtained at a concentration of 300 μm 4-chloro-m-cresol and 10 mm caffeine: the mean (± S.E.) IL-6 released was 6.0 ± 1.1 ng/106 cells and 7.1 ± 1.1 ng/106 cells, respectively (Fig. 3, A and E). These results represent the mean of eight different experiments carried out on muscle cells from at least four different individuals. The amounts of IL-6 released by 10 mm caffeine or 300 μm 4-chloro-m-cresol were not significantly different (p = 0.497). Of interest, treatment with either agonist resulted in a larger amount (1.4-fold) of cytokine release compared with that obtained by treating the cells with 1 μm ionomycin (mean ± S.E.; IL-6 released was 5.3 ± 0.8 ng/106 cells; not shown). When the same experiment was performed on cells from MHS individuals carrying the RYR1 V2168M mutation, addition of 4-chloro-m-cresol and caffeine resulted in the significant release of IL-6 (p < 0.0001; ANOVA). Maximal release was obtained at a concentration of 75 μm 4-chloro-m-cresol and 10 mm caffeine: the mean (± S.E.) IL-6 released was 7.2 ± 1.3 ng/106 cells and 8.4 ± 1.3 ng/106 cells, respectively (Fig. 3, B and F). Pre-treatment of the cells with 20 μm dantrolene inhibited IL-6 release, whereas treatment with 1 μm ionomycin resulted in the release of 5.5 ± 0.8 ng/106 cells. Background release of IL-6 in the absence of added RYR agonist was similar in myotubes from control and MHS individuals (mean ± S.E.; release was 2.1 ± 0.5 and 2.99 ± 0.2 ng/106 cells, respectively). Fig. 3 (C, D, G, and H) summarize the results obtained when experiments were performed on myotubes from the CCD patients harboring the I4898T and R4893W RYR1 mutations. The presence of either mutation in the C-terminal region of RYR1 caused a significant increase in the background levels of IL-6 released in the absence of an exogenous pharmacological activator of the RYR: the mean (± S.E.) amount of IL-6 released was 8.7 ± 0.4 and 14.7 ± 2.4 ng/106 myotubes carrying the RYR1 I4898T and R4893W mutations, respectively (p < 0.0001, ANOVA; compared with the background release of myotubes from control individuals). This background release of IL-6 blunted the stimulatory effect of 4-chloro-m-cresol to myotubes from the CCD patient harboring the I4898T mutation; the release induced by 600 μm 4-chloro-m-cresol was inhibited by pre-treatment with 20 μm dantrolene (Student's t test p < 0.0012; Fig. 3C). On the other hand, addition of caffeine caused a significant increase in IL-6 release, compared with background release (p < 0.004; ANOVA, Fig. 3G). 4-chloro-m-cresol (figure 3 panel D) and caffeine (figure 3 panel H) induced IL-6 release in myotubes from the CCD patient harboring the R4893W mutation were not significantly different; pre-treatment of these cells with 20 μm dantrolene, caused a significant reduction in IL-6 release by 600 μm 4-chloro-m-cresol (Student's t test p < 0.007). [Ca2+]i Homeostasis in Cultured Human Myotubes Carrying RYR1 Mutations—We assessed the intracellular calcium homeostasis of myotubes from individuals carrying different mutations in RYR1 by studying: (i) resting myoplasmic free calcium concentration; (ii) KCl-induced (depolarization) calcium release and (iii) 4-chloro-m-cresol induced calcium release. All mutations caused a small but significant increase in the [Ca2+]i (Student's t test, p < 0.0001); the difference between the mean resting [Ca2+]i of muscle cells from control and RYR1-mutation bearing individuals was ∼13 nm. However no difference was found when comparing [Ca2+]i from muscle cells bearing the different RYR1 mutations (p = 0.937; ANOVA, Fig. 4). In the next series of experiments we determined whether cells carrying different RYR1 mutations respond differently to treatment with RYR1 agonists. Fig. 5 shows a representative single cell [Ca2+]i measurement experiment: addition of the agonists resulted in an increase in the myoplasmic [Ca2+]i, which varied in extent depending on the mutation present and agonist concentration used.

We show here that the complex can be activated for membrane binding of SNX9 and Dyn2 by incubation of cytosol in the presence of ATP. SNX9 was essential for Dyn2 recruitment, whereas the reverse was not the case. RNA interference experiments confirmed that SNX9 functions as a mediator of Dyn2 recruitment to membranes in cells. The 41-kDa component was identified as the glycolytic enzyme aldolase. Aldolase bound with high affinity to a tryptophan-containing acidic sequence in SNX9 located close to its Phox homology domain, thereby blocking the membrane binding activity of SNX9. Phosphorylation of SNX9 released aldolase from the native cytosolic complex and rendered SNX9 competent for membrane binding. The results suggest that SNX9-dependent recruitment of Dyn2 to the membrane is regulated by an interaction between SNX9 and aldolase.

The results suggest that SNX9-dependent recruitment of Dyn2 to the membrane is regulated by an interaction between SNX9 and aldolase. The dynamins are essential proteins in various vesicle-scission reactions in the cell. In addition, they are implicated in several other processes, such as in signaling and actin dynamics (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar and 2Schafer D.A. Traffic. 2004; 5: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The best described process in which dynamin participates is the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the cell surface. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is characterized by discrete molecular events occurring at the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, leading to the sequestration of ligands from the cell surface (for reviews see Refs. 3Slepnev V.I.

Subsequently, in a dynamin-dependent process the neck of the bud is constricted, and the vesicle is released from the membrane. The events appear to be strictly coordinated and regulated to ensure directionality in the process.Dynamin is a large GTPase that in its GTP-bound state has the property of self-assembly, which in vitro results in the formation of rings and spirals (6Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 7Zhang P. Hinshaw J.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the presence of membranes, purified dynamin forms coat-like structures able to spontaneously deform the membrane into tubules (8Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E.

A pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is responsible for interactions with phosphoinositides in the lipid bilayer. At the carboxyl terminus a proline-rich domain (PRD) is located, which is the target for a number of Src homology 3 (SH3)-containing proteins proposed to aid in the function of dynamin (10Schmid S.L.

Despite its importance, surprisingly little is known about how dynamin is targeted to the site of action. It is believed that the lipid interaction of the PH domain is too weak to alone be responsible for the initial recruitment of dynamin from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (13Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Instead, this interaction may come into play after oligomerization of dynamin already at the membrane (14Klein D.E. Lee A.

SNX9 has binding sites for both clathrin and AP-2 in a low complexity region and binds Dyn2 by an SH3 domain in the amino terminus. SNX9 has its own membrane binding activity, mediated by a carboxyl-terminal region containing a Phox homology (PX) domain and a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain (22Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol.

Endogenous SNX9 was found to partially co-localize with AP-2 and Dyn2 at the plasma membrane, and overexpression in K562 and HeLa cells of truncated versions of SNX9 inhibited the uptake of transferrin (22Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46772-46781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).In the cytosol of K562 cells, most of SNX9 was found to be present in a native complex together with Dyn2 and an unidentified protein of 41 kDa (22Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46772-46781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to explore the role of this complex and to investigate if the membrane recruitment of SNX9 and Dyn2 is coordinated. We show that SNX9 mediates the targeting of Dyn2 to the membrane, and we present evidence that the membrane binding activity of SNX9 is regulated by a reversible interaction with the glycolytic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Anti-GST antibodies were generated by immunizing a rabbit with recombinant GST, and the serum was affinity-purified by using immobilized antigen. Goat anti-aldolase was from Chemicon International. Mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Secondary reagents used in immunofluorescence were Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies and Alexa Fluor 568-labeled anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes).

Immunodepleted cytosols were obtained after incubation with immobilized antibodies, and after a brief centrifugation the supernatants were collected.Fig. 4Identification of aldolase as a component of the SNX9-Dyn2 complex and analysis of its binding specificity.A, cytosols (1 mg of protein) prepared from K562 cells and HeLa cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against SNX9 or with preimmune IgG. After SDS-PAGE, the presence of Dyn2, SNX9, and aldolase was detected by immunoblotting. B, depiction of recombinant constructs used in the present investigation. All constructs were expressed as fusion proteins with GST located amino terminally. At bottom is shown the amino acid sequence of the region in SNX9 designated LC4. Tryptophans found to be important for binding of aldolase are in boldface type. Acidic residues (see “Discussion”) are underlined. C–E, K562 cytosol (20 mg/ml) (C) or purified aldolase (0.25 μm)(D and E) was incubated on ice with immobilized GST fusion proteins or with GST alone, and bound aldolase was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. LC-S165/S169 is a mutant of LC in which tryptophan at position 165 and 169 were changed to serines. E, GST-SNX9 was incubated with aldolase in the presence of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), or without additions (–). All additives were at 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Recombinant full-length and parts of SNX9 expressed as GST fusion proteins were as described (22Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J.

The cell pellet was washed and incubated on ice for 1–2 h in 15 ml of KSHM buffer. The cells were finally pelleted and resuspended at 50 × 106 cells/ml in KSHM buffer containing 0.8% BSA. The cells were >99% permeabilized as judged by trypan blue staining.Recruitment reactions were performed in a total volume of 40 μl of cytosol (final concentration 5 mg/ml), and when used ATP (1 mm) and an ATP-generating mixture (8 mm creatine phosphate and 50 μg/ml creatine kinase), GTPγS (100 μm), sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), and other additions as indicated in the figure legends were adjusted to 30 μl with KSHM buffer and mixed on ice. When no cytosol was used, the reactions were supplemented with BSA to the same protein concentration. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP was used at 1 mm. Cells (0.5 × 106) were added in 10 μl, and the reactions were started by transferring the tubes to a 37 °C water bath or kept on ice. After incubation for 20 min, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, rinsed with 200 μl of KSHM buffer without resuspension, and again centrifuged. The pellets were solubilized in 25 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, and after centrifugation the supernatants were prepared for SDS-PAGE.Liposomes were prepared by sonication as described (22Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46772-46781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Liposomes (50 nmol of lipid in 10 μl of KSHM buffer) were added to 30 μl of KSHM buffer containing either GST fusion protein in 0.5 mg/ml BSA or cytosol (5 mg/ml) with additions as indicated in the figure legends. After incubation at 37 °C or on ice for 20 min, the liposomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min. Liposomes were rinsed with 200 μl of KSHM buffer, centrifuged, and finally prepared for SDS-PAGE.Phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP—SNX9 was enriched from cytosol by velocity sedimentation (22Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46772-46781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Reactions with liposomes were performed as above in the presence of 0.2 MBq of [γ-32P]ATP. After washings, liposomes were solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS containing 1 mm orthovanadate, and SNX9 was immunoprecipitated. Immunoprecipitates were washed using high stringency conditions with buffers containing SDS/Nonidet P-40 and high salt (25Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12779-12786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the experiment shown in Fig. 6B, the reaction was performed without liposomes, and the immunoprecipitates were washed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4.Fig. 6Phosphorylation of SNX9 correlates with the release of aldolase.A, high molecular weight fraction from cytosol enriched for SNX9 was incubated with phosphoinositide-containing liposomes (composition as in Fig. 2B) at 37 °C for 20 min in the presence of a small amount of cytosol (0.5 mg/ml), ATP, [γ-32P]ATP, GTPγS, and orthovanadate. After washings, liposomes were solubilized in detergent and subjected to immunoprecipitation. The material was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the dried gel was exposed to x-ray film. B, the SNX9-enriched cytosol fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-SNX9 antibodies either directly (Before activation) or after incubation for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of ATP, [γ-32P]ATP, GTPγS, and orthovanadate (After activation). Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter, which was first subjected to autoradiography and then analyzed for the presence of SNX9 and aldolase by immunoblotting. C, immobilized GST or GST-SNX9 was incubated for 20 min with cytosol (20 mg/ml) on ice or at 37 °C in the presence of ATP and an ATP-regenerating mixture, or with AMP-PNP as indicated. After washings, aldolase bound to the beads was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. D, immobilized GST fusion proteins (500 ng), or GST alone, were incubated with cytosol (2 mg/ml), ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 37 °C. After washings, the fusion proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter, and subjected to autoradiography followed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibodies. The same exposures are shown for all immunoblot and autoradiography insets, respectively. E, cytosol (5 mg/ml) was incubated on ice together with kinase inhibitors staurosporine (20 μm), 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) (200 μm), herbimycin A (100 μm), genistein (400 μm), and 5′-(4-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl)-adenosine (FSBA)(1 mm), or without inhibitor (–) in the presence of GTPγS and orthovanadate. After 2 h, permeabilized K562 cells were added together with ATP and an ATP-regeneration mixture. The AMP-PNP sample was without ATP. The samples were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, and bound SNX9 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Phosphorylation of GST fusion proteins was performed after binding to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), by incubation for 20 min at 37 °C in 20 μl of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm magnesium acetate, 40 μg of cytosol, 1 mm ATP, and 0.06 MBq of [γ-32P]ATP. Beads were washed in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS and prepared for SDS-PAGE.siRNA Knockdowns—HeLa cells were transfected twice with small interfering RNA (siRNA) and cultured essentially as described by Motley et al. (26Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), except that each transfection was scaled down 4-fold. Six hours prior to analysis at day 3, cells were trypsinized and plated on 35-mm dishes or on coverslips for immunofluorescence studies. For the latter experiments, transfected cells were mixed with control cells to facilitate analysis and viewed using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. To assay the efficiency of transfection, cells from 35-mm dishes were trypsinized, washed, and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS containing protease inhibitors and analyzed by immunoblotting. For analysis of membrane-bound and cytosolic pools of Dyn2, trypsinized cells from 50-mm dishes were washed, and cytosol and a 70,000 × g pellet (membranes) were prepared after a freeze/thaw-cycle as described (22Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46772-46781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and analyzed by immunoblotting.Two independent siRNAs were used to knock down the expression of SNX9. The SNX9a target was AAGAGAGUCAGCAUCAUGUCU and the SNX9b target was AACCUACUAACACUAAUCGAU. As a control we used a scrambled version of the SNX9a sequence (UAGGUACUCUGAGCAGAUC). The siRNAs were synthesized as option C siRNAs by Dharmacon, Inc., or by a similar protocol by Thermo Electron Corp.RESULTSWe first tested the membrane binding activity of cytosolic SNX9 and Dyn2 by incubations with permeabilized and washed K562 cells, followed by detection of bound SNX9 and Dyn2 by immunoblotting. The results in Fig. 1A show that SNX9 in cytosol required incubation at 37 °C in the presence of ATP for efficient binding, whereas incubation on ice resulted in much less cell-associated SNX9. In addition to ATP and heat, GTPγS and orthovanadate were required for full activity, and the omission of one these reagents gave intermediate binding. Under optimal conditions, essentially 100% of SNX9 was bound to the membranes. Dyn2 followed the binding pattern of SNX9 in terms of conditions, with the exception that Dyn2 had an absolute requirement for GTPγS. At maximum, ∼25% of Dyn2 bound to the membranes. This figure fits with the estimated proportion of cytosolic Dyn2 that is in complex with SNX9 (22Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46772-46781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Fig. 1Recruitment of SNX9 and Dyn2 to permeabilized cells. K562 cells were permeabilized by freezing/thawing, and the cytosol was washed out. Cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, or on ice, under various conditions as indicated. After washings, the cells were analyzed for bound SNX9 and Dyn2 by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. A, requirements for binding of proteins from cytosol. Cytosol (5 mg/ml), or BSA as a control, was mixed with indicated reagents. The lane marked by * shows the direct analysis of 25% of cytosol added to the samples. B, requirements for binding of recombinant SNX9. Samples were incubated with purified GST-SNX9 (800 ng), with or without cells and indicated reagents, in the presence of BSA. C, immunodepleted cytosols (5 mg/ml), with or without added recombinant GST fusion proteins (800 ng) as indicated, were incubated at 37 °C together with ATP, GTPγS, orthovanadate, and permeabilized cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because SNX9 is present in cytosol as a complex, it was of interest to see how purified, recombinant SNX9 behaved when added to cell membranes. Fig. 1B shows that purified GST-SNX9 bound to cell membranes and that the binding did not require incubation at 37 °C or ATP or any of the other factors that was obligate for cytosolic SNX9. This finding indicates that the resting complex of SNX9 in the cytosol is inactive for membrane binding because of the lack of an exposed membrane-binding site. It also shows that the incubation with cytosol has no crucial influence on the properties of the membrane itself for binding of SNX9.To investigate if the membrane binding activities of SNX9 and Dyn2 are linked, cytosol was separately immunodepleted of SNX9 and Dyn2, or mock-depleted, and used in the recruitment assay. Although most of SNX9 is present in complex with Dyn2 in the cytosol, in the immunodepletion procedure substantial amounts of SNX9 are left behind in the cytosol after removal of Dyn2. This is due to the fact that the complex is labile and partly dissociates, especially when incubated with antibodies against Dyn2 (22Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46772-46781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This allows for analysis of the recruitment dependence on the immunodepleted protein. As seen in Fig. 1C, Dyn2 depletion had no major effect on the binding of SNX9 to membranes, whereas SNX9 was necessary for the binding of Dyn2. Because we had found that purified SNX9 can bind Dyn2 in the cytosol (22Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46772-46781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), it was of interest to see if SNX9-depleted cytosol can be reconstituted with purified SNX9 for the binding of Dyn2 to membranes. Fig. 1C shows that full-length GST-SNX9, but not a variant that lacks the membrane-binding part (GST-SH3LC), can efficiently reconstitute the binding of Dyn2 to membranes. The combined results show that Dyn2 is recruited to the membrane through its interaction with SNX9 and that the membrane binding activity resides in the SNX9 molecule.If the binding of cytosolic SNX9 to membranes is mediated through a PX/BAR domain-lipid interaction, as found previously for purified SNX9 (22Lundmark R. Carlsson S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46772-46781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the binding experiments should be possible to perform with pure lipids. Two different liposome preparations, one containing PC and PI (denoted PI) and one that in addition contained a mixture of phosphoinositides (denoted PIP), were incubated with cytosol on ice and/or at 37 °C together with ATP, GTPγS, and orthovanadate (Fig. 2A). Cytosolic SNX9 showed very little binding to liposomes when incubated on ice (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2), in agreement with the results using cell membranes (see Fig. 1A). When incubated at 37 °C, extensive binding of SNX9 occurred (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), especially with liposomes containing phosphatidylinositols (lane 4). To see if this effect was because of modifications in the cytosol or on the membranes, the cytosol was first incubated at 37 °C and then mixed with liposomes and incubated on ice (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). The result shows that a major effect of the incubation at 37 °C is on the cytosol (Fig. 2A, compare lane 4 with lanes 2 and 6). This result shows again that the SNX9 complex in cytosol requires an activation step to expose the binding site for membranes (i.e. phosphoinositides). In addition to this effect, it appears that factors in the cytosol to some extent can modify the liposomes to become binders for activated SNX9 (Fig. 2A, compare lane 3 with lanes 1 and 5).Fig. 2Recruitment of cytosolic SNX9 and Dyn2 to liposomes.A, temperature and phosphoinositide requirements. Two different liposome preparations were incubated with ATP, GTPγS, and orthovanadate for 20 min at 37 °C, or on ice, together with normal cytosol or SNX9-depleted cytosol (5 mg/ml). One sample contained in addition 800 ng of GST-SNX9. Two samples (denoted by *) were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C before the addition of liposomes and were then incubated for another 20 min on ice. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Liposomes denoted PI contained 50% PC and 50% PI, and liposomes denoted PIP contained 50% PC and 50% of an equal mixture of PI, PI(3)P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(4,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3. B, nucleotide and orthovanadate requirements. Cytosol (5 mg/ml) and indicated reagents were incubated with liposomes, or without liposomes, for 20 min at 37 °C or on ice. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The lane marked by * shows the direct analysis of 25% of cytosol added to the samples. Liposomes contained 50% PC, 40% PI, and 10% of an equal mixture of the same phosphoinositides as in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cytosolic Dyn2 showed the same binding pattern to liposomes as SNX9 did (Fig. 2A), again arguing for the dependence of SNX9 for membrane binding of Dyn2. To test directly for this in the liposome system, we incubated phosphoinositide-containing liposomes with SNX9-depleted cytosol, with or without the addition of purified GST-SNX9 (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). The results clearly show that Dyn2 binds to liposomes only if SNX9 is present, establishing a role for SNX9 as a molecule that links Dyn2 to phosphoinositide membranes. The nucleotide and orthovanadate requirements for the activation step of the SNX9-Dyn2 complex in cytosol were confirmed in the liposome assay (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, replacing ATP with AMP-PNP in the mixture showed that both SNX9 and Dyn2 required ATP hydrolysis for efficient binding to the liposomes.The importance of SNX9 for the localization of Dyn2 in living cells was tested by RNA interference experiments in HeLa cells.

Integrins are heterodimeric (αβ) cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion receptors, with each subunit containing a large extracellular domain, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). Integrins are often expressed on the cell surface in an inactive state (unable to bind physiologic ligands) but can be rapidly activated by intracellular signals (inside-out activation) (2Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Blood. 2003; 102: 1155-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Once liganded, integrins cluster and initiate outside-in signals similar to classical receptors that modify cellular functions. The precise mechanism of integrin activation is incompletely understood. Insights into structure-activity relationships in integrins were greatly aided by our determination of the crystal structure of the ectodomain from integrin αVβ3 alone and in complex with the prototypical ligand RGD (3Xiong J.P.

An unexpected feature of the crystal structure is that αVβ3 is genuflexed at the αV and β3 “knees” such that the head abuts the legs. Current models suggest that a straightening of the genu is required for physiologic ligand binding (in the switch-blade model of activation (6Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar)) or for ligand-induced outside-in signaling (in the deadbolt model (2Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Blood. 2003; 102: 1155-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar)). A better understanding of the basis of integrin activation requires structure determination of the activation-sensitive domains PSI, EGF1, and EGF2 (reviewed in Ref. 7Arnaout M.A. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which are all located in the genuflexed β-subunit but were not resolved in the published structure. Although some features of the PSI domain, including two short helices, were visible in our electron density maps, our main chain tracing was inconsistent with published cysteine pairing (8Calvete J.J. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and predictions (5Bork P. Doerks T. Springer T.A. Snel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 261-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) especially between Cys5 and Cys435. Since several cysteines cluster close together, we were initially unable to build the domain with certainty. The density for EGF1 and EGF2 was even less well defined. The ∼50-amino acid PSI domain, first recognized based on primary sequence alignments, is present in one or more copies in more than 500 proteins (see smart.embl-heidelberg.de/smart/get_members.pl?WHAT=NRDB_COUNT&NAME=PSI). It is most commonly found in plexins, semaphorins, and integrins, glycoproteins that mediate cell growth, migration, and differentiation. Two recently determined structures of semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) (9Love C.A. Harlos K. Mavaddat N. Davis S.J. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Esnouf R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and the plexin MET (10Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), each containing a PSI domain, have now allowed us to build the integrin PSI domain into our αVβ3 maps without ambiguity. The salient and unexpected features of this structure as it relates to integrin architecture, activation, and disease are presented and discussed here. The original αVβ3 structure was determined using a combined phasing approach, with a lutetium derivative data set used for multiple anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing and a platinum data set used for single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) (3Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). To solve the PSI structure, three maps were calculated: a MAD-phased map, a SIRAS-phased map based on the platinum derivative, and another SIRAS-phased map based on the lutetium data set collected at the peak wavelength. The three electron density maps were averaged using the RAVE package (11Kleywegt G.J. Bergfors T. Senn H. Le Motte P. Gsell B. Shudo K. Jones T.A. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 1241-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and displayed using program O (12Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The averaged map showed clear density for a large portion of the PSI domain, including two helices and the central tryptophan residue (Trp25), allowing us to trace the PSI chain. The new model for αVβ3, including the PSI domain, was refined using the existing 3.1-Å data set (3Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar) and the program CNS (13Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This resulted in R-factors of 29.0 (work set) and 35.6% (free set) and good model geometry. Structure Determination of the Integrin PSI—Our initial chain trace of the PSI did not agree with the published cysteine pairing, especially between Cys5 and Cys435. However, the recent structure determinations of two PSI domains (9Love C.A. Harlos K. Mavaddat N. Davis S.J. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Esnouf R.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 10Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), allowed us to establish the β3 PSI fold without ambiguity (Fig. 1A). We fitted the cysteine cores of SEMA4D and MET structures into our maps, and this allowed us to establish points of reference for the PSI domain fold. It became clear that Cys13, and not the published Cys5, pairs with Cys435 (Fig. 1B). It also became clear that the region around Cys435 substitutes for a portion of the PSI domain seen in the SEMA4D and MET structures, and thus Cys435 is integral to PSI. We were able to build residues 1–50 of the PSI domain by using the corrected disulfide bond pattern. The linker between PSI and hybrid domains (residues 51–53) is not well defined in our density maps and was not included. In our efforts to connect the PSI domain with the hybrid domain, we also noticed that the N-terminal strand of the hybrid domain was out of register by one residue. We have corrected this error, which has no bearing on previously published interpretations of αVβ3 structure and function. The location of the PSI domain in relation to the rest of the αVβ3 ectodomain is shown in Fig. 1C. Architecture of the Integrin PSI and Its Relationship to the Hybrid Domain—The integrin PSI domain forms a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, with two flanking short helices, connected by disulfides to the central sheet, and an N-terminal segment that may also be helical (Fig. 1B). The small hydrophobic core of the domain is formed by the highly conserved side chain of Trp25. The core integrin PSI structure can be largely superimposed onto those of SEMA4D and MET, including all three conserved cysteine pairs (Fig. 2, A and B). The fourth disulfide bridge is lacking in semaphorins and has a somewhat different conformation in plexins and integrins, perhaps a result of an additional C-terminal α-helix in the integrin PSI (Fig. 2, A and B). A key difference between the integrin PSI domain and the semaphorin and plexin PSI domains is a distinctively longer interstrand AB loop (Figs. 1B and 2B). While some of the side chains in this loop are solvent exposed, others may face the EGF2 domain, suggesting potential interactions. It is also apparent that the overall structures of the three PSI domains are quite different in the C-terminal half of the domain (Fig. 2, A and B). This suggests that this portion of PSI has a function defined by its specific structural context. Alignment of the PSI domains of SEMA4D, MET, and αVβ3 reveals that Cys435 of β3, located at the C terminus of the hybrid domain, is an integral part of the integrin PSI (Fig. 2A). Thus the hybrid domain is an insertion into the last loop of PSI. This unexpected architecture through which the PSI and hybrid domains are connected may explain the incorrect predictions of cysteine pairing of the PSI domain in integrins (5Bork P. Doerks T. Springer T.A. Snel B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 261-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 8Calvete J.J. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The hybrid A′B loop contains an arginine (Arg93), conserved between integrin β-chains, that contributes to the interface with the PSI domain. Functional and Disease Implications—The integrin PSI domain contributes to integrin activation as evidenced by binding of activation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies such as AP5 (which binds the N-terminal six amino acids of PSI of β3 (14Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R. Ruggeri Z. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)) and activating amino acid substitutions (15Zang Q. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6922-6929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Sun Q.H. Liu C.Y. Wang R. Paddock C. Newman P.J. Blood. 2002; 100: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) such as an alanine substitution of the Cys435, which is immediately N-terminal to EGF1 (Fig. 1B) (reviewed in Ref. 7Arnaout M.A. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The PSI domain also harbors clinically important alloantigens that cause immune thrombocytopenias. A leucine-proline dimorphism at amino acid 33 (Leu33 → Pro) known as autoantigen Pl(A) is the one most frequently implicated in syndromes of immune-mediated platelet destruction, particularly neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia and post-transfusion purpura. Substitution of the common PlA1 alloantigen at Leu33 with Pro (PlA2 allele found in 15% of Caucasians) may also predispose to arterial thrombosis frequently manifested as acute coronary events that can lead to sudden death at a relatively young age (17Weiss E.J. Bray P.F. Tayback M. Schulman S.P. Kickler T.S. Becker L.C. Weiss J.L. Gerstenblith G. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1090-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). It is suspected that this predisposition is secondary to enhanced activation of platelet integrins (18Bussel J.B. Kunicki T.J. Michelson A.D. Hematology (Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program). 2000; : 222-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), enhanced thrombin generation, and impaired antithrombotic action of aspirin at the site of microvascular injury (19Undas A. Brummel K. Musial J. Mann K.G. Szczeklik A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2666-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the PlA2 allele is a risk factor for acute renal allograft rejection (20Salido E. Martin B. Barrios Y. Linares J.D. Hernandez D. Cobos M. Checa M.D. Hortal L. Fernandez A. Garcia J.J. Torres A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2599-2605PubMed Google Scholar). The PSI domain also contributes to the binding of certain drugs that trigger drug-dependent antibodies to αIIbβ3, precipitating thrombocytopenia (21Peterson J.A. Nyree C.E. Newman P.J. Aster R.H. Blood. 2003; 101: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The present crystallographic studies clarify a number of observations about structure-activity relationships in integrins. First, they establish the correct pairing of cysteines and domain boundaries for the integrin PSI. This will allow a reinterpretation of many functional studies and will be invaluable in devising new ones to evaluate the salient features of the structure. Second, the structure reveals that the N terminus of the activation-sensitive AP5 epitope is solvent-exposed (Fig. 1B), which may explain the ability of the AP5 monoclonal antibody to bind the ectodomain in solution (not shown). The Cys13-Cys435 disulfide bridge contributes to the PSI/hybrid interface and likely helps to restrict movement of the PSI with respect to the hybrid domain. The activating effect of the Cys435 to alanine substitution is expected to make this interface more flexible, and it may also allosterically alter putative contacts between PSI and EGF1/2, thus accounting for the activating nature of this mutation. Interruption of the adjacent Cys406-Cys433 disulfide bond in the hybrid domain may have a similar functional outcome. Third, Leu33 is located in a hydrophobic segment of the distinctively long AB loop (between strands A and B of the PSI domain, Fig. 1B). Its replacement with Pro, a conformationally restricted residue, may alter the structure of this loop leading to an autoantibody response and immune thrombocytopenia. Elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the PlA1 alloantigen may be useful in averting the autoimmune consumption of platelets through drug design. Of note is that Leu33 is located in the AB loop that likely faces EGF2; its replacement with Pro may also alter this interface and promote integrin activation. Fourth, three quinine-dependent antibodies known to cause the precipitous destruction of platelets if a patient is exposed to the drug require a conformational epitope in the PSI, which includes Ala50 (Fig. 1B) and Arg62 and Asp66 in the first strand of the hybrid domain of β3. The present structure reveals that all three residues are located on the same side of the integrin. Finally, it is now apparent that two insertions have contributed to the current architecture of the integrin β-subunit, one in the last loop of PSI and the second in between the two sheets of the hybrid domain, setting the stage both for formation of the integrin heterodimer and its regulated ability to bind physiologic ligands."

Transitions in chromatin architecture, through alterations in its composition and modification markings, characterize early development. A variant of the H2A core histone, H2A.Z, is essential for development of both Drosophila and mice. We recently showed that H2A.Z is required for proper chromosome segregation. Whether H2A.Z has additional specific functions during early development remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that depletion of H2A.Z by RNA interference perturbs Xenopus laevis development at gastrulation leading to embryos with malformed, shortened trunks. Consistent with this result, whole embryo in situ hybridization indicates that endogenous expression of H2A.Z is highly enriched in the notochord. H2A.Z modifies the surface of a canonical nucleosome by creating an extended acidic patch and a metal ion-binding site stabilized by two histidine residues. To examine the significance of these specific surface regions in vivo, we investigated the consequences of overexpressing H2A.Z and mutant proteins during X. laevis development. Overexpression of H2A.Z slowed development following gastrulation. Altering the extended acidic patch of H2A.Z reversed this effect. Remarkably, modification of a single stabilizing histidine residue located on the exposed surface of an H2A.Z containing nucleosome was sufficient to disrupt normal trunk formation mimicking the effect observed by RNA interference.

Variant histones have been identified in all eukaryotes and evidence exists that they define specialized functional domains within the genome. At the centromere, for example, the core histone H3 is replaced by the centromere protein A (CENP-A) variant to impart a unique structure to centromeric chromatin (1Sullivan K.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A number of H2A variants have been described at defined locations in the genome: H2A.X at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (2Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar), H2A-Bbd deficient from the Barr body (3Chadwick B.P. Willard H.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and macroH2A on the mammalian inactive X chromosome (4Costanzi C. Stein P. Worrad D.M. Schultz R.M. Pehrson J.R. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 2283-2289PubMed Google Scholar). H2A.Z histone variant is highly conserved suggesting an important role; however, to date, defining the function and localization of H2A.Z has remained elusive. The first hypothesis, derived from its preferential localization in Tetrahymena to the transcriptionally active macronucleus and the micronucleus during a brief transcriptional period prior to conjugation, proposed that H2A.Z has a role in the activation of transcription (5Allis C.D. Glover C.V. Bowen J.K. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1980; 20: 609-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 6Allis C.D. Ziegler Y.S. Gorovsky M.A. Olmsted J.B. Cell. 1982; 31: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, H2A.Z was suggested to be necessary for gene activation at the PHO5 and GAL1 promoters in cooperation with a chromatin remodelling factor (7Santisteban M.S. Kalashnikova T. Smith M.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). On the other hand, others suggested that H2A.Z was involved in gene silencing at telomeres and the HMR locus (8Dhillon N. Kamakaka R.T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). More recently it was shown that H2A.Z containing chromatin may act as a buffer between active and inactive regions by structurally altering chromatin to prevent the spreading of silencing factors (9Meneghini M.D. Wu M. Madhani H.D. Cell. 2003; 112: 725-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Although these investigations have defined a role for H2A.Z in the transcription of some genes in yeast, it is important to note that in budding yeast H2A.Z is not essential. We propose that H2A.Z has additional roles in higher eukaryotes. A role at constitutive heterochromatin is indicated by the enrichment of H2A.Z at pericentric heterochromatin, with heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α), in early mouse extra-embryonic cells (10Rangasamy D. Berven L. Ridgway P. Tremethick D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1599-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Importantly, a reduction in H2A.Z expression in mammalian tissue culture cells by RNAi 1The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; MBT, midblastula transition; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP.1The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; MBT, midblastula transition; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. leads to a loss in heterochromatin stability and abnormal chromosome segregation (11Rangasamy D. Greaves I. Tremethick D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 650-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, deletion of the H2A.Z gene in fisson yeast Saccharomyces pombe results in genome instability (12Carr A.M. Dorrington S.M. Hindley J. Phear G.A. Aves S.J. Nurse P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). H2A.Z may have additional specific functions during early development. Loss of H2A.Z in Drosophila and mice is lethal with the defect occurring early in embryonic development (13van Daal A. Elgin S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Clarkson M.J. Wells J.R. Gibson F. Saint R. Tremethick D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 15Faast R. Thonglairoam V. Schulz T.C. Beall J. Wells J.R. Taylor H. Matthaei K. Rathjen P.D. Tremethick D.J. Lyons I. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1183-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Subsequent investigation during mouse blastocyst outgrowth revealed that the localization and expression pattern of H2A.Z differed in early cell lineages (10Rangasamy D. Berven L. Ridgway P. Tremethick D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1599-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of the H2A.Z gene promoter in human embryonal carcinoma cells identified an element that regulates its expression during differentiation suggesting that H2A.Z may be acting at defined stages of cell specialization (16Hatch C.L. Bonner W.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1305: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, H2A.Z may also have a specific role in the development of certain tissues. Xenopus laevis is an ideal system to investigate the role of chromatin in regulating early developmental events. On fertilization, the activated X. laevis egg undergoes a global transcriptional silencing for 12 cleavage divisions until the midblastula transition (MBT) when embryonic transcription commences (17Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 675-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar, 18Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). It appears that this early silencing is maintained by vast pools of maternal histones, which inhibit the formation of the basal transcriptional machinery and translation (19Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1752-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Prioleau M.N. Huet J. Sentenac A. Mechali M. Cell. 1994; 77: 439-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Histone variants of the H1 linker histone have been reported to specifically control embryonic gene expression patterns in X. laevis. The accumulation of somatic H1 linker histone regulates the loss of mesodermal competence during gastrulation (21Steinbach O.C. Wolffe A.P. Rupp R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 22Vermaak D. Steinbach O.C. Dimitrov S. Rupp R.A. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 533-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and overexpression of somatic H1, but not the maternal H1 linker variant B4, reduces mesoderm-specific myoD induction (21Steinbach O.C. Wolffe A.P. Rupp R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, evidence suggests that general chromatin components are involved in pattern formation processes during early X. laevis development. Interestingly, and in contrast to early mouse development (15Faast R. Thonglairoam V. Schulz T.C. Beall J. Wells J.R. Taylor H. Matthaei K. Rathjen P.D. Tremethick D.J. Lyons I. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1183-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), Xenopus H2A.Z is expressed at a low level during early development, 2K. Brown, personal communication.2K. Brown, personal communication. but its expression increases and peaks at gastrulation (23Iouzalen N. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3947-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Previously we used H2A to H2A.Z domain swap experiments in Drosophila to identify a region in the H2A.Z C terminus, the docking domain, as being essential for development in flies (14Clarkson M.J. Wells J.R. Gibson F. Saint R. Tremethick D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The docking domain stabilizes the interaction between the H2A/H2B dimer and the H3/H4 tetramer and makes a significant contribution to the nucleosomal surface. The crystal structure of an H2A.Z containing nucleosome showed that the major difference from a canonical nucleosome is an altered surface due to amino acid changes in the docking domain. Interestingly, one major difference was two histidine residues that bound a metal ion and are indicative of a protein/protein interaction interface (24Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Our objective in this investigation was to determine whether H2A.Z has a specific developmental role and to define the essential amino acid residues in H2A.Z required for such a function. DNA Constructs—To express wild-type murine H2A, wild-type murine H2A.Z, or H2A.Z with alterations to specific amino acid residues, H2A.Z cDNA fragments were generated by PCR and subcloned into the RNA expression vector pβGFP/RN3 (25Zernicka-Goetz M. Pines J. Ryan K. Siemering K.R. Haseloff J. Evans M.J. Gurdon J.B. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3719-3724PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations to the wild-type H2A.Z sequence were made to produce the following H2A.Z derivatives: H2A.ZNQ (the two evolutionarily conserved histidine residues at positions 112 and 114 changed to asparagine and glutamine residues, which are the identically positioned amino acid residues in H2A), H2A.ZNH (only one histidine at position 112 altered to asparagine), H2A.ZCS (the C-terminal α-helix of H2A.Z (amino acid residues swapped with the equivalent region of H2A), H2A.ZNK (two amino acid residues within the C-terminal α-helix of H2A.Z at amino acid positions 97 and 98 in H2A.Z changed from aspartic acid to asparagine and serine to lysine, respectively, to correspond to H2A residues at the same position), and H2A.Z/EGFP (wild-type H2A.Z fused at its C terminus to the EGFP cDNA as described previously (26Ridgway P. Rangasamy D. Berven L. Svensson U. Tremethick D.J. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar)). Embryo Culture and Microinjection—X. laevis embryos were obtained from in vitro fertilized eggs according to standard protocols (26Ridgway P. Rangasamy D. Berven L. Svensson U. Tremethick D.J. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Embryos were microinjected into the animal pole of one or both blastomeres at the two-cell stage of development with 1–10 ng of in vitro transcribed mRNA in a total volume of 9.2–27.6 nl using a nanoject injector (Drummond) depending on experimental demands and as described previously (19Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1752-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Synthetic annealed 21-bp H2A.Z RNAi (Ambion) (100 μm) was injected into each blastomere of a two-cell stage embryo in a volume of 27.6 nl. Staging of embryos was according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (27Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. 3rd Ed. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). In Vitro RNA Preparation and RNA Interference—RNA for microinjection was transcribed in vitro from cDNA using T3 RNA polymerase. The RNA was 5′-capped and contains stabilizing β-globin 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions specifically designed to maximize exogenous protein expression in X. laevis embryos (25Zernicka-Goetz M. Pines J. Ryan K. Siemering K.R. Haseloff J. Evans M.J. Gurdon J.B. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 3719-3724PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was purified and quantified by both electrophoresis and UV analysis and diluted to required concentrations in injection buffer as described previously (26Ridgway P. Rangasamy D. Berven L.

Reece-Hoyes J.S. Berghammer H. Dodd H. Hann S.J. Miller D.J. Ball E.E. Dev. Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) except without the use of xylene for removal of lipids or without the hydrolysis of probes given the short length of the RNA (28Sive H.L. Grainger R.M. Harland R.M. Early Development of Xenopus laevis: A Laboratory Mannual. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press, New York2000: 39-79Google Scholar). Probes were hybridized at 60 °C. The H2A.Z probe was an antisense RNA incorporating the whole translated region produced by the same in vitro technique used to produce mRNA for microinjection but with a digoxigenin-substituted ribonucleotide. Control embryos were treated in the same manner as the test embryos with the omission of probe. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) was used as the color substrate. Embryos were dehydrated with a series of glycerol solutions of increasing concentration and mounted in 70% glycerol. A Leica MZFL III microscope with the IM50 software was used for image capture. Depletion of H2A.Z Disrupts Embryo Development following Gastrulation—To determine whether H2A.Z is important for Xenopus development we chose two parallel complementary approaches to perturb H2A.Z activity. Endogenous H2A.Z function was disrupted using double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) and by a dominant-negative approach (see below). When RNAi complementary to Xenopus H2A.Z was microinjected into two blastomeres of a two-cell stage embryo over 35% of embryos displayed a specific defective phenotype (Fig. 1). The level of total H2A.Z mRNA was reduced by 20–30% in these embryos (determined by RT-PCR normalized to H4 mRNA levels) consistent with other reports of RNAi in Xenopus (30Nakano H. Amemiya S. Shiokawa K. Taira M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 31Zhou Y. Ching Y.P. Kok K.H. Kung H.F. Jin D.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1664-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The abnormal phenotype was first evident at gastrulation as a failure of the blastopore to close leading to embryos with shortened trunks and a malformed neural plate at the tailbud stage. This effect was specific, since neither mouse H2A.Z RNAi nor a scrambled RNAi produced a marked increase in defective embryos relative to uninjected controls (Fig. 1A). To confirm that the malformation was indeed attributed specifically to H2A.Z, we co-injected H2A.Z RNA in a series of rescue experiments (Fig. 1, B–F). Compared with control embryos that developed normally (Fig. 1B), over half of Xenopus H2A.Z RNAi-injected embryos displayed a gastrulation defect as illustrated in Fig. 1C. It is important to point out that embryo trunks were severely shortened and malformed, whereas the anterior head region appeared normal suggesting that specific tissues were affected. The percentage of malformed embryos was reduced following H2A.Z RNA co-injection, in a dose-dependant manner, to similar levels as those observed with injection of mouse or scrambled RNAi (∼10%; Fig. 1F). Not only were there fewer malformed embryos in the H2A.Z rescued embryos, but the malformations were generally less severe (Fig. 1, compare C with D and E). These experiments indicate that H2A.Z has a role in progression of Xenopus early development beyond gastrulation in specific tissues. Microinjected H2A.Z mRNA Is Expressed and in the Nucleus—We propose that macromolecular determinants located on the nucleosome surface play a fundamental role in controlling chromatin function. To identify specific molecular determinants located on the surface of an H2A.Z containing nucleosome that are required for normal development, we chose an overexpression strategy. First, to confirm that injected H2A.Z mRNA is expressed and nuclear an H2A.Z/EGFP fusion protein was used to visually monitor the expression of exogenous H2A.Z because levels of protein were too low for standard immunodetection. Fig. 2 shows that the injected H2A.Z/EGFP fusion protein was first detected at approximately stage 7 of development before the initiation of embryonic transcription at the MBT. Significantly, before the MBT the H2A.Z/EGFP fusion protein is found in a diffuse pattern, not associated with chromatin, within cells of the early cleavage stages (Fig. 2B). During these early divisions of rapid genome replication, the interphase nucleus is not reconstructed, and DNA remains highly methylated suggesting that chromatin has a unique structure until the MBT (32Lemaitre J.M. Geraud G. Mechali M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Following MBT, in contrast to early cleavage stages, we detected green fluorescence clearly localized specifically in the cell nucleus (Fig. 2, C–F) in a pattern consistent with the localization of DNA (see Fig. 2, E and F). We conclude that injected H2A.Z mRNA is translated into protein early in development but is not targeted to chromatin until gastrulation, after zygotic transcription and asynchronous cell divisions commence. Consistent with this result, H2A.F/Z zebrafish embryos displayed similar developmental localization patterns (33Pauls S. Geldmacher-Voss B. Campos-Ortega J.A. Dev. Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These results therefore support our hypothesis that H2A.Z is required at gastrulation perhaps to initiate or maintain a particular developmental process. In agreement with this conclusion, endogenous H2A.Z expression peaks at gastrulation (23Iouzalen N. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3947-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). H2A.Z Overexpression Slows Developmental Progression after Gastrulation—Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type H2A.Z in Xenopus embryos, by RNA injection into the two-cell stage embryo, delayed development compared with uninjected or H2A-injected control embryos (Fig. 3). Following in vitro fertilization, development proceeded normally in the H2A.Z-injected embryos until the gastrula stage (Fig. 3F) after which a delay of approximately two developmental stages was observed (Fig. 3, I and L). Despite the delay, embryos were morphologically indistinguishable from control embryos to the swimming tadpole stage (data not shown) suggesting that they are competent to develop normally. Next we investigated whether changing the extended acidic patch of H2A.Z back to H2A would generate a dominant-negative phenotype (H2A.ZNK; Fig. 4, B and D, panels E and F). Although no dominant-negative phenotype was observed, this mutant did not show the pronounced developmental delay observed with the overexpression of wild-type H2A.Z (Fig. 4D, panels C and D). This raises the possibility that H2A.ZNK mimics the core H2A histone (Fig. 3) and that the acidic patch functionally distinguishes H2A.Z from H2A. In vitro structural analyses led us to suggest that the extended acidic patch of H2A.Z is responsible for the ability of H2A.Z to produce a more compact secondary chromatin structure (34Fan J.Y.

Injection of RNA expressing some H2A.Z mutant proteins produced a striking defect beginning at gastrulation and resulting in aberrant development and failure of the blastopore to close (Fig. 4, C and D). It is worth noting that the RNA interference and dominant-negative approaches yielded a defect in only a fraction of injected embryos (as observed in other studies using a similar strategy (28Sive H.L. Grainger R.M. Harland R.M. Early Development of Xenopus laevis: A Laboratory Mannual. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press, New York2000: 39-79Google Scholar, 30Nakano H. Amemiya S. Shiokawa K. Taira M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Glavic A. Maris Honore S. Gloria Feijoo C. Bastidas F. Allende M.L. Mayor R. Dev. Biol. 2004; 272: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)), since injected RNA levels were intentionally kept to a minimum to eliminate nonspecific effects. Significantly, this defect was uniform for all mutant embryos and was similar to the phenotype observed using RNA interference. Embryos ultimately displayed a shortened trunk and opening of varying size in their dorsal surface (Fig. 4D, panels H and J). The “H2A.Z dominant-negative” phenotype was only observed with a subset of mutations suggesting that they have lost functionally important regions of H2A.Z. The most significant mutations were in the two histidine residues that lie in the proposed region for protein/protein interactions (24Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). When one (H2A.ZNH) or both (H2A.ZNQ) of these residues are altered, it gives rise to the dominant-negative phenotype in over 50% of embryos (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, these histidine residues in H2A.Z are not found in yeast (Fig. 4E). Since these sites are functionally relevant in X. laevis, they may define a distinct activity for development of higher eukaryotes. The second mutation, in which a region encompassing the α-helix of H2A.Z was replaced with the equivalent region of H2A (H2A.ZCS), produced a dominant-negative phenotype in ∼40% of embryos. In Drosophila this mutant protein could not rescue the H2A.Z null phenotype, and flies died early in development (14Clarkson M.J. Wells J.R. Gibson F. Saint R. Tremethick D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We conclude that two regions that include the C-terminal α-helix and the two histidine residues, located on the surface of an H2A.Z nucleosome, are vital for H2A.Z function, and overexpression of these mutant proteins interferes with X. laevis development in a tissue-specific and developmentally specific manner. H2A.Z Is Enriched in Tissues of Chordamesodermal Origin—The ability of some H2A.Z mutants to generate a uniform dominant-negative phenotype affecting mesoderm formation raises the possibility that it plays a specific role in the development of these tissues. If this is the case H2A.Z expression may be regulated differently in mesoderm specific cells. Previous reports of developmental H2A.Z expression patterns in X. laevis embryos showed that H2A.Z RNA is present in oocytes, but on fertilization H2A.Z is poorly expressed until gastrulation when it has a ubiquitous high expression profile (23Iouzalen N. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3947-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, when we investigated the localization of endogenous H2A.Z RNA in more detail, we found that it is clearly enriched in specialized tissues (Fig. 5 compare A–E to F, G, I, and J). X. laevis H2A.Z RNA is preferentially expressed in the notochord and defined regions of the primitive ear. This pattern corresponds to tissues of mesoderm origin that arise from convergent extension during gastrulation. Results presented here show enrichment of an H2A histone variant within a specific tissue and its necessity for normal development. Perturbation of H2A.Z by an RNA interference and an overexpression and dominant-negative approach demonstrate that this variant is required at gastrulation for correct mesoderm formation. Notably, a region on the surface of the H2A.Z containing nucleosome is critical, providing a vital link between a specific structural chromatin remodelling event and a developmental pathway. The nature of the unique H2A.Z containing nucleosomal surface suggests that H2A.Z acts by recruiting nuclear proteins or by altering nucleosome/nucleosome interactions. In support of this hypothesis, mutation of a single histidine residue within the surface domain gives rise to a uniform developmental defect in mesoderm formation. The essential histidine residues are not present in yeast H2A.Z suggesting that H2A.Z may have evolved additional roles necessary for development in higher eukaryotes. One role requires the NK residues on the acidic patch that we have recently shown can modify the structure of nucleosomal arrays.3 We believe that this acidic patch region is important for heterochromatin formation and thus necessary for proper chromosome segregation. Here we identify a unique surface domain that is required for a second role being vital for early development. Gastrulation is a critical stage in mesoderm development when two pathways of mesoderm progression are defined. The regions that involute first form the prechordal mesoderm pathway and the later involuting regions form the chordamesoderm, which gives rise to the notocord. The prechordal mesoderm cells develop by active cell migration leading to the formation of the head region, whereas chordamesoderm progresses by convergent extension resulting in the movement of cells to define the anterioposterior axis and the notocord (36Gerhart J. Keller R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 201-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 37Winklbauer R. Dev. Biol. 1990; 142: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 38Keller R. Winklbauer R. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1992; 27: 39-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recent evidence implicates the transcription factor Xenopus brachyury as an essential factor for convergent extension that actively inhibits cell migration and thereby distinguishes these two processes during gastrulation (39Kwan K.M. Kirschner M.W. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that H2A.Z is enriched in chordamesoderm (Fig. 5). One attractive possibility is that H2A.Z plays a regulatory role in the expression of factors, such as Xenopus brachyury, that are vital for correct convergent extension. Alternatively, since overexpression of H2A.Z slows development (Fig. 3), regulating the level of H2A.Z expression in a particular cell type may control the rate of cellular proliferation that is intimately linked to cellular differentiation perhaps by increasing heterochromatin formation. Overexpression of the H2A.Z dominant-negative proteins may thereby interfere with normal development primarily in the cell lineage that expresses endogenous H2A.Z at a high level. Importantly, our experimental evidence clearly demonstrates that general chromatin components can be specifically involved in pattern-formation processes during early X. laevis development. Our work in mouse embryos and mammalian tissue culture cells demonstrates that H2A.Z has an essential role in chromosome segregation (10Rangasamy D. Berven L. Ridgway P. Tremethick D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1599-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 11Rangasamy D. Greaves I. Tremethick D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 650-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast to early mouse development, where H2A.Z is transcribed from the 2-cell stage, 4D. Tremethick, unpublished data.Xenopus H2A.Z expression peaks at gastrulation indicating that H2A.Z may have a specialized role in Xenopus. When we deplete or overexpress dominant-negative H2A.Z protein in Xenopus embryos, developmental perturbations are not evident until after gastrulation once asynchronous cell divisions are established. Possibly H2A.Z is not required for early cleavage divisions and only becomes necessary at the onset of asynchronous divisions when the cell cycle lengthens. The diffuse localization of the H2A.Z/EGFP fusion protein during the early cleavage divisions is consistent with this notion. Also consistent are reports that H2A.Z protein levels are elevated in terminally differentiated cells when the cell cycle slows (40Wunsch A.M. Reinhardt K. Lough J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1991; 59: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and reduced during rapid proliferation in cells of the mouse embryo inner cell mass (10Rangasamy D. Berven L. Ridgway P. Tremethick D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1599-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It is important to point out that cells of the axial mesoderm (notocord) also display characteristics of terminally differentiated cells (41Saka Y. Smith J.C. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).

Varying Histones to Regulate DevelopmentJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 279Issue 42PreviewCells use histone variants to change the biochemical makeup of their nucleosomes and control chromatin function. Replacing the H2A core histone with the H2A.Z variant alters the nucleosomal docking domain, a region involved in stabilizing interactions with other histones. Interestingly, this new docking domain contains two surface histidines and a metal ion that are indicative of a protein/protein interaction surface. While H2A.Z has been implicated in development in Drosophila and mice, the variant histone's specific functions during early development are largely unknown. Full-Text PDF Open Access"

Here we analyzed the roles of protein kinase B/Akt isoforms in such differentiation state distinctions. Anoikis was induced in undifferentiated and differentiated enterocytes by inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (Fak; pharmacologic inhibition or overexpression of dominant-negative mutants) or β1 integrins (antibody blocking) or by maintaining cells in suspension. Expression/activation parameters of Akt isoforms (Akt-1, Akt-2, and Akt-3) and Fak were analyzed. Activity of Akt isoforms was also blocked by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or by overexpression of dominant-negative mutants. Here we report the following. 1) The expression/activation levels of Akt-1 increase overall during enterocytic differentiation, and those of Akt-2 decrease, whereas Akt-3 is not expressed. 2) Akt-1 activation is dependent on β1 integrins/Fak signaling, regardless of the differentiation state. 3) Akt-2 activation is dependent on β1 integrins/Fak signaling in undifferentiated cells only. 4) Activation of Akt-1 is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent, whereas that of Akt-2 is not. 5) Akt-2 does not promote survival or apoptosis/anoikis. 6) Akt-1 is essential for survival. 7) Akt-2 cannot substitute for Akt-1 in the suppression of anoikis. Hence, the expression and regulation of Akt isoforms show differentiation state-specific distinctions that ultimately reflect upon their selective implication in the mediation of human intestinal epithelial cell survival.

The phosphorylation of the serine 473 residue in the tail domain of Akt-1 is required to allow for its maximal activation.

The human intestinal epithelium is a useful biological model for the study of the cell dynamics involved in tissue homeostasis. Its continuous renewal essentially consists of the production of enterocytes in the crypts, which differentiate and then migrate toward the apex of the villi in order to enter anoikis (24Potten C.S.

In addition, proliferative crypt cells may enter “spontaneous” apoptosis, a less frequent process that serves to remove defective or injured undifferentiated progeny cells (24Potten C.S. Am. J.

This in turn fits well with the fact that intestinal epithelial cells express differential integrin profiles and interact with specific basement membrane components along the crypt-villus axis, depending on their state of differentiation (35Beaulieu J.-F. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D310-D321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that the regulation of human enterocytic cell survival involves distinct mechanisms according to the state of differentiation, the question as to the specific implication of individual Akt isoforms in this process therefore remains open. In the present study, we investigated the expression, regulation, and roles of Akt-1, Akt-2, and Akt-3 in the suppression of human intestinal epithelial cell anoikis within the context of undifferentiated versus differentiated cells. By using several approaches, we provide evidence that the expression and regulation of Akt isoforms by cell adhesion and cell adhesion signaling show differentiation state-specific distinctions in human intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, we identify the β1 integrin/Fak/PI3K/Akt-1 signaling pathway as a crucial determinant in the suppression of enterocytic anoikis, whereas Akt-2 is independent of PI3K and does not play a role in enterocytic cell survival or death.

Quaroni, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY); Abs 9661 and 9492, directed against CASP-3 and CASP-7, respectively (New England Biolabs, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada); and mAbCY-90 (Sigma), directed to human K18. Anti-mouse, -rabbit and -sheep secondary antibodies for IF and/or WB were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Cell Signaling Technology, Sigma, and Roche Applied Science. All other materials were purchased from Sigma, Fisher, and/or Roche Applied Science, except when otherwise specified. It is of note that the strict specificity of the antibodies used herein for immunoprecipitation and/or Western blot for p57Akt-1 and p57Akt-2, as well as for pser473p57Akt-1, was verified. As shown in Fig. 2A, immunoprecipitated p57Akt-1 was not recognized by the anti-Akt-2 antibody, whereas immunoprecipitated p57Akt-2 was not recognized by the anti-Akt-1 antibody. Furthermore, the anti-pser473p57Akt-1 antibody reacted with immunoprecipitated Akt-1 but not with Akt-2 (Fig. 2A). Conversely, the anti-phosphoserine antibody reacted with both p57Akt-1 and p57Akt-2 (Fig. 2A), as expected. Antibodies strictly specific for the phosphorylated serine 474 residue of Akt-2 were not available at the time of the present study.

Two oligodeoxynucleotides of identical sequence, but containing either 2-aminoimidazolone or 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole at a specific site, were ligated into single-stranded M13mp7L2 bacteriophage genomes. Wild-type AB1157 Escherichia coli cells were transformed with the site-specific 2-aminoimidazolone- and 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole-containing genomes, and analysis of the resulting progeny phage allowed determination of the in vivo bypass efficiencies and mutational signatures of the DNA lesions. 2-Aminoimidazolone was efficiently bypassed and 91% mutagenic, producing almost exclusively G to C transversion mutations. In contrast, 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole was a strong block to replication and 50% mutagenic, generating G to A, G to T, and to a lesser extent, G to C mutations. The G to A mutation elicited by 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole implicates this lesion as a novel source of peroxynitrite-induced transition mutations in vivo. For comparison, the error-prone bypass DNA polymerases were overexpressed in the cells by irradiation with UV light (SOS induction) prior to transformation. SOS induction caused little change in the efficiency of DNA polymerase bypass of 2-aminoimidazolone; however, bypass of 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole increased nearly 10-fold. Importantly, the mutation frequencies of both lesions decreased during replication in SOS-induced cells. These data suggest that 2-aminoimidazolone and 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole in DNA are substrates for one or more of the SOS-induced Y-family DNA polymerases and demonstrate that 2-aminoimidazolone and 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole are potent sources of mutations in vivo.

The reactive species responsible for DNA damage are generated by common endogenous processes (9De Bont R. Van Larebeke N. Mutagenesis. 2004; 19: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) such as respiration and inflammation (10Turrens J.F. Biosci.

Under physiological conditions, ONOO– rapidly combines with CO2 to form nitrosoperoxycarbonate (ONOOCO2−), which subsequently undergoes homolysis to produce carbonate radical (CO3˙¯) and nitrogen dioxide (·NO2) (20Lymar S.V.

These radicals are believed to be responsible for the oxidation and nitration of DNA caused by exposure to ONOO– (23Shafirovich V. Dourandin A. Huang W. Geacintov N.E. J. Biol.

Because guanine possesses the lowest redox potential of the four DNA nucleobases (E7 = 1.27 V versus normal hydrogen electrode) (26Steenken S. Jovanovic S.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 617-618Crossref Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), it is preferentially oxidized by ONOO– compared with the other natural nucleobases (27Burney S. Niles J.C. Dedon P.C. Tannenbaum S.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Several products are formed directly from guanine residues in DNA including 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), 8-nitroguanine (8-NO2-G), 2-aminoimidazolone (Iz), and 5-guanidino-4-nitroimidazole (NI) (Fig. 1) (28Niles J.C. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 12147-12151Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The lesions 8-oxoG and 8-NO2-G are highly susceptible to further oxidation (27Burney S. Niles J.C. Dedon P.C. Tannenbaum S.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and yield a variety of additional products (29Lee J.M. Niles J.C. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Chem. Res.

Toxicol. 1999; 12: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although many of these guanine-derived oxidation products have been characterized for their in vivo mutagenic potential (31Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C. Gu F. Tannenbaum S.R. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 32Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C. Muller J.G. Neeley W.L. Tannenbaum S.R. Burrows C.J. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9257-9262Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), Iz and NI have received little attention. To assess the biological significance and consequences of oxidatively damaged DNA, it is essential that these lesions be characterized for their genotoxic and mutagenic potential. In the work presented here, we report the in vivo genotoxic and mutagenic properties of Iz and NI. Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), site-specifically modified with Iz or NI, were synthesized using a method described previously (33Ikeda H. Saito I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10836-10837Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and a procedure developed in our laboratory (34Neeley W.L. Henderson P.T. Essigmann J.M. Org. Lett. 2004; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The biological impact of unique Iz and NI lesions was addressed under normal and SOS-induced conditions in wild-type AB1157 Escherichia coli cells using viral vectors containing the modified ODNs. Both lesions were bypassed by the E. coli replication machinery and were substrates for SOS-induced error-prone DNA polymerase bypass. Furthermore, each lesion was potently mutagenic during DNA replication. Oligodeoxynucleotides—DNA synthesis reagents were purchased from Glen Research. Unmodified ODNs were purchased from IDT, Inc. and were purified by PAGE. The 19-mer ODN sequence used was 5′-GCG AAG ACC GXA GCG TCC G-3′, where X is G, Iz, NI, or a tetrahydrofuran (THF) abasic site. The 19-mer containing the THF abasic site analog was prepared as described (31Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C. Gu F. Tannenbaum S.R. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The 19-mer containing Iz was prepared as described previously (33Ikeda H. Saito I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10836-10837Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8-methoxy-2′-deoxyguanosine was incorporated into the 19-mer ODN by the phosphoramidite method, and the ODN was deprotected and cleaved from the solid support with concentrated NH4OH at 55 °C for 15 h. The 8-methoxy-2′-deoxyguanosine-containing ODN was purified by PAGE, and the 8-methoxy-2′-deoxyguanosine was subsequently converted to Iz by photoirradiation with 365 nm light in the presence of riboflavin. The Iz-containing 19-mer was purified by anion exchange HPLC on a Dionex NucleoPac PA-100 (4 × 250 mm) analytical column using 10% CH3CN in water (solvent A) and aqueous 1.5 m NH4OAc (solvent B) as solvents. A flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used, and solvent B was increased from 10 to 25% over 2.5 min and then increased from 25 to 100% over 30 min. The purified 19-mer was characterized using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (calculated Mr, 5824.8; found Mr, 5825.8) and enzymatic digestion to nucleosides followed by HPLC analysis. For the enzymatic digestion, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 18 units of nuclease P1, 12 units of alkaline phosphatase (both enzymes from Roche Applied Science), and 2 nmol of Iz-containing 19-mer in 50 μl were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then immediately analyzed by HPLC. For the HPLC analysis, a Supelco Supercosil LC-18-DB (250 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm) column was used with aqueous 150 mm NH4OAc as solvent A and CH3CN as solvent B. A flow rate of 0.25 ml/min was used, and solvent B was increased from 0 to 15% over 40 min. Five peaks were observed with UV-visible spectra consistent with the nucleosides Iz, C, G, T, and A. The ODN containing NI was prepared by incorporating 5-bromo-4-nitroimidazole into the 19-mer sequence by the phosphoramidite method and subsequently treating the 19-mer with 0.5 m guanidine in THF and then with concentrated NH4OH to produce the 19-mer containing NI (34Neeley W.L. Henderson P.T. Essigmann J.M. Org. Lett. 2004; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The NI-containing 19-mer was purified by C18 reversed phase HPLC (34Neeley W.L. Henderson P.T. Essigmann J.M. Org. Lett. 2004; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and by anion exchange HPLC as described above and characterized using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (calculated Mr, 5882.9; found Mr, 5882.7) and enzymatic digestion with snake venom phosphodiesterase (ICN Biomedical) and alkaline phosphatase (34Neeley W.L. Henderson P.T. Essigmann J.M. Org. Lett. 2004; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) followed by HPLC analysis (same method as described for the 19-mer containing Iz). For the HPLC analysis, five peaks were observed with UV-visible spectra consistent with the nucleosides NI, C, G, T, and A. Genome Construction—Genomes were constructed in triplicate (Fig. 2) on a 10-pmol scale as described previously (31Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C. Gu F. Tannenbaum S.R. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 32Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C. Muller J.G. Neeley W.L. Tannenbaum S.R. Burrows C.J. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9257-9262Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 35Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, the single-stranded M13 DNA was linearized by cleavage with EcoRI (30 units/pmol DNA, 23 °C for 8 h) at a hairpin containing a single EcoRI site (35Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The genome was recircularized by annealing in the presence of the 5′-phosphorylated 19-mer insert and two “scaffold” ODNs (sequences that are partially complementary to the 5′ and 3′ sides of the insert and the genomic DNA termini) and incubating with 22.5 units/μl T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 16 °C in a volume of 55 μl (31Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C. Gu F. Tannenbaum S.R. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Two short scaffolds are used to leave a single-stranded gap at the site of the lesion, thereby facilitating efficient ligation regardless of the lesion structure. The scaffold DNA was removed using the exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences) by treating with 0.25 units/μl for 1 h at 16 °C in a volume of 65 μl (36Moriya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 37Moriya M. Zhang W. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, scaffold digestion was complete as determined by using a radiolabeled scaffold and analyzing the reaction with PAGE and phosphorimaging. The genome constructs were diluted to 115 μl with H2O, extracted with 100 μl of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) (Invitrogen) and desalted with Sephadex G50 fine resin (Amersham Biosciences). The stability of the lesion-containing 19-mers was assessed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The 19-mers were exposed to the conditions used for genome construction with the exception that M13 DNA, other ODNs, and enzymes were excluded. The mass spectra of the 19-mers were essentially unchanged after exposure to the mock genome construction conditions. The amount of circular, 19-mer insert-containing genome in each sample was quantified by agarose gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging. This was accomplished by annealing 1 pmol of a 5′ 32P-labeled 30-mer probe ODN (5′-TCC CAG TCA CGA CGT TGT AAA ACG ACG GCC-3′) to 0.1 pmol of each genome construct in a region of the genome that did not include the lesion-containing 19-mer insert. The annealing solution consisted of 100 mm NaCl, 4.2% Ficoll, 0.042% bromphenol blue, and 0.042% xylene cyanol FF in a volume of 15.5 μl. The genomeprobe mixtures (15.5 μl) were run on a 0.9% agarose gel in 1× Tris borate/EDTA buffer for 4 h at 100 V, after which the free probe front was excised. The gel was run for an additional 3 h and then transferred onto a glass plate and dried under a box fan for 36 h. The amount of circular genome was quantified by phosphorimaging and the genome construct solution volumes adjusted such that each solution used for cell transformation contained an equal concentration of circular DNA. Preparation of Electrocompetent Cells—Two 150-ml aliquots of LB medium were each inoculated with 1.5 ml from separate overnight cultures of wild-type AB1157 E. coli and grown on a shaker at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.4. Each culture was centrifuged, resuspended in 25 ml of 10 mm MgSO4, and transferred to a large (150 × 15 mm) Petri dish. The SOS system was induced in the cells by irradiating with 254 nm light (45 J/m2 of energy), immediately transferring the cells to two 125-ml aliquots of 2× YT medium, and growing them for 40 min at 37 °C with shaking. Uninduced cells were treated identically, except without exposure to UV light. The 2× YT cultures were centrifuged, combined, and washed twice with 175 ml of deionized water. The electrocompetent cells were resuspended in 4 ml of a 10% solution of glycerol in water, stored at 4 °C, and used the following day. Translesion Bypass Efficiency—An equal amount of each circular genome construct was mixed with 0.025 pmol of internal standard (wild-type circular single-stranded M13mp7L2 DNA) and 100 μl of electrocompetent cells. The cell/genome mixtures were electroporated and transferred to 10 ml of LB, generating at least 105 independent transformed cells as determined by plating of an aliquot onto agar plates. The cultures were incubated at room temperature for at least 30 min and then incubated on a roller drum for 4 h at 37 °C to amplify the progeny phage. The cells were spun down and the progeny phage-containing supernatant retained. In this system, successful replication of the genomes by the E. coli host leads to the production of progeny phage. When plated on a lawn of NR9050 indicator E. coli in the presence of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and X-gal (Gold Biotechnology), progeny phage derived from genomes containing the 19-mer insert produce blue plaques if no mutation, a point mutation, or an in-frame insertion or deletion mutation occurs at the lesion site, whereas progeny phage from WT M13mp7L2 genomes, genomes lacking an insert (genetic engineering mutants), and lesion-induced out-of-frame insertions and deletions produce clear plaques (31Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C. Gu F. Tannenbaum S.R. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, the amplified progeny phage were diluted and plated such that ∼1000–2000 total plaques were produced per Petri dish, and the number of blue and clear plaques per plate was counted. The number of normalized blue plaques resulting from each lesion-containing genome relative to that of the normalized guanine control indicated the bypass efficiency of a lesion (see “Results” for details). The normalization allowed direct comparison of lesion bypass by DNA polymerase(s) between genomes containing different inserts, regardless of unavoidable variation in factors such as electroporation efficiency and the total number of plaques on each plate. Mutation Type and Frequency—Electrocompetent cells were transformed with each genome construct, as described in the previous section, except that the internal standard was excluded. As before, the electroporations produced at least 105 independent transformed cells. Amplified progeny phage (100 μl) and 10 μl of an overnight growth of SCS110 E. coli were added to 10 ml of LB medium and grown for 6 h at 37 °C on a roller drum. The cultures were centrifuged, and the phage-containing supernatant was retained. Single-stranded phage DNA was isolated from 700 μl of each sample using a QIAPrep Spin M13 kit (Qiagen). The region containing the lesion site was amplified by PCR as described previously (31Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C. Gu F. Tannenbaum S.R. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), except 0.7 μm of each primer was used, and the resultant 101-mer PCR product was purified using a QIAPrep PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The restriction endonuclease and post-labeling analysis of mutation frequency (REAP) assay was used to determine the identity of the base at the site formerly occupied by the lesion (31Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C. Gu F. Tannenbaum S.R. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 32Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C. Muller J.G. Neeley W.L. Tannenbaum S.R.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6723-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Genome Construction—Convertible nucleoside phosphoramidites were used to introduce each oxidized DNA lesion into a 19-mer ODN at a defined site. Following incorporation into the 19-mer by automated DNA synthesis, 8-methoxyguanine was converted to Iz by photoirradiation in the presence of riboflavin (33Ikeda H. Saito I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10836-10837Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Using a procedure recently developed in our laboratory, NI was formed within an ODN from the convertible nucleoside 5-bromo-4-nitroimidazole by treatment of the ODN with guanidine (34Neeley W.L. Henderson P.T. Essigmann J.M. Org. Lett. 2004; 6: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Each ODN was characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and by nuclease and phosphatase digestion followed by HPLC analysis. Single-stranded M13mp7L2 viral genomes containing Iz or NI at a specific site in the genome were constructed as shown in Fig. 2. An aliquot of each genome construct, annealed to a radiolabeled ODN probe, was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging to assess the yield of circular insert-containing genome. Following quantification, the genome construct solutions were normalized such that each contained an equivalent amount of circular insert-containing genome. The stability of each lesion to the genome construction conditions was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry after subjecting the lesion-containing ODNs to the same conditions. Translesion Bypass Efficiency—A viral plaque assay based on lacZ α-complementation was employed for the determination of the lesion bypass efficiency (Fig. 3). In this system, phage produced from genomes containing the 19-mer insert cause the formation of blue plaques when plated on isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside/X-gal indicator plates if either no mutation or a point mutation occurs at the lesion site, and phage produced from WT M13mp7L2 genomes produce clear plaques. The number of phage that form blue plaques varies with the efficiency of lesion bypass, and the rate of replication of the WT M13mp7L2 genomes is assumed to be independent of the identity of the insert-containing genomes. Thus, a genome containing a lesion that partially blocks replication yields a lower proportion of progeny phage relative to a genome containing a freely bypassed lesion. Because the same amount of internal standard (WT M13mp7L2 genome) was used in each mixture, the blue to clear ratio of each mixture can be directly compared after being normalized to reflect the identical amount of internal standard in each mixture. The bypass efficiency of a lesion is scaled relative to guanine, which is defined as having a bypass efficiency of 100%. From this logic the equation given in Fig. 3 results, where the term B(L)/B(G) is the definition of relative bypass efficiency and the term C(G)/C(L) is the normalization factor. A limitation of this assay is that lesion-induced out-of-frame insertion and deletion mutations would also produce clear plaques and therefore not be counted as bypass events. However, as discussed in the next section the lesions studied here induced negligible amounts of observable insertion and deletion mutations and so a correction for these events was not performed. In normal WT AB1157 E. coli, the bypass efficiency of Iz was 60 ± 5% (Fig. 4). By contrast, NI was a much stronger replication block and was bypassed with an efficiency of only 7.0 ± 1.6%. As a control, we also determined the bypass efficiency of a synthetic THF abasic site. The THF lesion was bypassed with an efficiency of 5.8 ± 0.7% in agreement with previous work showing that this lesion is a block to DNA replication (31Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C. Gu F. Tannenbaum S.R. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 32Henderson P.T. Delaney J.C. Muller J.G. Neeley W.L. Tannenbaum S.R. Burrows C.J.

Cell. 1998; 2: 191-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The bypass efficiencies of the lesions were also determined in cells with the SOS system induced. Under these conditions, the bypass efficiency of Iz did not change significantly (71 ± 7%); however, the bypass efficiency of NI increased a remarkable 8-fold to 57 ± 1%. The bypass efficiency of the THF lesion increased to 30 ± 2%, demonstrating that the SOS system was indeed induced. Mutation Type and Frequency—The mutational signature of each lesion in WT AB1157 E. coli was determined using the REAP assay (Fig. 5). Insertion and deletion mutations that do not compromise the BbsI recognition site or the PCR primer sites are detectable by the REAP assay during the PAGE purification step and were negligible in this work (less than 1%, data not shown). In normal cells, the mutation frequency of Iz was 91% versus 50% for NI (Fig. 6). The mutations induced by Iz were essentially all G→ C mutations, as predicted by molecular orbital calculations and in vitro primer extension experiments (40Kino K. Sugiyama H. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 41Kino K. Saito I. Sugiyama H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7373-7374Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). NI caused 8.9 ± 0.5% G→ C mutations and a roughly equivalent amount of G→ A and G→ T mutations (19 ± 2% and 22 ± 3%, respectively). The mutation type and frequency for each lesion was also determined in SOS-induced cells to investigate the effect of the SOS response system on the coding properties of these lesions. Interestingly, Iz and NI had somewhat lower overall mutation frequencies of 84 and 33%, respectively. The coding properties of Iz were more degenerate under SOS-induced conditions. Whereas Iz caused 2.0 ± 0.1% G→ A and 1.1 ± 0.2% G→ T mutations without SOS induced, the lesion now induced 3.4 ± 0.5% G→ A and 5.5 ± 0.8% G→ T mutations. The mutational signature of NI also differed in SOS-induced cells, as the lesion induced many fewer G→ A and G→ C mutations (13 ± 2% and 2.5 ± 0.6%, respectively). To assess the biological fate of Iz and NI in DNA, we have determined the relative bypass efficiency and the mutation type and frequency of each lesion in vivo. The Iz derivative is a major and ubiquitous in vitro product of guanine oxidation. In addition to forming as a result of ONOO– oxidation (28Niles J.C. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 12147-12151Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), this lesion also form"

Recently, the murine dsRNA-binding protein RAX and its human ortholog PACT were identified as cellular activators of PKR. Previous reports demonstrate that following stress, RAX/PACT associates with and activates PKR resulting in eIF2α phosphorylation, consequent translation inhibition, and cell death via apoptosis. Although RAX/PACT is phosphorylated during stress, any regulatory role for this post-translational modification has been uncertain. Now we have discovered that RAX is phosphorylated on serine 18 in both human and mouse cells. The non-phosphorylatable form of RAX, RAX(S18A), although still able to bind dsRNA and associate with PKR, fails to activate PKR following stress. Furthermore, stable expression of RAX(S18A) results in a dominant-negative effect characterized by deficiency of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α subunit phosphorylation, delay of translation inhibition, and failure to undergo rapid apoptosis following removal of interleukin-3. We propose that the ability of RAX to activate PKR is regulated by a sequential mechanism featuring RAX association with PKR, RAX phosphorylation at serine 18, and activation of PKR.

RAX and PACT are 98% identical in amino acid sequence and contain three conserved dsRNA binding motifs. The N-terminal first and second motifs bind to dsRNA and are necessary for association with PKR, whereas the C-terminal third motif is apparently not important for either dsRNA or PKR interaction but is instead responsible for activating the kinase activity of PKR. It has been demonstrated that RAX/PACT can efficiently activate PKR in vitro (1Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol.

However, in vivo, RAX/PACT-mediated PKR activation is dependent on stress application to cells (1Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol.

Although both RAX/PACT and PKR are dsRNA-binding proteins, PKR activation may not rely on dsRNA binding because in vitro activation by RAX/PACT does not require dsRNA (1Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J.

The serine-threonine kinase activity of PKR is activated by viral dsRNA, resulting in the phosphorylation of a physiological substrate of PKR, eIF2α, and consequent translation inhibition. However, it has become clear recently that PKR is also an essential mediator of signaling by both cytokines and growth factors and may even function as a tumor suppressor (8Meurs E. Galabru J.

Under such circumstances, where there may be no apparent source of dsRNA necessary to activate PKR, it is believed that RAX/PACT may be responsible for PKR activation (1Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J.

Multipotential hematopoietic growth factors such as IL-3 are responsible for regulating growth of bone marrow progenitor cells (16Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The binding of IL-3 to its receptor initiates a signal transduction cascade that results in cell proliferation, differentiation, and suppression of apoptosis. The removal of IL-3 from factor-dependent cells induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (20Kelvin D.J. Chance S. Shreeve M. Axelrad A.A. Connolly J.A. McLeod D. J. Cell.

Previous work in our laboratory has established a link between IL-3 withdrawal and RAX-mediated PKR activation in vivo (16Ito T. Jagus R. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7455-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the presence of IL-3, PKR remains inactivated, and cells grow normally. However, the stress of IL-3 deprivation results in RAX phosphorylation, promotion of RAX-PKR association, PKR activation, consequent inhibition of translation, and ultimately programmed cell death (1Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15427-15432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 4Ruvolo P.P. Gao F. Blalock W.L. Deng X. May W.S. J. Biol.

The correlation between the stress-mediated stimulation of RAX phosphorylation and PKR activation in a mechanism that leads to cell death suggests that stress applications such as IL-3 withdrawal may regulate RAX by phosphorylation to trigger this cellular shutdown cascade.The mechanism(s) by which the withdrawal of IL-3 can mediate RAX function and subsequent PKR activation is undefined. Nevertheless, it is clear that an additional signal(s) is required for RAX to mediate PKR activation, because overexpression of RAX alone is not sufficient to activate PKR (1Ito T. Yang M. May W.S.

The functional significance of our recent discovery that RAX is a phospho-protein, and the mechanism by which RAX/PACT-mediated PKR activation is regulated, is not yet understood. To investigate a role for RAX/PACT phosphorylation in activating PKR, we created a series of serine to alanine substitution mutants that were used to identify the site of RAX phosphorylation. Stable expression of these mutants has enabled us to identify the regulatory significance of RAX phosphorylation on PKR activation and subsequent cell death.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and Cell Lines—NSF/N1.H7 and BaF3 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% calf serum, and 20% WEHI-3B conditioned media as a source of IL-3. REH cells were maintained in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS7 cells and PKR null mouse embryonic fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.FLAG-tagged and HA-tagged RAX constructs were cloned into vector pcDEF3, which utilizes the elongation factor-1α promoter (23Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This vector is more effective for RAX expression than any CMV promoter vector tried to date. Suspension cells were transfected by electroporation while LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) was used to transfect adherent cells according to manufacturer's protocol. Stable clones were selected in G418 (0.6 mg/ml) and screened by Western blotting with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or anti-HA antibody (Covance), horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Santa Cruz), and ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).Phosphorylation Site Identification—Phosphorylation site prediction was performed using the algorithms found at PROSITE (au.expasy.org/prosite/) (24Gasteiger E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Site-specific RAX mutants were created using the Altered Sites mutagenesis system (Promega). HA- and FLAG-tagged RAX were cloned into pAL-TERMAX. Oligonucleotides (Sigma Genosys) were designed that created RAX mutants where individual serine (S) residues were substituted with alanine (A). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used were as follows: S18A, 5′-CAAACTGAAGGTGCCGGCGTCCTCGCGCTG-3′; S22A, 5′-CATCTTGCCCAAGGCGAAGGTCCCGCT-3′; S83A, 5′-CGCCAGCTTCTTAGCGGTACCTTCACC-3′; S130A, 5′-TAATTCCTGTAAGGCGCCAATTGGATT-3′; S148A, 5′-TCCTCCTTCCTGGGCTAGCGTATATTCAGGAAG-3′; S167A, 5′-AGTTTCCATGAAAGCTTCAAGCCTGCA-3′; S176A, 5′-GGCTTGTTTTTTTGCGGCGCCCTTTCCAGTTTC3′; S196A, 5′-GTGGTTCTCTGGAGCTATATTACTAAACTT-3′; S217A, 5′-AGGGGAATTCCTTAAGGCGTGCCAAGTGCA-3′; S221A, 5′-CTTCTCACCAGGGGCATTCCTCAAGGA-3′; S235A, 5′-GTCTGTGTTCGGGAGCGCTAGGAGGCTCCTTTT-3′; S246A, 5′-GCTGGCAATCTCAGCTAGCAGCTGGATGTA-3′; S250A, 5′-AAAGCCTTGCTCCGCGGCAATCTCACT-3′; S279A, 5′-CACGGTGATAGGCGCCGTGGACAGCTCTGC-3′; S290A, 5′-ACTCTGTGCATTGCCGGCGGAGATGCCTGAGCC-3′. DNA sequencing was performed by the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida core facility to confirm the constructs contained only the desired change.The resulting expression vectors were transfected into COS7 cells. After 48 h, cells were washed twice in phosphate-free RPMI and incubated in phosphate-free RPMI containing 100μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in GLB (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 15% glycerol) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I (Sigma P2850). RAX and RAX mutants were immunoprecipitated using either HA-agarose conjugate (Santa Cruz) or FLAG M2-agarose conjugate (Sigma). The immunoprecipitate was washed three times with GLB, two times with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Protein was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. 32P-Labeled protein was detected by autoradiography, and Western blotting was used to confirm RAX protein identity. The Western blots were quantitated by densitometry analysis using the program Fluorchem (Alpha Innotech Corp.).Cell Viability Assays and Protein Half-life Determination—NFS/N1.H7 cells and BaF3 cells were washed three times in medium without IL-3 and resuspended at 3 × 105 cells/ml. At appropriate times, cell viability was measured by trypan blue dye exclusion, and apoptosis was measured by annexin V staining according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry was performed at the University of Florida flow cytometry facility.To determine the stability of RAX and PKR, cycloheximide (Sigma C7698) was added to cell lines at 30 μg/ml to inhibit protein synthesis. After 24 h of cycloheximide treatment, cells were ∼70% viable. The level of PKR and RAX present in the cells at the indicated times was determined by Western blot and quantified by densitometry analysis as described.PKR Activity Assay—PKR activity was determined using an autophosphorylation assay. Cells were washed to remove IL-3, and lysates from 2.5 × 106 cells were prepared with GLB at the appropriate times as described. An antibody to PKR was added to the lysates (5 μl, M-515, Santa Cruz) along with 50 μl of protein A-agarose conjugate and incubated at 4 °C for two hours. Immunoprecipitated protein was washed twice with GLB and twice with a kinase buffer (KB) containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 5% glycerol. Washed beads were resuspended in KB with 20 μm [32P]ATP (10 μCi) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The kinase reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 μlof5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and was boiled for 5 min before separation by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose, and 32P-labeled protein was quantitated by autoradiography. The total PKR was determined by densitometry analysis of the Western blot with a monoclonal antibody to PKR (Santa Cruz B-10).PKR Association and dsRNA Binding—For determination of RAX-PKR association, HA-tagged RAX or RAX(S18A) was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of lysate from H7 cells that had been starved of IL-3 for 4 h using anti-HA-agarose conjugate. Lysates were quantitated by BCA assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting with antibody to RAX and PKR (Santa Cruz D-20). The percent of protein immunoprecipitated was determined as described.To determine whether RAX mutants could bind dsRNA, expression vectors were transfected into COS7 cells, and 2 days later 500 μg of each lysate was incubated with 50 μl of poly(I-C)-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The poly(I-C)-agarose-bound protein was washed three times in GLB and once in phosphate-buffered saline. Bound protein was disassociated by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and measured by Western blotting.Measurement of eIF2α Phosphorylation and Protein Synthesis—At the indicated times of IL-3 deprivation, 1 × 107 cells were lysed in GLB, and 100 μg of lysate was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Western blots using antibody specific for eIF2α and phosphorylated eIF2α (Cell Signaling) were used to quantify the change in phosphorylation versus the change in total protein.Protein synthesis was measured by incorporation of 14C labeled amino acids (Amersham Biosciences CFB104). After IL-3 removal for the indicated time, 2.5 μCi of 14C-labeled amino acid mix was added to 5 × 105 cells and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 volume of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The acidinsoluble fraction was collected on Whatman glass fiber filters (47 mm GF/A), and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting.RESULTSRAX Is Phosphorylated on Serine 18 following Stress—We discovered previously that RAX is phosphorylated in vivo entirely on serine upon stress application to cells (1Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15427-15432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To identify which serine(s) is phosphorylated, we created site-specific alanine substitution mutants for 15 of the 28 serine residues of RAX that are predicted to be phosphorylation targets based on three algorithms (24Gasteiger E. Gattiker E. Hoogland C. Ivanyi I. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 25Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol.

Only 1 of the 15 sites chosen, serine 250, is not conserved between RAX and PACT, whereas the other 14 and their surrounding sequences are identical (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of the 15 epitope-tagged mutants was determined by transient expression in COS7 cells. Two days after transfection, the cells were stressed by serum withdrawal for 2 h in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate, and 32P-labeled RAX was immunoprecipitated. Analysis indicated that all mutants except RAX(S18A) could be phosphorylated (Fig. 1B). The mutation of serine 18 to alanine results in a greater than 90% loss of phosphorylation, whereas the mutation of the other 14 serines did not significantly affect the overall level of RAX phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we conclude that RAX is phosphorylated in vivo exclusively on serine 18.Expression of RAX(S18A) in Factor-dependent Hematopoietic Cells Is Associated with a Reduced Rate of Apoptosis following IL-3 Deprivation—To test the functional significance of RAX phosphorylation, clones of cells stably expressing RAX or RAX(S18A) were established in both IL-3 dependent NFS/N1.H7 (H7) and Il-3 responsive BaF3 cells. Consistent with our previous observations with RAX, stable expression of RAX(S18A) has no effect on doubling time or cell cycle distribution in the cell types examined (1Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15427-15432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, unlike RAX, the RAX(S18A) mutant fails to be phosphorylated upon deprivation of IL-3 from these cells, confirming the physiological relevance of the serine 18 site (Fig. 2A). The RAX(S18A) mutant is also unable to be phosphorylated following serum deprivation when stably expressed in human lymphoblastic leukemia REH cells. Collectively, these results indicate that RAX is phosphorylated on serine 18 in both mouse and human cells. Because the region containing serine 18 is identical for both RAX and PACT, we predict that PACT will also be phosphorylated on serine 18.Fig. 2Cells expressing RAX(S18A) are protected from death induced by IL-3 withdrawal.A, RAX and RAX(S18A) were expressed as stable clones in NFS/N1.H7, BaF3, and REH cells, 32P-labeled RAX was immunoprecipitated (IP) with an antibody to the epitope tag after a 2-h serum starvation. Phosphorylated protein and total protein immunoprecipitated are shown. WB, Western blot. B, IL-3 was removed from NFS/N1.H7 cell lines stably expressing either RAX or RAX(S18A). At the indicated times, cell viability was determined using trypan blue dye exclusion. C, IL-3 was withdrawn from stable clones of BaF3 cells expressing either RAX or RAX(S18A). Cell viability was determined at the indicated times as above. ♦, parental BaF3; ▴, RAX cl. 9; •, RAX(S18A) cl. 16.

Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15427-15432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In contrast, when the RAX(S18A) mutant is expressed at similar levels to RAX, H7 cells exhibit a delayed rate of apoptosis as assessed by both trypan blue and annexin V staining (Fig. 2, B and D). After 12 h of IL-3 deprivation, 27% of vector-only transformed H7 cells and 40% of cells expressing exogenous RAX exhibit annexin V positivity. By contrast, only 7% of cells expressing RAX(S18A) stain positive. These data indicate that an intact serine 18 site is required for rapid cell death following growth factor deprivation. Importantly, all of the RAX(S18A) expressing H7 clones we have tested, as well as a polyclonal population, exhibit nearly the same resistant phenotype and yield similar results in the following experiments. Therefore, we present data only from a representative clone hereafter.Similar results are also observed for BaF3 cells (Fig. 2C). However, because BaF3 cells are comparatively more resistant to rapid apoptosis following IL-3 deprivation, the expression of exogenous RAX or RAX(S18A) does not appear to have the same magnitude of effect as in H7 cells. Thus, after 48 h of IL-3 deprivation, the expression of RAX in BaF3 cells causes a 15% increase in cell death as compared with parental cells, while RAX(S18A) expression effects a 5% decrease in cell death as compared with parental cells and a 20% decrease in death when compared with RAX-expressing cells (Fig. 2C). The difference noted in the rate of apoptosis between H7 and Baf3 cells following IL-3 deprivation may potentially be attributed to inherent cell type differences.Serine 18 Phosphorylation of RAX Is Required for PKR Activation—Because cells expressing RAX(S18A) fail to undergo rapid apoptosis following IL-3 withdrawal compared with either parental cells or cells expressing equivalent amounts of RAX, we next tested the effect of RAX(S18A) on PKR activation as measured by PKR autophosphorylation (27Gunnery S. Mathews M.B. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1998; 15: 189-198Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The average amount of PKR autophosphorylation relative to total PKR expressed was determined in three separate experiments with each cell line used. Upon the withdrawal of growth factor, PKR is maximally activated at 6 h in vector-transformed H7 cells and earlier, at 2 h, when exogenous RAX is expressed (Fig. 3). By contrast, cells expressing the RAX(S18A) mutant fail to activate PKR to any measurable degree. Therefore, we conclude that RAX phosphorylation is required for the rapid activation of PKR following stress.Fig. 3PKR activation is suppressed by RAX(S18A) expression in NFS/N1.H7 cells.A, PKR was immunoprecipitated at the indicated times from NFS/N1.H7 cells expressing RAX or RAX(S18A) after IL-3 withdrawal and assayed for autophosphorylation activity by the incorporation of 32P. Autoradiography was used to detect 32P-labeled PKR, and the total PKR immunoprecipitated was visualized by Western blot (WB) with an anti-PKR antibody. B, three sets of blots like those shown in A were quantified by densitometry analysis, and the change in the fraction of active PKR/total PKR at each time point was graphed. ♦, H7 vector control; ▴, RAX cl. 13; •, RAX(S18A) cl. 8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)RAX Phosphorylation Does Not Affect Protein Stability and Is Not Required for Either RAX-PKR Association or RAX Association with dsRNA—To show that the differences in response to IL-3 withdrawal observed in H7 cells are caused by RAX or RAX(S18A) and are not because of an inherent difference in protein stability, we measured the half-life of exogenously expressed RAX and RAX(S18A) and compared it to that of endogenous RAX. Cells were treated with cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis, and aliquots were taken at the indicated times to asses the level of RAX by Western blot. Endogenous RAX has a half-life of about 16 h as does exogenous RAX and RAX(S18A) (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, exogenous expression of RAX or RAX(S18A) has no significant affect on the stability of PKR as compared with vector control cells (Fig. 4A). Thus, we concluded that RAX phosphorylation has no effect on either RAX or PKR protein stability and that the difference in sensitivity to stress observed in cells expressing RAX or RAX(S18A) is not because of a difference in protein stability.Fig. 4RAX phosphorylation does not affect protein stability and is not required for either PKR association or dsRNA binding.A, protein stability of PKR and RAX. New protein synthesis was stopped by the addition of cycloheximide. At the indicated times, lysates were analyzed by Western blot (WB) for the presence of PKR and RAX.

Lysates were made from clones of H7 cells either expressing HA-tagged RAX (cl. 13) or RAX(S18A) (cl. 8) 4 h after removal of IL-3.

This suggests that a nuclear event is critical to the normal function of the FA proteins, and the aberrant proteins in the FA-D groups may have a role downstream of the FA complex in the nucleus. However, some have found FANCA point mutants that are expressed, translocated to the nucleus, and are phosphorylated to some extent. Some of these mutants are of intermediate MMC sensitivity (36Adachi D. Oda T. Yagasaki H. Nakasato K. Taniguchi T. D'Andrea A.D. Asano S. Yamashita T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3125-3134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over the years, little information has been found that addresses the regulation of the FA proteins. mRNA or protein levels change little in response to DNA damage or the cell cycle. Our recent work has revealed that at least a subset of the FA proteins resides in the nucleus bound to chromatin, where increased protein binding occurs in response to DNA damage (37Qiao F. Moss A. Kupfer G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23391-23396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). One of the non-core complex FA proteins, FANCD2, becomes monoubiquitinated in response to DNA damage (38Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 249-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown during the cell cycle that the FA proteins detach from chromatin during mitosis, and FANCG becomes phosphorylated while remaining part of the complex (37Qiao F. Moss A. Kupfer G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23391-23396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). One group has demonstrated that FANCG has a isoform seen in asynchronous cells that is phosphatase sensitive (39Futaki M. Watanabe S. Kajigaya S. Liu J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this paper we report the identification of a phosphopeptide from endogenous, in vivo FANCG. The phosphorylated amino acid, serine 7, is functionally important in a way that is evolutionarily conserved between hamster and human. Production of FLAG-FANCG and Mutants—pMMP-FLAG-FANCG was made as previously described (37Qiao F. Moss A. Kupfer G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23391-23396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All PCR were done using high fidelity Taq polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). Primers homologous to FANCG with restriction sites for ligation into pcDNA-CFP were made. PCR was performed on pMMP-FANCG, and the resulting product was restricted and ligated into pcDNA-CFP. Primers homologous to FANCG nucleotides were used in a polymerase chain reaction using a Stratagene QuikChange kit. Each set of primers contained a one-nucleotide difference resulting in the change of amino acid 7. PCR products were sequenced to confirm the mutation as well as to eliminate the possibility of PCR-induced mutations. The resulting pMMP constructs were transfected into 293GPG producer lines, and viral supernatants were collected daily between 3 and 7 days after transfection. Retroviral supernatants were used for subsequent transduction. pcDNA-CFP-FANCG constructs were maxi-prepped using standard techniques (Qiagen). Cells were subsequently transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture—Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. FA-A mutant GM6914 cells, corrected GM6914 + FLAG-FANCA cells, FA-D2 mutant PD20 cells, FA-D2 corrected 20–315 cells, and FA-G mutant cells 326SV were grown in F12 + 15% fetal bovine serum. 293VSV producer cells were grown as described (37Qiao F. Moss A. Kupfer G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23391-23396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were also transduced with pMMP-FLAG-FANCA, and the resulting cells were selected with puromycin. FA-G mutant EUFA143 lymphoblasts were grown in RPMI1640 + 15% fetal bovine serum. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) wild-type cell line AA8 and FANCG/XRCC9 mutants NM3 and UV40 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (40Wilson J.B. Johnson M.A. Stuckert A.P. Trueman K.L. May S. Bryant P.E. Meyn R.E. D'Andrea A.D. Jones N.J. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1939-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Lysate Preparation and Immunoprecipitation—For whole cell lysate, pelleted cells were extracted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotonin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 nm β-glycerophosphate). The extract was tested for protein concentration by the Bradford assay. Two mg of protein in 1 ml of the buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors was incubated with 2 μg of both anti-N and anti-C-terminal FANCA antibodies or anti-FLAG affinity gel for 1 h at 4 °C. 30 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the anti-FANCA immunoprecipitations, and the resulting mixture was rotated at 4 °C for an additional hour. The beads were then washed 3 times in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors and dried. 50 μl of loading buffer was added (28Kupfer G.M. Naf D. Suliman A. Pulsipher M. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed, followed by gel transfer in 25 mm Tris and 200 mm glycine onto nylon-supported nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were blocked for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS and then were incubated in TBS plus Tween 20 (TBS-T) containing primary antibody overnight at room temperature. Filters were then washed in TBS-T, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), washed again, and visualized by chemiluminescence (28Kupfer G.M. Naf D. Suliman A. Pulsipher M. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using FANCG and FANCA antisera, as previously described (37Qiao F. Moss A. Kupfer G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23391-23396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a peptide containing phosphoserine 7 of FANCG was provided by Upstate USA. This crude serum was purified first over a column containing unphosphorylated peptide covalently linked to a matrix (Pierce). The flow through was then passed over a column containing phosphorylated peptide. A specific anti-phosphoserine 7 of FANCG was then eluted from this column with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.5, and neutralized with Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. A FANCD2 polyclonal antiserum (rabbit) was made by providing a FANCD2 fusion protein for immunization (Proteintech), following the procedure described by Timmers et al. (16Timmers C. Taniguchi T. Hejna J. Reifsteck C. Lucas L. Bruun D. Thayer M. Cox B. Olson S. D'Andrea A.D. Moses R. Grompe M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 241-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Densitometry was performed on blots using Scion Image software. In Situ Chromatin Preparation and Internuclear Bridging—Cells grown on chamber slides were first washed in cold PBS. Soluble proteins were removed by extraction in cytoskeletal buffer (CSK: 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm vanadyl riboside complex, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 min at 4 °C. The structure remaining was extensively cross-linked by treatment with 4% formaldehyde in CSK for 40 min at 4 °C. The slides were covered with mounting solution containing 2 μg/ml DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) after washing with cold PBS (37Qiao F. Moss A. Kupfer G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23391-23396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (41Muchardt C. Reyes J.C. Bourachot B. Leguoy E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3394-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For bridging experiments, cells were plated into chamber slides and treated with or without the indicated doses of MMC for 4 days. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyede, mounted with medium with 10 μg/ml DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc.), and mounted under a coverslip. Internuclear bridges were assessed by counting 5 random views, for a total of 500–1000 cells, repeating 3 times per group. For fluorescent microscopy and analysis, an inverted fluorescent microscope (Nikon) was used, with images were captured by digital camera (Hamamatsu). Chromatin Fiber Preparation—Chromatin fibers were prepared according to method of Blower et al. (42Blower M.D. Sullivan B.A. Karpen G.H. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized 48 h after transfection, washed twice with cold PBS, and then suspended in hypotonic solution (75 mm KCl in PBS) for 10 min. Cells adjusted to a density of 1–2 × 105 cells/ml were cytospun onto charged slides (double funnels) at 800 rpm with high acceleration for 4 min, 150 μl of cells per slide. For attached/monolayer cells, 1 × 105 cells/ml were used, and for suspension cultures, 2 × 105 cells/ml. After cytospin, slides were immersed in a Coplin jar filled with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 m urea) for 3–10 min. The slide was slowly lifted vertically from the lysis buffer, and the chromatin was allowed to stream down the slide. After fixation in 4% formaldehyde in PBS-Tween 20 (0.05%) for 20 min, the slides were covered with mounting solution containing 2 μg/ml DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) after wash in PBS. For fluorescent microscopy and analysis, an inverted fluorescent microscope (Nikon) was used, with images captured using a digital camera (Hamamatsu). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—FLAG-FANCA affinity immunoprecipitations were conducted on crude lysates from HeLa + FLAG-FANCA and HeLa + vector. Elutions from the FLAG affinity gel were executed in 0.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline in 100 μm FLAG peptide. The eluate was buffered exchanged into 100 mm NaHCO3. Trypsin digestion and extraction of peptides from the aqueous mixture were performed, as in Shevchenko et al. (43Zarling A.L. Ficarro S.B. White F.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 44Shevchenko A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Peptides were separated on microcapillary columns by reverse phase nanoflow HPLC (Applied Biosystems or Agilent HPLC) with a gradient consisting of 0.1 m acetic acid and 70% acetonitrile with 0.1 m acetic acid on either an Applied Biosystems or Agilent HPLC as described (45Schroeder M.J. Shabanowitz J. Schwartz J.C. Hunt D.F. Coon J.J. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 3590-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Online analysis of the chromatographically separated tryptic peptides was performed by microelectrospray ionization (μESI) interfaced to a ThermoFinnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer. Data-dependent analysis was performed, in which one full MS scan from m/z of 300–2000 was performed followed by five MS/MS scans of the most abundant ions present in the full mass scan (46Eng J.K. Mccormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5386) Google Scholar). All MS/MS scans were performed with an isolation window of 3 Da (precursor m/z ± 1.5 Da) and using 35% collision energy. ProteinFarm in-house software was used as an interface between the raw mass spectrometric information and a data base searching program, SEQUEST (46Eng J.K. Mccormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5386) Google Scholar). After deletion of poor quality, spectra and conversion to .dta file format, SEQUEST was used to search against a FANCG data base. Peptides with a cross-correlation score above 2 and each of those spectra were manually confirmed for protein validation. Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography Enrichment of Phosphorylated Peptides—Immobilized metal affinity chromatography columns were constructed as described previously (43Zarling A.L. Ficarro S.B. White F.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The first column was packed with 8-cm POROS 20 MC (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) and activated with 200 μl of 100 mm FeCl3 (Aldrich). After the sample containing tryptic peptides from the previous section was applied to the column, non-binding peptides were removed by washing with a solution of 100 mm NaCl (Aldrich) in acetonitrile (Mallinckrodt, Paris, KY), water, and glacial acetic acid (Aldrich) (25:74:1, v/v/v). This column was then connected in line to a second fused silica column packed with 6 cm of 5–20-μm C18 (YMC, Wilmington, NC). Phosphorylated peptides were eluted onto the C18 column with 5 μl of 50 mm Na2HPO4 (Aldrich; pH 9.0). The C18 column was disconnected and rinsed with several column volumes of 0.1% acetic acid to remove salts and excess sodium phosphate buffer prior to mass spectrometric analysis. The peptides were then gradient-eluted directly into the ion trap mass spectrometer as described in the previous section. Synthetic peptides were synthesized and analyzed, as previously described (43Zarling A.L. Ficarro S.B. White F.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assays—In vitro kinase reactions were performed by incubation of immunoprecipitated beads and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 25 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm cold ATP). The reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of loading buffer, and the entire contents were run by SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred to membrane (Biotrace) and subsequently exposed to film for autoradiography and immunoblotting, respectively. Cytotoxicity Assays—For human fibroblast lines, cells were plated at 3,000 cells/ml for a total of 15,000 cells in a 6-well dish. MMC was added in the indicated doses. Midway through a 7-day incubation, the cells were washed, and MMC was readded. After the wash, the cells were stained with crystal violet followed by extraction in SDS-methanol. Absorbance was measured by A595. MMC sensitivity in CHO cell lines was determined by clonal survival assays as described previously (40Wilson J.B. Johnson M.A. Stuckert A.P. Trueman K.L. May S. Bryant P.E. Meyn R.E. D'Andrea A.D. Jones N.J. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1939-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For lymphoblasts, 2 ml of cells were seeded into flasks at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml. MMC was added at the indicated doses (0–300 nm) with duplicate or triplicate flasks being prepared for each dose. Following 24 h incubation at 37 °C, a further 2 ml of growth medium was added, along with sufficient MMC to maintain the indicated (starting) dose. This process was repeated for a further 2 days (i.e. the volume of medium in the flask was doubled each 24 h, while maintaining the MMC concentration). After 4 days, 4 ml of the resulting 16-ml cultures were transferred to new flasks. 12 ml of fresh medium containing MMC was added and the cells were incubated for a further 3–4 days. Resulting cell densities in each individual culture were determined by hemocytometer counts (a minimum of four counts for each culture) and normalized to the cell numbers obtained in untreated cultures. Data shown represent the means of a minimum of five independent experiments. p values were calculated using t test. Cell Cycle Analysis—500,000 cells of EUFA143 cells with various constructs of FANCG were treated with 1 μm MMC. After the wash in PBS, the cells were resuspended in 0.1% citrate, 0.03% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 10 μg/ml RNase and analyzed by FACS (47Stonesifer K. Xiang J. Wilkinson E. Benson N. Braylan R. Acta Cytol. 1987; 31: 125-130PubMed Google Scholar). FANCA and FANCG Can Be Phosphorylated in Vitro—Previous work has shown that both FANCA and FANCG are phosphorylated. To demonstrate that FANCG was a phosphoprotein, we immunoprecipitated FANCA using anti-FANCA antibody in whole cell lysate from HeLa + vector cells followed by an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1A). An immune-specific phosphorylated protein was evident at 70 and 150 kDa upon autoradiography. Subsequent immunoblotting of the gel demonstrated that the 70-kDa band represented FANCG. FANCA was detected by immunoblotting as well at the same position as the 150-kDa band seen at autoradiography. This is consistent with previous literature showing that FANCA can be in vitro phosphorylated (48Yagasaki H. Adachi D. Oda T. Garcia-Higuera I. Tetteh N. D'Andrea A.D. Futaki M. Asano S. Yamashita T. Blood. 2001; 98: 3650-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We also immunoprecipitated FLAG-FANCA from whole cell lysates made from GM6914 FA-A mutant cells containing either vector alone or FLAG-FANCA constructs, using anti-FLAG affinity beads and incubated the washed immunoprecipitates in kinase buffer in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP.

Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1-1 (GST M1-1) has now been shown to inhibit the stimulation of MEKK1 activity induced by cellular stresses such as UV and hydrogen peroxide. GST M1-1 inhibited MEKK1 activation in a manner independent of its glutathione-conjugating catalytic activity. In vitro binding and kinase assays revealed that GST M1-1 directly bound MEKK1 and inhibited its kinase activity. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed a physical association between endogenous GST M1-1 and endogenous MEKK1 in L929 cells. Overexpressed GST M1-1 interfered with the binding of MEKK1 to SEK1 in transfected HEK293 cells. Furthermore, GST M1-1 suppressed MEKK1-mediated apoptosis.

MAP3K phosphorylates and activates a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase that in turn phosphorylates and activates a mitogen-activated protein kinase. The mitogen-activated protein kinase family includes extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases (JNKs/SAPKs), and p38 (3Davis R.J.

The carboxyl-terminal region of MEKK1 contains a catalytic domain that binds and phosphorylates SEK1 (24Xia Y. Wu Z. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a group of detoxification proteins that catalyze the conjugation of reduced GSH to various electrophilic molecules. GSTs also function as nonenzymatic binding ligands that interact with a variety of lipophilic compounds including steroid hormones (25Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3214) Google Scholar). The mammalian cytosolic GSTs are classified into five classes based on their primary structure: Alpha; Mu; Pi; Sigma; and Theta (25Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3214) Google Scholar). The Alpha, Mu, and Pi are the major ones among these classes. There are many lines of evidence that GSTs have a protective role against a variety of cytotoxic agents (26Yang Y. Cheng J.Z. Singhal S.S. Saini M. Pandya U. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. J. Biol.

We previously reported that GST M1-1 functions as an endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), a MAP3K of the JNK/SAPK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, thereby suppressing ASK1-mediated cell death (28Cho S.G. Lee Y.H. Park H.S. Ryoo K. Kang K.W. Park J. Eom S.J. Kim M.J. Chang T.S. Choi S.Y. Shim J. Kim Y. Dong M.S. Lee M.J. Kim S.G. Ichijo H. Choi E.J. J. Biol.

To further understand the mechanism underlying the modulation of the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway by GST M1-1, we have investigated a possible effect of GST M1-1 on the components of this pathway and report in this study that GST M1-1 physically associates with MEKK1 and inhibits its kinase activity. GST M1-1, by binding to MEKK1, interferes with an interaction between MEKK1 and its substrate SEK1. Thus, our findings suggest that MEKK1 is a new target of GST M1-1. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and mouse fibrosarcoma L929 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). For DNA transfection, HEK293 cells were plated with a density of 3 × 106 cells/100-mm culture dish, incubated overnight, and then transfected with the indicated expression vectors by calcium phosphate method (30Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4798) Google Scholar) or with the use of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Plasmid Construction—cDNA encoding JNK1 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into p3×FLAG-CMV-10 (Sigma). cDNAs for GST-SEK1(K129R), GST-JNK1(K55R), and GST-c-Jun-(1–79) and mouse cDNAs encoding GST M1-1, GST M1-1-FLAG, HA-GST M1-1, and GST M1-1(Y6F) were described previously (31Park J.

Cell lysates were subjected to microcentrifugation at 12,000 × g, and the resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the use of the indicated antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were rinsed with buffer A and then with 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, and assayed for the indicated protein kinases as described previously (31Park J. Kim I. Oh Y.J. Lee K.

GST-SEK1(K129R), GST-JNK1(K55R), or GST-c-Jun-(1–79) was used as a substrate for MEKK1, SEK1, or JNK1, respectively.

The soluble fraction was subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies. The resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described previously (28Cho S.G. Lee Y.H. Park H.S. Ryoo K. Kang K.W. Park J. Eom S.J. Kim M.J. Chang T.S.

In Vitro Binding Assay—Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged GST M1-1 protein was bacterially expressed and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) as described previously (28Cho S.G.

[35S]Methionine-labeled MEKK1 (MEKK1-s), SEK1, and JNK1 were produced by in vitro transcription and translation using the TnT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 35S-Labeled proteins were incubated with GST M1-1 immobilized onto Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads at 4 °C for 2 h in the binding buffer that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The beads were rinsed with a washing buffer that contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Tween 20. 35S-Labeled proteins bound on the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed with a Fuji BAS 2500 PhosphorImager. Cell Death Assay—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP (Clontech) and the indicated plasmids. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were unexposed or exposed to the indicated agents. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenolindole. The number of cells with apoptotic nuclei was counted among GFP-expressing cells by fluorescence microscopy. The apoptotic cell death was calculated as the percentage of apoptotic cells over total GFP-positive cells. GST M1-1 Inhibits MEKK1 Activity—To investigate whether GST M1-1 regulates MEKK1, HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid vector encoding HA-tagged MEKK1 alone or together with a plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged GST M1-1. The exposure of the transfected cells to UV light resulted in an increase in MEKK1 activity, and this activation was inhibited by GST M1-1 (Fig. 1A). GST M1-1 also inhibited H2O2-induced stimulation of MEKK1 activity (Fig. 1B). In comparison, GST M1-1 did not affect the UV-induced stimulation of MLK3 (Fig. 1D) or TAK1 (data not shown). MLK3 and TAK1 are other MAP3Ks in the JNK signaling pathway (3Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar, 33Schlesinger T.K. Fanger G.R. Yujiri T. Johnson G.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1181-D1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cdc42, a member of the small GTP-binding protein Rho family, has been shown to associate with and stimulate MEKK1 (19Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The overexpression of Cdc42V12, a constitutive active mutant of Cdc42, resulted in the activation of MEKK1 (Fig. 1C). GST M1-1 inhibited the Cdc42V12-induced activation of MEKK1. MEKK1 Is a Direct Target of GST M1-1—We next examined whether GST M1-1 inhibits MEKK1 by directly acting on the kinase. In vitro kinase study revealed that MEKK1 activity was inhibited by GST M1-1 protein but not by another isoform of GST, GST P1-1 (Fig. 2A). In comparison, GST M1-1 did not inhibit either SEK1 or JNK1 activity in vitro (Fig. 2B). Moreover, in vitro binding data indicated that GST M1-1 directly bound to MEKK1 but not to either SEK1 or JNK1 (Fig. 3A). In separate in vitro binding experiments, GST M1-1 also bound a MEKK1 fragment, MEKKK1-s, which corresponds to the amino acids 861–1493 of full-length MEKK1 (data not shown).Fig. 3GST M1-1 physically associates with MEKK1.A, recombinant hexahistidine-tagged GST M1-1 protein was bacterially expressed and immobilized onto Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose beads. MEKK1, SEK1, and JNK1 were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. 35S-Labeled proteins were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with GST M1-1 immobilized on the beads. The bound 35S-labeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed with a phosphorescence imager. B–C, HEK293 cells were transfected for 48 h with expression plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged GST M1-1 and HA-tagged MEKK1 (B) or plasmids encoding HA-tagged GST M1-1 and FLAG-tagged MEKK1-s (C). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG (B) or anti-HA antibody (C), and the resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA (B) or anti-FLAG antibody (C). Cell lysates were also subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. D, L929 cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit preimmune IgG or rabbit anti-GST M1-1 antibody. The immunoprecipitates (IP) were analyzed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-MEKK1 antibody. Immunoblotting (IB) of cell lysates (2% total) was also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments to investigate a physical interaction between GST M1-1 and MEKK1 in intact cells. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged GST M1-1 and HA-tagged MEKK1. Immunoblot analysis using anti-HA antibody of the FLAG immunoprecipitates indicated that GST M1-1 physically associated with MEKK1 in the co-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). The interaction between MEKK1 and GST M1-1 was not affected by the exposure of cells to UV light (data not shown). In a separate co-immunoprecipitation experiment, GST M1-1 physically interacted with MEKK1-s (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, GST M1-1 inhibited the UV-stimulated kinase activity of MEKK1-s in transfected HEK293 cells (data not shown). We next examined an interaction between two endogenous GST M1-1 and MEKK1 proteins in L929 fibrosarcoma cells. L929 cells have been shown to express high levels of Mu class GST proteins (34Townsend A.J. Goldsmith M.E. Pickett C.B. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21582-21590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation data indicate that endogenous GST M1-1 physically interacted with endogenous MEKK1 in L929 cells (Fig. 3D). Taken together, our results suggest that GST M1-1 physically associates with and inhibits MEKK1. GST M1-1 Interferes with an Interaction between MEKK1 and SEK1—Given that GST M1-1 physically interacts with MEKK1, we investigated whether GST M1-1 could disrupt the binding of MEKK1 to its substrate SEK1. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-MEKK1 and SEK1-FLAG in the absence or the presence of the GST M1-1 construct. A co-immunoprecipitation study showed that MEKK1 physically interacted with SEK1 in the transfected cells and that this interaction was inhibited by GST M1-1 (Fig. 4A). In comparison, GST M1-1 did not inhibit an interaction between ASK1 and SEK1. GST M1-1 did not affect the binding of MEKK1 to JNK1 (Fig. 4B). MEKK1 has been shown to form the scaffold complex by physically associating with SEK1 and JNK (35Whitmarsh G. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). GST M1-1 Inhibits MEKK1 Activity Independently of Its GSH-conjugating Activity—GST M1-1 is an enzyme that catalyzes a conjugation of GSH to a substrate compound. The tyrosine residue in the sixth amino acid position of murine GST M1-1 is thought to be critical for the enzymatic activity (36Lee H.C. Toung Y.P. Tu Y.S. Tu C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 37Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Schaffer J. Gallay O. Huber R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the inhibitory action of GST M1-1 on MEKK1 requires the catalytic activity of GST M1-1, HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-MEKK1 and wild-type GST M1-1 or GST M1-1(Y6F) and examined for UV-induced MEKK1 activation. GST M1-1(Y6F) is a catalytically inactive mutant of GST M1-1. GST M1-1(Y6F) inhibited the UV-stimulated kinase activity of MEKK1 as effectively as wild-type GST M1-1 did (Fig. 5). Thus, these results suggest that the GSH-conjugating activity of GST M1-1 is dispensable for the inhibitory action of it on MEKK1. GST M1-1 Inhibits MEKK1-mediated Apoptosis—MEKK1 has been shown to be required for JNK activation and cell death induced by microtubule-disrupting agents such as nocodazole (38Kwan R. Burnside J. Kurosaki T. Cheng G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7183-7190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether GST M1-1 inhibits the nocodazole-induced stimulation of MEKK1 and JNK1 activities as well as apoptotic cell death (Fig. 6). Nocodazole treatment enhanced the kinase activities of MEKK1 (Fig. 6A) and JNK1 (Fig. 6B), and these activations were suppressed in the cells expressing ectopic GST M1-1. The exposure of HEK293 cells to nocodazole also resulted in a marked increase in apoptotic cell death. The nocodazole-induced apoptosis was inhibited by MEKK1(K1253M), a dominant-negative mutant of MEKK1, but not by a dominant-negative mutant of ASK1 (ASK1(K709R)) (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that MEKK1 mediates nocodazole-induced apoptosis. The ectopic expression of GST M1-1 suppressed nocodazole-induced apoptosis. Overexpressed GST M1-1 also inhibited UV-induced apoptosis. GST catalyzes the conjugation of reduced glutathione to electrophilic xenobiotics or products of oxidative stresses. It also non-enzymatically binds a variety of compounds that include thyroid hormones, heme, bilirubin, bile acids, steroids, and fatty acids (25Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3214) Google Scholar). Aside from being involved in drug metabolism and detoxification processes, several isoforms of GSTs appear to modulate the intracellular signaling events induced by cellular stresses. The Pi class GST directly interacts with JNK as a monomer at the non-stressed state, thereby keeping a basal JNK activity low (29Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). GST A2-2 inhibits the hydrogen peroxide-stimulated activities of JNK and caspase-3 as well as hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in human K562 cells (26Yang Y. Cheng J.Z. Singhal S.S. Saini M. Pandya U. Awasthi S. Awasthi Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19220-19230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We previously showed that GST M1-1, by directly binding ASK1, suppresses ASK1 activation and ASK1-dependent apoptosis (28Cho S.G. Lee Y.H. Park H.S. Ryoo K. Kang K.W. Park J. Eom S.J. Kim M.J. Chang T.S. Choi S.Y. Shim J. Kim Y. Dong M.S. Lee M.J. Kim S.G. Ichijo H. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12749-12755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Our findings in this study demonstrate that GST M1-1 physically associates with MEKK1 in vitro and in intact cells and that GST M1-1 inhibits the stress-stimulated MEKK1 activity. In comparison, GST M1-1 does not inhibit MLK3 and TAK1, both of which are other MAP3Ks of the JNK/SAPK pathway. Collectively, GST M1-1 appears to tightly regulate the stress-activated protein kinase pathway by directly targeting two MAP3Ks, MEKK1 and ASK1. Interestingly, GST M1-1 binds the carboxyl-terminal half-region of MEKK1 that contains the catalytic domain and it inhibits the interaction between MEKK1 and SEK1. In comparison, GST M1-1 binds the amino-terminal regulatory domain of ASK1 and it inhibits ASK1 oligomerization (28Cho S.G. Lee Y.H. Park H.S. Ryoo K. Kang K.W. Park J. Eom S.J. Kim M.J. Chang T.S. Choi S.Y. Shim J. Kim Y. Dong M.S. Lee M.J. Kim S.G. Ichijo H. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12749-12755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Thus, GST M1-1 appears to inhibit MEKK1 and ASK1 in distinct manners, although more studies are needed for detailed mechanisms. Regarding a role of MEKK1 in apoptosis induced by microtubule-disrupting agents, our present study shows that MEKK1 mediates nocodazole-induced apoptosis. However, it is noteworthy that targeted gene-disruption studies have shown that MEKK1 can function as either a proapoptotic or an antiapoptotic mediator in different cell types (15Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 38Kwan R. Burnside J. Kurosaki T. Cheng G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7183-7190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). MEKK–/– embryonic stem cells from mice are more sensitive to nocodazole-induced apoptosis, and the ectopic expression of MEKK1 protects the transfected MEKK–/– embryonic stem cells from nocodazole-induced apoptosis (15Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In contrast, MEKK–/– DT40 B-cells from chicken are more resistant to nocodazole-induced apoptosis compared with wild-type DT40 cells (38Kwan R. Burnside J. Kurosaki T. Cheng G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7183-7190Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). More studies are needed to better understand these opposite effects of MEKK1. Taken together, our present findings suggest that MEKK1 is a new target of GST M1-1 and that the inhibition of MEKK1 activation is an integral part of the mechanism underlying the negative regulation of stress-induced signaling by GST M1-1. We thank Drs. G. Johnson, R. J. Davis, L. I. Zon, K. Yoshioka, J. S. Gutkind, A. Hall, and K.

We now show that this effect of ILK involves the c-Jun transcriptional coactivator, nascent polypeptide-associated complex and coactivator α (α-NAC). ILK phosphorylated α-NAC on residue Ser-43 upon adhesion of cells to fibronectin. Co-expression of constitutively active ILK with α-NAC led to the nuclear accumulation of the coactivator. Conversely, α-NAC remained in the cytoplasm of cells transfected with a dominant-negative ILK mutant, and a mutated α-NAC at phosphoacceptor position Ser-43 (S43A) also localized outside of the nucleus. The S43A α-NAC mutant could not potentiate the effect of ILK on c-Jun-dependent transcription. We conclude that ILK-dependent phosphorylation of α-NAC induced the nuclear accumulation of the coactivator and that phosphorylation of α-NAC by ILK is required for the potentiation of c-Jun-mediated responses by the kinase. The results represent one of the rare examples of a transcriptional coactivator shuttling between the cytosol and the nucleus.

These results confirm the key role of ILK as an effector of downstream integrin signaling and as an important regulator of cellular activity. The net effect of stimulating the ILK signaling cascade is to modulate gene transcription. ILK activation or constitutive ILK expression has been shown to stimulate cyclin D1 transcription (7Radeva G. Petrocelli T. Behrend E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Filmus J. Slingerland J. Dedhar S. J. Biol.

Upon activation, ILK phosphorylates its downstream effectors, which include protein kinase B/Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (6Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Activation or overexpression of ILK leads to translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus, where it functions as a coactivator of lymphoid enhancer factor-1/T cell factor-dependent transcription (11Novak A. Hsu S.C. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Radeva G. Papkoff J. Montesano R. Roskelley C. Grosschedl R. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4374-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ILK has also been shown to potentiate homodimeric c-Jun activating protein-1 (AP-1)-dependent transcription (12Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The Jun proteins, members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors, regulate a wide variety of cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and oncogenesis (13Hartl M. Bader A.G. Bister K. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2003; 3: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Jun proteins function as dimeric transcription factors that bind AP-1 regulatory elements in the promoter and/or enhancer regions of numerous genes (14Curran T. Franza Jr., B.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 395-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Jun family members (c-Jun, JunB, JunD) can homodimerize as well as form heterodimers among themselves or with partners of the Fos or activating transcription factor families (15Kerppola T.K.

The following proteins were characterized as coactivators of AP-1-mediated transcription: CBP (cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein) (17Bannister A.J. Oehler T. Wilhelm D.

Moreau A. St-Arnaud R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and of c-Jun homodimers (21Quelo I. Akhouayri O. Prud'homme J. St-Arnaud R.

Yotov W.V. Glorieux F.H. St-Arnaud R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1312-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). α-NAC provides a protein bridge between sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factors and the basal transcriptional machinery by contacting the general transcription factor TATA binding protein (25Yotov W.V. Moreau A. St-Arnaud R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This stabilizes the transcription factors on their cognate response elements and results in enhanced transcription rates (23Moreau A. Yotov W.V. Glorieux F.H. St-Arnaud R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1312-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To exert its coactivation function, α-NAC enters the nucleus (21Quelo I. Akhouayri O. Prud'homme J. St-Arnaud R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2906-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Quelo I. Hurtubise M. St-Arnaud R. Gene Expr. 2002; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Yotov W.V.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2641-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the subcellular localization of the protein is regulated at several levels. Phosphorylation by GSK3β impacts on the half-life of α-NAC, and inhibition of the kinase leads to stabilization and nuclear accumulation of the coactivator (21Quelo I. Akhouayri O. Prud'homme J. St-Arnaud R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2906-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in a manner analogous to β-catenin (27Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). The export of α-NAC from the nucleus also appears phosphorylation-dependent. 2I. Quélo and R. St-Arnaud, unpublished results. Until now, the signal(s) that initiate the α-NAC cascade and tag the coactivator for entry into the nucleus have remained unidentified. In a search for ILK targets, an interaction between ILK and α-NAC was observed. The similarities between the signal transduction pathways involving both molecules, namely the GSK3β intermediate and the potentiation of c-Jun-mediated transcription, prompted us to evaluate whether signaling by ILK impacts on the subcellular localization of α-NAC and its coactivating function. We report that ILK phosphorylates α-NAC on residue serine 43 in vitro and in living cells. This serves as the signal for entry of α-NAC into the nucleus and leads to maximal coactivation of c-Jun-dependent transcription by the α-NAC protein. Plasmids and Constructs—The FLAG epitope was inserted into the pSI mammalian expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield the pSI-Flag plasmid. The cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutated α-NAC (see Fig. 2A) were inserted in-frame into pSI-Flag to yield the pSI-NAC-Flag expression vectors. Full-length α-NAC (wild type) and mutant cDNAs were also sub-cloned in-frame at their C termini with the intein-chitin binding domain of the pTYB2 expression vector (New England Biolabs Ltd., Mississauga, ON, Canada) to give pTYB2-NAC plasmids. 3Subcloning details and vector maps are available on request. Coimmunoprecipitation—COS-7 cells were transfected with the pSINAC-Flag and pcDNA3.1/V5-His-ILK (12Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) expression vectors in the combinations indicated in the legend to Fig. 1. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were lysed in 2× lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2% Triton X-100) with inhibitors of proteases (5 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were diluted with H2O to reach 1× lysis buffer. They were incubated overnight at 4 °C with Sepharose beads conjugated to an anti-Flag antibody (anti-Flag M2 affinity gel, Sigma) or to an unrelated anti-glutathione-S-transferase antibody. The beads were extensively washed in 1× lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were run on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. The blots were probed with an anti-ILK antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and then probed with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Proteins were detected by chemifluorescence with ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was subsequently stripped and reprobed with the anti-α-NAC antibody (55Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assays—Wild-type His-tagged ILK was purified from COS-7 cells stably transfected with the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-ILK expression vector (12Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in MCAC-0 buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml each of the aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin antiproteases, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), and sonicated following 30 min of incubation on ice. The total cell extract was incubated for 2.5 h at 4 °C with 0.5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid slurry (Qiagen Canada Inc., Mississauga, ON) in an Econocolumn (Bio-Rad). The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was then rinsed with 6 ml of MCAC-0 buffer, followed by 3.5 ml of MCAC-20 buffer (MCAC buffer with 20 mm imidazole). The His-ILK protein was eluted from the column with 1 × 2 ml and then with 1 × 0.5 ml of MCAC-200 buffer (200 mm imidazole). It was then pooled, dialyzed against dialysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml each of the aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin antiproteases, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), and concentrated to 100 ng/μl using a Centricon 10 column (Amicon, Inc., Beverley, MA). The recombinant α-NAC proteins from pTYB2-NAC plasmids were produced and purified in Escherichia coli following the manufacturer's procedure (New England Biolabs Ltd.). For in vitro kinase assays, 2 μg of the recombinant α-NAC proteins were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in ILK buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF) with 200 ng of purified ILK and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and then were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel. The dried gel was autoradiographed on X-AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). In Vivo Phosphorylation Assays—COS-7 African green monkey kidney cells were maintained in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and transiently transfected with the GenePorter transfection reagent (5 μl/μg DNA) according to the manufacturer's procedure (Gene Therapy System, San Diego, CA). Cells were transfected with the wild-type pSI-NAC-Flag vector alone or in combination with constitutively active (ILK S343D) or dominant-negative (ILK S343A) ILK expression vectors (12Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). One sample was transfected with the α-NAC phosphoacceptor mutant S43A, and one sample was transfected with pSI-NAC-Flag and treated for 1 h prior to permeabilization with 50 μm of the specific ILK inhibitor, KP392 (56Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). At 48 h post-transfection, the transfected COS-7 cells were permeabilized with 0.6 unit/ml streptolysin O (Sigma-Aldrich) and labeled for 1 h with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), as described by Carter (29Carter N.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 4. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 18.18.11-18.18.19Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in 2× lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2% Triton X-100) with inhibitors of phosphatases (2 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate) and of proteases (5 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were diluted with H2O to reach 1× lysis buffer. The radiolabeled cell extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma). The affinity gels were washed extensively in 1× lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-sample buffer in the absence of dithiothreitol. Immunoprecipitates were run on 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was subsequently dried and exposed at -80 °C. The intensity of the signals was quantified using a Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). To control for protein expression levels, one-third of the lysates were run onto a 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked and incubated with the anti-NAC antibody (55Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After washes, the membrane was incubated with the anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). The signal was revealed with the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified with the Typhoon PhosphorImager. Phosphorylation signals were normalized to the protein expression levels, and the relative signal calculated for wild-type α-NAC-Flag was arbitrarily assigned the value of 100%. Normalized phosphorylation signals for the other samples were expressed as a percentage of the α-NAC-Flag signal. Phospho-Ser-43-specific Antibody—A peptide corresponding to α-NAC residues 35-46 was synthesized with a phosphoserine residue at relative position 43, coupled to ovalbumin, and used to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies following standard protocols. The antiserum was depleted of nonspecific immunoglobulins by purification against the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide (57Bangalore L. Tanner A.J. Laudano A.P. Stern D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11637-11641Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) coupled to SulfoLink gel (Pierce). Adhesion Assays—Confluent plates of COS-7 cells were trypsinized, and the trypsin was inhibited with 1 mg of trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Cells were resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 9 × 105 cells/ml. Tissue culture plates (p100) were coated for 15 min with 2 ml of a fresh solution of fibronectin at 20 μg/ml; the fibronectin solution was then aspirated and the plates were left to air dry. Cells (2 ml) were added and left to adhere for the indicated times. Control cells were left in suspension for the duration of the experiment. Plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the adherent cells were recovered in 0.4 ml of 2× lysis buffer. The samples were subsequently diluted to 1× with water. An equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the samples were migrated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and probed with the phospho-Ser-43-specific antibody (1:100 dilution). After washes, the membrane was incubated with the anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). The signal was revealed with the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was stripped according to the manufacturer's protocol and reprobed with the anti-NAC antibody (55Yotov W.V. St-Arnaud R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells were transfected as described above with the constitutively active (ILK S343D) or dominant-negative (ILK S343A) ILK expression vectors (12Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) alone or in combination with the wild-type pSI-NAC-Flag vector or an expression vector for the Flag-epitope-tagged α-NAC phosphoacceptor mutant S43A. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Following blocking with 1% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20, the cells were incubated with the anti-Flag M2 antibody (1:200; Sigma) and a monoclonal anti-V5 tag antibody (1:200; Invitrogen). The cells were then incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (dilution 1:500) to reveal the V5-tagged ILK molecules and a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (dilution 1:500) to detect Flag-tagged recombinant α-NAC proteins. Cover-slips were mounted in Vectashield (with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). All results were visualized on a Leica DM-R microscope at ×400 and digital images were acquired using a Leica DC300F digital camera with the Leica IM50 image management software. Transcription Assays—The COS-7 cells were transiently transfected as described above. Plasmids used were from the PathDetect c-Jun trans-reporting system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA): 500 ng of pFR-Luc reporter plasmid containing five Gal4 binding sites fused to the luciferase gene, 50 ng of pFA2c-Jun (c-Jun-Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion), 500 ng of expression vectors for wild-type α-NAC or the S43A phosphoacceptor point mutant, together with 500 ng of the constitutively active form of ILK (pcDNA3.1/V5-His-ILK S343D) (12Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Negative controls included pFC2-DNA binding domain (expressing the unfused Gal4 DNA binding domain) and corresponding empty vectors. Transfections were carried out for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Subsequently, the cells were lysed for 20 min in the reporter gene assay lysis buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 20 μl of cell lysate was used for single luciferase reporter assays following the manufacturer's procedure (Promega) and analyzed with a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). All assays were normalized with protein concentrations determined by a Bradford assay, and the presence of the transfected α-NAC proteins was controlled by immunoblotting with the anti-Flag M2 antibody (data not shown). Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance and the Tukey posttest. p < 0.05 was accepted as significant. α-NAC Interacts with ILK in Mammalian Cells—The interaction of α-NAC and ILK was first detected using an ILK bait in the yeast two-hybrid protein interaction assay (data not shown) (28Leung-Hagesteijn C. Mahendra A. Naruszewicz I. Hannigan G.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2160-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the two proteins interacted in mammalian cells using co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for ILK and Flag epitope-tagged α-NAC, and the recombinant α-NAC protein was immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against the epitope tag. Under the conditions used, ILK was co-immunoprecipitated with α-NAC-Flag (Fig. 1, lane 3). ILK was not immunoprecipitated when an unrelated antibody was used (lane 1), and the anti-Flag antibody did not immunoprecipitate ILK when α-NAC-Flag was transfected alone (lane 2). These results show that α-NAC interacts with ILK in mammalian cells. α-NAC Is an ILK Substrate—To determine whether ILK could phosphorylate α-NAC, the wild-type α-NAC protein, deletion and point mutants (Fig. 2A) were produced and purified in E. coli using pTYB2-based expression vectors, which yield recombinant proteins devoid of an associated fusion moiety. The recombinant proteins were used for in vitro kinase assays with wild-type His-tagged ILK purified from COS-7 cells stably transfected with the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-ILK expression vector (12Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The purified ILK preparation was devoid of contaminants that could be phosphorylated by ILK (Fig. 2B, lane 1), and ILK did not phosphorylate the negative control maltose-binding protein purified by the same method as the α-NAC mutants (lane 9). The results of the kinase assay show that α-NAC was a substrate of ILK in vitro (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Deleting residues 179-215 (mutant Δ179-215, lane 3), 4-25 (mutant Δ4-25, lane 4), 46-69 (mutant Δ46-69, lane 6), or 69-80 (mutant Δ69-80, lane 7) did not affect phosphorylation of the recombinant proteins by ILK (Fig. 2B). Deleting residues 4-45 from the α-NAC protein, however, resulted in an almost complete lack of phosphorylation of mutant Δ4-45 by ILK (lane 5), suggesting that the ILK phosphoacceptor site within the α-NAC protein was located between residues 26 and 45. Edman sequencing of recombinant α-NAC kinased by ILK in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP showed that the radioactive tracer eluted at cycle 43, a serine residue (not shown). A point mutation was engineered to replace residue Ser-43 by an alanine residue (mutant S43A). The recombinant S43A point mutant was poorly phosphorylated by ILK in the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2B, lane 8), confirming that it is the main ILK phosphoacceptor site within the α-NAC protein sequence. We next tested whether α-NAC was a substrate of ILK in cells (Fig. 2C). Wild-type or mutant α-NAC-Flag in COS-7 cells was transfected in the presence or absence of ILK expression vectors or ILK inhibitors, and metabolic labeling of the intact cells was performed with [γ-32P]ATP after permeabilization. Labeling of phosphoproteins in permeabilized, intact cells is a powerful experimental approach to study protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation reactions and identify relevant substrates (29Carter N.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 4. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 18.18.11-18.18.19Google Scholar). The phosphorylation levels were measured by PhosphorImager and controlled for protein expression levels (data not shown). Wild-type α-NAC is phosphorylated in intact cells (21Quelo I. Akhouayri O. Prud'homme J. St-Arnaud R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2906-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and this level of phosphorylation was arbitrarily set at 100% (Fig. 2C). Co-transfecting a constitutively active ILK molecule (12Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) with α-NAC increased the phosphorylation of α-NAC (Fig. 2C, ILK S343D). Mutating residue Ser-43 to an alanine (mutant S43A) significantly reduced the phosphorylation level of the protein in cells. The reduction in phosphorylation observed in mutant S43A matched the inhibition observed in the presence of an ILK inhibitor (KP392) or in the presence of a dominant-negative ILK mutant (ILK S343A) (12Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data confirm that α-NAC was a substrate of ILK in living mammalian cells. Induction of α-NAC Phosphorylation upon Cell Adhesion—We raised an antibody directed against the ILK-phosphorylated form of α-NAC (Ser-43-phosphorylated) and used it to assay the phosphorylation status of the coactivator following engagement of integrin receptors by extracellular matrix components. Fig. 3 shows that α-NAC was not phosphorylated on residue Ser-43 when cells were maintained in suspension. Upon adhesion of the cells to fibronectin, there was a transient increase in Ser-43-phosphorylated α-NAC that peaked at 40 min postadhesion (Fig. 3, lanes 2-5). The total amount of α-NAC did not vary whether the cells were in suspension or adhered to fibronectin (Fig. 3, low"

Collagen IV is a major protein component of basement membranes, a specialized form of extracellular matrix underlying epithelia that compartmentalizes tissues and provides molecular signals for influencing cell behavior. The collagen IV family is composed of six α-chains (α1 to α6) that assemble into three kinds of triple-helical protomers (1Hudson B.G. Tryggvason K. Sundaramoorthy M. Neilson E.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2543-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar).

Protomers self-assemble into networks by end-to-end associations that connect four molecules at the N terminus, forming a 7S tetramer, and two molecules at the C terminus, forming a NC1 domain hexamer (1Hudson B.G.

Three types of networks are known: an α1.α2 network present in the basement membranes of all metazoa and an α3.α4.α5 network and an α1.α2-α5.α6 network that have restricted distributions. The networks are essential for tissue function, because they provide mechanical stability, provide a scaffold for assembly of other macro-molecules, and serve as ligands for integrins (1Hudson B.G.

The specificity for chain selection is governed by recognition sequences encoded within NC1 domains of the respective six α-chains (4Sundaramoorthy M. Meiyappan M. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

In protomer assembly, the NC1 domains (monomers) of three chains interact, forming an NC1 trimer, to select and register chains for triple-helix formation. In network assembly, the NC1 trimers of two protomers interact, forming an NC1 hexamer structure, to select and connect protomers. This trimer-trimer interface is stabilized by a putative covalent cross-link, which may exist in all three collagen IV networks (6Than M.E. Henrich S. Huber R. Ries A. Mann K. Kuhn K. Timpl R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).The existence of cross-links (reducible and nonreducible) was first proposed from studies of the NC1 hexamer isolated by collagenase digestion of α1.α2 collagen IV networks of human placenta, aorta, and mouse tumor (7Siebold B.

Biochem. 1984; 139: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to acidic pH or denaturants, the NC1 hexamer dissociates into monomers and dimers, the later reflecting the cross-links. Subsequent studies of α1.α2, α3.α4.α5, and α1.α2-α5.α6 collagen IV networks have shown that the cross-links connect α1-like monomers (α1-α1, α1-α5, and α3-α5) and α2-like monomers (α2-α2, α2-α6, and α4-α4) (9Borza D.B.

However, the recent x-ray crystal structures of the NC1 hexamers of bovine lens capsule basement membrane (LBM) and human placenta basement membrane (hPBM), determined independently by us (4Sundaramoorthy M.

Both hexamers showed only intrachain disulfides with no possibility of forming interchain disulfides without destabilizing the two trimeric caps of the hexamer. For the nonreducible cross-link, a novel thioether cross-link was reported by Than et al. (6Than M.E. Henrich S. Huber R. Ries A. Mann K. Kuhn K. Timpl R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Bode W. Proc.

The existence of this novel thioether cross-link is surprising given that the NC1 hexamer of Hydra vulgaris collagen IV dissociates into both monomers and dimers but is devoid of the equivalent Met and Lys residues (12Sarras Jr., M.P.

Instead, it has glutamate residues at these positions.In the present study, the chemical nature of the putative Met-Lys cross-link was further investigated. This was achieved by (a) increasing the diffraction resolution of crystals of hexamers of bovine placenta basement membrane (PBM) and of lens capsule basement membrane (LBM) to 1.5 Å and comparing their structures, (b) mass spectrometric analysis of monomer and nonreducible dimer subunits of PBM hexamers, and (c) hexamer dissociation and re-association studies. The findings rule out the novel Met-Lys cross-link, as well as other covalent cross-links, but reveal the existence of metal ions that may reinforce the stability of the trimer-trimer interface. Also, this study establishes that the nonreducible dimer is an inherent structural feature of a subpopulation of hexamers. The dimer reflects the reinforced stabilization, by noncovalent forces, of the connection between two adjoining protomers of a network. The reinforcement extends to other types of collagen IV networks, and it underlies the cryptic nature of a B-cell epitope of the α3.α4.α5 hexamer, implicating the stabilization event in the etiology and pathogenesis of Goodpasture autoimmune disease (27Borza B.

Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14088-14094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystals of LBM hexamers were grown according to Sundaramoorthy et al. (4Sundaramoorthy M.

The crystallization medium contained 10% polyethylene glycol 20,000, 0.1 m bicine, pH 9.0, and 5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. The crystals belong to the P21 space group with four hexamers in the asymmetric unit. The PBM hexamer crystals were grown using the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method at nearly identical conditions, except that 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol was replaced by dioxane. However, the PBM protein crystallized differently in the P212121 space group with one hexamer in the asymmetric unit. Complete datasets extending to 1.5 Å for both LBM and PBM hexamer crystals were collected at cryogenic temperature at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, beamline 9-1 (Mar365 imaging plate) and Advanced Photon Source, Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) beamline (MarCCD), respectively, and processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK of the HKL2000 suite (15Otwinowski Z.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The 2.0-Å resolution LBM hexamer coordinates (PDB accession code: 1M3D, chains A–F) were used as the search model in the molecular replacement calculations. The calculations were performed using the AmoRe (16Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) program of the CCP4 suite, which provided solution for one hexamer in the case of PBM crystal and four hexamers for LBM crystal. Initial models were subjected to rigid body refinement using 30.0–3.0 Å data followed by simulated annealing refinement using reflections in 10.0- to 2.5-Å resolution range. This and subsequent refinements were carried out using CNS (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar) and cross-validated by the calculation of Rfree using 5% of randomly selected reflections. After this stage, few rounds of positional and individual B-factor refinements were carried out while gradually increasing the resolution to 2.0 Å. From this point each round of positional and B-factor refinements were followed by the addition of solvent molecules using the standard criteria. Adjustments of models were made at the end of each refinement cycle guided by 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc maps using O graphics software (18Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). These iterative processes were continued until the highest resolution of 1.5 Å was reached for both data sets, and all the model errors were satisfactorily corrected, including solvent modeling. In the final rounds of refinement, nonbonded energy restraints for the side chains of Met93/90 and Lys211/209 were removed. The refined models were analyzed using SETOR (19Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graphics. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar), PROCHECK (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar), and the Internet-based protein-protein interaction server (www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server/).Gel Electrophoresis and Chromatography—Crystals of both PBM and LBM hexamers were harvested separately in their artificial mother liquors. The crystals were washed thoroughly in fresh mother liquor to remove uncrystallized protein. Clean crystals were redissolved in buffer and used in electrophoresis and chromatography analyses. Polyacrylamide gels of 4–20% linear gradient (Bio-Rad) were used. PBM and LBM hexamers were boiled in sample buffer for 5 min before loading. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For chromatography analyses, PBM and LBM hexamers were boiled for 10 min in 4 m guanidine-HCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Dimers and monomers were separated using a TSK-G3000sw ToSo-Hass HPLC column equilibrated with 4 m guanidine-HCl.Dissociation and Re-assembly of NC1 Domain Hexamers—NC1 hexamers of LBM and PBM were dissociated in 50 mm formic acid buffered at pH 3.0 with Tris base (5Boutaud A. Borza D.-B. Bondar O. Gunwar S. Netzer K.-O. Singh N. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30716-30724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Under this condition the dissociation into monomers and dimers occurred, as verified by using TSK-G3000 ToSo-Hass HPLC gel filtration column. The dimer and monomer fractions were separated and used for re-assembly studies. The pure monomer (LBM) and dimer (PBM) fractions were re-associated separately by changing the buffer to TBS, pH 7.5. The sample was concentrated to about 1 mg/ml and incubated for 24 h at room temperature. The re-assembled hexamers were analyzed by HPLC gel filtration and by SDS-PAGE.Mass Spectrometry—PBM hexamers were denatured in 4 m guanidine-HCl and 50 mm dithiothreitol by boiling in a water bath for 20 min, and subsequently alkylated with 0.25 m iodoacetamide. Dimers and monomers were size-separated by HPLC in 4 m guanidine-HCl. Each fraction was digested with sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) at 1:25 enzyme to protein ratio by incubating overnight at room temperature. Tryptic peptides were Zip-Tip (Millipore)-cleaned and combined with a α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid matrix for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis using a Voyager 4700 mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The peptides were initially identified by comparing the experimental masses of each peak with computer-predicted masses of tryptic peptides from the bovine α1 NC1 (IV) and α2 NC1 (IV) sequences (4Sundaramoorthy M. Meiyappan M. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31142-31153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The identity of some peptide sequences was confirmed by inducing ion fragmentation using the instrument in the tandem mode (MS/MS).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPreviously, the crystal structures of NC1 hexamers from LBM and hPBM were refined at 2.0 Å and 1.9 Å, respectively (4Sundaramoorthy M. Meiyappan M. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31142-31153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Than M.E. Henrich S. Huber R. Ries A. Mann K. Kuhn K.

The two structures are virtually identical except for the amino acid differences between the bovine and human sequences. The only other difference that distinguishes the two structures is a set of partial Met-Sδ-Lys-Cϵ thioether cross-links at the hexamer interface reported for hPBM structure (6Than M.E. Henrich S. Huber R. Ries A. Mann K. Kuhn K. Timpl R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which, however, is completely absent in LBM structure (4Sundaramoorthy M. Meiyappan M. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31142-31153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The partial cross-links were modeled in hPBM structure based on residual electron density peaks observed between the side chains of Met93 and Lys211 belonging to two opposing α-chains. In this context, we crystallized bovine PBM hexamer as well as LBM hexamer to obtain higher resolution diffraction data for more accurate refinement of the model, especially of the Met-Lys pairs at the hexamer interface. The crystals were also redissolved in the buffer and used in all other experiments. The use of crystallized protein in all experiments provides an unambiguous correlation of the results from x-ray crystallography, electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry.Structure Refinement—PBM and LBM hexamers crystallized using nearly identical conditions pack in two different lattice forms. The former packs in an orthorhombic lattice (P212121) with only one hexamer in the asymmetric unit and the latter in a monoclinic space group (P21) with four hexamers in the asymmetric unit. Both crystal forms diffracted to higher resolutions than previously reported, and datasets extending to 1.5 Å were collected from a single crystal for each protein. The structures were solved by molecular replacement method and were refined to Rfactor/Rfree of 0.175/0.199 and 0.190/0.218 for PBM and LBM crystals, respectively. Summaries of data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Table I. The final model of PBM crystal structure consists of 1 hexamer comprising chains A–F, 8 cations, 6 anions, and 708 solvent molecules and that of LBM crystal consists of 4 hexamers comprising chains A–X, 16 cations, 24 anions, and 3044 solvent molecules.Description of Overall Structure—The backbone atoms of four hexamers of the LBM crystal asymmetric unit superimpose with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.73–0.76 Å. Similarly, the superimposition of PBM hexamer on different LBM hexamer backbones results in an r.m.s. deviation of 0.75–0.79 Å for the backbone atoms. These figures indicate that there are no significant differences in the overall structures within or between the two crystal forms. The two different crystal packings show no obvious structural differences in the crystal contact regions. Fig. 1 shows the ribbon diagram depicting the overall architecture of a typical NC1 hexamer (PBM). Overall, the NC1 hexamer forms a compact ellipsoid-shaped structure formed by two trimers related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry. The hexamer or trimer-trimer interface is formed by a large flat surface covering about 4000 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area. Each trimer is made up of two α1 chains and one α2 chain related by a pseudo 3-fold symmetry. The monomers within a trimer interact very tightly through three-dimensional domain swapping interactions to form a stable scaffold of six-strand antiparallel β-sheet with a two-strand β-hairpin of one chain inserting into the adjacent chain (4Sundaramoorthy M. Meiyappan M. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31142-31153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Additionally, the three monomer-monomer interfaces contain unique sites of interaction that provide basis for chain-specific assembly of the trimer. The NC1 domain of each α-chain contains 12 cysteines, and all of them are involved in disulfide bonds. Each monomer is composed of two similarly folded subdomains, N- and C-domains, which contain three intradomain disulfides each at identical positions. Both LBM and PBM hexamer structures showed only intrachain disulfides. The high resolution crystal structures show disordered N- and C-terminal regions of both α1 and α2 chains. Similarly, post-translational modifications such as glycosylation were not detected in either of the structures.Analyses of NC1 Hexamer Interface: Search for Covalent Cross-links—Instead of disulfide cross-links, Than et al. (6Than M.E. Henrich S. Huber R. Ries A. Mann K. Kuhn K. Timpl R. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) reported the occurrence of a novel thioether cross-link involving a methionine (Met93) and a lysine (Lys211) in the structure of the hPBM hexamer. These residues are contributed by two different chains of two interacting trimers and are located at the hexamer interface. They were modeled in two sets of conformations based on the electron density map at 1.9-Å resolution, one unlinked and the other covalently linked. There are two Met-Lys cross-links per pair of chains, and hence six such cross-links per hexamer are possible. The support for the cross-link stems from the observation of a weak positive peak between the two residues in the difference electron density map. They also claimed, without providing details, to have confirmed the cross-linked peptides from the size-separated tryptic peptides of dimers, but not from the monomers. However, superimposition of the 2.0-Å LBM hexamer structure (1M3D), in which cross-links were not detected, with hPBM hexamer structure (1LI1) shows remarkable resemblance, including the location of the putative cross-link-forming residues, Met93 and Lys211 (The coordinates for only uncross-linked conformations of these two residues are available in the Protein Data Bank).Now that the refinement of two structures at 1.5 Å of the same protein (LBM and PBM) from two different tissues, lens capsule and placenta, of the same species are completed, we have superior models for objective comparison. Thus, simulated annealing omit maps were computed for each of Met-Lys pairs in both structures (Fig. 2). The maps do not show continuous density linking the two residues in any of the six possible sites in PBM structure as would be expected for covalent bonds. They appear generally disordered as commonly observed for solvent-exposed methionine and lysine residues in most crystal structures of proteins. However, some pairs show much clearer density for the side chains, and those pairs are clearly away from each other, implying that they do not form covalent bonds (Fig. 2). Refinement of the structures without nonbonded energy restraints for the methionine and lysine residues involved in the putative cross-links did not move the side-chain atoms significantly. In some instances, the ϵ-amino group of Lys211 is within hydrogen bonding distance (∼2.7 Å) from the carbonyl oxygen of Met91 of the opposite trimer. Although, the residues Met93 and Lys211 are indeed the closest pair at the interface as observed in the high resolution structures, there is no significant residual electron density between them to be interpreted as a potential covalent bond. The distance measured between Lys211-Cϵ and Met93-Sδ ranged (for the six putative sites in the hexamer) between 2.5 and 3.5 Å, which is beyond the expected distance of 1.8 Å for a thioether bond (22Ito N.

Thus, the 1.5-Å crystal structures of LBM and PBM hexamers rule out the proposed Met-Lys cross-link reported by Than et al. (6Than M.E. Henrich S. Huber R. Ries A. Mann K. Kuhn K. Timpl R.

The electron density map of PBM crystal showed strong peaks at specific sites in all the six chains. These sites, when modeled with water molecules, refined to the lowest B-factor limit (1 Å2) set in the refinement and still showed strong residual density in difference Fourier map. Corresponding sites in LBM structure show significantly lower density. This indicated that these sites are occupied by electron dense ions in PBM structure rather than water molecules, and it is quite possible that the LBM structure has partially occupied ions or solvent molecules. The high electron density sites could be clearly divided into three groups based on their chemical environment and hence modeled with three kinds of ions. Because there was very little prior knowledge on the nature of the ions, we used certain chemical and crystallographic parameters as the criteria during the trial-and-erro"

Using the bone-related osteocalcin (OC) gene, we have previously shown that Runx2 is required for the extensive chromatin remodeling that accompanies gene activation. Here, we have addressed the direct contribution of the VDR to chromatin remodeling events necessary for regulation of OC transcription using mutational analysis. Our studies demonstrate that both the distal and proximal DNase I-hypersensitive sites characteristic of the transcriptionally active OC promoter are not enhanced in the absence of a functional vitamin D response element (VDRE). Furthermore, restriction enzyme accessibility studies reveal that nucleosomal reorganization of the proximal promoter occurs in response to vitamin D and this reorganization is abrogated by mutation of the VDRE. These findings indicate that binding of liganded VDR in the distal promoter directly impacts the chromatin structure of the proximal promoter. We find that, in the absence of functional Runx sites, the VDR cannot be recruited to the OC promoter and, therefore, the VDRE is not competent to mediate vitamin D responsiveness. On the other hand, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that Runx2 association with the OC promoter is not significantly impaired when the VDRE is mutated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays also demonstrate that basal levels of histone acetylation occur in the absence of Runx2 binding but that the VDRE and vitamin D are required for enhanced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 downstream of the VDRE. Together our results support a stepwise model for chromatin remodeling of the OC promoter and show that binding of the liganded VDR·retinoid X receptor directly impacts both the distal and proximal regulatory domains.

Enhancement of OC expression in response to vitamin D occurs only after basal tissue-specific transcription is initiated by bone-specific factors, and the extent of responsiveness is inversely related to the level of basal expression.Initiation of basal transcription of the rat osteocalcin gene, as well as enhancement by vitamin D, is accompanied by changes in the structural properties of chromatin (13Montecino M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5093-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In proliferating osteoblasts and cell lines that do not express OC, the promoter is uniformly packed in nucleosomes, which suppress transcription. However, in differentiated osteoblasts in which the OC gene is transcriptionally active, rearrangement of chromatin in the promoter region results in the appearance of two DNase I-hypersensitive (DHS) sites. The DHS sites are localized to regions of the promoter that contain important transcriptional elements: the distal site (–600 to –400 bp) spans the vitamin D response element (VDRE), two Runx binding sites and a YY1 binding motif, whereas the proximal site (–170 to –70 bp) includes a Runx element, a C/EBP binding site, and a Dlx5/Msx2 homeodomain motif (15Banerjee C.

These changes in DNase I accessibility are accompanied by changes in nucleosome placement; in fact when OC is being actively transcribed there is a single positioned nucleosome between the distal and the proximal DHS domains (13Montecino M. Pockwinse S. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Treatment of ROS 17/2.8 cells with vitamin D results in significant intensification of the DHS sites, concomitant with increased OC transcription (13Montecino M. Pockwinse S. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the transcriptionally active rat OC gene promoter is associated with acetylated histones H3 and H4 and that acetylation of these histones is increased in response to vitamin D (19Shen J.

Indeed, studies have shown that the bone tissue-specific factor Runx2 interacts with liganded VDR and the histone acetyltransferase p300 to activate the OC promoter (27Sierra J. Villagra A.

Montecino M. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7491-7500Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that liganded VDR transactivates by physically interacting with both the VDRE and the general transcription factor TFIIB, which is an essential component of the transcriptional initiation complex (4Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar, 29Blanco J.C.G. Wang I.-M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Jurutka P.W. Haussler M.R. Ozato K.

Given these examples of cross-talk between the VDR and key transcriptional regulators, it is important to determine the role that the VDRE, and binding of liganded VDR to the OC promoter, may have in the chromatinremodeling process that accompanies OC transcriptional activation.In these studies we demonstrate that the vitamin D response element in the OC promoter influences the nucleosomal organization and the DNase hypersensitivity of not only the distal VDRE region, but also the proximal promoter domain. Although it has been shown that Runx2 and the VDR functionally interact to regulate OC gene transcription, our chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that the VDRE is not essential for recruiting Runx2 to the OC promoter. However, Runx2 is required for vitamin D-dependent VDR association in the OC VDRE. Because we find that mutation of the VDRE abrogates essential chromatin alterations in both the proximal and distal OC promoter, our results suggest that binding of the VDR·RXR complex contributes to the establishment of a remodeled chromatin state that assures physiological, vitamin D-mediated transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Construction of the reporter plasmids pOCZCAT, VDRE mutant (mVDRE originally named mSHE), and mRunx (all Runx sites mutated, originally named mABC) has been previously described (28Javed A.

Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Third Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor2001Google Scholar). For each construct, four 100-mm plates were transfected with 15 μg of the –1.1 OC-CAT plasmid and 5 μg of pCEP-4 (Invitrogen) encoding the hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene. Cells were harvested at 95% confluency and replated for selection in media (F-12 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum) containing 55 units/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem) based upon preliminary killing curves. Resistant colonies (60–75) from each plate were pooled and propagated as polyclonal cell lines. Each pool was expanded until 2 × 108 cells were available for preparation of frozen stocks. Monoclonal cell lines were generated by limited dilution of different polyclonal parental cell lines. Cells were routinely maintained in media containing hygromycin B for measuring CAT activity and responsiveness to steroid hormones and growth factors.Stable cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate and treated with 10–8m vitamin D for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by adding 300 μl of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) at room temperature for 30 min. CAT activity assays were performed as described previously (33Frenkel B. Mijnes J. Aronow M.A. Zambetti G. Banerjee C. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S.

Cells were transfected with DNA in the presence of 7 μl/well of SuperFect (Qiagen) and incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h with occasional swirling. The transfection mix was aspirated, and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated at 37 °C in F-12 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum for 24–48 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 300 μl of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega Corp.) at room temperature for 30 min. Cell lysates were collected and stored at –70 °C or used immediately for CAT assay as described previously (33Frenkel B. Mijnes J. Aronow M.A. Zambetti G. Banerjee C. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S.

Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). ROS 17/2.8 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate, and nuclei were isolated on day 9 by Dounce homogenization (loose pestle) in eight volumes of RSB buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4; 10 mm NaCl; 3 mm MgCl2) with 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. To evaluate cell lysis, an aliquot of nuclei was stained with 0.4% (w/v) Trypan blue 1:1 (v/v).The nuclear suspension was diluted by adding an equal volume of RSB buffer, and nuclei were collected by centrifugation. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in RSB buffer and the DNA concentration was estimated by absorption at 260 nm. Aliquots of 20 A260 units were digested with increasing concentrations of DNase I (0–5 units, Worthington Biochemicals, Freehold, NJ) in a 1-ml final volume for 10 min at room temperature, or with 500 units/ml of restriction enzyme, in their corresponding buffer, for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA, SDS, RNase One (Promega), and Proteinase K (Fisher Biotech, Fairlawn, NJ) to a final concentration of 25 mm, 0.5% (v/v), 1 unit/ml and 200 μg/ml, respectively, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The samples were extracted once with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and twice with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Nucleic acids were precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol at –70 °C for at least 4 h and then resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.8. DNA was digested with BamHI or XbaI (4 units/μg of DNA) to release a 4.3-kb fragment from the endogenous OC gene (14Montecino M. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J.

The digested DNA was extracted with phenol: chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.8. DNA samples (10 μg) were electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose gel (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization probes were prepared by restriction digestion of pOC 3.4 (8Lian J. Stewart C. Puchacz E. Mackowiak S. Shalhoub V. Collart D. Zambetti G. Stein G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The probes were labeled by the random primer method using [α-32P]dCTP and the Stratagene Prime-It II kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C with 1 ng of probe (10–9 cpm/μg specific activity) per 10-cm2 membrane. The blots were analyzed by autoradiography or by using a STORM PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as described elsewhere (36Soutoglou E. Talianidis I. Science. 2002; 295: 1901-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were treated with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. Cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, then collected by centrifugation at 165 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1× Complete, 25 μm MG-132) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Following Dounce homogenization (20 strokes, pestle A), the nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 750 × g for 5 min, resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (v/v) SDS, 1× Complete, 25 μm MG-132), and sonicated on ice to a DNA size of 200–800 bp. For ChIPs using the αVDR antibody, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1× PBS) was used to resuspend and sonicate nuclei. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min and precleared with A/G plus-agarose beads precoated with 2 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Thirty A260 units of the precleared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of antibody, and the immunocomplexes were collected by binding to A/G plus-agarose beads. The beads were washed twice with each of the following buffers: sonication buffer, sonication buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, LiCl buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate) and 10 mm Tris pH 8. The immunocomplexes were eluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% (v/v) SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, adjusted to 200 mm NaCl, and incubated overnight at 65 °C to reverse the cross-linking. Following treatment with RNase One (1 unit/ml) and Proteinase K (20 μg/ml), the samples were purified using a PCR purification kit from Qiagen Inc. One-tenth of the immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA were analyzed by PCR using oligonucleotides described in Table I. PCR amplifications (26 cycles) were performed in the presence of 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP per reaction, and the products were resolved in 4% polyacrylamide gels.Table IPrimers used for PCR reactions Open table in a new tab The antibodies used were: αAcetylated H3 and αAcetylated H4 from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.

To permit quantitation of chromatin alterations, these cells harbor fewer than ten copies each of a 1.1-kb OC promoter fused to the CAT reporter with point mutations in each of the two steroid half elements of the VDRE (mVDRE) (Fig. 1) or in the three Runx binding sites (mRunx (28Javed A.

Although both YY1 and AP-1 binding sites partially overlap the VDRE, the introduced mutations do not affect binding of AP-1 or YY1 to their respective binding motifs (31Aslam F. McCabe L.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We initially tested the ability of vitamin D to induce promoter activity of either the wild type (pOCZCAT) or the mutated transgenes in the chromatin context of each cell line (Fig. 2). The mVDRE-CAT transgene completely lacks responsiveness to vitamin D, confirming the loss of VDRE function and VDR-DNA interaction. In contrast, the wild type transgene shows a 4-fold increase in promoter activity upon treatment with vitamin D (Fig. 2). For comparison, we also examined the stable cell line carrying the mutant mRunx transgene (where all Runx binding sites are mutated). The mRunx transgene has an intact VDRE, yet exhibits a complete loss of vitamin D responsiveness and DNase I hypersensitivity (Fig. 2 and Ref. 28Javed A. Gutierrez S. Montecino M. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7491-7500Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of vitamin D treatment in these cell lines was monitored by measuring secreted osteocalcin levels as a representation of endogenous OC expression. All cell lines presented a 3- to 6-fold induction of the endogenous OC gene in response to vitamin D (data not shown). Thus, these results demonstrate that all cell lines maintain their osteoblastic phenotype and that the loss of vitamin D responsiveness of the mVDRE and mRunx OC transgenes is due to the absence of these functional binding sites.Fig. 2Vitamin D responsiveness of stable cell lines. Loss of vitamin D responsiveness of the rat OC promoter with mutation either in VDRE (mVDRE) or in the three Runx binding sites (mRunx). Five independent monoclonal stable cell lines for each transgene were treated 3 days after plating with 10–8m 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and assayed 24 h later for CAT activity. The CAT values were normalized to total protein in the cell lysate. Each bar represents the mean value of at least three independent determinations for each cell line. The values are plotted as -fold induction (Vitamin D/Control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Mutation of VDRE or Runx Elements Differentially Alters the Chromatin Structure of the OC Promoter—Previous studies from our laboratory have shown the presence of DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the endogenous OC gene and in transgenes of stable cell lines with an integrated OC promoter (28Javed A.

Stein G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 221-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the distal hypersensitive site (DHS II) encompasses the VDRE and because vitamin D induction of OC transcriptional activity results in increased DNase I accessibility of the OC promoter, we examined the effect of the VDRE mutation on nuclease hypersensitivity under basal conditions and in response to vitamin D induction (Fig. 3). Fig. 3A (middle panel) shows the results of DNase I digestion of nuclei isolated from the ROS 17/2.8 cell line carrying the mVDRE transgene. Although the mutated VDRE element no longer binds the VDR·RXR complex (31Aslam F. McCabe L. Frenkel B. van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), both the distal and the proximal DHS sites are present. However, we note that, in contrast to the endogenous wild type OC gene (Fig. 3B), the distal DHS encompassing the mVDRE is relatively weaker than the proximal DHS site (compare controls Fig. 3A, middle panel, and Fig. 3B). Furthermore, although vitamin D treatment results in enhanced DNase I accessibility of the WT OC gene (Fig. 3B and Ref. 14Montecino M. Lian J. Stein G. Stein J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5093-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the mVDRE OC transgene becomes less hypersensitive in response to vitamin D, especially at the distal DHS (Fig. 3A, middle panel). The presence of the DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the mVDRE transgene is in striking contrast to the complete absence of nuclease hypersensitivity of the OC promoter upon mutation of the Runx sites flanking the VDRE and in the proximal promoter (mRunx, Fig. 3A, lower panel). Taken together, these results demonstrate that appearance of the two DHS associated with initial chromatin remodeling during OC gene activation does not require VDR binding to the VDRE. Nonetheless, the altered relative DNase hypersensitivity of the distal and the proximal promoters in the absence of VDR·RXR interaction shows that the VDRE contributes to the normal vitamin D-induced chromatin organization of the OC gene.Fig. 3DNase I hypersensitivity profile of the OC-CAT transgenes and endogenous OC gene.

Middle and bottom panels, nuclei isolated from untreated (control) or vitamin D-treated (10–8 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for 24 h) ROS 17/2.8 monoclonal stable cell lines were incubated with increasing amounts of DNase I for 10 min at room temperature. The DNase I concentrations (units/ml) are designated above each lane of the Southern blot. The DNA was then purified and digested with XbaI to detect the transgene.

https://openalex.org/W2108011559,"We have shown that the two types of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in NG108-15 cells differentially mediate forskolin- and ethanol-induced cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and CRE-mediated gene transcription. Activated type II PKA is translocated into the nucleus where it phosphorylates CREB. By contrast, activated type I PKA does not translocate to the nucleus but is required for CRE-mediated gene transcription by inducing the activation of other transcription cofactors such as CREB-binding protein (CBP). We show here that CBP is required for forskolin- and ethanol-induced CRE-mediated gene expression. Forskolin- and ethanol-induced CBP phosphorylation, demonstrable at 10 min, persists up to 24 h. CBP phosphorylation requires type I PKA but not type II PKA. In NG108-15 cells, ethanol and forskolin activation of type I PKA also inhibits several components of the MAPK pathway including B-Raf kinase, ERK1/2, and p90RSK phosphorylation. As a result, unphosphorylated p90RSK no longer binds to nor inhibits CBP. Moreover, MEK inhibition by PD98059 induces a significant increase of CRE-mediated gene activation. Taken together, our findings suggest that inhibition of the MAPK pathway enhances cAMP-dependent gene activation during exposure of NG108-15 cells to ethanol. This mechanism appears to involve type I PKA-dependent phosphorylation of CBP and inhibition of MEK-dependent phosphorylation of p90RSK. Under these conditions p90RSK is no longer bound to CBP, thereby promoting CBP-dependent CREB-mediated gene expression.

Neurobiol. 2003; 27: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the interaction of PKA and MAPK in mediating responses to ethanol at a cellular level.We have shown that ethanol-induced CREB phosphorylation and gene activation in NG108-15 cells are differentially mediated by the two isoforms of PKA (9Constantinescu A. Gordon A.S. Diamond I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18810-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Type II PKA is activated by ethanol and translocated to the nucleus, phosphorylating CREB. This step is necessary but not sufficient for gene transcription. By contrast, PKA type I is not translocated into the nucleus and does not phosphorylate CREB. Nevertheless, type I PKA is also required for ethanol-induced gene expression. This suggested that PKA type I regulates a downstream cytoplasmic pathway leading to activation of other transcription cofactors, which interact with phosphorylated CREB to induce gene transcription. The cofactor CBP links the DNA-binding factor CREB to the basal transcription machinery. There is increasing evidence that positive regulation (enhancement of cAMP-dependent gene transcription) is attained through phosphorylation of a factor other than CREB, possibly CBP itself. In this study we demonstrate that ethanol-induced activation of PKA type I causes phosphorylation of CBP as well as inhibition of the MAPK pathway. As a result, 90-KDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK), the downstream substrate of ERK, is dephosphorylated and no longer binds to nor inhibits CBP, thereby further enhancing CRE-mediated gene transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except where indicated otherwise.Cell Culture—NG108-15 neuroblastoma × glioma hybrid cells obtained from the cell culture facility at the University of California, San Francisco were grown in 10% Serum Plus (JRH Biosciences) at 37 °C and 10% CO2 as described previously (19Diamond I. Wrubel B. Estrin W. Gordon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1413-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained for 3 days in complete defined medium (20Sapru M.K. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar). On day 3, media were changed and the cells maintained in the absence or presence of 100 mm ethanol for various time intervals. Treatment with 1 μm forskolin was carried out for 10 min. 300 μm Rp-Cl-cAMPS (RpI) or Rp-CPT-cAMPS (RpII) (Biolog) was added 2 h prior to ethanol or forskolin exposure and remained throughout the experiments.Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked in 4% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and incubated overnight with primary antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies for phospho-ERK and polyclonal antibodies for ERK (Cell Signaling Technology) were diluted 1:400. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were diluted 1:250. No fluorescence was detected when cells were incubated with fluorophor-conjugated secondary antibody only.Cell Fractionation—Nuclear fractions were isolated from NG108-15 cells in hypertonic sucrose as described previously (7Constantinescu A. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26985-26991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 9Constantinescu A. Gordon A.S. Diamond I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18810-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The protein content in all fractions was determined by the Bradford Bio-Rad protein assay.Immunoprecipitation—Nuclear or whole cell extracts (0.5 mg protein) were resuspended in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.4 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2% Triton X-100, 1% Ighepal CA-630) and precleared for 30 min with protein A/G-conjugated agarose. Supernatant from a 10-min centrifugation at 10,000 rpm was incubated overnight with either 2 μg of polyclonal anti-CBP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or polyclonal anti-B-Raf antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) and further incubated with protein A/G-conjugated agarose for 1 h. The immunoprecipitate was centrifuged and washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0. All incubations were at 4 °C.B-Raf Kinase Assay—The assay was performed using a kit from Upstate Biotechnology according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, B-Raf immunoprecipitates or recombinant B-Raf was incubated in assay buffer with inactive MEK, inactive ERK2, and magnesium-ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Tubes were then centrifuged, and supernatant was further incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with a mixture containing myelin basic protein as substrate and [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by applying the mixture to P81 filter paper. Filters were washed and counted with a Beckman scintillation counter. The kinase activity was then normalized to the amount of B-Raf immunoprecipitated from NG108-15 cells.Western Blots—Total cell lysates and B-Raf immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (7Constantinescu A. Diamond I. Gordon A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26985-26991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For CBP immunoprecipitates, we used 3-8% gradient NuPAGE Novex Tris acetate pre-cast gels (Invitrogen) to ensure the entry of high molecular weight CBP protein. Blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies against ERK, phospho-ERK, phospho-p90RSK (Cell Signaling Technology), and monoclonal anti-phospho-Ser/Thr and anti-AKAP95 antibodies (Transduction Laboratories), diluted 1:1000. Secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) were horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit (1:1000) for ERK, phospho-ERK, and phospho p90RSK and rabbit anti-mouse (1:2000) for anti-phospho-Ser/Thr and anti-AKAP95. Proteins were detected using a LumiGLO chemiluminescence substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposure to Kodak Biomax film. Scanning densitometry was used to quantitate Western blots using the NIH Image program.Luciferase Assay—NG108-15 cells (5 × 104) were transfected in defined media with 150 ng of the pFC-CRE-luciferase plasmid from Stratagene using Effectene (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. Where specified, cells were also co-transfected with the expression vector encoding for 12 S E1A and a deletion mutant (Δ2-36, a generous gift from Dr. Robert Rooney, Duke University Medical Center). Media were changed 24 h after transfection. To activate CRE-mediated gene expression, the cells were incubated in either 1 μm forskolin or 100 mm ethanol for 10 min, washed, and maintained in fresh media for 5 h before harvesting (10Yao L.

Cell extracts were prepared and luciferase activity measured as described (8Asher O. Cunningham T.D. Yao L. Gordon A.S. Diamond I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Each point represents three separate experiments with six replicate samples for each point.RESULTSIn our previous study we showed that both types of PKA (I and II) are required for ethanol-induced CRE-mediated gene expression (9Constantinescu A. Gordon A.S. Diamond I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18810-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We showed that upon activation, type II trans-locates into the nucleus and phosphorylates CREB leading to gene expression. By contrast, type I did not translocate into the nucleus but appeared to activate a cytoplasmic pathway leading to increased gene expression (9Constantinescu A. Gordon A.S. Diamond I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18810-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These results suggested that phosphorylation of a factor other than CREB might also be involved.Ethanol-induced CRE-Luciferase Activity Requires CBP—The cofactor CBP links the DNA-binding factor CREB to the basal transcription machinery. There is increasing evidence that positive regulation (enhancement of cAMP-dependent transcription) is attained through phosphorylation of a factor other than CREB, possibly CBP itself. Therefore, we asked whether CBP and its phosphorylation are essential for ethanol-induced gene expression. NG108-15 cells were transiently cotransfected with pFC-CRE-luciferase plasmid and a vector encoding 12 S E1A, an adenovirus-transforming protein that inhibits the function of CBP (21Brockmann D. Esche H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 272: 97-129PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with and without ethanol or forskolin for 10 min and luciferase activity measured 5 h later. Fig. 1 shows that treatment with either ethanol or forskolin significantly increases CRE-luciferase activity. Over-expression of full-length CBP inhibitor, E1A, but not a deletion mutant (Δ2-36) that lacks the CBP binding site, inhibited ethanol- and forskolin-induced luciferase activity. In untreated cells expression of full-length E1A or its deletion mutant did not change the basal level of luciferase activity. These results suggest that CBP is required for ethanol- and forskolin-induced CRE-mediated gene transcription.Ethanol- and Forskolin-induced CBP Phosphorylation Requires Type I PKA—There is increasing evidence that phosphorylation of CBP enhances CREB-dependent gene transcription (22Cardinaux J.R.

To determine whether ethanol increases CBP phosphorylation we prepared nuclei of NG108-15 cells incubated in the absence and presence of forskolin or ethanol. CBP, immunoprecipitated from the nuclear extracts, was subjected to SDS electrophoresis, blotted, and probed with antibodies against phosphoserine/threonine. As seen in Fig. 2, A and B, ethanol induces a robust and long-lasting phosphorylation of CBP. At 10 min, the level of CBP phosphorylation induced by 100 mm ethanol is comparable with that induced by 1 μm forskolin.Fig. 2Ethanol- and forskolin-induced CBP phosphorylation requires type I PKA. NG108-15 cells were incubated with 100 mm ethanol for the indicated times, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, Western blot of CBP immunoprecipitates (IP) from nuclear extracts were probed with monoclonal antibodies that recognize phosphorylated Ser/Thr.

We proposed that type I PKA activates a cytoplasmic downstream pathway leading to enhanced CREB-dependent gene expression. Therefore, we asked whether type I PKA is responsible for CBP phosphorylation. NG108-15 cells were preincubated with 300 μm RpI or RpII for 2 h followed by incubation with 100 mm ethanol for 3 h. Type I PKA inhibition reduced forskolin- and ethanol-induced CBP phosphorylation, whereas type II inhibition was without effect (Fig. 2, C and D). These results suggest that ethanol- or forskolin-induced CBP phosphorylation requires type I but not type II PKA.Ethanol and Forskolin Inhibition of ERK1/2 Requires Type I PKA—Although type I PKA is required for CBP phosphorylation and CRE-mediated gene expression, type I PKA is not translocated into the nucleus and does not phosphorylate CBP directly. This suggested that type I PKA regulates a cytoplasmic downstream pathway leading to enhanced gene expression. The MAPK pathway, a major signaling pathway in neural cells that can be regulated by PKA, is implicated in the pathophysiology of alcoholism (12Sanna P.P. Simpson C. Lutjens R. Koob G. Brain Res. 2002; 948: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 14Kalluri H.S. Ticku M.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 439: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Roberto M.

Pharmacol. 1998; 362: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether ethanol affects ERK phosphorylation in NG108-15 cells. Our results indicate that exposure to ethanol causes dephosphorylation of pERK (Fig. 3A, left panel). Similar results were obtained after exposure to forskolin (Fig. 3A, left panel). cAMP activates type I and type II PKA. Therefore, we asked whether type I or type II PKA mediates ethanol-induced dephosphorylation of ERK. NG108-15 cells were pretreated with 300 μm RpI or RpII for 2 h followed by additional indicated times with either 1 μm forskolin or 100 mm ethanol. The results in Fig. 3A, left panel, show that RpI but not RpII reverses ethanol- and forskolin-induced ERK dephosphorylation. Control studies (Fig. 3A, right panel) show that the total amount of ERK is unchanged under these conditions. Therefore, the decrease in phosphorylated ERK cannot be explained by a reduction of total ERK protein. These results suggest that PKA type I is required for ethanol-induced inhibition of ERK in NG108-15 cells. ERK dephosphorylation reversed after 4 h despite the continued presence of ethanol up to 24 h (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, when cells were exposed to ethanol for only 10 min and media then replaced with fresh media without ethanol, ERK dephosphorylation persisted for 4 h whether or not ethanol was continuously present, whereas total ERK remained unchanged (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Ethanol- and forskolin-induced ERK dephosphorylation requires type I PKA.A, Western blot (40 μg of protein) of cell lysates prepared from NG108-15 cells either untreated controls (C) or treated with 1 μm forskolin (F) for 10 min or with 100 mm ethanol for the indicated times in the absence or presence of either RpI or RpII.

C, NG108-15 cells were either untreated (a-d) or preincubated with 100 mm ethanol for 10 min (e-h), after which the medium was replaced and cells were further incubated for 4 h (b and f), 8 h (c and g), or 24 h (d and h). Cells were fixed, blocked, and probed with antibodies against ERK (red) and pERK (green) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All images are ×60 magnification and were obtained with a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal microscope. The data shown are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)It was demonstrated previously that active, phosphorylated ERK resides in the nucleus or cytoplasm depending on its sustained or transient activation, respectively (29Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next used cytochemistry to relate the time course of ERK dephosphorylation to ERK intracellular localization. NG108-15 cells were treated with 100 mm ethanol for 10 min, and media then were replaced with fresh media without ethanol for an additional 4, 8, and 12 h, after which cells were fixed and stained as described in the legend for Fig. 3C. The results in Fig. 3C show that in untreated cells, ERK (red) is localized in the perinuclear area and the cytoplasm, whereas pERK (green) is found primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 3C, a). After 10 min with ethanol, pERK is not demonstrable in the nucleus and only unphosphorylated ERK is detected, primarily in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C, e). With time, ERK phosphorylation is restored and pERK is found again in the nucleus (Fig. 3C, f-h). Untreated cells with only media replacement show no change in ERK activation and localization (Fig. 3C, b-d). These results demonstrate that ethanol induces transient ERK dephosphorylation and translocation from the nucleus in NG108-15 cells.Ethanol or Forskolin Inhibits B-Raf Kinase via Type I PKA—ERK inhibition can be achieved either by down-regulation of kinases up-stream from ERK or by up-regulation of phosphatases. However, because ERK inhibition is PKA-dependent and activation of PKA has been shown to inhibit rather than stimulate several phosphatases implicated in the ERK pathway (30Saxena M. Mustelin T. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Blanco-Aparicio C. Torres J. Pulido R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we favored the first possibility. The kinase immediately up-stream from ERK is MEK. MEK is uniquely activated by the Raf family of kinases (32Houslay M.D. Kolch W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the amount and activity of B-Raf kinase in NG108-15 cells cultured in the absence and presence of 1 μm forskolin or 100 mm ethanol. We first determined that NG108-15 cells express the 95-KDa isoforms of the B-Raf protein (Fig. 4A). The 68-KDa isoform was not detected. Treatment of cells with either forskolin or ethanol did not change the total amount of B-Raf protein (Fig. 4A). However, the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated B-Raf shows a dramatic decrease during the first 4 h of ethanol exposure (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4C shows that the amount of B-Raf in the immunoprecipitates used in the kinase assay is not significantly changed during the experiment. These results suggest that ethanol inhibits B-Raf kinase activity, resulting in decreased ERK phosphorylation. The results presented in the previous section suggested that type I PKA is required for ethanol inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. Therefore, we next asked whether type I PKA is also required for forskolin and ethanol-induced inhibition of B-Raf kinase activity. NG108-15 cells were pretreated with the 300 μm RpI and/or RpII for 2 h followed either by forskolin for an additional 10 min or by ethanol for 10 min or 4 h. RpI abolished forskolin- and ethanol-induced inhibition of B-Raf kinase activity (Fig. 5), whereas RpII did not. These results suggest that in NG108-15 cells, ethanol activation of type I PKA is required for ethanol-induced inhibition of B-Raf.Fig. 4Ethanol and forskolin inhibit B-Raf kinase activity in NG108-15 cells.A, Western blot (40 μg of protein) of cell lysates prepared from NG108-15 cells, either untreated controls (C) or treated with 1 μm forskolin (F) for 10 min or with 100 mm ethanol for the indicated times.

Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first examined the phosphorylation state of p90RSK in NG108-15 cells cultured in the absence or presence of ethanol or forskolin. As expected, treatment of cells with 1 μm forskolin for 10 min significantly decreased phosphorylation of p90RSK (Fig. 6A). Similar results were found with 20 μm PD98059, a MEK inhibitor. Ethanol also induced a transient inhibition of p90RSK phosphorylation, consistent with the results presented in Fig. 3 showing reversible inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by ethanol. In PC12 cells, phosphorylated p90RSK binds to CBP and inhibits CRE-mediated gene transcription (34Nakajima T. Fukamizu A. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Fisher T. Blenis J. Montminy M.R.

https://openalex.org/W2026958540,"Folding abnormalities of the triple helix have been demonstrated in collagen diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta in which the mutation leads to the substitution of a single Gly in the (Gly-X-Y)n sequence pattern by a larger residue. Model peptides can be used to clarify the details of normal collagen folding and the consequences of the interruption of that folding by a Gly substitution. NMR and CD studies show that placement of a (GPO)4 nucleation domain at the N terminus rather than the C terminus of a native collagen sequence allows the formation of a stable triple helix but alters the folding mechanism. Although C- to N-terminal directional folding occurs when the nucleation domain is at the C terminus, there is no preferential folding direction when the nucleation domain is at the N terminus. The lack of zipper-like directional folding does not interfere with triple-helix formation, and when a Gly residue is replaced by Ser to model an osteogenesis imperfecta mutation, the peptide with the N-terminal (GPO)4 domain can still form a good triple helix N-terminal to the mutation site. These peptide studies raise the possibility that mutant collagen could fold in a C to N direction in a zipper-like manner up to the mutation site and that completion of the triple helix N-terminal to the mutation would involve an alternative mechanism.

Abnormalities in protein folding have been shown to play a role in many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, cystic fibrosis, and type II diabetes (1Dobson C.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 68: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 2Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Protein misfolding also occurs in collagen, in which mutations in the repetitive Gly-X-Y sequence result in a variety of connective tissue diseases. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) 1The abbreviations used are: OI, osteogenesis imperfecta; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; deg, degree; GPO, Gly-Pro-Hyp. results from mutations in type I collagen, the major collagen in bone and tendon, whereas Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV results from mutations in type III collagen, and Alport's syndrome is caused by mutations in type IV collagen of basement membranes (3Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The best characterized disease is OI, which presents with a wide range of clinical phenotypes involving fragile bones, depending on the nature and site of the mutation in type I collagen (4Byers P.H.

J. 1995; 311: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In vivo, type I collagen molecules are synthesized in a procollagen form, in which the C-terminal globular propeptides are responsible for chain selection and trimerization. Post-translational hydroxylation of Pro to Hyp residues occurs while the chains are unfolded, which is necessary for triple-helix formation to commence. A distinctive (Gly-Pro-Hyp)5 sequence at the C terminus of the triple-helix domain of the α1 and α2 chains of type I collagen is likely to be involved in the nucleation of the triple helix (6Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Engel J. Eur. J.

Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 369-377Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Following nucleation, the triple-helix conformation is propagated in a zipper-like mechanism from the C to N terminus at a rate limited by cis-trans isomerization of imino acid bonds (6Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Engel J. Eur. J.

Folding of type I collagen is delayed when an OI mutation is present (7Raghunath M. Bruckner P. Steinmann B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 8Culbert A.A. Lowe M.P. Atkinson M. Byers P.H. Wallis G.A. Kadler K.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The most common mutations are single base changes leading to a Gly substitution that breaks the Gly-X-Y repeating pattern in the triple-helix sequence. Replacement of a single Gly residue by another amino acid anywhere along the α1(I) or α2(I) chain of type I collagen disrupts the close packing of the three chains and triggers events that lead to defective mineralization of bones (8Culbert A.A. Lowe M.P. Atkinson M. Byers P.H. Wallis G.A. Kadler K.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Enzymatic digestion studies (7Raghunath M. Bruckner P. Steinmann B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) show that OI mutations result in slower collagen folding rates. In addition, overhydroxylation of Lys residues is observed. Because enzymatic post-translational modifications occur only in the unfolded state, a folding delay at the mutation site would present an increased period of time for the enzyme to act on Lys residues before they adopt a triple-helix structure (8Culbert A.A. Lowe M.P. Atkinson M. Byers P.H. Wallis G.A. Kadler K.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To better characterize folding in normal and mutated collagens, small peptide models of specific collagen regions are studied by CD and NMR (13Baum J. Brodsky B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Collagen sequences with or without Gly replacement mutations can be incorporated into triple helical peptides as long as stabilizing Gly-Pro-Hyp units are included (14Baum J. Brodsky B. Pain R.H. Protein Folding: Frontiers in Molecular Biology. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 330-347Google Scholar). Peptide T1-892, a 30-mer, contains a C-terminal (Gly-Pro-Hyp)4 sequence, modeling the nucleation domain of type I collagen, and an N-terminal sequence of residues 892–909 from the α1(I) chain of type I collagen (GPAGPAGPVGPAGARGPA). Previous studies (12Buevich A.V. Dai Q.-H. Liu X. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4299-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have shown that peptide T1-892 adopts a stable triple helix with folding initiated at the C terminus (Gly-Pro-Hyp)4, which models the directional folding of collagen and provides a system for investigating the consequences of Gly substitutions. Possible folding models for the rod-like collagen triple helix are limited by the linear nature of the conformation. The current paradigm for native triple-helix folding assumes a single C-terminal nucleation event followed by zipper-like, unidirectional folding (6Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 12Buevich A.V. Dai Q.-H. Liu X. Brodsky B. Baum J.

Biol. 2002; 317: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Here, the possibility of triple-helix formation and the nature of the folding were investigated when the (GPO)4 nucleation domain was switched from the C to the N terminus in peptide T1-892. Interestingly, the directional nature of folding was lost when the nucleation took place at the N terminus, but a stable triple helix was formed. Previously, peptides have modeled the folding interference caused by a mutation, such as the failure of T1-892 peptides with Gly replacements to propagate through a Gly to X mutation site (16Liu X. Kim S. Dai Q.-H. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1998; 33: 15528-15533Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To better understand what takes place at the N terminus of the mutation site, the effect of a Gly to Ser replacement in the peptide with the N-terminal (GPO)4 nucleation domain was also characterized. CD Measurements—All peptides were manually synthesized by Syn-Pep Corp. (Dublin, CA) on an Fmoc-RINK (where Fmoc is N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) resin using solid-phase peptide synthesis procedures (17Yang W. Battinenni M. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6930-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The purity and identity of the peptide were confirmed using reversed phase analytical high pressure liquid chromatography (C-18 column) and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. CD spectra were recorded on Aviv models 62DS and 202–01 spectrometers, with a Peltier thermoelectric temperature controller. Samples were prepared at a concentration of 1.0 or 0.4 mg/ml, with peptides dried in vacuo over P2O5 for 48 h prior to weighing. Final concentrations were determined by the absorption at 214 nm (assuming ϵ = 2.2 × 103). Peptides in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, were equilibrated at 4 °C for more than 48 h prior to analysis. Wavelength scans were collected from 210 to 260 nm at 5 °C. For melting transitions, the ellipticity at 225 nm was monitored at a rate of 0.3 °C/min, with a 2-min equilibration time. For folding studies, peptides were heated to 70 °C and then cooled to 5 °C to initiate refolding, and the ellipticity at 225 nm was monitored. Data were collected every 5 s, with an averaging time of 5 s over 3 h. Because the data did not fit well to simple first, second, or third order kinetics, an empirical measurement of folding, t½ (the length of time to reach fraction folded = 0.5), was used to compare samples. NMR Spectroscopy—The peptide solutions for NMR experiments were prepared with 10% D2O, 90% H2O, pH 2.5. NMR experiments were performed on a Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe and pulsed field gradient. Two-dimensional data sets were processed on a Silicon Graphics work station using FELIX 97 (Molecular Simulation, Inc.). Heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy spectra were recorded at 10 °C. 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE and folding experiments were performed as described previously (12Buevich A.V. Dai Q.-H. Liu X. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4299-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For folding experiments, the sample was denatured outside of the NMR spectrometer by heating to 50 °C for 5 min and then immersed in an ice-water bath for 20 s to quickly reduce the temperature to 10 °C. A series of two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired every 3 min at 10 °C. The dead time of the first spectrum was 60 s. Kinetics of folding were monitored by measuring cross-peak volumes as a function of time. The folding experiment was repeated three times, and average intensities were used in the analysis. Normalization of monomer and trimer residues was performed as described previously (12Buevich A.V. Dai Q.-H. Liu X. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4299-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Residue-specific t½ times for the monomer decay were estimated as the time at which the monomer intensity reached the average value between time 0 and the equilibrium value. Peptide Design—Triple helical peptides were designed with two domains. One domain models the unique C-terminal (Gly-Pro-Hyp)4 nucleation sequence, and the other domain is a block of 18 residues (892–910) from the α1 chain of type I collagen. Placement of the nucleation (GPO)4 domain C-terminal to the 892 sequence resulted in peptide T1-892, which has been studied extensively (12Buevich A.V. Dai Q.-H. Liu X. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4299-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here this peptide will be referred to as T1-892c to emphasize the location of the nucleation domain at the C terminus (Fig. 1). Placement of the nucleation domain N-terminal to the 892 sequence results in a peptide denoted as T1′-892n. The sequences within the two domains are numbered independently, and the residues within the two domains are differentiated from T1-892c by numbering with primes (Fig. 1). The central regions of both peptides have identical sequences and differ only in the location of the (Gly-Pro-Hyp)4 cap. A homologous set of peptides was synthesized with Gly to Ser substitutions at the position corresponding to an OI substitution at G901S in α1(I) (Fig. 1). Peptide T1-892c-G10S contains a Gly → Ser replacement at position 10, and peptide T1′-892n-G10S contains a Gly → Ser replacement at position 10′. CD Stability and Folding—CD spectroscopy was used to investigate the conformation, stability, and folding of these peptide sets. Peptides T1′-892n and T1-892c adopt a triple helical conformation at low temperature as seen by the characteristic CD spectrum with a maximum near 225 nm. The CD thermal transitions of T1-892c and T1′-892n are indistinguishable, with melting temperatures of 26 °C (Fig. 2a). This indicates that triple-helix stability is independent of the position of the Gly-Pro-Hyp units. Folding that was initiated by a decrease in temperature from 70 to 5 °C indicated that peptide T1-892c folded slightly faster than T1′-892n at concentrations of both 1 mg/ml ((t½ ∼1600 s compared with t½ ∼1800 s) (Fig. 2b) and 0.4 mg/ml (t½ ∼3525 s compared with t½ ∼4850 s). The concentration dependence of the folding rate reflects the third order nucleation step, which plays a rate-limiting role at relatively low concentrations. Both peptides with Gly to Ser replacements showed triple helical CD spectra but with decreased triple-helix content and stability. Peptide T1-892c-G10S was previously shown to have a decreased CD maximum at 225 nm compared with the parent peptide (mean residue ellipticity 1600 deg·cm2·dmol–1 reduced from 3000 deg·cm2·dmol–1) and a stability decreased from 26 to 15.8 °C (17Yang W. Battinenni M. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6930-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Peptide T1′-892n-G10S also showed a decrease in the characteristic CD maximum at 225 nm, from 3000 deg·cm2·dmol–1 to 1850 deg·cm2·dmol–1. Again, the replacement of a Gly by a Ser caused a significant decrease in stability from Tm = 26 °C to an even lower value, Tm = 13.8 °C. NMR Assignments, Dynamics, and Folding of Peptides T1-892c and T1′-892n—NMR HSQC spectra of T1′-892n showed resonances analogous to those reported for T1-892c. Each labeled residue gave rise to peaks that could be assigned to monomer and trimer forms (12Buevich A.V. Dai Q.-H. Liu X. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4299-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Liu X. Kim S. Dai Q.-H. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1998; 33: 15528-15533Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, a and c). For example, in T1-892c, three distinctive peaks, designated Gly-13T (Fig. 3, a and c, G13T) were assigned to the Gly-13 residues in the three chains of the trimer form, and a corresponding set of three peaks with the same chemical shifts (G13′T) can be seen for peptide T1′-892n. Similar correspondences were noted for the monomer peaks Gly-13M/Gly-13′M and the trimer and monomer peaks of Ala-6/Ala-6′. The labeled Gly in the C-terminal cap region of T1-892c (G[7]) showed similar trimer and monomer chemical shifts to the labeled Gly in the N-terminal cap region of T1′-892n (G[7′]). This indicates that the chemical shift of the labeled position reflects the local chemical environment rather than the residue position with respect to the N and C termini. Heteronuclear NOE experiments were performed to assess the local dynamics on the picosecond-nanosecond time scale for specific residues in both peptides (Fig. 3, b and d). The NOEs are positive for all residues studied and are of similar magnitude. This indicates that peptides T1-892c and T1′-892n are rigid along their entire lengths, suggesting that the placement of the GPO cap does not affect the conformation and dynamics on the fast picosecond-nanosecond time scale. NMR experiments were used to monitor real time triple-helix folding, and half-times were calculated from the kinetic data (Table I). Previous NMR studies (12Buevich A.V. Dai Q.-H. Liu X. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4299-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) indicate a C- to N-terminal folding direction for T1-892c, with Gly-[7] in the Gly-Pro-Hyp cap folding first followed by Gly-13 and Ala-6. The half-times calculated for specifically labeled residues in peptide T1-892c increase in a C- to N-terminal direction, supporting the directional folding. In contrast, when the GPO cap is placed at the N terminus in peptide T1′-892n, folding is no longer in the C- to N-terminal direction. The half-times for the three labeled residues are then very similar to each other, indicating no clear preference in directionality of folding.Table IResidue-specific t½ times (s) of monomer decays of T1-892c and T1-892n peptides (NMR data)ResidueT1-892cT1-892nssAla-6/Ala-6′492 ± 30192 ± 30Gly-13/Gly-13′240 ± 30252 ± 30Gly-[7]/Gly-[7′]138 ± 30228 ± 30 Open table in a new tab NMR Assignments and Dynamics of OI Model Peptides— Previously it was reported that the replacement of the Gly-10 residue by Ser in T1-892c resulted in an asymmetric perturbation of the structure. The (GPO)4 at the C-terminal end of the peptide and the Gly-13 residue C-terminal to the Ser site retain a triple-helix structure. The Ala-6 residue N-terminal to the Ser substitution site and at the Ser exhibits the mobility of a random chain (Fig. 4, a–c) (16Liu X. Kim S. Dai Q.-H. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1998; 33: 15528-15533Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), supporting a peptide conformation that is only partially triple helical. Similar conformation and dynamics studies were carried out on peptide T1′-892n with a Gly to Ser replacement at position 10 (T1′-892n-G10S), at which point the (GPO)4 nucleation domain is at the N terminus (Fig. 4, d–f). In this case, the Gly-[7′] in the N-terminal (GPO)4 domain and the Ala-6′ residue N-terminal to the Ser site form a rigid triple helix as supported by distinctive trimer and monomer chemical shifts and positive NOE values. For residue Gly-13′ located C-terminal to the Ser, the three distinct trimer peaks are lost, and overlapped monomer and trimer peaks with NOE values close to 0 are observed. This supports the presence of some trimer but with a significant loss of rigidity and triple-helix nature C-terminal to the Ser mutation site. Thus, the T1′-892n-G10S molecule appears to be partially folded, with a rigid triple helix only N-terminal to the mutation site (Fig. 4, d–f). An understanding of triple-helix folding is important for collagen diseases, in which abnormal folding has been observed as a result of Gly substitution mutations (8Culbert A.A. Lowe M.P. Atkinson M. Byers P.H. Wallis G.A. Kadler K.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The observation of overmodification of Lys residues at sequences N-terminal to mutation sites reflects the C to N directionality of type I collagen folding and a folding delay at the mutation site. To further investigate triple-helix folding, peptides were designed with strong nucleating triple-helix sequences at the N or C terminus. Both T1-892c and T1′-892n form stable triple helices and have the same stability regardless of whether the GPO is on the N or C terminus. This suggests that the stability of peptide models can be attributed to independent contributions of the tripeptide units in the sequence. Even though both peptides form well folded triple helices with the same stability, T1-892c folds in a C to N direction, whereas T1′-892n does not show any preference in folding direction. An initial hypothesis would have been that the location of the nucleation site determines directionality; that is, if (GPO)4 is at the C terminus, there is C to N zipper-like folding, whereas if (GPO)4 is at the N terminus, there would be N- to C-terminal zipper-like folding. The studies reported here show this hypothesis is not true for the T1-892 model peptide system. This suggests that there is some inherent asymmetry in the triple helix that promotes directional folding only in the C- to N-terminal direction and only when the strong nucleation sequence is at the C terminus. In the absence of a strong C-terminal nucleation site, triple-helix formation follows a different mechanism with no clear directionality. This non-directional folding mechanism still can lead to a triple helix, but the overall folding appears to be slower. The use of triple-helix (Gly-Pro-Hyp)4 nucleating domains complements recent reports (18Frank S. Boudko S. Mizuno K. Schulthess T. Engel J. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7747-7750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Barth D. Kyrieleis O. Frank S. Renner C. Moroder L.

Disulfide bonds or foldons at either the C or N terminus can act as nucleation sites for model collagen peptides (18Frank S. Boudko S. Mizuno K. Schulthess T. Engel J. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol.

Chemistry. 2003; 9: 3703-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Coiled coil domains at either end have been shown to promote trimerization and folding and are widely used in the assembly of collagen (21McAlinger A. Smith T.A. Sandell L.J. Ficheux D. Parry D.A.D. Hulmes D.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42200-42207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of non-collagenous nucleation domains at either end of a triple helix in collagens can support triple-helix formation, although the nature of the folding when there is N-terminal nucleation has not been characterized. There is evidence that the triple-helix sequence plays a critical role in folding initiation as well (22Snellman A. Vaisanen T. Kvist A.P. Huhtala P. Pihlajaniemi T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5051-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Areida S.K. Reinhardt D.P. Muller P.K. Fietzek P.P. Kowitz J. Marinkovich M.P. Notbohm H. J. Biol.

The unique (GPO)5 sequence at the C terminus of the type I collagen triple helix and the required GPO triplets at the C terminus of type III collagen are two examples. Whereas a non-triple helical nucleation domain, such as a coiled coil or disulfide bond, models an external initiation event, the use of a (Gly-X-Y)n nucleating sequence raises the possibility of internal nucleation events in the collagen sequence. Because previous peptide studies (16Liu X. Kim S. Dai Q.-H. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1998; 33: 15528-15533Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) indicate that the C- to N-terminal propagation stops at a Gly to X mutation, with triple-helix structure only C-terminal to the mutation site, it has been suggested that renucleation may be required N-terminal to a Gly to X mutation site in order for full-length collagen to form. The ability of peptide T1′-892n′-G10S to form a N-terminal rigid triple helix presents a plausible model for independent formation of a triple helix N-terminal to a mutation site (Fig. 4, c and f). The C-terminal (Gly-Pro-Hyp)n sequence is likely to serve as the primary nucleation site, initiating the C- to N-terminal folding, but following the termination of propagation at a mutation site, independent nucleation events N-terminal to the mutation site may be facilitated at Hyp-rich sequences farther downstream in the collagen sequence to complete triple-helix formation (8Culbert A.A.

We have recently reported that the S3-S4 linker (i.e. residues 229EKGMDSEVY237 of HCN1) prominently influences the activation phenotypes of HCN channels and that part of the linker may conform a secondary helical structure. Here we further dissected the structural and functional roles of this linker by systematic alterations of its length. In contrast to voltage-gated K+ channels, complete deletion of the S3-S4 linker (Δ229–237) did not produce functional channels. Similarly, the deletions Δ229–234, Δ232–234, and Δ232–237 also abolished normal current activity. Interestingly, Δ229–231, Δ233–237, Δ234–237, Δ235–237, Δ229–231/Δ233–237, Δ229–231/Δ234–237, and Δ229–231/Δ235–237 all yielded robust hyperpolarization-activated inward currents, indicating that loss-of-function caused by deletion could be rescued by keeping the single functionally important residue Met232 alone. Whereas shortening the linker by deletion generally shifted steady-state activation in the depolarizing direction (e.g. ΔV½ of Δ229–231, Δ233–237, Δ235–237 >+10 mV relative to wild type), linker prolongation by duplicating the entire linker (Dup229–237) or by glutamine insertion (InsQ233Q, InsQQ233QQ and InsQQQ233QQQ, or Ins237QQQ) produced length-dependent progressive hyperpolarizing activation shifts (–35 mV < ΔV½ < –4 mV). Based on these results, we conclude that only Met232 is prerequisite for channels to function, but the length and other constituents of the S3-S4 linker shape the ultimate activation phenotype. Our results also highlight several evolutionary similarities and differences between HCN and voltage-gated K+ channels. Manipulations of the S3-S4 linker length may provide a flexible approach to customize HCN gating for engineering electrically active cells (such as stem cell-derived neuronal and cardiac pacemakers) for gene- and cell-based therapies."

Here we examine the role of histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling in RA-mediated repression. RA pretreatment of latently infected U1 promonocytes inhibits HIV-1 expression in response to the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). TSA is thought to activate HIV-1 transcription by inducing histone hyperacetylation within a regulatory nucleosome, nuc-1, positioned immediately downstream from the transcription start site. Acetylation of nuc-1 is thought to be a critical step in activation that precedes nuc-1 remodeling and, subsequently, transcriptional initiation. Here we demonstrate that TSA treatment induces H3 and H4 hyperacetylation and nuc-1 remodeling. Although RA pretreatment inhibits nuc-1 remodeling and HIV-1 transcription, it has no effect on histone acetylation. This suggests that acetylation and remodeling are not obligatorily coupled. We also show that growth of U1 cells in retinoid-deficient medium induces nuc-1 remodeling and HIV-1 expression but does not induce histone hyperacetylation. These findings suggest that remodeling, not histone hyperacetylation, is the limiting step in transcriptional activation in these cells.

These metabolites, including all-trans retinoic acid (RA) 1The abbreviations used are: RA, retinoic acid; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; LTR, long terminal repeat; TPA, tetradecanoylphorbol acetate; FBS, fetal bovine serum; LM-PCR, ligation-mediated PCR; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; TSA, trichostatin A; HDAC, histone deacetylase. and 9-cis retinoic acid, are potent modulators of gene transcription that bind to and activate nuclear receptor transcription factors (2Stunnenberg H.G. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Two families of retinoid-dependent transcription factors have been identified: the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs). These nuclear receptors bind to specific DNA sequences, retinoic acid response elements, as either heterodimers (RAR/RXR) or homodimers (RXR/RXR) to function as transcriptional activators or repressors. When bound by ligand, these receptors associate with co-activator complexes to activate transcription (3Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Glass C.K.

AIDS. 1994; 8: 1675-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), have also shown that retinoids can modulate HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-directed expression in cultured myeloid cells. Importantly, we recently reported (21Hanley T.M. Kiefer H.L. Schnitzler A.C. Marcello J.E. Viglianti G.A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Brown X.Q. Hanley T.M. Viglianti G.A. AIDS Res. Human Retrovir. 2002; 18: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that physiological concentrations of RA consistently repress HIV-1 replication in primary monocyte-derived macrophages grown in the presence of concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 that are expected in vivo, during HIV-1 infection. Based on these results, we hypothesized that retinoids are natural repressors of HIV-1 transcription. However, their mechanism of action is not fully understood. Three lines of evidence indicate that retinoids induce the expression of a cellular factor(s) that restricts HIV-1 transcription in monocyte/macrophages: first, repression is blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors; second, HIV-1 expression is activated when latently infected U1 cells are grown in a synthetic, retinoid-free medium; and, third, a synthetic antagonist of RAR-mediated transcriptional transactivation strongly activates HIV-1 expression in U1 cells (21Hanley T.M. Kiefer H.L. Schnitzler A.C. Marcello J.E. Viglianti G.A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Importantly, protein-DNA cross-linking experiments demonstrated that RA induces the binding of four cellular factors to nucleotides –51 through +12 of the core promoter, which includes the cis-acting sequences required for RA-mediated repression (23Maciaszek J.W. Coniglio S.J. Talmage D.A. Viglianti G.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5862-5869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During HIV-1 infection, the provirus is integrated into cellular genomic DNA and packaged into chromatin. Verdin et al. (28Verdin E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6790-6799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) have shown that the 5′-LTR is bound by two positioned nucleosomes, with a third positioned nucleosome located downstream. Nucleosome 0 (nuc-0) is located between nucleotides –415 and –255 (where +1 is the start site of transcription); nuc-1 is located between nucleotides +10 and +155; and nuc-2 is located between nucleotides +265 and +412 (29Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Nuc-1 is thought to play a role in the restriction of HIV-1 transcription in latently infected cells (29Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 30Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2535-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is thought that nuc-1 must be remodeled prior to transcription. This idea is supported by the findings that nuc-1 remodeling occurs rapidly in response to activators including TNF-α and tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) and is insensitive to the transcription inhibitor, α-amanitin (29Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 30Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). A number of studies have provided evidence that histone and/or transcription factor acetylation is involved in chromatin remodeling and the subsequent activation of HIV-1 transcription. In general, histone acetylation is correlated with transcriptional activation and is thought to both modify chromatin structure to allow greater access of the transcription machinery to promoters, and to provide binding sites for bromodomain-containing regulatory factors that recognize acetylated lysine residues (reviewed in Ref. 32Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 76: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Van Lint et al. (30Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) first showed that histone deacetylase inhibitors induce chromatin remodeling and transcription from the HIV-1 promoter in latently infected cells. In agreement, studies of transcription from the HIV-1 promoter using in vitro reconstituted nucleosomal templates demonstrated that acetylation of either histones or another regulatory transcription factor plays a critical role in transcriptional activation (33Sheridan P.L. Mayall T.P. Verdin E. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3327-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). More recently, Lusic et al. (34Lusic M. Marcello A. Cereseto A. Giacca M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6550-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) reported that the histone acetyltransferases (HATs), CBP, hGCN5, and P/CAF are recruited to the LTR following activation by TPA and/or Tat, and this recruitment is associated with the acetylation of histones H3 and H4. We recently reported that pretreatment of latently infected U1 cells with RA prevents activation of HIV-1 transcription by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (21Hanley T.M. Kiefer H.L. Schnitzler A.C. Marcello J.E. Viglianti G.A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we show that TSA-mediated activation of HIV-1 transcription is associated with an increase in nuc-1 remodeling and the hyperacetylation of nuc-1 associated histones H3 and H4. RA pretreatment inhibits nuc-1 remodeling but has no effect on histone acetylation. Moreover, although activation of HIV-1 expression by retinoid depletion is associated with nuc-1 remodeling, there is no concomitant increase in histone acetylation above non-activated baseline levels. This suggests that remodeling, not histone hyperacetylation, is the limiting step in transcriptional activation in these cells. Together, these data indicate that retinoid signaling is required to maintain HIV-1 latency in monocyte/macrophages and acts by preventing nuc-1 remodeling at a step in transcriptional activation downstream from histone acetylation.

Ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR)—Purified nuclei were resuspended at 108 nuclei/ml in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2 and 0.3 m sucrose and digested with the indicated concentrations of micrococcal nuclease for 20 min at 37 °C. DNA was purified and treated with T4 polynucleotide kinase to phosphorylate the 5′-ends (36Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). LM-PCR was carried out as described previously (37Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) using primers specific for the HIV-1 5′-LTR (29Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). First strand synthesis was performed with primer A (5′-CTCCGCTAGTCAAAATTTTTGG-3′). Subsequent double-stranded products were ligated with a linker formed by annealing primers LP1 (5′-GTATCGATCTGGAGATCTGAATTC-3′) and LP2 (GAATTCAGATC-3′). PCR amplification was performed with primers LP1 and B (5′-ATTTTTGGCGTACTCACCAGTC-3′) for 18–22 cycles. Amplification products were then labeled for 2 cycles with 32P-labeled primer C (5′-TACTCACCAGTCGCCGCCCCTCGCCTCTTG-3′). Labeled products were separated on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Immunoprecipitations for acetyl H3- or acetyl H4-containing chromatin were performed using a commercial kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Immunoprecipitations for non-acetylated H4-containing chromatin were performed using an antibody against nonacetylated H4 N-terminal tails (Serotec). Cellular lysates were sonicated using a cup horn (550 Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher Scientific) either at a power setting of 5, with 25 30-s pulses on ice (this fragmented the chromatin to an average length of 150–350 bp; protocol A) or at a power setting of 3, with four 10-s pulses on ice (this fragmented the chromatin to an average length of 500–1200 bp; protocol B). Purified DNA samples from both ChIPs and controls were resuspended in distilled H2O and analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR. PCR reactions contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 pmol of each primer, 200 μm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, 5μCi α32P-dATP, and 1.25 units of Amplitaq (Applied Biosystems) for nuc-1 and gag primers or 2.5 units of Amplitaq Gold for nuc-0 primers in 50-μl total reaction volume. Following an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 15 min, DNAs were amplified for 30 cycles, each consisting of a 30-s denaturing step at 94 °C, a 45-s annealing step at 65 °C, and a 1-min extension step at 72 °C. Samples were electrophoresed on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified using a PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics). Control amplifications of a serial dilution of purified U1 genomic DNA were performed with each primer set to ensure that all amplifications were within the linear range of the reaction. To calculate the relative acetylation levels, PhosphorImager data of the amounts of PCR product obtained for immunoprecipitated chromatin samples were normalized against the amounts of PCR product obtained for input DNA. All values represent the average of at least three independent experiments. All-trans Retinoic Acid Prevents the Remodeling of a Regulatory Nucleosome Positioned at the Start Site of HIV-1 Transcription—We recently reported that pretreatment of latently infected U1 cells with RA prevents TSA-mediated activation of HIV-1 transcription (21Hanley T.M. Kiefer H.L. Schnitzler A.C. Marcello J.E. Viglianti G.A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because TSA is thought to activate HIV-1 expression by inducing histone hyperacetylation and chromatin remodeling of the LTR (30Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining whether RA pretreatment would also repress these steps in transcriptional activation. In agreement with our previous studies, we found that HIV-1 expression in U1 cells was induced 11-fold by TSA, and that RA pretreatment for 48 h prevented this activation (Fig. 1A). We next determined whether RA pretreatment affected the accessibility of the HIV-1 LTR to restriction enzymes that have recognition sites within or between the known positioned nucleosomes of the LTR (29Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Nuclei were prepared from U1 cells and digested with EcoRV, ScaI, AflII, or Hinf I. DNA was purified from the nuclei and digested to completion with PstI, which has a recognition site downstream of nuc-2 at position +960 (30Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The digested products were then analyzed by Southern blot, using a 32P-labeled probe encompassing nucleotides +188 to +960 (29Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). We found that the ScaI and Hinf I sites within the internucleosomal regions between either nuc-0 and nuc-1 or nuc-1 and nuc-2 were accessible in nuclei from untreated cells (Fig. 1, C and D). The accessibility of these sites was not affected by a 3-h TSA treatment. However, in agreement with previous reports (30Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Ott M. Verdin E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), TSA increased the accessibility of nuc-1 DNA to both AflII and Hinf I. Pretreatment of the cells with RA for 48 h prior to TSA treatment not only decreased the accessibility of nuc-1 DNA to AflII or Hinf I in nuclei from untreated cells, but also inhibited by ∼2.5-fold the increase in accessibility induced by TSA (Fig. 1, C and D). This RA-mediated decrease in accessibility appears to be specific for nuc-1. RA pretreatment did not inhibit restriction enzyme accessibility to internucleosomal regions or to nuc-0 DNA; instead, it induced a slight increase in accessibility of these regions. To confirm that RA inhibits nuc-1 remodeling, we examined this region using ligation-mediated PCR amplification of DNA purified from micrococcal nuclease digested nuclei (29Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). Micrococcal nuclease preferentially cleaves DNA in internucleosomal regions and can therefore be used to map the location of positioned nucleosomes. We found that TSA treatment increased accessibility of the LTR to micrococcal nuclease in a region located immediately downstream from the transcription start site. This region corresponds to the previously reported position of nuc-1 (29Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Importantly, TSA treatment did not affect accessibility of the sequences flanking nuc-1. In agreement with our restriction enzyme accessibility studies, RA pretreatment inhibited the TSA-induced increase in nuc-1 DNA accessibility. Together, these results indicate that RA signaling prevents remodeling of nuc-1. We initially examined the effects of RA pretreatment on nuc-1 remodeling 3 h after TSA treatment. However, it is possible that TSA might induce a transient increase in nuc-1 remodeling in RA-treated cells that was missed in our analysis. We therefore examined the accessibility of nuc-1 DNA to Hinf I over a 24-h period after TSA treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). Increased accessibility was detected within 10 min after TSA treatment and was greatest between 2 and 3 h after treatment. Between 18 and 24 h, accessibility began to decrease, suggesting that a nucleosome structure similar to that observed in non-activated cells was reestablished for the LTR. Importantly, RA pretreatment of the cells inhibited the TSA-induced remodeling of nuc-1 at all time points examined (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that the repressive effects of RA are robust and long lasting. We also measured HIV-1 mRNA expression and p24 release at various times after TSA treatment. HIV-1 mRNA was not detected until ∼2 h after TSA treatment indicating that there is a lag between nuc-1 remodeling and transcriptional activation of the LTR (Fig. 2B). A lag was also seen between HIV-1 transcription and virion release from the infected cells; p24 was not detected in the supernatant until 12 h after TSA treatment. As expected, RA pretreatment of the cells strongly inhibited HIV-1 mRNA accumulation and p24 release at all time points examined. These findings are consistent with the hypotheses that nuc-1 remodeling is a limiting step in HIV-1 transcriptional activation and that RA signaling maintains HIV-1 latency in U1 cells by preventing remodeling. All trans-RA Does Not Affect TSA-induced H3 or H4 Acetylation at nuc-1—Our findings that RA inhibited TSA-induced nuc-1 remodeling and HIV-1 transcriptional activation raised the possibility that RA may prevent histone acetylation within nuc-1. We used a ChIP assay to examine the levels of H3 and H4 acetylation. The antibodies used in these experiments recognize either acetylated histone H3 (lysines 9 and 14) or acetylated histone H4 (lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16). The PCR primers and the sizes of chromatin DNA generated for our ChIP experiments are shown in Table I and Fig. 3.Table IDNA sequences and nucleotide positions of PCR primers used in ChIP analysesPrimerPositionPrimer sequence (5′-3′)nuc0(s)-427 to -405GACAAGAGATCCTTGATCTGTGGnuc0(as)-198 to -175GCTAGGAGGCTGTCAAACTTCCACnuc1A(s)-50 to -30TGGCGAGCCCTCAGATGCTACnuc1B(s)+10 to +32GTTAGACCAGATCTGAGCCTGGGnuc1(as)+172 to +192GTTCGGGCGCCACTGCTAGAGgag(s)+998 to +1020CCTATTGCACCAGGCCAGATGAGgag(as)+1375 to +1395CCCACTCCCTGACATGCTGTC Open table in a new tab In order to look specifically at nuc-1, we developed a sonication protocol (protocol A) to generate chromatin fragments that contain, on average, 150–350 bp and that are less than 500 bp (Fig. 3B). These fragments are therefore approximately the size of an average nucleosome including linker DNA. Because nuc-1 is a positioned nucleosome that is separated from neighboring nucleosomes by about 265 bp (5′) and 110 bp (3′) (28Verdin E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6790-6799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), DNA fragments that contain nuc-1 and are less than 500 base pairs should not contain adjacent nucleosomes. To ensure that we were examining acetylation of nucleosomes bound to the 5′-LTR, we used a nuc-1 reverse primer positioned within the gag leader sequence (Table I and Fig. 3A). Using this sonication protocol, we found that TSA treatment for 20 min increased the acetylation of H3 (2.0-fold) and H4 (5.2-fold) (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, RA pretreatment, which inhibited both TSA-induced nuc-1 remodeling and HIV-1 mRNA accumulation, did not inhibit these increases in histone acetylation (Fig. 4A). To eliminate the possibility that differences in the levels of acetylated histones are masked by nucleosome displacement from the LTR, we examined the levels of non-acetylated H4 by ChIP and found no change within nuc-1 because of either TSA or RA (Fig. 4B). Together, these data suggest that RA does not repress transcription by preventing histone acetylation at nuc-1. Although RA signaling had no effect on histone acetylation within nuc-1, it was possible that it might affect other nucleosomes within the 5′-LTR. To address this question, we used a sonication protocol (protocol B) that generates chromatin fragments between 500 and 1200 bp (Fig. 3B). Fragments in this size range can contain more than one nucleosome and therefore allowed us to examine changes in histone acetylation over a larger region of the LTR. Using this sonication protocol, we found that a 20-min TSA treatment increased the acetylation of both H3 (3.3-fold) and H4 (11.5-fold) within nuc-1 (Fig. 4C; nuc-1 primers). As with our ChIP analysis specific for nuc-1, RA pretreatment did not prevent TSA-induced H3 and H4 acetylation within the 5′-LTR (Fig. 4C; nuc-1 primers). We also found that the levels of TSA-induced acetylation within this broa"

The x-ray structure of the enzyme revealed an important structural difference between this protein and other aldehyde dehydrogenases of the same enzyme superfamily; a 20-amino acid span in the substrate access channel in retinaldehyde dehydrogenase II is disordered, whereas in other aldehyde dehydrogenases this region forms a well defined wall of the substrate access channel. We asked whether this disordered loop might order during the course of catalysis and provide a means for an enzyme that requires a large substrate access channel to restrict access to the catalytic machinery by smaller compounds that might potentially enter the active site and be metabolized.

Our experiments, a combination of kinetic, spectroscopic, and crystallographic techniques, suggest that a disorder to order transition is linked to catalytic activity. In the developing embryo the generation of retinoic acid by metabolism of the inactive precursor retinol must be finely regulated. The consequences of deregulation of this process are tragic; the teratogenic effects of retinoic acid analogs used to treat cystic acne are thought to be a result of aberrant retinoic acid concentrations during morphogenesis (1McCaffery P.J. Adams J. Maden M. Rosa-Molinar E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 457-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In their studies of the developing spinal cord, McCaffery and Drager (2McCaffery P. Drager U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7194-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) observed retinal dehydrogenase activity with the same spatiotemporal distribution as that of retinoic acid and subsequently identified the enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type II (RalDH2) 1The abbreviations used are: RalDH2, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type II; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: RalDH2, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type II; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase. in their examination of the effect of retinoic acid signaling in the formation of the neural axis (3Zhao D. McCaffery P. Ivins K.J. Neve R.L. Hogan P. Chin W.W. Drager U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Similar studies suggested a role for RalDH2 in the developing mammalian heart (4Moss J.B. Xavier-Neto J. Shapiro M.D. Nayeem S.M. McCaffery P. Drager U.C. Rosenthal N. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The validity of the hypothesis that RalDH2 produces retinoic acid in the developing embryo was confirmed by the transgenic knock-out mice results of Chambon and co-workers (5Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dolle P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). RalDH2-/- embryos exhibit the spectrum of defects associated with developmental processes previously shown to be retinoic acid-dependent and die at mid-gestation. Near full rescue is observed when retinoic acid is administered to the mothers (5Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dolle P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). These results provide a striking contrast to those of similar experiments in which the different retinoic acid receptor genes were mutated in mice. Six genes code for two classes of retinoic acid receptors in the mammalian genome, and the inactivation of a single gene for a retinoic acid receptor results in only mild abnormalities in developmental phenotypes (6Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 7Mark M. Ghyselinck N.B. Wendling O. Dupe V. Mascrez B. Kastner P. Chambon P. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1999; 58: 609-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, RalDH2 activity is indispensable in morphogenesis (5Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dolle P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Prior to this work, RalDH2 was cloned by the Napoli laboratory as a result of their efforts to identify enzymes that produced retinoic acid in the testis (8Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16288-16293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Retinoic acid is abundant in the testis, and the use of that tissue avoided the complications of using liver as a source for cDNA. The liver has many more abundant aldehyde dehydrogenases, such as the phenobarbital-inducible dehydrogenases, which would complicate the identification of the retinaldehyde-specific dehydrogenase. In the adult animal RalDH2 is expressed in brain and lung as well as the testis (8Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16288-16293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). RalDH2 is a member of the NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily for which there are several structures available in addition to that of RalDH2 (9Liu Z.J. Sun Y.J. Rose J. Chung Y.J.

Those structures of the enzyme from bovine mitochondria and sheep liver have the highest sequence identity with RalDH2 (66 and 73% identity, respectively). A structure for the highly homologous lens protein η-crystallin (70% identity) has been described recently (14Bateman O.A. Purkiss A.G. van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Graham C. Wistow G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4349-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as well. Aldehyde dehydrogenases utilize a conserved Cys (Cys-302 in the bovine mitochondrial enzyme) in the oxidation of aldehyde to carboxylic acid with the concomitant reduction of NAD to NADH. RalDH2 is able to process retinal free or as it is found in the cell bound to its carrier protein cellular retinol/retinal binding protein (8Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16288-16293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Many aldehyde dehydrogenases are classed as detoxification enzymes as the enzymes selectively eliminate aldehydes generated in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. However, the knock-out experiments described above clearly demonstrate that RalDH2 is the source of retinoic acid required for normal development and consequently indicate a pivotal role for the enzyme in the production of the transcriptional regulator retinoic acid. The structures of aldehyde dehydrogenases involved in the metabolism of acetaldehyde have a long (∼18Å) substrate access channel into which acetaldehyde can readily diffuse. However, retinal dehydrogenase differs in that it has a disordered loop within the substrate access channel, and it was suggested that it is precisely this disorder (13Lamb A.L. Newcomer M.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that is key to the fact that substrate preference of RalDH2 is for long aliphatic aldehydes (8Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16288-16293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A substrate-induced disorder to order transition was proposed to mediate substrate recognition. Hurley et al. (15Hurley T.D. Perez-Miller S. Breen H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; (3-14): 130-132Google Scholar) subsequently reported a disorder to order transition induced by the binding of the co-factor to the bovine mitochondrial ALDH2: R475Q mutant that involves the same region of that enzyme, but in RalDH2 with co-factor bound this region remains disordered as indicated by the lack of any interpretable electron density in an otherwise clear electron density map. We report here a series of experiments designed to reveal the functional basis for the lack of a well formed substrate access channel in RalDH2. We asked whether access channel disorder might provide a mechanism for the enzyme, which requires a large substrate binding channel for its 20-carbon biological substrate, to restrict access to catalytic machinery by smaller aldehydes. This mechanism could be a result of the linking of a disorder to order transition to catalytic activity. We reasoned that regions of a protein that are disordered and do not participate directly in catalysis or substrate binding are insensitive to amino acid substitutions. If we introduce mutations into a region of the disordered loop and observe a reduced catalytic activity that cannot be explained by a loss in substrate binding affinity, then we can infer that the segment of the polypeptide in which the mutation was made makes a specific intramolecular interaction during the catalytic cycle, i.e. a disorder to order transition occurs. This is precisely what we observe; mutation of the disordered segment results in a reduced apparent Vmax for the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by RalDH2. Fluorescence data support our interpretation of the experimental results. In the region of the disordered loop there are two Trp residues (Trp-176 and Trp-451). If the loop adopts a conformation similar to the corresponding region of the homologous aldehyde dehydrogenases, these tryptophans would be shielded from solvent. An additional Trp (Trp-167) packs against the ribose ring in the NADH binding site. We observed a reduced fluorescence resonance energy transfer between Trp and NADH that accompanies catalysis in RalDH2 in which amino acids substitutions are introduced in the disordered loop region. Such an observation would be expected if the loop mutant were incapable of ordering in the access channel and shielding Trp-176 and Trp-451 from solvent, or if the position or environment of the nicotinamide ring were affected. Steady state kinetic data indicate that the affinity for a series of model substrates is not significantly affected by the amino acids substitutions. In contrast, the Km for the co-factor NAD is appreciably higher in the mutant enzyme despite the fact that the substitution was made in the access channel and removed from amino acids that directly interact with co-factor. These observations suggest non-local structural consequences of the mutation, consistent with a disorder to order transition. In addition, we determined the crystal structure of the mutant enzyme in the presence of NAD and absence of substrate and show that it is essentially unchanged from the native structure; the “disordered loop” of the access channel is disordered in the presence of NAD and absence of substrate just as it is in the wild-type enzyme. Thus an inadvertent ordering of the loop can be ruled out. Bacterial Strains and Media—The expression strain E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS from Novagen was used to overexpress all RalDH2 constructs. For all growths and protein overexpression, LB (10.0 g of casein, 5.0 g of yeast extract, and 10.0 g of NaCl, pH 7.0) was used. Novablue (Novagen) and XL1-Blue (Stratagene) cells were used for the cloning and propagation of all plasmid constructs. The antibiotics ampicillin and chloramphenicol were used at final concentrations of 50 and 34 μg/ml, respectively, when used in either broth or 1.5% agar plates. Construction of an Expression Plasmid for Non-histidine-tagged Wild-type RalDH2—The gene for mouse RalDH2 maintained in the Invitrogen cloning vector pCDNA3 was a gift from Dr. J. L. Napoli. PCR was performed to amplify the entire RalDH2 gene from plasmid pCDNA3. PCR product was cloned into plasmid pSTBlue1 using the Perfectly Blunt cloning kit (Novagen). The RalDH2 gene was subsequently excised via an NdeI/BamHI digestion and ligated into the Novagen pET3a vector to yield the RalDH2 expression plasmid pT-BRD2, in which RalDH2 gene expression is regulated by the T7 promoter. Plasmid pTBRD2 was sequenced to ensure that no point mutations were introduced during PCR. Mouse RalDH2 has a single amino acid change from rat (I352V, mouse → rat), the source of the clone for our previous structure determination. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The RalDH2 double mutant L459F/N460G and catalytic mutant C301A were constructed via the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using plasmid pTBRD2 as the template. The resulting plasmids, pTBRD2FG and pTBC301A, were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations within the RalDH2 gene and to confirm that no extraneous mutations had been introduced through PCR. Expression and Purification of Mouse RalDH2—For expression of the RalDH2 constructs, plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS. An overnight culture was grown to saturation followed by a 100-fold dilution into 1 liter of LB containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. The culture was grown at 37 °C with continuous shaking (220 rpm) until the A600 reached 0.8 and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to induce RalDH2 expression. The culture was then grown for an additional 1 h after induction under the same conditions followed by an additional 48 h of incubation carried out at room temperature with constant agitation (220 rpm). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and were subsequently resuspended in low salt buffer (25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.4) at a concentration of 35 ml per 1 liter of bacterial culture and then frozen at –80 °C. Cells were lysed with three cycles of freezing and thawing of the cell suspension. DNase and MgCl2 were added at a final concentration of 40 Kunitz units and 5 mm, respectively, per 35 ml of cell suspension to degrade chromosomal DNA. Protease inhibitors pepstatin and leupeptin were also added to the lysate to help prevent proteolytic cleavage of RalDH2. The crude lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. All further protein purification steps were conducted at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and diluted 2-fold with low salt buffer and then applied to a column containing 70 ml of Affi-Gel Blue Gel in which RalDH2 was able to bind to the column via its nucleotide binding domain. The column was thoroughly washed with a NaCl step gradient (25 mm, 500 mm, and 1 m NaCl) using 3 column volumes of low salt buffer supplemented with the corresponding amounts of NaCl. RalDH2 was then eluted with 2 column volumes of low salt buffer containing 2 mm NAD. The eluant was concentrated to 5–7 ml using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices. Glycerol was added to the concentrated protein to a final concentration of 10%, and the sample was applied to an S300 Sephacryl sizing column. Further purification was achieved by anion exchange chromatography on a 7.5-ml DEAE cellulose column eluted with a NaCl gradient. Purified enzyme was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and analyzed by SDS-PAGE for protein purity before dropwise flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at –80 °C. Crystallization—Crystals were grown in hanging drop vapor diffusion experiments. Drops were 2 μl of RalDH2:L458F/N459G (7.6 mg/ml) in the presence of excess NAD (2 mm) and retinol (at 1.8 times the concentration of enzyme) plus an equal volume of well solution (7% PEG 6000, 2% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5). The crystals belong to space group P21 and have unit cell dimensions of a = 83.32 Å, b = 142.03 Å, c = 85.00 Å, β = 93.88°. There is one tetramer in the asymmetric unit. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Crystals of the RalDH2 loop mutant were transferred directly to mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol and frozen in the stream of an Oxford Cryojet. X-ray data were collected with a Mar345 image plate scanner mounted on a Nonius FR591 generator fitted with Osmic mirrors. A total of 177 frames of 1° oscillations were collected to give a 3.3 Å resolution data set with a final Rmerge of 14.0%. The data set is 95.3% complete (72% in the highest shell) with 3.2-fold redundancy. At this resolution the overall I/σ was 9.5 (1.8 in the highest resolution shell). The structure was solved by the method of molecular replacement. A tetramer of the native structure of rat RalDH2 served as a search model (13Lamb A.L. Newcomer M.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The resulting 3.3 Å resolution structure was refined with 4-fold non-crystallographic symmetry constraints to a Rwork (Rfree) of 0.229 (0.304) with no σ cutoff applied to the reflections. The model includes 14,571 protein atoms, 108 co-factor atoms (only the adenine diphosphate is positioned), and 39 water molecules. Average protein, co-factor, and water B-factors are 61, 45, and 65 Å2, respectively. Diffraction data were processed with Denzo and Scalepack (16Otwinoswki Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). All other crystallo-graphic calculations were performed with CNS (17Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Maps were interpreted with the program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12997) Google Scholar). Kinetic Measurements—Enzyme assays for the determination of the Km values of the substrates were conducted over at least six substrate concentrations (4 to 250 μm for hexanal, octanal, and decanal and 1 mm to 128 mm for acetaldehyde) in an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow reaction analyzer by monitoring NADH fluorescence (excitation wavelength 340 nm, emission cutoff filter 420 nm) with a 0.2-cm path length. These experiments were performed at 25 °C. Enzyme activity was quantitated for each set of experiments by monitoring the absorbance of NADH at 340 nm in the stopped-flow. Measurements were performed at either 230 or 460 nm enzyme in the presence of 1 to 4 mm NAD, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. These concentrations are those in the observation cell. Each experimental trace in fluorescence mode is the average of three consecutive observations. For absorbance mode data, at least eight traces were averaged. The activity of the dual mutant enzyme for retinal was compared with that of the wild-type enzyme by monitoring fluorescence changes under identical assay conditions. When retinal (which absorbs at 340 nm) is the substrate, care is taken to avoid quenching of the fluorescence by performing the measurements at concentrations of retinal with an absorbance of less than 0.1. We found that the mutant had 34% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme under identical assay conditions, but given the spectral properties of retinal we were unable to determine whether the apparent reduction in the rate of retinal oxidation could not be overcome at higher substrate concentrations as the absorbance properties of retinal and retinoic acid interfered with our assay at higher substrate concentrations. The data for the NAD Km determinations were obtained by monitoring the absorbance of NADH with an Agilent diode array spectrophotometer with octanal (50 μm) as the substrate. Data were obtained for six concentrations (in triplicate, 0.125–4 mm NAD for the mutant). Data Analysis—Values for Km and Vmax were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of a plot of velocity versus substrate (or NAD) concentration data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. For the acetaldehyde data with the mutant enzyme the data fit best to equation (1), where V1 and V2 are maximal velocities, Km1 and Km2 are Michaelis constants, and A is the concentration of substrate. v=V1A/(Km1+A)+V2A(Km2+A) (Eq. 1) Fluorescence Spectra—Fluorescence emission spectra of protein-bound (in the absence of substrate or product) and free NADH were recorded at excitation wavelengths of 295 nm and 340 nm in a Jasco FP-6300 fluorimeter. For these spectra, enzyme was incubated with an excess of NADH and desalted with Sephadex G-25 prior to the measurements. Fluorescence Changes in the Pre-steady State Regime—The change in florescence that occurs upon mixing of substrate and enzyme as above was monitored by excitation at 295 nm in an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow reaction analyzer. The cutoff filter used for these measurements was 420 nm. The observed NADH fluorescence has two components: fluorescence that is caused by absorbance by NADH at 295 nm, and that emission that occurs as a result of energy transfer from the excited Trp residues within the Förster distance of NADH. Experiments were performed with a catalytically inactive mutant (RalDH2:C301A) as well as the native and loop mutant proteins. No signal is observed for the catalytically inactive mutant. Because this enzyme is incapable of producing NADH, the lack of a signal is consistent with our interpretation that the fluorescence observed is that of NADH, which results from either resonance energy transfer from Trp or from NADH absorbance at 295 nm. These experiments were performed with 460 nm enzyme, 4 mm NAD, 250 μm octanal in the observation cell. The structure of RalDH2 was determined previously in the presence of NAD and the absence of substrate or substrate analog. Amino acids ∼457–477 were not visible in the electron density maps (13Lamb A.L. Newcomer M.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and unlike their counterparts in the previous ALDH structures, which were also determined in the presence of co-factor but absence of substrate (9Liu Z.J.

Interact. 2001; (3-14): 130-132Google Scholar) were disordered. (Alternatively, these regions may have more than one possible conformation, and these conformations could be randomly distributed in the tetramer of the asymmetric unit.) In contrast to what is observed for ALDH2 and ALDH3, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type II shows preference for aldehydes with long hydrocarbon chains in vitro and does not efficiently oxidize acetaldehyde (8Wang X. Penzes P. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16288-16293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These data led us to propose a model for how disorder in this region might determine substrate specificity; the disordered loop provides a mechanism to link substrate binding to catalysis. We reasoned that the binding of a large hydrophobic substrate such as retinal induces a conformational change that orders the loop and enables catalysis. Smaller aldehydes are unable to promote this conformational change because they lack sufficient surface for productive interaction. Implicit in this model is the idea that the channel must order (no matter what the substrate) for optimal catalytic activity. To test this theory we chose to introduce two mutations in the mobile loop: residues Leu-458 and Asn-459 were replaced by a Phe and Gly, respectively, their counterparts in the highly homologous bovine mitochondrial dehydrogenase (10Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Studies with this enzyme by others have provided an enormous amount of mechanistic information that we can utilize to guide our interpretation of data obtained for RalDH2 (10Steinmetz C.G. Xie P.

The mutated amino acids (458–459) are located at the amino-terminal end of the disordered loop region and in the homologous structures form a surface at the base of the substrate access channel. The catalytic Cys (Cys-301 in RalDH2) is between the wall of the access channel that Phe-459 provides and the NAD binding site. The three-dimensional context of the mutation is highly conserved between RalDH2 and ALDH2, and in the latter enzyme the corresponding Phe participates in an aromatic cluster with amino acids found in RalDH2 as well (Trp-177 and Phe-465; ALDH2 numbering). Multiple reasons are behind the choice of this dual substitution (1McCaffery P.J. Adams J. Maden M. Rosa-Molinar E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 457-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This sequence difference between RalDH2 and ALDH2 (LN versus FG) could conceivably be one of the reasons that the channel is disordered in the former but ordered in the latter enzyme. Both Phe and Gly could contribute to stabilization of the loop in ALDH2 as Phe participates in the aromatic cluster referred to above, and Gly appears to be required for its lack of a side chain. In such a case the introduction of the substitutions might order the channel, and this result would allow us to determine the consequence of a “permanent” ordering (versus “permanent” disordering) of the loop on catalysis (2McCaffery P. Drager U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7194-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It is important to emphasize here that the disordered loop is not fully surfaced-exposed but confined in the volume of the access channel. Thus in its disordered state, the loop region may represent a mobile barrier that smaller substrates must circumnavigate to reach the catalytic cysteine. A dual substitution was required to ensure no net gain in the volume of amino acids that must be accommodated in the channel (3Zhao D. McCaffery P. Ivins K.J. Neve R.L. Hogan P. Chin W.W. Drager U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The mutated positions are removed in sequence from Ser-470, an invariant amino acid (Ser-471 in ALDH2 numbering) that has been shown to be important in this superfamily of enzymes. A substitution of an immediate neighbor of this amino acid could conceivably interfere directly with enzyme activity. In Fig 1a, the structure of ALDH2 with NADH bound as reported by Perez-Miller and Hurley (27Perez-Miller S.J. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) is provided to illustrate the above points. Amino acids that are identical in the two enzymes are shown in green. Confirmation That Native-like Structure Is Maintained in the Mutant Protein—To confirm that the introduction of the mutations did not result in unanticipated structural changes or inadvertently order the otherwise disordered loop, we determined the structure of the mutant enzyme to 3.3 Å resolution. Although this resolution is modest, it is sufficient to confirm that the structure of the L458F/N459G mutant is indeed native-like and that the loop comprised of amino acids 457–477 remains disordered in the enzyme.

In osteoblasts C/EBPβ can increase insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) transcription following treatment with hormones that activate protein kinase A, but little is known as yet about the expression of C/EBPβ itself in these cells. We initially showed that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) rapidly enhances C/EBPβ mRNA and protein expression, and in this study we identified a 3′-proximal region of the C/EBPβ promoter containing a 541-bp upstream sequence that could account for this effect. PGE2-dependent activation of C/EBPβ was blocked by expression of a mutated regulatory subunit of protein kinase A or by mutation of two previously identified cAMP-sensitive cis-acting regulatory elements within the promoter between bp –111 and –61. Nuclear protein binding to these elements was induced by PGE2, required new protein synthesis, and was sensitive to antibody to the transcription factor termed Fos-related antigen 2 (Fra-2). Fra-2 cDNA generated from rat osteoblasts by reverse transcriptase PCR was 95% homologous to human Fra-2, and PGE2 rapidly induced Fra-2 mRNA and protein expression. Consistent with these findings, over-expression of Fra-2 significantly increased C/EBPβ promoter activity in PGE2-induced osteoblasts, whereas expression of Fra-2 lacking its activation domain had a dominant negative inhibitory effect. Together, these results reveal a significant, hormone-dependent role for Fra-2 in osteoblast function, both directly, through its ability to increase new C/EBPβ gene expression, and indirectly, through downstream C/EBP sensitive genes.

Individual C/EBPs can form homodimers or heterodimers and share common DNA binding response elements, consistent with the high degree of homology in their carboxyl termini where their dimerization and DNA binding domains reside. Of these, basal expression of C/EBPβ is high in liver, intestines, differentiating adipocytes, lung, kidney, and spleen, as well as in monocytic blood cells. However, basal expression of C/EBPβ is relatively low in osteoblasts, but it can be enhanced by treatment with glucocorticoid, PGE2, or 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 (3McCarthy T.L. Ji C. Chen Y. Kim K.

In osteoblasts either C/EBPδ or C/EBPβ, which are variably expressed in several osteoblastic cell models, can in turn activate the expression of several prominent downstream genes, including those encoding IGF-I, IGFBP-5, IL-6, osteocalcin, and cyclooxygenase 2 (4Umayahara Y.

Biochem. 2003; 88: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), is an important, direct regulator of C/EBPδ expression in osteoblasts, by way of a Runx binding sequence located between bp –165 to –159 in the C/EBPδ gene promoter (12McCarthy T.L.

Moreover, through an apparent negative feedback inhibition, the carboxyl-terminal region of C/EBPδ can bind directly to Runx2 and in this way self-limit C/EBPδ expression and activity. Others have reported roles for STAT3, Sp1, and C/EBPδ itself in the regulation of C/EBPδ expression in other cell models (13Yamada T. Tobita K. Osada S. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biochem.

By contrast, molecular mediators that direct C/EBPβ gene expression have been better established in nonskeletal tissue-derived cells. For example, studies in hepatocytes defined two cAMP-responsive elements (CREs) that are located between bp –121 and –71 in the C/EBPβ promoter and can interact with CREB and C/EBPβ to drive C/EBPβ gene expression. In those cells, lipopolysaccharide increases C/EBPβ expression through shared or distinct elements that require c-Jun and ATF-2, whereas IL-6-dependent induction of C/EBPβ involves an indirect association of STAT3 to these CRE sequences (17Niehof M. Manns M. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Niehof M. Kubicka S. Zender L. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. J. Mol.

Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 2Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In osteoblasts, we earlier reported an increase in C/EBPβ expression in response to PGE2 (3McCarthy T.L. Ji C. Chen Y. Kim K. Centrella M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have characterized the molecular mediators that can account for this effect. We demonstrate the relative importance of a specific protein kinase system and the two previously identified cis-acting CREs that drive new C/EBPβ synthesis. Finally, we show that one trans-acting transcription factor that can control this event in differentiating osteoblasts is distinct from those factors characterized previously in other cell types, predicting a novel control mechanism that may be tissue or context specific.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Primary osteoblast-enriched cultures were prepared from parietal bones of 22-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses (Charles River Breeding Laboratories) by methods approved by the Yale Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Bone sutures were dissected, and cells were released from the bone fragments by five sequential collagenase digestions. Cells pooled from the last three digestions express many biochemical features that typify differentiating osteoblasts, including high levels of nuclear factor Runx2, parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor, type I collagen synthesis, and alkaline phosphatase activity (20McCarthy T.L.

Polymerase One-step RT-PCR System (Roche Applied Science) with forward primer GAGAATTCGGGAAATGTACCAGGATTATCCCGGG and reverse primer GCTCTAGATTACAGAGCCAGCAGAGTGGGG based on rat Fra-2 sequence information in GenBank™ (accession no. NM_012954), utilizing the EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites (underlined) for directional cloning. An expression plasmid encoding dominant negative Fra-2 was produced from this construct by reverse transcriptase PCR to delete amino acids 208–328, comprising its transactivation domain.Transfections—Promoter-reporter constructs, gene expression plasmids, or empty parental vectors were pre-titrated for optimal expression efficiency and transfected with reagent TransIT LT1 (Mirus). Cells at 50–70% culture confluence (25,000–30,000/cm2) were exposed to an optimal amount of expression plasmid (10–20 ng/cm2) or reporter plasmid (50 ng/cm2) in medium supplemented with 0.8% fetal bovine serum for 16 h and then supplemented to obtain a final concentration of 5% serum. Cells were cultured for 48 h, treated as indicated in each figure in serum-free medium, rinsed, and lysed. Nuclear-free supernatants were analyzed for reporter gene activity and corrected for protein content. To account for competition among plasmids for limiting transcription components, control cells were transfected with a compensating amount of empty vector. Transfection efficiency was assessed in parallel with positive and negative reporter plasmids as described previously (28Ji C. Casinghino S. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21260-21267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted with acid-guanidine-monothiocyanate, precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, and dissolved in sterile water (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62975) Google Scholar). mRNA levels were assessed by Northern blot analysis using 10 μg of RNA denatured in formaldehyde/formamide. Co-electrophoresed RNA standards were used to verify transcript size. Restriction fragments including cDNA inserts encoding rat C/EBPβ or rat Fra-2 were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen Corp.) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dTTP by random hexanucleotide-primed second strand synthesis to use as Northern blot probes. Post-hybridization stringency wash was with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 55 °C. In some instances, after hybridization and autoradiography, primary probes were stripped, and the blots were re-hybridized with a 32P-labeled 18 S rRNA probe of 80 nucleotides, prepared with the T7 MEGAshortscript kit (Ambion) to assess equal RNA loading and blotting. In other instances, rRNA levels were assessed by staining with ethidium.Nuclear Extracts—Cells were rinsed, harvested, and lysed in a hypotonic buffer supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors and 1% Triton X-100. Nuclei were collected and resuspended in hypertonic buffer with phosphatase and protease inhibitors, and soluble nuclear proteins released after 30 min of extraction were collected by centrifugation as described (3McCarthy T.L.

Oligomers for mutant CRE1 (CRE1μ, 5′-CGCGGCCGGGCAATGGTTCGCACCGACCCGGCG-3′) and mutant CRE2 (CRE2μ, 5′-GGGAGGGGCCCCGGCGGATCCCAGCCCGTTGCCAGGCG-3′) (mutated nucleotides indicated by bold underlined italics) were based on previous studies by Niehof et al. (17Niehof M. Manns M. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complementary strands were synthesized and hybridized to their respective partners to prepare 32P-labeled oligomers for EMSA by filling the overhanging single strand regions with dNTPs and [α-32P]dCTP with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Three μg of nuclear protein was preincubated with 2 μg of poly(dI:dC), without or with unlabeled specific or nonspecific competitor DNAs or antibody preparations (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), supplemented with 5 × 104 cpm of probe (0.1 to 0.2 ng) and fractionated through a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography (3McCarthy T.L. Ji C. Chen Y. Kim K. Centrella M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Lee K.A.

Blots were blocked in 5% fat-free powdered milk and probed with specific primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and reactive bands were visualized with secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescence (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (3McCarthy T.L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 43121-43129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Statistics—Statistical differences in biochemical assays were assessed by one-way analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis, using SigmaStat software (Jandel Corp.), from a total of nine or more replicate samples from three or more studies each performed with different cell preparations. A significant difference was assumed by a p value of <0.05.RESULTSPGE2 Induces C/EBPβ Expression—We previously showed that C/EBP is an important regulator of IGF-I expression in PKA-activated osteoblasts, by way of a single high affinity C/EBP binding half-site located within exon 1, a transcribed, noncoding, and highly conserved region of the IGF-I gene. C/EBPδ is the principal endogenous C/EBP in unstimulated osteoblasts (4Umayahara Y. Ji C. Centrella M. Rotwein P. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31793-31800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Close examination of in vitro binding using the IGF-I promoter derived C/EBP binding element, designated HS3D, and nuclear extract from PGE2-activated osteoblasts, showed two prominent complexes and suggested the presence of multiple proteins. As shown in Fig. 1A, antibodies to either C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ each effectively reduced protein binding to this element. The upper gel shift complex that occurred with extract from PGE2-activated osteoblasts was primarily sensitive to anti-C/EBPβ antibody, whereas both complexes were reduced by anti-C/EBPδ antibody, consistent with the importance of heterodimers containing both C/EBP isoforms. Treatment with PGE2 rapidly elevated the levels of C/EBPβ mRNA and protein. A large increase in C/EBPβ mRNA occurred within 1 h of treatment, peaked at 2 h, and declined but remained significantly elevated for at least 24 h (Fig. 1B). By Western immunoblot analysis, a maximal increase in C/EBPβ protein in total osteoblast extract was achieved by 4 h of PGE2 treatment (Fig. 1C).Locating the PGE2-responsive Element in the C/EBPβ Promoter—To locate regulatory elements utilized by osteoblasts after PGE2 activation, cells were transfected with reporter plasmids encoding progressive C/EBPβ promoter truncations. The C/EBPβ promoter fragments shared a common 3′-end at bp +54 but terminated at bp –2700, –1300, or –541 at their 5′-ends. As shown in Fig. 2A, gene expression through each fragment was significantly induced by 6 h of treatment with PGE2. Earlier evidence from studies with hepatocytes showed two important cAMP-sensitive elements downstream of bp –541, located between bp –111 and –61 (17Niehof M. Manns M. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), allowing us to focus our effort more precisely. Indeed, we found that mutation of either or both of these elements within the context of the –541 upstream segment significantly reduced basal C/EBPβ promoter activity in osteoblasts and severely limited the stimulatory effect PGE2 by 75–80%. To assess the kinase systems responsible for the stimulatory effect of PGE2, we co-transfected osteoblasts with the fully functional –541 C/EBPβ promoter-reporter construct and either a mutant regulatory subunit of PKA that blocks its activation (PKAregμ) or a dominant negative PKC (PKCDN) that exerts broad-spectrum PKC isoform inhibition (34McCarthy T.L. Thomas M.J. Centrella M. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Schonwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Expression of the mutant regulatory subunit of PKA completely blocked C/EBPβ promoter activation, whereas expression of the PKCDN protein had no effect (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Functional CREs in the proximal region of the C/EBPβ gene promoter and PKA dependent activation in rat osteoblasts.A, osteoblasts were transfected with 250 ng of reporter plasmids containing fragments of the rat C/EBPβ promoter with 5′-termini at –2700, –1300, or –541 bp and a common 3′-terminus at +54 bp in a total of 500 μl. Mutations introduced into C/EBPβ promoter fragment –541 to +54 to disrupt either or both previously identified CREs between –111 and –61 bp are designated as –541μ1, –541μ2, and –541μ1,2. B, osteoblasts were co-transfected to express 250 ng of the native –541-bp fragment of the C/EBPβ promoter and 100 ng of either a mutated regulatory subunit of PKA (PKAregμ) or a dominant negative PKCα subunit (PKCDN) in a total of 500 μl. Reporter gene activity was measured after 6 h of treatment with vehicle (control) or 1 μm PGE2. Data were corrected for protein content and are the means ± S.E. from 9 or more replicate cultures per condition and 3 or more experiments. *, basal C/EBPβ promoter activity and the stimulatory effect of PGE2 were significantly suppressed (p < 0.05) by either or both CRE mutations (in A) and only by PKAregμ in PGE2-treated osteoblasts (in B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Inducible Protein Binding to CRE1 and CRE2—To assess protein binding to these important CRE elements that occur in the C/EBPβ promoter, we performed EMSA with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides, designated CRE1 and CRE2, corresponding to each element. Nuclear extract from osteoblasts treated for 4 h with PGE2 caused inducible gel shift complexes with each element, and these complexes were competed by excess unlabeled homologous oligonucleotides but not by oligonucleotides in which the CRE1 binding sequences were mutated. Data are shown in Fig. 3A for [32P]CRE1 and unlabeled CREμ1(μ1), but analogous results occurred with [32P]CRE2 and mutated CREμ2. Unlabeled oligonucleotide HS3D, corresponding to the C/EBP binding element in the IGF-I gene (as described in Fig. 1A), did not compete for protein binding to either CRE probe even at a 100-fold molar excess, and neither anti-C/EBPβ nor anti-C/EBPδ antibody reduced complex formation (Fig. 3B). However, although oligonucleotides corresponding to consensus CREB binding sequences effectively competed for nuclear factor binding to these CREs (Fig. 3B), anti-CREB antibody did not alter complex formation (Fig. 3A). Therefore, these CREs appear to have an important effect on PKA-dependent C/EBPβ expression in osteoblasts, and transcription factors other than C/EBP or CREB appear to associate with these elements after treatment with PGE2.Fig. 3PGE2 induces rat osteoblast nuclear factor binding to CREs in the C/EBPβ promoter.A, nuclear extracts from osteoblasts treated for 4 h in serum-free medium with vehicle (0) or 1 μm PGE2 (P) were examined by EMSA with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide CRE1 and with either 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled CRE1 (C1), CRE2 (C2), or mutated CRE1 (μ1) as defined under “Experimental Procedures” or by anti-CREB antibody as indicated. B, nuclear extracts from vehicle or PGE2-treated osteoblasts were examined by EMSA with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide CRE1 and with either a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide HS3D (H) that associate with the C/EBPs or CREB (CB), as defined under “Experimental Procedures,” or anti-C/EBPβ (β) or anti-C/EBPδ (δ) antibody as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fra-2 Binds to CRE1 and CRE2—PGE2 activated the C/EBPβ promoter through a PKA-dependent event, and we speculated that these CREs might bind AP-1-like factors based on their nucleotide sequences and previous evidence from studies in osteoblasts (36Swarthout J.T. D'Alonzo R.C. Selvamurugan N. Partridge N.C. Gene. 2002; 282: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Select AP-1 transcription factors are expressed during osteoblast differentiation (37McCabe L.R. Kockx M. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 38McCabe L.R. Banerjee C. Kundu R. Harrison R.J. Dobner P.R. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore we used a panel of antibodies to various AP-1-binding proteins, C/EBPδ, C/EBPβ, CREB (as shown in Fig. 3), ATF-2, and JunD.2 However, only antibodies specific to the transcription factor Fra-2 effectively modified binding to each of these elements. Again, analogous results occurred with oligonucleotides encoded by element CRE-1 and CRE-2, and data from results obtained using the oligonucleotide specific for CRE-1 are shown in Fig. 4A. Western immunoblot analysis showed that PGE2 induced a rapid accumulation of Fra-2 (Fig. 4B) that was completely blocked by co-treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 4C). Using sequence information obtained from GenBank™, we designed primers to synthesize full-length cDNA encoding rat Fra-2 by reverse transcriptase PCR from total osteoblast RNA. The rat Fra-2 sequence that we cloned was 95% homologous to human Fra-2. All sequence variations appeared to be minor, and the predicted gene products retained a protein sequence homology of 96% (Fig. 5). Using the rat Fra-2 cDNA as a probe, we then examined Fra-2 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Fra-2 mRNA levels increased within 30 min of PGE2 treatment, peaked at 1 h, and remained elevated for at least 4 h (Fig. 4D).Fig. 4PGE2 induces Fra-2 expression in rat osteoblasts.A, nuclear extracts from osteoblasts treated for 4 h in serum-free medium with vehicle (0) or 1 μm PGE2 (P) were examined by EMSA with 32P-labeled oligonucle"
