https://openalex.org/W2093860815,"FROM a mould filtrate we have extracted a new substance with strong antifungal properties. The mould itself, which we were unable to classify completely, belongs to the species Monosporium bonorden and has been isolated from a sample of soil from the Belgian Congo. It develops white, almost sterile mycelia on Czapec-agar, with the reverse of the colonies varying from straw-yellow to brown with age."

https://openalex.org/W2040025357,"WE have formulated a structure for the nucleic acids which is compatible with the main features of the X-ray diagram and with the general principles of molecular structure, and which accounts satisfactorily for some of the chemical properties of the substances. The structure involves three intertwined helical polynucleotide chains. Each chain, which is formed by phosphate di-ester groups and linking β-D-ribofuranose or β-D-deoxyribofuranose residues with 3′, 5′ linkages, has approximately twenty-four nucleotide residues in seven turns of the helix. The helixes have the sense of a right-handed screw. The phosphate groups are closely packed about the axis of the molecule, with the pentose residues surrounding them, and the purine and pyrimidine groups projecting radially, their planes being approximately perpendicular to the molecular axis. The operation that converts one residue to the next residue in the polynucleotide chain is rotation by about 105° and translation by 3.4 A."

https://openalex.org/W1997296480,"A SPECIES of Cephalosporium has been found to produce two different kinds of antibacterial substance1,2. The first consists of a group of acidic antibiotics which are soluble in common organic solvents, are active mainly against Gram-positive organisms2, and show similarities to helvolic acid2–4. The second consists of a substance (or group of substances) which is insoluble in most organic solvents and is active against a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. This has been called ‘cephalosporin N’. Evidence has now been obtained that cephalosporin N is a new type of penicillin."

https://openalex.org/W1971212734,A RECENT letter by Little and Kramer1 reporting some studies on reticulin prompts the submission of a preliminary account of some similar investigations now in progress. Attempts to determine the relation between collagen and reticular fibres using the electron microscope to examine teased-out or otherwise broken-down tissues are open to the criticism that the fibres observed are not histologically identifiable. Kramer and Little appear to have overcome this objection and to have reached the conclusion that the fibrils of reticulin have the same structure as collagen fibrils—a conclusion which the following experiments confirm.

https://openalex.org/W1997114591,"So long ago as 1878, E. A. Schäfer demonstrated in Aurellia a network of bipolar and tripolar nerve cells the processes of which run in all directions, frequently coming close together at points which have been interpreted as synapses1,2. Using Holmes's method of silver staining, I have been able to confirm this histological picture; moreover, the fibres are similar to those of the through-conducting system in the mesenteries of Metridium3. These fibres can be seen clearly in living Aurellia under phase-contrast or oblique illumination."

Selection on the basis of virus tests has resulted in a virus-free clone of the Royal Sovereign variety and revived its commercial cultivation; but except for the recently bred variety Auchincruive Climax, no plants of other widely grown varieties have been found without at least a mild crinkle virus."
https://openalex.org/W3151304013,"IN the course of an investigation of the composition of certain aqueous extracts of tissues from the bean root, the material was examined in an electron microscope. Small spherical granules, slightly smaller in size than the microsomes described by Claude1, Brachet and Jeener2, and Stern3, were detected. The size of the particles varied with the maturity of the tissue from which they were taken."
https://openalex.org/W2064986984,"Daphnia, in common with other branchiopod Crustacea, synthesizes hæmoglobin in response to a deficiency of dissolved oxygen in the surrounding water1. The hæmoglobin is in solution in the blood. In poikilothermal animals, chemical processes in the body normally proceed more rapidly at a high external temperature, and we have found that in Daphnia hæmoglobin synthesis is quicker in warm water. We wished, in addition, to know whether, at the lower of two temperatures, Daphnia would eventually acquire as much hæmoglobin as at the higher temperature (the low oxygen contents of the waters being maintained at the same level) or whether at the higher temperature a greater amount of hæmoglobin would be synthesized. The second alternative proved to be correct. In one experiment with D. obtusa, in water containing approximately 1 ml. dissolved oxygen per litre, the hæmoglobin content of the blood increased, in 28 days, five-fold at 17° C. but seven-fold at 28° C. After that there was no further increase. One cause of the greater synthesis at the higher temperature is probably the low oxygen content of the tissues, due to a high metabolic rate."

https://openalex.org/W2004559325,"MANY methods have already been described for the selective degradation of peptides from the carboxyl end1. However, the several chemical steps involved in those procedures do not allow their utilization on a micro-scale. Linstead, Shephard and Weedon2 have recently published a study on the decarboxylation of α-N-acylamino-acids in alcoholic media by anodic oxidation into alkoxyalkylamides (acylaminoethers), with a 74–91 per cent yield."
