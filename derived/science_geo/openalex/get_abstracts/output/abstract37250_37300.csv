https://openalex.org/W1520989958,"Abstract Ca2+-ATPase molecules present in the microsomal fraction from non-muscle cells were examined immunologically. Rabbit whole brain, cerebellum, liver, kidney, and COS-1 cell microsomes all displayed a polypeptide of about 110 kDa which was immunoreactive with a polyclonal antiserum against the cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase molecule, but was not immunoreactive with a monoclonal antibody specific for the fast-twitch muscle Ca2+-ATPase. cDNAs encoding the full length of two Ca2+-ATPase molecules were isolated from a human kidney library using a mixture of nucleotide probes derived from both rabbit fast-twitch and cardiac muscle Ca2+-ATPase cDNAs. The human kidney cDNAs, HK1 and HK2, are the products of alternative splicing. HK2 codes for a protein identical to rabbit cardiac muscle Ca2+-ATPase, with the exception of 6 scattered amino acid replacements, whereas HK1 codes for a protein identical to that encoded by HK2, but with the carboxyl-terminal 4 amino acids replaced by an extended sequence of 49 amino acids. cDNAs of the HK1 type are by far the most abundant in the library. The partial structure of a 40-kilobase genomic DNA encoding all but the 5' end of the human cardiac Ca2+-ATPase is described. The exons which give rise to the alternatively spliced products were located by Southern blotting and sequencing, and the alternative splicing patterns were determined."
https://openalex.org/W1565034980,"Abstract We describe the results of a study designed to identify cDNAs encoding Ca2+-transporting ATPases and other cation-transporting ATPases of the aspartylphosphate class. Rat brain, kidney, and stomach cDNA libraries were screened with an oligonucleotide hybridization probe corresponding to a 23-amino acid sequence from part of the ATP-binding site of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase. This procedure resulted in the isolation of cDNAs encoding (i) the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase, (ii) an apparent Ca-ATPase that exhibits high amino acid similarity to the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps, (iii) a transport ATPase of unknown ion specificity and (iv) two Ca-ATPase isoforms encoded by the gene for the slow-twitch muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase. Several isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase and gastric H,K-ATPase that had been characterized previously were also identified. The complete nucleotide sequences have been determined for the two classes of cDNA derived from alternatively spliced transcripts of the slow-twitch muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase gene. One of these cDNAs, isolated from the stomach library, encodes a Ca-ATPase that is identical to the skeletal muscle enzyme. The second class of cDNA, found in brain, kidney, and stomach libraries, is identical to that of the slow-twitch isoform throughout much of its length but encodes an alternative C terminus and has a different 3'-untranslated sequence. Whereas the muscle isoform consists of 997 amino acids and terminates with the sequence Ala-Ile-Leu-Glu, the second isoform is 1043 amino acids in length due to the replacement of these last 4 amino acids with a 50-amino acid sequence that contains a potential transmembrane domain followed by a consensus sequence for an N-linked glycosylation site."
https://openalex.org/W1590089681,"Sphingosine is a potent inhibitor of several calmodulin-dependent enzymes. The multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase, and smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase are inhibited in vitro at concentrations previously shown to inhibit protein kinase C. Inhibition of each of the enzymes is competitive with calmodulin, suggesting that sphingosine may be a calmodulin antagonist. In the pituitary cell line GH3, sphingosine inhibits the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 2 by the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and the phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase III. These findings suggest that sphingosine, in blocking the effects of both the Ca2+.calmodulin complex and of diacylglycerol, may be a very effective inhibitor of both branches of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway. By extension, caution should be exercised in the use of sphingosine as a diagnostic test for the involvement of protein kinase C in biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1690961319,"Genetic and biochemical analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing a disruption of the nuclear gene (AAC1) encoding the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier has revealed a second gene for this protein. The second gene, designated AAC2, has been isolated by genetic complementation and sequenced. AAC2 contains a 954-base pair open reading frame coding for a protein of 318 amino acids which is highly homologous to the AAC1 gene product except that it is nine amino acids longer at the NH2 terminus. The two yeast genes are highly conserved at the level of DNA and protein and share identity with the ADP/ATP carriers from other organisms. Both genes complement an ADP/ATP carrier defect (op1 or pet9). However, the newly isolated gene AAC2 need be present only in one or two copies while the previously isolated AAC1 gene must be present in multiple copies to support growth dependent on a functional carrier protein. This gene dosage-dependent complementation combined with the high degree of conservation suggest that these two functionally equivalent genes may be differentially expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1521900320,"The complex formed between the enzyme ribonuclease T1 (EC 3.1.27.3) and its specific inhibitor 2'-guanylic acid (2'-GMP) has been refined to R = 0.180 using x-ray diffraction data to 1.9-A resolution. The protein molecule displays a compact fold; a 4.5 turn alpha-helix packed over an antiparallel beta-pleated sheet shields most of the hydrophobic interior of the protein against the solvent. The extended pleated sheet structure of ribonuclease T1 is composed of three long and four short strands building up a two-stranded minor beta-sheet near the amino terminus and a five-stranded major sheet in the interior of the protein molecule. In the complex with ribonuclease T1, the inhibitor 2'-guanylic acid adopts the syn-conformation and C2'-endo sugar pucker. Binding of the nucleotide is mainly achieved through amino acid residues 38-46 of the protein. The catalytically active amino acid residues of ribonuclease T1 (His40, Glu58, Arg77, and His92) are located within the major beta-sheet which, as evident from the analysis of atomic temperature factors, provides an environment of minimal local mobility. The geometry of the active site is consistent with a mechanism for phosphodiester hydrolysis where, in the transesterification step, His40 and/or Glu58 act as a general base toward the ribose 2'-hydroxyl group and His92, as a general acid, donates a proton to the leaving 5'-hydroxyl group."
https://openalex.org/W1593822574,"An adipose-specific protein has been purified from murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes to greater than 98% homogeneity. A purification procedure was developed utilizing a combination of gel filtration, cation exchange chromatography, and covalent chromatography on activated-thiol Sepharose 4B. The protein exists as a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 15,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein contains 2 mol of reduced sulfhydryl groups per mol of protein and an amino terminus blocked to sequencing. Automated Edman degradation of trypsin and CNBr-derived peptides has verified that the purified protein is that predicted by the mRNA (Bernlohr, D. A., Angus, C. W., Lane, M. D., Bolanowski, M. A., and Kelly, T. J. Jr. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 5468-5472). Based on sequence analysis, the 15-kDa adipocyte protein is considered to be a member of a family of tissue-specific, cytosolic lipid-binding proteins. Utilizing a liposome assay, the purified protein binds both oleic acid and retinoic acid saturably with approximately 1 mol of ligand bound per mol of protein. Dissociation constants determined from Scatchard analysis were 3 and 50 microM, respectively. This report represents the first demonstration of a member of this family of structurally related proteins that is capable of binding both fatty acid and retinoic acid. Hence, we propose the name adipocyte lipid-binding protein, or ALBP."
https://openalex.org/W1636254190,"Long term incubation of proteins with glucose, named the Maillard reaction (Maillard, L. C. (1912) C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris) 154, 66-68), gives rise to advanced glycosylation end product (AGE) with fluorescence, color, as well as cross-linked properties. The receptor-mediated endocytosis of AGE-proteins by macrophages was reported (Vlassara, H., Brownlee, M., and Cerami, A. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 5588-5592). The present study on the binding of AGE-bovine serum albumin (BSA) to rat peritoneal macrophages and sinusoidal liver cells demonstrated the presence of a saturable, high affinity receptor for AGE-BSA with Kd = 2.4 x 10(-7) M (macrophages) and 2.1 x 10(-7) M (sinusoidal cells). The cellular binding of AGE-BSA and its endocytic uptake by these cells were competitively inhibited by BSA preparations modified with aliphatic aldehydes such as formaldehyde or glycolaldehyde, ligands known to be specific for a scavenger receptor for aldehyde-modified proteins (Horiuchi, S., Murakami, M., Takata, K., and Morino, Y. (1986). J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4962-4966). These ligands also had a profound in vivo effect on the plasma clearance of 125I-AGE-BSA as well as its hepatic uptake. Thus, endocytic uptake of AGE-proteins by macrophages appeared to be mediated by a scavenger receptor for aldehyde-modified proteins. This provides evidence for the biological importance of the scavenger receptor in eliminating senescent macromolecules from the circulation."
https://openalex.org/W1562424017,"Acetate kinase was purified 102-fold to a specific activity of 656 mumol of ADP formed/min/mg of protein from acetate-grown Methanosarcina thermophila. The enzyme was not intrinsically membrane bound. The native enzyme (Mr 94,000) was an alpha 2 homodimer with a subunit Mr of 53,000. The activity was optimum between pH 7.0 and 7.4. A pI of 4.7 was determined. The enzyme was stable to O2 and stable to heating at 70 degrees C for 15 min but was rapidly inactivated at higher temperatures. The apparent Km for acetate was 22 mM and for ATP was 2.8 mM. The enzyme phosphorylated propionate at 60% of the rate with acetate but was unable to use formate. TTP, ITP, UTP, GTP, and CTP replaced ATP as the phosphoryl donor to acetate. The enzyme required one of several divalent cations for activity; the maximum rate was obtained with Mn2+. Western blots of cell extract proteins showed that acetate grown cells synthesized higher quantities of the acetate kinase than did methanol grown cells."
https://openalex.org/W2110375774,"The cell surface cAMP receptor of Dictyostelium discoideum exists as a doublet of low (D) and high (R) electrophoretic mobility forms, both of which are phosphorylated in vivo. The R form is phosphorylated in a ligand-independent manner, while conversion of the R to D forms, induced by the chemoattractant, is accompanied by at least a 4-fold increase in the level of phosphorylation. When cells are stimulated with saturating levels of cAMP, increased phosphorylation is detectable within 5 s and reaches maximum levels by 5 min with a t1/2 of 45 s. Dephosphorylation of receptor, initiated by removal of the stimulus, is detectable within 30 s, has a half-time of 2 min, and reaches a plateau by 20 min. At half-maximal occupancy, phosphorylation occurred more slowly than at saturation, t1/2 = 1.5 min, and remained at intermediate levels until the cAMP concentration was increased. Accompanying electrophoretic mobility shifts occurred in all cases with similar, though not identical, kinetics. Both phosphorylation and mobility shift were half-maximal at 5 nM cAMP and saturated at 100 nM. Estimation of the specific activity of each receptor form indicates that not all sites are phosphorylated during the R to D transition; at least half of the sites are phosphorylated after the transition is completed. The rate of incorporation of phosphates into the receptor, held in the D form by cAMP, was less than one-third the rate of ligand-induced incorporation starting with the R form and was approximately twice the basal rate of incorporation. These results are compatible with ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation being an early event in the adaptation of other cAMP-induced responses."
https://openalex.org/W1531743144,"A series of site-specifically cross-linked, three-stranded complexes has been prepared using the RecA protein, form I (covalently closed and negatively supercoiled) pUC19 plasmid, and eight psoralen-monoadducted oligonucleotides between 30 and 107 residues in length. Complexes formed much less efficiently if linearized pUC19 was used as the duplex substrate. Quantitative analysis indicates that although RecA is able to utilize a 30-mer in its homologous pairing reaction, incorporation at 50% efficiency requires a single-stranded substrate at least 50 residues long. These three-stranded complexes have been used to study the action mechanism for cross-link repair by ABC excinuclease, and the results are consistent with the recent model of Van Houten, B., Gamper, H., Holbrook, S. R., Hearst, J. E., and Sancar, A. (1986b) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 8077-8081."
https://openalex.org/W1563825238,"The cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the 165-kDa subunit of the receptor for organic calcium channel blockers (CaCB-receptors) was studied. Tryptic peptide analysis showed that cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates rapidly a serine in one peptide. Up to three peptides containing phosphoserine and -threonine are phosphorylated in a 2-h incubation. The isolated 165-kDa subunit was digested with trypsin and the endoproteinase Lys-C and Glu-C. The rapidly phosphorylated peptide was isolated from each digest. The amino acid sequence was determined by Edman degradation and compared with the deduced amino acid sequence of the CaCB-receptor from rabbit skeletal muscle (Tanabe, T., Takeshima, H., Mikami, A., Flockerzi, V., Takahashi, H., Kangawa, K., Kojima, M., Matsuo, H., Hirose, T., and Numa, S. (1987) Nature 238, 313-318). Phosphoserine was determined as the phenylthiohydantoin-derivative of dithiothreitol-dehydroalanine. The phosphorylated serine was identified as Ser-687 which is localized between the transmembrane regions II and III. A second phosphopeptide was isolated into which phosphate was incorporated into Ser-1617 with a slow time course. This peptide is located in the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the 165-kDa subunit. It is anticipated that phosphorylation of serine 687 affects the opening probability of the calcium channel."
https://openalex.org/W1564079970,"A cellular receptor for erythroid differentiation factor (EDF) was demonstrated by incubation of 125I-labeled EDF with rat follicular granulosa cell cultures. The specific binding of labeled EDF to the cells showed saturation; Scatchard analysis of binding data indicated a single class of receptors having Kd = 3.4 x 10(-10) M. A large excess of unlabeled EDF reduced labeled EDF binding almost completely, whereas similar doses of inhibin and transforming growth factor type beta, which are quite similar to EDF in protein structure and subunit organization, had no effect; EDF did not share receptors with those factors. EDF receptor (activin A receptor) expression was enhanced in granulosa cells cultured in the presence of follicle-stimulating hormone; follicle-stimulating hormone raised the number of EDF binding sites/cell from 13,000 to 96,000 without altering the binding affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1513572409,"The mechanisms by which insulin inhibits catecholamine-induced lipolysis in fat cells are unknown. In this study the possible role of an interaction between insulin and the adrenoceptors on human fat cells was investigated. Insulin inhibited, in a dose-dependent fashion, the specific binding of hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic nonselective beta-receptor radioligands but had no effect on the binding of alpha 2-selective radioligands. The results of saturation experiments and competition-inhibition experiments under both equilibrium conditions and nonequilibrium conditions revealed that insulin reduced the total number of beta-adrenergic binding sites (maximum effect 25%) without changing the beta-adrenoceptor affinity. This insulin effect was rapid and reversible; one-third of the effect occurred within 1 min of incubation and it was completely reversed within 30 min after withdrawal of insulin. It could be mimicked by a polyclonal rabbit insulin receptor antibody but not by insulin mimickers acting distal to the initial interaction between the hormone and its specific insulin-receptor binding site. The beta-adrenoceptor binding to a plasma membrane-enriched fraction decreased at the same time as it increased to a microsomal enriched fraction after insulin treatment, indicating a redistribution of beta-adrenoceptors in the cell. In lipolysis experiments performed under conditions like those in the binding experiments, insulin inhibited the rate of lipolysis with a lag period of 3 min. Furthermore, the hormone caused a dose-dependent maximum 10-fold shift to the right of the dose-response curve for isoprenaline-induced lipolysis without changing the amplitude of the curve. This effect of insulin was specific for the beta-adrenergic receptors system, since insulin markedly decreased the amplitude of the dose-response curve for parathyroid hormone-induced lipolysis. In addition, the effect of insulin on isoprenaline-induced lipolysis could be mimicked by long-lasting fractional inactivation of the beta-adrenoceptors. The dose-response relationships for the inhibitory effects of insulin on beta-adrenoceptor binding and the lipolytic sensitivity to isoprenaline were almost identical. Half-maximum and maximum effects occurred at about 5 and 100 microunits/ml of insulin, respectively. In conclusion, the exposure of human fat cells to physiological insulin doses is followed by a rapid and dose-dependent translocation of beta-adrenoceptors from the exterior to the interior of the cell and a subsequent dose-dependent decrease in the lipolytic sensitivity to beta-adrenergic agonists, without a change in maximum lipolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1499063178,"The viral-specific protease of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been expressed as a lacZ-protease fusion protein. This fusion protein contains protease cleavage sites at the gag/protease and protease/reverse transcriptase junctions and undergoes autoprocessing in vivo when expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified lacZ-protease fusion protein precursors also exhibit autoproteolytic activity in vitro. One cleavage product of the autoprocessing reactions is a 10-kDa protein that cross-reacts with peptide antisera prepared against the putative protease sequence. Consistent with the notion that HIV protease is an acid protease, its autoproteolytic activity is inhibited in alkaline buffers and by pepstatin A. The in vivo and in vitro autocleavage assays for HIV protease together with the overproduction of the protease should facilitate design and testing of therapeutic agents that inhibit gag-pol polyprotein processing and HIV virion maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1501954533,"Addition of growth factors to responsive cells in HCO3- -free media results in a rapid rise in cytoplasmic pH (pHi) caused by activation of Na+/H+ exchange. In this paper, we have examined how pHi regulation and growth factor responsiveness are affected by HCO3(-)using quiescent mouse MES-1 fibroblastic cells as a model. When cells are exposed to 25 mM HCO3-, 5% CO2, steady-state pHi reaches a new more alkaline level (by 0.25 unit) within 10 min. This rise in pHi is both Na+- and HCO3- -dependent, does not occur in Cl(-)-depleted cells, and is inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, but not by 5-(n,n-dimethyl)-amiloride, indicating the involvement of Na+-dependent HCO3-/Cl- exchange. Furthermore, the recovery of pHi from acute acid loads is accelerated by HCO3- in a Na+-dependent and 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive manner and is blocked in Cl(-) -depleted cells. Similar results were obtained for mouse 3T3 cells and human fibroblasts. In the presence of HCO3-/CO2 (pH 7.35), mitogens and phorbol esters fail to induce a detectable rise in pHi. However, when steady-state pHi is artificially lowered by approximately 0.4 unit, growth factors evoke significant increases in pHi due to activation of Na+/H+ exchange. In the absence of HCO3-, mitogen-induced alkalinizations are readily detectable but not when pHi is artificially elevated to the value normally observed in HCO3- media. From these results we conclude that: 1) Na+-dependent HCO3-/Cl- exchange determines steady-state pHi and acts in parallel with Na+/H+ exchange to stimulate pHi recovery from acid loading; 2) Na+-dependent HCO3-/Cl- exchange raises steady-state pHi to a level beyond the operating range of the Na+/H+ exchanger and thereby prevents growth factors from alkalinizing the cytoplasm any further. The results also imply that, unlike Na+/H+ exchange, Na+-dependent HCO3-/Cl- exchange is not activated by mitogens."
https://openalex.org/W1523271573,"When membrane-bound human liver alkaline phosphatase was treated with a phosphatidylinositol (PI) phospholipase C obtained from Bacillus cereus, or with the proteases ficin and bromelain, the enzyme released was dimeric. Butanol extraction of the plasma membranes at pH 7.6 yielded a water-soluble, aggregated form that PI phospholipase C could also convert to dimers. When the membrane-bound enzyme was solubilized with a non-ionic detergent (Nonidet P-40), it had the Mr of a tetramer; this, too, was convertible to dimers with PI phospholipase C or a protease. Butanol extraction of whole liver tissue at pH 6.6 and subsequent purification yielded a dimeric enzyme on electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions, whereas butanol extraction at pH values of 7.6 or above and subsequent purification by immunoaffinity chromatography yielded an enzyme with a native Mr twice that of the dimeric form. This high molecular weight form showed a single Coomassie-stained band (Mr = 83,000) on electrophoresis under denaturing conditions in sodium dodecyl sulfate, as did its PI phospholipase C cleaved product; this Mr was the same as that obtained with the enzyme purified from whole liver using butanol extraction at pH 6.6. These results are highly suggestive of the presence of a butanol-activated endogenous enzyme activity (possibly a phospholipase) that is optimally active at an acidic pH. Inhibition of this activity by maintaining an alkaline pH during extraction and purification results in a tetrameric enzyme. Alkaline phosphatase, whether released by phosphatidylinositol (PI) phospholipase C or protease treatment of intact plasma membranes, or purified in a dimeric form, would not adsorb to a hydrophobic medium. PI phospholipase C treatment of alkaline phosphatase solubilized from plasma membranes by either detergent or butanol at pH 7.6 yielded a dimeric enzyme that did not absorb to the hydrophobic medium, whereas the untreated preparations did. This adsorbed activity was readily released by detergent. Likewise, alkaline phosphatase solubilized from plasma membranes by butanol extraction at pH 7.6 would incorporate into phosphatidylcholine liposomes, whereas the enzyme released from the membranes by PI phospholipase C would not incorporate. The dimeric enzyme purified from a butanol extract of whole liver tissue carried out at pH 6.6 did not incorporate. We conclude that PI phospholipase C converts a hydrophobic tetramer of alkaline phosphatase into hydrophilic dimers through removal of the 1,2-diacylglycerol moiety of phosphatidylinositol. Based on these and others' findings, we devised a model of alkaline phosphatase's conversion into its various forms."
https://openalex.org/W1502153098,"The exchange coupling of reduced uteroferrin has been measured (19.8(5) cm-1 S1.S2) using recently developed techniques for studying metalloprotein magnetization. A spin Hamiltonian describing the coupled binuclear Fe(II).Fe(III) center has been used to fit the low and high field magnetization data, the EPR g values, and the highly anisotropic hyperfine tensor of the ferric site. The exchange coupling of the phosphate complex of reduced uteroferrin has also been measured (6.0(5) cm-1 S1.S2) using the same techniques. The smaller exchange coupling of the phosphate complex is comparable with the zero field splittings of the iron sites. This results in increased sensitivity of the system g values (found by calculation from the spin Hamiltonian) to variations of the zero field splitting parameters arising from heterogeneities in the protein microenvironment. Consequently, there is a very significant (9-fold) increase in the effective g strain of the system compared to the situation in the absence of phosphate. This, together with the larger g anisotropy (g = (1.06, 1.51, 2.27)), gives rise to an EPR signal for the phosphate complex of reduced uteroferrin which is extremely broad and difficult to detect but which has now been identified for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W1515631786,"Recent studies involving a variety of membrane receptors and ion channels indicate that diversity exists among these proteins as evidenced by tissue-specific and developmentally related expression of different isoforms. Alpha 2-Adrenergic receptors, plasma membrane proteins involved in sympathetic neurotransmission, may similarly represent a nonhomogeneous class of binding sites based on the following observations. First, their activation can elicit a wide variety of effector cell responses, which are apparently triggered by at least three different signal transduction mechanisms. Second, alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in various tissues and species exhibit marked differences in their ligand recognition properties. To determine if heterogeneity of the receptor protein itself is involved in generating this diversity, we structurally characterized the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor in two tissues that exhibit the greatest differences in ligand recognition properties, neonatal rat lung and human platelet. We report here that these differences in ligand recognition are maintained after partial receptor purification (50-100-fold) and are associated with distinct differences in the physical and structural properties of the receptor protein. The human platelet and neonatal rat lung receptor differ in the apparent molecular weight of their hormone-binding subunits (human platelet, Mr approximately 64,000 versus neonatal rat lung, Mr approximately 44,000) as well as in the number or type of their associated oligosaccharide moieties. The observed diversity is consistent with expression of isoforms of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor and suggests the presence of more than one gene encoding similar but distinct receptor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1492857994,"Bacteriophage T7 gene 4 protein, purified from phage-infected cells, consists of a mixture of a 56- and a 63-kDa species that provides primase and helicase activities for T7 DNA replication. The 56-kDa species has been purified 1800-fold from Escherichia coli cells containing a plasmid that encodes this gene 4 protein. The purified 56-kDa protein is homogeneous, as determined by denaturing gel electrophoresis, and is monomeric in its native form, as indicated by gel filtration. The binding of the 56-kDa protein to single-stranded DNA is stimulated by nucleoside 5'-triphosphates, as is the case for a mixture of the two molecular weight species. In the presence of DNA, the 56-kDa protein preferentially hydrolyzes dTTP (Bernstein, J. A., and Richardson, C. C. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 396-400). Since nucleoside 5'-triphosphatase activity is necessary for both helicase activity and for translocation of gene 4 protein to primase recognition sites, we have characterized this activity using the 56-kDa protein alone. In the DNA-dependent hydrolysis reaction, the enzyme displays a Km of 10 mM for dTTP, and a Vmax of 2.9 x 10(-5) M/min/mg of protein (at 2.5 micrograms/ml). There is little cooperativity with respect to dTTP binding (Hill coefficient = 1.1) except in the presence of ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate, an inhibitor of dTTP hydrolysis (Hill coefficient greater than 1.5). The apparent KD for single-stranded circular DNA is 0.2 microM. The active species in dTTP hydrolysis is an oligomer of at least two subunits, as indicated by the effect of enzyme concentration upon the rate of DNA-dependent hydrolysis. The 56-kDa protein also catalyzes DNA-independent hydrolysis of dTTP with a Km of 0.11 mM and a Vmax of 1.3 x 10(-7) M/min/mg of protein (at 8 micrograms/ml). The active species in DNA-independent dTTP hydrolysis is also an oligomer."

https://openalex.org/W1525267478,"N alpha-Acetyltransferase, which catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the alpha-NH2 group of proteins and peptides, was isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrated by protein sequence analysis to be NH2-terminally blocked. The enzyme was purified 4,600-fold to apparent homogeneity by successive purification steps using DEAE-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, DE52 cellulose, and Affi-Gel blue. The Mr of the native enzyme was estimated to be 180,000 +/- 10,000 by gel filtration chromatography, and the Mr of each subunit was estimated to be 95,000 +/- 2,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme has a pH optimum near 9.0, and its pI is 4.3 as determined by chromatofocusing on Mono-P. The enzyme catalyzed the transfer of an acetyl group to various synthetic peptides, including human adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (1-24) and its [Phe2] analogue, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase I (1-24), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase II (1-24), and human superoxide dismutase (1-24). These peptides contain either Ser or Ala as NH2-terminal residues which together with Met are the most commonly acetylated NH2-terminal residues (Persson, B., Flinta, C., von Heijne, G., and Jornvall, H. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 152, 523-527). Yeast enolase, containing a free NH2-terminal Ala residue, is known not to be N alpha-acetylated in vivo (Chin, C. C. Q., Brewer, J. M., and Wold, F. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1377-1384), and enolase (1-24), a synthetic peptide mimicking the protein's NH2 terminus, was not acetylated in vitro by yeast acetyltransferase. The enzyme did not catalyze the N alpha-acetylation of other synthetic peptides including ACTH(11-24), ACTH(7-38), ACTH(18-39), human beta-endorphin, yeast superoxide dismutase (1-24). Each of these peptides has an NH2-terminal residue which is rarely acetylated in proteins (Lys, Phe, Arg, Tyr, Val, respectively). Among a series of divalent cations, Cu2+ and Zn2+ were demonstrated to be the most potent inhibitors. The enzyme was inactivated by chemical modification with diethyl pyrocarbonate and N-bromosuccinimide."
https://openalex.org/W1516409109,"Previous studies have shown that activators of the protein kinase A pathway increase transcription of the genes encoding the alpha- and beta-subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in choriocarcinoma cell lines. Here, we show that treatment of choriocarcinoma cells with activators of protein kinase C, such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and dioctanoylglycerol, increases accumulation of the mRNAs for both subunits of hCG by 3-4-fold. In contrast, a phorbol ester which fails to activate protein kinase C, phorbol 12 beta,13 alpha-didecanoate, has no effect on hCG mRNA levels. To test the possibility that these two major intracellular signaling pathways interact, we treated choriocarcinoma cells with PMA, forskolin, or PMA and forskolin together. Treatment with either agent led to a 2-3-fold increase in hCG mRNA levels, whereas treatment with both agents resulted in a 9-fold increase. This synergistic response also occurred when choriocarcinoma cells were treated with PMA and 8-Br-cAMP. Furthermore, PMA did not increase intracellular cAMP levels, suggesting that these two pathways interact subsequent to cAMP generation. PMA also increased transcription of the hCG alpha- and beta-genes by 2-3-fold. Whereas transcription of the alpha subunit gene increases synergistically after treatment with both PMA and forskolin, transcription of the hCG beta-gene was limited to the increase caused by either agent alone. This latter result suggests that regulation of hCG beta mRNA accumulation is more complex than that of alpha-subunit mRNA and probably involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional components."
https://openalex.org/W1546673345,"Ubiquitinated derivatives of histones H2A and H2B, in which the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin is joined to epsilon-amino groups of specific lysine residues of each histone, occur in vivo. Certain ubiquitin carrier proteins (E2s) catalyze ubiquitin transfer to histones (Pickart, C. M., and Rose, I. A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1573-1581). The catalytic activities of these purified ubiquitin carrier proteins have been quantitatively characterized with purified histones, in order to determine if one or more of them exhibits specificity for H2A over other histones (H3,H4) which are not known to be ubiquitinated in vivo. The results show the following. 1) No E2 exhibits strong specificity for H2A over the other histones. 2) For a given histone, kinetics of formation of its monoubiquitinated adduct do not differ strongly among the E2s; sigmoid kinetics (nH = 2) are generally observed, with values of K 0.5 ranging from 2-6 microM. 3) E214K catalyzes primarily monoubiquitination. 4) E220K catalyzes multiple ubiquitination (up to three ubiquitin/histone) by a processive mechanism that involves joining of ubiquitin carboxyl termini to multiple histone lysine residues. 5) E235K also catalyzes processive ubiquitination, with formation of polyubiquitinated products exhibiting a lag phase. Many of the polyubiquitinated adducts produced at low histone concentration are larger than expected for monoubiquitination of every histone-lysine residue, and polyubiquitination is selectively inhibited by substitution of reductively methylated ubiquitin for ubiquitin. These results suggest that E235K uniquely catalyzes ubiquitin transfer to lysine residues of previously conjugated ubiquitin molecule(s). The implications of these results for biological mechanisms of histone ubiquitination are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1486797047,"The E1-glycoprotein (Mr = 26,014; 228 amino acids) of mouse hepatitis virus A59 is a class III membrane glycoprotein which has been used in this study as a model system in the study of membrane integration and protein transport. The protein lacks an NH2-terminal cleavable signal sequence and spans the viral membrane three times. Hydrophobic domains I and III could serve as signal sequences for cotranslational membrane integration. Domain I alone was sufficient to translocate the hydrophilic NH2 terminus of E1 across the membranes as evidenced by glycosylation of a newly introduced N-glycosylation site. The COOH-terminal part of E1 involving amino acids Leu124 to Thr228 was found to associate tightly with membranes at the post-translational level, although this part of the molecule lacks pronounced hydrophobic sequences. Membrane protection assays with proteinase K showed that a 2-kDa hydrophilic fragment was removed from the COOH terminus of E1 indicating that the protein is largely embedded into the membrane. Microinjection of in vitro transcribed capped and polyadenylated mRNA into CV-1 cells or into secretory AtT20 pituitary tumor cells showed that the E1-protein accumulated in the Golgi but was not detectable at the plasma membrane or in secretory granules. The 28 NH2-terminal hydrophilic amino acid residues play no role in membrane assembly or in intracellular targeting. Various NH2-terminal portions of E1 were fused to Ile145 of the cytoplasmic N-protein of mouse hepatitis virus. The resulting hybrid proteins were shown to assemble into membranes in vitro and were detected either in the rough endoplasmic reticulum or transient vesicles of microinjected cells."
https://openalex.org/W1536314019,"The angiotensin II receptor of cultured rat hepatocytes was characterized using [3H]angiotensin II as radioligand. Binding at 23 degrees C was rapid (t1/2 = 0.65 min) with equilibrium being reached in 10-12 min. At this time, binding was completely reversible after 20 min (t1/2 = 3.5 min), indicating negligible internalization of the ligand. Analysis of the saturation binding curve showed one population of binding sites with an apparent KD of 8.6 nM and a Bmax of 35 fmol/mg of protein. The time courses of association and dissociation were also consistent with one class of binding sites with an apparent kinetically derived KD of 7.7 nM. The order of potency of different agonists and antagonists to increase cytosolic Ca2+ or phosphorylase a or inhibit the effects of angiotensin II on these parameters was the same as for their mimicry or reversal of angiotensin II inhibition of glucagon-induced cAMP accumulation, and was well correlated with their order of potency to inhibit angiotensin II specific binding. Treatment of cultured hepatocytes with dithiothreitol caused a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of angiotensin II binding and corresponding alterations of angiotensin II effects on phosphorylase and cAMP. It also inhibited the actions of other hormones on phosphorylase. These results indicate that hepatocytes contain a homogeneous population of angiotensin II receptors that are coupled to two different biological effects apparently mediated by different G-proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1541677767,"The subunit location of the [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], and [4Fe-4S] clusters in Escherichia coli fumarate reductase has been investigated by EPR studies of whole cells or whole cells extracts of a fumarate reductase deletion mutant with plasmid amplified expression of discrete fumarate reductase subunits or groups of subunits. The results indicate that both the [2Fe-2S] and [3Fe-4S] clusters are located entirely in the iron-sulfur protein subunit. Information concerning the specific cysteine residues that ligate these clusters has been obtained by investigating the EPR characteristics of cells of the deletion mutant amplified with a plasmid coding for the flavoprotein subunit and a truncated iron-sulfur protein subunit. While the results are not definitive with respect to the location of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, they are most readily interpreted in terms of this cluster being entirely in the flavoprotein subunit or bridging between the two catalytic domain subunits. These new results are discussed in light of the amino acid sequences of the two subunits and the sequences of structurally well characterized iron-sulfur proteins containing [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], and [4Fe-4S] centers."
https://openalex.org/W1596522081,"dnaT and dnaC of Escherichia coli, whose products are components of the primosome, encode genes essential for both normal chromosomal replication and stable DNA replication induced by SOS signals. dnaT and dnaC together with an unknown gene (P-18), which encodes an 18-kDa polypeptide present downstream of dnaC, are cotranscribed from a promoter located 104 base pairs upstream of dnaT. A portion of the transcripts are processed 16 or 27 base pairs upstream of the dnaC coding region and 20% of the transcripts extending through dnaC are terminated at a terminator 103 base pairs downstream of dnaC. The rest of the transcripts pass through this terminator and are terminated downstream of the P-18 gene. The predicted amino acid sequence of the P-18 protein indicate the presence of a 26-amino acid signal peptide at its N terminus, suggesting that this protein may be secreted into the membrane or a periplasmic space. Another gene, which encodes a 14-kDa hydrophobic protein (P-14), was identified upstream of dnaT. The P-14 gene is transcribed from an upstream promoter, and its transcript extends through dnaT and dnaC. These results indicate that dnaT and dnaC constitute an operon with two unknown genes whose products may be associated with a membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1498066542,"The role of the primosome assembly and protein n' recognition site in replication of pBR322 plasmid was examined. The following evidence indicates that the primosome is involved in lagging-strand synthesis of pBR322 plasmid replication in vitro. Early replicative intermediates with newly synthesized leading strand, approximately 1 kilobase pair long, immediately downstream of the replication origin accumulate in products synthesized in extracts from a dnaT strain that lacks primosomal protein i or in wild-type extracts supplemented with anti-protein i antibody. These intermediates are converted efficiently into full-length DNA by addition of purified protein i. Consistent with the previously proposed role of the primosome (Arai, K. and Kornberg, A. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 69-73), an n' site on the lagging strand, but not on the leading strand, is required for efficient replication of the plasmid in vitro. Plasmids lacking an n' site on the lagging strand replicate only to a limited extent in vitro and early replicative intermediates carrying nascent leading strands are accumulated, although a portion of the intermediates complete replication to yield full-length DNA. The latter reaction is completely inhibited by addition of anti-protein i antibody. Insertion of the n' site of phage phi X174 into pBR322 plasmids lacking lagging-strand n' sites restores the replicative ability of the mutant plasmid comparable to that of the wild-type plasmid. These results indicate that protein i is essential for lagging-strand synthesis of pBR322 plasmid in vitro and that it may play an important role in the priming events as a part of either an n' site-dependent primosome or an n' site-independent, as yet unidentified, priming complex."
https://openalex.org/W1526872343,"We have previously shown that the biologically important reactive oxygen metabolite hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) stimulates arachidonic acid (AA) release and thromboxane A2 synthesis in the rat alveolar macrophage. We have now investigated the effects of H2O2 on alveolar macrophage 5-lipoxygenase metabolism. H2O2 failed to stimulate detectable synthesis of leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, or 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) as determined by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and sensitive radioimmunoassays (RIAs). This was not explained by oxidative degradation of leukotrienes by H2O2 at the concentrations used. Moreover, RIA and RP-HPLC analyses demonstrated that H2O2 dose-dependently inhibited synthesis of leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, and 5-HETE induced by the agonists A23187 (10 microM) and zymosan (100 micrograms/ml), over the same concentration range at which it augmented synthesis of the cyclooxygenase products thromboxane A2 and 12-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid. Four lines of evidence suggested that H2O2 inhibited alveolar macrophage leukotriene and 5-HETE synthesis by depleting cellular ATP, a cofactor for 5-lipoxygenase. 1) H2O2 depleted ATP in A23187- and zymosan-stimulated alveolar macrophages with a dose dependence very similar to that for inhibition of agonist-induced leukotriene synthesis. 2) The time courses of ATP depletion and inhibition of leukotriene B4 synthesis by H2O2 were compatible with a rate-limiting effect of ATP on leukotriene synthesis in H2O2-exposed cultures. 3) Treatment of alveolar macrophages with the electron transport inhibitor antimycin A prior to A23187 stimulation depleted ATP and inhibited leukotriene B4 and C4 synthesis to equivalent degrees, while thromboxane A2 production was spared. 4) Incubation with the ATP precursors inosine plus phosphate attenuated both ATP depletion and inhibition of leukotriene B4 and C4 synthesis in alveolar macrophages stimulated with A23187 in the presence of H2O2. Our results show that H2O2 has the capacity to act both as an agonist for macrophage AA metabolism, and as a selective inhibitor of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, probably as a result of its ability to deplete ATP. Depletion of cellular energy stores by oxidants generated during inflammation in vivo may be a means by which the inflammatory response is self-limited."
https://openalex.org/W1608887238,"The catabolic system, translocating then beta-oxidizing fatty acids in the mitochondria and considered as the major energy generator in the heart, was shown in the present study to be strongly regulated by fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), a self-aggregated and exclusive protein for the binding and transport of fatty acids in the cardiac cell cytoplasm. The mechanism behind this regulation was investigated by using new techniques in this field: i.e. electron spin resonance (ESR) and spin-labeling for the simultaneous analysis of partitioning and beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the isolated cardiac mitochondria. The step of this catabolic system which is controlled by FABP was shown to be the acylcarnitine transfer into the mitochondria. Two of the multi-self-aggregated FABP molecular species, namely those existing at FABP concentrations around 1.1 and 2.2 g.liter-1, were found to act as specific translocators delivering acylcarnitine to the mitochondrial beta-oxidative system. The energy production in the heart might thus be critically dependent on optimized FABP concentrations in the cardiac cells."
https://openalex.org/W1669639990,"The effect of the glucagon receptor on the activation of the stimulatory GTP-binding protein of adenylyl cyclase (Gs) in the native rat liver membrane environment was studied. The activated state of Gs was assessed by its ability to reconstitute the cyc- S49 cell membrane adenylyl cyclase. The Gs protein was activated by saturating concentrations of guanosine 5'-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S) or guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate in a hormone-dependent manner at 0.4 mM Mg2+ in native membranes or in membranes that had been treated with 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide to eliminate the catalytic activity of adenylyl cyclase. At 50 mM Mg2+, Gs was fully activated by GTP gamma S in the absence of hormone. The unactivated Gs protein migrates around 4 S, whereas activated Gs migrates around 2 S on sucrose density gradients. When pure Gs is analyzed on sucrose density gradients, it is found that the unactivated protein migrates at 4.1 S. Gs was activated by saturating concentrations of GTP gamma S and Mg2+, and the alpha subunit of Gs was chromatographically purified. The resolved alpha subunit of Gs that is capable of stimulating the cyc- adenylyl cyclase migrates at 2.1 S. From these data, we conclude that activation of Gs results in the dissociation of this protein in the membrane environment and that the hormone-occupied receptor promotes this dissociation process under conditions where Mg2+ ions are limiting."
https://openalex.org/W1561729644,"A cell-specific isozyme of calmodulin (CaM)-dependent phosphodiesterase that exhibits micromolar affinity for cAMP has been purified 900-fold from mouse testis by DEAE chromatography, gel filtration, affinity chromatography with CaM-Sepharose 4B, and isoelectric focusing. The highly purified enzyme is stimulated 5-6-fold by CaM in the presence of Ca2+ and hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP with anomalous substrate dependence, i.e. high and low affinity components (Km 2 and 20 microM) are observed either in the presence or absence of CaM. Each of the substrates acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the other, suggesting the presence of two distinct catalytic sites on the enzyme. Hydrodynamic studies suggest that the testis phosphodiesterase is an asymmetric monomer of 68-70 kDa that forms a dimer after interaction with Ca2+ and CaM; the tetrameric complex exhibits an apparent molecular size of 180 kDa. These enzymatic and biophysical properties differ in many respects from those of the brain isozyme, suggesting that they are different proteins. Nevertheless, common epitopes do exist, since the testis enzyme interacted with rabbit antibodies raised against bovine brain CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase. The major peptide of 68 kDa was strongly reactive on immunoblots, and was distinguished unambiguously from the 60-kDa species from mouse brain. A comparison of the immunoreactive fragments produced by limited proteolysis with staphylococcal V-8 protease indicated several similarities in the domains of these polypeptides. Thus, although differing in several important physical and biochemical parameters, the testis enzyme appears immunologically related to CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase from brain. On the basis of these data, we conclude that common elements of the structural genes for these isozymes have been conserved, whereas certain biological properties, including substrate specificity, have diverged substantially."
https://openalex.org/W1514187763,"Previous covalent modification studies showed that tyrosine 114 of Escherichia coli ADP-glucose synthetase is involved in substrate binding (Lee, Y. M., and Preiss, J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1058-1064). We have prepared, via site-directed mutagenesis, an E. coli ADP-glucose synthetase variant (Phe114) containing a Tyr114 to Phe substitution in order to test whether the phenolic hydroxyl group plays a critical role in catalysis. Kinetic characterization of Phe114 ADP-glucose synthetase indicates that the Tyr114 hydroxyl is not obligatory for the enzyme catalysis. However, the variant enzyme showed altered properties. It showed a decreased apparent affinity for the substrates. The variant enzyme showed less than 2-fold activation by 5 mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in the ADP-glucose synthesis direction. In contrast, in the pyrophosphorolysis direction, the mutant enzyme showed about a 30-fold activation by 5 mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The variant enzyme is heat-labile compared to wild type enzyme. It lost about 60% enzyme activity on incubation at 65 degrees C for 5 min in the presence of 30 mM Pi. The wild type enzyme is stable under these conditions. The results indicate that tyrosine 114 is involved directly or indirectly in enzyme catalysis, but is not obligatory for the enzyme catalysis. Conversion of Tyr114 to Phe also alters the regulatory properties of the enzyme with respect to activation by fructose-1,6-P2 and inhibition by AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1526765789,"The level of cyclic AMP in primary cultures of bovine adrenal medulla cells is elevated by prostaglandin E1. Angiotensin II is commonly reported to act on receptors linked to phosphoinositide metabolism or to inhibition of adenylate cyclase. We have investigated the effect of angiotensin II on prostaglandin E1-stimulated cyclic AMP levels in these primary cultures. Rather than reducing cyclic AMP levels, we have found that angiotensin II powerfully potentiates prostaglandin E1-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in intact cells, both in the presence and absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The 50% maximal response was similar to that for stimulation of phosphoinositide breakdown by angiotensin II in these cultures. The potentiation of stimulated cyclic AMP levels was seen, although to a smaller maximum, with the protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) activating phorbol ester tetradecanoyl phorbolacetate and with the synthetic diacylglycerol 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol; pretreatment (24 h) with active phorbol ester, which would be expected to diminish protein kinase C levels, attenuated the angiotensin II potentiation of cyclic AMP. Using digitonin-permeabilized cells we showed that adenylate cyclase activity was stimulated by prostaglandin E1 with the same dose-response relationship as was cyclic AMP accumulation in intact cells, but the permeabilized cells showed no response to angiotensin II. The results are discussed with respect to the hypothesis that the angiotensin II influence on cyclic AMP levels is mediated, in part, by diacylglycerol stimulation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1603895073,"The capabilities of five recombinant plasmids, containing relatively long (approximately 60-100 base pairs) perfect inverted repeat (IR) inserts, to support supercoil stabilized non-B-DNA structures were studied in vitro. The IRs were also alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences, thus, each could form either left-handed Z-DNA or cruciforms. Single-strand specific endonucleases, restriction endonucleases and methylases, and OsO4 modifications were used to characterize the DNA structures. Two-dimensional gel electrophoretic studies indicated that three of the five IRs formed both cruciforms and Z-DNA. (C-G) containing inserts preferred to form Z-DNA, whereas (T-G) sequences favored cruciforms. In vivo supercoil relaxation experiments demonstrated the existence of cruciforms in Escherichia coli. The physiological significance of these structures is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1488263217,"Cell transformation is associated with a dramatic collapse of a graphic fingerprint characteristic of normal cells, as measured by phase fluorimetry. This is demonstrated on adenosine deaminase (ADA, EC 3.5.4.4), an established malignancy marker. ADA activity is known to decrease markedly in chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) transformed by Rous sarcoma virus. The high affinity between the catalytic small subunit ADA (SS-ADA) and its membranal complexing protein (ADCP) (which abounds on the plasma membrane of CEF) allowed the hybridization of fluorescent labeled SS-ADA with native ADCP on CEF. Multifrequency differential phase fluorimetry responded remarkably to the state of this hybrid membrane protein. The transformation process is shown to have led to increased membrane fluidity and rotational mobility of ADCP as well as to its reduced availability to SS-ADA binding. The hypothesis of protein vertical sinking into the lipid core of the membrane is now given support by our spectroscopic data. Additional models are considered. A regulatory role is thus suggested for the complexing protein, which may also account for (a) reduced ADA activity in transformed cells and (b) detachment, exclusive to normal cells, upon addition of SS-ADA in excess."
https://openalex.org/W1533993035,"Previous studies have shown that the Dolichos biflorus plant contains a lectin in its stems and leaves, called DB58, that is closely related to the D. biflorus seed lectin. DB58 is a heterodimer composed of two closely related subunits. Immunoprecipitation of total translation products from D. biflorus stem and leaf mRNA suggests a single polypeptide precursor for both of these subunits. Several identical cDNA clones representing the entire coding region of the DB58 mRNA have been isolated from a D. biflorus stem and leaf cDNA library. The DB58 cDNA represents an mRNA encoding a polypeptide of Mr = 29,545. The predicted polypeptide is equal in length to the larger subunit of DB58 with the addition of a 22-amino acid amino-terminal signal sequence. The sequence of the DB58 lectin exhibits 84% homology to the D. biflorus seed lectin at the amino acid level, suggesting that these lectins are encoded by differentially expressed genes and may have evolved to carry out tissue-specific functions. Comparison of the DB58 sequence to other leguminous seed lectins indicates a high degree of structural conservation."
https://openalex.org/W1519650173,"Insertion mutations in the DpnI gene cassette of Streptococcus pneumoniae indicated that the two genes it contains, dpnC and dpnD, were transcribed from an adjacent promoter and that only dpnC was necessary for expression of the DpnI endonuclease. Large amounts of the DpnI endonuclease were produced from the cloned cassette in an Escherichia coli expression system, and the enzyme was purified to homogeneity. The DpnI endonuclease is composed of a single polypeptide of 30 kDa, which, as shown by NH2-terminal sequencing of the protein, is encoded by the entire dpnC open reading frame. The native protein sedimented as a monomer of 30 kDa in 0.5 M NaCl. A protein composed of a 20-kDa polypeptide, which is presumably encoded by dpnD, was also produced in large amounts. It was partially purified, but its function is unknown. Examination of the predicted amino acid sequence of DpnI revealed a potential metal-containing, DNA-binding finger structure. It is suggested that this structure provides the specificity for recognition of the methylated DNA sequence, 5′-GmATC-3′, that is cleaved by the DpnI endonuclease."

The substrate ATP affords substantial protection against inactivation. The extent of chemical modification by the affinity label was determined by measuring the spectroscopic properties of AP4-pyridoxyl chromophores attached to the enzyme after reduction with NaBH4. The incorporation of 2 mol of the affinity label per enzyme dimer is needed for complete inactivation of the kinase. After chymotryptic digestion of the enzyme modified with AP4-PL and reduced with tritiated NaBH4, only one radioactive peptide absorbing at 325 nm was separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the radioactive peptide, elucidated by Edman degradation, revealed that a specific lysyl residue of monomeric pyridoxal kinase has reacted with the affinity label reagent. It is postulated that the modified lysyl residue is involved in direct interactions with phosphoryl groups of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1514785696,"Insulin shifts the steady-state subcellular distribution of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) receptors from a large intracellular pool to the plasma membrane in the rat adipose cell (Wardzala, L. J., Simpson, I. A., Rechler, M. M., and Cushman, S. W. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8378-8383). In the present study, the counterregulatory effects of adrenergic stimulation, adenosine deaminase, and cAMP on this process were studied. Both isoproterenol (10(-6) M) and adenosine deaminase reduced insulin sensitivity and also rapidly (t1/2 approximately 1.5 min) decreased the effect of a maximal insulin concentration on the number of cell surface IGF-II receptors by 35-50%, and by 70% when added together. The marked reduction in binding was retained in isolated and solubilized plasma membranes. Both isoproterenol and adenosine deaminase alone increased the EC50 for insulin from 0.06 to 0.17 nM and, when combined, to 0.6 nM. N6-Monobutyryl-cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP were equally potent in reducing IGF-II binding in the absence of insulin and inhibited maximal insulin-stimulated IGF-II binding by 60 and 30%, respectively. However, only the nonhydrolyzable cAMP analogue, N6-monobutyryl-cAMP, reduced the insulin sensitivity (EC50 0.7 nM). An important stimulatory role for Gi (guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein that inhibits adenylate cyclase) was indicated by the altered activities of cells from pertussis toxin-treated animals. The results suggest that beta-adrenergic stimulation through a cAMP-dependent mechanism markedly alters the insulin-stimulated redistribution of IGF-II receptors. This effect is additional to the potent antagonistic action of cAMP on insulin's signalling mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1598745052,"A protein phosphatase which dephosphorylates phospholamban was purified from canine cardiac cytosol. Purification involved sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, polylysine-agarose, heparin-agarose, Mono Q HR 10/10, and Superose 6. The enzyme was composed of three subunits with Mr = 63,000, 55,000, and 38,000, and it could dephosphorylate the sites on phospholamban phosphorylated by either cAMP-dependent or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Phospholamban phosphatase activity was enhanced 12-, 9-, and 3-fold by the divalent cations Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+, respectively. The phosphatase was inhibited by PPi, ATP, NaF, and Pi and the degree of inhibition was different with each compound. The substrate specificity of the purified phosphatase for cardiac phosphoproteins was determined using troponin I, phospholamban, and highly enriched sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations, phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The phosphatase exhibited the highest activity with phospholamban as substrate. Thus, dephosphorylation of phospholamban by this phosphatase may participate in regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum function in cardiac muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1666125503,"Abstract An enzyme with FAD pyrophosphatase activity was extracted from human placental syncytiotrophoblast microvilli and purified to near-homogeneity. The enzyme has been identified as 5'-nucleotidase by several criteria. Throughout purification, parallel increases in the specific activities of FAD pyrophosphatase and AMP phosphatase were observed. The enzyme was a glycoprotein with a subunit molecular weight of 74,000. EDTA treatment resulted in a marked decline in both activities, and restoration of FAD pyrophosphatase activity but not 5'-nucleotidase activity was accomplished by the addition of Co2+ or, to a lesser extent, Mn2+. The substrate specificity of the 5'-nucleotidase activity that we observed agreed closely with the results of others. The pyrophosphatase activity was relatively specific for FAD. ADP, ATP, NAD(H), and FMN were not hydrolyzed, and ADP strongly inhibited both activities. For FAD pyrophosphatase activity, a Km of 1.2 x 10(-5) M and a Vmax of 1.1 mumol/min/mg protein were determined in assays performed in the presence of Co2+. In the absence of added Co2+, the Vmax declined but the Km was unchanged. For 5'-nucleotidase (AMP as substrate) the Km was 4.1 x 10(-5) M and the Vmax 109 mumol/min/mg protein. Hydrolysis of FMN to riboflavin was observed in partially purified detergent extracts of microvilli that contained alkaline phosphatase activity and lacked FAD pyrophosphatase and 5'-nucleotidase activity. The presence of both FAD pyrophosphatase and FMN phosphatase activities in syncytiotrophoblast microvilli supports the view that the placental uptake of vitamin B2 involves the hydrolysis of FAD and FMN to riboflavin which is then absorbed, a sequence postulated for intestinal absorption and liver uptake."
https://openalex.org/W1507684887,"The activity of the Calvin cycle enzyme phosphoribulokinase is coupled to photosynthetic electron transport by reversible oxidation/reduction mediated by thioredoxin-f. Previous studies have shown that one of the regulatory sulfhydryl groups, that of Cys-16, is positioned at the nucleotide-binding domain of the active site. To determine if oxidative deactivation of the kinase reflects catalytic essentiality of Cys-16, the methylation of spinach phosphoribulokinase by methyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonate has been examined. Methylation of the kinase results in a 50% loss of the initial activity relative to controls. The suppression of kcat is accompanied by a 6-fold increase in the Km for ATP, without change in the Km for ribulose 5-phosphate. The insensitivity of the modified enzyme, in contrast to the native, to iodoacetate and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) indicates that Cys-16 is a site of methylation. This supposition is verified independently by peptide mapping and Edman degradation subsequent to S-carboxymethylation with [14C]iodoacetate of the methylated kinase. Retention of significant enzymatic activity after complete modification of Cys-16 with the small, uncharged methyl moiety demonstrates that this active-site residue is not essential for catalysis."

The two enzymes behaved in a similar manner on gel filtration (apparent Mr = 280,000), DE52 ion exchange chromatography, and concanavalin A-affinity chromatography and were indistinguishable enzymatically and immunologically. Immunoblots of the Hep G2 and plasma carboxypeptidase N before and following deglycosylation with peptide-N4-[N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl]asparagine amidase F revealed a similar, if not identical, multimeric structure.

Synthesis on plasmid templates containing the wild-type origin of replication was stimulated 1.3-fold by addition of the dnaA-overproducing extract. A larger effect was observed after deletion of the primosome assembly site, the n' site, on the leading strand. On the latter template, synthesis was only about one-half that observed with the wild-type templates, but synthesis could be restored to normal levels by addition of the dnaA-overproducing fractions. When the n' site on the lagging strand of pBR322 was deleted, synthesis in the in vitro replication system was reduced to less than 10% of levels seen with intact templates. dnaA-overproducing extract did not restore activity since the dnaA site was also deleted on these plasmids. To verify that the observed stimulation of wild-type and leading strand n' site mutants was due to the dnaA protein, dnaA protein was purified to greater than 50% homogeneity, and antiserum was prepared. The purified protein stimulated synthesis on the plasmid templates to the same extent as the overproducing extracts, and dnaA antiserum blocked stimulation both by extracts and by the purified protein. Thus, dnaA protein, and, by inference, the dnaA recognition site at the ColE1 origin of replication seem to be important for ColE1 replication. The effect of dnaA protein is enhanced when the n'site is defective, suggesting that the dnaA protein plays a role similar to that of the proteins i, n, n', and n'' in directing primosome assembly, as proposed by Seufert, W., and Messer, W. ((1987) Cell 48, 73-78)."
https://openalex.org/W2007341906,"An iodinated photosensitive derivative of norepinephine, N-(p-azido-m-iodophenethylamidoisobutyl)-norepinephrine (NAIN), has been synthesized and characterized. NAIN stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in guinea pig lung membranes in a manner similar to (-)-isoproterenol and was inhibited by (-)-alprenolol. NAIN was shown to compete with [125I]iodocyanobenzylpindolol for the beta-adrenergic receptor in guinea pig lung membranes with an affinity which was dependent on the presence of guanyl nucleotides. Carrier-free radioiodinated NAIN ([125I]NAIN) was used at 2 nM to photoaffinity label the beta-adrenergic receptor in guinea pig lung membranes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of (-)-alprenolol (1 microM) protectable [125I]NAIN labeling showed the same molecular mass polypeptide (65 kDa) that was specifically derivatized with the antagonist photolabel [125I]iodoazidobenzylpindolol. Specific labeling of the beta-adrenergic receptor with [125I]NAIN was dependent on the presence of MgCl2 and the absence of guanyl nucleotide. Guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate (100 microM) abolished specific labeling by [125I]NAIN. N-Ethylmaleimide (2 mM) in the presence of [125I]NAIN protected against the magnesium and guanyl nucleotide effect. These data show that NAIN is an agonist photolabel for the beta-adrenergic receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1546931526,"The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor is usually anchored to the plasma membrane through a membrane-spanning hydrophobic amino acid sequence that splits the molecule into two approximately equal pieces, an amino-terminal external domain that contains the binding site for PDGF and a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain that includes the tyrosine kinase coding sequences. Here we report the expression of a truncated PDGF receptor that consists of the extracellular domain without the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Unexpectedly, this form of the receptor that lacks a hydrophobic membrane-anchoring sequence was bound to the membrane and was not secreted into the culture media. Conventional methods to dissociate noncovalent protein-protein interactions failed to release the protein from the membrane. When the transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequences were artificially deleted from the PDGF receptor, the truncated extracellular domain was anchored to the membrane through phospholipids and could be released by phospholipase C treatment. This truncated form of the receptor bound PDGF with an affinity 5-20-fold lower than the full-length receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1654915527,"The generation of Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that express assembly defective forms of beta-tubulin were isolated using selections based on reversion of conditional lethal or drug resistance phenotypes. Two such cell lines, D2 and 6H3, were chosen for further characterization because they contain beta-tubulin polypeptides that exhibit decreases in apparent molecular weight on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Analysis of the nucleic acid from these cell lines using both Southern and Northern procedures suggests a deletion in one of the beta-tubulin genes in each cell line. Localization of the missing sequence in D2 was first determined by tryptic peptide mapping by high performance liquid chromatography. Subsequently, the assignment was confirmed by constructing appropriate subclones of a wild type Chinese hamster ovary beta-tubulin cDNA for Southern analysis to demonstrate a failure to recognize characteristic hybridization patterns of the mutant tubulin gene. In the other revertant, 6H3, the deletion was detected on a Northern blot by differential hybridization of a 3' fragment of the cDNA to the beta-tubulin messages. The results indicate that D2 has an internal deletion whose approximate limits extend from amino acid residues 250 through 345. Cell line 6H3 has a deletion that begins near amino acid residue 330 and extends into the 3'-untranslated region of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W2165469217,"Mossbauer spectra of 57Fe-enriched NADH-reduced yeast cytochrome c oxidase reveal two quadrupole doublets of unequal intensity; one (approximately 33%) is typical of high-spin ferrous heme with histidine coordination and is assigned to heme a3, while the other (approximately 67%) is typical of low-spin heme with two nitrogeneous axial ligands as expected from heme a. The excess intensity (approximately 17%) of the low-spin doublet must therefore be assigned to heme a3 in a modified environment. The Mossbauer spectra of the same sample exposed to CO show that 50% of the heme iron forms a CO adduct, consistent with heme a3 being inhibited by CO. While low-spin hem a has the same Mossbauer parameters as in the reduced sample, its intensity has dropped to 35%. A distinctly new high-spin species (approximately 15%) is observed and assigned to heme a in a modified environment. The comparable size of the unexpected high-spin heme a fraction in the CO adduct and the low-spin heme a3 fraction in the reduced enzyme suggest that they arise from the same material. This material is likely to be the inactive fraction that has been found in all preparations of resting yeast cytochrome c oxidase (Siedow, J.N., Miller, S., and Palmer, G. (1981) J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 14, 171-179). The kinetics of CO recombination following photolysis of the CO complex further confirms the coexistence of two distinct fractions associated with active and inactive protein. The majority (approximately 74%), presumably active protein, recombines exponentially from 160 to 270 K following an Arrhenius law. The large activation enthalpy, delta H approximately 35 kJ/mol, is comparable to that found in the beef heart enzyme, suggesting that the flashed-off CO is bound by the nearby CuB as in the mammalian system (Fiamingo, F.G., Altschuld, R.A., Moh, P.P., and Alben, J.O. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 1639-1650). In the minority, presumably inactive, fraction the CO recombination has fast nonexponential kinetics with a distribution of activation enthalpies peaking near delta Hp = 13 kJ/mol reminiscent of CO binding to myoglobin. In this inactive fraction CuB is apparently not accessible to the flashed-off CO."
https://openalex.org/W1581318631,"Phosphoglycerate mutase (GPM) functions reversibly in the glycolytic pathway. Mutations altering the reversibility of GPM have been obtained in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. While wild-type cells grow on glycolytic (glucose) or gluconeogenic (ethanol) substrates, cells with altered GPMs fall into three categories based on their phenotypes 1) glucose- ethanol-, 2) glucose+ ethanol-, and 3) glucose- ethanol+. Cells with the first two phenotypes possessed GPMs that functioned irreversibly in the glycolytic direction. Cells that were glucose- ethanol+ possessed an enzyme that functioned reversibly. All of the altered GPMs had maximal velocities that were less than 3% of the wild-type level. The properties of the altered GPMs studied here provide a rationale for the occurrence in the glycolytic pathway of several glycolytic enzymes such as GPM, which function at high velocities in relation to the much smaller metabolic flux that they support. The altered GPMs were purified and estimates of their kinetic constants obtained. Free energy profiles were drawn for catalysis by the wild type and a mutant GPM that functioned irreversibly. The mutant enzyme was very inefficient. It was shown that an enzyme that functions irreversibly at a reaction with a Keq value close to 1 would necessarily be inefficient while it could evolve to be efficient when catalyzing a reaction that has a Keq value much greater than 1. In the glycolytic path this could be the reason for the characteristic presence of enzymes that function irreversibly at reactions with large Keq values."
