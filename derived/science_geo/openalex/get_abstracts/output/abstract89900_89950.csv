https://openalex.org/W1563253655,"Rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum was fractionated into a and fraction by differential and sucrose gradient centrifugation. External Ca2+ (2-20 microM) caused the release of 40 nmol of 45Ca2+/mg of protein/s from Ca2+-release vesicles passively loaded at pH 6.8 with an internal half-saturation Ca2+ concentration of 10-20 mM. Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release had an approximate pK value of 6.6 and was half-maximally inhibited at an external Ca2+ concentration of 2 X 10(-4) M and Mg2+ concentration of 7 X 10(-5) M. 45Ca2+ efflux from control vesicles was slightly inhibited at external Ca2+ concentrations that stimulated the rapid release of Ca2+ from Ca2+-release vesicles. Adenine, adenosine, and derived nucleotides caused stimulation of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in media containing a physiological free Mg2+ concentration of 0.6 mM. At a concentration of 1 mM, the order of effectiveness was AMP-PCP greater than cAMP approximately AMP approximately ADP greater than adenine greater than adenosine. Other nucleoside triphosphates and caffeine were minimally effective in increasing 45Ca2+ efflux from passively loaded Ca2+-release vesicles. La3+, ruthenium red, and procaine inhibited Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Ca2+ flux studies with actively loaded vesicles also indicated that a subpopulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles contains a Ca2+ permeation system that is activated by adenine nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1605429420,"We have isolated a soluble 35-kDa protein from A-431 cells that in the presence of calcium can serve as a substrate for the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor/kinase. The purification procedure exploits the reversible, Ca2+-dependent binding of the 35-kDa protein to the A-431 total particulate fraction. The 35-kDa protein was purified by 1) Ca2+-dependent adsorption to A-431 particulate fractions, 2) release by chelation of Ca2+ with ethyleneglycolbis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, and 3) chromatography on Sephadex G-100, DEAE-cellulose, and CM-cellulose columns. When a plasma membrane preparation from A-431 cells is used as a source of the EGF-receptor/kinase, the phosphorylation of the 35-kDa protein occurs on tyrosine, is greatly enhanced in the presence of EGF, and occurs only when Ca2+ is added to the standard reaction mixture for phosphorylation. Autophosphorylation of the receptor does not require Ca2+. We have postulated that one of the roles of Ca2+ is to facilitate the interaction of the 35-kDa protein with cellular membranes. Ca2+ enhances, but apparently is not essential for, the direct phosphorylation of the 35-kDa protein by the Triton X-100-solubilized, purified EGF-receptor/kinase. Incubation of intact A-431 cells with EGF at 37 degrees C (but not 0 degrees C) enhances the ability of the particulate fraction prepared from these cells to bind and/or phosphorylate the 35-kDa protein. We suggest that this enhancement in the phosphorylation of the 35-kDa protein, a presumed physiological substrate, is associated with the clustering and internalization of the EGF receptor/kinase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1617139585,"Accurate transcription by RNA polymerase II has been shown to require multiple factors in addition to the purified polymerase. In this study, we use a reconstituted transcription system, consisting of purified RNA polymerase II and three essential HeLa cell chromatographic fractions, to study events leading to transcription from the adenovirus major late promoter. A preincubation-pulse-chase protocol resolves the reaction into events occurring before and after nucleotide addition. Preincubation of template with a mixture of RNA polymerase II and factors allows formation of complexes, which are defined by the ability to rapidly commence accurate transcription when presented nucleotides. Maximal activation requires that polymerase, template, and each of the three HeLa fractions be present during preincubation. The activated complexes are template associated, as shown by their inability to exchange onto a second template added during further preincubation. Similar protocols are used to define functional intermediates leading to the activated complex. A template-associated functional complex is formed during the preincubation of template with just two of the HeLa fractions. Polymerase can associate with this intermediate complex in the absence of the third HeLa fraction. In the accompanying paper, we describe a direct analysis of initiation by complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1535606309,"Heparan sulfate (HS), a prominent component of vascular endothelial basal lamina, is cleaved into large Mr fragments and solubilized from subendothelial basal lamina-like matrix by metastatic murine B16 melanoma cells. We have examined the degradation products of HS and other purified glycosaminoglycans produced by B16 cells. Glycosaminoglycans 3H-labeled at their reducing termini or metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate were incubated with B16 cell extracts in the absence or presence of D-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone, a potent exo-beta-glucuronidase inhibitor, and glycosaminoglycan fragments were analyzed by high speed gel permeation chromatography. HS isolated from bovine lung, Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma, and subendothelial matrix were degraded into fragments of characteristic Mr, in contrast to hyaluronic acid, chondroitin 6-sulfate, chondroitin 4-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and heparin which were essentially undegraded. Heparin, but not other glycosaminoglycans, inhibited HS degradation. The time dependence of HS degradation into particular Mr fragments indicated that HS was cleaved at specific intrachain sites. In order to determine specific HS cleavage points, HS prereduced with NaBH4 was incubated with a B16 cell extract and HS fragments were separated. The newly formed reducing termini of HS fragments were then reduced with NaB[3H]4, and the fragments hydrolyzed to monosaccharides by trifluoroacetic acid treatment and nitrous acid deamination. Since 3H-reduced terminal monosaccharides from HS fragments were overwhelmingly (greater than 90%) L-gulonic acid, the HS-degrading enzyme responsible is an endoglucuronidase (heparanase)."
https://openalex.org/W1700388615,"Abstract We have examined the synthesis and processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides from Aedes albopictus C6/36 mosquito cells. These cells synthesized a glucose-containing lipid-linked oligosaccharide with properties identical to that of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. Results of brief pulse label experiments with [3H]mannose were consistent with the transfer of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to protein followed by the rapid removal of glucose residues. Pulse-chase experiments established that further processing of oligosaccharides in C6/36 cells resulted in the removal of up to six alpha-linked mannose residues yielding Man3GlcNAc2 whose structure is identical to that of the trimannosyl core of N-linked oligosaccharides of vertebrate cells and yeast. Complex-type oligosaccharides were not observed in C6/36 cells. When Sindbis virus was grown in mosquito cells, Man3GlcNAc2 glycans were preferentially located at the two glycosylation sites which were previously shown to have complex glycans in virus grown in vertebrate cells. These Man3GlcNAc2 structures are the most extensively processed oligosaccharides in A. albopictus, and as such, are analogous to the complex glycans of vertebrate cells. We suggest that determinants of oligosaccharide processing which reside in the polypeptide are universally recognized despite evolutionary divergence of the oligosaccharide-processing pathway between insects and vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1486467708,"A variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei was purified following the direct solubilization of trypanosomes in a boiling detergent solution. This material behaved as the amphiphilic membrane form of the glycoprotein previously described (Cardoso de Almeida, M. L., and Turner, M. J. (1983) Nature (Lond.) 302, 349-352). Analysis of this material showed that it contained ester-linked tetradecanoic (myristic) acid. After biosynthetic labeling of trypanosomes with [3H]myristic acid, it was shown that the release of the VSG coat from the parasite membrane, as the soluble form of the VSG, occurred concomitantly with the loss of myristic acid from the glycoprotein. The results suggest that VSG is attached to the parasite membrane via a covalently linked myristic acid-containing lipid moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1489479425,"The intracellular ribose 5-phosphate concentration was found to be an important determinant of rates of de novo purine synthesis. When ribose 5-phosphate production was reduced in cultured human lymphoblasts by glucose starvation, the intracellular phosphoribosylpyrophosphate concentration and rates of de novo purine synthesis decreased. Inosinate-guanylate:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (HPR transferase)-deficient cells were relatively more resistant to glucose starvation. To minimize the effect of purine nucleotide feedback inhibition on the de novo pathway, cells were treated with inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase and adenylosuccinate synthetase. In normal lymphoblasts, purine synthesis was stimulated only at glucose concentrations greater than 100 microM while in HPR transferase-deficient lymphoblasts, stimulation occurred even in the absence of glucose. The differences between the normal and HPR transferase-deficient cells were lost when ribose reutilization from endogenous nucleotide breakdown was impaired in the HPR transferase-deficient cells by incubation with 2'-deoxyinosine. Endogenous ribose reutilization for purine synthesis is, therefore, important when either glucose availability is limited or synthesis is stimulated. In the absence of glucose, exogenous purine nucleotides restored the intracellular concentrations of ribose 5-phosphate, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate, and purine nucleotides to almost 100% and rates of purine synthesis to 50-75% of those at 10 mM glucose. When ribose 5-phosphate production was increased in peripheral blood lymphocytes by phytohemagglutinin activation, the intracellular phosphoribosylpyrophosphate concentration and rates of de novo purine synthesis increased."
https://openalex.org/W1508947443,"We have studied the development of high affinity insulin receptors and insulin-stimulated responses in the differentiating nonfusing muscle cell line BC3H-1. In the logarithmic growth phase, these myoblasts exhibit very low levels of insulin binding and no detectable insulin-stimulated glucose or amino acid uptake. Following the cessation of cell division and subsequent spontaneous differentiation, the resulting myocytes develop a 5-fold increase in specific 125I-insulin binding and demonstrate physiologic insulin-stimulated glucose and amino acid uptake (100% increase above baseline) with half-maximum stimulation at 1-3 nM in agreement with the known in vivo and in vitro insulin sensitivity of muscle tissue. Insulin stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake is detectable within 3 min, becomes maximal within 15 min, and is mediated by a rapid increase of plasma membrane transport units, as determined by D-glucose-inhibitable cytochalasin B binding, resulting in a 2-fold increase in the Vmax for 2-deoxyglucose transport with no change in Km. Myocyte insulin binding is specific, reversible, and saturable, yielding equilibrium within 18 h at 4 degrees C. Scatchard analysis identified the high affinity insulin receptor with a Kd of 0.5 nM at 4 degrees C. The myocytes also demonstrate sensitive down-regulation of cell surface insulin receptors, with a maximum decrease of 50% in cell surface insulin binding following exposure to 20 nM insulin for 18 h at 37 degrees C. Since the differentiation of this muscle cell line from myoblasts to nonfusing myocytes is accompanied by the development of high affinity insulin receptors and physiologic insulin-stimulated glucose and alpha-methylaminoisobutyric acid uptake, this continuously cultured system provides an excellent model for the study of differentiation and mechanism of insulin action in muscle, its quantitatively most significant target tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1508045395,"Rat liver ribosomes and 40 S ribosomal subunits were phosphorylated with the purified catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 plateaued at around 2 mol of phosphate/mol of protein with both substrates. Peptide map analyses showed that the most prominent phosphorylation sites associated with 40 S substrates were the adjacent serines in the Arg-Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Arg segment of S6. The first serine residue appeared to be the preferred site as has been established previously for 80 S ribosomes (Wettenhall, R.E.H., and Cohen, P. (1982) FEBS Lett. 140, 263-269). Additional phosphorylation sites were apparent from the peptide maps. One of these was associated with the triphosphopeptide (termed T1a) having the sequence Arg-Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Arg-Ala-Ser-Thr-Ser-Lys. A larger fragment of S6 (termed Tlc) isolated from mild tryptic digests of whole ribosomes, consisted of the T1a sequence extended by the sequence Ser-Glu-Glu-Ser-Gln-(Lys) at the COOH terminus. A comparison of the size and chromatographic and isoelectric focusing properties of the T1a/T1c peptides and prominent tryptic peptides of S6 from insulin-stimulated hepatocytes indicated a relationship between these peptides. Thus, it appeared that some of the potential phosphorylation sites in the T1a/T1c region of S6 are phosphorylated by an insulin-regulated kinase in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1594305728,"The structural features of native and deglycosylated ovine submaxillary mucin (OSM) were determined by electron microscopy of platinum unidirectionally shadowed preparations and by ultracentrifugation. Thin filamentous molecules, of which 90% were 100-230 nm in length with estimated diameters of 1.0-1.4 nm, were observed with dilute samples of OSM in high ionic strength solvents (5-30 micrograms/ml in 0.8 M NaCl or NH4Ac). Ultracentrifugation studies indicated that these filamentous structures were monomers and/or dimers. At higher mucin concentrations or in lower ionic strength solvents, OSM molecules were oligomers that appeared as long rope-like strands. Removal of sialic acid residues by incubation with Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase yielded filamentous structures similar to those observed with OSM and some smaller less extended structures. Subsequent removal of the GalNAc residues of asialo-OSM with C. perfringens alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase resulted in a dramatic change in appearance, from an extended filament to a globular form. The frictional ratios of OSM and deglycosylated OSM were consistent with the marked structural differences of these molecules. Native OSM had a frictional ratio of 3.09, comparable to that of highly asymmetric tropomyosin (3.22); deglycosylated OSM had a frictional ratio of 1.11, comparable to that of globular ovalbumin (1.08)."
https://openalex.org/W1536001384,"MM creatine kinase purified from tissue exists as a single form but upon release into the plasma exhibits three forms which, based on increasing anodal migration on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, are referred to as MM1, MM2, and MM3. The three forms were isolated in pure form from plasma in sufficient quantities for biochemical and physiological studies. Chromatofocusing results show that MM1, MM2, and MM3 have distinct isoelectric points of 7.58, 7.43, and 7.30, respectively. Analysis on high pressure liquid chromatography showed MM1 and tissue creatine kinase (MMt) to have identical peptide maps, but MM2 and MM3 were different in at least one amino acid. Tissue MM creatine kinase was converted in vitro to MM2 and MM3 after incubation in plasma. Conversion was unaffected by nonspecific proteases but inhibited by benzoylarginine, epsilon-amino caproic acid, and guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, specific inhibitors of carboxypeptidase N. Digestion of purified tissue MM creatine kinase with carboxypeptidases N and B produced MM2 and MM3 which were identical with the forms produced in vivo. Hybridization experiments with MM1 plus MM3 produced all three forms, as did tissue MM creatine kinase plus MM2. MM2 was also able to produce all three forms in the experiments. The plasma half-life of tissue MM creatine kinase or MM1 was shown to be about one-half that of MM3. The results suggest that hydrolytic cleavage of a basic amino acid, presumably by carboxypeptidase N, is responsible for conversion of MMt to MM2 and MM3. COOH-terminal amino acid analysis demonstrated the COOH-terminal amino acid of canine and rabbit MM1 to be lysine. Thus, we conclude that cleavage of the COOH-terminal lysine from MMt by serum carboxypeptidase N generates two additional MM creatine kinase isoforms with prolonged plasma clearance rates."
https://openalex.org/W1541332557,"The unactivated, molybdate-stabilized rat hepatic glucocorticoid receptor has been purified approximately 4000-fold, as calculated by specific radioactivity, by affinity chromatography using a deoxycorticosterone-derivatized agarose, gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-1.5m agarose, and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The final receptor sediments at 9-10 S in low salt (40 mM KCl) glycerol gradients containing molybdate. Elevated salt concentrations up to 1 M KCl reduce the sedimentation coefficient to 8-9 S. The final DEAE-cellulose eluted complexes exhibit a Stokes radius of 7.3 nm, a value similar to that reported for receptors in crude cytosol. From the hydrodynamic parameters an apparent Mr = 303,000 can be calculated for the steroid-receptor complex. Analysis of the receptor-containing fractions from DEAE-cellulose chromatography by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrates the occurrence of a major Mr = 90,000 protein band which closely followed the distribution of bound radioactivity. Two other proteins corresponding to Mr = 41,000 and 40,000 also exhibit the same distribution pattern. Saturation of cytosolic specific binding sites with unlabeled triamcinolone acetonide prior to receptor purification results in the disappearance of these three proteins from the DEAE-cellulose chromatogram. Furthermore, a Mr = 24,000 component, which is eluted from DEAE-cellulose at a salt concentration higher than that of the bound radioactivity peak itself, also disappears. These observations argue that the Mr = 90,000, 41,000, 40,000, and 24,000 components are related as components or degradation products of the unactivated, molybdate-stabilized rat hepatic glucocorticoid-receptor complex. Studies on the in vitro activation of purified steroid-receptor complexes have revealed that Sephadex G-25 gel filtration and warming (25 degrees C for 30 min) enables purified receptors to become activated judged by ability to bind to DNA-cellulose but to a lower extent than observed for receptors in crude tissue homogenates. A DNA-cellulose binding capacity, similar to that shown by crude liver cytosolic receptor under the same conditions, can be conferred on the purified complexes only in a reconstituted system in which crude cytosol has been added. Molybdate is shown to completely inhibit activation induced by gel-filtration and offers significant protection against heat-induced activation both in highly purified and reconstituted systems. The activation inhibitory effect of molybdate has also been confirmed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1506301057,"An isoactin analysis was performed on L-[35S]cysteine labeled BC3H1 cells to determine if these smooth muscle-like cells synthesize vascular smooth muscle actin. Three different NH2-terminal peptides were identified on thin layer electrophoretograms of DNase I-purified and trypsin-digested BC3H1 cell actin. Results obtained from secondary digestion with thermolysin or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease showed that the most acidic NH2-terminal peptide was derived from vascular smooth muscle alpha-isoactin. Treatment of cell monolayers with serum-free medium caused a 3-fold increase in the level of alpha-isoactin expression and a concomitant decrease in the level of non-muscle beta- and gamma-isoactin. Cell-cell contact was required for induction of alpha-isoactin, and the effects of serum depletion on isoactin expression and cell growth were reversible. The intensity of about 11 out of 500 polypeptide spots on two-dimensional gels of BC3H1 cell polypeptides also was influenced by the culture conditions. The finding that smooth muscle isoactin expression was coupled to cell growth conditions indicate the potential usefulness of BC3H1 cells in studies of isoactin expression and utilization during vascular smooth muscle development."
https://openalex.org/W1481766523,"The secondary structure of antithrombin III was investigated using the predictive scheme based on the amino acid sequence (Fasman, G. D., Chou, P. Y., and Adler, A. J. (1976) Biophys. J. 16, 1201-1238. The relative composition of the conformational regions is: 31% alpha-helix, 16% beta-sheet, 9% beta-turns, and the rest of the molecule in unordered conformation. When the alpha-helical regions are carefully delineated, 44% are predicted to be unstable helices because of unfavorable electrostatic interactions. Circular dichroism studies showed that the disruption of the first unfolding domain in antithrombin III by low concentration of guanidinium chloride (Villanueva, G. B., and Allen, N. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14048-14053) was accompanied by a 42% decrease in the alpha-helical content. This suggested that the first unfolding domain demonstrated to be essential for heparin binding (Villanueva, G. B., and Allen, N. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11010-11013) corresponds to the predicted unstable helical region. Model-binding studies of the unstable helical segment which contain tryptophan and lysine residues reveal that Lys-282, Lys-286, and Lys-289 are aligned on the same side of the alpha-helix. A model of the antithrombin III-binding octasaccharide (Lindahl, U., Backstrom, G., Thunberg, L., and Leder, I. G. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 6551-6555) was also constructed based on available NMR and x-ray data of the repeating units in heparin. These two models can be positioned such that the three lysine residues in the alpha-helix can be matched for maximal interaction with the three sulfate groups in the octasaccharide demonstrated as essential for binding antithrombin III. Based on these models, it is proposed that the unstable helical segment composed of residues 281-292 is the heparin-binding site in antithrombin III."
https://openalex.org/W1493176169,"Substitution of deuterium for hydrogen on the alpha-carbon of 7-ethoxycoumarin results in an intrinsic isotope effect of approximately 14 during the cytochrome P-448-catalyzed O-deethylation of this substrate (G. T. Miwa, J. S. Walsh, and A. Y. H. Lu (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3000-3004). This dramatic decrease in the C-H bond cleavage rate does not, however, alter the rate of 7-ethoxycoumarin disappearance or the rates of NADPH and oxygen consumption indicating that the catalytic turnover of this enzyme is unaffected. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide formation and the concentrations of an oxycytochrome P-448 complex (lambda max = 440 nm) are also unchanged demonstrating that the steady state concentrations of various oxy intermediates of cytochrome P-448 are also unchanged. An inescapable conclusion from these data is that an irreversible step exists between the formation of these intermediates and the oxidation of the substrate. These data are in agreement with the view that an irreversible cleavage of the dioxygen bond precedes substrate oxidation. Moreover, the oxidatively competent form of the cytochrome must then be committed to substrate oxidation. The latter conclusion is substantiated from high performance liquid chromatography studies which demonstrate the formation of a second metabolite, 6-hydroxy-7-ethoxycoumarin, from the deuterated substrate arising from the metabolic switching away from the O-ethyl group to the aromatic ring of this substrate."
https://openalex.org/W192971,"It has been shown previously in this laboratory that in vitro infection of mouse bone marrow cells with the anemia strain of Friend leukemia virus leads to growth of large bursts of erythroid cells which are arrested in development prior to hemoglobin synthesis but can respond to erythropoietin (EP) to complete the late stage of erythroblast differentiation. In this study, the effect of EP on the metabolism of 45Ca2+ in these cells was examined. At 4 degrees C, an increased rate of 45Ca2+ uptake and efflux as well as an increase in the steady state level of 45Ca2+ in treated cells was observed. Exchange of 45Ca2+ from preloaded cells at 4 degrees C indicated that treatment with EP increased the size of a rapidly exchanging pool of 45Ca2+ from 5 to 12% of total 45Ca2+ in the cell. The effect of treatment with EP can be seen as increased exchange of extracellular 45Ca2+ with cellular Ca2+; however, an effect of EP on the net level of Ca2+ in these cells cannot be excluded. This investigation demonstrates one of the earliest effects of EP on erythroid cells and suggests that alterations in Ca2+ metabolism may contribute to the progression of erythroid cells to their final development."
https://openalex.org/W1571502414,"From a highly myogenic permanent line of rat skel-myoblasts (L6), we have isolated two classes of single step concanavalin A-resistant mutants. The RI class is about 2-fold and RII about 5-fold more resistant than the parental cells to the lethal action of concanavalin A. In all of the mutants, both the morphological differentiation (i.e. fusion to form myotubes) and biochemical differentiation, measured by the appearance of creatine kinase and acetylcholine receptors, are absent. The biochemical lesion in the RI type of mutants is not known, but RII type of mutants is unable to catalyze transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose into a lipid-linked form. Concanavalin A binding to separated membrane proteins from RII type of mutants on polyacrylamide gels is reduced 80% compared to wild type cells. In the RI type of mutants, however, only one major band, approximately 46,000 daltons, does not bind concanavalin A to the same extent as the wild type cells. In somatic cell hybridizations, RI type of mutants complements the RII type. In the hybrids, fusion as well as creatine kinase and acetylcholine receptors reappear, although not to the same extent as in the wild type cells. The 46,000-dalton band also reappears in the complementing hybrids. Thus, this protein may play some crucial role in myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1588488298,"An enzyme responsible for the carbon-sulfur bond cleavage of various S-aryl, S-aralkyl, and S-alkyl cysteines has been purified about 270-fold from Fusobacterium varium. Incubation of a cysteine conjugate of p-bromobenzene with the enzyme yielded equimolar amounts of p-bromobenzenethiol, pyruvic acid, and ammonia, indicating that the carbon-sulfur bond cleavage proceeds via an alpha, beta-elimination reaction. The enzyme activity was inhibited either by hydroxylamine or KCN and stabilized by pyridoxal phosphate, which probably acted as cofactor. The broad substrate spectrum of this enzyme suggested an important role of the intestinal microflora in the in vivo formation of methylthio-containing metabolites of various xenobiotics."
https://openalex.org/W1490304590,"The oligonucleotide primers synthesized by a highly purified KB fraction containing DNA primase and DNA polymerase-alpha activities display reproducible alterations of structure and composition in response to dNTPs. These observations are sufficiently explained by a novel model of primase catalysis that defines the primase as a complex enzyme with distinct catalytic properties that are regulated by mechanisms exquisitely sensitive to dNTP concentration. The enzyme performs the template-directed, de novo synthesis of 1 unit of oligoribonucleotide (canonical priming reaction) and then elongates that moiety to a limited extent by several cycles of addition of short tracts of homogeneous oligoribonucleotide or oligodeoxynucleotide. The oligomeric units have modal lengths of approximately 11- to 14- nucleotides that are postulated to reflect the inherent processivity of the catalytic mechanisms. Elongation is accomplished by two catalytic centers, or conformers of a single center, that are synchronously coupled, mutually exclusive, and extremely stringent for respective rNTP and dNTP substrates. Transitions between these two catalytic modes are regulated by dNTPs and demonstrable at dNTP:rNTP concentrations of less than or equal to 10(-4). In the absence of dNTPs, the primase produces a family of oligoribonucleotides, approximately 24- to 36- nucleotides long; at dNTP levels between 0.08 and 0.80 micron, the primase synthesizes mixed oligomers composed of strictly alternating tandem arrays of oligoribo- and oligodeoxynucleotide units; and at dNTP levels greater than or equal to 4.8 micron, the primase becomes stabilized in the deoxy mode after the initial oligoribo leads to oligodeoxy transition and products contain only a single 5' -terminal unit of oligoribonucleotide. The model predicts that the physiologically significant primer for DNA polymerase-alpha is a mixed 5' -oligoribo-3' -oligodeoxynucleotide and the signal which governs the switch from RNA leads to DNA synthesis is intrinsic in the primase mechanism and is generated by ambient dNTPs."
https://openalex.org/W1514223258,"The role of sulfhydryl groups in the activity of the terminal enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, ferrochelatase (protoheme ferrolyase, EC 4.99.1.1), has been examined by using a variety of sulfhydryl group-specific reagents. The enzyme is rapidly inactivated in a pseudo-first order reaction by N-ethylmaleimide and monobromobimane and more slowly by iodoacetamide and bromotrimethylammoniobimane. Reaction with [3H]N-ethylmaleimide indicates that modification of a single sulfhydryl group is sufficient to inactivate bovine ferrochelatase. The enzyme is protected from inactivation by one substrate, ferrous iron, but not by the porphyrin substrate. Mercury and arsenite are reversible inhibitors. The fluorescence of the bound bimane is blue shifted 8 nm from that obtained in aqueous solutions and is sensitive to quenching by iodide."
https://openalex.org/W1525266474,"The halorhodopsin chromoprotein, a retinal-protein complex with an apparent molecular mass of 20 kilo-daltons, exhibits all of the halide-dependent effects found for the chromophore of functional halorhodopsin in cell envelope vesicles. With increasing halide concentration (a) an alkali-dependent 580/410 nm chromophore equilibrium (attributed to reversible deprotonation of the retinal Schiff's base) is shifted toward the 580-nm chromophore and (b) the flash-induced photocycle proceeds increasingly via P520, rather than via P660. The halide-binding site(s) responsible for these effects must reside, therefore, in the chromoprotein. Chloride and bromide are about equivalent, but iodide is much less effective in these effects and in being transported. Several other anions, i.e. thiocyanate, nitrate, phosphate, and acetate, affect the absorption maximum of the chromophore but do not allow the production of P520 upon flash illumination and are not transported. However, these ions appear to compete with chloride in the flash experiments. These observations suggest that binding of anions to a relatively nonspecific site affects the protonation state of the Schiff's base in the chromophore. Either this site directly or a more specific site, connected to the first one by a sequential pathway, is involved with the photocycle intermediates and with chloride transport by halorhodopsin."
https://openalex.org/W2116166859,"The thy- mutator phenotype of Chinese hamster ovary cells is distinguished by increased intracellular levels of dCTP, auxotrophy for thymidine, and elevated spontaneous mutational rates. To determine the biochemical lesion responsible for this complex phenotype, enzymes responsible for the synthesis of dCTP and dTTP were investigated. Levels of ribonucleotide reductase and dCMP deaminase were identical in mutant and wild type strains. In contrast, CTP synthetase activity in extracts from thy- strains was consistently altered in that 50% of enzyme activity was resistant to feedback inhibition by CTP. Additionally, thy- strains obtained by DNA transfection also had CTP-resistant CTP synthetase. Thy+ revertants lost the resistant enzyme, and total activity was reduced. CTP-resistant CTP synthetase was regained in thy- mutants reselected from thy+ revertants, but in these strains all activity was resistant. These experiments demonstrate that the thy- mutator phenotype is a consequence of a mutation of CTP synthetase and suggest that one pathway of reversion to the wild type state is by loss or inactivation of the mutant allele rendering the revertants hemizygous for the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1578424822,"Methoxyflurane is an anesthetic whose metabolism by cytochrome P-450LM2 has been shown to be dependent upon a heat-stable microsomal protein (Canova-Davis, E., and Waskell, L. A. (1982) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 108, 1264-1270). Treatment of this protein with diethylpyrocarbonate, which modifies selected amino acids, caused a dose-dependent loss in its ability to effect the metabolism of methoxyflurane by purified cytochrome P-450LM2. This protein factor has been identified as cytochrome b5 by demonstrating that cytochrome b5 and the heat-stable factor coelute during cytochrome b5 purification. Neither ferriheme nor apocytochrome b5 was able to substitute for the activating factor, while cytochrome b5 reconstituted from apocytochrome b5 and heme exhibited an activity similar to that of native b5. Examination of the cytochrome b5 molecule by computer graphics suggested that diethylpyrocarbonate did not inactivate b5 by reacting with the anionic surface of the cytochrome b5 molecule. Maximal rates of methoxyflurane metabolism were obtained at a ratio of 1:1:1 of the three proteins, cytochrome P-450LM2:reductase:cytochrome b5. In summary, it has been demonstrated that the heat-stable protein, cytochrome b5, is obligatory for the metabolism of methoxyflurane by cytochrome P-450LM2. These data also suggest that cytochrome b5 may be acting as an electron donor to P-450LM2 in the O-demethylation of methoxyflurane."
https://openalex.org/W1602198467,"Rat liver nuclear matrix structures were isolated while preserving the integrity of the nuclear envelope, i.e. in the absence of any detergent extraction. In order to determine the relationships between the nuclear membranes and peripheral lamina, nuclear matrix-envelope preparations were submitted to sodium carbonate extraction (0.1 M, pH 11.5), a solvent which solubilizes both peripheral membrane proteins and membrane-enclosed contents. One-dimensional and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of material insoluble in sodium carbonate confirmed that intrinsic membrane proteins were indeed retained in the membrane structures. Approximately 50 to 60% of the lamin B present in matrix-envelope preparations was found in these insoluble membranes while a smaller amount of lamin A and even less of lamin C resisted complete extraction. The identity of the lamins was confirmed by their migration on two-dimensional gels and by comparison of one-dimensional peptide maps. The same results were obtained using nuclear membranes prepared by a milder heparin procedure. The location of lamin B as an intrinsic membrane protein was also established by photoaffinity labeling with the membrane-penetrating reagent azidopyrene. A small but reproducible amount of labeling occurred as well on lamin A polypeptides. These results support the hypothesis that the peripheral lamina is attached to the nuclear envelope and anchored there via the presence of lamin B molecules within the bilayer of the inner nuclear membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1523861571,"Abstract The progesterone receptors from various stages of estrogen induced oviduct development, estrogen withdrawal, and secondary stimulation with estrogen were examined. The progesterone receptors were characterized for their biological function (i.e. capacity for nuclear translocation, nuclear binding, and effects on RNA polymerase II activity) as well as certain physical properties. The progesterone receptors from the undeveloped or partially developed oviducts (0 to 8 days of estrogen treatment) displayed little or no nuclear translocation and binding in vivo or in vitro. Similarly, progesterone showed little or no effect in vivo on RNA polymerase II activity at the early stages of development. As development progressed from 8 to 12 days of estrogen treatment, the above parameters rapidly increased to maximal levels and plateaued through day 23 of estrogen treatment. A marked decrease in these parameters occurred within 1 day of estrogen withdrawal. The reverse series of events occurred during secondary estrogen stimulation of 10-day-old withdrawn chicks. While the receptor concentrations increased rapidly to maximum values by 2 days of restimulation, receptor function did not return until day 4. Similarly, the effects of progesterone on RNA polymerase II activity reached maximal values by day 4. The progesterone receptor isolated from oviducts during development, estrogen withdrawal, and restimulation, displayed similar patterns of cell-free binding to chromatin and nucleoacidic protein as that observed in vivo supporting the nativeness of the in vitro binding assay. In contrast, the cell-free binding of these same progesterone receptor to pure DNA were not similar to the in vivo binding, i.e. no patterns (differences) in progesterone receptor binding were observed. These data support that protein DNA complexes and not pure DNA represent the native acceptor sites for oviduct progesterone receptor. Comparison of the progesterone receptor between the functional and nonfunctional states revealed no differences in the steroid affinity for the receptor, in the apparent pI of the species, or in the sedimentation of the receptor under high salt conditions. However, the nonfunctional receptors consistently displayed a deficiency in one of the two monomer molecular species (the B species) as determined by isoelectric focusing. These results suggest that both monomer species of progesterone receptor are required for biological activity. Interestingly, the 7S aggregate species of the progesterone receptor was constantly detected even when only one of the monomer species was present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1544675977,"Placental alkaline phosphatase activity was induced in choriocarcinoma cells by sodium butyrate. Butyrate stimulated de novo synthesis of the enzyme and the increase in phosphatase activity could be completely accounted for by the increase in phosphatase protein: the increases in placental alkaline phosphatase immunoactivity and placental alkaline phosphatase biosynthesis as measured by incorporation of the radioactive precursors, L-[35S]methionine, [3H]mannose, and [3H] glucosamine were similar to the increase in phosphatase activity. Sodium butyrate increased the rates of placental alkaline phosphatase biosynthesis but had no effect on the rate of placental alkaline phosphatase degradation or processing. Both control and butyrate-induced cells contained polypeptides of 61,500 and 64,500 apparent molecular weights that were identified as the precursor and fully processed forms of the placental alkaline phosphatase monomer, respectively. Further, processing of the 61,500-dalton polypeptide to the 64,500-dalton polypeptide involved the incorporation of additional glucosamine and N-acetylneuraminic acid moieties. Gel electrophoresis of anti-placental alkaline phosphatase-precipitable polypeptides from an in vitro protein-synthesizing system directed by RNA isolated from control or butyrate-induced cells demonstrated that sodium butyrate induced the synthesis of placental alkaline phosphatase mRNA. Our data indicate that sodium butyrate induces the specific transcription of the placental alkaline phosphatase gene."
https://openalex.org/W1550782230,"Abstract ATP synthesis by starved whole cells of alkalophilic Bacillus firmus RAB was energized by addition of DL-malate or by imposition of a valinomycin-mediated K+ diffusion potential. At pH 9.0, the transmembrane electrical potentials produced by these two means were similar in magnitude, at close to -170 mV. While N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive ATP synthesis occurred upon the addition of DL-malate, no ATP was synthesized in response to a diffusion potential. In contrast, Na+-dependent accumulation of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid was energized equally well by DL-malate or a diffusion potential at pH 9.0. Even at pH 7.0, DL-malate was more efficacious than a diffusion potential in energizing ATP synthesis as assessed by determining the phosphorylation potentials generated at transmembrane electrical potential values of different magnitudes. Both modes of energization did, however, result in N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-sensitive ATP synthesis at pH 7.0. The results of these studies are consistent with a model of energy coupling in which one pathway of protons between the respiratory proton pumps and the H+-translocating ATPase is direct or localized. Whereas an artificially imposed electrochemical gradient of protons can energize ATP synthesis under certain experimental conditions, in the proton-poor milieu that is optimal for growth of alkalophilic bacilli, the direct proton pathway may be crucial."
https://openalex.org/W1592165353,"Existing estimates of the molar content of iron and labile sulfide in aconitase are varying and deviate from integral numbers. The proposed model of the iron-sulfur cluster of inactive aconitase, suggesting it to contain a single [3Fe-4S] cluster, has prompted us to reinvestigate the basic physicochemical data of the enzyme to arrive at a more precise figure of the stoichiometry of Fe and S2-. The molecular weight of aconitase estimated from low speed sedimentation equilibrium was 80,900 +/- 2,200. Gel chromatography in 6 M guanidine HCl showed the presence of a single peptide chain of 710 residues, corresponding to a Mr of 78,400, while gel electrophoresis in presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate gave a value of 83,000. Both values are in reasonable agreement with the value obtained from sedimentation equilibrium. Protein determination by amino acid analyses, together with iron and sulfur analyses of 20 different preparations of greater than or equal to 95% purity, gives values of 2.9 +/- 0.2 Fe/mol and 3.9 +/- 0.2 S2-/mol. The data obtained are thus in agreement with the [3Fe-4S] model of the iron-sulfur cluster of inactive aconitase."

About 6 mg of erythropoietin was isolated from 700 liters of urine and the specific activity was estimated to be 81,600 units/mg of protein with an in vivo 59Fe incorporation assay method, using starved rats. Activity measurement of the extracts from sliced gels after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the Western blotting technique revealed heterogeneity of the isolated erythropoietin, which is probably caused by variable amounts of carbohydrates attached to the polypeptide chain. Thirty amino acids in the NH2-terminal portion of the isolated hormone were sequenced."
https://openalex.org/W1534133194,"The compound N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone contains a substantial apolar region as well as a peptide bond-like moiety. This solvent, therefore, provides a useful model for protein interiors. Under certain conditions of temperature and salt concentration, cyclohexylpyrrolidone forms a two-phase system with water. This permits partition coefficients and subsequent free energies of transfer of amino acid side chains from cyclohexylpyrrolidone to water to be simply determined. Free energies of transfer measured in this manner for 21 amino acids are found to be substantially less than those obtained from the commonly used ethanol/water solubility model. This suggests less of a contribution of hydrophobic interactions to the stabilization of protein structure than is conventionally assumed."
https://openalex.org/W1678224797,"The effects of substrate and cofactors on the phosphorylation of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and on dephosphorylation by phosphoprotein phosphatase have been examined. The presence of the natural cofactor (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin strongly inhibits the activation observed under phosphorylating conditions; in contrast, this activation is enhanced approximately 20 to 50% by phenylalanine. The phosphorylation of the hydroxylase is strongly inhibited (approximately 80%) by (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin, while phosphorylation is modestly stimulated by phenylalanine. High concentrations of phenylalanine (1 mM), however, can substantially reverse the inhibition of phosphorylation by (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin. Neither (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin nor phenylalanine affect the phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide substrate of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The inhibition is specific for (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin; the diastereoisomer (6S)-tetrahydrobiopterin has a much smaller effect, and 6-methyltetrahydropterin and 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin have no effect. Both phenylalanine and (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin inhibit to a small extent the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzed by phosphoprotein phosphatase. Neither phenylalanine nor (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin inhibit the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated histones by phosphoprotein phosphatase. These results suggest that the phosphorylation state, and thus the activation state, of phenylalanine hydroxylase in vivo may be modulated, in part, by the availability of substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1596778384,"Rat uterine nuclei have been reported to contain two types of estrogen binding sites (I and II). Type I is the classical high affinity, low capacity translocatable estrogen receptor, while type II is a lower affinity non-translocatable binding site. Correlation of data on hormonal specificity of induction and inhibition, tissue and cellular localization, and ontogenic appearance for type II binding sites and eosinophils suggested the hypothesis that these binding sites are associated with eosinophils. Although type II sites are reported to be highly correlated with uterine growth, premature growth can be elicited in newborn rats by five daily estradiol injections without the appearance of type II sites. Under these conditions, no eosinophils, as measured by peroxidase activity, are found. However, multiple estradiol injections on postnatal days 6-10 or 10-14 increased the levels of both type II sites and eosinophils. Eosinophils, purified from a peritoneal lavage, were found to contain a low affinity binding site with characteristics similar to type II binding sites. Short term estrogen-treated rat uteri contain only type I nuclear receptor and low levels of eosinophils while long term estrogen-treated rat uteri contain both type I and type II nuclear binding sites as well as approximately 6 X 10(5) eosinophils/uterus. The addition of this number of purified eosinophils to short term treated uteri resulted in saturation curves and Scatchard plots identical to those seen in long term treated uteri. These data indicate that the type II nuclear binding site is transported into the uterus with eosinophils following estrogen treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1581130288,"Abstract The three-dimensional structure of apoplastocyanin from poplar leaves (Populus nigra var. italica) has been determined by x-ray diffraction at 1.8-A resolution. The structure closely resembles that of the holoprotein. In particular, the positions of the copper-binding residues in the apo- and holoproteins differ by only 0.1-0.3 A. This indicates that the irregular geometry of the type 1 copper site is imposed upon the metal atom by the polypeptide moiety. A 180 degrees rotation of one solvent-exposed histidine imidazole ring about C beta-C gamma appears to facilitate access to the copper site. The close structural similarity between apo-, Cu-(II)-, and Cu(I)-plastocyanin was initially demonstrated by means of electron density difference maps. Two series of restrained least squares refinement calculations for apoplastocyanin, originating from different sets of atomic positional parameters, were carried out in parallel. Both refinements converged to the same model which, when fully refined, had a residual R = 0.16. Forty-two water molecules were located during the refinement."
https://openalex.org/W1579911473,"The complete amino acid sequence of the alpha chain of histidine decarboxylase of Lactobacillus 30a has been established by isolation and analysis of the eight methionine-containing tryptic peptides of this chain. These peptides provide the overlaps required to order all nine peptides derived by complete cyanogen bromide cleavage of the alpha chain (Huynh, Q.K., Vaaler, G.L., Recsei, P.A., and Snell, E.E. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2826-2832). Ordering of six of the latter peptides was confirmed by isolation and analysis of four peptides derived by incomplete cyanogen bromide cleavage. The alpha chain is composed of 226 residues and has a molecular weight of 24,892 calculated from the sequence. These results and the previously determined sequence of the beta chain (Vaaler, G.L., Recsei, P.A., Fox, J.L., and Snell, E.E. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12770-12774) establish the complete amino acid sequence of the enzyme and of the pi chain of prohistidine decarboxylase. The latter is composed of 307 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 33,731. Four segments of the pi chain sequence are repeated. The bond between Ser-81 and Ser-82 that is cleaved during proenzyme activation is in an uncharged portion of the sequence that is rich in serine and threonine residues and is predicted to be part of a beta sheet structure."
https://openalex.org/W1543647784,"Exchange of sulfide into the iron-sulfur cluster of beef heart aconitase was investigated using Na235S. After anaerobic incubation for minutes and up to 24 h, samples were freed of substances of low Mr by Sephadex G-50 and analyzed for protein, protein-bound Fe, S2-, total Fe-S cluster by EPR, and for radioactivity. The activated and the inactive enzyme exchange three S2- ions within 1-2 h at essentially equal rates. No further exchange is observed with the activated enzyme within 24 h, whereas with the inactive enzyme, (partial) exchange of one more S2- occurs slowly within 5-10 h. Exchange is facilitated at elevated pH, but then destruction of clusters also increases. During incubation of inactive enzyme with S2-, partial activation may occur because S2- can act as reductant. Thus, depending on conditions, we observed very low to substantial activities. There is a linear, positive correlation between activity developed and ratio of cluster bound Fe to S2-. When Fe and dithiothreitol are present together with S2- during incubation, the extent of S2-exchange generally is between 10 and 25%. Fe incorporation exceeds S2- exchange, with the difference between Fe and S2- incorporation consistently amounting to one Fe/cluster. It is suggested that this excess Fe represents the Fe ion taken up on completion of the [4Fe-4S] from the [3Fe-4S] structure. The ease of S2-exchange suggests that the Fe-S cluster of aconitase is readily accessible to solvent."
https://openalex.org/W1558819501,"Beef heart aconitase has been studied by low temperature magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy in the wavelength region 300 to 1900 nm. Together with parallel electron paramagnetic resonance and activity measurements, these data enable correlations between Fe-S cluster-type and enzymic activity in aconitase. In samples not exposed to extraneous Fe, the Fe-S cluster in aconitase exhibits the characteristic properties of a 3Fe center in both the as isolated and dithionite-reduced states. On the basis of the detailed form of the low temperature MCD spectra, three types of 3Fe center can be distinguished in biological samples. These are typified by the 3Fe centers in aconitase, Desulfovibrio gigas FdII, and Azotobacter crooccocum Fd. In aconitase, maximal enzymic activity is found to be associated with the build-up of [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters in good agreement with the Mossbauer studies of Kent et al. (Kent, T. A., Dreyer, J. L., Kennedy, M. C., Huynh, B. H., Emptage, M. H., Beinert, H., and Munck, E. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 1096-1100). However, significant catalytic activity (approximately 60%) was obtained by reduction of the 3Fe center with dithionite in the absence of added Fe. The form and intensity of the resultant MCD spectrum are consistent with the majority of the Fe being in the form of reduced 3Fe clusters. The possibility that a reduced 3Fe cluster is capable of promoting partial catalytic activity in aconitase is discussed in light of these results."
https://openalex.org/W1541587372,"Halorhodopsin is a light-driven chloride pump in the cell membrane of Halobacterium halobium. Recently, a polypeptide of apparent Mr = 20,000 has been purified that contains the halorhodopsin chromophore. Here we use 35Cl NMR to show that the purified chromoprotein possesses two previously unknown classes of chloride-binding sites. One class exhibits a low affinity (KD much greater than 1 M) for chloride and bromide. The second class exhibits a higher affinity (KD = 110 ± 50 mM) for chloride and also binds other anions according to the affinity series I-, SCN- greater than Br-, NO-3 greater than Cl- greater than F- , citrate. Both classes of NMR site remain intact at pH 11, indicating that the essential positive charges are provided by arginine. Also, both classes are unaffected by bleaching, suggesting that the sites are not in the immediate vicinity of the halorhodopsin chromophore. Although the chromoprotein also appears to contain the chloride- transport site (Steiner, M., Oesterhelt, D., Ariki, M., and Lanyi, J. K. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2179-2184), this site was not detected by 35Cl NMR, suggesting that the transport site is in the interior of the protein where it is sampled slowly by chloride in the medium. It is proposed that the purified chromoprotein possesses a channel leading from the medium to the transport site and that the channel contains the high affinity NMR site which facilitates the migration of chloride between the medium and the transport site. 

We have also used 35Cl NMR to study chloride binding to purified monomeric bacteriorhodopsin; however, this protein contains no detectable chloride-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1555403659,"Human and bovine parathyroid gland slices were incubated in vitro for varying time periods with inorganic 32P and [35S]methionine or [3H]serine. Tissue was then extracted with aqueous medium, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) purified. Incorporated 32P was found to coelute with immunoreactive PTH in multiple chromatographic systems, and a peak of phosphorylated material could be resolved from the nonphosphorylated hormone by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The amino acid composition of both the phosphorylated and the nonphosphorylated entities conformed to that of the major glandular species of PTH, and phosphorylated hormone accounted for 10-20% of the total. A time course revealed slow incorporation of 32P into hormone, and after a 4-h preincubation with inorganic 32P, co-elution of 32P with both PTH and its precursor was observed. Phosphoserine was identified in purified PTH labeled with [3H]serine. Additionally dilute acid hydrolysis of PTH, labeled with [35S]methionine and containing 32P, generated an 35S-labeled fragment with which 32P co-chromatographed. The results are consistent with in vitro phosphorylation of PTH on serine residues within the NH2-terminal region of the hormone by both human and bovine glands and suggest that phosphorylation of the prohormone occurs as well."

https://openalex.org/W1563561776,"We have examined the biosynthesis of rat apolipoprotein C-III in the small intestine and liver. The primary translation product of its mRNA was recovered from wheat germ and ascites cell-free systems. Comparison of its NH2-terminal sequence with the NH2 terminus of plasma high density lipoprotein-associated apolipoprotein C-III showed that apo-C-III was initially synthesized as a preprotein with a 20 amino acid long NH2-terminal extension: Met-X-X-X-Met-Leu-Leu-X-X-Ala-Leu-X-Ala-Leu-Leu-Ala-X-Ala-X-Ala. Co-translational cleavage of the cell-free translation product by signal peptidase generated a polypeptide with the same NH2 terminus as the mature protein (X-Glu-X-Glu-Gly-Ser-Leu-Leu-Leu-Gly-Ser-Met). Therefore, this apolipoprotein does not undergo post-translational proteolytic processing like two other high density lipoprotein-affiliated proteins, proapo-A-I and proapo-A-II. The mRNA encoding apolipoprotein C-III comprises 0.4% of the translatable RNA species in adult rat liver and 0.14% of the translatable RNA species in small intestinal epithelium. Acute fat feeding with a triglyceride meal resulted in a 2-fold increase in intestinal preapo-C-III mRNA accumulation but no change in the levels of preproapo-A-I mRNA. Thus, the acute response of the apo-A-I and C-III genes to triacylglycerol absorption differs."

Sequential treatment with D-galactose oxidase and tritiated borohydride is a standard method for incorporation of radioactive marker into what has been assumed to be exclusively terminal residues of D-galactose or N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. The data presented here establishes the ability of D-galactose oxidase to act upon a specific subterminal D-galactosyl residue, [----2)-D-Gal(1----], as well as upon terminal nonreducing galactosyl residues. Helix pomatia galactogen, a high molecular weight galactose homopolymer, was sequentially treated with D-galactose oxidase and tritiated borohydride. The 3H-galactogen was recovered and analyzed to determine which galactosyl units carried radioactive label. After complete methylation and then acid hydrolysis of 3H-galactogen, its partially methylated galactosyl components were reduced and acetylated for identification by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Radioactivity was located by collection of effluent fractions during gas chromatography. The only subterminal residue to be labeled was the 2-linked D-galactose, although another with a free oxidizable 6-carbon was present, 3-linked D-galactose, [----3)-D-Gal(1----].

This cleavage reaction is inhibited by 3 mM iodoacetamide. The 170K protein, in turn, is cleaved to yield either of two pairs of proteins, a 110K and 60K pair or a 87K and 84K pair. The reaction for forming the 110K-60K pair is sensitive to dilution, indicating that a free factor is involved. The reaction for forming the 87K-84K pair, on the other hand, is not affected by diluting the lysate reaction mixture with buffer even to 200-fold, indicating that the reaction is autolytic. Formation of the 110K-60K pair, but not the 87K-84K pair, is inhibited by 2 mM zinc chloride.

https://openalex.org/W1479694318,"Mercury (II) forms a covalent, 1:1 complex with NADPH which is indicated by the disappearance of the chromophore at 340 nm. With the use of NMNH as an analogue, the spectral changes were attributed to the reaction of Hg(II) with the nicotinamide ring. This reaction is reversed by the addition of sulfhydryl groups or other metal-chelating agents. The structure of the Hg(II) . NADPH complex was determined with 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and homonuclear decoupling and was shown to have Hg covalently attached to C-5 of the nicotinamide ring. From these results, we propose that Hg(II) reacts with the double bond between C-5 and C-6 to form a mercuronium ion which is opened by the nucleophilic attack of water on C-6. Two conformations of the Hg(II) . NADPH complex were detected, corresponding to the formation of the mercuronium ion on either the a or b side of the nicotinamide ring. Fluorescence quenching studies with the Hg(II) .

In five different fibroblast strains, A1 preparations from the medium and the cells, respectively, contained 36-63% and 59-79% of the sulfated proteoglycans applied to the gradients. A subpopulation of A1 proteoglycans was excluded from Sepharose CL-2B columns under associative conditions (0.5 M guanidium chloride (GdmCl]. The excluded proteoglycans comprised 45-55% of the medium and 28-40% of the cell-associated A1 preparations, showed reversible association-dissociation behaviors on Sepharose CL-2B columns, were composed primarily of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, and behaved as monomers with a Kav of 0.33 following mild reduction and alkylation. These data indicate that the excluded peaks were supramolecular aggregates composed of proteoglycan subunits. The mechanism of aggregate formation was examined in A1D1 and D1 fractions. Hyaluronic acid induced aggregation of medium A1D1 proteoglycans in one cell strain, but not in two others. Aggregation was not observed with hyaluronic acid in any cell-associated A1D1 fraction. D1 medium proteoglycans chromatographed on Sepharose CL-2B columns under associative conditions showed two types of aggregates; one was disrupted with 4 M GdmCl indicating that a portion of the aggregate formed through noncovalent interactions that may not require interaction with hyaluronic acid. A second type of aggregate persisted in 4 M GdmCl and after mild reduction and alkylation of the core protein but was disrupted by 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, suggesting that aggregation had occurred through proteoglycan interaction with lipids or hydrophobic proteins. These data indicate that human skin fibroblasts synthesize proteoglycans which share some of the properties of chondrocyte proteoglycans, but also have distinctive macromolecular characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1597199590,"We have examined the effects of dilution, Ca2+, reduced temperature, and triphosphate depletion on microtubules formed from purified tubulin, heat-treated microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and either GTP, 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine 5'-diphosphate (ddGDP), or 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate (ddGTP). The stability of the polymer formed with tubulin plus ddGTP without MAPs was also examined. In all cases dilution resulted in rapid depolymerization of polymer until a new turbidity plateau was established. These experiments yielded estimates of the critical concentration of tubulin of 0.09 mg/ml with GTP plus MAPs, 0.04 mg/ml with either ddGDP or ddGTP plus MAPs, and 0.07 mg/ml with ddGTP minus MAPs. Addition of CaCl2 to polymer resulted in depolymerization of microtubules formed with either GTP or ddGDP plus MAPs; but both with and without MAPs the polymer formed with ddGTP was stable to Ca2+. The polymer formed with ddGTP minus MAPs was the most cold-labile, major depolymerization occurring at 25 degrees C. With MAPs, microtubules were progressively less cold-labile when formed with GTP, ddGDP, or ddGTP. Depolymerization with GTP was virtually complete at 15 degrees C, with ddGDP at 5 degrees C, and with ddGTP at 0 degrees C. Rapid triphosphate depletion was achieved with phosphofructokinase. GTP-formed tubules were rapidly and completely depolymerized at all GTP concentrations after the enzyme was added to the reaction mixture. Both with and without MAPs polymer formed with ddGTP was progressively more stable upon enzyme addition the higher the initial ddGTP concentration. At specific ddGTP concentrations, however, less depolymerization was observed following enzyme addition if MAPs were present. Microtubules formed with ddGDP plus MAPs were unaffected by phosphofructokinase addition. This comparison of the properties of microtubules formed with MAPs and either ddGDP or ddGTP demonstrates that their stability is enhanced rather than reduced following nucleotide hydrolysis. The greater stability of microtubules formed with ddGTP plus MAPs than of the polymer formed with ddGTP minus MAPs similarly implies substantial enhancement of microtubule stability by the MAPs."
https://openalex.org/W1546247896,"Abstract We have purified an acid-soluble DNA endonuclease, termed nuclease gamma, from Ustilago cell extracts. The enzyme is nearly homogeneous, purified 1700-fold. The protein appears to be globular with a molecular weight in the range 17,000 to 21,000. It requires a divalent cation and is optimally active at slightly alkaline pH. The enzyme prefers duplex DNA as substrate but will slowly cleave single-stranded DNA. Cleavage of covalently closed duplex DNA is unaltered by changes in superhelix density. Divalent cations direct the mode by which the enzyme cleaves duplex DNA. When Mg2+ or Ca2+ is added, the enzyme nicks one strand of the duplex. When Mn2+, Co2+, or Zn2+ is added, the enzyme can introduce double strand breaks. Oligonucleotides terminated with 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl groups are the products of hydrolysis. DNA fragments generated can be religated to linear pBR322 DNA with completely base-paired ends."

Kinetics of the polymerization of Hb AS-fumarate in 1.8 M phosphate buffer showed that Hb AS-fumarate polymerized similarly to Hb S-fumarate despite the presence of a beta A chain. The kinetics of the polymerization of a mixture of Hb AS-fumarate and Hb S-fumarate was similar to that of Hb S-fumarate or Hb AS-fumarate alone. However, when Hb AS-fumarate was mixed with Hb A, the delay time prior to polymerization of the mixture was markedly prolonged. Although the solubility of Hb AS-fumarate was similar to that of Hb S-fumarate, it nearly doubled upon the addition of Hb A. Analysis of Hb A in the polymer phase showed that a significant amount (35-40%) of Hb A copolymerized with Hb AS-fumarate. No such effect was observed when Hb A was mixed with Hb S-fumarate, where the delay time prior to polymerization and the solubility of the mixture were regulated by the concentration of Hb S-fumarate in the mixture. The strong inhibitory effect of Hb A on the polymerization of Hb AS hybrid hemoglobin may help explain the benign clinical course in sickle cell trait."

This three-step irreversible ordered sequence model explains the up- and down-regulation of receptors in terms of the level of insulin concentration. Kinetic expressions were derived for the model. Numerical solutions for these equations, based on data reported by Reed and Lane (Reed, B.C., and Lane, M. D. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 285-289) were used for computer-generated curves illustrating insulin-dependent receptor synthesis and degradation. Results show that this model provides the best fit to the reported data and lend support to the suggestion that the free recycled receptor may differ from the newly synthesized receptor. A possible role for the recycled receptor in signal modulation is suggested."
