For most Dubs, their functions, targets, and regulation are poorly understood. To systematically investigate Dub function, we initiated a global proteomic analysis of Dubs and their associated protein complexes. This was accomplished through the development of a software platform called CompPASS, which uses unbiased metrics to assign confidence measurements to interactions from parallel nonreciprocal proteomic data sets. We identified 774 candidate interacting proteins associated with 75 Dubs. Using Gene Ontology, interactome topology classification, subcellular localization, and functional studies, we link Dubs to diverse processes, including protein turnover, transcription, RNA processing, DNA damage, and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. This work provides the first glimpse into the Dub interaction landscape, places previously unstudied Dubs within putative biological pathways, and identifies previously unknown interactions and protein complexes involved in this increasingly important arm of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway."

In this study, we evaluated the clinical and functional relevance of microRNA-122 (miR-122) expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We report that miR-122 is specifically repressed in a subset of primary tumors that are characterized by poor prognosis. We further show that the loss of miR-122 expression in tumor cells segregates with specific gene expression profiles linked to cancer progression, namely the suppression of hepatic phenotype and the acquisition of invasive properties. We identify liver-enriched transcription factors as central regulatory molecules in the gene networks associated with loss of miR-122, and provide evidence suggesting that miR-122 is under the transcriptional control of HNF1A, HNF3A and HNF3B. We further show that loss of miR-122 results in an increase of cell migration and invasion and that restoration of miR-122 reverses this phenotype. In conclusion, miR-122 is a marker of hepatocyte-specific differentiation and an important determinant in the control of cell migration and invasion. From a clinical point of view, our study emphasizes miR-122 as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for HCC progression."
https://openalex.org/W2008825225,"Obesity and type 2 diabetes are related metabolic disorders of high prevalence. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) was initially characterized as a xenobiotic receptor regulating the responses of mammals to xenotoxicants. In this study, we have uncovered an unexpected role of CAR in preventing obesity and alleviating type 2 diabetes. Using a high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model, we showed that treatment of wild type mice with the CAR agonist 1,4-bis[2-(3,5 dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP) efficiently prevented obesity from happening or reversed preinduced obesity. Treatment with TCPOBOP improved insulin sensitivity in both the HFD-induced type 2 diabetic model and the ob/ob mice. In contrast, CAR null mice maintained on a chow diet showed spontaneous insulin insensitivity, which cannot be relieved by TOPOBOP treatment. The hepatic steatosis in HFD-treated mice and ob/ob mice was markedly reduced by the TCPOBOP treatment. The metabolic benefits of CAR activation may have resulted from the combined effect of inhibition of lipogenesis, very low density lipoprotein secretion and export of triglycerides, and gluconeogenesis as well as increases in brown adipose tissue energy expenditure and peripheral fat mobilization. Moreover, the skeletal muscle of CAR-activated mice showed a decreased incomplete oxidation, despite having a lower expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and its target genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. In summary, our results have revealed an important metabolic function of CAR and may establish this ""xenobiotic receptor"" as a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes."

This protein assembly confers elasticity to all vertebrate elastic tissues including arteries, lung, skin, vocal folds, and elastic cartilage. In this study we examined the mechanism of cell interactions with recombinant human tropoelastin. Cell adhesion to human tropoelastin was divalent cation-dependent, and the inhibitory anti-integrin αVβ3 antibody LM609 inhibited cell spreading on tropoelastin, identifying integrin αVβ3 as the major fibroblast cell surface receptor for human tropoelastin. Cell adhesion was unaffected by lactose and heparin sulfate, indicating that the elastin-binding protein and cell surface glycosaminoglycans are not involved. The C-terminal GRKRK motif of tropoelastin can bind to cells in a divalent cation-dependent manner, identifying this as an integrin binding motif required for cell adhesion.

Cellular interactions with extracellular matrix proteins are vital for cell survival and tissue maintenance. The attachment of cells to their extracellular matrix (ECM) 3The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixEBPelastin-binding proteinHDFhuman dermal fibroblastsBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixEBPelastin-binding proteinHDFhuman dermal fibroblastsBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is often mediated by cell surface integrins. As such, integrins are involved in many biological functions such cell migration and proliferation, tissue organization, wound repair, development, and host immune responses. In addition to roles under normal physiological conditions, integrins are involved in the pathogenesis of diseases such as arthritis, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, microbial and parasitic infection, and cancer. Integrins are a family of heterodimeric transmembrane receptors containing one α subunit and one β subunit (1Green L. Humphries M. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 28: 3-26Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Often integrins bind to ECM proteins via short RGD motifs within the matrix protein (2Newham P. Humphries M.J. Mol. Med. Today. 1996; 2: 304-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition to an RGD motif, fibronectin also contains an upstream PHSRN synergy sequence, which is required for full integrin binding activity (3Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Elastin confers elasticity on all vertebrate elastic tissues including arteries, lung, skin, vocal fold, and elastic cartilage (4Mithieux S.M. Weiss A.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 437-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Elastin comprises ∼90% of the elastic fiber and is intermingled with fibrillin-rich microfibrils (5Ramirez F. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 455-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). There is a single human tropoelastin gene in which alternative splicing can result in the loss of domains 22, 23, 24, 26A, 30, 32, and 33 (4Mithieux S.M. Weiss A.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 437-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Elastin is made from the secreted monomer tropoelastin, which is a 60–72-kDa protein containing repeating hydrophobic and cross-linking domains. Hydrophobic domains are rich in GVGVP, GGVP, and GVGVAP repeats, which can associate by coacervation (6Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This association results in structural changes and increased α-helical content (7Muiznieks L.D. Jensen S.A. Weiss A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 410: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cross-linking domains are lysine-rich. Occasionally these residues are modified to allysine through the activity of members of the family of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and four LOX-like enzymes. During coacervation the allysine and other allysines or specific lysine side chains come into close proximity, allowing nonenzymatic condensation reactions to occur, forming desmosine or isodesmosine cross-links (4Mithieux S.M. Weiss A.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 437-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). This process gives a highly stable cross-linked elastin matrix which has a half-life of ∼70 years. Members of the serine, aspartate, cysteine, and matrix metalloproteinase families of proteases can degrade elastin (8Antonicelli F. Bellon G. Debelle L. Hornebeck W. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2007; 79: 99-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The resulting elastin peptides have effects on ECM synthesis and cell attachment, migration, and proliferation (9Duca L. Floquet N. Alix A.J. Haye B. Debelle L. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2004; 49: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).The consequences of mutated or hemizygous elastin in the hereditary, connective tissue disorders cutis laxa, supravalvular aortic stenosis, and Williams-Beuren syndrome highlight the elastins essential role in elastic tissue function (10Kielty C.M. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2006; 8: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Elastin is the major protein in large elastic blood vessels such as the aorta, where it is likely to inhibit the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and so preventing vessel occlusion (11Ito S. Ishimaru S. Wilson S.E. Angiology. 1998; 49: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which is a major cause of death in developed countries. Previous studies have shown that human and bovine tropoelastin can bind directly to a variety of cell types directly through a number of cell surface receptors (12Mecham R.P. Hinek A. Entwistle R.

Nature. 2002; 415: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar).A mechanism by which elastin binds to cells is via the 67-kDa elastin-binding protein (EBP), which is a peripheral membrane splice variant of β-galactosidase. The EBP forms a complex with the integral membrane proteins carboxypeptidase A and sialidase, forming a transmembrane elastin receptor (12Mecham R.P. Hinek A. Entwistle R. Wrenn D.S. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3716-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The binding site for the EBP has been mapped to the consensus sequence XGXXPG within elastin and in particular to VGVAPG within exon 24 (17Senior R.M. Griffin G.L. Mecham R.P. Wrenn D.S. Prasad K.U. Urry D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The binding of elastin to the EBP results in cell morphological changes (18Karnik S.K. Wythe J.D. Sorensen L.

Invest. 1982; 70: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), decreased cell proliferation (21Jung S. Rutka J.T. Hinek A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and angiogenesis (22Robinet A. Fahem A. Cauchard J.H. Huet E. Vincent L. Lorimier S. Antonicelli F. Soria C. Crepin M. Hornebeck W. Bellon G. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Knockouts of β-galactosidase, which remove the EBP, display correctly deposited elastin (27Hahn C.N. del Pilar Martin M. Schröder M. Vanier M.T. Hara Y. Suzuki K. Suzuki K. d'Azzo A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Additionally tropoelastin actively promotes cell adhesion, whereas VGVAPG does not. These observations imply that receptors other than EBP can interact with elastin.Other studies have proposed a second mechanism involving the necessity of cell surface heparan and chondroitin sulfate-containing glycosaminoglycans for bovine chondrocyte interaction with bovine tropoelastin (14Broekelmann T.J. Kozel B.A. Ishibashi H. Werneck C.C. Keeley F.W. Zhang L. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40939-40947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Peptide binding analysis implicated the last 17 amino acids at the C terminus of bovine tropoelastin in this cell adhesive activity, with higher binding requiring the C-terminal 25 amino acids. This region is of interest, as in humans a mutation of Gly-773 to Asp in exon 33 results in blocked elastin network assembly and modulates cell binding to a peptide corresponding to exons 33 and 36 of human tropoelastin (28Kelleher C.M. Silverman E.K. Broekelmann T. Litonjua A.A. Hernandez M. Sylvia J.S. Stoler J. Reilly J.J. Chapman H.A. Speizer F.E. Weiss S.T. Mecham R.P. Raby B.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 33: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed Broekelmann et al. (14Broekelmann T.J. Kozel B.A. Ishibashi H. Werneck C.C. Keeley F.W. Zhang L. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40939-40947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have shown that synthetic peptides containing the C-terminal 29 amino acids of bovine tropoelastin possess cell adhesive activity; however, when the G773D mutation was incorporated into the peptide, it prevented cell adhesion to that peptide.Although tropoelastin does not contain an RGD motif, other data identified a third mechanism involving direct interaction between integrin αvβ3 and human tropoelastin (13Rodgers U.R. Weiss A.S. Biochimie. 2004; 86: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 29Rodgers U.R. Weiss A.S. Pathol. Biol. 2005; 53: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This interaction was also localized to the C-terminal domains of tropoelastin.More recent data has shown that human umbilical vein endothelial cells can adhere to recombinant fragments of human tropoelastin (30Kielty C.M. Stephan S. Sherratt M.J. Williamson M. Shuttleworth C.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2007; 362: 1293-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Williamson M.R. Shuttleworth C.A. Canfield A.E Black R.A. Kielty C.M. Biomaterials. 2007; 28: 5307-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast to other data, regions encoded by the N-terminal exons (1–18), the central exons (18–27), and the C-terminal exons (18–36) all supported human umbilical vein endothelial cell attachment.Although a previous study has shown a direct interaction between purified integrin αvβ3 and human tropoelastin (13Rodgers U.R. Weiss A.S. Biochimie. 2004; 86: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the integrin dependence of cell adhesion to tropoelastin had not been demonstrated. Here we demonstrate that human dermal fibroblasts adhere to recombinant human tropoelastin and that inhibitors of the elastin-binding protein and cell surface heparan sulfate have no effect on cell adhesion. In contrast, cell adhesion was dependent upon the presence of divalent cations, indicating integrin dependence. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies identified integrin αVβ3 as the major receptor necessary for fibroblast adherence and spreading onto human tropoelastin. The binding motif for integrin-mediated cell adhesion is unknown; therefore, through the use of synthetic peptides, the adhesive activity was localized to the extreme C-terminal GRKRK motif of tropoelastin. This data present a novel mechanism for cell adhesion to human tropoelastin and identify a novel integrin binding motif within tropoelastin.DISCUSSIONCellular interactions with extracellular matrix proteins give vital cues to the cell for cell survival and tissue maintenance. Although integrin αVβ3 has been shown to interact directly with tropoelastin by solid phase analysis, the utilization of this integrin by cells adhering to human tropoelastin has not been studied. As tropoelastin is the major constituent of elastic tissue and in vivo elastic fibers are associated with cells (30Kielty C.M. Stephan S. Sherratt M.J. Williamson M. Shuttleworth C.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2007; 362: 1293-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 34Davis E.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 272: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we have investigated the cell binding properties of human tropoelastin.In these studies human skin fibroblasts were shown to be capable of attaching and spreading on recombinant human tropoelastin. The level of cell adhesion to human tropoelastin (68%) is consistent with the level of cell attachment observed on other elastic fiber proteins such as fibulin-5 (45% adhesion (35Lomas A.C. Mellody K.T. Freeman L.J. Bax D.V. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) and fibrillin-rich microfibrils (35% adhesion (36Bax D.V. Bernard S.E. Lomas A. Morgan A. Humphries J. Shuttleworth C.A. Humphries M.J. Kielty C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34605-34616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar)). Therefore, human tropoelastin is a truly cell adhesive protein.Soluble bovine elastin was not capable of supporting adhesion or spreading. Others have shown that the C terminus of tropoelastin may be lost in mature elastic fibers, which would account for the lack of cell interaction to soluble bovine elastin (37Broekelmann T.J. Ciliberto C.H. Shifren A. Mecham R.P. Matrix Biol. 2008; 27: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).A prior study using solid phase binding assays showed a direct interaction between purified integrin αvβ3 and the C-terminal exons of human tropoelastin (13Rodgers U.R. Weiss A.S. Biochimie. 2004; 86: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); however, the importance of this integrin in cell-human tropoelastin adhesion has not been studied. The attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix is often mediated by cell surface integrins in a cation-dependent manner (38Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the presence of EDTA blocked fibroblast adhesion to human tropoelastin. In the absence of cations Mn2+ could restore cell binding, whereas Mg2+ and Ca2+ had lower efficacy. This pattern of cation dependence is indicative of integrin-mediated adhesion (38Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, antibody LM609 and 17E6 inhibition of cell adherence identified integrin αvβ3 as the predominant receptor for human tropoelastin on human fibroblasts. These results show that integrin αvβ3 on cells can bind to tropoelastin. In contrast, others have shown no inhibition of chondrocyte adherence to tropoelastin using either EDTA or LM609. This may be because of cell lineage: i.e. bovine chondrocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells compared with fibroblasts utilized.The EBP, a previously identified tropoelastin receptor, binds to the sequence VGVAPG in exon 24 of tropoelastin and is inhibited by lactose (12Mecham R.P. Hinek A. Entwistle R. Wrenn D.S. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3716-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Senior R.M. Griffin G.L. Mecham R.P. Wrenn D.S. Prasad K.U. Urry D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In this study lactose did not inhibit cell binding, discounting the elastin-binding protein as the elastin receptor responsible for fibroblast adherence to human tropoelastin. This is consistent with reports of a lack of chondrocyte adherence observed on a fragment of tropoelastin encoded by exons 15–29, which contains VGVAPG (14Broekelmann T.J. Kozel B.A. Ishibashi H. Werneck C.C. Keeley F.W. Zhang L. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40939-40947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, β-galactosidase (which is alternately spliced to give a component of the EBP) knockout in mice, which would knock out the EBP, does not affect elastin deposition, indicating that another receptor is capable of compensating for the EBP (27Hahn C.N. del Pilar Martin M. Schröder M. Vanier M.T. Hara Y. Suzuki K. Suzuki K. d'Azzo A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In further support, peptides that contain VGVAPG are poorly adhesive but have potent chemotactic and signaling properties. As the EBP binding site possesses signaling rather than adhesive properties, these data indicate that adhesion and signaling activities of tropoelastin could be mediated by distinct receptors. Consistent with previous data (14Broekelmann T.J. Kozel B.A. Ishibashi H. Werneck C.C. Keeley F.W. Zhang L. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40939-40947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we observed no actin stress fiber assembly in cells adherent to human tropoelastin compared with cells adherent to plasma fibronectin (data not shown). Therefore, integrin engagement is necessary for cell adhesion to human tropoelastin but may not result in signaling into the cell necessary for cytoskeletal assembly.Cell surface glycosaminoglycans and, in particular, heparan sulfate have also been shown to mediate bovine chondrocyte-bovine tropoelastin interactions. In this study when heparan sulfate was added to fibroblasts no inhibition of cell adhesion was observed. Furthermore, EDTA lifting of cells had no effect on the mechanism of cell-tropoelastin interaction compared with trypsin lifting of cells (supplemental figures). This excludes the possibility that during lifting trypsin might have removed a heparan sulfate-mediated tropoelastin receptor from the cell surface required for heparan sulfate-mediated cell adhesion to tropoelastin. Interestingly, although heparan sulfate-mediated cell adhesion to bovine tropoelastin was assigned to the C terminus of tropoelastin, this was not contained in exon 36, as a peptide corresponding to the last 14 amino acids of bovine tropoelastin was not capable of supporting cell adhesion. The minimum sequence for bovine tropoelastin adhesion required the last 3 amino acids of exon 35 in conjunction with exon 36 (i.e. C-terminal 17 amino acids), with higher binding requiring the last 11 amino acids of exon 35 in conjunction with exon 36 (i.e. C-terminal 25 amino acids) (14Broekelmann T.J. Kozel B.A. Ishibashi H. Werneck C.C. Keeley F.W. Zhang L. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40939-40947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Human tropoelastin does not contain the exons 34 and 35 that are involved in heparan sulfate-mediated adhesion; however, human exon 33 has been proposed to substitute for bovine exon 35 (28Kelleher C.M. Silverman E.K. Broekelmann T. Litonjua A.A. Hernandez M. Sylvia J.S. Stoler J. Reilly J.J. Chapman H.A. Speizer F.E. Weiss S.T. Mecham R.P. Raby B.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 33: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This implies that the different mechanisms of human tropoelastin or bovine tropoelastin adhesion to cells may simply reflect differing cell lines utilized.It has been postulated cell surface heparan sulfate-mediated cell adhesion may be through cell surface syndecans (14Broekelmann T.J. Kozel B.A. Ishibashi H. Werneck C.C. Keeley F.W. Zhang L. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40939-40947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Syndecans have been shown to cooperatively signal with integrins to assemble the cellular cytoskeleton (39Morgan M.R. Humphries M.J. Bass M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Interestingly, chondrocytes, which adhere to tropoelastin through cell surface glycosaminoglycans, but not integrins, have a predominance of filopodial extensions which are similar to those seen for syndecan-2 or -3 overexpressing cells. As we observed no heparan sulfate dependence on cell adhesion and attachment and also no actin cytoskeletal assembly, it may be possible that in our system we did not recruit syndecans. It is possible that individual sites on tropoelastin are capable of mediating cell-tropoelastin interactions by binding to either integrin αvβ3 or cell surface glycosaminoglycans, and usage of both sites may be required for full cytoskeletal assembly.Others have previously reported cell adhesion to elastin through the bridging protein fibulin-5 (15Yanagisawa H. Davis E.C. Starcher B.C. Ouchi T. Yanagisawa M. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Nature. 2002; 415: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 16Nakamura T. Lozano P.R. Ikeda Y. Iwanaga Y. Hinek A. Minamisawa S. Cheng C.F. Kobuke K. Dalton N. Takada Y. Tashiro K. Ross Jr., J. Honjo T. Chien K.R. Nature. 2002; 415: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In our adhesion assays the cells are incubated with the tropoelastin surface for 40 min, reducing the possibility of cell-derived proteins functioning as a bridging molecule between tropoelastin and cellular receptors. Furthermore, previous data (13Rodgers U.R. Weiss A.S. Biochimie. 2004; 86: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have shown a direct interaction between integrin αVβ3 and human tropoelastin. This was performed in the absence of cells on recombinantly expressed tropoelastin. Therefore, there were no other proteins in this assay system that could reasonably bridge between tropoelastin and integrin αVβ3. Interestingly the whole of the tropoelastin molecule has been shown to be necessary for fibulin-5-tropoelastin association (40Wachi H. Nonaka R. Sato F. Shibata-Sato K. Ishida M. Iketani S. Maeda I. Okamoto K. Urban Z. Onoue S. Seyama Y. J. Biochem. 2008; 143: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and so fibulin-5 should not associate with our cell adhesive peptide 36 and GRKRK. Therefore, it is unlikely that fibulin-5 will bind to this small section of tropoelastin, making it unlikely that fibulin-5 is acting as a bridging molecule for cell adhesion. In addition, potential bridging proteins associated with elastic fibers, namely fibrillin-1 (41Rock M.J. Cain S.A. Freeman L.J. Morgan A. Mellody K. Marson A. Shuttleworth C.A. Weiss A.S. Kielty C.M.

As we observed no inhibition of cell binding to human tropoelastin by RGD peptides, it is unlikely that these proteins act as bridging proteins between cells and human tropoelastin. Additionally, fibrillin-1 possesses dependence upon different integrin receptors to mediate cell binding than a predominance of integrin αVβ3 (36Bax D.V. Bernard S.E. Lomas A. Morgan A. Humphries J.

The protein synthesis blocker, actinomycin D, had no inhibitory effect on cell adhesion to tropoelastin (supplemental figures), giving additional evidence that cells can interact directly with tropoelastin rather than through a cell-derived bridging protein. Therefore, we have shown a direct binding interaction between integrin αVβ3 and human tropoelastin (13Rodgers U.R. Weiss A.S. Biochimie. 2004; 86: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which we have now shown results in cell adhesion to tropoelastin.In this study we have used synthetic peptides to map cell binding to the C-terminal 5 amino acids of exon 36. Furthermore, we have shown integrin-mediated cell adhesion to this motif, identifying GRKRK as a novel integrin binding motif. Indeed there is no classical RGD integrin recognition site in tropoelastin; however, not all integrin-receptor ligation is via RGD motifs. For example, Cyr61, fibrinogen, tumstatin, and the collagen α3(IV) NC1 domain do not bind via RGD motifs. Furthermore, integrin α1β1 recognizes the motif RKKH, which is very similar to the RKRK motif that we have identified as being necessary for cell interaction (44Nymalm Y. Puranen J.S. Nyholm T.K. Käpylä J. Kidron H. Pentikäinen O.T. Airenne T.T. Heino J. Slotte J.P. Johnson M.S. Salminen T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7962-7970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly the RKRK motif is highly conserved between divergent species, indicating that it possesses a vital function.Although we have identified integrin αVβ3 as a cellular receptor for human tropoelastin, the in vivo importance of this interaction is unknown. Integrins have been implicated in many biological functions such as cell migration and proliferation, tissue organization, and roles in the pathogenesis of disease.Integrin αVβ3 could be involved in tropoelastin deposition onto maturing elastic fibers. This is consistent with the identified interaction with tropoelastin, i.e. the non-deposited, progenitor of elastin. Integrins are implicated in ECM assembly, including αVβ3 participation in fibronectin network deposition (45Leiss M. Beckmann K. Girós A. Costell M. Fässler R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, the αVβ3 knock-out mouse has apparently functional elastic lamellae in blood vessels (46Choi E.T. Khan M.F. Leidenfrost J.E. Collins E.T. Boc K.P. Villa B.R. Novack D.V. Parks W.C. Abendschein D.R. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, this receptor may not be solely responsible for elastic fiber deposition and assembly and may point to involvement of multiple tropoelastin receptors in elastogenesis.In this study we have shown that cell adhesion is predominantly mediated through integrin αVβ3 and the C terminus of tropoelastin, which could implicate this integrin in elastin fiber assembly. Mutation G773D, which is present in exon 33, N-terminal to exon 36 in human tropoelastin, blocks cell binding but also prevents cellular deposition of elastin to form fiber-like structures, implicating cell adhesion in the assembly of tropoelastin fibers (28Kelleher C.M.

https://openalex.org/W1978006472,"Virus-host biological interaction is a continuous coevolutionary process involving both host immune system and viral escape mechanisms. Flaviviridae family is composed of fast evolving RNA viruses that infects vertebrate (mammals and birds) and/or invertebrate (ticks and mosquitoes) organisms. These host groups are very distinct life forms separated by a long evolutionary time, so lineage-specific anti-viral mechanisms are likely to have evolved. Flaviviridae viruses which infect a single host lineage would be subjected to specific host-induced pressures and, therefore, selected by them. In this work we compare the genomic evolutionary patterns of Flaviviridae viruses and their hosts in an attempt to uncover coevolutionary processes inducing common features in such disparate groups. Especially, we have analyzed dinucleotide and codon usage patterns in the coding regions of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms as well as in Flaviviridae viruses which specifically infect one or both host types. The two host groups possess very distinctive dinucleotide and codon usage patterns. A pronounced CpG under-representation was found in the vertebrate group, possibly induced by the methylation-deamination process, as well as a prominent TpA decrease. The invertebrate group displayed only a TpA frequency reduction bias. Flaviviridae viruses mimicked host nucleotide motif usage in a host-specific manner. Vertebrate-infecting viruses possessed under-representation of CpG and TpA, and insect-only viruses displayed only a TpA under-representation bias. Single-host Flaviviridae members which persistently infect mammals or insect hosts (Hepacivirus and insect-only Flavivirus, respectively) were found to posses a codon usage profile more similar to that of their hosts than to related Flaviviridae. We demonstrated that vertebrates and mosquitoes genomes are under very distinct lineage-specific constraints, and Flaviviridae viruses which specifically infect these lineages appear to be subject to the same evolutionary pressures that shaped their host coding regions, evidencing the lineage-specific coevolutionary processes between the viral and host groups."

The mechanism by which the PKCι–Par6α complex regulates Rac1 is unknown. Here we show that epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 (Ect2), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho family GTPases, is coordinately amplified and overexpressed with PKCι in NSCLC tumors. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Ect2 inhibits Rac1 activity and blocks transformed growth, invasion and tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells. Expression of constitutively active Rac1 (RacV12) restores transformation to Ect2-deficient cells. Interestingly, the role of Ect2 in transformation is distinct from its well-established role in cytokinesis. In NSCLC cells, Ect2 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it binds the PKCι–Par6α complex. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of either PKCι or Par6α causes Ect2 to redistribute to the nucleus, indicating that the PKCι–Par6α complex regulates the cytoplasmic localization of Ect2. Our data indicate that Ect2 and PKCι are genetically and functionally linked in NSCLC, acting to coordinately drive tumor cell proliferation and invasion through formation of an oncogenic PKCι–Par6α-Ect2 complex."

The neuraminidase (NA) stalk region of influenza virus varies considerably and may associate with its virulence. The NA stalk region of all N1 subtype influenza A viruses can be divided into six different stalk-motifs, H5N1/2004-like (NA-wt), WSN-like, H5N1/97-like, PR/8-like, H7N1/99-like and H5N1/96-like. The NA-wt is a special NA stalk-motif which was first observed in H5N1 influenza virus in 2000, with a 20-amino acid deletion in the 49(th) to 68(th) positions of the stalk region. Here we show that there is a gradual increase of the special NA stalk-motif in H5N1 isolates from 2000 to 2007, and notably, the special stalk-motif is observed in all 173 H5N1 human isolates from 2004 to 2007. The recombinant H5N1 virus with the special stalk-motif possesses the highest virulence and pathogenicity in chicken and mice, while the recombinant viruses with the other stalk-motifs display attenuated phenotype. This indicates that the special stalk-motif has contributed to the high virulence and pathogenicity of H5N1 isolates since 2000. The gradually increasing emergence of the special NA stalk-motif in H5N1 isolates, especially in human isolates, deserves attention by all."
https://openalex.org/W2000265203,"Macrophages participate pivotally in the pathogenesis of many chronic inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis. Adiponectin, a vasculoprotective molecule with insulin-sensitizing and anti-atherogenic properties, suppresses pro-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages by mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. This study investigated the effects of adiponectin on major pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in human macrophages. We demonstrate that pretreatment of these cells with adiponectin inhibits phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappaB inhibitor (IkappaB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), induced by either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, as well as STAT3 phosphorylation induced by interleukin-6 (IL6). Antagonism of IL10 by either neutralizing antibodies or siRNA-mediated silencing did not abrogate the anti-inflammatory actions of adiponectin, indicating that the ability of adiponectin to render human macrophages tolerant to various pro-inflammatory stimuli does not require this cytokine. A systematic search for adiponectin-inducible genes with established anti-inflammatory properties revealed that adiponectin augmented the expression of A20, suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 3, B-cell CLL/lymphoma (BCL) 3, TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 1, and TNFAIP3-interacting protein (TNIP) 3. These results suggest that adiponectin triggers a multifaceted response in human macrophages by inducing the expression of various anti-inflammatory proteins that act at different levels in concert to suppress macrophage activation."

However, previous studies on longitudinal changes of tau and Abeta42 in individual patients with AD and elderly controls report somewhat inconsistent results.We investigated the levels of tau and Abeta42 at baseline and after 1 year in 100 patients with AD. In a second cohort of 45 AD patients we measured the CSF biomarkers at baseline and after 2 years. Moreover, in 34 healthy elderly controls the CSF biomarkers were followed for 4 years. The baseline levels of tau were increased with >60% in AD patients compared to controls (p<0.001), while baseline Abeta42 levels were decreased with >50% (p<0.001). In the AD group followed for 2 years, tau increased with 16% compared to the baseline levels (p<0.05). However, the levels of tau were stable over 4 years in the controls. The levels of Abeta42 did not change significantly over time in any of the groups. In the patients with AD, tau was moderately associated with worse cognitive performance already at baseline (p<0.05).Tau and Abeta42 in CSF seem to reflect the underlying disease state in both early and late stages of AD. The slight increase in tau over time observed in the patients with AD is modest when compared to the relatively large difference in absolute tau levels between AD patients and controls. Therefore, these markers maintain their usefulness as state markers over time and might serve as surrogate markers for treatment efficacy in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W1991014863,"Rapid growth of the embryonic heart occurs by addition of progenitor cells of the second heart field to the poles of the elongating heart tube. Failure or perturbation of this process leads to congenital heart defects. In order to provide further insight into second heart field development we characterized the insertion site of a transgene expressed in the second heart field and outflow tract as the result of an integration site position effect.Here we show that the integration site of the A17-Myf5-nlacZ-T55 transgene lies upstream of Hes1, encoding a basic helix-loop-helix containing transcriptional repressor required for the maintenance of diverse progenitor cell populations during embryonic development. Transgene expression in a subset of Hes1 expression sites, including the CNS, pharyngeal epithelia, pericardium, limb bud and lung endoderm suggests that Hes1 is the endogenous target of regulatory elements trapped by the transgene. Hes1 is expressed in pharyngeal endoderm and mesoderm including the second heart field. Analysis of Hes1 mutant hearts at embryonic day 15.5 reveals outflow tract alignment defects including ventricular septal defects and overriding aorta. At earlier developmental stages, Hes1 mutant embryos display defects in second heart field proliferation, a reduction in cardiac neural crest cells and failure to completely extend the outflow tract.Hes1 is expressed in cardiac progenitor cells in the early embryo and is required for development of the arterial pole of the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2025367858,"Photosystem II is vulnerable to light damage. The reaction center-binding D1 protein is impaired during excessive illumination and is degraded and removed from photosystem II. Using isolated spinach thylakoids, we investigated the relationship between light-induced unstacking of thylakoids and damage to the D1 protein. Under light stress, thylakoids were expected to become unstacked so that the photodamaged photosystem II complexes in the grana and the proteases could move on the thylakoids for repair. Excessive light induced irreversible unstacking of thylakoids. By comparing the effects of light stress on stacked and unstacked thylakoids, photoinhibition of photosystem II was found to be more prominent in stacked thylakoids than in unstacked thylakoids. In accordance with this finding, EPR spin trapping measurements demonstrated higher production of hydroxyl radicals in stacked thylakoids than in unstacked thylakoids. We propose that unstacking of thylakoids has a crucial role in avoiding further damage to the D1 protein and facilitating degradation of the photodamaged D1 protein under light stress."
https://openalex.org/W1970886429,"The most common mutation in cystic fibrosis (CF) is DeltaF508, which is associated with failure of the mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) to traffic to the plasma membrane. By a still unknown mechanism, the loss of correctly trafficked DeltaF508-CFTR results in an excess of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) on the apical plasma membrane. ENaC trafficking is known to be regulated by a signaling pathway involving the glucocorticoid receptor, the serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase SGK1, and the ubiquitin E3 ligase Nedd4-2. We show here that dexamethasone rescues functional expression of DeltaF508-CFTR. The half-life of DeltaF508-CFTR is also dramatically enhanced. Dexamethasone-activated DeltaF508-CFTR rescue is blocked either by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 or by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicate that Nedd4-2 binds to both wild-type- and DeltaF508-CFTR. These complexes are inhibited by dexamethasone treatment, and CFTR ubiquitination is concomitantly decreased. We further show that knockdown of Nedd4-2 by small interfering RNA also corrects DeltaF508-CFTR trafficking. Conversely, knockdown of SGK1 by small interfering RNA completely blocks dexamethasone-activated DeltaF508-CFTR rescue. These data suggest that the SGK1/Nedd4-2 signaling pathway regulates both CFTR and ENaC trafficking in CF epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2093879310,"Bone morphogenetic protein-1-like proteinases play key roles in formation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in vertebrates via biosynthetic processing of precursors into mature functional proteins involved in ECM assembly. Such processing includes proteolytic activation of the zymogen for lysyl oxidase. Fibronectin (FN) is an abundant protein component of the ECM that is capable of regulating manifold cellular functions through its interactions with various ECM and cell surface proteins. It was previously shown that proteolytic activation of lysyl oxidase is much reduced in cultures of FN-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Here we demonstrate that cellular fibronectin, the form produced by fibroblasts and various other tissue cell types, and plasma fibronectin bind BMP1 with dissociation constants (KD) of approximately 100 nM, consistent with a physiological role. Also consistent with such a role, cellular fibronectin FN is shown to positively regulate BMP1 processing activity against Chordin, probiglycan, and type I procollagen in vitro. Endogenous FN and BMP1 are demonstrated to co-localize in cell layers and to form complexes in culture medium. In addition, processing of endogenous BMP1 substrates Chordin, probiglycan, and procollagen is demonstrated to be strikingly reduced in cultures of FN(-/-) MEFs compared with FN(+/-) MEF cultures despite similar levels of endogenous BMP1. These data support the conclusion that FN binds BMP1-like proteinases in vivo and that FN is an important determinant of the in vivo activity levels of BMP1-like proteinases."
https://openalex.org/W2144085044,"The lantibiotic nisin is a potent antimicrobial substance, which contains unusual lanthionine rings and dehydrated amino acid residues and is produced by Lactococcus lactis. Recently, the nisin biosynthetic machinery has been applied to introduce lanthionine rings in peptides other than nisin with potential therapeutic use. Due to difficulties in the isolation of the proposed synthetase complex (NisBTC), mechanistic information concerning the enzymatic biosynthesis of nisin is scarce. Here, we present the molecular characterization of a number of nisin mutants that affect ring formation. We have investigated in a systematic manner how these mutations influence dehydration events, which are performed enzymatically by the dehydratase NisB. Specific mutations that hampered ring formation allowed for the dehydration of serine residues that directly follow the rings and are normally unmodified. The combined information leads to the conclusion that 1) nisin biosynthesis is an organized directional process that starts at the N terminus of the molecule and continues toward the C terminus, and 2) NisB and NisC are alternating enzymes, whose activities follow one after another in a repetitive way. Thus, the dehydration and cyclization processes are not separated in time and space. On the basis of these results and previous knowledge, a working model for the sequence of events in the maturation of nisin is proposed."

Low copy number and concomitant low mRNA expression of the HBD2 gene have been implicated in susceptibility to colonic Crohn's Disease (CD). We investigated the colonic distribution of HBD2 mRNA expression, and the contributions of genetic and environmental factors on HBD2 protein production.We examined HBD2 mRNA expression at three colonic locations by microarray analysis of biopsies from 151 patients (53 CD, 67 ulcerative colitis [UC], 31 controls). We investigated environmental and genetic influences on HBD2 protein production using ex vivo cultured sigmoid colon biopsies from 69 patients (22 CD, 26 UC, 21 controls) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or nicotine for 24 hours. HBD2 and cytokines were measured in culture supernatants. Using DNA samples from these patients, regions in the HBD2 gene promoter were sequenced for NF-kappaB binding-sites and HBD2 gene copy number was determined. HBD2 mRNA expression was highest in inflamed (vs. uninflamed p = 0.0122) ascending colon in CD and in inflamed (vs. uninflamed p<0.0001) sigmoid colon in UC. HBD2 protein production was increased in inflamed UC biopsies (p = 0.0078). There was no difference in HBD2 protein production from unstimulated biopsies of CD, UC and controls. LPS-induced HBD2 production was significantly increased in CD (p = 0.0375) but not UC (p = 0.2017); this LPS-induced response was augmented by nicotine in UC (p = 0.0308) but not CD (p = 0.6872). Nicotine alone did not affect HBD2 production. HBD2 production correlated with IL8 production in UC (p<0.001) and with IL10 in CD (p<0.05). Variations in the HBD2 promoter and HBD2 gene copy number did not affect HBD2 production.Colonic HBD2 was dysregulated at mRNA and protein level in IBD.

https://openalex.org/W2172113588,"Peptides based on the second heptad repeat (HR2) of viral class I fusion proteins are effective inhibitors of virus entry. One such fusion inhibitor has been approved for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (T20, enfuvirtide). Resistance to T20 usually maps to the peptide binding site in HR1. To better understand fusion inhibitor potency and resistance, we combined virological, computational, and biophysical experiments with comprehensive mutational analyses and tested resistance to T20 and second and third generation inhibitors (T1249 and T2635). We found that most amino acid substitutions caused resistance to the first generation peptide T20. Only charged amino acids caused resistance to T1249, and none caused resistance to T2635. Depending on the drug, we can distinguish four mechanisms of drug resistance: reduced contact, steric obstruction, electrostatic repulsion, and electrostatic attraction. Implications for the design of novel antiviral peptide inhibitors are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2098423712,"Angiogenesis has key roles in development and in the progression of human diseases such as cancer. Consequently, identifying the novel markers and regulators of angiogenesis is a critical task. The dioxin receptor (AhR) contributes to vascular homeostasis and to the endothelial response to toxins, although the mechanisms involved are largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that AhR-null mice (AhR(-/-)) have impaired angiogenesis in vivo that compromises tumor xenograft growth. Aortic rings emigration experiments and RNA interference indicated that AhR(-/-) endothelial cells failed to branch and to form tube-like structures. Such a phenotype was found to be vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent, as AhR(-/-) aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) secreted lower amounts of active VEGF-A and their treatment with VEGF-A rescued angiogenesis in culture and in vivo. Further, the addition of anti-VEGF antibody to AhR(+/+) MAECs reduced angiogenesis. Treatment under hypoxic conditions with 2-methoxyestradiol suggested that HIF-1alpha modulates endothelial VEGF expression in an AhR-dependent manner. Importantly, AhR-null stromal myofibroblasts produced increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) activity, which inhibited angiogenesis in human endothelial cells (HMECs) and AhR(-/-) mice, whereas the co-culture of HMECs with AhR(-/-) myofibroblasts or with their conditioned medium inhibited branching, which was restored by an anti-TGFbeta antibody. Moreover, VEGF and TGFbeta activities cooperated in modulating angiogenesis, as the addition of TGFbeta to AhR(-/-) MAECs further reduced their low basal VEGF-A activity. Thus, AhR modulates angiogenesis through a mechanism requiring VEGF activation in the endothelium and TGFbeta inactivation in the stroma. These data highlight the role of AhR in cardiovascular homeostasis and suggest that this receptor can be a novel regulator of angiogenesis during tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W1971894436,"Background Despite low incidence, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths and it has the highest mortality rate of all gynecologic malignancies among US women. The mortality rate would be reduced with an early detection marker. The folate receptor alpha (FRα) is one logical choice for a biomarker because of its prevalent overexpression in ovarian cancer and its exclusive expression in only a few normal tissues. In prior work, it was observed that patients with ovarian cancer had elevated serum levels of a protein that bound to a FRα-specific monoclonal antibody relative to healthy individuals. However, it was not shown that the protein detected was intact functional FRα. In the current study, the goal was to determine whether ovarian cancer patients (n = 30) had elevated serum levels of a fully functional intact FRα compared to matched healthy controls (n = 30). Methodology/Principal Findings FRα levels in serum were analyzed by two methods, immunoblotting analysis and a radiolabeled folic acid-based microfiltration binding assay. Using the immunoassay, we observed that levels of FRα were higher in serum of ovarian cancer patients as compared to controls. Similar results were also observed using the microfiltration binding assay, which showed that the circulating FRα is functional. Importantly, we also found that the levels of FRα were comparable between early and advanced stage patients. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that ovarian cancer patients have elevated levels of functional intact FRα. These findings support the potential use of circulating FRα as a biomarker of early ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2011611385,"Estrogens produce biological effects by interacting with two estrogen receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta. Drugs that selectively target ERalpha or ERbeta might be safer for conditions that have been traditionally treated with non-selective estrogens. Several synthetic and natural ERbeta-selective compounds have been identified. One class of ERbeta-selective agonists is represented by ERB-041 (WAY-202041) which binds to ERbeta much greater than ERalpha. A second class of ERbeta-selective agonists derived from plants include MF101, nyasol and liquiritigenin that bind similarly to both ERs, but only activate transcription with ERbeta. Diarylpropionitrile represents a third class of ERbeta-selective compounds because its selectivity is due to a combination of greater binding to ERbeta and transcriptional activity. However, it is unclear if these three classes of ERbeta-selective compounds produce similar biological activities. The goals of these studies were to determine the relative ERbeta selectivity and pattern of gene expression of these three classes of ERbeta-selective compounds compared to estradiol (E(2)), which is a non-selective ER agonist. U2OS cells stably transfected with ERalpha or ERbeta were treated with E(2) or the ERbeta-selective compounds for 6 h. Microarray data demonstrated that ERB-041, MF101 and liquiritigenin were the most ERbeta-selective agonists compared to estradiol, followed by nyasol and then diarylpropionitrile. FRET analysis showed that all compounds induced a similar conformation of ERbeta, which is consistent with the finding that most genes regulated by the ERbeta-selective compounds were similar to each other and E(2). However, there were some classes of genes differentially regulated by the ERbeta agonists and E(2). Two ERbeta-selective compounds, MF101 and liquiritigenin had cell type-specific effects as they regulated different genes in HeLa, Caco-2 and Ishikawa cell lines expressing ERbeta. Our gene profiling studies demonstrate that while most of the genes were commonly regulated by ERbeta-selective agonists and E(2), there were some genes regulated that were distinct from each other and E(2), suggesting that different ERbeta-selective agonists might produce distinct biological and clinical effects."

The mechanism of caspase-7 activation by granzyme B and caspase-3 has been well characterized. However, whether other proteases such as calpains activate or inactivate caspase-7 is not known. Here, we present that recombinant caspase-7 is directly cleaved by calpain-1 within the large subunit of caspase-7 to produce two novel products, large subunit p18 and p17. This new form of caspase-7 has a 6-fold increase in Vmax when compared with the previously characterized p20/p12 form. Zymography revealed that the smaller caspase-7 product (p17) is 18-fold more active than either the caspase-3-cleaved product (p20) or the larger calpain-1 product of caspase-7 (p18). Mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis identified the calpain cleavage sites within the caspase-7 large subunit at amino acid 36 and 45/47. These proteolysis events occur in vivo as indicated by the accumulation of caspase-7 p18 and p17 subunits in cortical neurons undergoing Ca2+ dysregulation. Further, cleavage at amino acid 45/47 of caspase-7 by calpain results in a reduction in nuclear localization when compared with the caspase-3 cleavage product of caspase-7 (p20).

Zymography revealed that the smaller caspase-7 product (p17) is 18-fold more active than either the caspase-3-cleaved product (p20) or the larger calpain-1 product of caspase-7 (p18). Mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis identified the calpain cleavage sites within the caspase-7 large subunit at amino acid 36 and 45/47. These proteolysis events occur in vivo as indicated by the accumulation of caspase-7 p18 and p17 subunits in cortical neurons undergoing Ca2+ dysregulation. Further, cleavage at amino acid 45/47 of caspase-7 by calpain results in a reduction in nuclear localization when compared with the caspase-3 cleavage product of caspase-7 (p20). Our studies suggest the calpain-activated form of caspase-7 has unique enzymatic activity, localization, and binding affinity when compared with the caspase-activated form. Apoptosis is a well-defined cellular destruction pathway that primarily utilizes a family of cysteine proteases, the caspases (1Zhivotovsky B. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 2Thornberry N.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This cell death program can be initiated by cell death receptor activation (extrinsic pathway) or a variety of drugs or cellular stresses (intrinsic pathway) leading to activation of apical caspase-8, -9, and/or -10 (1Zhivotovsky B. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 3Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 4Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). These initiator caspases in turn directly activate the executioner caspases, caspase-3 and -7, which through proteolysis of defined substrates are responsible for the dismantling of the cell and subsequent death (3Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 4Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Granzyme B, released by cytotoxic T lymphocytes to protect the host from pathogens and tumor cells, can also initiate this apoptotic cascade and therefore is considered an apical caspase mimic (5Zhou Q. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Yang X. Stennicke H.R. Wang B. Green D.R. Jänicke R.U. Srinivasan A. Seth P. Salvesen G.S. Froelich C.J. J.

Med. 1997; 186: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). All caspases, as well as granzyme B, preferentially cleave after aspartic acid residues, with many having well-defined consensus sequences, making substrate cleavage sites easy to predict and establish (3Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 4Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 7Talanian R.V. Yang X.

Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Caspases exist in a latent form prior to activation. Both the initiator and executioner caspases are synthesized as a single chain protein, which require proteolytic cleavage to become active. Procaspase-7 is expressed as a 303-amino acid residue polypeptide chain. The activation and regulation of executioner caspase-7 by caspases and granzyme B has been extensively studied. Caspase-7 requires cleavage by caspase-3 and caspase-8/-10 or granzyme B, for activation (6Yang X. Stennicke H.R. Wang B. Green D.R. Jänicke R.U. Srinivasan A. Seth P. Salvesen G.S. Froelich C.J. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34042-34050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that caspase-3 initially cleaves off the first 23 amino acids (propeptide, 2 kDa), followed by caspase-8/-10 or granzyme B cleaving between the large (20 kDa) and small (12 kDa) subunit after amino acid 198 to activate the enzyme. The large subunit containing the catalytic His-237 and Cys-285 (caspase-1 numbering convention), and the small subunit are involved in the formation of the substrate-binding region. In vitro, granzyme B can also activate caspase-7 independently of caspase-3, but this does not appear to occur in vivo (5Zhou Q. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 6Yang X. Stennicke H.R. Wang B. Green D.R. Jänicke R.U. Srinivasan A. Seth P. Salvesen G.S. Froelich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34278-34283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Currently, there is no evidence that other classes of proteases play a role in activating or modulating caspase-7 activity. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels influence apoptosis in a number of cell types (10Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M. López-Rivas A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Tong J.X. Eichler M.E. Rich K.M. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 138: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 12Zhivotovsky B.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 3690-3697PubMed Google Scholar). Because in many of these apoptotic cell models the Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases, calpains, are activated upstream of caspases (14Altznauer F. Conus S. Cavalli A. Folkers G. Simon H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5947-5957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Chaitanya G.V. Babu P.P. Neurochem. Res. 2008; 33: 2178-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Wu J. Liu T. Xie J. Xin F. Guo L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it is possible that calpains may activate and/or modulate caspase activity via direct cleavage. Studies directed at understanding calpains with respect to caspase activation are limited. Calpain-2 was shown to cleave procaspase-9, decreasing its activity (17Chua B.T. Guo K. Li P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5131-5135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In the same study, calpain-2 treatment cleaved procaspase-7 to produce a single, novel fragment, but in this case the effect on enzymatic activity was not investigated (17Chua B.T. Guo K. Li P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5131-5135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To improve our understanding of calpains and the role of calcium in cell death, we carried out studies directed at understanding how calpains activate or modulate caspase activity. We found that calpain treatment produced a large increase in caspase-7 activity. Calpain cleaves procaspase-7 to produce two large subunits of 18.5 and 17.2 kDa, the smaller of which has a robust increase in activity relative to the 20-kDa large subunit produced by caspase-3 cleavage of caspase-7. Both calpain cleavage sites in caspase-7 are identified using mass spectrometry. N-methyl-d-aspartate-induced Ca2+-dependent cell death in primary cortical neurons produced calpain-derived caspase-7 cleavage products in vivo. Lastly, the strictly cytosolic localization of the smaller calpain fragment confirms that a previously identified nuclear localization signal (18Yaoita Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is involved in caspase-7 cytosolic/nuclear distribution. Our data suggest that increases in Ca2+ leading to activation of calpains may significantly modulate caspase-7 activity and thus, apoptosis. Caspase-1 through caspase-3 and caspase-5 through-10 plasmids and active caspase-7, -8, -10, and -11 were gifts from Guy Salvesen. Caspase-4 plasmid was a gift from Jean-Louis Lalanne. Mouse caspase-12 and human caspase-13 plasmids were cloned into pcDNA3 by PCR amplification and sequenced. Procaspase-7, truncated caspase-7, active caspase-1 through caspase-6 and granzyme B were purchased from Biomol. Calpain-1 was obtained from Calbiochem, and calpain-2 was obtained from Sigma. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify and evaluate calpain cleavage of caspase-7. Amino acids 35–37, 44–46, and 46–48 were deleted individually in the pcDNA3-caspase-7-FLAG construct (9Denault J.B. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34042-34050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Amino acids 43–46 were subsequently deleted from the pcDNA3-caspase-7 (Δ46–48)-FLAG construct to produce a Δ43–48 mutant. The aspartate at amino acid 23 was mutated to an asparagine in pcDNA3-caspase-7-FLAG construct to use as control. Sites were deleted or mutated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using the following primers: caspase-7 Δ35–37, F 5′-GGTCCTCGTTTGTACCGTCCAAGAAGAAGAAAAATGTC-3′, R 5′-GACATTTTTTCTTCTTCTTGGACGGTACAAACGAGGACC-3′; caspase-7 Δ44–46, F 5′-GTAAGAAGAAGAAAAATGTCTCCATCAAGACCACCCGGG-3′, R 5′-CCCGGGTGGTCTTGATGGAGACATTTTTCTTCTTCTTAC-3′; caspase-7 Δ46–48, F 5′-GAAGAAAAATGTCACCATGAAGACCACCCGGGACCGAG-3′, R 5′-CTCGGTCCCGGGTGGTCTTCATGGTGACATTTTTCTTC-3′; caspase-7 Δ43–45, F 5′-CAGTAAGAAGAAG-AAAAATAAGACCACCCGGGACCGAG-3′, R 5′-CTCGGTCCCGGGTGGTCTTATTTTTCTTCTTCTTACTG-3′; D23N, F 5′-GCAAATGAAGATTCAGTGAATGCTAAGCCAGACCGGTCC-3′, R 5′-GGACCGGTCTGGCTTAGCATTCACTGAATCTTCATTTGC-3′. Polymerase chain reactions were performed using 100 ng of DNA, 5.0 μl of 10× Pfu buffer (Stratagene), 0.2 mm dNTPs (Promega), 125 ng each of forward and reverse primers (Integrated DNA Technologies), 5.0% Me2SO, and 1.0 μl Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) for 16 cycles at 96 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 65 °C for 20 min, then 65 °C for 7 min. Plasmids were DpnI (Promega)-treated, transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene), and purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Caspase-7 constructs representing the C terminus of caspase-7 after cleavage with calpain (amino acids 37–303 and 48–303) or caspase-7 (amino acids 24–303) were made utilizing the pcDNA3-caspase-7-FLAG construct (9Denault J.B. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34042-34050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The caspase-7 C-terminal products were amplified using polymerase chain reaction with the following primers: caspase-7 24–303, F 5′-AAACTAGGTACCTAGGCCATGGCTAAGCCAGAC-3′; Cs7 37–303, F 5′-AAACTAGGTACCTAGGCCATGAGTAAGAAGAAG-3′; Cs7 48–303, F 5′-AAACTAGGTACCTAGGCCATGATCAAGACCACC-3′; caspase-7-FLAG, R 5′-TGCATGCTCGAGCTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTT-3′. Polymerase chain reactions were performed using 100 ng of pcDNA3-caspase7-FLAG, 5.0 μl of 10X Pfu buffer (Stratagene), 0.2 mm dNTPs (Promega), 100 ng each of forward and reverse primers (Integrated DNA Technologies), 5.0% Me2SO, and 1.0 μl Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) for 30 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 56 °C-62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min, then 72 °C for 10 min. Samples were purified using the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit and Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). DNA inserts were then cleaved with Xho1/KPN1 (Promega), re-purified, and ligated to an Xho1/KPN1-treated pcDNA3 plasmid using T4 DNA ligase (Promega) overnight at 16 °C. Final constructs were verified using DNA sequencing. Caspase constructs were translated with 35S-labeled methionine (Promega coupled kit) and incubated with 9.0 units of calpain-1 in Nonidet P40 buffer (19Gafni J. Hermel E. Young J.E. Wellington C.L.

Purified procaspase-7, ΔΝ caspase-7 (no prodomain) or active caspases were treated with calpain-1 (9.0 units) or calpain-2 (100 units) for 30 min at 30 °C in Nonidet P40 buffer with 5 μm DTT and 20 mm CaCl2. In some cases, samples were co-incubated with granzyme B (200 units). One unit of granzyme B is defined as the amount of enzyme that will hydrolyze 1 pmol of Ac-IEPD-pNA in 1 min at 30 °C. Following incubation, caspase activity was measured using appropriate fluorescently tagged substrates. Substrates used were: Ac-YVAD-AFC (Biomol) for caspase-1, -4, -5, and -11, Ac-VDVAD-AMC (Biomol) for caspase-2, (z-DEVD)2-R110 (Cell Technology, Inc) and Ac-DEVD-AMC (Biomol) for caspase-3 and -7, Ac-IETD-AMC (Biomol) for caspase-6 and -8 and Ac-LEHD-AFC (Biomol) for caspase-10. Change in fluorescence was measured in a caspase assay buffer (20 mm Pipes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 10 mm DTT) at 37 °C for 1 h in a SpectraMAX Gemini fluorimeter (Molecular Devices Corporation). A Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison test was used to determine statistical significance. Superfect reagent (Qiagen) was used for transient transfections in human embryonic kidney 293T cells with the pcDNA3-caspase7-FLAG constructs described above. Primary cortical cultures were made from ED16 mice and treated with AraC for 24 h at 3 DIV. Cultures were treated with 0, 100, or 250 μm N-methyl-d-aspartate for 3 h at 12 DIV. Cells were lysed with mammalian protein extraction reagent (MPER, Pierce) or fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions with the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic reagents (Pierce) in the presence of protease inhibitors (Complete mini, Roche Applied Science). Protein was determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). In some cases, samples were treated with 0.9 to 12.0 units of calpain-1 at 30 °C for 10 to 30 min with or without co-incubation with 200 units of granzyme B. Samples were boiled in NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) with 50 mm DTT, resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with the following antibodies: polyclonal caspase-7 9492 (1:200, Cell Signaling), polyclonal-cleaved caspase-7 9491S (1:200, Cell Signaling), polyclonal DYKDDDDK tag 2368 (1:200, Cell Signaling), polyclonal DYKDDDDK tag T503 (4.0 μg/ml, Signalway Antibody), monoclonal α-tubulin T-6119 (1.0 μg/ml, Sigma), polyclonal calreticulin (1:20,000, Stressgene), and polyclonal poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase SA-253 (PARP; 1:3000, Biomol). Proteins were subsequently visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Scientific). Purified active caspase-7 was incubated with calpain-1 (9.0 units) at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm CaCl2, and 5 μm DTT. The samples were concentrated and purified using ZipTipC4® pipette tips (Millipore) prior to mass spectrometric analysis following manufacturer's instruction. Mass spectra of the samples were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry on a Voyager DESTR plus instrument (Applied Biosystems) using 3.5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid) as the matrix. Cytochrome c (Sigma) was used as external standard for calibration. For the vMALDI experiment, ΔN caspase-7 was incubated with calpain-1 (9.0 units) at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm CaCl2, and 5 μm DTT. The samples were then concentrated and purified using ZipTipC18® pipette tips (Millipore) prior to mass spectrometric analysis following manufacturer's instruction. Mass spectra of the samples were obtained on a vMALDI-linear trap quadrupole (LTQ) mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) using manual data acquisition. Threshold values of 1800 counts for MS and 80 counts for MS2 were applied to collect spectra. Parent ion isolation width is 3 m/z units. Fragmentation setting of activation Q = 0.25, activation time = 30 ms, and relative collision energy of 30% were used. vMALDI-LTQ data were searched against a custom data base containing full-length human caspase-7 using an in-house licensed bioinformatics data base search engine system Mascot version 2.2.04 (Matrix Sciences, London, UK) with the no enzyme option selected. Purified active caspase-7 was incubated with calpain-1 (9.0 units) and 20 mm CaCl2 at 30 °C for 30 min. Following addition of Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), samples were separated on a 14% Tris-glycine denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and then renatured for 2 h at room temperature in Zymogram Renaturing Buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, and 10 mm DTT. Gel was then incubated for 1 h in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 10 mm DTT, and the fluorescent caspase-7 substrate Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-MCA (100 μm, Peptides International), and caspase activity was visualized at 365 nm using a light source (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Gels were subsequently fixed in a 10% MeOH, 7% acetic acid solution and stained overnight in SYPRO Ruby gel stain (Molecular Probes) to visualize total protein. Previous studies have demonstrated that calpains are activated upstream of caspases in a variety of cell models (14Altznauer F. Conus S. Cavalli A. Folkers G. Simon H.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5947-5957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15Chaitanya G.V. Babu P.P. Neurochem. Res. 2008; 33: 2178-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Wu J. Liu T. Xie J. Xin F. Guo L. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether calpains can directly cleave caspases and the impact of cleavage on caspase activity. In vitro-translated 35S-labeled procaspases were treated with calpain-1 (Fig. 1). Calpain-1 is a ubiquitously expressed calpain family member requiring micromolar Ca2+ levels for activation. A large number of caspases were cleaved by calpain, although the number of cleavage products was distinct for each caspase. Some caspases (caspase-1 and -8) had numerous cleavage products while other caspases (caspase-4, -5, -7, -10, -12, and -13) had one or two defined cleavage products. The remaining caspases tested (caspase-2, -3, -6, and -9) were resistant to calpain cleavage (Fig. 1). Preincubation with calpain-2, which requires millimolar Ca2+ levels for activation, produced the same cleavage patterns (data not shown). Active caspases were also preincubated with calpain-1 to see the effect on activity. The activities of the majority of caspases were unchanged by calpain-1 preincubation (Fig. 2A; n = 3). Interestingly, the activity of caspase-1, one of the caspases that had numerous calpain cleavage products, was reduced by 69% following calpain-1 treatment (Fig. 2B; n = 3; *, p < 0.001). Surprisingly, the activity of active caspase-7 and active caspase-10 increased following calpain-1 pretreatment (Fig. 2C). Caspase-7 activity increased 4-fold (n = 3, ***, p < 0.001) and caspase-10 activity increased 27% (n = 3, **, p < 0.01) (Fig. 2C). A similar increase in caspase-7 activity was also observed following incubation with calpain-2 (data not shown). Additional experiments with active caspase-7 showed that variations in calpain-1 preincubation times (5 min to 1 h) and increases in the amount of calpain added did not further increase caspase-7 activity (data not shown). Calpain-1 pretreatment produced two defined cleavage products and a substantial increase in caspase-7 activity. Therefore, we tested whether calpain-1 could activate procaspase-7 alone, because granzyme B can independently activate procaspase-7 in vitro (5Zhou Q. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). When procaspase-7 was preincubated with calpain-1, caspase-7 was not activated as measured by a DEVD-rhodamine fluorescent substrate (Fig. 3A). As expected, granzyme B incubation alone activated procaspase-7 (Fig. 3A; n = 3, ###, p < 0.001) and calpain-1 and granzyme B co-incubation increased the activity by 2.4-fold (Fig. 3A; n = 3, ***, p < 0.001). When purified caspase-7 without the prodomain (ΔN caspase-7, first 23 amino acid removed) was preincubated with calpain-1 there was also no evidence of calpain-1 independently activating ΔN caspase-7 (Fig. 3B). As with procaspase-7, when ΔN caspase-7 was incubated with granzyme B there was a significant increase in activity (Fig. 3B; n = 3, #, p < 0.05) and co-incubation with granzyme B and calpain-1 led to a 3.3-fold increase in caspase-7 activity relative to preincubation with granzyme B alone (Fig. 3B; n = 3, ***, p < 0.001). From these results it is clear that calpain-1 can only increase the activity of caspase-7 following granzyme B cleavage and activation between the linker of the small and large subunit. To identify the number and size of calpain cleavage products, purified procaspase-7 and ΔN caspase-7 was cleaved with increasing amounts of calpain-1, and protein was visualized with a Coomassie Blue stain (Fig. 4A). Two calpain cleavage products were produced, both smaller than ΔN caspase-7 and caspase-3-cleaved caspase-7 protein. Cleavage appeared to occur sequentially with lower amounts of calpain-1 producing the larger calpain fragment and higher amounts of calpain-1 producing more of the smaller calpain product. To determine which of the two calpain fragments produced are active, zymography of active caspase-7 with and without calpain-1 pretreatment was performed. After running samples on a denaturing gel, caspases were renatured and exposed to a DEVD fluorescently tagged substrate (Ac-DEVD-MCA) to visualize caspase-7 activity. Prior to calpain treatment, the caspase-3-cleaved active product of caspase-7 appeared as a blurry, faint activity band at ∼19 kDa (Fig. 4B). Following calpain-1 treatment, the faint 19-kDa activity band disappeared and a distinct, robust activity band appeared at ∼15 kDa (Fig. 4B). Subsequent SYPRO Ruby staining demonstrated that calpain treatment resulted in the disappearance of caspase-3-cleaved large subunit, p19 and the appearance of p16 and p15 (Fig. 4B, apparent migration on gel). While the larger calpain fragment, p16, appeared to have low activity, relatively equivalent to the activity observed for the caspase-3 fragment, the smaller calpain fragment had robust activity. Quantification of the change in caspase-7 activity intensity normalized to protein levels using densitometry demonstrates that the smaller calpain fragment is 18.4-fold more active than the caspase-3 fragment. Because the smaller, highly active calpain band was also present in the untreated active caspase-7 sample, this suggests that a calpain-like proteolysis may occur in the bacterial system used to make purified active caspase-7. Alternatively, production of a secondary translation product initiated at Met45 may be responsible for this product (9Denault J.B. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34042-34050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Calpain-1 run alone does not have activity (data not shown). In addition, the caspase-3-cleaved fragment and calpain-1-cleaved fragment that was not processed between the large and small subunit was observed around 34 kDa in small quantities (Fig. 4B). Both proteins have low activity levels, suggesting that cleavage between the large and small subunit is necessary for the increase in activity observed with the calpain-1-cleaved large subunit. Next we evaluated if calpain-cleaved caspase-7 cleaves endogenous protein substrates. Cellular lysates were treated with active caspase-7 (0–250 nm) incubated with and without calpain-1. The amount of PARP cleavage, a well-characterized substrate of caspase-7, was quantified using Western blot analysis and densitometry. Calpain-activated caspase-7 resulted in increased levels of cleaved PARP (54.3%) when compared with caspase-7 untreated (29.8%) (Fig. 4C). Because calpain cleavage of caspase-7 increased PARP protein processing, this suggests that calpain-cleaved caspase-7 is active against known caspase-7 substrates. To identify the calpain cleavage sites in caspase-7, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed using active caspase-7 treated with and without calpain-1. Untreated active caspase-7 has two distinct peaks at 12,558 and 19,918 Da, representing the small and large subunit, respectively (Fig. 5A, top graph). When caspase-7 was cleaved with calpain-1, two new peaks at 18,534 and 17,245 Da were observed (Fig. 5A, bottom graph). Expansion of the smaller peak exposed an additional peak very close in size (17,245 and 17,459 Da, Fig. 5A, inset). When calpain-1 was run alone, no peaks below 30 kDa were observed (data not shown). Based on the assumption that cleavage occurs near the N terminus of the large subunit, because the active cysteine is close to the C terminus (Fig. 5B), mass spectrometry masses were used to accurately predict calpain cleavage sites in the large subunit near the N terminus. Protein calculation software predicted that cleavage after Phe-36 would produce an 18,535-Da protein, cleavage after Met-45 would produce a 17,490-Da protein and cleavage after Ser-47 would produce a 17,246-Da protein. The calculated mass of two of these fragments is within 1 Da of the measured mass and the third within 31 Da. Also, two of these cleavage sites are composed of three amino acid sequences, which are predicted calpain cleavage sites (Fig. 5B, LFS and TMR in blue) (20Tompa P. Buzder-Lantos P. Tantos A.

The MALDI-TOF data on calpain-treated caspase-7 samples suggest that cleavage occurs at Phe-36, Met-45, and Ser-47. However, this does not give sequence information. Therefore, analysis was performed on a vMALDI-LTQTM quadrupole linear ion trap of caspase-7 treated with and without calpain. Fig. 6A shows the MS spectra of untreated caspase-7. Upon treatment with calpain is the appearance of a peak at m/z 1450.83 (Fig. 6B). This peak was not present in the untreated caspase-7 sample (Fig. 6A). This peptide was selected for MS/MS analysis to determine the sequence of the cleavage product. As shown in Fig. 6C, the tandem mass spectra of peptide AKPDRSSFVPSLF (m/z 1450.83) corresponds to cleavage at amino acid Phe-36. Calpain cleavage sites are not well conserved and recognition of the substrate depends on the three-dimensional structure of the substrate protein (20Tompa P. Buzder-Lantos P. Tantos A. Farkas A.

We show in vitro and in vivo that this domain initiates p53 degradation by the 20 S proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent fashion. The decay of metabolically labeled p53 follows biphasic kinetics with an immediate fast phase that is ubiquitin-independent and a second slower phase that is ubiquitin-dependent. The 20 S proteasome executes the first phase by default, whereas the second phase requires the 26 S proteasome. p53 N-terminal binding proteins, such as Hdmx, can selectively block the first phase of degradation. Remarkably, γ-irradiation inhibits both p53 decay phases, whereas UV selectively negates the second phase, giving rise to discrete levels of p53 accumulation. Our data of a single protein experiencing double mode degradation mechanisms each with unique kinetics provide the mechanistic basis for programmable protein homeostasis (proteostasis).

It has become apparent that certain proteins are also subjected to proteasomal degradation in a ubiquitin-independent (UI) manner, which at least in vitro is executed by the 20 S proteasome (1Jariel-Encontre I. Bossis G. Piechaczyk M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1786: 153-177PubMed Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome is the catalytic chamber that lacks the two regulatory caps (19 S) that are present in the 26 S proteasome. Without the regulatory domains, proteins cannot be unfolded in an ATP-dependent manner as is the case with the 26 S proteasome. In vitro the 20 S proteasomes degrade proteins that are intrinsically unstructured, whereas structured proteins are not very susceptible to this degradation (2Liu C.W. Corboy M.J. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Science. 2003; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 3Tsvetkov P. Asher G. Reiss V. Shaul Y. Sachs L. Lotem J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 5535-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), suggesting that 20 S proteasomal substrates are naturally intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs). There are many unstructured proteins (disordered) in the genome and even more with unstructured domains. Studies based on various in silico predictors for protein disorder estimate that at least 25% of the sequences in SwissProt contain long disordered regions and that in eukaryotes, this value may be as high as 63% (4Dunker A.K. Obradovic Z. Romero P. Garner E.C. Brown C.J. Genome Inform. Ser. Workshop Genome Inform. 2000; 11: 161-171PubMed Google Scholar). Different prediction methods also suggested that unstructured proteins are more susceptible to degradation (5Gsponer J. Futschik M.E. Teichmann S.A. Babu M.M. Science. 2008; 322: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). An important question is whether the unstructured proteins are subjected to 20 S proteasomal degradation in the cells as well. Supporting this possibility is that at least a fraction of certain proteins is subjected to UI degradation, a process that might be executed by the 20 S proteasome. In a recent study, it was shown that as much as 20% of cellular proteins can undergo 20 S proteasomal degradation (6Baugh J.M. Viktorova E.G. Pilipenko E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 386: 814-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). There are also a growing number of proteins that have been shown to undergo 20 S proteasomal degradation in vitro and in vivo and are subjected to UI degradation (7Asher G. Tsvetkov P. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 8Chen X. Barton L.F. Chi Y. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Additionally, it appears that proteins that have been reported to undergo UI degradation are unstructured or have one or more long unstructured segments. Thus, it is very likely that IUPs are susceptible to degradation by both UD and UI mechanisms. In the emerging field of proteostasis (11Balch W.E. Morimoto R.I. Dillin A. Kelly J.W.

IUPs lacking defined tertiary structure fulfill multiple roles by associating with many partners, as reviewed by Dyson and Wright (13Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3023) Google Scholar). Many key regulators in the cells either are completely unstructured or have large unstructured domains. IUPs may escape 20 S proteasomal degradation when associated with a second protein (14Elliott E. Tsvetkov P. Ginzburg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 37276-37284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J.

Proteins. 2008; 70: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). IκBα, for example, has unstructured domains at the N and C termini (17Sickmeier M. Hamilton J.A. LeGall T. Vacic V. Cortese M.S. Tantos A. Szabo B. Tompa P. Chen J. Uversky V.N. Obradovic Z. Dunker A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the basal turnover of IκBα is regulated by UI degradation (18Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6716-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). IκBα can be degraded by the 20 S proteasome in vitro, and the binding of p65 can prevent IκBα degradation by the 20 S proteasome (19Alvarez-Castelao B. Castaño J.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4797-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Kroll M. Conconi M. Desterro M.J. Marin A. Thomas D. Friguet B. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Rodriguez M.S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1841-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Upon binding to NF-kB, IκBα escapes degradation by default and is stabilized. Under this conditions, IκBα can be destabilized by IκB kinase-mediated phosphorylation followed by ubiquitination and degradation (21O'Dea E.L. Kearns J.D. Hoffmann A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 632-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Mathes E. O'Dea E.L. Hoffmann A. Ghosh G. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). p53 is a tumor suppressor whose cellular level is maintained mostly by the rate of its degradation (23Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5798) Google Scholar). There are two distinct proteasomal degradation pathways of p53, the UD and UI pathways. In the UI pathway, p53 undergoes degradation by the 20 S proteasome (7Asher G. Tsvetkov P. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 24Asher G.

Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4059-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, UI degradation of p53 can be blocked by NQO1, an NADH-regulated enzyme (24Asher G. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13125-13130Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which is in association with the 20 S proteasomes (7Asher G. Tsvetkov P. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In the UD pathway, p53 is ubiquitinated by an E3 ligase such as Mdm2 (26Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3705) Google Scholar, 27Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar), Pirh2 (28Leng R.P. Lin Y. Ma W. Wu H. Lemmers B. Chung S. Parant J.M. Lozano G. Hakem R. Benchimol S. Cell. 2003; 112: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), or COP1 (29Dornan D. Wertz I. Shimizu H. Arnott D. Frantz G.D. Dowd P. O'Rourke K. Koeppen H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 429: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), and following this ubiquitination, p53 is recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Mdm2, the most studied p53 E3 ligase, binds p53 at the N terminus, resulting in the ubiquitination of the C terminus of p53. Hdmx is a paralog of Mdm2, and although it shares high sequence and structural homology with Mdm2, it does not have E3 ligase activity and thus cannot target p53 for degradation. Hdmx has been shown to stabilize p53 on the protein level (30Sharp D.A. Kratowicz S.A. Sank M.J. George D.L. J. Biol.

However, despite the ability of Hdmx to stabilize p53, Hdmx still acts as a repressor of p53 because, like Mdm2, the binding of Hdmx to the N terminus of p53 prevents its transcription activation (34Finch R.A. Donoviel D.B. Potter D. Shi M. Fan A. Freed D.D. Wang C.Y. Zambrowicz B.P. Ramirez-Solis R. Sands A.T. Zhang N. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3221-3225PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gilkes D.M. Chen L. Chen J.

Thus, Hdmx in some cases has a conflicting activity: increasing p53 level on one hand and inhibiting p53 activity on the other hand. p53 is highly unstructured at the N and C termini (38Bell S. Klein C. Müller L. Hansen S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Our goal was to determine whether one of these unstructured domains is responsible for p53 susceptibility to UI 20 S proteasomal degradation. The N terminus of p53 contains the transcription activation domains and the binding site for Mdm2/Hdmx (residues 1–42), the second transcription activation domain, and the proline-rich domain (residues 64–92), whereas the C terminus contains the oligomerization domain (residues 307–355) and three nuclear localization sequence motifs (residues 356–393). The unstructured N terminus transcription activation domain of p53 generates a large number of protein-protein interactions and is subjected to multiple modifications (39Joerger A.C. Fersht A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 557-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 40Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 41Braithwaite A.W. Del Sal G. Lu X. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 984-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We report here that this domain is responsible for the susceptibility of p53 to 20 S proteasomal degradation in vitro and in vivo. Thus, cellular p53 level is regulated by a double mode degradation mechanism, namely 26 S proteasomal, E3 ligase-mediated UD degradation and 20 S proteasomal degradation by default. We demonstrate that p53 undergoes biphasic decay kinetics and further correlate the biphasic kinetics curve with the UI (20 S proteasome) and UD degradation processes. Remarkably, utilizing Hdmx as a model protein, we show that N terminus-binding proteins rescue p53 from the first UI degradation phase, exemplifying the capacity of the cell to differentially regulate the two pathways of degradation and control p53 homeostasis (proteostasis). Furthermore, the fact that p53 is subjected to two distinct degradation pathways, each with specific kinetics, permits programmable p53 discrete steady state levels tailored to cope with different types of stress. The plasmids used are as follows: pRc/CMV p53 encoding wild-type human p53, pcDNA3.1 WT p53, 1–363, 1–312, 40–393(Δ40), 97-393(Δ97), all with an HA tag at the C terminus pcDNA3.1 Hdmx-HA and Mdm2. Lentiviral vectors with shRNAmir against 26 S proteasome subunit Rpn2 and control shRNAmir were purchased from Open Biosystems. Transducing lentivirus particles were produced according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were collected and homogenized in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 mm sucrose. The extract was then subjected to centrifugation: first 1000 × g for 5 min and then 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was taken and subjected to ultracentrifugation for 16 h at 100,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended and loaded on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel using the protocol previously described (42Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein mix was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.125 m Tris-HCl), heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to cellulose nitrate 0.45-mm membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The antibodies used were: monoclonal DO-1, 1801, 421 anti-HA (Sigma), and anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-linked Goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Signals were detected using the Ez-ECL kit (Biological Industries). The cell lines used were as follows: HCT116, p53 null HCT116 cells, A31N-ts20 BALB/c mouse cell line that harbors a temperature-sensitive E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (43Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), MEFs p53−/− Mdm2−/− (kindly provided by Prof. Oren from the Weizmann Institute of Science), and NIH3T3 cells. The cells were grown as described previously (24Asher G. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13125-13130Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed when cells reached 80–90% confluence. p53 null HCT116 were transfected with JetPEI (PolyPlus Transfection). A31N-ts20 and MEFs p53−/− Mdm2−/− cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 20 S proteasomes were purified from mice livers as described previously (7Asher G. Tsvetkov P. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were incubated with the 20 S proteasomes in degradation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) at 37 °C for up to 60 min. The degradation reaction was stopped with the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. p53 lacking amino acids 363–393 (HA-p53 C30), his-p53C-terminus domain of p53 (amino acids 311–393) and wild-type p53 were previously described (44Jayaraman J.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The p53ΔN22 and p53ΔN97 proteins used were constructed and expressed by similar means (46Cain C. Miller S. Ahn J. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39944-39953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Infection and purification of p53 proteins from insect cells was performed as before (45Jayaraman L. Freulich E. Prives C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In vitro translation was performed using the TnT® quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, WI) and plasmids mentioned above. 24 h after seeding or transfection, cells were starved in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with dialyzed serum (Met−) (Biological industries) for 30 min. Cells were then collected, pelleted, and resuspended in Met− and then labeled with prewarmed [35S]Met (10 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences), reaching a final concentration of 0.2 mCi/ml for different times as mentioned above (1–60 min) (in the NIH 3T3 experiments, cells were not starved for methionine before labeling with [35S]Met). 50 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) was added 20 min before labeling where indicated. The cells were then pelleted, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in prewarmed medium containing unlabeled Met (2%) Met+. The cells were then aliquoted into 0.5 ml of prewarmed Met+ and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Cells were pelleted and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (7Asher G. Tsvetkov P. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA, anti-p53 (1801), or anti-p53 (421) antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in radioimmune precipitation buffer and run on SDS-PAGE, and radioactivity present in individual bands was determined using the Fuji Bas2500 phosphorimaging device. Cycloheximide experiments were done as described previously (47Levy D. Adamovich Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 350-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The data analysis and the mathematical fits were done utilizing the cftool in MATLAB program. NIH 3T3 cells were UV- (50 J/m2) or γ-irradiated (6 grays). After 30 min, cells were collected, pelleted, and resuspended in M− containing [35S]Met (10 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Cells were then collected and treated as described above. The 20 S proteasome preferentially degrades IUPs (2Liu C.W. Corboy M.J. DeMartino G.N. Thomas P.J. Science. 2003; 299: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 3Tsvetkov P. Asher G. Reiss V. Shaul Y. Sachs L. Lotem J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 5535-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). p53 is intrinsically unstructured at both the N terminus and the C terminus (38Bell S. Klein C. Müller L. Hansen S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 917-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This led us to explore whether these regions of p53 are responsible for its susceptibility to 20 S proteasomal degradation. To address this question, we utilized in vitro translated or baculovirus-expressed and -purified WT and mutant p53 proteins that lacked sequences at either the N terminus or the C terminus of the protein and used 20 S proteasomes purified from mouse livers as described previously (7Asher G. Tsvetkov P. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). p53 was efficiently degraded by the 20 S proteasome in vitro, exhibiting almost complete degradation within 30 min (Fig. 1A). The ΔC30 p53 truncation mutant, missing the last 30 amino acids, was degraded to the same extent as the WT. The C terminus region in isolation CT-(311–393) was completely degraded by the 20 S proteasome, confirming its unstructured nature (Fig. 1B). In vitro synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled C terminus deletions of p53 were also susceptible to 20 S proteasomal degradation just as the wild-type protein (Fig. 1G), suggesting that the C terminus is not responsible for the susceptibility of p53 to 20 S proteasomal degradation. In contrast, the ΔN97p53-(97–393) was resistant to 20 S proteasomal degradation (Fig. 1C). To further narrow down the region, we utilized N-terminally deleted ΔN22p53-(22–393). In contrast to ΔN97, the WT and ΔN22p53 were completely degraded (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained with in vitro synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled p53 truncations (Fig. 1, E and F). Both ΔN40p53-(40–393) and ΔNPRp53-(Δ60–102) were degraded by the 20 S proteasome (Fig. 1F), whereas the ΔN97p53 was resistant to this degradation (Fig. 1, E and F). The degradation experiments were performed at least three times, and the results indicated that only the ΔN97 is resistant to degradation by the 20 S proteasome (Fig. 1H), suggesting that an unstructured domain at the N terminus of p53 is crucial for its susceptibility to 20 S proteasomal degradation. The role of the N terminus in the susceptibility of p53 to 20 S proteasomal degradation may suggest that p53 degradation is initiated at the N terminus. To test this possibility, we examined the p53 partial degradation products by the 20 S proteasome using antibodies specific for different epitopes of p53 (Fig. 2A). When probing a partial p53 digest using an antibody recognizing the N terminus (DO-1, recognizing amino acids 21–25), no new fragments were detected after the degradation. Only one fragment was detected by the 1801 antibody (amino acids 46–55), whereas several fragments were detected by the C-terminal 421 antibody (amino acids 371–380) (Fig. 2B). This pattern of fragments is best explained by the assumption that the degradation of p53 by the 20 S proteasome is initiated from the N terminus. We have previously shown that binding of a protein can protect a client substrate protein from 20 S proteasomal degradation (7Asher G. Tsvetkov P. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 16Tsvetkov P. Asher G. Paz A. Reuven N. Sussman J.L. Silman I. Shaul Y. Proteins. 2008; 70: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To see whether this also holds for p53, we subjected p53 to 20 S degradation in the presence of specific antibodies. The binding of DO-1 antibody to the N terminus prevented p53 degradation, whereas the binding of 421 to the C terminus had no effect (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that binding of proteins to the N terminus of p53 may protect p53 in this degradation pathway. Mdm2 and Hdmx (Hdm4) share high sequence resemblance and have been both shown to bind p53 at the unstructured N terminus, inducing a best fit structure (48Popowicz G.M. Czarna A. Rothweiler U. Szwagierczak A. Krajewski M. Weber L. Holak T.A. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2386-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 49Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar). We incubated p53 with and without Mdm2/Hdmx and subjected these proteins to 20 S degradation. Both of these proteins could protect p53 from degradation in this in vitro system (Fig. 2D), further strengthening the possibility that binding to the unstructured N terminus of p53 rescues p53 from 20 S degradation. Previous studies have shown that p53 is susceptible to degradation by both ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent mechanisms. However, it was not clear how each mechanism contributes to the overall degradation of p53 and to the kinetics of this degradation. To address this problem, we used a mathematical approach to analyze the decay kinetics of p53. The basic model of p53 degradation is that p53 is synthesized (S) and then degraded by the ubiquitin system (Ks) (Fig. 3A). In this case, the equation for p53 levels would be as shown in Equation 1, and the solution of this equation when synthesis is stopped (S = 0 and p53[0] = A0) is described in Equation 2 p53′[t]=S-Ksp53[t](Eq. 1) [p53]=A0e-Kst(Eq. 2) If applying Ln to Equation 2, a linear monophasic decay curve is expected with the slope of −Ks from which the half-life of the protein can be calculated (t½ = Ln(2)/Ks). On the other hand, our in vitro data have shown that p53 is susceptible to degradation by the 20 S proteasome, but binding to another protein can prevent this degradation. These results lead to a model in which free p53, such as newly synthesized p53 that has not yet formed a complex with a partner, can undergo fast degradation by the 20 S proteasome (Kf) or form a functional complex at the rate of B (Fig. 3B). Once in a complex, p53 can only be degraded by the ubiquitin system at the rate of Ks. Under these assumptions, the equations that would describe the behavior of the two forms of p53, the free form (f(t)) and the form in a complex (c(t)), are described in Equations 3 and 4 respectively. f′(t)=S-(B+Kf)f(t)(Eq. 3) C′(t)=Bf(t)-KSC(t)(Eq. 4) The solution of these equations combined ([p53] = c(t)+f(t)) when synthesis is stopped (S = 0, f(0) = F0, and c(0) = C0) is described in Equation 5 [p53]=F0(Kf-Ks)B+Kf-Kse-(B+Kf)t+B(C0+F0)+C0(Kf-Ks)B+Kf-Ke-Kst(Eq. 5) With these two models at hand, we looked at the decay curve of endogenous p53 after a pulse-chase experiment with 5-min labeling with [35S]methionine. We fitted to the experimental data the best fit for a single exponent function (monophasic) and double exponent function (biphasic) (supplemental Table 1). The two-exponent fit was much better, as can be visualized (Fig. 3C). A monophasic curve cannot encompass the initial fast decay and the slower later decay to such an extent as the two-exponent function. To emphasize the better fit of the two-exponent function, we applied Ln to the experimental data and the two fits (Fig. 3D). A biphasic degradation mode better explains the experimental data. To further validate that indeed there is biphasic degradation in cells, we utilized another approach whereby the decay curve of endogenous p53 was examined following different labeling times. If indeed the first phase of degradation is fast, longer labeling of a protein will result in the minimization of the relative contribution of the fast phase in the overall decay kinetics, whereas the second slow phase should not be affected. As expected, with long 30-min labeling, the relative contribution of the fast phase in overall decay kinetics became minor, whereas the second phase remained the same (Fig. 3E). Specifically, when looking only at the first phase of degradation, in the 5-min pulse, the kinetics is k = −0.034 (R2 = 0.99 t½ = 20 min), and with the 30-min pulse, the k = −0.024 (R2 = 0.99 t½ = 29 min) (Fig. 3F). This kinetics is consistent with the biphasic degradation of p53 in these cells with the first phase being faster than the second. To quantify p53 decay, we performed a pulse-chase experiment with a minimal pulse of 1 min and a longer pulse of 30 min (Fig. 4A). Analyzing the decay of p53 after applying Ln revealed that p53 exhibited biphasic degradation in HCT116 cells and that the first phase decreased when the pulse was longer (Fig. 4A). This degradation is proteasomal and was completely inhibited by MG132, an inhibitor of the proteasome (Fig. 4B). Given the susceptibility of the free p53 N terminus to 20 S proteasomal degradation, we reasoned that in the cells, the newly synthesized p53 is at higher risk of degradation by this pathway, accounting for the first fast decay phase. To test our hypothesis, we knocked down the Rpn2 subunit of the 19 S proteasome cap to prevent the assembly of 26 S proteasomes, whereas"

Our results show that YafO inhibits protein synthesis but not DNA or RNA synthesis. The in vivo [35S]methionine incorporation was inhibited within 5 min after YafO induction. In in vivo primer extension experiments with two different mRNAs, the specific cleavage bands appeared 11–13 bases downstream of the initiation codon, AUG, 2.5 min after the induction of YafO. An identical band was also detected in in vitro toeprinting experiments when YafO was added to the reaction mixture containing 70 S ribosomes and the same mRNAs even in the absence of tRNAfMet. Notably, this band was not detected in the presence of YafO alone, indicating that YafO by itself does not have endoribonuclease activity under the conditions used. The full-length mRNAs almost completely disappeared 30 min after YafO induction in in vivo primer extension experiments, consistent with Northern blotting analysis. Over 84% of [35S]methionine-tRNAfMet was released from the translation initiation complex at 5.43 μm YafO in vitro. We demonstrated that the 70 S ribosome peak significantly increased upon YafO induction, and when the 70 S ribosomes dissociated into 50 and 30 S subunits, YafO was found to be associated with 50 S subunits. These results demonstrate that YafO is a ribosome-dependent mRNA interferase inhibiting protein synthesis.

These results demonstrate that YafO is a ribosome-dependent mRNA interferase inhibiting protein synthesis. YafO is one of the toxins (1Brown J.M. Shaw K.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6600-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) encoded by the Escherichia coli genome. It is co-expressed with YafN, its cognate antitoxin. It has been shown that dinB, yafN, yafO, and yafP are present in the same operon (2McKenzie G.J. Magner D.B. Lee P.L. Rosenberg S.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3972-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Under UV irradiation, the transcription level of YafO exhibits a 4-fold increase (3Courcelle J. Khodursky A. Peter B. Brown P.O. Hanawalt P.C. Genetics. 2001; 158: 41-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that YafO may be involved in an SOS reaction. MazF and RelE are extensively studied toxin-antitoxin toxins in E. coli. Interestingly, RelE by itself has no endoribonuclease activity (4Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2003; 112: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and has been demonstrated to be a ribosome-associated factor that stimulates the endogenous ribonuclease activity of ribosomes (5Hayes C.S. Sauer R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 903-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MazF is a ribosome-independent endoribonuclease that cleaves mRNAs specifically at ACA sequences and is thus termed an mRNA interferase (6Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). ChpBK encoded by the E. coli genome was also found to be another mRNA interferase specifically cleaving mRNAs at UAC sequences (7Zhang Y. Zhu L. Zhang J. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26080-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). YoeB was found to be a ribosome-dependent mRNA interferase. It binds to the 50 S ribosomal subunit in 70 S ribosomes interacting with the A site leading to mRNA cleavage. As a result, translation initiation is effectively inhibited (8Zhang Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6627-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we demonstrate that YafO is also a 50 S ribosome-associated mRNA interferase that inhibits protein synthesis. The in vivo primer extension experiments with two different mRNAs revealed a major cleavage band 11–13 bases downstream of the initiation codon 2.5 min after YafO induction. An identical band was also detected in in vitro toeprinting experiments when YafO was added to the reaction mixtures containing 70 S ribosomes and the same mRNAs even in the absence of initiator tRNAfMet. Notably these cleavage bands were not observed when YafO was incubated with mRNA in the absence of ribosomes. It should be noted that a nonsense mutation in the second codon did not significantly affect YafO-mediated ribosome-dependent mRNA interferase activity. Over 84% of [35S]methionine-tRNAfMet was released from the translation initiation complex at 5.43 μm YafO in vitro. These results indicate that YafO associates with 50 S subunits in 70 S ribosomes to effectively inhibit protein synthesis by cleaving mRNAs 11–13 bases downstream of the initiation codon. Thus, YafO is a ribosome-dependent mRNA interferase inhibiting protein synthesis. E. coli BL21(DE3), BW25113 (ΔaraBAD) (9Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11305) Google Scholar), and MRE600 (10Swaney S.M. Aoki H. Ganoza M.C. Shinabarger D.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3251-3255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used. The yafN-yafO operon was amplified by PCR using E. coli genomic DNA as template and cloned into the NdeI-XhoI sites of pET21c (Novagen). This construction created an in-frame translation fusion with a His6 tag at the yafO C-terminal end. The plasmid was designated as pET21c-YafN-YafO-His6. The yafO gene was cloned into both pBAD30 and pBAD33, creating pBAD30-YafO and pBAD33-YafO, respectively, to tightly regulate yafO expression by the addition of arabinose (0.2%). The ompA gene fragment was cloned into pBAD30, creating pBAD30-ompA. The yafN gene was cloned into pCold-TF (Trigger factor) (Takara) creating pCold-TF-YafN. A 70-ml culture of E. coli BW25113 containing the pBAD30-YafO plasmid was grown at 37 °C in M9 medium with 0.5% glycerol (no glucose) and all the amino acids except for methionine and cysteine (1 mm each). When the A600 of the culture reached 0.4, arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2%. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the cells were treated with 1% toluene (11Halegoua S. Hirashima A. Sekizawa J. Inouye M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 69: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Halegoua S. Hirashima A. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 183-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using toluene-treated cells, protein synthesis was carried out with [35S]methionine as described previously (11Halegoua S. Hirashima A.

Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 183-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The toluene-treated cells were washed once with 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at room temperature, then resuspended into the same buffer to examine DNA synthesis using [α-32P]dCTP as described previously (13Moses R.E. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1970; 67: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). For assaying RNA synthesis, the toluene-treated cells were washed once with 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) at room temperature and then resuspended into the same buffer to measure [α-32P]UTP incorporation into RNA as described previously (14Peterson R.L.

E. coli BW25113 cells containing pBAD30-YafO were grown in M9 medium with 0.5% glycerol (no glucose) and all the amino acids except for methionine and cysteine (1 mm each). When the A600 value of the culture reached 0.4, arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2% to induce YafO expression. Cell cultures (0.6 ml) were taken at the time intervals indicated in Fig. 1F and mixed with 30 μCi of [35S]methionine. After 1 min of incubation at 37 °C, the rate of protein synthesis was determined as described previously (6Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE analysis of the total cellular protein synthesis, the samples were removed from the [35S]methionine incorporation reaction mixture (500 μl) at the time intervals indicated in Fig. 1F and added into chilled test tubes containing 100 μg/ml each of nonradioactive methionine and cysteine. The cell pellets collected by centrifugation were dissolved into 50 μl of loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. YafO-His6-tagged at the C-terminal end was purified from strain BL21(DE3) carrying pET-21c-YafN-YafO. The cell pellets were dissolved in 6 m guanidine-HCl. Denatured YafO-His6 was first trapped on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and then refolded by step-by-step dialysis. TF-YafN tagged at the N-terminal end was purified from strain BL21(DE3) carrying pCold-TF-YafN with the use of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). Prokaryotic cell-free protein synthesis was carried out with an E. coli T7 S30 extract system (Promega). The reaction mixture consisted of 10 μl of S30 premix, 7.5 μl of S30 extract, and 2.5 μl of an amino acid mixture (1 mm each of all amino acids except methionine), 1 μl of [35S]methionine, and different amounts of YafO-His6 and TF-YafN in a final volume of 29 μl. The different amounts of YafO-His6 and TF-YafN were preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C before the assay was started by adding 1 μl of pET-11a-MazG plasmid-DNA (0.16 μg/μl) (16Zhang J. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5323-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed for 1.5 h at 37 °C, and the proteins were then precipitated with acetone and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. 70 S ribosomes were prepared from E. coli MRE 600 as described previously (17Aoki H.

Bacterial cells (2 g) were suspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NH4Cl, and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The cells were lysed by French Press. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation two times at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C with a Beckman 50Ti rotor. The supernatant (three-fourths volume from the top) was then layered over an equal volume of 1.1 m sucrose in buffer B (buffer A containing 0.5 m NH4Cl) and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 15 h at 4 °C with a Beckman 50Ti rotor. After washing with buffer A, the ribosome pellets were resuspended in buffer A and applied to a linear 5–40% (w/v) sucrose gradient prepared in buffer A and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C with a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. The gradients were fractionated, and the 70 S ribosome fractions were pooled and pelleted at 45,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C with a Beckman 50Ti rotor. The 70 S ribosome pellets were then resuspended in buffer A and stored at −80 °C. For polysome profile analysis, the cells containing the pBAD30-YafO plasmid were grown at 37 °C in 150 ml of LB medium, and at an A600 of 0.6, arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2%. After 10 min of induction, chloramphenicol was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. The extracts were prepared using liquid nitrogen, freezing, and thawing four times. Approximately 10 A260 units of the lysate were layered onto a 5–40% sucrose gradient in buffer A (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 60 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. The gradients were analyzed with continuous monitoring at 254 nm. To analyze a 50 and 30 S ribosome profile, another 10 A260 units of lysates as prepared above were dialyzed overnight against buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 60 mm NH4Cl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) (dialysis buffer was changed once), layered onto 5–40% sucrose gradients in buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 60 mm NH4Cl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and then centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. The gradients were analyzed with continuous monitoring at 254 nm. For primer extension analysis of mRNA cleavage sites in vivo, total RNAs were extracted from the E. coli BW25113 cells containing pBAD30-YafO at different time points as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4. Primer extension was carried out using different primers as described previously (6Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Toeprinting was carried out as described previously (20Moll I. Bläsi U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. The mixture for primer-template annealing containing mRNA and 32P end-labeled DNA primer was incubated at 70 °C for 5 min and then cooled slowly to room temperature. The ribosome-binding mixture contained 2 μl of 10× buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 100 mm MgCl2, 600 mm NH4Cl, and 60 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), different amounts of YafO-His6, 0.375 mm dNTP, 0.05 μm 70 S ribosomal subunits, 1 μm tRNAfMet, and 2 μl of the annealing mixture in a final volume of 20 μl. The final mRNA concentration was 0.035 μm. This ribosome-binding mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and then reverse transcriptase (2 units) was added. The cDNA synthesis was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 12 μl of the sequencing loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol EF). The sample was incubated at 90 °C for 5 min prior to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The ompA and ompF mRNAs were synthesized in vitro from their individual DNA fragments, each containing a T7 promoter and a part of their opening reading frames, using T7 RNA polymerase. These approximate 200-bp DNA fragments for ompA (248 bp) and ompF (224 bp), both of which had the initiation codon at the center, were amplified by PCR using appropriate primers with chromosome DNA as templates. The 5′-end primers for ompA and ompF contained the T7 promoter sequence. E. coli BW25113 containing pBAD30-YafO was grown at 37 °C in LB medium. When the A600 value reached 0.6, arabinose was added to a final concentration of 0.2%. The samples were taken at different intervals as indicated in Fig. 3. Total RNAs were isolated using the hot phenol method as described previously (21Sarmientos P. Sylvester J.E. Contente S. Cashel M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1337-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously (22Baker K.E. Mackie G.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out with the ompA mRNA that was used for the toeprinting experiments. The reaction buffer used was buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NH4Cl, and 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol). 70 S ribosomes (1 pmol) were first incubated with the ompA mRNA (0.7 pmol) and [35S]methionine-tRNAfMet (40 pmol) for 10 min at 37 °C, and then different amounts of YafO were added in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. The samples were incubated for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were applied to nitrocellulose filters (Millpore; 0.45 μm hemagglutinin), which were washed twice with 2 ml of buffer A before measuring the radioactivity. [35S]methionine-tRNAfMet was synthesized in a buffer containing 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3 mm ATP, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 30 mm KOAc, 350 μCi of [35S]methionine, and 62.3 μm tRNAfMet (Sigma) using aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Sigma). To identify the cellular function(s) inhibited by YafO, a cell-free system was prepared from E. coli BW25113 cells carrying the arabinose-inducible pBAD30-YafO vector. The cells were permeabilized by toluene treatment (11Halegoua S. Hirashima A. Sekizawa J. Inouye M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 69: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Halegoua S. Hirashima A. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 183-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-dependent [35S]methionine incorporation was completely inhibited when cells were preincubated for 10 min in the presence of arabinose before toluene treatment (Fig. 1A), whereas the incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP (Fig. 1B) and [α-32P]UTP (Fig. 1C) was not significantly affected under similar conditions (13Moses R.E. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1970; 67: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 14Peterson R.L. Radcliffe C.W. Pace N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 107: 585-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that YafO inhibits protein synthesis, but not DNA replication or RNA synthesis. Notably, cell growth was completely inhibited almost immediately after the addition of arabinose (Fig. 1D). The in vivo incorporation of [35S]methionine was also almost completely inhibited within 5 min after YafO induction (Fig. 1, E and F). Next, we examined the effect of purified YafO on E. coli cell-free protein synthesis. YafO-His6 was purified from cells co-expressing both YafN and YafO-His6 as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2A). The synthesis of MazG protein (30 kDa) (16Zhang J. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5323-5329Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) from plasmid pET-11a-MazG was tested at 37 °C for 1 h in the absence and the presence of YafO-His6 using an E. coli T7 S30 extract system (Promega) (Fig. 2B). MazG synthesis was almost completely blocked at a YafO-His6 concentration of 8.0 μm. We next tested the effect of YafN antitoxin on the YafO-mediated inhibition of MazG synthesis. YafN was purified as a fusion protein with trigger factor (TF) 2The abbreviations used are: TFtrigger factorTPtoeprinting. as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The addition of TF-YafN rescued MazG synthesis (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Importantly, YafO-His6 (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3) did not cleave RNA by itself in contrast to MazF-His6 (Fig. 2C, lane 4), which is a known ribosome-independent endoribonuclease that cleaves mRNAs specifically at ACA sequences (6Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). trigger factor toeprinting. The induction of YafO significantly reduced the stability of cellular mRNAs because the full-length ompA and ompF mRNAs very quickly disappeared within 10 min after YafO induction (Fig. 3A). It should be noted that the 23 and 16 S rRNA were stable even 30 min after YafO induction (Fig. 3B). As shown above, cellular mRNAs were degraded upon induction of YafO. Therefore we attempted to identify the cleavage sites of the chromosomally encoded ompA and ompF mRNAs by primer extension experiments. For this purpose, total RNAs were extracted from E. coli BW25113 cells harboring pBAD30-YafO at different time intervals after the induction of YafO. The primer extension analyses of ompA (Fig. 4A) and ompF mRNAs (Fig. 4B) demonstrated that the distinct major bands corresponding to the specific cleavage sites in each mRNA appeared 2.5 min after YafO induction (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 2). The band intensities for ompA (Fig. 4A) further increased from 2.5 to 20 min after YafO induction. Interestingly, in both cases, the major bands resulted from the cleavage of the mRNAs downstream of AUG. Most notably, no other bands were observed in the 5′-untranslated region, suggesting that YafO may function only when it associates with the ribosomal translation machine. It is interesting to note that the amount of the full-length ompA and ompF mRNAs gradually decreased (Fig. 4, A and B), consistent with the Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3A). Next, we examined whether similar cleavage sites of ompA and ompF mRNAs are observed in vitro by the toeprinting (TP) experiments using YoeB as a control (20Moll I. Bläsi U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis of the mRNAs alone yielded the full-length bands (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 1). The addition of YafO or YoeB alone did not result in the formation of new bands, indicating that YafO or YoeB by itself has no endoribonuclease activity under the condition used (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). When 70 S ribosomes and initiator tRNAfMet were added to the reaction mixtures, a typical toeprinting band TP(r) downstream of the initiation codon appeared (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 10, as indicated by black dots). On the other hand, when either YafO-His6 or YoeB was added together with 70 S ribosomes and initiator tRNAfMet, a new band, TP(O) (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 12, shown by an asterisk) or TP(Y) (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 11), appeared in both cases. Notably, the TP(Y) band is identical to that with YoeB (8Zhang Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6627-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TP(O) was formed one base downstream of TP(r). It should be noted that both the TP(O) and TP(r) bands were observed only in the presence of 70 S ribosomes and initiator tRNAfMet (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 12 and 10). Note that the TP(O) band originated as a result of mRNA cleavage and not toeprinting as described below. Next, we tested whether the TP(O) and TP(r) bands resulted from the cleavage of mRNAs using ompA and ompF mRNAs. These mRNAs were first preincubated without (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 5) or with YafO (Fig. 6, A and B, lanes 7) in the presence of 70 S ribosomes and initiator tRNAfMet. RNAs were then phenol-extracted and used for primer extension as shown in Fig. 6 (A and B, lanes 6 and 8). The TP(O) band was still observed after phenol extraction together with the full-length mRNAs (compare lanes 7 and 8 in Fig. 6, A and B, shown by asterisks), indicating that the TP(O) band resulted from at least partial cleavage of the ompA and ompF mRNAs. In contrast, the TP(r) band disappeared after phenol extraction (compare lanes 5 and 6 in Fig. 6, A and B, shown by black dots), indicating that this band was not due to mRNA cleavage but was caused by ribosome binding. It is important to note that the mRNAs were cleaved downstream of the translation initiation codon only in the presence of ribosomes, initiator tRNAfMet, and YafO, but not in the presence of YafO alone. Next we examined whether the initiator tRNAfMet is required for binding of mRNA to 70 S ribosomes in the presence of YafO. Intriguingly, the ompA and ompF mRNAs were able to bind to 70 S ribosomes even in the absence of tRNAfMet if YafO was included in the reaction, yielding identical toeprinting bands (compare lanes 9 with 10 in Fig. 5, A and B). Importantly, these TP(O) bands produced in the absence of tRNAfMet were also due to mRNA cleavage (compare lanes 3 with lanes 4 in Fig. 6, A and B). It should be noted that in the absence of YafO, the addition of tRNAfMet was required for the stable binding of the ompA and ompF mRNAs to 70 S ribosomes (compare lanes 10 with lanes 7 in Fig. 5, A and B; the toeprinting in lane 10 was carried out in the presence of tRNAfMet, whereas that in lane 7 was performed in the absence of tRNAfMet). The addition of YafO alone (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 3), tRNAfMet alone (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 4), or YafO plus tRNAfMet (Fig. 5, A and B, lanes 6) did not yield any toeprinting bands either at the TP(O) or at the TP(r) position. These results suggest that YafO-mediated mRNA cleavage does not require RNAfMet, which is similar to YoeB (compare lanes 7 with lanes 8 in Fig. 5). To examine whether the translation initiation complex is stable after YafO is added, we carried out an experiment to examine whether [35S]methionine-tRNAfMet is released from ribosomes when YafO is added. [35S]Methionine-tRNAfMet was synthesized and used for its complex formation with 70 S ribosomes and mRNA in the presence and the absence of YafO under the same condition used for the toeprinting experiment in Fig. 5A. As shown in Fig. 7A, because the amount of YafO added in the reaction mixture was reduced (from lane 3 to lane 11), the intensity of TP(O) bands are progressively reduced, whereas the intensity of the full-length bands increased gradually. It should be noted even though the TP(O) band (Fig. 7A, lane 3 indicated by an asterisk) is in the identical position to the TP(r) band (Fig. 7A, lane 2, indicated by a black dot), the TP(O) band is produced by mRNA cleavage (Fig. 7B, lane 6), whereas the TP(r) band is due to ribosome binding to mRNA (Fig. 7B, lane 4). Next, we tested whether tRNAfMet bound to the ribosomes is displaced with YafO under the same condition used in Fig. 7A. For this purpose, [35S]methionine-tRNAfMet was first incubated with 70 S ribosomes and mRNA at 37 °C for 10 min, and then different amounts of YafO were added as in Fig. 7A. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for another 10 min and then applied to nitrocellulose filters (Millpore; 0.45 μm hemagglutinin). The filters were washed twice with 2 ml of buffer A before measuring the radioactivity that was retained on the filters. As shown in Fig. 7C, [35S]methionine-tRNAfMet was displaced in a YafO concentration-dependent manner. Over 84% of [35S]methionine-tRNAfMet was released at 5.43 μm YafO (the ratio of YafO to used ribosome was 100:1). This result suggests that the translation initiation complex is not stable after YafO is added. It should be noted that the stability of binding of initiator tRNA to 70 S ribosomes is known to be coupled to that of mRNA. Therefore if mRNA is cleaved, the binding of mRNA to 70 S ribosomes should be reduced, which in turn likely destabilizes initiator tRNA binding (8Zhang Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6627-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To examine whether the first peptide bond formation is required for YafO-mediated mRNA cleavage activity, we created a nonsense mutation on the second codon on the ompA gene. The wild-type or mutated pBAD30-ompA plasmids (Fig. 8) were then co-transformed with pBAD33-YafO into ΔompA BW25113 cells. Total RNAs were extracted at different time points as shown in Fig. 8 (B and C) after ompA and yafO were induced by the addition of 0.2% arabinose. An in vivo primer extension experiment was carried out using the same primer used in Fig. 4A. As shown in Fig. 8 (B and C), the cleavage pattern of the wild-type ompA mRNA was identical to that of the mutant ompA mRNA containing the nonsense mutation, indicating that the inability to form the first peptide bond does not affect YafO-mediated ribosome-dependent mRNA interferase activity. It should be noted that the cleavage band did not appear when YafO was not induced (Fig. 8B, lane 1). It appears that the mRNA interferase activity is weaker in the mRNA carrying the nonsense mutation than that in wild-type ompA mRNA (Fig. 8, compare B with C). This may be due to the weaker affinity of ribosomes to mRNA with nonsense mutations. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism. Because YafO binds to the translation initiation complex (Fig. 5), we examined whether YafO affects the polysome profiles and also whether it specifically associates with one of the ribosomal subunits. When the polysome pattern of E. coli BW25113 cells carrying the pBAD-YafO plasmid was analyzed by sucrose density gradient at 10 min after induction of YafO by arabinose, a significant increase in the 70 S ribosomal fraction was observed without a change in the 30 and 50 S ribosomal profiles (Fig. 9, compare B with A). Western blotting analysis showed that the majority of YafO was associated with both 70 S ribosome and 50 S ribosome fractions, but not with the 30 S ribosome fraction (Fig. 9B). Cell lysates were prepared in 0.5 mm Mg2+ to dissociate 70 S ribosomes to 50 and 30 S ribosomes and analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 9C). The majority of YafO was detected in the 50 S ribosome fraction, suggesting that YafO is a 50 S ribosome-associating protein. It should be noted there is essentially no free YafO in Fig. 9B, suggesting that YafO may bind more tightly to 50 and 70 S ribosomes. In the present study, we demonstrated that YafO is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis. Upon YafO induction, [35S]methionine incorporation into cellular proteins abruptly stopped after 5 min (Fig. 1, E and F), and the full-length cellular mRNAs rapidly disappeared (Fig. 3A). It is important to note that to avoid artifacts we carried out in vivo primer extension experiments using chromosomally encoded mRNAs as targets rather than mRNAs encoded by genes cloned in a multi-copy plasmid. Interestingly, both the mRNAs tested (ompA and ompF) were detected either as their corresponding full-length mRNAs or as a product cleaved downstream of the initiation codon (Fig. 4). Notably, in the two mRNAs, no other cleavage bands were detected upstream of the initiation codon, suggesting that the observed cleavage for both mRNAs occurred in a ribosome-dependent manner. This ribosome-dependent mRNA cleavage is very potent because the full-length mRNAs almost completely disappeared after 5 min of YafO induction as observed in Northern blotting analysis (Fig. 3) and the in vivo primer extension experiment (Fig. 4). Importantly, this in vivo observation was consistent with the in vitro toeprinting experiments using 70 S ribosomes, tRNAfMet, purified YafO, and the same mRNAs (Fig. 5). It should be noted that although the toeprinting bands in the presence of YafO (TP(O) in lanes 9 and 12 in Fig. 5) were almost identical to those in the absence of YafO (TP(r) in Fig. 5, lane 10), TP(O) bands were formed because of the cleavage of respective mRNAs because identical bands were detected even after phenol extraction (Fig. 6, lanes 4 and 8). TP(r) bands are known to be the toeprinting bands resulting from binding of ribosome to mRNA that forms the translation initiation complex (6Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Therefore, this band could not be detected after phenol extraction (Fig. 6, lane 6). Because TP(O) bands are almost at the same positions as TP(r) bands, except for the downstream band in TP(O), which is one base downstream of that in TP(r), it appears that YafO binding to 50 S ribosomal subunits in the translational complex induces mRNA cleavage at the 3′-end of the mRNA region protected by the binding of 70 S ribosomes. It is important to note that YafO alone was not able to cleave mRNAs in the toeprinting experiments (Fig. 5), and only when it was added together with 70 S ribosomes, the mRNAs were cleaved downstream of AUG. Because 70 S ribosome binding to mRNA in the formation of the translation initiation complex does not lead to mRNA cleavage (Fig. 6, lane 6), the observed mRNA cleavage is likely to be caused by the latent endoribonuclease activity of YafO, which may be induced by its binding to 50 S subunits. The induction of the latent endoribonuclease activity may be a common mechanism for some of the toxins associated with either 30 or 50 S ribosomal subunits to inhibit protein synthesis. In this respect, it is interesting to note that when RelE, another toxin for translation inhibition that has no endoribonuclease activity by itself, was induced in E. coli, ribosome-dependent mRNA cleavage was observed (4Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2003; 112: 131-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Another E. coli toxin called YoeB, which has 19% identity to YafO, also cleaves mRNA in a ribosome-dependent manner (23Christensen S.K. Maenhaut-Michel G. Mine N. Gottesman S. Gerdes K. Van Melderen L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1705-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and has been shown to have a weak endoribonuclease activity (24Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that YoeB cleaves mRNAs immediately downstream of the initiation codon only when it is added together with the 70 S ribosomes (8Zhang Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6627-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the mRNA cleavage pattern by YoeB is different from that of YafO. First, the full-length mRNA almost completely disappeared within 5 min after YafO induction (Figs. 3A and 4), whereas the full-length mRNAs were stable even at 30 min after YoeB induction (8Zhang Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6627-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Second, YoeB mediated mRNA cleavage occurs at the A site (8Zhang Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6627-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas YafO-mediated mRNA cleavage occurs outside of the region covered by 70 S ribosomes (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Third, in the region downstream of the initiation codon, which is greater than 100 bases in length, only one strong cleavage band was formed with YoeB (8Zhang Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6627-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas a few cleavage bands were observed in the identical region with YafO (Fig. 4). It should be noted that the inability to form the first peptide does not affect YafO-mediated ribosome-dependent mRNA cleavage activity (Fig. 8). These facts indicated that even if both YoeB and YafO inhibit protein synthesis within a short period of time (Fig. 1), the mechanism of inhibition is different for each of them. It is possible that YafO may also be able to inhibit translation elongation. Further studies are needed to elucidate how this toxin inhibits protein synthesis. It is interesting to note that bacterial toxins such as YoeB (8Zhang Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6627-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and YafO, which inhibit translation by functioning as ribosome-dependent endoribonucleases, may block protein synthesis in two steps. Initially, the binding of the toxin to 70 S ribosomes inhibits translation reversibly via binding with its cognate antitoxin. However, in the second step, as the toxin binding to ribosomes is prolonged, the latent ribonuclease activity of the toxin is induced to cleave mRNAs, which results in irreversible inhibition of protein synthesis. Such a two-step inhibitory mechanism of protein synthesis may play an intricate regulatory role in cell growth under a stress condition. It is quite intriguing that E. coli is equipped with a number of toxins to inhibit protein synthesis by different mechanisms; for example MazF (6Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and ChpBK (7Zhang Y. Zhu L. Zhang J. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26080-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) function as mRNA interferases to cleave mRNAs in a ribosome-independent manner, whereas the others such as RelE, YafO, and YoeB (8Zhang Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6627-6638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) appear to be ribosome-dependent mRNA interferases inhibiting translation. Recently, we demonstrated that Doc from the phd-doc toxin-antitoxin system in P1 phage inhibits translation elongation by binding to 30 S ribosome subunits (25Liu M. Zhang Y. Inouye M. Woychik N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5885-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The diversity of mechanisms targeting translation in E. coli toxin-antitoxin systems may be important to form an intricate toxin-antitoxin network in the cell to adapt ever-changing environmental stresses in nature. It remains to be elucidated how these toxin-antitoxin systems play physiological roles under different stress conditions. We thank Dr. Sangita Phadtare for the critical reading of this manuscript. We also thank Guangying Sun for assistance doing the course of experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2166588979,"Background There is an urgent need for the discovery and development of new drugs against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, especially due to the recent emergence of multi-drug and extensively-drug resistant strains. Herein, we have examined the susceptibility of mycobacteria to the natural product platensimycin. Methods and Findings We have demonstrated that platensimycin has bacteriostatic activity against the fast growing Mycobacterium smegmatis (MIC = 14 µg/ml) and against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC = 12 µg/ml). Growth in the presence of paltensimycin specifically inhibited the biosynthesis of mycolic acids suggesting that the antibiotic targeted the components of the mycolate biosynthesis complex. Given the inhibitory activity of platensimycin against β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases from Staphylococcus aureus, M. tuberculosis KasA, KasB or FabH were overexpressed in M. smegmatis to establish whether these mycobacterial KAS enzymes were targets of platensimycin. In M. smegmatis overexpression of kasA or kasB increased the MIC of the strains from 14 µg/ml, to 30 and 124 µg/ml respectively. However, overexpression of fabH on did not affect the MIC. Additionally, consistent with the overexpression data, in vitro assays using purified proteins demonstrated that platensimycin inhibited Mt-KasA and Mt-KasB, but not Mt-FabH. Significance Our results have shown that platensimycin is active against mycobacterial KasA and KasB and is thus an exciting lead compound against M. tuberculosis and the development of new synthetic analogues."

The translation of therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma from the experimental phase into the clinic has been limited by insufficient animal models, which lack important features of human tumors. Lentiviral gene therapy is an attractive therapeutic option for human glioblastoma, which we validated in a clinically relevant animal model.We used a rodent xenograft model that recapitulates the invasive and angiogenic features of human glioblastoma to analyze the transduction pattern and therapeutic efficacy of lentiviral pseudotyped vectors. Both, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein (LCMV-GP) and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviral vectors very efficiently transduced human glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, pseudotyped gammaretroviral vectors, similar to those evaluated for clinical therapy of glioblastoma, showed inefficient gene transfer in vitro and in vivo. Both pseudotyped lentiviral vectors transduced cancer stem-like cells characterized by their CD133-, nestin- and SOX2-expression, the ability to form spheroids in neural stem cell medium and to express astrocytic and neuronal differentiation markers under serum conditions. In a therapeutic approach using the suicide gene herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-1-tk) fused to eGFP, both lentiviral vectors mediated a complete remission of solid tumors as seen on MRI resulting in a highly significant survival benefit (p<0.001) compared to control groups. In all recurrent tumors, surviving eGFP-positive tumor cells were found, advocating prodrug application for several cycles to even enhance and prolong the therapeutic effect.In conclusion, lentiviral pseudotyped vectors are promising candidates for gene therapy of glioma in patients. The inefficient gene delivery by gammaretroviral vectors is in line with the results obtained in clinical therapy for GBM and thus confirms the high reproducibility of the invasive glioma animal model for translational research."
https://openalex.org/W2009892806,"Hedgehog pathway activity has been demonstrated in malignant glioma. However, its role in tumor growth has not been determined. Here we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of the Hedgehog pathway in established orthotopic malignant glioma xenografts confers a survival advantage. Pathway inhibition is measured in transplanted human tumor cells and not in host mouse brain. Correspondingly, survival benefit is observed only in tumors with an operational Hedgehog pathway. These data indicate that Hedgehog signaling regulates the growth of select malignant gliomas. We also demonstrate that Hedgehog pathway component and gene target expression segregate to CD133+ tumor initiating cells. Treated mice eventually succumb to disease, thus, targeting the Hedgehog pathway in CD133+ cells produces significant, but incomplete tumor regression. Therefore, our studies suggest that more complete tumor regression may require the inclusion of other therapeutic targets, including CD133− cells."

We previously generated ataxin-2 (Atxn2) knockout mice and demonstrated that these animals lacked obvious anatomical abnormalities of the CNS, but showed marked obesity and reduced fertility. We now report on behavioral changes as a consequence of Atxn2-deficiency. Atxn2-deficiency was associated with impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in the amygdala, but normal LTP in the hippocampus. Intact hippocampal plasticity was associated behaviorally with normal Morris Water maze testing. Impaired amygdala plasticity was associated with reduced cued and contextual fear conditioning. Conditioned taste aversion, however, was normal. In addition, knockout mice showed decreased innate fear in several tests and motor hyperactivity in open cage testing. Our results suggest that Atxn2-deficiency results in a specific set of behavioral and cellular disturbances that include motor hyperactivity and abnormal fear-related behaviors, but intact hippocampal function. This animal model may be useful for the study of anxiety disorders and should encourage studies of anxiety in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2)."

To identify linear neutralizing epitopes of PA, 145 overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of the protein were synthesized. Six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antisera from mice specific for PA were tested for their reactivity to the peptides by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Three major linear immunodominant B-cell epitopes were mapped to residues Leu156 to Ser170, Val196 to Ile210, and Ser312 to Asn326 of the PA protein.

The three-dimensional complex structure of PA and its neutralizing mAbs 7.5G and 19D9 were modeled using the molecular docking method providing models for the interacting epitope and paratope residues. For both mAbs, LeTx neutralization was associated with interference with furin cleavage, but they differed in effectiveness depending on whether they bound on the N- or C-terminal aspect of the cleaved products. The two peptides containing these epitopes that include amino acids Leu156–Ser170 and Val196–Ile210 were immunogenic and elicited neutralizing antibody responses to PA.

Bacillus anthracis is a Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that secretes a variety of toxins, including anthrax toxin.

Like other binary toxins, anthrax toxin follows the same pattern where distinct subunits are involved in the different steps at which it can act. The B subunit (PA) is involved in receptor binding and cellular internalization into the cytoplasm, whereas the A subunit (EF and/or LF) bears the enzymatic activity (1Barth H. Aktories K.

Anthrax can occur naturally in animals by spore transmission via ingestion, inhalation, or an open skin wound, but it can also be a result of bioterrorism and biological warfare (2Inglesby T.V.

PA is the component of the currently licensed anthrax vaccine that elicits protective antibodies. Recent studies have demonstrated that a strong humoral response to truncated recombinant PA contributes to a protective immune response to anthrax (3Abboud N. Casadevall A. Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2008; 15: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Flick-Smith H.C. Walker N.J. Gibson P. Bullifent H. Hayward S. Miller J. Titball R.W. Williamson E.D. Infect.

Accordingly, there is considerable interest in ascertaining the location and immunogenicity of B-cell epitopes on the PA molecule. The development of numerous monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to different epitopes on the PA molecule that influence PA functions, in conjunction with epitope mapping, has provided an opportunity to study the fine antigenic structure of PA. Most of these epitopes have been defined in mice (5Gubbins M.J. Berry J.D. Corbett C.R. Mogridge J. Yuan X.Y. Schmidt L. Nicolas B. Kabani A. Tsang R.S. FEMS Immunol. Med.

Consequently, the epitopes described thus far are localized to three discrete regions within the PA. These regions correspond to the 2β2–2β3 loop of domain 2, the domain 3-domain 4 boundary, and the small loop of domain 4. The 2β2–2β3 loop of domain 2 is responsible for mediating membrane insertion, and many neutralizing murine mAbs target this region (5Gubbins M.J. Berry J.D. Corbett C.R. Mogridge J. Yuan X.Y.

Chen W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 1164-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The boundary between domains 3 and 4, which does not have a known functional activity, has been suggested as a region recognized by polyclonal antibodies from vaccinated humans and rabbits (6Reed D.S. Smoll J. Gibbs P. Little S.F. Cytometry. 2002; 49: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 12Baillie L. Townend T. Walker N. Eriksson U. Williamson D. FEMS Immunol. Med.

The cellular receptor binding region is localized to the small loop of domain 4, and this region has been described to be recognized by two neutralizing mAbs (7Rosovitz M.J. Schuck P. Varughese M.

With the exception of a neutralizing mAb that bound to PA20 (13Rivera J. Nakouzi A. Abboud N. Revskaya E. Goldman D. Collier R.J. Dadachova E. Casadevall A. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4149-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), no B-cell epitopes have been reported in domain 1. Therefore, identification of further dominant antigenic epitopes is pivotal for understanding the minimal immunogenic region of PA that will allow for precise direction of potent immune responses. Two mAbs to PA have been reported previously by our laboratory, one known as 7.5G binds to domain 1 and can neutralize the cytotoxic activity of lethal toxin (LeTx) (13Rivera J. Nakouzi A. Abboud N. Revskaya E. Goldman D. Collier R.J. Dadachova E. Casadevall A. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4149-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The other, mAb 10F4, binds to domain 4 and has weak neutralizing activity. In addition, we now describe four new anti-PA mAbs, of which only one neutralizes LeTx. The characterization of the B-cell epitopes in PA recognized by protective and nonprotective mAbs is important to better understand the antigenic structure of this toxin, and such information is potentially useful for the design of vaccines and passive immune therapies against B. anthracis. Because PA has been identified as an effective subunit vaccine, we wanted to identify the specific epitopes that provide the protection and use them as immunogens. Using mAbs and 145 overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of PA, we identify the first linear neutralizing epitopes in domain 1 of PA, and we demonstrate that two peptides containing epitopes in domain 1 were capable of inducing strong LeTx-neutralizing antibody responses. B. anthracis Sterne strain 34F2 (pXO1+, pXO2−) was obtained from Dr. Alex Hoffmaster at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA). Bacterial cultures were grown in brain heart infusion broth (Difco) at 37 °C for 18 h while shaking. Recombinant PA and LF were obtained from Wadsworth Laboratories, New York State Department of Health (Albany, NY). Fragments of PA comprising one or more domains were expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (13Rivera J. Nakouzi A. Abboud N. Revskaya E. Goldman D. Collier R.J. Dadachova E. Casadevall A. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4149-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Female BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old) were obtained from the NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda). Two mice received an initial conjugate dose of 50 μl, whereas the third mouse was immunized with 100 μl of galactoxylomannan-protective antigen (GalXM-PA) conjugate (14De Jesus M. Nicola A.M. Rodrigues M.L. Janbon G. Casadevall A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). All mice were subsequently immunized with 50 μl of the conjugate in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) at day 14. Serum titers were analyzed to determine antigen response. Mice where boosted daily with 50 μl of the conjugate 3 days prior to fusion. Hybridomas making mAbs to PA were generated by standard techniques from splenocytes of GalXM-PA-immunized BALB/c mice (15de StGroth S.F. Scheidegger D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 35: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). The GalXM-PA conjugate had been synthesized to generate antibodies to GalXM for an independent study (14De Jesus M. Nicola A.M. Rodrigues M.L. Janbon G. Casadevall A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and we took advantage of the availability of mice with high titers to PA to make additional PA-binding mAbs. Briefly, splenocytes from GalXM-PA-immunized mice were fused to NSO myeloma cells at a ratio of 4:1. NSO is the nonproducing mouse myeloma fusion partner. Two weeks later, hybridoma supernatants were screened by ELISA for antibody reactivity to PA. Hybridoma clones were then selected and stabilized by cloning twice in soft agar. The isotypes of the murine mAbs were established by ELISA using isotype-specific reagents (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). Total RNA was isolated from hybridoma cell lines producing mAbs to EF using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 ml of TRIzol reagent was used per 106 log phase hybridoma cells, and 50 ng of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with oligo(dT) primer and superscript II reverse transcriptase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Universal 5′ (sense) variable region and specific 3′ (antisense) constant region primers were used in a PCR to generate cDNA encoding the variable domains of mAbs. The primers are as follows: 3′MsCγ, AGACCTATGGGGCTGTTGTTTTGGC; 3′MsCμ, GACATTTGGGAAGGACTGACTCTC; 3′MsCκ, TGGATACAGTTGGTGCAGCATCAGC; 5′VHuni, TGAGGTGCAGCTGGAGGAGTC; and 5′Vκuni, GACATTCTGATGACCCAGTCT. The PCR was performed using 1 μg of the cDNA templates, with 2.5 mm each of deoxynucleoside triphosphate and 125 nm each of primer under the following conditions with Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science): 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min for 40 cycles, followed by a final 10-min extension at 72 °C. The amplified cDNAs were gel-purified (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and then sequenced at the Sequencing Facility of the Cancer Center at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The LeTx neutralization assay used J774 macrophage-like cells treated with PA and LF, and mAb antitoxin activity was measured using the MTT assay for cell viability. All incubations were done at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, 95% relative humidity. J774 cells were plated in 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 17–19 h prior to the assay. The following day, 100 μl of the cell supernatant was removed from wells containing J774 cells and then incubated with 100 ng each of PA and LF and/or a range of dilutions of each antibody sample for 4 h. Cell viability was determined by the addition of 25 μl/well of a 5 mg/ml stock solution of MTT, and the incubation continued for 2 h. The assay was terminated by addition of 100 μl/well of the extraction buffer (12% SDS, 45% N,N-dimethylformamide) and incubated overnight. The optical density values were measured at 570 nm (Labsystem Multiskan, Franklin, MA). All antibodies were tested at least three times, and the average was taken for wells receiving LeTx plus antibody or LeTx alone. PA was digested with furin (Sigma) or trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). For trypsin digestions, 10 μg of rPA in 150 mm NaCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.2, was mixed with trypsin (1 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature in a 20-μl volume. For furin digests, 10 μg of PA was incubated in 20 μl of 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and mixed with 0.02–10 units of furin for 30 s to 15 min at 30 °C. PA was cleaved by chymotrypsin (1:1; Sigma) for 30 min at 30 °C. Digested products were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins were visualized by staining the gel with GelCode Blue Stain (Pierce). To determine the domain location of the epitopes recognized by the various mAbs to PA, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were employed. PA or its proteolytic digests were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and then separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel (10–20%). Proteins were then visualized by staining overnight with GelCode Blue Stain (Pierce). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (0.20 μm pore size) by electrophoretic transfer. The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated with mAbs 2.9H, 16A12, 19D9, or 20G7 overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBST, the membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat isotype-specific antibody. The ECL chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) was used to reveal horseradish peroxidase activity according to the manufacturer's instructions. To map the functional linear epitopes of PA, biotinylated soluble peptides representing the entire length of PA were synthesized as 15-mer, overlapping by 10 residues (total of 145 peptides), at the Proteomics Resource Center, Rockefeller University, New York. All peptides were created using an Intavis MultiPepTM (Intavis, Koln, Germany) Wang resins (p-alkoxy-benzyl alcohol) (Bachem, Torrance, CA) using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) nitrogen terminal protected amino acids (Anaspec, San Jose, CA) (17Wellings D.A. Atherton E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 44-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Coupling reactions were conducted using 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in N-methylpyrrolidinone as the primary solvent. All crude products were subsequently analyzed by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Waters) using an Acquity UPLCTM BEH130 C18 column. Individual peptide integrity was verified by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry using a Thermo Scientific TSQ VantageTM (Waltham, MA) liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry system (18Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 270: 519-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were supplied as a white powder soluble in water and stored at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Binding of antibody to PA was measured by ELISA. All incubations were done at 37 °C for 1 h. Briefly, a solution of rPA (1 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to coat polystyrene plates (Costar). The polystyrene plates were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS, and either immune sera or hybridoma supernatants were added. Primary antibody binding was detected using alkaline phosphatase labeled goat anti-mouse antibody reagents. After addition of substrate, absorbance was read at 405 nm. Nonlinear regression curve fit (one-site total binding) was used for calculation of dissociation constant values of mAbs 7.5G and 19D9 for PA samples. Plots, curve fits, and statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0a, GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA). For the peptide ELISAs, polystyrene plates were coated with 5 μg/ml streptavidin (100 μl/well) and kept overnight at 37 °C. Then the plates were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS (200 μl/well) for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST). Subsequently, biotinylated peptides (5 μg/ml) were added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After three washes with PBST, mAb or sera were added in dilution 1:100 or 1:500, respectively, in blocking buffer and incubated for 2 h. The plates were again washed with PBST. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat isotype-specific antibody was diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer, added to the plates, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After another wash, alkaline phosphatase substrate was added to each well and allowed to develop for 20 min, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured. These experiments were performed at least three times for each mAb. The background of each individual serum or mAb was determined in parallel by using streptavidin-coated, peptide-free wells. The cutoff value for real binding was defined as an absorbance value three times the average background value. Isotype and IgG subclass analysis was performed as described above, and serial 2-fold dilutions of sera from immunized mice were added. Detection was performed with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 at a 1:1000 dilution (Southern Biotechnology). mAb-mAb competition ELISAs were used to investigate the specificity of PA mAbs as described (19Casadevall A. Mukherjee J. Scharff M.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 154: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, a variable amount of one mAb was mixed with a constant amount of a second different isotype mAb and allowed to bind to PA immobilized in a polystyrene plate. Binding of the mAbs was detected by isotype-specific alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse reagent. However, in the case of the same isotypes, one mAb was chosen at random to be labeled with alkaline phosphatase with a commercially available kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. In all instances, incubations were done at 37 °C for 1 h, and absorbances were measured in a microtiter plate reader at 405 nm (Labsystems Multiskan). Six- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used for immunizations. The following peptides LKQKSSNSRKKRSTS (MAP-D5) and VKNKRTFLSPWISNI (MAP-E1) were prepared on an eight-branched lysine backbone (peptide on MAP were from W. M. Keck Facility, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Mice were immunized subcutaneously with 100 μg of MAP-peptide in CFA on day 0, followed by subcutaneous booster injections of 100 μg of MAP-peptide in IFA on days 7 and 14. Control mice were immunized with the MAP core (Anaspec, San Jose, CA) in adjuvant and followed the same immunization schedule. Serum was obtained on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 35, and 49. All animal work was done in accordance with regulations of the Institute for Animal Studies at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Six- to 8-week-old female A/JCr mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.1 mg of mAb 19D9 2 h prior to intravenous infection with 104 bacterial cells of B. anthracis. Mice were monitored daily for mortality and morbidity and deaths recorded. All animal work was done in accordance with regulations of the Institute for Animal Studies at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Comparative protein structure models were generated for mAbs 7.5G and 19D9 based on the available similar structures of IgG2b and IgG1 molecules, respectively (Protein Data Bank accession codes 1ibg and 3dvg), using the multiple mapping method (20Rai B.K. Fiser A. Proteins. 2006; 63: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) to generate a target-template sequence alignment and MODELLER (21Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) to generate the atomic models. mAbs 7.5G and 19D9 share 42 and 41% identical positions with 1ibg and 3dvg template structures, respectively. Next, 10,000 docking solutions were generated for each of the given antibodies with PA using the program FTDOCK (22Gabb H.A. Jackson R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The amino acid compositions of the putative epitopes of PA are known from the peptide library produced in this work, and these sequences can be found linearly displayed on PA. This information was used to screen and locate the most accurate complex structures. In some instances, some of the amino acids of a linear peptide segment are buried within the PA structure, and thus we developed a PERL program that searches the common surface between PA and the antibody for perfect matches with the amino acid composition of the reactive peptides (the PERL program uses VMD version 1.862 for surface recognition). The resulting rigid body docked complexes were used as structural templates to build an optimized atomic structure with MODELLER (21Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). All data were analyzed by the Student's t test, and survival analysis was done by log rank censoring long term survivors (SigmaStat, Chicago). Two hybridoma clones producing mAbs to PA (7.5G and 10F4) have been described previously (13Rivera J. Nakouzi A. Abboud N. Revskaya E. Goldman D. Collier R.J. Dadachova E. Casadevall A. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 4149-4156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and these antibodies will be further characterized in this study. All mice immunized with GalXM-PA conjugate in CFA responded to immunization with a serum antibody response to rPA (Fig. 1). The mouse with the highest antibody titer to PA was selected for spleen harvest and hybridoma generation, and the hybridoma supernatants were screened for reactivity toward PA. The end point ELISA titer with a minimal absorbance reading that was 3-fold higher than background was used as the criterion to select antibodies for the next stage of analysis. Four mAbs were recovered: three IgG1s (29H, 16A12, and 19D9) and one IgM (20G7). To determine the variable gene usage of the PA-binding mAbs, the sequences of the heavy and light chain Ig mRNA of each mAb were determined. Total RNA from each hybridoma cell was isolated and reverse-transcribed to generate cDNA. Then the heavy and light chain cDNAs were amplified by PCR using either VH or VK primers, respectively. Analysis of the sequences revealed that all mAbs are similar in molecular construction, using the same germ line VH7183 and VKBD2 gene element (Table 1). For each mAb, the VH and VK domains were deposited in the GenBankTM data base under the respective accession numbers listed.TABLE 1Hybridoma families and mAb VH and VL usageHybridomaNeutralizingAccession no.aAccession numbers are shown for sequences in GenBankTM (Bethesda).Variable gene elementsbVariable gene usage was assigned from homology searches.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the domains recognized by the various mAbs to PA, an ELISA detection assay was employed where we studied the binding of the various antibodies to recombinant proteins expressing individual or combinations of different domains of PA as coated protein. We identified two mAbs (19D9 and 20G7) binding to domain 1 of PA and two mAbs (29H and 16A12) binding to expressed protein containing domains 2–4 (data not shown). These results were further confirmed by the binding of mAbs to enzyme-digested PA by Western blot analysis. mAbs 29H and 16A12 bound to PA63, whereas mAbs 19D9 and 20G7 bound to PA20 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we determined the number of antigenic sites recognized by these antibodies with competition ELISA. The mAb pairs of 19D9 and 20G7, and 29H and 16A12, competed with each other for binding to PA (data not shown). In addition, mAbs 7.5G and 10F4 did not compete with any of the mAbs, implying that each recognized a different epitope on PA. From these experiments we conclude that two mAb sets bind to the same epitopes. Measurement of the affinity of the mAbs for PA was determined by ELISA. The Kd values of the identified antibodies were 5.877 nm for 7.5G and 0.2113 nm for 19D9 (data not shown). We studied the ability of mAbs to protect macrophages against toxin-mediated cytotoxicity. Each mAb was tested for LeTx neutralization with concentration adjustment (between 75 and 0.5 μg/ml). Therefore, this screening method selected for mAbs that either protected at high levels of antibody or at lower antibody concentrations obtaining high neutralization activity. Only one mAb, 19D9, exhibited significant neutralization activity, and this effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 3). To examine further the ability of mAb 19D9 to neutralize LeTx, we tested its protective efficacy in vivo. The mAbs were administered to the mice (5 mice/group) intraperitoneally 2 h prior to intravenous infection with B. anthracis-germinated cells. Control animals received PBS instead of antibody. Administration of mAb 19D9 prolonged the survival of infected mice compared with control mice (data not shown). In addition, mAb 7.5G has also been shown to prolong the survival of BALB/c mice injected with toxin (13Rivera J. Nakouzi A. Abboud N. Revskaya E. Gol"
https://openalex.org/W2077294651,"By inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) promotes cancer progression and fibrosis. Here we show that expression of the TGF-beta receptor-associated protein, SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation), decreases within 72 h of exposure to TGF-beta and that this decline is both required and sufficient for the induction of several markers of EMT. It has been suggested recently that expression of the TGF-beta signaling mediators, Smad2 and Smad3, may have different functional effects, with Smad2 loss being more permissive for EMT progression. We find that the loss of SARA expression leads to a concomitant decrease in Smad2 expression and a disruption of Smad2-specific transcriptional activity, with no effect on Smad3 signaling or expression. Further, the effects of inducing the loss of Smad2 mimic those of the loss of SARA, enhancing expression of the EMT marker, smooth muscle alpha-actin. Smad2 mRNA levels are not affected by the loss of SARA. However, the ubiquitination of Smad2 is increased in SARA-deficient cells. We therefore examined the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 and found that although Smurf2 expression was unaltered in SARA-deficient cells, the interaction of Smad2 and Smurf2 was enhanced. These results describe a significant role for SARA in regulating cell phenotype and suggest that its effects are mediated through modification of the balance between Smad2 and Smad3 signaling. In part, this is achieved by enhancing the association of Smad2 with Smurf2, leading to Smad2 degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2115553815,"Galápagos tortoises represent the only surviving lineage of giant tortoises that exhibit two different types of shell morphology. The taxonomy of Galápagos tortoises was initially based mainly on diagnostic morphological characters of the shell, but has been clarified by molecular studies indicating that most islands harbor monophyletic lineages, with the exception of Isabela and Santa Cruz. On Santa Cruz there is strong genetic differentiation between the two tortoise populations (Cerro Fatal and La Reserva) exhibiting domed shell morphology. Here we integrate nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial data with statistical analyses of shell shape morphology to evaluate whether the genetic distinction and variability of the two domed tortoise populations is paralleled by differences in shell shape. Based on our results, morphometric analyses support the genetic distinction of the two populations and also reveal that the level of genetic variation is associated with morphological shell shape variation in both populations. The Cerro Fatal population possesses lower levels of morphological and genetic variation compared to the La Reserva population. Because the turtle shell is a complex heritable trait, our results suggest that, for the Cerro Fatal population, non-neutral loci have probably experienced a parallel decrease in variability as that observed for the genetic data."
https://openalex.org/W1977108246,"A hallmark of protective immunity during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) infection is the regulated secretion of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines. Suppressors of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) are key regulators of cytokine secretion and function. In this study we investigated regulation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin receptor 1 (DC-SIGNR1)-mediated SOCS1 expression in DCs during M. tb infection. We show that, compared with TLR2, stimulating DC-SIGNR1 on DCs induces higher SOCS1 expression and lower interleukin-12 production. Co-stimulating DC-SIGNR1 and TLR2 differentially regulates SOCS1 expression depending on the relative concentration of their ligands. Stimulating DC-SIGNR1 with M. tb infection increases SOCS1 expression, while stimulating TLR2 with M. tb infection reduces SOCS1 expression. Knockdown of SOCS1 in DCs by siRNA enhances interleukin-12 transcription and protein expression upon DC-SIGNR1 stimulation. Raf-1 and Syk differentially regulate TLR2- and DC-SIGNR1-mediated SOCS1 expression. In addition, DC-SIGNR1 shows greater association with SOCS1 when compared with TLR2. Interestingly, compared with healthy asymptomatic individuals, peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with active tuberculosis disease showed higher expression of SOCS1, which was reduced following chemotherapy. Similarly, stimulating DC-SIGNR1 on DCs from M. tb-infected TLR2(-/-) mice enhanced SOCS1 expression that was reduced following chemotherapy. Further, knockdown of SOCS1 in mouse DCs or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in increased killing of virulent M. tb. These results indicate that TLR2 and DC-SIGNR1 differentially regulate SOCS1 expression during M. tb infection. This in turn regulates M. tb survival by governing key cytokine expression."
https://openalex.org/W1981811253,"The existence of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) cross-reacting with the human major histocompatibility antigens HLA-B14 and HLA-B27 suggests that their alloreactivity could be due to presentation of shared peptides in similar binding modes by these molecules. We therefore determined the crystal structures of the subtypes HLA-B*1402, HLA-B*2705, and HLA-B*2709 in complex with a proven self-ligand, pCatA (peptide with the sequence IRAAPPPLF derived from cathepsin A (residues 2–10)), and of HLA-B*1402 in complex with a viral peptide, pLMP2 (RRRWRRLTV, derived from latent membrane protein 2 (residues 236–244) of Epstein-Barr virus). Despite the exchange of 18 residues within the binding grooves of HLA-B*1402 and HLA-B*2705 or HLA-B*2709, the pCatA peptide is presented in nearly identical conformations. However, pLMP2 is displayed by HLA-B*1402 in a conformation distinct from those previously found in the two HLA-B27 subtypes. In addition, the complexes of HLA-B*1402 with the two peptides reveal a nonstandard, tetragonal mode of the peptide N terminus anchoring in the binding groove because of the exchange of the common Tyr-171 by His-171 of the HLA-B*1402 heavy chain. This exchange appears also responsible for reduced stability of HLA-B14-peptide complexes in vivo and slow assembly in vitro. The studies with the pCatA peptide uncover that CTL cross-reactive between HLA-B14 and HLA-B27 might primarily recognize the common structural features of the bound peptide, thus neglecting amino acid replacements within the rim of the binding grooves.

However, although alloreactive T cells are very common and of great clinical importance, neither the primary basis for their existence nor the reasons underlying their cross-reactivity are sufficiently understood to draw general conclusions (9Felix N.J.

One of the most important questions regards the individual contribution of the bound peptide and binding groove residues of the heavy chain (HC) of MHC class I antigens to the interaction with T cell receptors (TCR).Here we analyze an HLA-B14 subtype, HLA-B*1402 (named B*1402), as well as two HLA-B27 subtypes, HLA-B*2705 and HLA-B*2709 (named B*2705 and B*2709), to shed light on the structural basis of peptide presentation and T cell alloreactivity among these HLA-B molecules. The amino acid sequences of B*1402 and B*2705 HC differ from each other at 18 positions, all of which are part of the peptide-binding groove (Fig. 1). These amino acid exchanges result in different repertoires of bound peptides; B*1402 and B*2705 share only about 4% of their peptides (19Merino E. Montserrat V. Paradela A. López de Castro J.A. J.

Statistically significant differences between B*1402 and B*2705 are also found at several other peptide positions (19Merino E. Montserrat V. Paradela A. López de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35868-35880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previous structural and cellular studies of the HLA-B27 subtypes have suggested that molecular mimicry between the viral peptide pLMP2 (RRRWRRLTV, derived from Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 2, residues 236–244) and the self-peptide pVIPR (RRKWRRWHL, derived from vasoactive intestinal peptide type 1 receptor, residues 400–408), when bound to B*2705, serves as an example of how a cellular immune response could be triggered that might contribute to the onset of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) through an autoimmune mechanism (22Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Fiorillo M.T. Rückert C. Hülsmeyer M. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2962-2971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CTL that recognize the B*2705 and the B*2709 subtypes in complex with the self-peptide pVIPR (22Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) exemplify alloreactivity in this system, although the D116H micropolymorphism is deeply buried and not directly accessible to a TCR.Alloreactive T cells are known to recognize a very diverse array of alloantigen-bound peptides (32Heath W.R. Kane K.P. Mescher M.F. Sherman L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 5101-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33Wang W. Man S. Gulden P.H. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1091-1097PubMed Google Scholar), so that virtually each T cell clone can be assumed to be specific for a distinct peptide. For this reason, the substantial correlation found in previous studies between peptide and the alloreactive T cell epitope sharing among HLA-B27 (reviewed in Ref. 34López de Castro J.A. Molecular Mechanisms of Spondyloarthropathies.in: López-Larrea C. Díaz-Peña R. Vol. 649. 2009: 196-209Google Scholar) or HLA-B14 subtypes (only 28.4% partial or full cross-reactivity, similar to peptide overlapping between the subtypes B*1402 and B*1403, see Ref. 19Merino E. Montserrat V. Paradela A. López de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35868-35880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) supports a prominent role of peptides in determining alloreactive T cell cross-reaction, and it suggests that many shared ligands adopt antigenically similar conformations when bound to distinct HLA-B molecules. On the other hand, the results reported by Merino et al. (19Merino E. Montserrat V. Paradela A. López de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35868-35880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) also demonstrate that the few CTL that cross-react with B*1402 and B*2705 did not exhibit cross-reactivity with B*1403, which is distinguished from B*1402 only by a single amino acid exchange in the α2-helix. Furthermore, they show that alloreactive CTL from various donors directed against B*2705 did not lyse cells expressing either B*1402 or B*1403, although the number of CTL tested might not have been high enough to detect a presumably low degree of cross-reactivity. Without structural data from HLA-B14 subtypes, however, these results are difficult to interpret.The pCatA peptide (IRAAPPPLF, derived from the signal sequence of cathepsin A, residues 2–10) is among the very few known common ligands of B*1402, B*2705 (19Merino E. Montserrat V. Paradela A. López de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35868-35880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and B*2709 3E. Merino and J. A. López de Castro, unpublished observations. 3E. Merino and J. A. López de Castro, unpublished observations. and can thus serve to study how a very different (B*1402) and two very similar subtypes (B*2705 and B*2709) handle a common ligand. On the other hand, the pLMP2 peptide is a proven natural ligand only of B*2705, whose possible presentation in vivo by B*2709 and HLA-B14 is not yet known, although this peptide can be complexed in vitro with B*2709 (24Fiorillo M.T.

Chem. 2005; 280: 2962-2971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and also with B*1402 (35Kumar P. Vahedi-Faridi A. Merino E. López de Castro J.A. Volz A. Ziegler A. Saenger W. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2007; 63: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). From previous crystallographic studies, it was known that pLMP2 is presented by the two HLA-B27 antigens in very different conformations (24Fiorillo M.T. Rückert C. Hülsmeyer M. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2962-2971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We expected that the pronounced sequence differences between B*1402 and the HLA-B27 alloantigens (Fig. 1) might even enhance the conformational dissimilarities that are observed when two very closely related subtypes such as B*2705 and B*2709 are compared. Discrepancies in peptide display could reasonably be expected to prevent CTL cross-reaction, so that pLMP2 might be considered as a representative of the vast majority of HLA-B14- and HLA-B27-presented ligands that must be responsible for the low degree of CTL cross-reactivity between these alloantigens. Despite these presumed differences between pCatA and pLMP2, both peptides may be seen as examples of ligands that could principally allow direct allorecognition.Here we report the crystal structures of B*1402·pCatA, B*2705·pCatA, B*2709·pCatA, and B*1402·pLMP2, and we compare them with each other and with the previously reported structures of B*2705·pLMP2 and B*2709·pLMP2 (24Fiorillo M.T.

Chem. 2005; 280: 2962-2971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe present crystallographic study was primarily undertaken to provide a better understanding for the observation that alloreactive CTL can be generated against cells expressing B*1402 that cross-react with HLA-B27 molecules, despite the considerable exchanges that characterize the peptide-binding grooves of the two antigens (Fig. 1) (19Merino E. Montserrat V. Paradela A. López de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35868-35880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Most of these differences affect the α1-helix and the floor of the binding groove with eight and seven exchanges, respectively, whereas there are only three α2-helical exchanges. We analyzed a proven shared ligand of B*1402 and HLA-B27 antigens, the self-peptide pCatA, as well as a nonself-ligand, the viral peptide pLMP2. The overall structures of the B*1402 and HLA-B27 complexes with both peptides are related, but a detailed comparison of the two peptides reveals that they are bound either very similarly (pCatA) or in distinct conformations (pLMP2) (Tables 2 and 3; Figs. 2 and 3).The anchoring of the N termini of bound peptides through a pentagonal hydrogen bond network within the A pocket (Fig. 4; Table 4) is known to be one of the most concordant features of peptide presentation by MHC molecules (52Madden D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 587-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the structure of B*3501 in complex with an octameric peptide reveals that the pentagonal network can also exist in a slightly modified form in which the N terminus of the peptide is shifted upwards, preventing its direct participation but permitting the establishment of a connection to the pentagonal network through a water molecule (53Smith K.J. Reid S.W. Stuart D.I. McMichael A.J. Jones E.Y. Bell J.I. Immunity. 1996; 4: 203-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), instead of forming one of the five corners of the pentagonal network. The latter represents the “normal” situation and can be found in HLA-B35 molecules presenting nonameric peptides (15Tynan F.E. Elhassen D. Purcell A.W. Burrows J.M. Borg N.A. Miles J.J. Williamson N.A. Green K.J. Tellam J. Kjer-Nielsen L. McCluskey J. Rossjohn J. Burrows S.R. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16Hourigan C.S. Harkiolaki M.

Biol. 1999; 285: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), in all other published structures of “classical” MHC class I molecules, or in the structures of the HLA-B27 subtypes with the pCatA peptide described here. A comparison of the binding of the nonameric Tax peptide (Tax9) and an N-terminally truncated octamer (Tax8) to HLA-A2 shows that the removal of p1, a residue essential for formation of the pentagonal network, significantly reduces the affinity of the interaction between the ligand and the A pocket (54Khan A.R. Baker B.M. Ghosh P. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6398-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), but it does not eliminate the pentagonal network that is present in the Tax9 as well as the Tax8 peptide structures, with positions of the p1 atoms crucial for connecting the peptide with the ring formed by water molecules in the Tax8 structure.However, a drastically different coordination of the peptide N terminus is triggered by the presence of His-171, as in B*1402. It results in the formation of a tetragonal network of hydrogen bonds. The water molecule (W′ in Fig. 4), which “replaces” the hydroxyl group of Tyr-171, is also contacted by the peptide N terminus. In contrast, the involvement of the other three members of both the tetragonal and the pentagonal networks (Tyr-7, the water molecule W, and Tyr-59) remains unchanged. The causative role of His-171 in implementing the formation of a tetragonal network is supported by the only other high resolution structure in which the MHC molecule exhibits this exchange at residue 171, B*5101 in complex with the KM1 peptide (55Maenaka K. Maenaka T. Tomiyama H. Takiguchi M. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3260-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A comparison of the diverse contacts formed by the pentagonal and tetragonal networks in the different structures (Fig. 4; Table 4) reveals that it is in fact the exchange at residue 171, and not that of the polymorphic A pocket residue Asp/Asn-63 (Fig. 1), that is responsible for the formation of the unusual network in B*1402 and B*5101; Asn-63 occurs also, for example, in B*3501 and B*3508, both of which bind the N terminus of nonoctameric peptides via a pentagonal network (15Tynan F.E.

A further and very divergent solution for the N-terminal anchoring of a ligand is realized in case of the mouse H-2M3 antigen. It binds only peptides with an N-formylated methionine at the N terminus. A number of crucial A pocket polymorphisms are responsible for a unique architecture that permits this molecule to adjust to the specialized binding requirements of ligands derived from the N terminus of proteins produced by bacteria and mitochondria (60Wang C.R.

HLA-B14-peptide complexes also exhibit a high maturation rate and a reduced stability in vivo when compared with B*2705, as well as a substantial rate of dissociation in post-endoplasmic reticulum compartments. These distinguishing features are possibly due to a less optimized peptide repertoire (61Merino E. Galocha B. Vázquez M.N. López de Castro J.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A reduced stability of HLA-B14 antigens might additionally be ascribed to the absence of the water-mediated contact between Arg-62 and Glu-163 that characterizes all HLA-B27-peptide complexes except those with pGly1 (see Refs. 21Hülsmeyer M.

This bridge-like structural feature contributes to keeping the peptide in place; it cannot form in B*1402 because of the presence of Thr-163 (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, the B*1402 subtype is widely distributed in various human populations, suggesting that the seemingly disadvantageous structural and biochemical features that are due to its unorthodox A pocket are no impediment for being a “successful” HLA class I antigen. However, the biological advantage conferred by expressing HLA-B14 molecules or of possessing HLA-B14-carrying haplotypes (63Li X. Ghandri N. Piancatelli D. Adams S. Chen D. Robbins F.M. Wang E.

https://openalex.org/W2079199039,"Cyclic AMP is a fundamentally important second messenger for numerous peptide hormones and neurotransmitters that control gene expression, cell proliferation, and metabolic homeostasis. Here we show that cAMP works with the POU homeodomain protein Oct-1 to regulate gene expression in pancreatic and intestinal endocrine cells. This ubiquitously expressed transcription factor is known as a stress sensor. We found that it also functions as a repressor of Cdx-2, a proglucagon gene activator. Through a mechanism that involves the activation of exchange protein activated by cyclic AMP, elevation of cAMP leads to enhanced phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of Oct-1 and reduced interactions between Oct-1 or nuclear co-repressors and the Cdx-2 gene promoter, detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation. In rat primary pancreatic islet cells, cAMP elevation also reduces nuclear Oct-1 content, which causes increased proglucagon and proinsulin mRNA expression. Our study therefore identifies a novel mechanism by which cAMP regulates hormone-gene expression and suggests that ubiquitously expressed Oct-1 may play a role in metabolic homeostasis by functioning as a sensor for cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2002252371,"The lipopolysaccharide of Vibrio cholerae has been reported to contain a single 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residue that is phosphorylated. The phosphorylated Kdo sugar further links the hexa-acylated V. cholerae lipid A domain to the core oliogosaccharide and O-antigen. In this report, we confirm that V. cholerae possesses the enzymatic machinery to synthesize a phosphorylated Kdo residue. Further, we have determined that the presence of the phosphate group on the Kdo residue is necessary for secondary acylation in V. cholerae. The requirement for a secondary substituent on the Kdo residue (either an additional Kdo sugar or a phosphate group) was also found to be critical for secondary acylation catalyzed by LpxL proteins from Bordetella pertussis, Escherichia coli, and Haemophilus influenzae. Although three putative late acyltransferase orthologs have been identified in the V. cholerae genome (Vc0212, Vc0213, and Vc1577), only Vc0213 appears to be functional. Vc0213 functions as a myristoyl transferase acylating lipid A at the 2'-position of the glucosamine disaccharide. Generally acyl-ACPs serve as fatty acyl donors for the acyltransferases required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis; however, in vitro assays indicate that Vc0213 preferentially utilizes myristoyl-CoA as an acyl donor. This is the first report to biochemically characterize enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the V. cholerae Kdo-lipid A domain."
https://openalex.org/W2039616380,"Matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) is mainly expressed in mineralizing tissues, and its C-terminal proteolytic cleavage product is an acidic-serine-asparate-rich-MEPE-associated motif (ASARM) that is a strong regulator of body phosphate metabolism and mineralization. There is sufficient data supporting a role for MEPE protein function in mineralization, however, little is known about the regulation of MEPE gene expression. As bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is one of the most important signals for calvarial mineralization and MEPE expression is higher in mineralized tissues, we attempted to uncover a regulatory circuit between BMP-2 and MEPE expression. Mepe expression is very low in proliferating MC3T3-E1 cells, but is dramatically increased in the mineralization stage and is strongly stimulated by treatment with BMP-2, even in proliferating cells. Overexpression and knock-down experiments of Smads, Dlx5, and Runx2 indicated that they are indispensable mediators of BMP-2-induced Mepe expression. In contrast, Msx2 showed strong inhibition of Mepe transcription. PHEX is an enzyme that prevents the release of the ASARM motif, a mineralization inhibitor, from the MEPE molecule. Thus, the MEPE/PHEX ratio may be a good indicator of mineralization progression because we found that the mRNA ratio and protein levels were low when osteoblasts were actively differentiating to the mineralization stage and the ratio was high when the cells reached the mineralization stage when it is assumed that osteocytes may protect themselves and make a space to survive from the mineralized matrix by releasing the ASARM motif.

Mineral homeostasis in the body is critical for healthy bones and teeth, and is generally regulated by the calcium-phosphate balance in the bone and kidney networks. In the past, the vitamin D/parathyroid hormone axis was assumed to be a single major circuit in bone-renal phosphate regulation, but recently, new bone-renal phosphate regulating factors have been identified.

Among these, autosomal-dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (OMIM number 193100) is characterized by renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, and inappropriately normal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 levels (1Econs M.J. McEnery P.T. Lennon F. Speer M.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2653-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Autosomal-dominant hypophosphatemic rickets is caused by a missense mutation of FGF23, which is resistant to proteolysis by PHEX and increases the half-life of full-length phosphaturic FGF23 (2White K.E. Carn G. Lorenz-Depiereux B. Benet-Pages A. Strom T.M. Econs M.J. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 2079-2086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Second, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (Hyp, OMIM number 307800) is characterized by defective renal phosphate handling, aberrant vitamin D metabolism, and defective calcification of bone (3Rowe P.S. Kumagai Y. Gutierrez G. Garrett I.R. Blacher R. Rosen D. Cundy J. Navvab S. Chen D. Drezner M.K. Quarles L.D. Mundy G.R. Bone. 2004; 34: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). X-linked hypophosphatemic is caused by an inactivating mutation in PHEX that increases the uncleaved full-length FGF23 and/or abnormal processing of MEPE. Third, oncogenic hypophosphatemic osteomalacia is caused by tumor-expressed proteins, MEPE and/or FGF23, whose overexpression results in abnormal renal phosphate metabolism and bone mineralization. Based on these data, FGF23, PHEX, and MEPE are generally accepted as the main regulators of systemic phosphate levels and tissue mineralization (4Rowe P.S. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2004; 15: 264-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).MEPE is also called osteoblast/osteocyte factor 45 as it is mainly expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes, and was first identified in a cDNA library of oncogenic hypophosphatemic osteomalacia (5Rowe P.S. de Zoysa P.A. Dong R. Wang H.R. White K.E. Econs M.J. Oudet C.L. Genomics. 2000; 67: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The MEPE gene encodes a 525-amino acid extracellular matrix protein (6Quarles L.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E1-E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). MEPE shares sequence homology with small integrin binding ligand, N-linked glycoprotein (SIBLING) family proteins such as bone sialoprotein, dentin sialophosphoprotein, osteopontin, and the dentin matrix protein, all of which are clustered on chromosome 4q21 in humans and 5q in mouse (5Rowe P.S. de Zoysa P.A.

Kidney Int. 2005; 68: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Two functional domains of MEPE have been well defined; one is the centrally located motif that includes an RGD, cell adhesion domain, and a SGDG, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interaction domain. AC-100, a 23-amino acid synthetic peptide comprised of RGD and SGDG, has demonstrated strong osteogenic activity (8Nagel D.E. Khosla S. Sanyal A. Rosen D.M. Kumagai Y. Riggs B.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Sprowson A.P. McCaskie A.W. Birch M.A. J. Orthop. Res. 2008; 26: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The other domain is a C-terminal ASARM motif that is common among the SIBLING family proteins although they are not functionally conserved (10Qin C. Baba O. Butler W.T. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2004; 15: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The C-terminal ASARM motif of the MEPE protein can be cleaved by proteolytic activity of cathepsin B and the proteolytic cleavage is protected by another enzyme, PHEX (4Rowe P.S. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2004; 15: 264-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The released ASARM motif circulates in the bloodstream to regulate reabsorption of phosphate in the renal proximal tubules and mineralization in bones and teeth (4Rowe P.S. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2004; 15: 264-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11White K.E. Larsson T.E. Econs M.J. Endocr. Rev. 2006; 27: 221-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For this reason, the ASARM peptide is also called minhibin due to its bone mineralization-inhibiting action, and phosphatonin by its phosphate reabsorption-inhibiting action. The targeted disruption of the MEPE gene in mice showed strongly increased bone mass that is not due to decreased osteoclastic activity but, rather, increased osteoblastic activity (12Gowen L.C. Petersen D.N. Mansolf A.L. Qi H. Stock J.L. Tkalcevic G.T. Simmons H.A. Crawford D.T. Chidsey-Frink K.L. Ke H.Z. McNeish J.D. Brown T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1998-2007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of MEPE in bone cells decreases the bone mass and high phosphate diet-induced renal stone development (13Martin A. David V. Fisher L. Hedge A. Rowe P. J. Bone Miner. Res. (abstr.). 2007; 22: F1118Google Scholar). The results from mouse genetic studies indicate that the function of the whole MEPE molecule is primarily due to the function of the C-terminal ASARM peptide.Despite advances in our understanding of MEPE function, the molecular mechanism regulating the expression of MEPE has not yet been investigated. Moreover, the transcriptional regulation of other SIBLING family genes has been relatively well described, however, that of MEPE has not been reported (14Bellahcène A. Castronovo V. Ogbureke K.U. Fisher L.W. Fedarko N.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 212-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Because MEPE controls the mineralization of both hard and soft tissues, understanding how its expression is regulated will provide great insight into target selection for the modulation of biomineralization. Previously we have compared expressed mRNAs between developing mouse calvariae and sutural mesenchyme by microarray analysis (15Cho J.Y. Lee W.B. Kim H.J. Mi Woo K. Baek J.H. Choi J.Y. Hur C.G. Ryoo H.M. Gene. 2006; 372: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We found that Mepe is one of the most highly expressed genes in mineralizing tissue. And it is well known that Mepe expression is specific in the bone (12Gowen L.C. Petersen D.N. Mansolf A.L. Qi H. Stock J.L. Tkalcevic G.T. Simmons H.A. Crawford D.T. Chidsey-Frink K.L. Ke H.Z.

In addition, we have also reported that BMP-2 and its downstream transcription factors, Dlx5 and Runx2-II, are specifically expressed in mineralizing calvarial tissue, but not in sutural mesenchyme (16Lee M.H.

Based on the common expression patterns of BMP-2 signaling molecules and Mepe, we can assume that BMP-2 signaling regulates Mepe expression in bone cells. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time how BMP-2 signaling and its downstream transcription factors regulate Mepe gene transcription.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureMouse myogenic C2C12 cells and rat osteosarcoma cell line ROS 17/2.8 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and then osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells and Runx2−/− calvarial cell line H1-127-21-2 were maintained in α-MEM with 10% FBS as previously described (16Lee M.H.

For making a construct that bears a mutation in the putative Runx2 binding sites, a site-directed mutagenic PCR was performed with the −165 Mut and −127 Mut oligonucleotides for M-165 and M-127 (see Table 1 for the sequences) and the universal RVprimer3 (RV3) and GLprimer2 (GL2) listed in Table 1. The PCR products of the promoter mutation were digested with NheI and XhoI, and those were replaced with the wild-type counterpart of the reporter vector.Reverse Transcription PCR and Quantitative Real Time PCRConventional reverse transcription-PCR for murine Mepe and Phex was performed with the primers listed in Table 2. Quantitative real time PCR was performed using TaKaRa SYBR premix Ex Taq (Takara, Japan) on a Applied Biosystems 7500 real time PCR system (Foster City, CA). PCR primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology (Coralville, IA). All samples were run in duplicate, and the relative levels of Mepe mRNA were normalized to those of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh). The primer sets for real time PCR are listed in Table 2.TABLE 2Primer sequences for reverse transcription PCR and quantative real time PCR Open table in a new tab Knockdown Assay with siRNATo knock down Dlx5, Runx2, and Smad1/5 expression, siRNAs against Dlx5 and Runx2 (siGENOME SMART pool) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The siRNA against Smad1/5 was purchased from Invitrogen (StealthTM/siRNA duplex oligoribonucleotides). siGENOME Non-targeting siRNA-2 was used as a control (scramble siRNA). 60 or 40 pmol of siRNA was transfected by electroporation in MC3T3-E1 cells. After transfection, the cells were cultured for 36 h to 90% confluence and then treated with or without BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) for 24 h.Transient TransfectionC2C12 and MC3T3-E1 cells were plated in 100-mm plates and cultured up to 90% confluence. After harvesting the cells, a transfection by electroporation was performed using a Microporator (NanoEnTek, MA) with a 10-μl gold tip according to the manufacturer's instructions. ROS 17/2.8 cells were plated in a 96-well assay plate, and after overnight culture the cells were transfected with Hilymax (Dojindo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were performed with 0.5 μg of Dlx5 or Msx2 expression vector or pcDNA3.1 empty vector as a control and 0.15 μg of the Mepe promoter luciferase reporter vector. All plasmid DNA was prepared using a DNA Maxi-prep kit (GENOMED, Loehne, Germany).

These double-stranded DNA probes were end-labeled with [r-32P]ATP using the DNA 5′-end labeling system (Promega). Dlx5 and Msx2 proteins were produced by in vitro transcription and translation using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate (Promega). The Dlx5 and/or Msx2 proteins were incubated with the labeled, double-stranded DNA probes in the presence or absence of a 10-, 50-, and 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled competitor for 30 min at room temperature. For the Supershift assay, the Dlx5 proteins were preincubated with anti-HA antibody for 30 min at room temperature (we used the Dlx5 expression vector with the HA tag). The protein-DNA complexes were then separated at room temperature on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE buffer.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation AssaysThe chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as previously described (16Lee M.H.

Lee W.B. Kim H.J. Mi Woo K. Baek J.H. Choi J.Y. Hur C.G. Ryoo H.M. Gene. 2006; 372: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This microarray result was confirmed by conventional reverse transcriptase-PCR (Fig. 1A) and quantitative real time PCR analysis in which Mepe expression was found to be about 800-fold higher in bone tissue (data not shown). To understand the Mepe expression pattern in osteoblast differentiation, a long-term culture of MC3T3-E1 cells in osteogenic medium was performed, as previously described (18Choi J.Y. Lee B.H.

Mepe expression increased gradually until day 14 of culture, and then increased abruptly at day 21 when the culture underwent the mineralization process. The expression pattern of the other bone marker genes, especially osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein, clearly showed that the culture had undergone a typical osteoblast differentiation process and that there must have been significant mineralization between days 14 and 21 of the cell culture (Fig. 1B), which was verified by ALP and alizarin red staining of the MC3T3-E1 cells (supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 1.Mepe expression is bone cell-specific and increased during osteoblast differentiation. A, Mepe and Phex expression were determined by conventional reverse transcriptase-PCR using Gapdh as an internal control. B, MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured for 21 days in the osteogenic media (50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS). Mepe, Phex, and other bone marker gene expressions were determined by quantitative real time PCR, and their expression levels presented by the relative ΔCt value.

In addition, BMP R-Smads and Dlx5 are indispensable mediators of BMP-2-induced Runx2-II and alkaline phosphatase expression (17Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R. Kyung H.M. Sung J.H.

Mepe expression was dramatically (about 25-fold) increased by treatment of confluent MC3T3-E1 cells with BMP-2 (100 ng/ml). Also, Phex expression was increased by BMP-2 treatment (Fig. 2A). In the long-term culture of MC3T3-E1 cells, the increase of Mepe expression and the decrease of Phex expression intersected around day 11 (Fig. 2B, arrow indicating “−” in the x axis). Even if the expression of both genes was commonly stimulated by BMP-2, the intersection point was advanced to day 9 (Fig. 2B, arrow indicating “+” in the x axis). In the case of MC3T3-E1 cells, basal Mepe expression was much higher, at least 26-fold higher than in C2C12 cells. However, the basal Mepe gene expression in C2C12 cells was not detectable in the 40 cycles of real time PCR. Moreover, even after treatment of BMP-2, the Mepe expression level in C2C12 cells was much lower than that in untreated MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 2C), indicating that gene expression is bone cell-specific. In this culture, the bone marker gene Alp expression was increased, whereas myoblast marker gene MyoD expression was decreased by BMP-2 (data not shown). BMP-2 treatment in MC3T3-E1 cells increased the level of phosphorylated BMP R-Smads (Smad 1/5/8), which subsequently stimulated Dlx5 and Mepe mRNA levels, as previously demonstrated (17Lee M.H. Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. Park H.D. Kang A.R. Kyung H.M. Sung J.H. Wozney J.M. Kim H.J. Ryoo H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34387-34394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The knockdown of BMP R-Smads by siRNA treatment clearly indicates that Dlx5 and Mepe are common downstream targets of activated BMP R-Smads (Fig. 3A). The overexpression of Dlx5 strongly stimulated Mepe mRNA expression, demonstrating an additive effect with BMP-2 treatment (Fig. 3B). In contrast, knockdown of Dlx5 by siRNA dramatically reversed BMP-2-stimulated Mepe mRNA expression (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 2.Mepe expression is induced by BMP-2 exclusively in the bone cell. A, MC3T3-E1 cells cultured in α-MEM were treated with BMP-2 (100 ng/ml) for 1 day. Mepe and Phex expression were determined by quantitative real time PCR. B, MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured for 21 days in the osteogenic media (α-MEM supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) with (+BMP2) or without (−BMP2) BMP-2 treatment (100 ng/ml) once for 3 days, and then the medium was changed every 2 to 3 days without additional treatment with BMP-2.

https://openalex.org/W2063478935,"In yeast, trehalose is synthesized by a multimeric enzymatic complex: TPS1 encodes trehalose 6-phosphate synthase, which belongs to a complex that is composed of at least three other subunits, including trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase Tps2 and the redundant regulatory subunits Tps3 and Tsl1. The product of the TPS1 gene plays an essential role in the control of the glycolytic pathway by restricting the influx of glucose into glycolysis. In this paper, we investigated whether the trehalose synthesis pathway could be involved in the control of the other energy-generating pathway: oxidative phosphorylation. We show that the different mutants of the trehalose synthesis pathway (tps1Delta, tps2Delta, and tps1,2Delta) exhibit modulation in the amount of respiratory chains, in terms of cytochrome content and maximal respiratory activity. Furthermore, these variations in mitochondrial enzymatic content are positively linked to the intracellular concentration in cAMP that is modulated by Tps1p through hexokinase2. This is the first time that a pathway involved in sugar storage, i.e. trehalose, is shown to regulate the mitochondrial enzymatic content."
https://openalex.org/W2110158778,"The symbiosis between zooxanthellae (dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium) and corals is a fundamental basis of tropical marine ecosystems. However the physiological interactions of the hosts and symbionts are poorly understood. Recently, intracellular crystalline deposits in Symbiodinium were revealed to be uric acid functioning for nutrient storage. This is the first exploration of these enigmatic crystalline materials that had previously been misidentified as oxalic acid, providing new insights into the nutritional strategies of Symbiodinium in oligotrophic tropical waters. However, we believe these deposits also function as eye-spots on the basis of light and electron microscopic observations of motile cells of cultured Symbiodinium. The cells possessed crystalline deposit clusters in rows with each row 100–150 nm thick corresponding to 1/4 the wavelength of light and making them suitable for maximum wave interference and reflection of light. Crystalline clusters in cells observed with a light microscope strongly refracted and polarized light, and reflected or absorbed short wavelength light. The facts that purines, including uric acid, have been identified as the main constituents of light reflectors in many organisms, and that the photoreceptor protein, opsin, was detected in our Symbiodinium strain, support the idea that uric acid deposits in Symbiodinium motile cells may function as a component of an eye-spot."
https://openalex.org/W1982189746,"Starfish oocytes are arrested at the first prophase of meiosis until they are stimulated by 1-methyladenine (1-MA). The two most immediate responses to the maturation-inducing hormone are the quick release of intracellular Ca(2+) and the accelerated changes of the actin cytoskeleton in the cortex. Compared with the later events of oocyte maturation such as germinal vesicle breakdown, the molecular mechanisms underlying the early events involving Ca(2+) signaling and actin changes are poorly understood. Herein, we have studied the roles of G-proteins in the early stage of meiotic maturation.By microinjecting starfish oocytes with nonhydrolyzable nucleotides that stabilize either active (GTPgammaS) or inactive (GDPbetaS) forms of G-proteins, we have demonstrated that: i) GTPgammaS induces Ca(2+) release that mimics the effect of 1-MA; ii) GDPbetaS completely blocks 1-MA-induced Ca(2+); iii) GDPbetaS has little effect on the amplitude of the Ca(2+) peak, but significantly expedites the initial Ca(2+) waves induced by InsP(3) photoactivation, iv) GDPbetaS induces unexpectedly striking modification of the cortical actin networks, suggesting a link between the cytoskeletal change and the modulation of the Ca(2+) release kinetics; v) alteration of cortical actin networks with jasplakinolide, GDPbetaS, or actinase E, all led to significant changes of 1-MA-induced Ca(2+) signaling.Taken together, these results indicate that G-proteins are implicated in the early events of meiotic maturation and support our previous proposal that the dynamic change of the actin cytoskeleton may play a regulatory role in modulating intracellular Ca(2+) release."
https://openalex.org/W1986569186,"Polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyVmT) is a powerful viral oncogene; however, the mechanisms of PyVmT activation are poorly understood. The insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) are known to be implicated in the development of many cancers. Furthermore, PyVmT-overexpressing mouse mammary carcinoma Met-1 cells are highly responsive to IGF-I and insulin. Herein, we demonstrate that PyVmT physically interacts with IGF-IR and IR in Met-1 cells. Insulin and IGF-I increase association of the IR and IGF-IR with PyVmT, enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of PyVmT and augment the recruitment of Src and PLCγ1 to PyVmT. This is accompanied by robust and sustained phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2, which are implicated in both PyVmT and IGF-IR/IR signalling. Both ligands significantly increase proliferation, survival, migration and invasion of Met-1 cells. Furthermore, orthotopic inoculation of Met-1 cells with shRNAmir-mediated knockdown of IR or IGF-IR fails to initiate tumour growth in recipient mice. In conclusion, our data indicate that the physical and functional interaction between PyVmT and cellular receptor tyrosine kinases, including IR and IGF-IR, is critical for PyVmT activation and tumour initiation. These results also provide a novel mechanism for oncogene activation in the host cell."

The fdmM and fdmM1 genes code for two proteins with high sequence homology to each other but unknown function. In-frame deletion of each of the genes from the fdm cluster was accomplished in the S. albus host.

Studies on natural product biosynthetic pathways have uncovered a number of intriguing oxygenases. For instance, the first reported metal- and cofactor-free monooxygenase TcmH is responsible for quinone moiety formation in tetracenomycin D3 and represents a rapidly growing family of antibiotic biosynthetic monooxygenases (1Shen B.

Another example is DpgC, which is involved in the biosynthesis of vancomycin building block 3, 5-dihydroxyphenylglycine. The crystal structure of DpgC has been used to understand the reaction mechanism of metal- and cofactor-free dioxygenases (3Widboom P.F. Fielding E.N. Liu Y. Bruner S.D.

The highly oxidized nature of these molecules suggests their biosynthetic pathways as potential resources for the discovery of new oxygenases. We have recently cloned and sequenced the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 from Streptomyces griseus ATCC 49344, proposing that 1 is derived from a pentadecaketide core structure (7) (Fig. 1).

These include Prm-Orf5 (29.5% identity to FdmM, 42.3% identity to FdmM1) in the pradimicin A (2) biosynthetic pathway (7Kim B.C. Lee J.M. Ahn J.S. Kim B.S. J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 17: 830-839PubMed Google Scholar), LlpB (30.1% identity to FdmM, 50% identity to FdmM1), and LlpQ (41.2% identity to FdmM, 36.1% identity to FdmM1) in the lysolipin X (3) biosynthetic pathway (8Bockholt H. Udvarnoki G. Rohr J. Mocek U. Beale J.M. Floss H.G. J. Org. Chem. 1994; 59: 2064-2069Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), GrhM (42.2% identity to FdmM, 31% identity to FdmM1) in the griseorhodin A (4) biosynthetic pathway (9Li A. Piel J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), BenG (28.6% identity to FdmM, 26.5% identity to FdmM1) in the benastatin A (5) biosynthetic pathway (10Xu Z. Schenk A. Hertweck C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 6022-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and RubQ (43.8% identity to FdmM, 31.6% identity to FdmM1) in the γ-rubromycin (6) biosynthetic pathway (supplemental Fig. S1 and Ref. 11Martin R. Sterner O. Alvarez M.A. de Clercq E. Bailey J.E. Minas W. J. Antibiot. 2001; 54: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Like 1, inspection of those aromatic polyketides reveals the crucial role of oxygenation in their biosynthesis (Fig. 1). It should be noted that although no oxygenation is needed in the biosynthesis of benastatin (5), its biosynthetic congener BE43767A (11) contains a C-8 hydroxyl group (15Schenk A. Xu Z. Pfeiffer C. Steinbeck C. Hertweck C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007; 46: 7035-7038Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We report here in vivo investigations of the roles of FdmM and FdmM1 in the biosynthesis of 1 by (i) construction of ΔfdmM and ΔfdmM1 mutants, respectively and (ii) structural characterization of the accumulated metabolites for each mutant. These data provide new insights into the biosynthesis of 1 and unveil FdmM and FdmM1 as members of an emerging family of novel oxygenases involved in aromatic polyketide biosynthesis. IR spectra were measured on a Bruker EQUINOX 55/S FT-IR/NIR spectrophotometer (Ettlingen). Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) or high-resolution (HR) ESI-MS was performed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC-MSDSL ion trap mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA). Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectroscopy (APCI-MS) was performed on an Agilent 1100 VL APCI mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA). HR Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Fourier Transform (MALDI-FT)-MS was measured on an IonSpec HiResMALDI FT mass spectrometer (Lake Forest, CA). NMR data were obtained using a Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz NMR spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA). Analytical or semi-preparative HPLC was carried on a Varian HPLC system with in-line Prostar 330 PDA detector (Woburn, MA). The cytotoxity assay of FDM compounds was performed as described previously (14Chen Y. Luo Y. Ju J. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Rajski S.R. Shen B. J. Nat. Prod. 2008; 71: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Streptomyces albus J1074 was used as heterologous expression host (12Wendt-Pienkowski E. Huang Y. Zhang J. Li B. Jiang H. Kwon H. Hutchinson C.R. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16442-16452Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For protoplast preparation, S. albus was grown in YEME medium (16Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000Google Scholar). Escherichia coli ET12567/pUZ8002 (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) and BW25113 (18Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) were used for intergeneric conjugation and λ RED-mediated PCR-targeting mutagenesis, respectively. S. albus recombinant strains were cultured in R2YE medium to prepare seed cultures, and then inoculated to production medium and cultured at 28 °C, 250 rpm for FDM production as described previously (12Wendt-Pienkowski E. Huang Y. Zhang J. Li B. Jiang H. Kwon H. Hutchinson C.R. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16442-16452Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The production medium consisted of 8 g of yeast extract, 20 g of malt extract, 2 g of NaCl, 10 g of MOPS sodium salt in 500 ml of tap water, and 380 ml of Milli-Q® water (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA). After autoclaving, 1 ml of 10% MgSO4, 1 ml of 1% FeSO4, 0.1 ml of 10% ZnSO4, and 120 ml of 50% glucose were added. The concentrations of antibiotics used for selection were ampicillin (100 μg/ml), apramycin (50 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml), and thiostrepton (10 μg/ml) (16Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000Google Scholar). General DNA manipulations were performed as described (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). MYME was used for genomic DNA isolation (16Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000Google Scholar). Protoplast transformation and intergeneric conjugation were performed as previously described (19Chen Y. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Shen B. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5587-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PCR reactions were performed with the GoTaq DNA polymerase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) or Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). λ RED-mediated recombination was carried out according to the standard procedure (18Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Plasmids pSET152, pWHM1250, pKC1218, and pBS4028 were described previously (19Chen Y. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Shen B. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5587-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The inactivation of fdmM and fdmM1 took advantage of the successful heterologous expression of the fdm cluster carried by pBS4028 in S. albus (12Wendt-Pienkowski E. Huang Y. Zhang J. Li B. Jiang H. Kwon H. Hutchinson C.R. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16442-16452Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The fdmM gene in pBS4028 was disrupted by replacing a 0.4-kb fragment internal fdmM with the 1.4-kb aac(3)IV+oriT cassette through λ RED-mediated recombination; the primers fdmMf and fdmMr (supplemental Table S1) were used for cloning the aac(3)IV+oriT cassette used in fdmM inactivation. The ΔfdmM in-frame-deleted fdm heterologous expression plasmid pBS4052 was obtained by excising the aac(3)IV+oriT cassette with XbaI and self-ligation. Correct construction of pBS4052 was confirmed by DNA sequencing and PCR using primers fdmMM1a and fdmMM1b (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. S2). The ΔfdmM recombinant mutant strain SB4021 was afforded by transforming pBS4052 into S. albus J1074. The ΔfdmM1 in-frame-deleted fdm heterologous plasmid pBS4053 was constructed from pBS4028 in a similar way as pBS4052 using the primers fdmM1f and fdmM1r (supplemental Table S1). Following confirmation by sequencing and PCR using fdmMM1a and fdmMM1b as primers (supplemental Table S1), pBS4053 was transformed to S. albus to afford the ΔfdmM1 recombinant mutant strain SB4022 (supplemental Fig. S3). The 2.5-kb BamHI/NcoI fragment containing fdmKLM was excised and inserted into the same sites of pET28a. The resultant plasmid was cut off a 0.7-kb ApaLI fragment and self-ligated. Then, the entire fdmM gene together with its native promoter was removed as a 1.9-kb EcoRI/XbaI fragment and inserted into the same sites of pKC1218 to generate pBS4054. Plasmid pBS4054 was introduced into SB4021 by E. coli-Streptomyces conjugation, affording the ΔfdmM-complemented strain SB4023. The 1.0-kb EcoRV/KpnI fragment, containing fdmM1 and its native promoter, was inserted into the same sites of pET29a. The same locus was then removed as a 1.1-kb EcoRI/XbaI fragment and inserted into the same sites of pKC1218 to yield pBS4055. Introduction of pBS4055 into SB4021 finally afforded the ΔfdmM1 complemented strain SB4024. Plasmid pBS4045 (19Chen Y. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Shen B. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5587-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was cut by HindIII and blunted by DNA polymerase I large (Klenow) fragment (Promega). A 2.5-kb fragment containing fdmR1 downstream of ErmE* promoter was excised by EcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI/EcoRV sites of pSET152 to generate pBS4056. Introducing pBS4056 into SB4021 and SB4022 by E. coli-Streptomyces conjugation afforded SB4025 and SB4026, respectively. Growth of S. albus SB4025 to produce 12, 13, and 14 was done in a fashion similar to that for FDM production in S. griseus (14Chen Y. Luo Y. Ju J. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Rajski S.R. Shen B. J. Nat. Prod. 2008; 71: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the seed cultures were prepared by inoculating spores into R2YE medium and growing at 28 °C, 250 rpm for 1 day, added to the production medium (2%, v/v), and the resulting cultures were grown for 8 days under the same conditions. For preparation of compound 12 cultures were grown for 5 days instead of the usual 8 days. Cultures were acidified to pH 2.0 with 2 m HCl and centrifuged. The pellet (mycelia and any other precipitate) was harvested and extracted three times with acetone. Following solvent removal in vacuo, the resulting residue was extracted with EtOAc three times. Solvent removal in vacuo was followed by chromatography over a polyamide 6 column (Fluka, Steinheim, Germany) using CHCl3-MeOH-HCO2H (500:0:0, 230:20:0, 200:50:0, 200:50:0.1, and 400:100:1.0). Compound 14 was eluted by CHCl3-MeOH-HCO2H 200:50:0.1. However, 14 could not be cleanly separated from 13. Compounds 12 and 13 were co-eluted by CHCl3-MeOH-HCO2H 400:100:1.0. Fractions containing any one of the three compounds were concentrated and subjected to silica gel chromatography (230–400 mesh, Natland Inc., Morrisville, NC) eluted with CHCl3-MeOH-AcOH (250:0:0, 240:10:0, 230:20:0, 210:40:0, 200:50:0, and 200:50:0.5). Compound 14 was eluted by CHCl3-MeOH-AcOH 210:40:0, 12 was eluted by CHCl3-MeOH-AcOH 200:50:0, and 13 was eluted by CHCl3-MeOH-AcOH 200:50:0.5. Fractions were concentrated and resolved by semi-preparative HPLC on an Alltima C18 column (5 μm, 250 × 10 mm, Alltech, Deerfield, IL), eluted as described previously (14Chen Y. Luo Y. Ju J. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Rajski S.R. Shen B. J. Nat. Prod. 2008; 71: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Solvents tested for NMR data collection of 13 included acetone, MeOD, CDCl3, MeOD-CDCl3 in different ratios, DMSO, DMF, pyridine, and trifluoroacetic acid. Compound 15 was produced by SB4026 using the same culture procedures described for SB4025. Isolation of 15 was executed using the same procedure applied to 13 and 14, except that 15 was eluted from the polyamide 6 column with a solvent of 200:50:1.0 (CHCl3-MeOH-HCO2H). When subjected to silica gel chromatography, 15 was eluted by CHCl3-MeOH-AcOH 140:60:0.4 and was completely eluted by a solvent ratio of 140:60:1.0. Partially purified 15 was further refined by semi-preparative HPLC affording pure 15 for NMR spectroscopy. 12, isolated as a yellow solid, afforded IR νmax (CHCl3) at 3409, 2933, 2851, 1617, 1594, 1437, 1377, 1354, 1259, 1191, 1143, 1073, 1001, 951, 808, 767, 704, 674 cm−1. APCI-MS yielded [M-H2O+H]+ and [M-H]− ions at m/z 525 and 541, respectively, and HR-ESI-MS yielded an [M-H]− ion at m/z 541.1479 (541.1504 calculated for the [M-H]− ion of molecular formula C31H25O9).

Open table in a new tab 13, isolated as a purple solid, afforded IR νmax (CHCl3) at 3431, 2906, 2832, 1772, 1684, 1593, 1489, 1437, 1376, 1355, 1276, 1236, 1206, 1141, 1073, 1025, 845, 803, 760, 725, 674 cm−1. APCI-MS yielded [M+H]+ and [M-H]− ions at m/z 541 and 539, respectively, and HR-ESI-MS yielded an [M-H]− ion at m/z 539.1321 (539.1348 calculated for the [M-H]− ion of molecular formula C31H23O9). For NMR data, see Table 1. 14, isolated as a red solid, afforded IR νmax (CHCl3) at 3177, 3021, 2939, 2845, 1869, 1771, 1718, 1676, 1660, 1592, 1475, 1435, 1402, 1378, 1366, 1313, 1260, 1205, 1189, 1166, 1129, 1098, 1070, 998, 986, 952, 892, 823, 786, 763, 745, 707, 687 cm−1. APCI-MS yielded [M+H]+ and [M-H]− ions at m/z 557 and 555, respectively, and HR-ESI-MS yielded an [M-H]− ion at m/z 555.1273 (557.1297 calculated for the [M-H]− ion of molecular formula C31H23O10). For NMR data, see Table 1. 15, isolated as a dark blue solid, afforded IR νmax (CHCl3) at 3385, 3223, 3016, 2941, 2843, 1664, 1599, 1437, 1387, 1254, 1234, 1197, 1115, 1069, 1023, 1000, 952, 852, 791, 755, 680, 665 cm−1. APCI-MS yielded an [M+H]+ ion at m/z 557, and HR-ESI-MS yielded [M-H]− ion at m/z 555.1269 (557.1297 calculated for the [M-H]− ion of molecular formula C31H23O10). For NMR data, see Table 1 and supplemental Table S1. 16, isolated as a brown solid, afforded IR νmax (CHCl3) at 3384, 3015, 2880, 2837, 1684, 1618, 1558, 1490, 1437, 1320, 1204, 1146, 1025, 954, 801, 765, 722, 708, 688 cm−1.

For NMR data, see Table 1. 18, isolated as a dark red solid, afforded IR νmax (CHCl3) at 3429, 2983, 2905, 2842, 1869, 1783, 1684, 1618, 1559, 1542, 1521, 1507, 1474, 1458, 1437, 1407, 1376, 1314, 1260, 1208, 1165, 1145, 1016, 988, 962, 844, 804, 760, 725, 674 cm−1. APCI-MS yielded an [M+H]+ ion at m/z 539, and HR-MALDI-FT-MS yielded [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+ ions at m/z 539.1325 and 561.1148, respectively, (539.1337 and 561.1156 calculated for the [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+ ions, respectively, of molecular formula C31H23O9). For NMR data, see Table 1. Inactivation of both fdmM and fdmM1 was carried out on the basis of successful heterologous expression of the fdm cluster in S. albus (12Wendt-Pienkowski E. Huang Y. Zhang J. Li B. Jiang H. Kwon H. Hutchinson C.R. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16442-16452Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For fdmM, a 0.4-kb internal fragment of fdmM was replaced by the aac(3)IV+oriT cassette through λ RED-mediated PCR-targeting protocol (18Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) in plasmid pBS4028 (19Chen Y. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Shen B. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5587-5596Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cassette was then removed by XbaI leaving an 81-bp scar in the resultant construct pBS4052. The ΔfdmM in-frame deletion recombinant mutant strain SB4021 was generated by transforming pBS4052 into S. albus. When cultured in production medium, SB4021 failed to produce 1 and 10 but instead yielded three new compounds FDM M-1 (12), FDM M-2 (13), and FDM M-3 (14) in very low titer. SB4021 was complemented by in trans expression of fdmM with its native promoter to afford SB4023, in which production of 1 and 10 was restored with the concomitant disappearance of 12, 13, and 14. Titers of 12, 13, and 14 were dramatically increased (>12-fold) by overexpression of an fdm pathway specific activator fdmR1 (19Chen Y. Wendt-Pienkowski E. Shen B. J.

The titer enhancement in SB4025 vastly hastened isolation and characterization of the three accumulated compounds. The ΔfdmM1 in-frame deletion expression plasmid pBS4053 was constructed from pBS4028 in a fashion similar to that used to make pBS4052, affording the mutated fdm cluster with a 0.4-kb internal fragment of fdmM1 being substituted with an 81-bp scar. Transformation of pBS4053 into S. albus afforded the ΔfdmM1 in-frame deletion recombinant mutant strain SB4022, in which production of 1 and 10 was abolished. HPLC analysis of the SB4022 metabolite profile revealed two minor peaks at 12.8 and 15.4 min. When the activator FdmR1 was overproduced in SB4022 to afford SB4026, the titer of FDM M1-1 (15), with retention time at 12.8 min, was increased by ∼25-fold. In contrast, there was almost no change for the compound eluting at 15.4 min in SB4022 and SB4026, implying that this compound has no relationship to the fdm biosynthetic pathway. Complementation of the ΔfdmM1 mutation was achieved by introducing a plasmid, pBS4055 carrying fdmM1 with its native promoter into SB4022, restoring the production of both 1 and 10 (Fig. 3b). Compounds 12, 13, and 14 were extracted from the pellet of acidified SB4025 culture with acetone. Following re-extraction with ethyl acetate, the concentrated extract was subjected to several rounds of chromatography. The three compounds were separated by silica gel chromatography and refined using semi-preparative reverse phase HPLC. Compounds 12, 13, and 14 were isolated as yellow, purple, and red solids, respectively. Compound 12 was found to be very unstable; compounds 13 and 14 showed extremely poor solubility in almost all common solvents. HR ESI-MS analysis of analytically pure 13 afforded an [M-H]− ion at m/z 539.1321 consistent with the molecular formula C31H23O9 (calculated 539.1348 for the [M-H]− ion). The limited solubility of 13 dictated that only 1H NMR data of this molecule could be obtained (Table 1). After exhaustive testing, 13 was found to be soluble in trifluor"

Tax1-mediated growth promotion is thought to result from, at least in part, up-regulation of genes for growth factors and their receptors that induce T-cell growth. In the present study, we demonstrate that Tax1 transactivates the interleukin-21 (IL-21) and its receptor (IL-21R) genes in human T-cells. Introduction of Tax1 via recombinant adenoviruses induced expression of endogenous IL-21 and IL-21R. Isolated promoters of the IL-21 and IL-21R genes were activated by Tax1 in reporter assays, which further revealed that there were at least two Tax1-responsive elements in either the IL-21 promoter or the IL-21R promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and gel mobility shift assay exhibited that the IL-21 promoter elements bound transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB, and the IL-21R promoter elements were associated with AP-1 and interferon regulatory factor. Collectively, Tax1-dependent activation of these transcriptional factors presumably contributes to expression of the IL-21 gene and its receptor gene. The related virus HTLV-2 with Tax2 similar to Tax1 is known not to be pathogenic. Tax2 exhibited little, if any, or no induction of the IL-21 transcription in CD4+ T-cells, in contrast to Tax1.

At the early stages of ATL development, HTLV-1-infected T-cells may induce their proliferation in two ways: Tax1 directly activates genes for cell growth such as cyclin D2, cdk4, and cdk6, leading to progression of the cell cycle (7Haller K.

Inducible and transient expression of cytokines is crucial for proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes. Early studies demonstrated that HTLV-1 infection promoted expression of various cytokines and their receptors, most notably the T-cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL-2) (11Good L. Maggirwar S.B. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Hoyos B. Ballard D.W. Böhnlein E. Siekevitz M. Greene W.C.

Holbrook N.J. Wong-Staal F. Leonard W.J. Cell. 1987; 49: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Induction of the IL-2 and IL-2Rα genes in HTLV-1-infected cells is thought to be induced by Tax1 through activation of the NF-AT and NF-κB pathways, respectively (11Good L. Maggirwar S.B. Sun S.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Hoyos B. Ballard D.W. Böhnlein E. Siekevitz M. Greene W.C.

Science. 1988; 241: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition to intrinsic cell cycle progression induced by Tax1, Tax1-mediated expression of IL-2 and IL-2Rα has been believed to contribute to ATL development by increased frequency of cell growth of infected cells. HTLV-2 is closely related to HTLV-1 in genetic and biological terms, showing ∼70% sequence homology with each other (15Feuer G. Green P.L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5996-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, no link has been reported between infection with HTLV-2 and the development of ATL or another malignancies. HTLV-2 encodes Tax2, which shows ∼75% sequence homology to Tax1. Tax1 and Tax2 have been shown to play critical roles in immortalization of T-cells and maintenance of persistent infection with these viruses in human T-cells (16Ross T.M. Pettiford S.M. Green P.L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5194-5202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Robek M.D. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4856-4865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that Tax2 induces expression of IL-2, which promotes proliferation of HTLV-2-infected T-cell lines, but Tax1 does not transactivate the IL-2 gene (18Niinuma A. Higuchi M. Takahashi M. Oie M. Tanaka Y. Gejyo F. Tanaka N. Sugamura K. Xie L. Green P.L. Fujii M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11925-11934Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The findings prompted us to reconsider the notion that IL-2 autocrine loop supports cell proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T-cells. We thus wondered whether Tax1 induces IL-21 and its receptor (IL-21R), because IL-21, which is produced by activated CD4+ T-cells, effectively induces proliferation of T-cells in cooperation with other cytokines (19Parrish-Novak J. Dillon S.R. Nelson A. Hammond A. Sprecher C. Gross J.A. Johnston J. Madden K. Xu W. West J. Schrader S. Burkhead S. Heipel M. Brandt C. Kuijper J.L. Kramer J. Conklin D. Presnell S.R. Berry J.

Int. Immunol. 2007; 19: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to IL-2 and IL-15, which are close to IL-21 in terms of biological activity and receptor constitution, IL-21 activates intracellular signaling pathways required for proliferation of T-cells through binding to its receptor, a complex consisting of two subunits, IL-21R and the common γ-chain (21Asao H. Okuyama C. Kumaki S. Ishii N. Tsuchiya S. Foster D. Sugamura K. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The common γ-chain is shared receptor complexes for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 besides IL-21. Among subunits of these receptor complexes, IL-2Rα, common γ-chain, and IL-15Rα are shown to be activated by Tax1 (14Cross S.L. Feinberg M.B. Wolf J.B. Holbrook N.J. Wong-Staal F. Leonard W.J.

In this study, we examined the effects of Tax1 and Tax2 on expression of the IL-21 and IL-21R genes and found that Tax1 induced the both genes in human T-cells. Moreover, our results indicated that Tax2 is distinct from Tax1 in effects on IL-21 gene expression in CD4+ T-cells. These observations imply that Tax1-mediated expression of the IL-21 and IL-21R genes may be involved in HTLV-1 pathogenesis. A human acute lymphocytic leukemia T-cell line Jurkat and its derivatives JPX-9 and JPX/M are maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. JPX-9 and JPX/M carry the Tax1 wild type and nonfunctional Tax1 mutant genes, respectively, under the control of the metallothionein promoter (25Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Saito S. Nagata K. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1589-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Expression of Tax1 or its mutant was induced by the addition of 20 μm CdCl2. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were obtained from a consenting healthy adult by discontinuous density gradient sedimentation using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare). CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were separately enriched more than 92% from PBLs with CD4+ and CD8+ T Cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotec), respectively. PBLs and CD4+ and CD8+ enriched populations were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% fetal calf serum with 10 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA). 5′ RACE was performed using the GeneRacer Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was isolated from PBLs treated with PHA for 72 h. The 5′ ends of cDNA were amplified by PCR with GeneRacer 5′ Primer (Invitrogen) and the following gene-specific primers: reverse IL-21 primer, 5′- agctggcagaaattcagggaccaag-3′; reverse IL-21 nested primer, 5′-gtggaccagtgtccccaagaagatg-3′; reverse IL-21R primer, 5′-catactggtcttgccaggtaagggtga-3′; and reverse IL-21R nested primer, 5′-agcagcagcaggagcaagggggc-3′. The PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript II SK(−) vector (Stratagene), and the nucleotide sequences were determined. Expression vectors based on the human β-actin promoter for Tax1 (pMT-2Tax) and Tax2B (pHβAP-r-1-neoTax2B), whose original Tax2B clone was kindly provided by Dr. Hall, were described previously (26Matsumoto K.

Kaplan M.H. Hall W.W. Virology. 2000; 271: 142-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). pHβAP-r-1-neo was used as a control plasmid (28Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The fragment (−723 to +34) upstream of the IL-21 gene first exon was inserted in front of the luciferase gene in the reporter plasmid pGL3-basic (Promega), yielding pIL-21(−723)Luc. pIL-21R(−791)Luc was constructed by insertion of the 5′ regulatory region (−791 to +77) of the human IL-21R gene into the reporter plasmid pGL3-basic. Total RNA was extracted using Isogen (Nippon Gene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA was synthesized using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit for reverse transcription-PCR (AMV; Roche Applied Science) according to the supplier's protocol. Quantitative detection of mRNA for IL-2, IL-21, IL-21R, and Tax were performed by quantitative PCR with LightCycler (Roche Applied Science). Oligonucleotide primers used for IL-21R detection were as follows: forward, 5′-acatccctagggctctgtgatg-3′; reverse, 5′-gagcagcagcaggagcaagggg-3′; and TaqMan probe, 5′-gtgggagtcagcatgccgcgt-TAMRA-3′. The primers and probe for IL-21 were described elsewhere (19Parrish-Novak J. Dillon S.R. Nelson A. Hammond A. Sprecher C. Gross J.A. Johnston J. Madden K. Xu W. West J. Schrader S. Burkhead S.

Expression levels of Tax1 and Tax2 mRNA were measured with a set of primers: forward, 5′-tccttccccacccagagaac-3′; reverse, 5′-atggggggggaaagctggta-3′; and FastStart DNA Master SYBER Green (Roche Applied Science). The primers for 18 S rRNA were obtained from TaKaRa. To generate standard curves for IL-21, IL-21R, and Tax mRNA, quantitative PCR was performed with serially diluted samples of plasmids, which carry the 511-bp IL-21 cDNA fragment (pEFneohIL21) (29Rahman M. Nara H. Onoda T. Araki A. Li J. Hoshino T. Asao H. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4001-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the 124-bp (+1 to +124; see Fig. 5A) IL-21R cDNA fragment in pBluescript II, and the 1062-bp Tax1 fragment (pMT-2Tax), respectively. An IL-2 standard curve was similarly determined with commercially available products (Roche Applied Science). The copy numbers of IL-21, IL-21R, IL-2, and Tax mRNA were calculated based on respective standard curves and normalized against 18 S rRNA amounts, which were determined by quantitative PCR with the 123-base 18 S rRNA-derived single-stranded cDNA with the following primers: forward, 5′-actcaacacgggaaacctca-3′; and reverse, 5′-aaccagacaaatcgctccac-3′. PBLs were stimulated with PHA for 72 h, washed with serum-free RPMI 1640, and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 20% fetal calf serum for 48 h. The cells were infected with Tax1- and Tax2B-expressing recombinant adenoviruses or control virus (Ad-Con) at multiples of 100 plaque-forming units/cell as described (30Hirai H. Fujisawa J. Suzuki T.

Recombinant adenoviruses for Tax1 (AxCAIY-Tax) and its mutant derivative Taxd17/5 (AxCAIY-Taxd17/5) were kindly provided by Dr. Yoshida (30Hirai H. Fujisawa J. Suzuki T. Ueda K. Muramatsu M. Tsuboi A. Arai N. Yoshida M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1737-1742PubMed Google Scholar). Another recombinant adenoviruses for Tax1 and Tax2B were newly generated using the ViraPowerTM adenoviral expression system (Invitrogen) with the CAG promoter (kindly provided by Dr. Miyazaki) according to the supplier's protocol, yielding Ad-Tax1 and Ad-Tax2B, respectively. The cells were lysed in the radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. The cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Atto). The membranes were soaked in 5% skim milk solution and further incubated with antibodies specific for Tax1 ((Lt-4) (32Lee B. Tanaka Y. Tozawa H. Tohoku J. Exp.

The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare), and proteins were detected by the ECL plus Western blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

The cells were then analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson). Expression and reporter plasmids were introduced into asynchronously growing Jurkat cells by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (36Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Saito S. Noda T. Ito Y. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured for 48 h, and luciferase activities were measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Luciferase activities were normalized relative to protein concentration that was measured by using the DC protein assay kit (Bio Rad). All of the assays were performed at least three times in duplicate, and the means ± S.E. are presented. Nuclear cell extracts were prepared from Jurkat cells, and gel mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (37Nakamura M. Niki M. Nagata K. Ohtani K. Saito S. Hinuma Y. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20189-20192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (7.5 μg of protein) were preincubated in 20 μl of a reaction mixture of 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (GE Healthcare) for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction mix was then incubated with α-32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes (50,000 cpm) for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis using a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.25× TBE buffer (22.3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 22.3 mm boric acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA).

Approximately 1 × 108 Jurkat cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde solution in culture medium for 7 min. Soluble chromatin was prepared and purified as described (41Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin was fragmented by sonication to ranging from 700 to 400 bp of DNA, precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), and followed by immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of antibodies. DNA fragments purified from the immunoprecipitates were subjected to PCR with the following primer sets: IL-21 promoter forward, 5′-gcctctcctcctacttttatgatg-3′, and reverse, 5′-accttggtctcgttttcact-3′; IL-21R promoter forward, 5′-ctcacagcctcttcttcact-5′, and reverse, 5′-ggtacctgctgcttctgcct-3′; and human β-actin promoter forward, 5′-ctccctcctcctcttcctcaatct-3′, and reverse, 5′-cgtcgcgccgctgggttttat-3′. Quantitative PCR was performed by using FastStart DNA Master SYBER Green with the set of primers described above. The assay was repeated at least three times, and the results were expressed as the means ± S.E. The antibodies used for the ChIP assays were anti-p50 (sc-114X), anti-p52 (sc-298X), anti-c-Rel (sc-1827X), anti-RelB (sc-226X), anti-JunD (sc-074X), anti-Fra2 (sc-604X), anti-IRF-1 (sc-497X), anti-IRF-4 (sc-6059X), and anti-p21 (sc-397) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A paired t test was performed for statistical analysis. p values less than 0.05 are considered to be significant. Stimulation of normal human PBLs with phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin has been reported to induce IL-21 and IL-21R gene expression, leading to growth of T-cells (19Parrish-Novak J.

PBLs or Jurkat cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing Tax1 or its mutant derivative Taxd17/5 that lacks the transactivation ability, and the levels of IL-21 and IL-21R mRNA were measured by means of quantitative PCR. Tax1 significantly increased IL-21 mRNA expression in PBLs and Jurkat cells, whereas the Tax1 mutant was not effective in the elevation of IL-21 mRNA expression (Fig. 1, A and C). Expression of the IL-21R gene was also greatly enhanced upon introduction of Tax1, but not Taxd17/5, in Jurkat cells, which expressed no or little, if any, IL-21R mRNA in normal culture conditions (Fig. 1D). Tax1 was also effective in an increase in IL-21R mRNA expression in PBLs, even though PBLs constitutively express IL-21R mRNA (Fig. 1B) (19Parrish-Novak J. Dillon S.R. Nelson A. Hammond A. Sprecher C. Gross J.A. Johnston J. Madden K. Xu W. West J. Schrader S. Burkhead S. Heipel M. Brandt C. Kuijper J.L. Kramer J. Conklin D. Presnell S.R. Berry J. Shiota F. Bort S. Hambly K. Mudri S.

Nature. 2000; 408: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Tax1 potentially induces IL-21 and IL-21R gene expression in human T-cells. To assess the functional significance of Tax1-mediated IL-21R gene expression, cell surface expression of IL-21R was examined by flow cytometric analysis. Jurkat derivatives JPX-9 and JPX/M were used to take advantage of inducible expression of Tax1 and nonfunctional mutant Tax1, respectively. Upon metal ion-mediated induction of Tax1, IL-21R expression as well as IL-2Rα (14Cross S.L. Feinberg M.B. Wolf J.B. Holbrook N.J. Wong-Staal F. Leonard W.J. Cell. 1987; 49: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) was significantly induced 72 h post-stimulation in JPX-9 cells, whereas such induction was not seen in heavy metal-treated JPX/M cells (Fig. 2). To gain insights into molecular mechanisms of Tax1-induced IL-21 gene expression, the effects of Tax1 on an isolated IL-21 promoter were examined by means of reporter assays. Because the IL-21 transcriptional start site was not established yet, we determined the site (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S2). Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with the Tax1 expression plasmid (pMT-2Tax) along with a reporter plasmid containing the IL-21 wild type regulatory sequences (pIL-21(−723)Luc) or its 5′ end truncated mutants. Expression of Tax1 elevated the promoter activity of the IL-21 gene in this assay (Fig. 3B). Reporter assays with a series of 5′ end truncated promoters showed two-step decreases in Tax1-dependent activation of the IL-21 promoter (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that at least two regions, −492 to −329 (upstream) and −131 to −44 (downstream), in the IL-21 promoter may mediate activation of the promoter in response to Tax1. A computer search indicated that the upstream and downstream regions carry DNA sequence candidates of an NF-κB-binding site and an AP-1-binding site, respectively. To define the implications of these possible sites in Tax1-mediated activation, we generated IL-21 promoter derivatives with substitutional mutations in each site or both sites (Fig. 3C). The introduction of mutation in each site reproducibly reduced IL-21 promoter activity by ∼25%, although the values were not statistically significant. Simultaneous introduction of mutation in the two sites totally abolished the responsiveness to Tax1 (Fig. 3D). The mutational analyses suggest that Tax1 activates the IL-21 promoter, at least partly, through the upstream (IL-21 NF-κB) and downstream (IL-21 AP-1) elements in the promoter. Cellular factors that bind to Tax1-responsive elements were investigated by means of ChIP and gel mobility shift assays. Chromatin complexes cross-linked with nuclear factors were prepared from PBLs infected with Ad-Tax1 or Ad-Con and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against NF-κB and AP-1. Anti-p52/anti-RelB antibody mixture or anti-JunD antibody alone precipitated chromatin DNA fragments encompassing the IL-21 NF-κB and IL-21 AP-1 elements in a Tax1-dependent manner, whereas neither anti-p50/anti-c-Rel antibody combination, anti-Fra2 antibody, nor anti-p21 antibody gave appreciable PCR bands with the same primer combination (Fig. 4, A and C). No PCR band was amplified from anti-p52/anti-RelB or anti-JunD antibody-mediated immunoprecipitates with PCR primers for the β-actin gene promoter (Fig. 4, A and C). During ChIP experiments, we noted that infection with Ad-Con without the Tax1 gene induced a slight increase in binding of NF-κB or AP-1 (Fig. 4, A–D). Our results suggest that p52/RelB and JunD function as mediators in"
https://openalex.org/W2009452822,"The gene of Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte-associated Antigen 4 (CTLA4), a negative regulator of T lymphocytes, contains a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position +6230A->G (ct60A->G), which has been found associated with several autoimmune diseases and appears to reduce T-cell inhibitory activity. In Ghana, West Africa, we compared the frequencies of CTLA4 +6230 A/G and 6 haplotype-tagging SNPs in 2010 smear-positive, HIV-negative patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and 2346 controls matched for age, gender and ethnicity. We found no difference in allele frequencies between cases and controls. However, +6230A and a distinct CTLA4 haplotype and a diplotype comprising the +6230A allele were significantly less frequent among cases with large opacities in chest radiographs compared to those with small ones (Pcorrected [cor] = 0.002, Pcor = 0.00045, P = 0.0005, respectively). This finding suggests that an increased T-cell activity associated with the CTLA4 +6230G allele contributes to pathology rather than to protection in pulmonary TB."

Chromatin condensation, an essential component of transcriptional repression, is controlled by various enzymes modifying histones or DNA and by proteins binding to modified histones.

HP1 proteins are well conserved (from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to mammals), and three isoforms (HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ) have been characterized in higher eukaryotes.

Indeed, in addition to its role in chromatin compaction, there is evidence to support the idea that mammalian HP1α plays a major role in chromosomal segregation during mitosis (6Sugimoto K. Tasaka H.

It has also been shown, in fission yeast and in Drosophila, that HP1 couples the RNA interference machinery to chromatin condensation (8Brower-Toland B. Findley S.D. Jiang L. Liu L. Yin H. Dus M.

Thus, HP1α participates in various aspects of chromatin organization and nuclear functions by interacting with a wide range of proteins and nucleic acids in specific nuclear territories.Here, we characterized novel HP1α-interacting proteins both in the nucleoplasm and in chromatin. Among identified partners, we found RNA-binding proteins and, in particular, hnRNP U/SAF-A, an RNA- and DNA-binding protein (11Fackelmayer F.O. Richter A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). hnRNP U is a protein of the nuclear matrix that is tightly associated with chromatin and also found in soluble hnRNP particles. In addition, this protein plays a major role in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation (12Fackelmayer F.O. Dahm K. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A. Eur. J.

We show here that hnRNP U is a bona fide HP1α-interacting protein and that depletion of hnRNP U affects HP1α nuclear localization and reduces its transcriptional repression. Thus, our data provide a functional link between hnRNP U and HP1α.DISCUSSIONTo explore HP1α functions, we have characterized new proteins associated with nuclear soluble and chromatin-associated HP1α. In both complexes, we detected transcriptional repressors, chromatin-remodeling factors, DNA repair proteins, mitotic spindle-associated proteins, and RNA-binding proteins. Among the RNA-binding proteins, we focused our attention on hnRNP U, as this protein participates in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization (12Fackelmayer F.O. Dahm K. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We have shown here that hnRNP U co-purifies with HP1α in both nucleoplasmic and chromatin-associated complexes. Interestingly, another member of the family, HP1γ, was also reported to be associated with hnRNP U and matrin 3 (21Malyavantham K.S. Bhattacharya S. Barbeitos M. Mukherjee L. Xu J. Fackelmayer F.O. Berezney R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 105: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By co-immunoprecipitation, two-color immunofluorescence, and GST pulldown, we confirmed that the two proteins interact in vitro and in live cells. The interaction is sensitive to RNase treatment. Moreover, the hnRNP U region of interaction with HP1α is the C-terminal portion, which includes the RNA-binding domain. It is thus likely that the interaction is not direct but rather mediated by some uncharacterized RNA.We next addressed the functional interaction between HP1α and hnRNP U and showed that down-regulating hnRNP U affected transcriptional repression by HP1α in a reporter assay. This result is in good concordance with the observation that various transcriptional repressors (Suv39h1, HP1β, HP1γ, and TIF1β) are found in the hnRNP U-containing, high molecular weight complex detected in glycerol gradients. Moreover, a repressive function was previously shown for hnRNP U in X chromosome silencing and in transcriptional repression (16Kim M.K. Nikodem V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6833-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Fackelmayer F.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1720-1723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).We next explored the mechanism through which hnRNP U affects HP1α function. hnRNP U is known to be located at the nuclear matrix and binds to scaffold-associated region DNA. The nuclear matrix plays a major role in the structural organization of chromatin, in the integrity of the nucleus, and in transcriptional regulation via the scaffold/matrix attachment regions. Nuclear lamina and heterochromatin are attached to the inner nuclear membrane at the nuclear envelope, and HP1α is tightly associated with the inner nuclear membrane protein lamin B receptor at the nuclear envelope (23Kourmouli N. Theodoropoulos P.A. Dialynas G. Bakou A. Politou A.S. Cowell I.G. Singh P.B. Georgatos S.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6558-6568Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We thus tested the hypothesis that hnRNP U influences HP1α proper subcellular localization. We observed by immunofluorescence and biochemical cell fractionation experiments that down-regulating hnRNP U using specific siRNAs indeed perturbed HP1α localization.HP1α is a small protein (<40 kDa) that could, in theory, diffuse passively through the nuclear pore and that requires nuclear retention signals. We believe that hnRNP U provides such a signal. Moreover, the localization of HP1α at the nuclear periphery seems to be highly dependent on hnRNP U: in hnRNP U-low cells, HP1α is more severely depleted at the nuclear periphery than in the inner nucleus (Fig. 5). We therefore conclude that hnRNP U is necessary to anchor HP1α to peripheral chromatin territories.Previously published data obtained by cell treatment with RNase support the hypothesis that an RNA component plays a major role in targeting HP1α to chromatin in mammalian cells (24Maison C. Bailly D. Peters A.H. Quivy J.P. Roche D. Taddei A. Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Almouzni G. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Our finding that an RNA-binding protein is associated with HP1α, in an RNA-dependent manner, reinforces this idea and raises the possibility that hnRNP U provides an additional molecular link between HP1 and RNA. In this model, it would be partly through hnRNP U, and maybe other RNA-binding proteins, that RNA tethers HP1α to chromatin. Taken together, our data clearly show that hnRNP U and HP1α interact in human cells and that hnRNP U is required for HP1α repressive activity and subcellular localization, shedding new light on the mode of action of HP1 and on the function of hnRNP U. Chromatin condensation, an essential component of transcriptional repression, is controlled by various enzymes modifying histones or DNA and by proteins binding to modified histones.

Moreover, a repressive function was previously shown for hnRNP U in X chromosome silencing and in transcriptional repression (16Kim M.K. Nikodem V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6833-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Fackelmayer F.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1720-1723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).We next explored the mechanism through which hnRNP U affects HP1α function. hnRNP U is known to be located at the nuclear matrix and binds to scaffold-associated region DNA. The nuclear matrix plays a major role in the structural organization of chromatin, in the integrity of the nucleus, and in transcriptional regulation via the scaffold/matrix attachment regions. Nuclear lamina and heterochromatin are attached to the inner nuclear membrane at the nuclear envelope, and HP1α is tightly associated with the inner nuclear membrane protein lamin B receptor at the nuclear envelope (23Kourmouli N. Theodoropoulos P.A. Dialynas G. Bakou A. Politou A.S. Cowell I.G. Singh P.B. Georgatos S.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6558-6568Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We thus tested the hypothesis that hnRNP U influences HP1α proper subcellular localization. We observed by immunofluorescence and biochemical cell fractionation experiments that down-regulating hnRNP U using specific siRNAs indeed perturbed HP1α localization.HP1α is a small protein (<40 kDa) that could, in theory, diffuse passively through the nuclear pore and that requires nuclear retention signals. We believe that hnRNP U provides such a signal. Moreover, the localization of HP1α at the nuclear periphery seems to be highly dependent on hnRNP U: in hnRNP U-low cells, HP1α is more severely depleted at the nuclear periphery than in the inner nucleus (Fig. 5). We therefore conclude that hnRNP U is necessary to anchor HP1α to peripheral chromatin territories.Previously published data obtained by cell treatment with RNase support the hypothesis that an RNA component plays a major role in targeting HP1α to chromatin in mammalian cells (24Maison C. Bailly D. Peters A.H. Quivy J.P. Roche D. Taddei A. Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Almouzni G. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Our finding that an RNA-binding protein is associated with HP1α, in an RNA-dependent manner, reinforces this idea and raises the possibility that hnRNP U provides an additional molecular link between HP1 and RNA. In this model, it would be partly through hnRNP U, and maybe other RNA-binding proteins, that RNA tethers HP1α to chromatin. Taken together, our data clearly show that hnRNP U and HP1α interact in human cells and that hnRNP U is required for HP1α repressive activity and subcellular localization, shedding new light on the mode of action of HP1 and on the function of hnRNP U. To explore HP1α functions, we have characterized new proteins associated with nuclear soluble and chromatin-associated HP1α. In both complexes, we detected transcriptional repressors, chromatin-remodeling factors, DNA repair proteins, mitotic spindle-associated proteins, and RNA-binding proteins. Among the RNA-binding proteins, we focused our attention on hnRNP U, as this protein participates in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization (12Fackelmayer F.O. Dahm K. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We have shown here that hnRNP U co-purifies with HP1α in both nucleoplasmic and chromatin-associated complexes. Interestingly, another member of the family, HP1γ, was also reported to be associated with hnRNP U and matrin 3 (21Malyavantham K.S. Bhattacharya S. Barbeitos M. Mukherjee L. Xu J. Fackelmayer F.O. Berezney R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 105: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By co-immunoprecipitation, two-color immunofluorescence, and GST pulldown, we confirmed that the two proteins interact in vitro and in live cells. The interaction is sensitive to RNase treatment. Moreover, the hnRNP U region of interaction with HP1α is the C-terminal portion, which includes the RNA-binding domain. It is thus likely that the interaction is not direct but rather mediated by some uncharacterized RNA. We next addressed the functional interaction between HP1α and hnRNP U and showed that down-regulating hnRNP U affected transcriptional repression by HP1α in a reporter assay.

https://openalex.org/W1992101240,"Proteins contributing to a complex disease are often members of the same functional pathways. Elucidation of such pathways may provide increased knowledge about functional mechanisms underlying disease. By combining genetic interactions in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) with protein interaction data we have previously identified sets of genes, likely to represent distinct cellular pathways involved in T1D risk. Here we evaluate the candidate genes involved in these putative interaction networks not only at the single gene level, but also in the context of the networks of which they form an integral part. mRNA expression levels for each gene were evaluated and profiling was performed by measuring and comparing constitutive expression in human islets versus cytokine-stimulated expression levels, and for lymphocytes by comparing expression levels among controls and T1D individuals. We identified differential regulation of several genes. In one of the networks four out of nine genes showed significant down regulation in human pancreatic islets after cytokine exposure supporting our prediction that the interaction network as a whole is a risk factor. In addition, we measured the enrichment of T1D associated SNPs in each of the four interaction networks to evaluate evidence of significant association at network level. This method provided additional support, in an independent data set, that two of the interaction networks could be involved in T1D and highlights the following processes as risk factors: oxidative stress, regulation of transcription and apoptosis. To understand biological systems, integration of genetic and functional information is necessary, and the current study has used this approach to improve understanding of T1D and the underlying biological mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2064605698,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists, such as epibatidine and its molecular derivatives, are potential therapeutic agents for a variety of neurological disorders. In order to identify determinants for subtype-selective agonist binding, it is important to determine whether an agonist binds in a common orientation in different nAChR subtypes. To compare the mode of binding of epibatidine in a muscle and a neuronal nAChR, we photolabeled Torpedo α2βγδ and expressed human α4β2 nAChRs with [3H]epibatidine and identified by Edman degradation the photolabeled amino acids. Irradiation at 254 nm resulted in photolabeling of αTyr198 in agonist binding site Segment C of the principal (+) face in both α subunits and of γLeu109 and γTyr117 in Segment E of the complementary (−) face, with no labeling detected in the δ subunit. For affinity-purified α4β2 nAChRs, [3H]epibatidine photolabeled α4Tyr195 (equivalent to Torpedo αTyr190) in Segment C as well as β2Val111 and β2Ser113 in Segment E (equivalent to Torpedo γLeu109 and γTyr111, respectively). Consideration of the location of the photolabeled amino acids in homology models of the nAChRs based upon the acetylcholine-binding protein structure and the results of ligand docking simulations suggests that epibatidine binds in a single preferred orientation within the α-γ transmitter binding site, whereas it binds in two distinct orientations in the α4β2 nAChR.

Pereira E.F. Alkondon M. Rogers S.W. Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 73-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). nAChRs from vertebrate skeletal muscle and the electric organs of Torpedo rays are heteropentamers of homologous subunits with a stoichiometry of 2α:β:γ(ϵ):δ that are arranged pseudosymmetrically around central cation-selective ion channels (1Albuquerque E.X. Pereira E.F. Alkondon M. Rogers S.W. Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 73-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar, 2Wells G.B. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 5479-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There are 12 mammalian neuronal nAChR subunit genes: nine neuronal α subunits (α2–α10) and three neuronal β subunits (β2–β4). The α4β2 nAChR is the most abundant and widely distributed nAChR subtype expressed in the brain and is a major target for potential therapeutic agents for neurological diseases and conditions, including nicotine dependence and Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (3Jensen A.A.

Although the ratio of α4 to β2 subunit in vivo is uncertain, expressed receptors containing either three α4 or three β2 subunits have distinct pharmacological properties (5Nelson M. E Kuryatov A.

The agonist binding sites (ABS) of nAChRs are located within the amino-terminal extracellular domain at the interface of adjacent subunits (α-γ and α-δ in the Torpedo nAChR), and different nAChR subunit combinations form ABS with distinct physical and pharmacological properties (3Jensen A.A. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4705-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 7Corringer P.J. Le Novère N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Affinity labeling studies with Torpedo nAChR and site-directed mutational analyses of muscle and neuronal nAChRs identified key amino acids delineating the ABS from three noncontiguous stretches of the α subunit (Segments A-C, the principal component (+ face)) and three noncontiguous regions of the non-α subunit (Segments D–F, the complementary component (− face)) (8Changeux J.-P.

Rev. 2008; 108: 1642-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the ABS in the absence and presence of nAChR agonists or competitive antagonists has been determined for snail acetylcholine-binding proteins (AChBPs) that are soluble homopentamers homologous to the extracellular (amino-terminal) domain of a nAChR (10Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In the AChBP, four aromatic amino acids from Segments A–C that are conserved within α subunits, along with a conserved Trp in Segment D, form a core aromatic “pocket” with a dimension optimal for accommodation of a trimethylammonium group. The other amino acids in the non-α subunits closest to the aromatic pocket, which are generally not conserved among γ, δ, or neuronal β subunits, are on three antiparallel β strands. The AChBP structure was used to refine the structure of the Torpedo nAChR in the absence of agonist to 4 Å resolution (13Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). In this structure, there is a reorientation of Segments A–C, resulting in the absence of a well defined core aromatic binding pocket. Analysis of agonist interactions with mutant nAChRs containing fluorine-substituted core aromatic residues provides evidence that cation-π interactions, particularly with αTrp149 in Segment B, are important determinants of agonist binding affinity (14Cashin A.L. Torrice M.M. McMenimen K.A. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and for the higher affinity binding of nicotine to α4β2 nAChRs compared with α2βγδ nAChRs (15Xiu X. Puskar N.L. Shanata J.A. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Nature. 2009; 458: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses and molecular docking calculations have also provided evidence that two molecules of very similar structure may actually bind to a single receptor in very different orientations, as seen for two high affinity antagonists, d-tubocurarine and its quaternary ammonium analog metocurine, binding to the AChBP and to the muscle nAChR (16Gao F.

Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13447-13456Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Epibatidine binds with very high affinity (∼10 pm) to heteromeric neuronal nAChRs (e.g. α4β2) and with nanomolar affinity to α7 and muscle-type/Torpedo nAChRs (3Jensen A.A. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4705-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Utilizing a photoreactive analogue of epibatidine (azidoepibatidine; Fig. 1) and mass spectrometry, Tomizawa et al. (21Tomizawa M. Maltby D. Medzihradszky K.F. Zhang N. Durkin K.A. Presley J. Talley T.T. Taylor P. Burlingame A.L. Casida J.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 8798-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) identified photolabeled amino acids in the Aplysia AChBP (Tyr195 in Segment C and Met116 in Segment E), establishing an orientation for bound azidoepibatidine consistent with the orientation of epibatidine in an AChBP crystal structure (12Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In this report, we use [3H]epibatidine as a photoaffinity reagent to identify the amino acids photolabeled in an expressed α4β2 nAChR and in the Torpedo α2βγδ nAChR. Comparisons of the labeled amino acids seen in the Torpedo nAChR α-γ binding site and in the α4β2 nAChR, in conjunction with the results of docking calculations for epibatidine binding to homology models of the α2βγδ and α4β2 nAChRs, suggests that epibatidine binds in a single orientation in the α-γ site but in two orientations in the α4β2 ABS. [3H]Epibatidine (45 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and stored in 95% ethanol at 4 °C. Carbamylcholine chloride, bromoacetylcholine bromide, and diisopropylfluorophosphate were from Sigma. Epibatidine and d- tubocurarine (dTC) were from Tocris (Ellisville, MO), and Staphylococcus aureus endoproteinase Glu-C (V8 protease) was from Worthington. Endoproteinase Lys-C (EndoLys-C) and protease inhibitor mixture set III were from Calbiochem. Sodium cholate and CHAPS were from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Affi-Gel 10 was from Bio-Rad. Synthetic lipids (dioleoyl phosphatidic acid and dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine) as well as cholesterol, asolectin, and total lipid extract from porcine brain were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Torpedo californica nAChR-rich membranes for radioligand binding studies and for affinity purification were isolated from frozen electric organs (Aquatic Research Consultants, San Pedro, CA), as described previously (22Pedersen S.E. Dreyer E.B. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13735-13743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes at 1 mg/ml protein were solubilized in 1% sodium cholate in vesicle dialysis buffer (VDB; 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5) and treated with 0.1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate after insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation (91,000 × g for 1 h). The nAChR was affinity-purified on a bromoacetylcholine bromide-derivatized Affi-Gel 10 column and then reconstituted into lipid vesicles composed of dioleoyl phosphatidic acid/dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol (at a molar ratio of 3:1:1), as described (23Fong T.M. McNamee M.G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 830-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 24Hamouda A.K. Sanghvi M. Sauls D. Machu T.K. Blanton M.P. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4327-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The lipid/nAChR ratio was adjusted to molar ratio of 400:1. Based upon SDS-PAGE, after purification, the nAChR comprised more than 90% of the protein in the preparation. Both the nAChR-rich membranes and purified nAChRs were stored at −80 °C. HEK-293 cells stably transfected with human α4β2 nAChRs (HEK-hα4β2) were kindly provided by Dr. Joseph H. Steinbach (Department of Anesthesiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) (25Zhang J. Steinbach J.H. Brain Res. 2003; 959: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HEK-hα4β2 cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2 in 140-mm dishes and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 450 μg/ml Geneticin (G418; A.G. Scientific, San Diego, CA) as a selection agent (26Hamouda A.K. Sanghvi M. Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. Blanton M.P. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13837-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For membrane preparation, HEK-hα4β2 cells were homogenized in VDB in the presence of 0.2 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem). Membrane fractions were isolated by centrifugation (39,000 × g for 1 h) and then resuspended in VDB containing 0.2 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture III and stored at −80 °C. For affinity purification, HEK-hα4β2 cell membranes (typically 2 g of protein from ∼600 dishes) at 1 mg/ml protein in VDB containing 0.2 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture III were solubilized with 1% CHAPS, centrifuged (91,500 × g for 1 h) to pellet insoluble material, and then dialyzed for 5 h against 1% cholate. The hα4β2 nAChRs were affinity-purified on a bromoacetylcholine bromide-derivatized Affi-Gel 10 column and reconstituted into lipid vesicles composed of asolectin/total lipid extract from porcine brain, as described previously (26Hamouda A.K. Sanghvi M. Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. Blanton M.P. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13837-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The purity of hα4β2 nAChRs was >50%, as estimated by densitometric quantification of Coomassie Blue-stained gels. The effect of epibatidine and dTC on the binding of [3H]epibatidine to Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes was determined using a centrifugation assay with duplicate samples. Membranes at 0.1 mg/ml protein (16 nm ACh binding sites) in Torpedo physiological saline (250 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either 0.5 nm [3H]epibatidine and increasing concentrations of epibatidine (final concentrations 0.3 nm to 3 μm) or 2 nm [3H]epibatidine in the absence and presence of 6 μm proadifen and increasing concentrations of dTC (final concentrations 1 nm to 1 mm). Bound and free [3H]epibatidine were separated by centrifugation (39,000 × g for 1 h) and then quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mm carbamylcholine. The concentration-dependent inhibition of [3H]epibatidine binding by epibatidine and dTC were fit according to a single-site model as follows,fx=NS+T/1+x/IC50(Eq. 1) and to a two-site model,fx=NS+0.5T/1+x/IC501+0.5T/1+x/IC502(Eq. 2) where f(x) is the [3H]epibatidine binding in the presence of competitor concentration x, T is the total specific binding, NS is the nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 1 mm carbamylcholine, and IC50 is the concentration of competitor that inhibits 50% of the total specific binding. Sigmaplot version 11 (Systat Software) was used for non-linear least squares fit of the data, and the S.E. values of the parameter fits are indicated. For analytical labelings, ∼50-μg samples of affinity-purified Torpedo nAChRs in 1 ml of VDB were incubated with 0.13 μm [3H]epibatidine in the absence or presence of epibatidine (40 μm) or increasing concentrations of dTC (final concentrations 0.2–20 μm). After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the samples in glass test tubes were irradiated for 30 min with a 254-nm UV lamp (Spectroline EN-280L). The labeled membranes were then pelleted by centrifugation (39,000 × g for 1 h), resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer (12.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 8% sucrose, 1% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8), and resolved on 1-mm-thick, 8% polyacrylamide, 0.33% bisacrylamide gels (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). After staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 and destaining to visualize bands, gels were impregnated with fluor (Amplify; GE Biosciences) for 30 min, dried, and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat LS film at −80 °C (1–4-week exposure). For some 8% gels, following staining and destaining, gels were soaked in distilled water overnight, and bands corresponding to the α and γ subunits were excised, soaked in overlay buffer (5% sucrose, 125 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% SDS, pH 6.8) for 30 min, transferred to the wells of a 15% acrylamide mapping gel, and digested in gel with 10 μg of V8 protease (28Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, mapping gels were processed for fluorography (3–6-week exposure) as described above. For both 8 and 15% mapping gels, to quantify the amount of 3H cpm incorporated into nAChR subunits or subunit proteolytic fragments, bands were excised from the gel, transferred to 5-ml scintillation vials, and soaked in 0.5 ml of 0.1% SDS for 4 days with occasional mixing. Then 3 ml of liquid scintillation mixture was added, and samples were counted for 5 min. For labeling on a preparative scale, affinity-purified Torpedo nAChRs (∼3 mg of protein in 8 ml) were labeled with 550 nm [3H]epibatidine, and the α and γ subunits were isolated by SDS-PAGE and then subjected to in-gel digestion with V8 protease. Based on fluorographs of mapping gels from analytical scale labeling experiments, labeled proteolytic fragments from each subunit (αV8-20 and γV8-14) were excised, and the polypeptides were retrieved by passive diffusion into 25 ml of elution buffer (0.1 m NH4HCO3, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.8) and concentrated in Centriprep-10 and Centricon-3 concentrators (10/3 kDa cut-off; Amicon) to a final volume of ∼150 μl. For digestion with EndoLys-C, αV8-20-labeled peptides were acetone-precipitated (75% acetone at −20 °C overnight) to remove SDS, resuspended in 150 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.6, and then digested with three units of EndoLys-C for 7 days. For analytical labelings, ∼50-μg samples of affinity-purified α4β2 nAChRs in 1 ml of VDB were photolabeled with 880 nm [3H]epibatidine in the absence or presence of epibatidine (40 μm). For labeling on a preparative scale, α4β2 nAChRs (1.2 mg of protein in 6 ml) were photolabeled with 800 nm [3H]epibatidine. Using the same protocols described above for Torpedo nAChR, samples from analytical labelings were processed to determine 3H incorporation into the α4 and β2 nAChR subunits (as well as a 36-kDa proteolytic fragment), and the α4 and β2 nAChR subunits and the 36-kDa proteolytic fragments from preparative scale labeling were retrieved, acetone-precipitated, and resuspended in 150 μl of 0.1 m NH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.8, for digestion with V8 protease (100 μg of protease for 4 days). Prior to sequence analysis, all of the [3H]epibatidine-labeled peptides were purified using reversed-phase HPLC (rpHPLC) on a Shimadzu LC-10A binary HPLC system, using a Brownlee Aquapore C4 column (100 × 2.1 mm). Solvent A was composed of 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and Solvent B contained 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile, 40% 2-propanol. A non-linear elution gradient at 0.2 ml/min was employed (25–100% Solvent B in 100 min, shown as dotted line in the figures), and fractions were collected every 2.5 min (40 fractions/run). The elution of peptides was monitored by the absorbance at 210 nm, and the amount of 3H associated with each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting of 5% aliquots. For sequence analysis, rpHPLC fractions containing peaks of 3H were pooled, diluted 3-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and loaded onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters using Prosorb® sample preparation cartridges (catalog number 401959; Applied Biosystems). The filters were then treated with Biobrene, as recommended by the manufacturer. Sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems PROCISETM 492 protein sequencer configured to utilize one-sixth of each cycle of Edman degradation for amino acid quantification and to collect the other five-sixths for 3H counting. To determine the amount of sequenced peptide, the pmol of each amino acid in a detected sequence was quantified by peak height and fit to the equation f(x) = I0Rx, where I0 represents the initial amount of the peptide sequenced (in pmol), R is the repetitive yield, and f(x) is the pmol detected in cycle x. Ser, His, Trp, and Cys were not included in the fits due to known problems with their accurate detection/quantification. The fit was calculated in SigmaPlot 11 using a non-linear least squares method, and figures containing 3H release profiles include this fit as a dotted line. Some sequencing samples were treated with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) prior to a cycle known to contain a proline (29Middleton R.E. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6987-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). OPA reacts with all amino-terminal amino acids (but not with the imino acid proline) and blocks further Edman degradation (30Brauer A.W. Oman C.L. Margolies M.N. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, release of 3H in a cycle after an OPA treatment establishes that the 3H release originates from a peptide with a proline in the OPA-treated cycle. Quantification of 3H incorporated into a specific residue (cpm/pmol) was calculated by (cpmx − cpm(x − 1))/5I0Rx. Models of the extracellular domain of the human (α4)2(β2)3 and Torpedo nAChR were constructed from the x-ray structure of the epibatidine-bound form of the Aplysia AChBP (12Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 2BYQ) using the Discovery Studio (Accelrys, Inc.) software package. Epibatidine (volume 156 Å3) was docked into the ABS of the Aplysia AChBP crystal structure and in the models of the Torpedo α-γ and human α4-β2 ABS using CDOCKER (31Wu G. Robertson D.H. Brooks 3rd, C.L. Vieth M. J. Comput. Chem. 2003; 24: 1549-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 32Erickson J.A. Jalaie M. Robertson D.H. Lewis R.A. Vieth M. J. Med.

Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13767) Google Scholar) molecular dynamics simulated annealing program that treats the ligand as fully flexible while maintaining a rigid receptor. In each docking experiment, 50 replicas of epibatidine (protonated form) were seeded in random orientations within the ABS defined by a binding site sphere of 12 Å radius. For each starting seed, CDOCKER was used to generate 10 ligand conformations using high temperature molecular dynamics, and then the 10 lowest energy orientations were identified using random rigid body rotations, followed by simulated annealing and a full potential final minimization step. For visualization, we show in Fig. 7 the Connolly surface representations, defined by a 1.8-Å diameter probe, of the ensemble of the 20 docking solutions with the lowest CDOCKER interaction energies. In equilibrium binding studies with Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes, epibatidine fully inhibited the binding of 0.5 nm [3H]epibatidine, with the data well fit by a single-site model with an IC50 of 11 ± 2 nm (Fig. 2A). We used the displacement of [3H]epibatidine binding by dTC to explore the agonist binding site selectivity of epibatidine. dTC binds with higher affinity (Kd = 35 nm) at the Torpedo α-γ agonist binding site than the α-δ site (Kd = 8 μm) (34Neubig R.R. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5464-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The dTC displacement data (Fig. 2B, closed circles) were well fit by a model of two sites, equally occupied by [3H]epibatidine, with IC50 values of 42 ± 7 nm and 1.8 ± 0.2 μm, consistent with dTC displacement of [3H]epibatidine bound to the α-γ and α-δ sites, respectively. The addition of proadifen, a desensitizing noncompetitive antagonist, enhanced [3H]epibatidine binding (Fig. 2B, open circles) with little effect on the relative occupancy by epibatidine of the α-γ and α-δ sites. We used SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography (Fig. 3A) and scintillation counting of excised gel bands (Fig. 3B) to provide an initial characterization of the subunit and pharmacological specificity of 3H incorporation when affinity-purified Torpedo nAChRs were photolabeled on an analytical scale (∼50-μg samples). As seen in the fluorograph, [3H]epibatidine was incorporated primarily in the nAChR α and γ subunits (−Epi lane). Photolabeling was eliminated by the addition of an excess (40 μm) of nonradioactive epibatidine (+Epi lane) and inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by dTC. Based upon scintillation counting, the concentration dependence of dTC inhibition of 3H photoincorporation in the γ subunit (Fig. 3B, open circles) was well fit by a single-site model with an IC50 value of 0.45 ± 0.07 μm, whereas inhibition of labeling in the α subunit (Fig. 3B, solid circles) was better fit by a two-site model (IC50 values of 35 ± 12 nm and 2 ± 0.4 μm) than a one-site model (IC50 = 0.6 ± 0.2 μm), where there were systematic deviations of the data from the fit at concentrations below 0.3 μm. Pharmacologically specific (epibatidine-inhibitable) 3H photoincorporation within the δ subunit, if it occurred, was at <10% the level in the γ subunit. Although these labeling studies were conducted with affinity-purified nAChRs, an [3H]epibatidine photolabeling of native Torpedo nAChR-rich membranes under similar conditions also resulted in labeling of α and γ subunits, with little if any labeling in the δ subunit (data not shown). To identify amino acids photolabeled by [3H]epibatidine within the α and γ subunits, the incorporation in each subunit was first mapped by in-gel digestion with V8 protease, which for the α subunit produces fragments of ∼20 kDa (αV8-20, beginning at αSer173 and containing ACh binding site Segment C), ∼18 kDa (αV8-18, beginning at αThr52 and containing binding site Segments A and B), and ∼10 kDa (αV8-10, beginning at αAsn338 and containing the M4 membrane-spanning helix (35White B.H. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8741-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)). The corresponding fluorograph of a mapping gel (Fig. 4) established that all detectable (and specific) labeling in the α subunit was contained within a Coomassie-stained band of ∼20 kDa (αV8-20), whereas, based upon liquid scintillation counting, the labeling in αV8-18 was less than 5% that of αV8-20 (supplementary Fig. S1). For the γ subunit, all 3H incorporation was contained within an ∼14 kDa band (γV8-14). To identify the residues photolabeled by [3H]epibatidine, αV8-20 and γV8-14 were isolated from affinity-purified Torpedo nAChRs photolabeled on a preparative scale (3.5 mg). Labeled αV8-20 was digested with EndoLys-C, which cleaves αV8-20 after αLys185 (36Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32940-32950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). When the digest was fractionated by rpHPLC, ∼90% of the recovered 3H eluted in a single peak at ∼87% solvent B (supplemental Fig. S1). Sequence analysis of the peak fractions (Fig. 5A) revealed a primary sequence beginning at αHis186 (23 pmol) and a single peak of 3H release in cycle 13, corresponding to labeling of αTyr198 (28 cpm/pmol), one of two tyrosines in Segment C contributing to the core aromatic binding pocket for ACh. During sequencing, the sample was treated after cycle 8 (see the arrow in Fig. 5A) with OPA, which reacts with primary, but not secondary, amines and"
https://openalex.org/W1963613544,"Thalidomide possesses both anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties. This study investigates its potential application in islet transplantation with a xenogenic transplantation model. Transplantation was performed using C57Bl/6 mice and NMRI nu/nu mice as recipients of porcine islets. Moreover, islet graft vasculature and inflammation were investigated to identify the mechanisms of thalidomide action. In the immunocompetent environment of C57Bl/6 mice, a fast graft rejection was observed. The group treated with thalidomide 200 mg/kg BW per day achieved and maintained euglycemia in the complete observation period for 42 days. The treated mice had more functional islet graft mass with less leukocyte infiltration. The pro-inflammatory TNF-alpha and VEGF content in islet grafted kidneys was significantly lowered by the treatment. By comparison, thalidomide was not effective in improving graft survival in immunocompromised nude mice. It strongly inhibited the VEGF and TNF-alpha-induced endothelial proliferation of isolated pig islets in a dose dependent manner. The magnitude of thalidomide's inhibitory effect was nearly identical to the effect of VEGF- receptor 2 inhibitor SU416 and anti-TNF-receptor 1 neutralizing antibody, and was reversed by sphingosine-1-phosphate. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory effect of thalidomide improved islet graft survival and function in a transplantation model with a maximum immune barrier."
https://openalex.org/W1987410423,"Fibulin 5 is a 52-kDa calcium-binding epidermal growth factor (cbEGF)-rich extracellular matrix protein that is essential for the formation of elastic tissues. Missense mutations in fibulin 5 cause the elastin disorder cutis laxa and have been associated with age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness. We investigated the structure, hydrodynamics, and oligomerization of fibulin 5 using small angle x-ray scattering, EM, light scattering, circular dichroism, and sedimentation. Compact structures for the monomer were determined by small angle x-ray scattering and EM, and are supported by close agreement between the theoretical sedimentation of the structures and the experimental sedimentation of the monomer in solution. EM showed that monomers associate around a central cavity to form a dimer. Light scattering and equilibrium sedimentation demonstrated that the equilibrium between the monomer and the dimer is dependent upon NaCl and Ca2+ concentrations and that the dimer is dominant under physiological conditions. The dimerization of fragments containing just the cbEGF domains suggests that intermolecular interactions between cbEGFs cause dimerization of fibulin 5. It is possible that fibulin 5 functions as a dimer during elastinogenesis or that dimerization may provide a method for limiting interactions with binding partners such as tropoelastin."

During analysis of the underlying mechanism, we serendipitously found that hairpin-capped linear DNA was stably maintained as numerous extrachromosomal tiny episomes for more than a few months in a human cancer cell line. Generation of such episomes depended on the presence of the replication initiation region in the original plasmid. Despite extrachromosomal maintenance, episomal gene expression was epigenetically suppressed. The Southern blot analysis of the DNA of cloned cells revealed that the region around the hairpin end was diversified between the clones. Furthermore, the bisulfite-modified PCR and the sequencing analyses revealed that the palindrome sequence that derived from the original hairpin end or its end-resected structure were well preserved during clonal long term growth. From these data, we propose a model that explains the formation and maintenance of these episomes, in which replication of the hairpin-capped DNA and cruciform formation and its resolution play central roles.

DMs are acentric, atelomeric chromatin bodies composed of amplified DNA of genomic origin. We previously found that a plasmid with a mammalian replication initiation region (IR) and a matrix attachment region (MAR) is efficiently amplified to high copy number in mammalian cells and that it generates DMs and/or HSRs composed of plasmid sequences (5.Shimizu N. Hashizume T. Shingaki K. Kawamoto J.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5281-5290PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Shimizu N. Miura Y. Sakamoto Y. Tsutsui K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6987-6990PubMed Google Scholar). Because IRs and MARs are scattered throughout the mammalian genome in a frequency of once per several tens of kilobase pairs and because it was proposed that circular molecules excised from the genome may mediate gene amplification in cancer cells (7.Carroll S.M. DeRose M.L. Gaudray P. Moore C.M. Needham-Vandevanter D.R. Von Hoff D.D. Wahl G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 8.Von Hoff D.D.

U.S.A. 1988; 85: 4804-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we considered the plasmid system as a novel one that efficiently reproduces gene amplification in cultured cells. Thus, we examined the mechanism by which the IR/MAR plasmid mimics gene amplification (5.Shimizu N. Hashizume T. Shingaki K. Kawamoto J.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5281-5290PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Shimizu N. Shingaki K. Kaneko-Sasaguri Y. Hashizume T. Kanda T. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 302: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We suggested that the IR/MAR plasmid undergoes multiplication to produce a large extrachromosomal circle consisting of tandem repeats of plasmid sequences. If multiplication is extensive, the circle forms DMs. If the large circle is integrated into the chromosome, it efficiently initiates a breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, which generates an HSR. Plasmid-borne genes are expressed more actively when they are amplified in DMs than in HSRs (10.Shimizu N. Hanada N. Utani K. Sekiguchi N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Indeed, most of an HSR is heterochromatic, and transcription is detected only at few discrete spots inside the HSR (11.Utani K. Shimizu N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). If an inducible promoter in the HSR is activated, the entire HSR is loosened, and active transcription is detected throughout this region (11.Utani K. Shimizu N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Such transcriptional activation, in collaboration with DNA demethylation induced by 5-azacytidine treatment, results in fragmentation of the HSR and the generation of extrachromosomal DMs (10.Shimizu N. Hanada N. Utani K. Sekiguchi N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, gene amplification generated by the IR/MAR plasmid has been used for chromosome studies (12.Shimizu N. Shingaki K. J.

In previous experiments on IR/MAR plasmid-mediated gene amplification, we always transfected supercoiled covalently closed plasmid DNA into cells. Thus, the initial aim of this study was to examine the effect of the physical structure of the plasmid molecule at the time of transfection to further understand the gene amplification process. Thus, in addition to the supercoiled and the linear IR/MAR plasmid, we examined the effect of a hairpin cap at the end of a linear molecule, because it was suggested that inverted repeats, cruciform formation, and hairpin-capped chromosome ends have implications for gene amplification in yeast (17.Narayanan V.

ETEs are tiny dots revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a plasmid probe, and they are distinct from the far larger DMs. The appearance of ETEs depends on the presence of the IR sequence, and they are stably maintained in cells for more than 3 months. We propose a model that explains how the hairpin-capped IR/MAR plasmid is maintained extrachromosomally, and the persistence of this structure resembles a recently reported phenomenon in yeast cells (21.Coté A.G. Lewis S.M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 800-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our finding may benefit the analysis of replication initiation in the extrachromosomal context. The plasmids pSFVdhfr and pSFV-V (see Fig. 1A) were previously described (5.Shimizu N. Hashizume T. Shingaki K. Kawamoto J.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5281-5290PubMed Google Scholar). pSFVdhfr bears a 4.6-kilobase pair fragment of a replication IR from the 3′ region downstream of the DHFR gene, which contains a sequence showing MAR activity; the plasmid also has blasticidine and hygromycin resistance genes. pSFV-V is a control plasmid that lacks the DHFR IR/MAR segment. pΔBM-d2EGFP was constructed by digesting pSFV-dhfr with BamHI/MluI to remove the hygromycin expression cassette, and the remaining portion was ligated to a synthetic 62-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide that bears a multiple cloning site (MCS; 5′-BamHI*-KpnI-AscI-SalI-SwaI-AsiSI-SbfI-BamHI-MluI*-3′, where the asterisk indicates a cohesive end to the denoted enzyme) to produce pΔBM-MCS. pΔBM-d2EGFP (see Fig. 1B) was constructed by digesting pΔBM-MCS with AscI and AsiSI at unique sites in the MCS and ligating it to a PvuI/BssHII fragment derived from pCMV-d2EGFP (10.Shimizu N. Hanada N. Utani K. Sekiguchi N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) that contains the d2EGFP gene driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter and terminated by a SV40 poly(A) signal. Supercoiled plasmid DNA was isolated from bacteria with a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen) and linearized by digesting with the indicated restriction enzyme. Hairpin-capped linear plasmid DNA was prepared as illustrated in Fig. 1. For the experiment in Fig. 3B, pSFVdhfr or pSFV-V was digested by AseI/MluI, and the product was ligated with an excess molar amount of synthetic AseI hairpin DNA (see Fig. 1A). The sequence was 5′-TAA TAT GCT GCA CTG ACG TCA GTG CAG CAT AT, which generates an AseI cohesive end after fold-back. The reaction product should be a linear inverted plasmid dimer in which both ends are hairpin-capped; electrophoretic analysis revealed a predominant band of a size corresponding to the plasmid dimer (see Fig. 1C). Digestion of this preparation with MluI resulted in a linear plasmid monomer, of which one end was hairpin-capped. In other experiments, pΔBM-d2EGFP was digested with MluI, which cuts in the MCS, and the digest was ligated with an excess molar amount of synthetic MluI hairpin DNA (see Fig. 1B), whose sequence 5′-CGC GAT ATG CTG CAC TGA CGT CAG TGC AGC ATA T generates an MluI cohesive end after fold-back. The ligation product was about the same length with the original DNA, whereas the ligation without hairpin DNA produced much larger DNA, as anticipated (see Fig. 1D). Such a preparation was treated with phenol/chloroform, precipitated by ethanol, and used for the transfection. Human COLO 320DM (CCL 220) neuroendocrine tumor cells were maintained as previously described (22.Shimizu N. Kanda T. Wahl G.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). There are on average ∼64 copies of the c-myc oncogene in these cells, which localize to DMs. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All transfections were performed using the Gene Porter 2 lipofection kit (Genlantis Co.). Stable transformants were selected by 5 μg/ml blasticidine (Funakoshi, Co., Tokyo, Japan) and continuously grown in this concentration of blasticidine. More than 1 month after the transfection, the polyclonal transformant was analyzed by FISH to determine the location of plasmid sequence or by genomic Southern blot hybridization. From the same polyclonal transformant, clonal cell populations were obtained by limiting dilution and further grown for ∼2 months. Metaphase chromosome spreads were prepared from these cells, and the location of plasmid sequences was determined by FISH using a digoxigenin-labeled probe prepared from the plasmid. Probe preparation and FISH procedures were as described (23.Hashizume T. Shimizu N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 101: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The slide was counterstained with propidium iodide and examined with an epifluorescence microscopy (ECLIPSE TE2000-U, Nikon) equipped with a 100× objective lens (Nikon Plan Fluor, NA 1.30 oil) and an appropriate filter set. Digital images were acquired with a Fuji FinePix S1Pro digital camera (Fuji Film Co.) and processed with Adobe Photoshop CS version 8.0.1 (Adobe Systems, Inc.). Sodium butyrate (Sigma), trichostatin A (Sigma), MS-275 (Alexis Biochemical, San Diego, CA), oxamflatin (Calbiochem Biochemicals, Darmstadt, Germany), dimethyl sulfoxide (Nakarai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), and 5-azacytidine (Sigma) were added to the cultures at the indicated concentrations. Extraction of total genomic DNA and Southern blot hybridization were as described (5.Shimizu N. Hashizume T. Shingaki K. Kawamoto J.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5281-5290PubMed Google Scholar). To amplify the palindrome sequence, we used bisulfite-modified PCR, as described by others (24.Tanaka H. Tapscott S.J. Trask B.J. Yao M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8772-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25.Rattray A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e155Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Namely, we treated the DNA with bisulfite to convert unmethylated cytosine to uracil by using the EpiTect bisulfite kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Using the bisulfite-modified DNA, PCR was performed as the following condition. The 20-μl reaction mixture contained 1× Blend Taq Buffer (Toyobo Co., Osaka, Japan), 200 μm dNTP (Toyobo), 0.25 unit of Blend Taq Plus (Toyobo), 1 μm primer, and the bisulfite-modified DNA. The PCR condition was 35 cycles or the number of cycles in Fig. 1 at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. The 20–24-mer primer sequences were designed from the plasmid sequence at the region where no CpG sequence appeared, and all of the cytosine residues in the original sequence were substituted by thymine in the primer sequence. The sequence of the primer will be provided upon request. To sequence the PCR product, it was cloned by using pGEM-T Easy Vector Systems (Promega) and Escherichia coli DH5α (TOYOBO, Co., Osaka). DNA for sequencing was directly amplified form the E. coli colony by PCR using Blend Taq Plus (TOYOBO). The product was purified by Dye Terminator Removal gel filtration cartridge (Edge BioSystems) and analyzed by the ABI PRISM dGTP BigDye terminator ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). We prepared supercoiled, linear, and hairpin-capped plasmid DNA as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and under “Experimental Procedures,” introduced them into human colorectal carcinoma COLO 320DM cells, and selected stable transformants by blasticidine for 1 month. We prepared metaphase chromosome spreads from transformants and detected plasmid sequences by FISH. As we previously reported (5.Shimizu N. Hashizume T. Shingaki K. Kawamoto J.K.

Cell Res. 2001; 268: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the supercoiled IR/MAR plasmid efficiently generated HSRs and DMs. Small (Fig. 2A) and large HSRs (Fig. 2B) or DMs (Fig. 2, C and D) could be identified not only in metaphase cells but also in interphase nuclei. We determined their frequencies as shown in Fig. 3. Supercoiled pΔBM-d2EGFP (Fig. 3A) or supercoiled pSFVdhfr (Fig. 3B) generated large HSRs in 40 or 20% of the transformants, respectively, as well as DMs at lower frequencies. As reported, such gene amplification depended on the presence of the IR/MAR sequence in the plasmid, because supercoiled pSFV-V did not generate HSRs or DMs. We also found that the linearized IR/MAR plasmid generated HSRs or DMs. The data in Fig. 3 show that the frequency for linear DNA appeared lower than that for supercoiled DNA. However, the efficiency strongly depended on the site where the plasmid was linearized. 3M. Uchida, unpublished results. We expected that the addition of a hairpin cap to the linear IR/MAR plasmid might affect the frequencies of DM or HSR formation. However, we were surprised to see that hairpin-capped DNA scarcely generated HSRs and conventional DMs, but instead the plasmid sequence appeared as many tiny FISH signals in interphase (Fig. 2G) or metaphase (Fig. 2H) cells. In our previous papers (5.Shimizu N. Hashizume T. Shingaki K. Kawamoto J.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5281-5290PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Shimizu N. Miura Y. Sakamoto Y. Tsutsui K.

Cell Res. 2001; 268: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we had detected DMs in COLO 320DM cells by FISH using DM-painting probe or c-myc cosmid probe. However, the chromatin of DMs in these cells is large enough; thus we could easily detect them by DNA staining (yellow arrows in Fig. 2H). In the figure, the tiny FISH spots (white arrowheads) that were invisible by DNA staining stuck to such DMs or apart from them. It is consistent that the extrachromosomal elements frequently stick to the DMs, which was shown for the autonomous replicating plasmid in the same COLO 320DM cells (23.Hashizume T. Shimizu N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 101: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The frequencies of the cells bearing such tiny FISH signals are shown in Fig. 3. Such tiny episomal sequences appeared in initial polyclonal transformants that were grown for 1 month after transfection (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) and cloned cells (see below) that were grown for a few months after transfection. Therefore, these episomal plasmid sequences were stably maintained. We named these extrachromosomal tiny episomes ETEs. The appearance of ETEs depended not only on the presence of the hairpin cap of the transfected DNA (Fig. 3A) but also on the presence of the IR/MAR sequence. Namely, hairpin-capped linear pSFVdhfr generated ETEs, whereas pSFV-V yielded far fewer ETEs (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, linear DNA that was hairpin-capped at one or both ends generated ETEs. This result suggests that the end without the hairpin cap may be ligated intracellularly to generate a molecule with two hairpin-capped ends. We previously showed that expression from DMs is always much higher than that from HSRs (10.Shimizu N. Hanada N. Utani K. Sekiguchi N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Now, we analyzed expression from ETEs. Because the plasmid pΔBM-d2EGFP contains the d2EGFP expression cassette, which produces an enhanced GFP with a very short cellular half-life, we measured green fluorescence by flow cytometry as previously described (10.Shimizu N. Hanada N. Utani K. Sekiguchi N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We found that d2EGFP expression was lower in cells with the linear plasmid than in cells with the supercoiled plasmid (Fig. 4A). This difference may be explained by the frequency of HSRs (Fig. 3A), although most of the HSRs were silenced (10.Shimizu N. Hanada N. Utani K. Sekiguchi N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Another explanation is that exonucleolytic digestion of the linear molecule in transfected cells might destroy the promoter, because the cytomegalovirus promoter that drives the d2EGFP gene is adjacent to the end of the linear DNA. Southern analysis showed that such digestion actively took place (see below). In contrast, if the hairpin cap was added to the same linear DNA, it generated cells with much higher levels of expression (Fig. 4A). Because the HSR was not detected between the cell population (Fig. 3A), the expression seen in Fig. 4 mostly reflects the expression from ETEs. We show below that the plasmid with a hairpin end was not digested as a linear molecule but that the structure diverged during clonal growth, which might also destroy the flanking cytomegalovirus promoter. Therefore, gene expression from hairpin-derived ETEs might be higher than that from supercoil-derived HSRs. Therefore, application of the hairpin-capped IR/MAR plasmid to protein production may be a future task. Gene expression in supercoil-derived transformants decreased significantly during cellular passage, which suggests the progression of epigenetic gene silencing in HSR, as we previously showed (10.Shimizu N. Hanada N. Utani K. Sekiguchi N. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11.Utani K. Shimizu N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that expression in hairpin molecule-derived transformants did not significantly decrease (Fig. 4B). This suggested that epigenetic gene silencing might be weak in ETEs. Because epigenetic silencing is usually mediated by DNA methylation and/or histone deacetylation, we examined the effect of drugs that inhibit such processes (Fig. 4C). Indeed, many of the histone deacetylase inhibitors examined (butylate, trichostatin A, MS-275, oxamflatin, and dimethyl sulfoxide) as well as the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine greatly increased gene expression from ETEs, showing that the epigenetic mechanism suppressed gene expression not only in HSRs but also in ETEs. The extrachromosomal environment is generally supposed to be refractory to epigenetic silencing. However, the result reported here suggests that this is not always the case. We extracted total DNA from polyclonal transformants that were generated with supercoiled, linear, or hairpin-capped pΔBM-d2EGFP plasmid DNA. We digested the DNA with HindIII, which cuts the original plasmid at several sites (Fig. 5A), and analyzed these restriction products by Southern hybridization using the entire plasmid DNA as a probe (Fig. 5B). DNA from the supercoiled molecule-derived transformant produced hybridization bands that were identical to those of the original supercoiled pΔBM-d2EGFP DNA (compare lane 2 with lane 1). This confirmed our previous result, and it showed that the covalently closed circular IR/MAR plasmid was amplified and arranged as a direct repeat in DMs or HSRs (5.Shimizu N. Hashizume T. Shingaki K. Kawamoto J.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5281-5290PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the 5,603-bp fragment was not observed in the linear molecule-derived transformant (open box in lane 3), whereas another three bands (1,039, 1,631, and 2,434 bp) were present. Because the original 5,603-bp band contained the MluI site where the plasmid was linearized, this result strongly suggested that linear plasmids were exonucleolytically digested from the ends before ligating with each other in transfected cells, so that the 5,603-bp band became a faint smear. Strikingly, the result was rather different for hairpin-capped molecule-derived transformants. Namely, in addition to the conserved three bands from the internal sequence, there were many hybridization bands instead of the 5,603-bp band. These bands were likely derived from hairpin-capped MluI ends. To understand these extra bands, we isolated several clones from hairpin-capped plasmid transformants. We analyzed 20 clones by FISH and selected eight clones that bear ETEs as the sole location of plasmid sequences. Because the images were very close to the representative ETE images (Fig. 2, E–H), they are not shown. Another 12 clones had no significant FISH signals, which was consistent with the result on polyclonal transformant (Fig. 3). For such ETE-bearing clones, we performed Southern analysis as above (Fig. 5C). As a result, a few discrete bands appeared for each clone in addition to the conserved three bands. These extra bands were rather different between the clones and even different from the bands appearing for the polyclonal cells, from which the clones derived. Because the cloned cells were cultured for more than 2 months after the analysis on the polyclone, the structure of the hairpin-capped end may intermittently diverge during cellular propagation. We showed that the generation of ETEs from the hairpin-capped plasmid required the IR sequence (Fig. 3), suggesting a requirement for DNA replication. If a hairpin-capped linear molecule is replicated, it necessarily produces a palindrome sequence, as shown in Fig. 6A. Therefore, we wanted to detect this palindrome in transformants. However, amplification of the palindrome by conventional PCR was difficult, because such a sequence might form a cruciform extrusion. Therefore, we treated total DNA from transformants with sodium bisulfite to convert nonmethylated cytosine to uracil. After that, we performed PCR using a specific primer set (Fig. 6B, a-a′) that would amplify a product if the palindrome were present. If total DNA from a supercoiled plasmid-derived transformant was used as a template, PCR did not amplify any product (Fig. 6B, lane 1). In contrast, a product with the expected size (792 bp; Fig. 6A) was amplified from a hairpin-derived transformant (Fig. 6B, lane 2). On the other hand, a product of the same size was amplified from the original hairpin-capped linear DNA, as predicted (data not shown). We next ligated the PCR product with the vector, cloned it in E. coli, and determined the base sequences of the inserts. For clones 3 and 6, there were two kinds of inserts that differ their length, and we sequenced both of them. By comparing the sequence with the original hairpin-capped plasmid sequence, we found that the sequences from clone 4 and clone 6-1 were identical, and they perfectly matched to the complete palindrome sequence from the original hairpin end (Fig. 6, D and E). On the other hand, the sequences from clones 3-2 and 6-2 were identical. This sequence and the one from clone 3-1 also contained almost the complete palindrome deduced from the MluI end of the plasmid, but they lacked the loop region of the synthetic hairpin (Fig. 6E). Generation of such a structure was most plausibly explained by the fact that the loop region of the hairpin was resected by a single-strand specific nuclease and an exonuclease, followed by the intrastrand annealing using microhomology and repair, which generate another hairpin end. Such a mechanism was suggested to be involved in the initiation of gene amplification (27.Tanaka H. Cao Y. Bergstrom D.A. Kooperberg C. Tapscott S.J. Yao M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1993-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was very surprising that the structure identical to the hairpin-capped end or its replicated form, i.e. palindrome, was preserved for more than 3 months after the transfection. We next addressed how frequently plasmid copy number was associated with the palindrome structure. Thus, we simultaneously performed a conventional PCR by using another set of primers (Fig. 6A, b–b′) that amplified a portion of the plasmid apart from the hairpin. The intensity of the b-b′ product should reflect the amount of plasmid sequence, whereas the intensity of the a-a′ product should reflect the amount of palindrome. It is uncertain whether the efficiency of amplification might differ between two sets of primer, but we considered the comparison would provide a rough estimate. The result (Fig. 6C) showed that the polyclonal transformant contained a significant amount of the palindrome (compare lanes 1 and 5 at 24 and 26 cycles). However, the amount of palindrome varied significantly among individual clones (compare lanes 2–4 and lanes 6–8, respectively). This result was consistent with the Southern blot data, which suggested the presence of heterogeneity among clones near the hairpin cap-derived sequence (Fig. 5). From the above evidence, we propose a model that explains how the hairpin-capped plasmid is maintained in cells in an IR/MAR-dependent fashion (Fig. 7). Our results suggest that the hairpin-capped molecule is replicated in cells to form a circular inverted dimer. Such a molecule has two palindromes, which may be converted to a cruciform. This structure is recognized by the Holliday junction resolvase and cleaved to form an additional hairpin-capped end. If the replication machinery reaches the cruciform, then so-called “replication slippage” might occur. This may explain why the structure around the originally hairpin-capped end becomes diverged among clones. On the other hand, the intensity of bands observed by Southern hybridization applied on cloned cells (Fig. 5C) suggested that between 200 and 2,000 copies of the plasmid sequences are present in each cloned cell, whereas FISH images indicated that each cell contained ∼50–200 copies of ETEs. Therefore, a rough calculation suggests that each ETE consists of 5–10 copies of plasmid sequences on average. On the other hand, the data in Fig. 6 showed that the ETE contained a palindrome. Therefore, transcription of the palindrome would produce a double-stranded RNA that efficiently induces RNA interference and silences plasmid sequences. This proposal is consistent with the finding that ETEs were epigenetically silenced (Fig. 4). The conversion of a palindrome to a hairpin-capped end has been suggested for yeast. Such hairpin-capped ends may trigger a breakage-fusion-bridge cycle and gene amplification, if they are chromosomally located (17.Narayanan V. Mieczkowski P.A. Kim H.M. Petes T.D. Lobachev K.S. Cell. 2006; 125: 1283-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 19.Lobachev K.S. Rattray A. Narayanan V. Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 4208-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This process preferentially occurs under conditions where hairpin processing activity is compromised (18.Lobachev K.S. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Cell. 2002; 108: 183-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent report showed that episomal palindromes launch a self-perpetuating breakage-fusion-bridge-independent increase in copy number termed “escape,” if the hairpin is not processed by Mre11 nuclease activity (21.Coté A.G. Lewis S.M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 800-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This phenomenon appears very similar to what happens in our experimental system. Here, ETE formation from the hairpin-capped plasmids was observed in human COLO 320DM cells, but we could not detect this in HeLa or CHO-K1 cells, 4M. Uchida and N. Shimizu, unpublished observation. suggesting that a hairpin processing activity might be missing in COLO 320 cells. However, microarray analysis revealed that Mre11 as well as the mammalian Holliday junction resolvase (containing Eme1 and Mus81) (28.Hiyama T. Katsura M. Yoshihara T. Ishida M. Kinomura A. Tonda T. Asahara T. Miyagawa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 880-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) is expressed normally in COLO 320 cells. 5S. Harada, unpublished data. Therefore, determining the genetic background that supports the stable maintenance of hairpin-capped IR/MAR plasmids is an important future task. We have made a serendipitous finding that a hairpin-capped linear molecule with an IR/MAR sequence may be maintained as numerous episomes in mammalian cells, and we have proposed a mechanism underlying this process. This study provides a novel method to develop an episomal vector in mammalian cells. Until now, several papers have reported the development of episomal vectors for mammalian cells (29.Jenke A.C. Stehle I.M. Herrmann F. Eisenberger T. Baiker A. Bode J. Fackelmayer F.O. Lipps H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 11322-11327Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 30.Schaarschmidt D. Baltin J. Stehle I.M. Lipps H.J. Knippers R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); however, such vectors still pose a difficult challenge except for those using viral elements for replication/segregation. However, sequences that support autonomous replication (the replicator sequence) have been identified in bacteria and yeast cells by isolating sequences that support episomal maintenance. Because of the lack of an episomal system in mammalian cells, studies of replicator activity have completely depended on the analysis of replication initiation at ectopic chromosomal loci, which in turn depends on chromosomal context (31.Aladjem M.I. Fanning E. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The findings reported here will provide an ideal system for analyzing replicator activity in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2089375925,"Predicting the allergenicity of proteins is challenging. We considered the possibility that the properties of the intact protein that may alter the likelihood of being taken up by antigen presenting cells, may be useful adjuncts in predicting allergens and non-allergens in silico. It has been shown that negatively charged acidic proteins are preferentially processed by dendritic cells.Datasets (aeroallergen, food-allergen and non-allergen) for in-silico study were obtained from public databases. Isoelectric point (pI), net charge, and electrostatic potential (EP) were calculated from the protein sequence (for pI and net charge) or predicted structure (for EP).Allergens and non allergens differed significantly in pI, net charge, and EP (p<0.0001). Cluster analysis based on these parameters resulted in well defined clusters. Non-allergens were characterized by neutral to basic pI (mean+/-SE, 7.6+/-0.16) and positive charge. In contrast allergens were acidic (5.7+/-0.15) and negatively charged. Surface electrostatic potentials calculated from predicted structures were mostly negative for allergens and mostly positive for non-allergens. The classification accuracy for non-allergens was superior to that for allergens. Thus neutral to basic pI, positive charge, and positive electrostatic potentials characterize non-allergens, and seem rare in allergens (p<0.0001). It may be possible to predict reduced likelihood of allergenicity in such proteins, but this needs to be prospectively validated."
https://openalex.org/W2030241187,"Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, encodes several essential virulence factors on a 70 kb plasmid, including the Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) and a multifunctional virulence antigen (V). V is uniquely able to inhibit the host immune response; aid in the expression, secretion, and injection of the cytotoxic Yops via a type III secretion system (T3SS)-dependent mechanism; be secreted extracellularly; and enter the host cell by a T3SS-independent mechanism, where its activity is unknown. To elucidate the intracellular trafficking and target(s) of V, time-course experiments were performed with macrophages (MPhis) infected with Y. pestis or Y. pseudotuberculosis at intervals from 5 min to 6 h. The trafficking pattern was discerned from results of parallel microscopy, immunoblotting, and flow cytometry experiments. The MPhis were incubated with fluorescent or gold conjugated primary or secondary anti-V (antibodies [Abs]) in conjunction with organelle-associated Abs or dyes. The samples were observed for co-localization by immuno-fluorescence and electron microscopy. For fractionation studies, uninfected and infected MPhis were lysed and subjected to density gradient centrifugation coupled with immunoblotting with Abs to V or to organelles. Samples were also analyzed by flow cytometry after lysis and dual-staining with anti-V and anti-organelle Abs. Our findings indicate a co-localization of V with (1) endosomal proteins between 10-45 min of infection, (2) lysosomal protein(s) between 1-2 h of infection, (3) mitochondrial proteins between 2.5-3 h infection, and (4) Golgi protein(s) between 4-6 h of infection. Further studies are being performed to determine the specific intracellular interactions and role in pathogenesis of intracellularly localized V."
