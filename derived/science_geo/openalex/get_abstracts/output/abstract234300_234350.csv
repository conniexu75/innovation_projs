https://openalex.org/W2036581369,"THE anterior pituitary factors concerned in the initiation of lactation are different from those capable of amplifying an existing milk flow (see reviews, refs. 1, 2), and Folley and Young3 suggest that the term ‘galactopoietic’ be applied to an anterior pituitary substance which can augment established lactation irrespective of whether or not it can initiate the secretion of milk. Bergman and Turner4 independently suggested the use of the words ‘galactopoetic’ or ‘galactogogue’ in a similar sense."

https://openalex.org/W2038689251,"As the structure of the dinitrogen tetroxide molecule has recently been the subject of discussion1, it may be of interest to record the following measurements, obtained from an X-ray study of single crystals of this compound. Previous diffraction work has been recorded by Vegard2 and re-interpreted by Hendricks3, but as this was confined to powder specimens the evidence is not conclusive."
https://openalex.org/W2006735167,"Cook, Heilbron and Levy1 have recently prepared tetraglycylglycine and several di-peptides by reaction of 2-thio-5-thiazolones with amino-acid derivatives. During the past few years, much interest has also been shown in the polymerization potentialities of the N-carboxy anhydrides of α-amino-acids2–5. Study of the reaction of these anhydrides with simple organic bases has now indicated the mechanism of their polymerization and provided a new method of building up polypeptides by addition of single amino-acid units."

It appears to affect cellular growth processes as shown by (a) the production of mammary carcinoma of the mouse and testicular tumours in 'Strong A' strain mice, (6) its ability to cause regression of human and animal prostsreic cancer and human breast tumour."

https://openalex.org/W2072269498,"THE part played by carbohydrates in the synthesis of acetylcholine in animal tissues is at present far from clear. It was first shown by Quastel, Tennenbaum and Wheatley1 that the formation of free acetylcholine by brain cortex slices is dependent upon respiration in a physiological medium containing either glucose, lactate or pyruvate, and later by Mann, Tennenbaum and Quastel2that a bound form of acetylcholine exists in brain tissue which is synthesized when brain respires in the presence of glucose, lactate or pyruvate. These authors pointed out that acetylcholine formation in brain slices was always high under those conditions which produce either a high aerobic glycolysis or a high respiration. They suggested the presence of a definite link between the two metabolic processes, one involving glucose breakdown and the other acetylcholine formation. It was further suggested that synthesis depends upon the absorption of energy supplied by oxidative reactions taking place during the combustion of glucose, lactate or pyruvate ; but it was emphasized that, anaerobically, in presence of glucose when extensive glycolysis is taking place, little or no synthesis of acetylcholine occurs with brain slices or minced tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1975132211,"IT is well known that fat is well absorbed by man when consumed in amounts of 50-150 gm. per day. Under,,these conditions, the apparent absorption of fat (I - F/I X 100, where I is intake of fat and F the Amount excreted in the faeces) is more than 90 pef'cent, less than this proportion being considered pathological. When the intake of fat is relatively low, however, the apparent percentage absorption is greatly reduced (58-62 per cent)1,2. The purpose of this communication is to provide evidence that the fat which is excreted in the fæces, and which is assumed to be unabsorbed fat in calculating the apparent absorption, is mainly of non-dietary origin, and that the true absorption of fat is not necessarily lower when the intake of fat is reduced. The evidence, which is based on the study of diets of different fat and crude fibre contents, also indicates that the additional amount of fat which is excreted in the fseces when the fibre content of a diet is greatly increased3 is not unabsorbed fat, but is probably wholly of endogenous origin."

https://openalex.org/W2075498060,"IT was recently found by Gabrielsen1 that leaves of elder (Sambucus nigra), enclosed either in ordinary air of 0.03 per cent carbon dioxide content or air poor in carbon dioxide (0.0024 per cent) and illuminated with light of 1,100 foot-candles intensity, brought the carbon dioxide content to a constant value of about 0·009 per cent. He has suggested1,2 that this 0·009 per cent represents a threshold value below which no photosynthesis can take place. Audus· found that even at high light intensities leafy shoofs of cherry laurel gave out carbon dioxide into a srfow stream of carbon dioxide - free air, although F. F. Blackman4 and Maskell5 had found no detectable quantity of carbon dioxide emitted by illuminated leaves under such conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1964568978,"Dufrenoy and Reed1, in their study of coacervation in hypoplastic cells, demonstrated some important correlations with the respiratory activities in vacuoles, and they also suggested that a similar correlation between dwarfed shoots and coacervation was shown as the result of zinc deficiency in apricots and walnuts2. However, the effect of zinc on the respiration of plants has not hitherto been described. It is possible to determine the relationship between zinc and respiration by direct measurements of oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide evolution by the normal and zinc-deficient plants."

https://openalex.org/W2034964544,"DURING the recent meeting of the British Association at Newcastle upon Tyne, Section A (Mathematics and Physics) held a symposium on ultrasonics in fluids. Most of the papers read at this symposium, concerned applications of the ultrasonic interferometer, which may be regarded as a modern development of the familiar Kundt's tube into a precision instrument for studying those properties of gases and liquids which come into play when the molecules are set into vibration as a whole. In essence, the instrument consists of a quartz crystal in piezo-electric vibration, sending out plane waves into the fluid which are reflected back to the crystal, there to react upon the circuit which maintains the piezo-electric oscillations. The reflector usually consists of a plate mounted on a micrometer screw which is carried parallel to itself in a direction perpendicular to the ultrasonic wave-front, thereby recalling several types of optical interferometer. In the original method of Pierce, the magnitude of the resonance, as indicated by the maintaining circuit, at each half wave-length shift of the screw is observed through the change in the anode current of the circuit. With some precautions, the magnitudes of these current changes may be used to calculate the absorption coefficient of the radiation in the fluid, and, of course, the screw settings for these resonances enable the velocity in the fluid to be calculated if the frequency of the crystal oscillations can be accurately measured."

https://openalex.org/W2087117931,"IN a recent letter, Mr. D. W. Heightman1 has given some interesting evidence for tropospheric influences on radio wave propagation in the short- and medium-wave bands. Some measurements made in July 1945 on wave-lengths in the range 60–300 metres confirm the existence of such influences. During the course of a programme of ionospheric eclipse observations conducted by the Radio Division of the National Physical Laboratory, at Loth (Sutherland), it was found that echo signals of appreciable amplitude appeared at ranges of 45 km. and 65 km. These signals could be identified as reflexions from mountains and were observed at all frequencies in the range 1–5 Mc./s. Amplitude measurements made each day over a period of a week established the following points."

Hill asks that the word be used in its original sense, that is, as the plural of datum, for which he gives the ""Oxford English Dictionary"" definition ""A thing given or granted"" and so on. He adds that there may sometimes be an excuse for regarding data as a collective singular in the same way as agenda."
https://openalex.org/W4246623021,"A GENERAL discussion on ""Chromatographic Analysis was held by the Faraday Society at the University of Reading during September 22–24, with Sir John Lennard-Jones in the chair. The programme began with an introductory address by Prof. A. Tiselius who gave a brief summary of the earlier work on chromatography and on the modern methods which are now used to separate inorganic and organic materials. He pointed out the value of the counter-current extraction method of Craig and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of frontal, elution and displacement analysis. He also commented on the important observation that silica becomes a specific adsorbent for methyl orange when it is co-precipitated with this indicator. A new specific method for the isolation of substances thus becomes available."
