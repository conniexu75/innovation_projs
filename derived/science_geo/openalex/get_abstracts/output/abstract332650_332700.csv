https://openalex.org/W2000961866,"Pioneer Venus ultraviolet spectra from the first 5 years of operation show a decline (by more than a factor of 10) in sulfur dioxide abundance at the cloud tops and in the amount of submicron haze above the clouds. At the time of the Pioneer Venus encounter, the values for both parameters greatly exceeded earlier upper limits. However, Venus had a similar appearance in the late 1950's, implying the episodic injection of sulfur dioxide possibly caused by episodic volcanism. The amount of haze in the Venus middle atmosphere is about ten times that found in Earth's stratosphere after the most recent major volcanic eruptions, and the thermal energy required for this injection on Venus is greater by about an order of magnitude than the largest of these recent Earth eruptions and about as large as the Krakatoa eruption of 1883. The episodic behavior of sulfur dioxide implies that steady-state models of the chemistry and dynamics of cloud-top regions may be of limited use."

Numerous improvements are being developed to make conversion of plant biomass to methane and simultaneous waste stabilization-methane production practical. Among these improvements are innovative digester designs and process configurations. Efforts to commercialize modern anaerobic digestion technology are progressing."
https://openalex.org/W2093178664,"Examination of genotypes of female-pup nursing pairs taken from large maternity colonies of the Mexican free-tailed bat in Texas demonstrates that nursing is nonrandom and selective along genetic (kinship) lines. This is contrary to previous reports that nursing in these colonies is indiscriminate. Although nursing is nonrandom, an estimated 17 percent of the females sampled were nursing pups that could not be their offspring. This ""nonparental"" nursing is an apparent result of the difficulties females face in consistently relocating and selectively nursing their own pups within these enormous colonies."
https://openalex.org/W2070453739,The wingless first instars of the coccid Pulvinariella mesembryanthemi exhibit active aerial dispersal behavior by standing on their hind legs. This behavior is an age-specific response to the ambient wind velocity by which the instars are able to capitalize on air velocity gradients in the thin boundary layer surrounding the host plant substrate. This dispersal tactic may be a convergent evolutionary strategy for many minute terrestrial arthropods.

https://openalex.org/W1967714966,"Abelsonite, a C(31) nickel-porphyrin of the deoxophylloerythroetioporphyrin type, is shown to have methyl groups in the 2, 3, 7, 12, and 18 positions and ethyl groups in the 8 and 17 positions by high-resolution, high-field (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance and nuclear Overhauser effect studies. Removal of the nickel by treatment with methanesulfonic acid permitted confirmation of the structure on the free base porphyrin and demonstrated structural integrity under the conditions required for demetallation. The structure is best accounted for geochemically by the hypothesis that abelsonite is derived from a chlorophyll."
