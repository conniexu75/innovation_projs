https://openalex.org/W2904101917,"The influence of nanomaterials on the ecological environment is becoming an increasingly hot research field, and many researchers are exploring the mechanisms of nanomaterial toxicity on microorganisms. Herein, we studied the effect of two different sizes of nanosilver (10 nm and 50 nm) on the soil nitrogen fixation by the model bacteria Azotobacter vinelandii. Smaller size AgNPs correlated with higher toxicity, which was evident from reduced cell numbers. Flow cytometry analysis further confirmed this finding, which was carried out with the same concentration of 10 mg/L for 12 h, the apoptotic rates were20.23% and 3.14% for 10 nm and 50 nm AgNPs, respectively. Structural damage to cells were obvious under scanning electron microscopy. Nitrogenase activity and gene expression assays revealed that AgNPs could inhibit the nitrogen fixation of A. vinelandii. The presence of AgNPs caused intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and electron spin resonance further demonstrated that AgNPs generated hydroxyl radicals, and that AgNPs could cause oxidative damage to bacteria. A combination of Ag content distribution assays and transmission electron microscopy indicated that AgNPs were internalized in A. vinelandii cells. Overall, this study suggested that the toxicity of AgNPs was size and concentration dependent, and the mechanism of antibacterial effects was determined to involve damage to cell membranes and production of reactive oxygen species leading to enzyme inactivation, gene down-regulation and death by apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2904832916,"Background During epidemic crises, some of the information the public receives on social media is misinformation. Health organizations are required to respond and correct the information to gain the public’s trust and influence it to follow the recommended instructions. Objectives (1) To examine ways for health organizations to correct misinformation concerning the measles vaccination on social networks for two groups: pro-vaccination and hesitant; (2) To examine the types of reactions of two subgroups (pro-vaccination, hesitant) to misinformation correction; and (3) To examine the effect of misinformation correction on these two subgroups regarding reliability, satisfaction, self-efficacy and intentions. Methods A controlled experiment with participants divided randomly into two conditions. In both experiment conditions a dilemma was presented as to sending a child to kindergarten, followed by an identical Facebook post voicing the children mothers’ concerns. In the third stage the correction by the health organization is presented differently in two conditions: Condition 1 –common information correction, and Condition 2 –recommended (theory-based) information correction, mainly communicating information transparently and addressing the public’s concerns. The study included (n = 243) graduate students from the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at Haifa University. Results A statistically significant difference was found in the reliability level attributed to information correction by the Health Ministry between the Control condition and Experimental condition (sig<0.001), with the average reliability level of the subjects in Condition 2 (M = 5.68) being considerably higher than the average reliability level of subjects in Condition 1 (4.64). A significant difference was found between Condition 1 and Condition 2 (sig<0.001), with the average satisfaction from the Health Ministry’s response of Condition 2 subjects (M = 5.75) being significantly higher than the average satisfaction level of Condition 1 subjects (4.66). Similarly, when we tested the pro and hesitant groups separately, we found that both preferred the response presented in Condition 2. Conclusion It is very important for the organizations to correct misinformation transparently, and to address the emotional aspects for both the pro-vaccination and the hesitant groups. The pro-vaccination group is not a captive audience, and it too requires a full response that addresses the public's fears and concerns."
https://openalex.org/W2903925660,"Importance ICU-acquired muscle atrophy occurs commonly and worsens outcomes in adults. The incidence and severity of muscle atrophy in critically ill children are poorly characterized. Objective To determine incidence, severity and risk factors for muscle atrophy in critically ill children. Design, setting and participants A single-center, prospective cohort study of 34 children receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for ≥48 hours. Patients 1 week– 18 years old with respiratory failure and without preexisting neuromuscular disease or skeletal trauma were recruited from a tertiary Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) between June 2015 and May 2016. We used serial bedside ultrasound to assess thickness of the diaphragm, biceps brachii/brachialis, quadriceps femoris and tibialis anterior. Serial electrical impedance myography (EIM) was assessed in children >1 year old. Medical records were abstracted from an electronic database. Exposures Respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation for ≥48 hours. Main outcome and measures The primary outcome was percent change in muscle thickness. Secondary outcomes were changes in EIM-derived fat percentage and “quality”. Results Of 34 enrolled patients, 30 completed ≥2 ultrasound assessments with a median interval of 6 (IQR 6–7) days. Mean age was 5.42 years, with 12 infants <1 year (40%) and 18 children >1 year old (60%). In the entire cohort, diaphragm thickness decreased 11.1% (95%CI, -19.7% to -2.52%) between the first two assessments or 2.2%/day. Quadriceps thickness decreased 8.62% (95%CI, -15.7% to -1.54%) or 1.5%/day. Biceps (-1.71%; 95%CI, -8.15% to 4.73%) and tibialis (0.52%; 95%CI, -5.81% to 3.40%) thicknesses did not change. Among the entire cohort, 47% (14/30) experienced diaphragm atrophy (defined a priori as ≥10% decrease in thickness). Eighty three percent of patients (25/30) experienced atrophy in ≥1 muscle group, and 47% (14/30)—in ≥2 muscle groups. On multivariate linear regression, increasing age and traumatic brain injury (TBI) were associated with greater muscle loss. EIM revealed increased fat percentage and decreased muscle “quality”. Conclusions and relevance In children receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, diaphragm and other skeletal muscle atrophy is common and rapid. Increasing age and TBI may increase severity of limb muscle atrophy. Prospective studies are required to link muscle atrophy to functional outcomes in critically ill children."
https://openalex.org/W2904612967,"Objectives Several studies have indicated that early pet keeping could protect the infant from later allergy development. Here, we investigate if there is a dose-dependent association between cat- and dog-keeping during the first year of life and subsequent allergy development. Methods Two cohorts were investigated: a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study of 7- to 8-year-old children (N = 1029) from Mölndal and Kiruna, and a birth-cohort of children from the Västra Götaland county clinically evaluated for asthma and allergy by paediatricians up to the age of 8–9 years (N = 249). The cross-sectional study asked validated questions on asthma and allergy that had been used in two previous studies of children from the same areas. In the birth-cohort study, a diagnosis of asthma and allergy was based on predefined clinical criteria, and laboratory evaluation included blood eosinophils, skin-prick tests and specific immunoglobulin E analyses. Information on pets during first year of life was collected retrospectively in the Cross-Sectional Cohort and prospectively in the Birth Cohort. Results A dose-response association was seen, with less allergic manifestations (any of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, or eczema) with increasing number of household cats and dogs during the first year of life. In the Cross-Sectional Cohort, allergy ever decreased from 49% in those with no pets to zero in those with five or more pets (P-value for trend 0.038), and from 32% to zero for allergy last year (P-value for trend 0.006). The same pattern was seen in Birth Cohort. Sensitization to animals, as well as pollens, also decreased with increasing number of animals in the household. Conclusion The prevalence of allergic disease in children aged 7–9 years is reduced in a dose-dependent fashion with the number of household pets living with the child during their first year of life, suggesting a “mini-farm” effect, whereby cats and dogs protect against allergy development."
https://openalex.org/W2904429655,"Self-control plays an important role in human’s daily life. In the recent two decades, scholars have exerted tremendous effort to examine the etiologies of the individual differences in self-control. Among numerous predictors of self-control, the role of culture has been relatively overlooked. In this study, the influences of cultural orientation on self-control were examined based on the collectivism-individualism framework using both self-report and behavioral task to assess self-control. A convenience sample of 542 Chinese and 446 U.S. undergraduates participated in the research. They were invited to fill out self-report questionnaires reporting their levels of attitudinal self-control and individualistic-collectivistic orientation after completing a computer-based Stroop task. Results of hierarchical regression models showed that Chinese participants reported less attitudinal self-control but had higher behavioral self-control than their U.S. counterparts. Moreover, individual-level individualism and collectivism was negatively and positively related to attitudinal self-control in both countries, respectively. Individual-level collectivism was significantly related to better behavioral self-control, but no significant results were found for the relationship between individual-level individualism and behavioral self-control. In sum, individualism and collectivism have some influences on individual differences in self-control. Implications for future research were discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2905169108,"We conducted a randomized control study to improve equity in how work is taken up, assigned and rewarded in academic departments. We used a four-part intervention targeting routine work practices, department conditions, and the readiness of faculty to intervene to shape more equitable outcomes over an 18-month period. Our goal was to (a) increase the number of routine work practices that department faculty could enact to ensure equity, (b) enhance conditions within the department known to positively enhance equity, and (c) improve the action readiness of department faculty to ensure equity in division of labor. Post intervention faculty in participating departments were more likely than before the intervention to report work practices and conditions that support equity and action readiness in their department, and that teaching and service work in their department is fair. Participating departments were significantly more likely than control departments to report practices and conditions that support equity and greater action readiness to address issues of workload equity in their department. Finally, participating department faculty were more likely than control department faculty to report increased self-advocacy and were more likely than control department faculty to report that the distribution of teaching and service work in their department is fair."
https://openalex.org/W2904561881,"As mechanical properties of cell culture substrates matter, methods for mechanical characterization of scaffolds on a relevant length scale are required. We used multiple particle tracking microrheology to close the gap between elasticity determined from bulk measurements and elastic properties sensed by cells. Structure and elasticity of macroporous, three-dimensional cryogel scaffolds from mixtures of hyaluronic acid (HA) and collagen (Coll) were characterized. Both one-component gels formed homogeneous networks, whereas hybrid gels were heterogeneous in terms of elasticity. Most strikingly, local elastic moduli were significantly lower than bulk moduli presumably due to non-equilibrium chain conformations between crosslinks. This was more pronounced in Coll and hybrid gels than in pure HA gels. Local elastic moduli were similar for all gels, irrespective of their different swelling ratio and bulk moduli. Fibroblast cell culture proved the biocompatibility of all investigated compositions. Coll containing gels enabled cell migration, adhesion and proliferation inside the gels."
https://openalex.org/W2905011910,"Aragonite (along with calcite) is one of the most common polymorphs of the crystalline calcium carbonate that forms the skeletal structures of organisms, but it has relatively low preservation potential. Under ambient conditions and in the presence of water, aragonite transforms into calcite, the stable polymorph. Aragonite is also more soluble therefore, in water-permeable siliceous limestones (opokas) that are typical of Upper Cretaceous deposits of Poland and Ukraine, the primary aragonitic skeletons are either entirely dissolved and found as moulds and casts or transformed into secondary calcite, whereas the primary calcitic shells remain well preserved. Contrary to the common notion of the lack of aragonite in such porous carbonate deposits, we show that relics of aragonite can be preserved as a nacreous lining on cephalopod moulds or as thin, lenticular structures entrapped in neomorphic calcite. Based on the observed intermediate steps of aragonite alteration, we propose an extended model of nacre diagenesis. Among the originally aragonitic biota, only nautilids and ammonites have retained relics of pristine skeletons. Such selective preservation of only some aragonitic structures (nacre but not the prismatic aragonitic layers) points to the role of microstructural and biochemical differences between cephalopod shell layers that may set a threshold for the dissolution, dissolution/precipitation or preservation of original biomineral structures."
https://openalex.org/W2905245368,"There is limited information on the epidemiology and treatment patterns of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) across the Arab region. We aim in this study to describe the demographic characteristics, clinical profile, and treatment patterns of patients of Arab ancestry with RA.This is a cross sectional study of 895 patients with established rheumatoid arthritis enrolled from five sites (Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), and United Arab Emirates). Demographic characteristics, clinical profile, and treatment patterns are compared between the five countries.The majority of our patients are women, have an average disease duration of 10 years, are married and non-smokers, with completed secondary education. We report a high (>80%) ever-use of methotrexate (MTX) and steroids among our RA population, while the ever-use of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and TNF-inhibitors average around 67% and 33%, respectively. There are variations in RA treatment use between the five country sites. Highest utilization of steroids is identified in Jordan and KSA (p-value < 0.001), while the highest ever-use of TNF-inhibitors is reported in KSA (p-value < 0.001).Disparities in usage of RA treatments among Arab patients are noted across the five countries. National gross domestic product (GDP), as well as some other unique features in each country likely affect these. Developing treatment guidelines specific to this region could contribute in delivering standardized therapies to RA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2904954126,"Seepage of methane (CH4) on land and in the sea may significantly affect Earth’s biogeochemical cycles. However processes of CH4 generation and consumption, both abiotic and microbial, are not always clear. We provide new geochemical and isotope data to evaluate if a recently discovered CH4 seepage from the shallow seafloor close to the Island of Elba (Tuscany) and two small islands nearby are derived from abiogenic or biogenic sources and whether carbonate encrusted vents are the result of microbial or abiotic processes. Emission of gas bubbles (predominantly CH4) from unlithified sands was observed at seven spots in an area of 100 m2 at Pomonte (Island of Elba), with a total rate of 234 ml m-2 d-1. The measured carbon isotope values of CH4 of around -18‰ (VPDB) in combination with the measured δ2H value of -120‰ (VSMOW) and the inverse correlation of δ13C-value with carbon number of hydrocarbon gases are characteristic for sites of CH4 formation through abiogenic processes, specifically abiogenic formation of CH4 via reduction of CO2 by H2. The H2 for methanogenesis likely derives from ophiolitic host rock within the Ligurian accretionary prism. The lack of hydrothermal activity allows CH4 gas to become decoupled from the stagnant aqueous phase. Hence no hyperalkaline fluid is currently released at the vent sites. Within the seep area a decrease in porewater sulphate concentrations by ca. 5 mmol/l relative to seawater and a concomitant increase in sulphide and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) indicate substantial activity of sulphate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). In absence of any other dissimilatory pathway, the δ13C-values between -17 and -5‰ in dissolved inorganic carbon and aragonite cements suggest that the inorganic carbon is largely derived from CH4. The formation of seep carbonates is thus microbially induced via anaerobic oxidation of abiotic CH4."
https://openalex.org/W2903634270,"Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the commonest cancers associated with diverse prognosis times in different parts of the world. Despite medical interventions, the overall clinical outcomes and survival remains very poor for most patients in developing countries. This study therefore investigated the survival rate of colorectal cancer and its prognostic factors among patients at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Ghana. Methodology In this retrospective cohort study, a total of 221 patients diagnosed with CRC from 2009 to 2015 at the Surgical and Oncological units of Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Kumasi, Ghana were employed. The survival graphs were obtained using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by the Log-rank test. Cox regression analysis was used to assess prognostic factors. All analyses were performed by SPSS version 22. Results The median survival time was 15 months 95% CI (11.79–18.21). The overall survival rate for CRC over the 5 years period was 16.0%. The survival rates at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th years were 64% 95% CI (56.2–71.1), 40% 95% CI (32.2–50.1), 21% 95% CI (11.4–30.6) 16% 95% CI (8.9–26.9) and 16% 95% CI (7.3–24.9). There was a significant difference in the survival rate of colorectal cancer according to the different stages (p = 0.0001). Family history [HR = (3.44), p = 0.029)], Chemotherapy [HR = (0.23), p = <0.0001)], BMI [HR = (1.78), p = 0.017)] and both chemo/radiotherapy (HR = (3.63), p = 0.042)] were the significant social and clinical factors influencing the overall survival. Pathological factors such as TNM tumour stage (p = 0.012), depth of tumour invasion (p = 0.036), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0001), and distance metastasis (p = 0.001) were significantly associated with overall survival. Conclusion The study has clearly demonstrated that survival rate for CRC patients at KATH, Ghana is very low in a 5 years period. This is influenced by significant number of clinical and pathological prognostic factors. Identification of prognostic factors would be a primary basis for early prediction and treatment of patients with colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2903801131,"Lameness is a key health and welfare issue affecting commercial herds of dairy cattle, with potentially significant economic impacts due to the expense of treatment and lost milk production. Existing lameness detection methods can be time-intensive, and under-detection remains a significant problem leading to delayed or missed treatment. Hence, there is a need for automated monitoring systems that can quickly and accurately detect lameness in individual cows within commercial dairy herds. Recent advances in sensor tracking technology have made it possible to observe the movement, behaviour and space-use of a range of animal species over extended time-scales. However, little is known about how observed movement behaviour and space-use patterns in individual dairy cattle relate to lameness, or to other possible confounding factors such as parity or number of days in milk. In this cross-sectional study, ten lame and ten non-lame barn-housed dairy cows were classified through mobility scoring and subsequently tracked using a wireless local positioning system. Nearly 900,000 spatial locations were recorded in total, allowing a range of movement and space-use measures to be determined for each individual cow. Using linear models, we highlight where lameness, parity, and the number of days in milk have a significant effect on the observed space-use patterns. Non-lame cows spent more time, and had higher site fidelity (on a day-to-day basis they were more likely to revisit areas they had visited previously), in the feeding area. Non-lame cows also had a larger full range size within the barn. In contrast, lame cows spent more time, and had a higher site-fidelity, in the cubicle (resting) areas of the barn than non-lame cows. Higher parity cows were found to spend more time in the right-hand-side area of the barn, closer to the passageway to the milking parlour. The number of days in milk was found to positively affect the core range size, but with a negative interaction effect with lameness. Using a simple predictive model, we demonstrate how it is possible to accurately determine the lameness status of all individual cows within the study using only two observed space-use measures, the proportion of time spent in the feeding area and the full range size. Our findings suggest that differences in individual movement and space-use behaviour could be used as indicators of health status for automated monitoring within a Precision Livestock Farming approach, potentially leading to faster diagnosis and treatment, and improved animal welfare for dairy cattle and other managed animal species."
https://openalex.org/W2904781317,"Many elite sport organisations have introduced structured talent identification and development (TID) initiatives in youth sports to better facilitate elite sport performance. However, selection mechanisms for TID programmes (e.g., junior international team) are biased towards relatively older athletes and limited studies exist with Scandinavian contexts. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the relative age effect (RAE) in youth, junior and senior male and female international team selections among Norwegian handball players (n = 657). A Chi-square goodness-of-fit test assessed whether a skewed birthdate distribution occurred at the youth, junior and senior international team levels and odds-ratios were calculated for RAE distribution. Moreover, a Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess differences between the number of international youth, junior and senior level appearances by birth quartiles. Significant uneven birth date distributions were shown for youth (χ2(7) = female 40.383 and male 105.716, p <0.001) and junior (χ2(7) = female 27.427 and male 30.948, p <0.001) international players, favouring the relatively older player (odds-ratio of 1.9-8.3). At the senior level, no uneven distribution was identified. The comparison of the number of matches in each age category and the quartile of birth showed a difference in the women's youth category, where players in quartile 8 had a significantly lower number of appearances compared to quartile 1. The results form part of a growing body of knowledge about selection mechanisms in sport, which favours relatively older athletes within Norwegian Handball. Such findings are important for policy and practice for informing TID programmes for inclusive selection opportunities for all players."
https://openalex.org/W2905012492,"Dengue fever is known to be one of the most common arthropod-borne viral infectious diseases of public health importance. The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific with an estimated two fifths of the world's population being at risk. The notable endemic viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) found in West Africa, including yellow fever, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, dengue fever and until recently Ebola have been responsible for most outbreaks with fatal consequences. These VHFs usually produce unclear acute febrile illness, especially in the acute phase of infection. In this study we detected the presence of 2 different serotypes (DENV-2 and DENV-3) of Dengue virus in 4 sera of 150 patients clinically suspected of Ebola virus disease during the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa with the use of serological and molecular test assays. Sequence data was successfully generated for DENV-3 and phylogenetic analysis of the envelope gene showed that the DENV-3 sequences had close homology with DENV-3 sequences from Senegal and India. This study documents molecular evidence of an indigenous Dengue fever viral infection in Ghana and therefore necessitates the need to have an efficient surveillance system to rapidly detect and control the dissemination of the different serotypes in the population which has the potential to cause outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fevers."
https://openalex.org/W2904252159,"A series of laboratory experiments was conducted to better understand the behavior of grass carp eggs and larvae in moving water in order to develop and implement new strategies for control and prediction of their dispersal and drift at early life stages. Settling velocity and density of a representative sample of eggs were estimated, and three trials of flume experiments with different flow conditions were conducted with live eggs in a temperature-controlled setting with a mobile sediment bed. In these trials, egg and larval stages were continuously analyzed over periods of 80 hours; and eggs and larvae interactions with the flow and sediment bed were monitored and characterized qualitatively and quantitatively. Survival rates were quantified after each trial, highlighting physical causes for increased mortality. Detailed flow analysis was correlated to the observed drifting and swimming behavior of eggs and larvae, to estimate distributions across the water depth, as well as traveling and swimming speeds. Evidence of the influence of mean and turbulent flow in the suspension and transport of eggs are reported, and swimming patterns of larvae at different developmental stages are described. These findings support the development of new strategies for monitoring the spread of grass carp eggs and larvae in rivers, and provide new inputs to predict conditions favorable for spawning and hatching, allowing for mitigation measures at early life stages, which are critical to control their dispersal."
https://openalex.org/W2905148318,"Recent changes in institutional cyberinfrastructure and collections data storage methods have dramatically improved accessibility of specimen-based data through the use of digital databases and data aggregators. This analysis of digitized fish collections in the U.S. demonstrates how information from data aggregators, in this case iDigBio, can be extracted and analyzed. Data from U.S. institutional fish collections in iDigBio were explored through a strictly programmatic approach using the ridigbio package and fishfindR web application. iDigBio facilitates the aggregation of collections data on a purely voluntary fashion that requires collection staff to consent to sharing of their data. Not all collections are sharing their data with iDigBio, but the data harvested from 38 of the 143 known fish collections in the U.S. that are in iDigBio account for the majority of fish specimens housed in U.S. collections. In the 22 years since publication of the last survey providing information on these 38 collections, 1,219,168 specimen records (lots), 15,225,744 specimens, 3,192 primary types, and 32,868 records of secondary types have been added. This is an increase of 65.1% in the number of cataloged records and an increase of 56.1% in the number of specimens. In addition to providing specimen-based data for research, education, and various outreach activities, data that are accessible via data aggregators can be used to develop accurate, up-to-date reports of information on institutional collections. Such reports present collections data in an organized and accessible fashion and can guide targeted efforts by collections personnel to meet discipline-specific needs and make data more transparent to downstream users. Data from this survey will be updated and published regularly in a dynamic web application that will aid collections staff in communicating collections value while simultaneously giving stakeholders a way to explore collections holdings as they relate to the institutions in which they are housed. It is through this resource that collections will be able to leverage their data against those of similar collections to aid in the procurement of financial and institutional support."
https://openalex.org/W2950786811,"The study of biodiversity spatial patterns along ecological gradients can serve to elucidate factors shaping biological community structure and predict ecosystem responses to global change. Ant assemblages are particularly interesting as study cases, because ant species play a key role in many ecosystem processes and have frequently been identified as useful bioindicators.Here we analyzed the response of ant species richness and assemblage composition across elevational gradients in Mediterranean grasslands and subsequently tested whether these responses were stable spatially and temporally. We sampled ant assemblages in two years (2014, 2015) in two mountain ranges (Guadarrama, Serrota) in Central Spain, along an elevational gradient ranging from 685 to 2390 m a.s.l.Jackknife estimates of ant species richness ranged from three to 18.5 species and exhibited a hump-shaped relationship with elevation that peaked at mid-range values (1100-1400 m). This pattern was transferable temporally and spatially. Elevation was related to ant assemblage composition and facilitated separation of higher elevation assemblages (> 1700 m) from the remaining lower elevation species groups. Ant assemblages were nested; therefore species assemblages with a decreased number of species were a subset of the richer assemblages, although species turnover was more important than pure nestedness in all surveys. The degree of nestedness changed non-linearly as a cubic polynomial with elevation. These assembly patterns coincided more clearly over time than between the two study regions.We suggest double environmental stressors typical of Mediterranean mountains explained species richness patterns: drought at low elevations and cold temperatures at high elevations likely constrained richness at both extremes of elevational gradients. The fact that species turnover showed a dominant role over pure nestedness suggested current ant assemblages were context-dependent and highly vulnerable to global change, which threatens the conservation of present day native ant communities, particularly at high elevations."
https://openalex.org/W2905482164,"Convoluted nasal passages are an enigmatic hallmark of Ankylosauria. Previous research suggested that these convoluted nasal passages functioned as heat exchangers analogous to the respiratory turbinates of mammals and birds. We tested this hypothesis by performing a computational fluid dynamic analysis on the nasal passages of two ankylosaurs: Panoplosaurus mirus and Euoplocephalus tutus. Our models predicted that Panoplosaurus and Euoplocephalus would have required 833 and 1568 thermal calories, respectively, to warm a single breath of air by 20°C. Heat recovery during exhalation resulted in energy savings of 65% for Panoplosaurus and 84% for Euoplocephalus. Our results fell well within the range of values for heat and water savings observed in extant terrestrial amniotes. We further tested alternate airway reconstructions that removed nasal passage convolutions or reduced nasal vestibule length. Our results revealed that the extensive elaboration observed in the nasal vestibules of ankylosaurs was a viable alternative to respiratory turbinates with regards to air conditioning. Of the two dinosaurs tested, Euoplocephalus repeatedly exhibited a more efficient nasal passage than Panoplosaurus. We suggest that the higher heat loads associated with the larger body mass of Euoplocephalus necessitated these more efficient nasal passages. Our findings further indicate that the evolution of complicated airways in dinosaurs may have been driven by the thermal requirements of maintaining cerebral thermal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2904782604,"The success of biological control may depend on the control agent co-evolving with its target pest species, precluding the emergence of resistance that often undermines chemical control. However, recent evidence of a decline in attack rates of a sexual pest weevil by its asexual parasitoid suggests that evolutionary arms races may not prevent the emergence of resistance if the host and parasitoid do not have reproductive strategies that generate equal amounts of genetic variation. To understand how these asymmetries in reproductive strategies may drive the emergence of resistance, we combined life history data from two pest weevils and their parasitoids (one sexual and one asexual) in the New Zealand pastoral ecosystem, with a population dynamic model that allows the coevolution of hosts and parasitoids. We found that the ratio of the genetic variance of hosts to parasitoids was a key determinant of the emergence of resistance. Host resistance eventually occurred unless the parasitoids had considerably greater additive genetic variance than their host. The higher reproductive rate of asexual parasitoids did little to offset the cost of reduced additive genetic variance. The model predictions were congruent with long-term parasitism rates observed in the field for both of the pests considered (one with a sexual and one with an asexual parasitoid). We then explored the consequences of introducing two parasitoids with different reproductive strategies that attack the same sexual host. The model showed that the sexually reproducing parasitoid always out-competed the asexually reproducing one. Our study shows that any asymmetry in reproductive strategies is extremely important for predicting the long-term success of biological control agents. Fortunately, introduction of sexually reproducing individuals after an initial introduction of asexual strains may overcome the problems of host resistance. We conclude that evolution must be considered when evaluating the long-term outcomes of importation biological control."

https://openalex.org/W2905555279,"The aim of this study was to understand the perceptions of Brazilian citizens about the general conditions of animal welfare in the poultry, beef, and dairy supply chains. To reach this aim, an online survey was conducted. The analysis was based on descriptive statistics and three logistic regression models. Results of descriptive statistics showed that citizens in Brazil had mostly negative perceptions about the conditions of animal welfare in the poultry, beef, and dairy supply chains. Results of the logistic regression models showed that citizens with a background in agricultural/veterinary sciences, and citizens who reported a higher level of knowledge about poultry and dairy supply chains were more likely to perceive the general conditions of animal welfare in these two supply chains as being bad. Citizens who reported previous contact with poultry farms were also more likely to perceive the general conditions of animal welfare in the poultry supply chain as being bad. In addition, the perception that farmers are mainly focused on the economic aspect of farming and less on animal welfare, the perception that animals do not have a good quality of life while housed on farms, and the perception that animals are not adequately transported and slaughtered, negatively impact on perceptions about the general conditions of animal welfare in the poultry, beef, and dairy supply chains."
https://openalex.org/W2949488889,"The world´s largest network of protected areas—Natura 2000 (N2000)—has been implemented to protect Europe´s biodiversity. N2000 is built upon two cornerstones, the Birds Directive, which lists 691 bird species (plus one additional bird genus with no further classification) and the Habitats Directive, which lists next to a variety of species, 233 habitat types to be protected. There is evidence of the positive impact of the Directives on the EU´s biodiversity, although the overall improvement reported for species in favourable condition in the last assessment was low. However, most of the assessments are species focused, while habitats have received very little attention. Here we developed a generic workflow, which we exemplified for Germany, to assess the status of habitat coverage within the N2000 network combining information from publicly available data sources. Applying the workflow allows identification of gaps in habitat protection, followed by the prioritization of potential areas of high protection value using the conservation planning software Marxan. We found that, in Germany, N2000 covers all target habitats. However, common habitats were proportionally underrepresented relative to rare ones, which contrasts with studies focussing on the representation of species. Moreover, the German case study suggests that especially highly protected areas (i.e. covered by more than 90% with N2000 sites) build an excellent basis towards a cost-effective and efficient conservation network. Our workflow provides a generic approach to deal with the common problem of missing habitat distribution data outside of N2000 sites, information which is however crucial for managers to plan conservation actions appropriately across Europe. To avoid a biased representation of habitat types within N2000, our results underpin the importance of defining qualitative and quantitative conservation targets which will allow assesment of the trajectory of habitat protection in Europe as well as adjustment of the network accordingly—a future necessity in the light of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2903611867,"Since the 1980s, the distribution range of the southern right whale (Eubalaena australis) in Argentina was mostly located in the winter calving grounds around Península Valdés. After the international moratorium that forbade the commercial hunting, southern right whales have shown signs of recovery during the last few decades. Nowadays, it is thought that the species is experiencing a density-dependent process while expanding its distribution range in Patagonia. From 2007 to 2016, data on right whale distribution, group composition and relative abundance were collected in Golfo San Matías, Patagonia through aerial surveys. Generalized linear models with a negative binomial error distribution were used to determine the population trend of right whales in this area. In addition, the group composition and the relative abundance of right whales among the northern Patagonian gulfs were compared. Finally, a literature review was conducted to assess the historical presence of right whales in Golfo San Matías, revealing the presence of right whales in Golfo San Matías during and after the commercial exploitation. During aerial surveys (2007-2016), right whales were observed from August to October in the area, with a peak in late August-early September. Our results suggested a geographic distribution change with a regular use of the northwest coast of the gulf in recent years and a positive trend in the population growth rate inside Golfo San Matías. This area was dominated by unaccompanied whales (solitary individuals and breeding groups) as opposed to Península Valdés where the dominant group type was the mother calf pairs. Therefore, Golfo San Matías appears to be important for socializing and mating but not as a nursery ground. In addition, the density of whales was four times greater in the gulfs of Península Valdés. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the recovery of this species in Patagonia, Argentina and should be considered for the management measures for right whales in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2978408894,"Functional trait theory provides a mechanistic framework to understand change in community composition and community assembly through time and space. Despite this, trait-based approaches have seldom been used in ecological restoration. Succession theory predicts that habitat complexity and resource availability will increase with restoration time, leading to increased functional dissimilarity among coexisting species. However, in the case of tidal marsh restoration, it is not clear whether reestablishing the harsh abiotic conditions typical of estuaries will initiate successional trajectories. We investigated monotonic changes in the functional structure of fish communities and shifts in assembly mechanisms, with tidal restoration time. A five-level gradient of ‘intertidal habitat naturalness’ was constructed from a set of artificialized (dyked), restored (with different ages) and natural intertidal sites, and used as a surrogate for restoration progress. The fish ecophases were described using ten functional traits related to food acquisition and swimming ability. The trends in six functional dimensions (identity, richness, evenness, dispersion, originality and specialization) were investigated along the naturalness gradient. Consistenly with succession theory, functional specialization, dispersion and, less markedly, richness increased with intertidal naturalness meaning that restored and natural intertidal habitats supplied fish with specific foraging and dwelling conditions absent from dyked marshes. Community assembly patterns varied with respect to traits and differed at both ends of the naturalness gradient. Dyked marshes were more affected by trait convergence possibly due to limiting resources. Environmental filtering was detected all along the naturalness gradient although the traits affected varied depending on the naturalness level of habitats. Environmental filtering tended to decrease in restored and natural intertidal habitats. Increased naturalness restored the attractivity of benthic habitats as feeding or settling grounds, promoted shelter-seeking vs. free-swimming strategists and favoured ecophases with carnivorous diets, feeding on microinvertebrates and benthic low-mobility macroinvertebrates. Approaches based on functional trait diversity have the potential to question and refine the theoretical frame of ecological restoration and to assist managers in their efforts to restore tidal wetlands."
https://openalex.org/W2903800743,"Background Identifying key interventions to increase exclusive breastfeeding duration has been a challenge. Pacifier use has been associated with exclusive breastfeeding discontinuation in Brazil. However, the proportion of the improvement in exclusive breastfeeding duration attributable to pacifier use remains unknown. Research aim Quantify the proportion of increases in exclusive breastfeeding prevalence that can be attributed to reduced pacifier use over time. Methods Secondary data analyses of two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys conducted in States’ capitals in 1999 and in 2008 (N = 42,395 Brazilian infants under 6 months of age). We estimated the fraction of exclusive breastfeeding prevalence improvements that could be attributed to pacifier use based on multilevel regression analysis. Results From 1999 to 2008, there was an increase of 15.2 percentage points in exclusive breastfeeding prevalence and a decrease of approximately 17 percentage points in the prevalence of pacifier use among infants under 6 months. Reduction in pacifier use explained an increase in 5.5 percentage points’ exclusive breastfeeding rates. If pacifier use were to decrease from 41.6% (prevalence in 2008) to 14% (as found in New Zealand), there would be an expected additional increase in exclusive breastfeeding of approximately 12 percentage points. Conclusions About one-third of the improvements in EBF prevalence observed in Brazil over a decade can be attributed to the corresponding decline in pacifier use."
https://openalex.org/W2904999144,"In the past two decades, avian influenzas have posed an increasing international threat to human and livestock health. In particular, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has spread across Asia, Africa, and Europe, leading to the deaths of millions of poultry and hundreds of people. The two main means of international spread are through migratory birds and the live poultry trade. We focus on the role played by the live poultry trade in the spread of H5N1 across three regions widely infected by the disease, which also correspond to three major trade blocs: the European Union (EU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Across all three regions, we found per-capita GDP (a proxy for modernization, general biosecurity, and value-at-risk) to be risk reducing. A more specific biosecurity measure–general surveillance–was also found to be mitigating at the all-regions level. However, there were important inter-regional differences. For the EU and ASEAN, intra-bloc live poultry imports were risk reducing while extra-bloc imports were risk increasing; for ECOWAS the reverse was true. This is likely due to the fact that while the EU and ASEAN have long-standing biosecurity standards and stringent enforcement (pursuant to the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures), ECOWAS suffered from a lack of uniform standards and lax enforcement."
https://openalex.org/W2904825892,"Background The United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals encompass lifelong learning from birth to youth to adulthood (Goal 4) and economic opportunities for young people (Goal 8). The targets include improving access to quality early childhood care and education (ECCE) as well as learning and training opportunities for adolescents and youth. Cross-generational models for young children and youth may offer opportunities to address the interconnections between goals and targets for the next generation. We investigated whether an ECCE programme for young children (3.5–6.5 years) delivered by female youth (18–24 years) in rural Pakistan would be effective on children’s school readiness. Methods In partnership with the National Commission for Human Development in Pakistan, we implemented the ‘Youth Leaders for Early Childhood Assuring Children are Prepared for School’ (LEAPS) programme to train female youth to deliver ECCE. The effectiveness of the LEAPS programme on children’s school readiness was evaluated in a cluster-randomised controlled trial. We randomly allocated five clusters (villages) to receive the intervention (n = 170 children) and five clusters to control (n = 170 children). Children’s school readiness was assessed after nine months of intervention exposure using the International Development and Early Learning Assessment tool. Analyses was by intention-to-treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02645162. Findings At endline, the intervention group had significantly higher school readiness scores (n = 166, mean percentage score 59.4, 95% CI 52.7 to 66.2) compared with the control group (n = 168, mean percentage score 45.5, 95% CI 38.8 to 52.3). The effect size (Cohen’s d) was 0.3. Conclusion Trained female youth delivered an ECCE programme that was effective in benefitting young children’s school readiness. The cross-generational model is a promising approach to support early child development; however, further evaluation of the model is needed to assess the specific benefits to youth including their skills and economic development."
https://openalex.org/W2904423478,"Chemical cues are thought to play an important role in mate identification in the solitary giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). The goal of this study was to detect and identify volatile compounds present in the enclosure air of captive giant pandas. We hypothesized that a subset of compounds produced from breeding animals would be detected in environmental samples because highly volatile chemicals are likely to facilitate mate detection. Samples were collected from the enclosures of 8 giant pandas (n = 4 male, n = 4 female) during the Mar-June breeding season and the Aug-Jan non-breeding period from 2012-2015. Volatile compounds were captured by securing a solid phase micro extraction fiber approximately 3 meters above the ground within a panda enclosure for 6-12 hours. Compounds adsorbed onto the SPME fibers were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Thirty-three compounds were detected in at least 10% of all samples within individual and season and across all subjects within each season. Aromatic compounds made up 27.3% of the enclosure volatile profile, while 21.2% was made of cyclic aliphatic compounds and 51.5% of the enclosure profile was comprised of acyclic aliphatic compounds. Three compounds were likely to be present in male enclosures regardless of season, while Undecane, 4-methyl had a significant (p<0.05) predicted probability of being present in female enclosures. 3,3'-(1,1-Ethanediyl)bis(1H-indole) had a significant (p<0.05) probability of occurrence in male enclosures during the breeding season. Given the prevalence of these compounds, we suspect that these chemicals are important in giant panda communication. This novel sampling technique can detect volatile compounds produced by captive species and also may be a useful tool for detecting pheromones in free-ranging individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2904531484,"That great ape endocranial shape development persists into adolescence indicates that the splanchnocranium succeeds brain growth in driving endocranial development. However, the extent of this splanchnocranial influence is unknown. We applied two-block partial least squares analyses of Procrustes shape variables on an ontogenetic series of great ape crania to explore the covariation of the endocranium (the internal braincase) and splanchnocranium (face, or viscerocranium). We hypothesized that a transition between brain growth and splanchnocranial development in the establishment of final endocranial form would be manifest as a change in the pattern of shape covariation between early and adolescent ontogeny. Our results revealed a strong pattern of covariation between endocranium and splanchnocranium, indicating that chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans share a common tempo and mode of morphological integration from the eruption of the deciduous dentition onwards to adulthood: a reflection of elongating endocranial shape and continuing splanchnocranial prognathism. Within this overarching pattern, we noted that species variation exists in magnitude and direction, and that the covariation between the splanchnocranium and endocranium is somewhat weaker in early infancy compared to successive age groups. When correcting our covariation analyses for allometry, we found that an ontogenetic signal remains, signifying that allometric variation alone is insufficient to account for all endocranial-splanchnocranial developmental integration. Finally, we assessed the influence of the cranial base, which acts as the interface between the face and endocranium, on the shape of the vault using thin-plate spline warping. We found that not all splanchnocranial shape changes during development are tightly integrated with endocranial shape. This suggests that while the developmental expansion of the brain is the main driver of endocranial shape during early ontogeny, endocranial development from infancy onwards is moulded by the splanchnocranium in conjunction with the neurocranium."
https://openalex.org/W2904542887,"In life cycle assessment (LCA), performing Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) using fully dependent sampling typically involves repeated inversion of a technology matrix for a sufficiently large number of times. As the dimension of technology matrices for life cycle inventory (LCI) databases grows, MCS using fully dependent sampling is becoming a computational challenge. In our previous work, we pre-calculated the distribution functions of the entire LCI flows in the ecoinvent ver. 3.1 database to help reduce the computation time of running fully dependent sampling by individual LCA practitioners. However, it remains as a question whether the additional errors due to the use of pre-calculated uncertainty values are large enough to alter the conclusion of a comparative study, and, if so, what is the odds of such cases. In this study, we empirically tested the probability of altering the conclusion of a comparative LCA due to the use of pre-calculated uncertainty values. We sampled 10,000 random pairs of elementary flows of ecoinvent LCIs (ai and bi) and ran MCSs (1) using pre-calculated uncertainty values and (2) using fully dependent sampling. We analyzed the distribution of the differences between ai and bi (i.e., ai−bi) of each run, and quantified the probability of reversing (e.g., ai > bi became ai < bi) or moderating the conclusion (e.g., ai > bi became ai ≈ bi). In order to better replicate the situation under a comparative LCA setting, we also sampled 10,000 random pairs of elementary flows from the processes that produce electricity, and repeated the same procedure. The results show that no LCIs derived using pre-calculated uncertainty values constitute large enough differences from those using fully dependent sampling to reverse the conclusion. However, in 5.3% of the cases, the conclusion from one approach is moderated under the other approach or vice versa. When elementary flow pairs are sampled only from the electricity-producing processes, the probability of moderating the conclusions increases to 10.5%, while that of reversing the conclusions remains nil. As the number of unit processes in LCI databases increases, running full MCSs in a PC-environment will continue to be a challenge, which may lead some LCA practitioners to avoid uncertainty analysis altogether. Our results indicate that pre-calculated distributions for LCIs can be used as a proxy for comparative LCA studies in the absence of adequate computational resources for full MCS. Depending on the goal and scope of the study, LCA practitioners should consider using pre-calculated distributions if the benefits of doing so outweighs the associated risks of altering the conclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2905358223,"Preventive HIV-1 vaccine strategies rely on the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) responses, but their induction in vivo by vaccination remains challenging. Considering that the ability of an epitope to elicit effective humoral immunity depends on its exposure on the virion, we have used a reverse genetics approach to select variants from an HIV-1 AC10_29 randomly mutated envelope library that showed increased affinity for a selected bNAb (4E10 bNAb targeting the HIV-1 MPER region). Isolated envelope sequences were analyzed by deep-sequencing showing a small number of dominant changes, including the loss of four potential N-linked glycosylation sites and disruption of the V1/V2 loop. Accordingly, the dominant variant (LR1-C1), showed not only increased affinity for MPER bNAbs 4E10 and 2F5, but also higher affinity for an additional antibody targeting the V3 loop (447-52D) that could be a consequence of an open conformation tier 1-like Env. Furthermore, the amino acids specific for the selected variant are associated with an increased sensitivity for 4E10 and 2F5 antibodies. In vivo studies showed that sera from mice immunized with LR1-C1 viruses possessed an improved neutralizing activity compared to the wild-type AC10_29 env. While Virus Like Particles (VLPs) carrying this envelope were unable to induce detectable neutralizing activity in immunized rabbits, one animal showed antibody response to the 4E10-proximal region. Our data establish a novel approach that has the potential to yield HIV envelope immunogen sequences that direct antibody responses to specific envelope regions."
https://openalex.org/W2905519789,"Boswellia sacra, an endemic tree to Oman, is exposed to man-made incisions for commercial level frankincense production, whereas unsustainable harvesting may lead to population decline. In this case, assessment of endogenous phytohormones (gibberellic acid (GA), indole-acetic acid (IAA), salicylic acid (SA) and kinetin) can help to understand population health and growth dynamics. Hence, it was aimed to devise a robust method using Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) coupled with multivariate methods for phytohormone analysis of thirteen different populations of B. sacra. NIRS data was recorded in absorption mode (10000–4000 cm-1) to build partial least squares regression model (calibration set 70%). Model was externally cross validated (30%) as a test set to check their prediction ability before the application to quantify the unknown amount of phytohormones in thirteen different populations of B. sacra. The results showed that phytohormonal contents varied significantly, showing a trend of SA>GA/IAA>kinetin across different populations. SA and GA contents were significantly higher in Pop13 (Hasik), followed by Pop2 (Dowkah)–an extreme end of B. sacra tree cover in Dhofar region. A similar trend in the concentration of phytohormones was found when the samples from 13 populations were subjected to advance liquid chromatography mass spectrophotometer and gas chromatograph with selected ion monitor analysis. The current analysis provides alternative tool to assess plant health, which could be important to in situ propagation of tree population as well as monitoring tree population growth dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2905585734,"This community study evaluates complex interactions between macro and micro determinants of oral health in a local Indigenous population based on a theoretical framework of demographic, economic, and healthcare transformation over the last half century. The study population included all residents of eight Xavante villages in Central Brazil. Our hypothetical model posited multiple direct and indirect associations between dental caries and village groups with differentiated territorial and oral care histories, as well as household socioeconomic indicators and food acquisition patterns, individual sociodemographic characteristics, use of dental health services, and oral hygiene practices. Structural equation modelling methods were used to evaluate direct and indirect associations linking exogenous factors and dental caries. Results include 18 direct and 14 indirect statistically significant pathways between determinant variables and dental caries. Significant links with dental caries were shown for socioeconomic indicators, oral healthcare variables, household food acquisition patterns, sex, and age. These findings suggest that the oral health of Xavante residents in the villages studied is associated with determinant factors of different epidemiological and historical scales. The specific historical frame of territorial circumscription and demographic crisis followed by rapid population increase since the 1970s should be considered a cause-of-cause determinant of the economic, healthcare, and sociodemographic profile contributing to oral health among the Xavante. Considering the limitations of cross-sectional studies, our findings underline the importance for oral health determination of historical currents affecting minority ethnic groups within national societies."
https://openalex.org/W2905417613,"Background Nucleic acid testing (NAT) for virus detection during blood screening has helped to prevent transfusion-transmitted infections worldwide. In northern Brazil, NAT was implemented in 2012 for HIV and HCV and more recently, in January 2015, the screening for HBV was included and currently used concomitant with serological tests (HBsAg and anti-HBc). This study aims to evaluate the prevalence and the incidence of HBV infection among voluntary blood donors at ten regional blood centers of HEMOPA Foundation in Pará state and to compare the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted HBV infection before and after the Brazilian HBV-NAT implementation. Methods The prevalence (restricted to first time donors- FT) and seroconversion rate (restricted to repeat donors- RP) of HBV were calculated based on rates of confirmed positive samples. Residual risk was based on the incidence and window period (WP) model described by Schreiber and coauthors. Logistic and Poisson regression were used in the statistical analysis by SPSS v20.0. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results HBV prevalence in the periods before and after the implementation of HBV-NAT were 247 and 251 per 100,000 donations, respectively. Seroconversion rates were 114 and 122 per 100,000 donations in the two periods, respectively. The residual risk (RR) for HBV decreased significantly in the posterior period to the HBV-NAT implementation, when compared to RR before implementation, with a reduction of 1:144,92 to 1:294,11 donations (p <0,001). Conclusions The RR to HBV decreased after the implementation of HBV-NAT, increasing significantly the transfusional security in the North region of Brazil at HEMOPA Foundation."

It is used for the treatment of infections in livestock; such as gastrointestinal, and respiratory tract infections. During the current study, synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of immunomodulatory activities of derivatives of sulfamethazine (SMZ) (3–39) was carried out. These derivatives were synthesized by the reaction of sulfamethazine with a range of acid chlorides. All the compounds were characterized by using modern spectroscopic techniques, such as 1H-, and 13C-NMR, EI-MS, and HRFAB-MS. Compounds 3–10, 14, and 15 were identified as new compounds. Immunomodulatory effect of compounds 3–39 on different parameters of innate immune response was evaluated, including the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) from human whole blood and isolated polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), nitric oxide (NO), and pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α. All the new compounds, except 14 and 15, showed a significant anti-inflammatory activity.

https://openalex.org/W2904369395,"Asthma exacerbations cause lung hyperinflation, elevation in load to inspiratory muscles, and decreased breathing capacity that, in severe cases, may lead to inspiratory muscle fatigue and respiratory failure. Hyperinflation has been attributed to a passive mechanical origin; a respiratory system time-constant too long for full exhalation. However, because the increase in volume is also concurrent with activation of inspiratory muscles during exhalation it is unclear whether hyperinflation in broncho-constriction is a passive phenomenon or is actively controlled to avoid airway closure.Using CT scanning, we measured the distensibility of individual segmental airways relative to that of their surrounding parenchyma in seven subjects with asthma and nine healthy controls. With this data we tested whether the elevation of lung volume measured after methacholine (MCh) provocation was associated with airway narrowing, or to the volume required to preventing airway closure. We also tested whether the reduction in FVC post-MCh could be attributed to gas trapped behind closed segmental airways.The changes in lung volume by MCh in subjects with and without asthma were inversely associated with their reduction in average airway lumen. This finding would be inconsistent with hyperinflation by passive elevation of airway resistance. In contrast, the change in volume of each subject was associated with the lung volume estimated to cause the closure of the least stable segmental airway of his/her lungs. In addition, the measured drop in FVC post MCh was associated with the estimated volume of gas trapped behind closed segmental airways at RV.Our data supports the concept that hyperinflation caused by MCh-induced bronchoconstriction is the result of an actively controlled process where parenchymal distending forces on airways are increased to counteract their closure. To our knowledge, this is the first imaging-based study that associates inter-subject differences in whole lung behavior with the interdependence between individual airways and their surrounding parenchyma."

We aimed to evaluate the medium-term sustainability of a PMQP implemented at intensive care units (ICUs).Two surveys, the first in 2012, immediately after introduction of the PMQP, and the second in 2015, were carried out amongst patients, physicians and nurses. Demographic parameters of all participants were assessed. Patients were asked after their pain levels during ICU stay. Staff members answered a questionnaire regarding familiarity with standards and processes of PMQP and self-perception of their knowledge as well as contentment with interdisciplinary communication.In total (2012/2015), 267 (125/142) patients, 113 (65/48) physicians and 510 (264/246) members of the nursing staff participated. Minimum and maximum pain levels of patients did not differ between both surveys. Patients' tolerance of pain 24 hours before the survey was better (p = 0.023), and vomiting occurred less often (p = 0.037) in 2015. Physicians' and nurses' contentment with the own knowledge about pharmacological pain treatment had increased from 2012 to 2015 (p = 0.002 and 0.004). Satisfaction with communication between nurses and physicians was better in 2015 (p<0.001 and p = 0.002). Familiarity with PMQP standards and processes remained stable in both collectives.The implementation of our PMQP achieved a high standard of care, guarantying a high patient and staff member satisfaction. Continuous education, ongoing training, regular updates and implementation of feedback-loops ensure continuity, in some parameters even an increase in knowledge and competencies. This is mirrored in high patient and staff member satisfaction."

In this study, we unexpectedly discovered a method to enhance CLG with a VEGF inhibitor, soluble VEGFR1. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 male mice underwent left pneumonectomy, followed by daily intraperitoneal (ip) injection of either saline (control) or 20 μg/kg of VEGFR1-Fc. On post-operative day (POD) 4, mice underwent pulmonary function tests (PFT) and lungs were harvested for volume measurement and analyses of the VEGF signaling pathway. To investigate the role of hypoxia in mediating the effects of VEGFR1, experiments were repeated with concurrent administration of PT-2385, an inhibitor of hypoxia-induced factor (HIF)2α, via orogastric gavage at 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for 4 days. We found that VEGFR1-treated mice had increased total lung capacity (P = 0.006), pulmonary compliance (P = 0.03), and post-euthanasia lung volume (P = 0.049) compared to control mice. VEGFR1 treatment increased pulmonary levels of VEGF (P = 0.008) and VEGFR2 (P = 0.01). It also stimulated endothelial proliferation (P < 0.0001) and enhanced pulmonary surfactant production (P = 0.03). The addition of PT-2385 abolished the increase in lung volume and endothelial proliferation in response to VEGFR1. By paradoxically stimulating angiogenesis and enhancing lung growth, VEGFR1 could represent a new treatment strategy for neonatal lung diseases characterized by dysfunction of the HIF-VEGF pathway."

A potential blood-based biomarker indicative of a chronic inflammatory state is N-Terminal Pro C-Type Natriuretic Peptide (NTproCNP). We aim to investigate associations between NTproCNP and ageing-related impairments in cardiovascular function. Community-based participants underwent same-day assessment of cardiovascular function and circulating profiles of plasma NTproCNP. Associations between cardiovascular and biomarker profiles were studied in adjusted models including standard covariates. We studied 93 participants (mean age 73 ± 5.3 years, 36 women), of whom 55 (59%) had impaired myocardial relaxation (ratio of peak velocity flow in early diastole E (m/s) to peak velocity flow in late diastole by atrial contraction A (m/s) <0.84). Participants with impaired myocardial relaxation were also found to have lower peak early phase filling velocity (0.6 ± 0.1 vs 0.7 ± 0.1, p < 0.0001) and higher peak atrial phase filling velocity (0.9 ± 0.1 vs 0.7 ± 0.1, p < 0.0001). NTproCNP levelswere significantly lower among participants with impaired myocardial relaxation (16.4% vs 39.5% with NTproCNP ≥ 19, p = 0.012). After multivariable adjustments, NTproCNP was independently associated with impaired myocardial relaxation (OR 2.99, 95%CI 1.12-8.01, p = 0.029). Community elderly adults with myocardial ageing have lower NTproCNP levels compared to those with preserved myocardial function. Given that impaired myocardial relaxation probably represents early changes within the myocardium with ageing, NTproCNP may be useful as an 'upstream' biomarker useful for charting myocardial ageing."

Results of the TB prevalence survey in Uganda found high TB prevalence (570/100,000) in people over 65. We focused on treatment outcomes in the elderly to understand this epidemic better. We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from TB facility registers in Kampala City for the period 2014-2015. We analyzed the 2014-15 cohort with respect to age, sex, disease class, patients' human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and directly observed therapy (DOT) status, type of facility, and treatment outcomes and compared findings in the elderly (≥60) and younger (<60) age groups. Of 15,429 records, 3.3% (514/15,429) were for elderly patients. The treatment success rate (TSR) among elderly TB patients (68.3%) was lower than that of the non-elderly (80.9%) and the overall TSR 80.5%, (12,417/15,429) in Kampala. Although the elderly were less likely to test positive for HIV than the young (AOR 0.39; 95% CI 0.33-0.48, p<0.001), they had a two-fold higher risk of unfavorable treatment outcomes (AOR 2.14; CI 1.84-2.72, p<0.001) and were more likely to die while on treatment (AOR 1.86; CI 1.27-2.73; p = 0.001). However, there was no statistically significantly difference between treatment outcomes among HIV-positive and HIV-negative elderly TB patients. Compared to the younger TB patients, elderly TB patients have markedly poorer treatment outcomes, although TB/HIV co-infection rates in this age group are lower."
https://openalex.org/W2903679973,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia among adults. Despite the proven advantages in primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with AF, oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy is still underused in many countries. In this study, we investigated the incidence of AF-related ischemic stroke over the past decade in South Korea and trends of preventive antithrombotic therapy use before stroke in a nationwide cohort.The data source for this study was a nationwide sample cohort comprising 1,025,340 individuals that was established by the nationwide health insurance system in 2002. A total of 10,215 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) were selected from the cohort between 2004 and 2013. AF was identified in 1,662 patients, and 979 patients had preexisting AF before AIS. The annual proportion of patients with AIS with AF gradually increased from 13.4% to 22.6% over the study period (p for trends <0.001). Only 14.0% of patients with high risk AF were receiving OAC before the stroke, and this proportion remained relatively constant during the study period. However, the proportion of patients treated with antiplatelet agents had increased from 18.8% in 2004 to 45.3% in 2013, while that of patients receiving no antithrombotic agent decreased from 64.6% in 2004 to 43.9% in 2013. As a limitation, no information was available about non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, because they were widely used since late 2014 in Korea.The number of patients with AIS and AF has steadily increased over the last 10 years in Korea. However, a small portion of patients with AF were receiving OAC therapy before the stroke and about half of the patients did not receive any antithrombotic medication. Our study demonstrates that there is huge gap between clinical practice and treatment guidelines for patients with AF in Korea."
https://openalex.org/W2904803293,"To date, few optical imaging systems are available in clinical practice to perform noninvasive measurements transcutaneously. Instead, functional imaging is performed using ionizing radiation or intense magnetic fields in most cases. The applicability of fluorescence imaging (e.g., for the detection of fluorescently labeled objects, such as tumors) is limited due to the restricted tissue penetration of light and the required long exposure time. Thus, the development of highly sensitive and easily manageable instruments is necessary to broaden the utility of optical imaging. To advance these developments, an improved fluorescence imaging system was designed in this study that operates on the principle of noncontact laser-induced fluorescence and enables the detection of fluorescence from deeper tissue layers as well as real-time imaging. The high performance of the developed optical laser scanner results from the combination of specific point illumination, an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) detector with a novel light trap, and a filtering strategy. The suitability of the laser scanner was demonstrated in two representative applications and an in vivo evaluation. In addition, a comparison with a planar imaging system was performed. The results show that the exposure time with the developed laser scanner can be reduced to a few milliseconds during measurements with a penetration depth of up to 32 mm. Due to these short exposure times, real-time fluorescence imaging can be easily achieved. The ability to measure fluorescence from deep tissue layers enables clinically relevant applications, such as the detection of fluorescently labeled malignant tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2904810390,"Landscape solar energy is a significant environmental driver, yet it remains complicated to model well. Several solar radiation models simplify the complexity of light by estimating it at discrete point locations or by averaging values over larger areas. These modeling approaches may be useful in certain cases, but they are unable to provide spatially distributed and temporally dynamic representations of solar energy across entire landscapes. We created a landscape-scale ground-level shade and solar energy model called Penumbra to address this deficiency. Penumbra simulates spatially distributed ground-level shade and incident solar energy at user-defined timescales by modeling local and distant topographic shading and vegetative shading. Spatially resolved inputs of a digital elevation model, a normalized digital surface model, and landscape object transmittance are used to estimate spatial variations in solar energy at user-defined temporal timesteps. The research goals for Penumbra included: 1) simulations of spatiotemporal variations of shade and solar energy caused by both objects and topographic features, 2) minimal user burden and parameterization, 3) flexible user defined temporal parameters, and 4) flexible external model coupling. We test Penumbra’s predictive skill by comparing the model’s predictions with monitored open and forested sites, and achieve calibrated mean errors ranging from -17.3 to 148.1 μmoles/m2/s. Penumbra is a dynamic model that can produce spatial and temporal representations of shade percentage and ground-level solar energy. Outputs from Penumbra can be used with other ecological models to better understand the health and resilience of aquatic, near stream terrestrial, and upland ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2963359643,"Recent genetic studies and whole-genome sequencing projects have greatly improved our understanding of human variation and clinically actionable genetic information. Smaller ethnic populations, however, remain underrepresented in both individual and large-scale sequencing efforts and hence present an opportunity to discover new variants of biomedical and demographic significance. This report describes the sequencing and analysis of a genome obtained from an individual of Serbian origin, introducing tens of thousands of previously unknown variants to the currently available pool. Ancestry analysis places this individual in close proximity to Central and Eastern European populations; i.e., closest to Croatian, Bulgarian and Hungarian individuals and, in terms of other Europeans, furthest from Ashkenazi Jewish, Spanish, Sicilian and Baltic individuals. Our analysis confirmed gene flow between Neanderthal and ancestral pan-European populations, with similar contributions to the Serbian genome as those observed in other European groups. Finally, to assess the burden of potentially disease-causing/clinically relevant variation in the sequenced genome, we utilized manually curated genotype-phenotype association databases and variant-effect predictors. We identified several variants that have previously been associated with severe early-onset disease that is not evident in the proband, as well as putatively impactful variants that could yet prove to be clinically relevant to the proband over the next decades. The presence of numerous private and low-frequency variants, along with the observed and predicted disease-causing mutations in this genome, exemplify some of the global challenges of genome interpretation, especially in the context of under-studied ethnic groups."
https://openalex.org/W2903702046,"Purpose To investigate the internal exposure of nuclear medicine practitioners in South Korea. Methods This study selected nuclear medicine practitioners among domestic hospitals and quantitatively measured their degree of internal exposure to radioisotopes, and conducted a dose assessment based on the results. For the dose assessment, 35 nuclear medicine practitioners at seven large hospitals were selected as the measurement subjects, and the measurements were obtained using the thyroid count, total body count, and a urine sample analysis. The internal exposure was measured once every two weeks, and measurements were obtained three to 15 times according to the practitioners. Results As a result of measuring and analyzing the radionuclides with urine samples, one or more detections above the minimum detectable activity (MDA) was identified in 52 (15%) among all 340 cases for 14 of the practitioners (43%). The committed effective doses were evaluated as have a distribution of zero to 5.4 mSv, and were mostly 1 mSv or less. There were four practitioners exceeding 1 mSv based on the whole-body measurements, whose results from a urine sample analysis and thyroid monitoring all showed exposure of 1 mSv or less. All of the practitioners participated directly in the distribution and handling of radioactive sources, and none of the nurses exceeded 1 mSv. Furthermore, it was noteworthy that, among medical assistants who do not directly handle radioisotopes and are mainly involved in the transport of contaminated patients, there was one person who exceeded the whole-body measurement standard of 1 mSv. Conclusions The committed effective dose of most nuclear medicine practitioners who participated in the survey was lower than 1 mSv. However, because the possibility of overexposure under special circumstances cannot be completely excluded, new strict radiation protection rules on the handling of open-source radioisotopes in hospitals are required for non-handling workers."
https://openalex.org/W2904940847,"The genomic architecture of barriers to gene exchange during the speciation process is poorly understood. The genomic islands model suggests that loci associated with barriers to gene exchange prevent introgression of nearby genomic regions via linkage disequilibrium. But few analyses of the actual genomic location of non-introgressing loci in closely related species exist. In a previous study Maroja et al. showed that in the hybridizing field crickets, Gryllus firmus and G. pennsylvanicus, 50 non-introgressing loci are localized on two autosomal regions and the X chromosome, but they were not able to map the loci along the X chromosome because they used a male informative cross. Here, we localize the introgressing and non-introgressing loci on the X chromosome, and reveal that all X-linked non-introgressing loci are restricted to a 50-cM region with 10 of these loci mapped to a single location. We discuss the implications of this finding to speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2905344271,"Smooth septum interatrial septum, patent foramen ovale (PFO) channel and atrial septal pouches (SPs) are commonly described variants in humans. Recent discoveries on the clinical significance of left-sided SP may encourage the creation of new strategies and devices for the management of SPs. However, these strategies may first be tested in the ovine model before implementation in humans. Unfortunately, little is known about the presence of SPs in ovine. In this study a total of 60 ovine (Ovis aries) hearts were examined. The interatrial septum morphology was assessed and the PFO channel and SPs were measured. The most commonly occurring variant were PFO channels (25.0%) with channel lengths of 5.4±2.3 mm. Smooth septums were observed in 18.3% of hearts. In the remaining cases, septums had a left septal ridge (15.0%), left SP (11.7%), left septal bridge (10.0%), right SP (10.0%), or had both a right SP and left septal ridge (10.0%). No double SPs were observed. The mean right SP depth was 3.4 ± 1.2 mm, and its mean ostium width and height were 7.9±1.8 mm and 2.8±1.0, respectively. For the left SP, the mean depth was 6.0±1.7mm, the ostium width was 7.9±2.4mm, and the ostium height was 4.1±1.6mm (range: 2.3–6.4mm). In conclusion the interatrial septum of ovine hearts exhibit morphologies that are more similar to humans than they are to swine, which should be taken into account during experimental studies. The presence of a left SP in sheep hearts make ovine models a promising alternative to the human heart for developing left-sided SP management devices and techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2905262263,"Background Medical schools aim to contribute to a pool of doctors who are ready for a future practice that will be ever-changing requiring collaboration skills and lifelong learning. They adapt their curricula and selection procedures to fulfil this responsibility. This study aims to determine whether two different selection procedures in one medical school, both matching the key characteristics of the subsequent curricula (one traditional, knowledge-based, and one recently designed for self directed learning and focusing on practice), select students with different personality traits as a side-effect. This perspective was chosen as personality has been related to the CanMeds competencies, innovation capacities, medical school performance and medical professional success. Methods A total of 621 students admitted through the new or the traditional selection procedure were invited to complete a Big Five Inventory questionnaire at the start of their Bachelor’s programme. Using ANCOVA, we compared Big Five traits of students admitted through the new selection procedure (n = 196) and the traditional selection procedure (n = 425). Results The group of students admitted through the procedure matching the newly designed curriculum had a lower mean score on neuroticism (p < .01) and higher mean scores on conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and openness (p < .001) than the other group. Conclusions The findings of the current study indicate that the medical school population is influenced in terms of personality traits as a side-effect of a changing selection procedure. We recommend studying this mechanism and its implications further and using it more consciously in selection procedure design."
