https://openalex.org/W2000674771,"Groundwater is a primary source of fresh water in many parts of the world. Some regions are becoming overly dependent on it, consuming groundwater faster than it is naturally replenished and causing water tables to decline unremittingly. Indirect evidence suggests that this is the case in northwest India, but there has been no regional assessment of the rate of groundwater depletion. Here we use terrestrial water storage-change observations from the NASA Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites and simulated soil-water variations from a data-integrating hydrological modelling system to show that groundwater is being depleted at a mean rate of 4.0 +/- 1.0 cm yr(-1) equivalent height of water (17.7 +/- 4.5 km(3) yr(-1)) over the Indian states of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana (including Delhi). During our study period of August 2002 to October 2008, groundwater depletion was equivalent to a net loss of 109 km(3) of water, which is double the capacity of India's largest surface-water reservoir. Annual rainfall was close to normal throughout the period and we demonstrate that the other terrestrial water storage components (soil moisture, surface waters, snow, glaciers and biomass) did not contribute significantly to the observed decline in total water levels. Although our observational record is brief, the available evidence suggests that unsustainable consumption of groundwater for irrigation and other anthropogenic uses is likely to be the cause. If measures are not taken soon to ensure sustainable groundwater usage, the consequences for the 114,000,000 residents of the region may include a reduction of agricultural output and shortages of potable water, leading to extensive socioeconomic stresses."

https://openalex.org/W2074669819,"Background Of the putative psychopathological endophenotypes in major depressive disorder (MDD), the anhedonic subtype is particularly well supported. Anhedonia is generally assumed to reflect aberrant motivation and reward responsivity. However, research has been limited by a lack of objective measures of reward motivation. We present the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT or “effort”), a novel behavioral paradigm as a means of exploring effort-based decision-making in humans. Using the EEfRT, we test the hypothesis that effort-based decision-making is related to trait anhedonia. Methods/Results 61 undergraduate students participated in the experiment. Subjects completed self-report measures of mood and trait anhedonia, and completed the EEfRT. Across multiple analyses, we found a significant inverse relationship between anhedonia and willingness to expend effort for rewards. Conclusions These findings suggest that anhedonia is specifically associated with decreased motivation for rewards, and provide initial validation for the EEfRT as a laboratory-based behavioral measure of reward motivation and effort-based decision-making in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2060383679,"The nuclear factor κ enhancer binding protein (NF-κB) signalling pathway is important for a range of cellular processes including immune function. Here Xia et al. show that free Lys63 polyubiquitin chains generated, which are not linked to any protein substrates, can directly activate kinases in the NK- κB signalling pathway. Disassembly of the polyubiquitin chains by deubiquitination enzymes prevented kinase activation. These results suggest that unanchored polyubiquitin chains much like second messengers can directly activate kinases in immune and inflammatory pathways. The ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 is essential for the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases in several signalling pathways important for a range of cellular processes including immune function. TRAF6 functions together with a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex to activate the TAK1 kinase complex downstream, which in turn leads to the activation of NF-κB. Here, by reconstituting TAK1 activation in vitro, free Lys 63 polyubiquitin chains are shown to activate TAK1 directly. TRAF6 is a ubiquitin ligase that is essential for the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases in several signalling pathways, including those emanating from the interleukin 1 and Toll-like receptors1,2,3. TRAF6 functions together with a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex consisting of UBC13 (also known as UBE2N) and UEV1A (UBE2V1) to catalyse Lys 63-linked polyubiquitination, which activates the TAK1 (also known as MAP3K7) kinase complex4,5. TAK1 in turn phosphorylates and activates IκB kinase (IKK), leading to the activation of NF-κB. Although several proteins are known to be polyubiquitinated in the IL1R and Toll-like receptor pathways, it is not clear whether ubiquitination of any of these proteins is important for TAK1 or IKK activation. By reconstituting TAK1 activation in vitro using purified proteins, here we show that free Lys 63 polyubiquitin chains, which are not conjugated to any target protein, directly activate TAK1 by binding to the ubiquitin receptor TAB2 (also known as MAP3K7IP2). This binding leads to autophosphorylation and activation of TAK1. Furthermore, we found that unanchored polyubiquitin chains synthesized by TRAF6 and UBCH5C (also known as UBE2D3) activate the IKK complex. Disassembly of the polyubiquitin chains by deubiquitination enzymes prevented TAK1 and IKK activation. These results indicate that unanchored polyubiquitin chains directly activate TAK1 and IKK, suggesting a new mechanism of protein kinase regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1981804590,"Dense particle packings have served as useful models of the structures of liquid, glassy and crystalline states of matter, granular media, heterogeneous materials and biological systems. Probing the symmetries and other mathematical properties of the densest packings is a problem of interest in discrete geometry and number theory. Previous work has focused mainly on spherical particles-very little is known about dense polyhedral packings. Here we formulate the generation of dense packings of polyhedra as an optimization problem, using an adaptive fundamental cell subject to periodic boundary conditions (we term this the 'adaptive shrinking cell' scheme). Using a variety of multi-particle initial configurations, we find the densest known packings of the four non-tiling Platonic solids (the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron) in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The densities are 0.782..., 0.947..., 0.904... and 0.836..., respectively. Unlike the densest tetrahedral packing, which must not be a Bravais lattice packing, the densest packings of the other non-tiling Platonic solids that we obtain are their previously known optimal (Bravais) lattice packings. Combining our simulation results with derived rigorous upper bounds and theoretical arguments leads us to the conjecture that the densest packings of the Platonic and Archimedean solids with central symmetry are given by their corresponding densest lattice packings. This is the analogue of Kepler's sphere conjecture for these solids."

https://openalex.org/W1988229964,"Type Ia supernovae result when carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in binary systems accrete mass from companion stars, reach a critical mass, and explode. The near uniformity of their light curves makes these supernovae good standard candles for measuring cosmic expansion, but a correction must be applied to account for the fact that the brighter supernovae have broader light curves. One-dimensional modelling, with a certain choice of parameters, can reproduce this general trend in the width-luminosity relation, but the processes of ignition and detonation have recently been shown to be intrinsically asymmetric. Here we report on multi-dimensional modelling of the explosion physics and radiative transfer that reveals that the breaking of spherical symmetry is a critical factor in determining both the width luminosity relation and the observed scatter about it. The deviation from sphericity can also explain the finite polarization detected in the light from some supernovae. The slope and normalization of the width-luminosity relation has a weak dependence on certain properties of the white dwarf progenitor, in particular the trace abundances of elements other than carbon and oxygen. Failing to correct for this effect could lead to systematic overestimates of up to 2% in the distance to remote supernovae."
https://openalex.org/W2159638886,"In several autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), a compromised regulatory T cell (Treg) function is believed to be critically involved in the disease process. In vitro, the biologically active metabolite of vitamin D has been shown to promote Treg development. A poor vitamin D status has been linked with MS incidence and MS disease activity. In the present study, we assess a potential in vivo correlation between vitamin D status and Treg function in relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) patients.Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) were measured in 29 RRMS patients. The number of circulating Tregs was assessed by flow-cytometry, and their functionality was tested in vitro in a CFSE-based proliferation suppression assay. Additionally, the intracellular cytokine profile of T helper cells was determined directly ex-vivo by flow-cytometry. Serum levels of 25(OH)D correlated positively with the ability of Tregs to suppress T cell proliferation (R = 0.590, P = 0.002). No correlation between 25(OH)D levels and the number of Tregs was found. The IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio (Th1/Th2-balance) was more directed towards IL-4 in patients with favourable 25(OH)D levels (R = -0.435, P = 0.023).These results show an association of high 25(OH)D levels with an improved Treg function, and with skewing of the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th2. These findings suggest that vitamin D is an important promoter of T cell regulation in vivo in MS patients. It is tempting to speculate that our results may not only hold for MS, but also for other autoimmune diseases. Future intervention studies will show whether modulation of vitamin D status results in modulation of the T cell response and subsequent amelioration of disease activity."
https://openalex.org/W2028952616,"Atlantic tropical cyclone activity, as measured by annual storm counts, reached anomalous levels over the past decade. The short nature of the historical record and potential issues with its reliability in earlier decades, however, has prompted an ongoing debate regarding the reality and significance of the recent rise. Here we place recent activity in a longer-term context by comparing two independent estimates of tropical cyclone activity over the past 1,500 years. The first estimate is based on a composite of regional sedimentary evidence of landfalling hurricanes, while the second estimate uses a previously published statistical model of Atlantic tropical cyclone activity driven by proxy reconstructions of past climate changes. Both approaches yield consistent evidence of a peak in Atlantic tropical cyclone activity during medieval times (around ad 1000) followed by a subsequent lull in activity. The statistical model indicates that the medieval peak, which rivals or even exceeds (within uncertainties) recent levels of activity, results from the reinforcing effects of La-Niña-like climate conditions and relative tropical Atlantic warmth."
https://openalex.org/W1968109336,"Candida albicans is the most common fungal pathogen in humans, causing both debilitating mucosal infections and potentially life-threatening systemic infections. Until recently, C. albicans was thought to be strictly asexual, existing only as an obligate diploid. A cryptic mating cycle has since been uncovered in which diploid a and alpha cells undergo efficient cell and nuclear fusion, resulting in tetraploid a/alpha mating products. Whereas mating between a and alpha cells has been established (heterothallism), we report here two pathways for same-sex mating (homothallism) in C. albicans. First, unisexual populations of a cells were found to undergo autocrine pheromone signalling and same-sex mating in the absence of the Bar1 protease. In both C. albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bar1 is produced by a cells and inactivates mating pheromone alpha, typically secreted by alpha cells. C. albicans Deltabar1 a cells were shown to secrete both a and alpha mating pheromones; alpha-pheromone activated self-mating in these cells in a process dependent on Ste2, the receptor for alpha-pheromone. In addition, pheromone production by alpha cells was found to promote same-sex mating between wild-type a cells. These results establish that homothallic mating can occur in C. albicans, revealing the potential for genetic exchange even within unisexual populations of the organism. Furthermore, Bar1 protease has an unexpected but pivotal role in determining whether sexual reproduction can potentially be homothallic or is exclusively heterothallic. These findings also have implications for the mode of sexual reproduction in related species that propagate unisexually, and indicate a role for specialized sexual cycles in the survival and adaptation of pathogenic fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2030643716,"Dairy cattle breeds have been subjected over the last fifty years to intense artificial selection towards improvement of milk production traits. In this study, we performed a whole genome scan for differentiation using 42,486 SNPs in the three major French dairy cattle breeds (Holstein, Normande and Montbéliarde) to identify the main physiological pathways and regions which were affected by this selection. After analyzing the population structure, we estimated F(ST) within and across the three breeds for each SNP under a pure drift model. We further considered two different strategies to evaluate the effect of selection at the genome level. First, smoothing F(ST) values over each chromosome with a local variable bandwidth kernel estimator allowed identifying 13 highly significant regions subjected to strong and/or recent positive selection. Some of them contained genes within which causal variants with strong effect on milk production traits (GHR) or coloration (MC1R) have already been reported. To go further in the interpretation of the observed signatures of selection we subsequently concentrated on the annotation of differentiated genes defined according to the F(ST) value of SNPs localized close or within them. To that end we performed a comprehensive network analysis which suggested a central role of somatotropic and gonadotropic axes in the response to selection. Altogether, these observations shed light on the antagonism, at the genome level, between milk production and reproduction traits in highly producing dairy cows."
https://openalex.org/W1970041667,"Proteasome inhibitors are currently in the clinic or in clinical trials, but the mechanism of their anticancer activity is not completely understood. The oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1 is one of the most overexpressed genes in human tumors, while its expression is usually halted in normal non-proliferating cells. Previously, we established that thiazole antibiotics Siomycin A and thiostrepton inhibit FoxM1 and induce apoptosis in human cancer cells. Here, we report that Siomycin A and thiostrepton stabilize the expression of a variety of proteins, such as p21, Mcl-1, p53 and hdm-2 and also act as proteasome inhibitors in vitro. More importantly, we also found that well-known proteasome inhibitors such as MG115, MG132 and bortezomib inhibit FoxM1 transcriptional activity and FoxM1 expression. In addition, overexpression of FoxM1 specifically protects against bortezomib-, but not doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. These data suggest that negative regulation of FoxM1 by proteasome inhibitors is a general feature of these drugs and it may contribute to their anticancer properties."
https://openalex.org/W2016498245,"Targeting of newly synthesized membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum is an essential cellular process. Most membrane proteins are recognized and targeted co-translationally by the signal recognition particle. However, nearly 5% of membrane proteins are ‘tail-anchored’ by a single carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain that cannot access the co-translational pathway. Instead, tail-anchored proteins are targeted post-translationally by a conserved ATPase termed Get3. The mechanistic basis for tail-anchored protein recognition or targeting by Get3 is not known. Here we present crystal structures of yeast Get3 in ‘open’ (nucleotide-free) and ‘closed’ (ADP·AlF4--bound) dimer states. In the closed state, the dimer interface of Get3 contains an enormous hydrophobic groove implicated by mutational analyses in tail-anchored protein binding. In the open state, Get3 undergoes a striking rearrangement that disrupts the groove and shields its hydrophobic surfaces. These data provide a molecular mechanism for nucleotide-regulated binding and release of tail-anchored proteins during their membrane targeting by Get3. Tail-anchored (TA) proteins mediate essential biochemical processes in nearly every cellular membrane. They are integral membrane proteins containing a cytosolic N-terminal domain anchored to the membrane by a transmembrane domain. Recent studies have suggested that targeting of TA proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum is mediated by the cytosolic ATPase chaperone Get3. The crystal structure of Get3 has now been determined in 'open' nucleotide-free and 'closed' nucleotide-bound forms. The open-to-closed transition results in a substantial conformational change that unveils a large hydrophobic groove sufficient to accommodate TA substrates. These results provide a mechanistic understanding for nucleotide-regulated binding and release of TA proteins. Nearly 5% of membrane proteins are 'tail-anchored' to the endoplasmic reticulum by a single carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain. These tail-anchored proteins are targeted post-translationally by the ATPase Get3, but the mechanism of recognition and targeting by Get3 is not known. Here, the crystal structures of yeast Get3 in a nucleotide-free 'open' state and a nucleotide-bound 'closed' state are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2022946283,"While expectations and applications of nanotechnologies grow exponentially, little is known about interactions of engineered nanoparticles with multicellular organisms. Here we propose the transparent roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a simple but anatomically and biologically well defined animal model that allows for whole organism analyses of nanoparticle-bio-interactions. Microscopic techniques showed that fluorescently labelled nanoparticles are efficiently taken up by the worms during feeding, and translocate to primary organs such as epithelial cells of the intestine, as well as secondary organs belonging to the reproductive tract. The life span of nanoparticle-fed Caenorhabditis elegans remained unchanged, whereas a reduction of progeny production was observed in silica-nanoparticle exposed worms versus untreated controls. This reduction was accompanied by a significant increase of the ‘bag of worms’ phenotype that is characterized by failed egg-laying and usually occurs in aged wild type worms. Experimental exclusion of developmental defects suggests that silica-nanoparticles induce an age-related degeneration of reproductive organs, and thus set a research platform for both, detailed elucidation of molecular mechanisms and high throughput screening of different nanomaterials by analyses of progeny production."
https://openalex.org/W2017075573,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) are two related peptides that control calcium/phosphate homeostasis and bone development, respectively, through activation of the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R), a class B G protein-coupled receptor. Both peptides hold clinical interest for their capacities to stimulate bone formation. PTH and PTHrP display different selectivity for two distinct PTH1R conformations, but how their binding to the receptor differs is unclear. The high resolution crystal structure of PTHrP bound to the extracellular domain (ECD) of PTH1R reveals that PTHrP binds as an amphipathic α-helix to the same hydrophobic groove in the ECD as occupied by PTH, but in contrast to a straight, continuous PTH helix, the PTHrP helix is gently curved and C-terminally “unwound.” The receptor accommodates the altered binding modes by shifting the side chain conformations of two residues within the binding groove: Leu-41 and Ile-115, the former acting as a rotamer toggle switch to accommodate PTH/PTHrP sequence divergence, and the latter adapting to the PTHrP curvature. Binding studies performed with PTH/PTHrP hybrid ligands having reciprocal exchanges of residues involved in different contacts confirmed functional consequences for the altered interactions and enabled the design of altered PTH and PTHrP peptides that adopt the ECD-binding mode of the opposite peptide.

In bone, PTH directly stimulates osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation (reviewed in Ref. 6Jilka R.L. Bone. 2007; 40: 1434-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), which in turn activate osteoclasts to induce bone resorption. In the kidney, PTH stimulates the reabsorption of filtered calcium, inhibits the reabsorption of phosphate, and stimulates the synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The paradoxical anabolic/catabolic actions of PTH on bone can be modulated by exogenous PTH, and provide the molecular basis for the clinical use of PTH as an anabolic therapy for osteoporosis (7Neer R.M.

PTH and PTHrP are encoded by separate genes, each of which is found in vertebrate species ranging from fish to man. How PTH and PTHrP evolved to mediate distinct biological activities: calcium/phosphate homeostasis and tissue development, respectively, via actions upon a single receptor, remains unclear. Amino acid sequence homology is most apparent in the first 34-residue segments of the proteins, and N-terminal 34-residue peptide fragments of PTH and PTHrP are sufficient for high affinity binding to the PTH1R and are generally found to be equally potent for stimulating cAMP formation in PTH1R-expressing cells (1Jüppner H.

The interaction of the (1–34)-length ligand with the PTH1R has been postulated to follow a “two-domain” model: residues within the approximate (1–14) segment interact with the 7-transmembrane (7-TM) helical domain embedded in the membrane, and residues within the approximate (15–34) segment interact with the N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) of the receptor (17Bergwitz C.

One conformation, termed R0, is stable in the presence of GTPγS, but presumably in the absence of G protein coupling, correlates with prolonged signaling responses in vitro and in vivo, and is bound preferentially by PTH-(1–34). The other conformation, termed RG, is sensitive to GTPγS addition, promoted by the overexpression of a high affinity variant of Gαs, and bound preferentially by PTHrP-(1–36). A mechanistic basis for the differing capacities of PTH and PTHrP ligands to bind to these altered PTH1R conformations is not clear at present, although, both the (1–14) and (15–34) portions of PTH contribute importantly to the capacity to bind stably to the proposed R0 conformation (19Dean T.

We previously developed a method that allowed us to determine the high resolution crystal structure of recombinant PTH1R ECD in complex with the 15–34 synthetic fragment of PTH (23Pioszak A.A.

Here we present the high resolution crystal structure of the PTHrP 12–34 fragment in complex with the PTH1R ECD, which reveals a distinct docking conformation toward the C terminus of the PTHrP peptide. Based on the structural differences, we designed hybrid PTH/PTHrP peptides exchanged for residues involved in altered ECD contacts; functional analyses of these peptides confirmed that the altered modes of binding indeed translate into functional consequences in terms of receptor affinity. These results provide critical insights into how PTH and PTHrP can act through a single receptor, and a structural model for designing better PTH/PTHrP analogs for treating osteoporosis. A DNA fragment encoding human PTH1R residues 23–191 with a C-terminal six histidine residue tag and a stop codon was PCR-amplified from pcDNA3.1/PTH1R (23Pioszak A.A. Xu H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5034-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The fragment was digested with BamHI and NotI restriction endonucleases and ligated into a pETDuet1 vector (Novagen) encoding maltose-binding protein (MBP) followed by a thrombin cleavage site (Th) and a biotinylation tag sequence (GGLNDIFEAQKIEWHEDT; biotinylation site in bold) in multiple cloning site 1, and the BirA biotin ligase in multiple cloning site 2. The resulting vector co-expresses the MBP-Th-Biotin tag-PTH1R ECD-H6 fusion protein and BirA. The construct was verified by automated DNA sequencing of the coding regions. The MBP-PTH1R ECD-H6 fusion protein used for crystallization, which contains residues 29–187 of human PTH1R fused to the C terminus of bacterial MBP, was previously described (23Pioszak A.A. Xu H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5034-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The MBP-Th-Biotin tag-PTH1R ECD-H6 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli Origami B (DE3) cells (Novagen). The cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to mid-log phase, then the temperature was reduced to 16 °C, biotin was added to 5 μm final concentration, and protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for a total induction time of ∼19 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the fusion protein was purified as previously described for the MBP-PTH1R ECD-H6 fusion protein (23Pioszak A.A. Xu H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5034-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Native gel electrophoresis of the purified sample suggested that the protein was ∼50% biotinylated as evidenced by two distinct bands of slightly different mobility (data not shown). The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Peptides for ECD binding studies and crystallization were custom-synthesized and HPLC-purified by SynBioSci (Livermore, CA). PTH/PTHrP-(1–34)NH2 hybrid peptides were synthesized and HPLC-purified by the Massachusetts General Hospital Biopolymer Core facility. The interaction between biotinylated PTH1R ECD and PTH(1–34)NH2 and PTHrP(1–34)NH2 was analyzed by bio-layer interferometry technology using the Octet Red system (ForteBio). MBP was removed from the MBP-Th-Biotin tag-PTH1R ECD fusion protein by overnight digestion at 4 °C with human α-thrombin (Hematologic Technologies Inc.) at a 1:750 ratio (weight/weight) of protease to fusion protein in Krebs-Ringers-HEPES (KRH) buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4) supplemented with 2 mg/ml BSA. Complete cleavage was verified by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). High binding streptavidin sensors were incubated with the digestion reaction diluted to 2 μg/ml protein, followed by a 10 μg/ml biocytin block, and three washes in KRH buffer with 2 mg/ml BSA to wash away non-biotinylated components of the digestion mixture and establish a baseline. The peptides were diluted in KRH buffer with 2 mg/ml BSA, and their association and dissociation were monitored for 20 min each at 25 °C. To account for nonspecific binding, traces obtained with peptide and sensor tips lacking PTH1R ECD were subtracted from the traces obtained with the peptides and immobilized PTH1R ECD. In addition, a baseline drift was subtracted using a trace from a sensor tip that had immobilized PTH1R ECD, but no peptide. Octet Red analysis software was used to analyze the data. The binding of peptides to the MBP-PTH1R ECD-H6 fusion protein was assessed with an AlphaScreen luminescent proximity assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature and contained 5 μg/ml each of streptavidin-coated donor beads and nickel chelate-coated acceptor beads, and 23 nm each of N-terminally biotinylated PTH(7–34)NH2 and MBP-PTH1R ECD-H6 in a buffer of 50 mm MOPS pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 7 mg/ml BSA. The biotinylated PTH and MBP-PTH1R ECD-H6 were separately pre-coupled for 1 h to the streptavidin and nickel-chelate beads, respectively. The pre-coupling reactions were mixed, unlabeled competitor peptides were added as indicated, and the reactions were incubated 4–5 h to reach equilibrium. Photon counts were recorded in 384-well optiplates using an Envision 2104 plate reader (PerkinElmer). Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego) was used to fit the data to a fixed slope dose-response inhibition equation for determination of IC50 values. MBP-PTH1R ECD-H6 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm maltose, and 1 mm EDTA was mixed with a synthetic PTHrP fragment (residues 12–34) at a 1:1.1 molar ratio (protein/peptide), incubated on ice for 30 min, and spin concentrated to 20 mg/ml for crystallization. Bipyramidal crystals were grown by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C with a reservoir solution of 7.5% PEG 2000, 13% PEG 400. The crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant solution of 10% PEG 2000, 22% PEG 400, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA by dialysis overnight and then were flash-frozen by plunging into liquid nitrogen. A data set was collected from a single crystal at LS-CAT beamline 21-ID-F of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL) at a wavelength of 0.9785 Å and temperature of 100 K. The HKL2000 package (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar) was used to process the data, and the Scalepack intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes with the CCP4 suite (29Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). There was no evidence of significant radiation damage in the dataset. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (30McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl.

Iterative cycles of rebuilding in O (31Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A.

D Biol Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar) was included using two TLS groups corresponding to the MBP-maltose complex and the ECD-PTHrP complex. Structure validation with Procheck (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicated that 93.6% of the residues were in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot and no residues were in the disallowed region. The data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. Analyses of solvent accessible surface area and shape complementarity were performed within the CCP4 suite.

Open table in a new tab Peptide binding to the G protein-uncoupled receptor (R0) and G protein-coupled receptor (RG) conformations in COS-7 cell membranes was assessed as previously described (22Okazaki M. Ferrandon S. Vilardaga J.P. Bouxsein M.L. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 16525-16530Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Peptide stimulation of cAMP accumulation in COS-1 cells transiently expressing human PTH1R was performed in 96-well tissue culture plates as previously described (36Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30363-30372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). cAMP was quantitated with a LANCE cAMP kit (PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We first determined the binding of PTH and PTHrP ligands to the purified MBP-PTH1R ECD-H6 fusion protein using an AlphaScreen assay. In this assay, the N-terminally biotinylated PTH(7–34)NH2 fragment is bound to streptavidin-coated donor beads, and the fusion protein is bound via its His6 tag to nickel chelate-coated acceptor beads. Association of the PTH-(7–34) ligand with the fusion protein brings the beads into proximity and thus generates a luminescent signal. We previously showed that PTH(15–34)NH2 inhibits this association with an IC50 value of ∼1 μm, which was similar to the Kd value determined for the binding of PTH(15–34)NH2 to the fusion protein by isothermal titration calorimetry (23Pioszak A.A. Xu H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5034-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). PTH(1–34)NH2 and PTH(12–34)NH2 each inhibited the AlphaScreen interaction with an IC50 value of ∼1 μm (Fig. 1A), in agreement with our previous observations. However, PTH(1–34)OH bound the ECD with an affinity ∼10-fold lower than that of the C-terminally amidated peptide (Fig. 1A). This lower binding affinity can be reconciled by the crystal structure of the PTH1R ECD-PTH(15–34)NH2 complex, which shows that two hydrogen bonds are formed between the ECD and the ligand C-terminal amide (23Pioszak A.A. Xu H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5034-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In contrast, PTHrP(12–34)NH2 and PTHrP(12–34)OH inhibited the association with similar IC50 values of ∼2 μm (Fig. 1B); thus, a C-terminal amide group is not essential for high affinity binding of PTHrP to the ECD. We also examined the interaction of the peptides with the isolated ECD using the Octet Red system (ForteBio), which uses biolayer interferometry technology to monitor binding events in real time. The isolated PTH1R ECD (residues 23–191) free of MBP and biotinylated at a single residue at the N terminus was immobilized on the surface of streptavidin sensor tips, and the binding of PTH(1–34)NH2 and PTHrP(1–34)NH2 free in solution was assessed over time. Steady-state analysis of the real time binding curves (supplemental Fig. S1) indicated that PTH and PTHrP bound the ECD with Kd values of 2.8 μm and 0.99 μm, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). The Kd value for PTH binding to the ECD is similar to that obtained by others using Biacore technology (37Grauschopf U. Lilie H. Honold K. Wozny M. Reusch D. Esswein A. Schäfer W. Rücknagel K.P. Rudolph R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8878-8887Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The binding data taken together indicate that PTH and PTHrP bind the PTH1R ECD with similar affinities, but suggest differences in the underlying biochemical mechanisms, because C-terminal amidation affects the ability of PTH, but not PTHrP, to bind the ECD. To assess receptor binding mechanisms of PTHrP, we determined the crystal structure of the MBP-PTH1R ECD-H6 fusion protein in complex with PTHrP(12–34)NH2. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined at 1.94 Å resolution to an R factor of 19.3% (free R factor 23.3%) (Table 1). Electron density was observed for all PTH1R residues except segments 29–30, 57–101, 176–187, and the C-terminal His6 tag, which were excluded from the final model. The PTH1R ECD forms the conserved class B GPCR ECD fold observed previously (23Pioszak A.A. Xu H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5034-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and the PTHrP ligand forms an amphipathic α-helix that occupies the hydrophobic groove formed in the ECD at the interfaces of the N-terminal α-helix, the two β-sheets, and the short, C-terminal α-helix (Fig. 2, A and B). Clear electron density was observed for PTHrP residues 13–34 (Fig. 2C). The intermolecular interface is formed largely by hydrophobic interactions involving PTHrP residues Phe-23′, Leu-24′, Leu-27′, and Ile-28′, which contact the hydrophobic groove of the ECD formed by residues Leu-41, Ile-115, Ile-135, Phe-138, and Tyr-167 (Fig. 2, B and D). (Peptide residues are denoted with a prime to distinguish them from receptor residues.) In addition, an extensive network of hydrogen bonds anchors the peptide N and C termini (Fig. 2, D and E). The conserved R20′ forms an intermolecular salt bridge with Asp-137, an intermolecular hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of Met-32, and intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Asp-17′ (Fig. 2D). The PTHrP helix “unwinds” at the C terminus after residue Ile-31′ permitting the formation of several additional hydrogen bonds, including those between the δ nitrogen of His-32′ and the backbone amide nitrogen of Tyr-167, between the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr-33′ and the backbone amide nitrogen of Ala-165 and backbone carbonyl of Thr-163, and between the backbone carbonyl of Ala-165 and the backbone amide nitrogens of Thr-33′ and Ala-34′ (Fig. 2E). Consistent with our binding data in Fig. 1B, the C-terminal amide group of PTHrP does not form any interactions with the ECD. Arg-19′ forms a salt bridge with Glu-35, but this interaction may be caused by a crystal packing interaction that limits the mobility of Arg-19′ (not shown). Mutational and cross-linking data suggest that in the intact ligand-receptor complex, Arg-19′ contacts the 7-TM domain of the receptor (38Gensure R.C. Shimizu N. Tsang J. Gardella T.J. Mol. End"
https://openalex.org/W2149664216,"Ectopic Wnt signaling induces increased stem/progenitor cell activity in the mouse mammary gland, followed by tumor development. The Wnt signaling receptors, Lrp5/6, are uniquely required for canonical Wnt activity. Previous data has shown that the absence of Lrp5 confers resistance to Wnt1-induced tumor development.Here, we show that all basal mammary cells express Lrp5, and co-express Lrp6 in a similar fashion. Though Wnt dependent transcription of key target genes is relatively unchanged in mammary epithelial cell cultures, the absence of Lrp5 specifically depletes adult regenerative stem cell activity (to less than 1%). Stem cell activity can be enriched by >200 fold (over 80% of activity), based on high Lrp5 expression alone. Though Lrp5 null glands have apparent normal function, the basal lineage is relatively reduced (from 42% basal/total epithelial cells to 22%) and Lrp5-/- mammary epithelial cells show enhanced expression of senescence-associated markers in vitro, as measured by expression of p16(Ink4a) and TA-p63.This is the first single biomarker that has been demonstrated to be functionally involved in stem cell maintenance. Together, these results demonstrate that Wnt signaling through Lrp5 is an important component of normal mammary stem cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1968240894,"DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are unique among DNA lesions in their unusually bulky nature. The steric hindrance imposed by cross-linked proteins (CLPs) will hamper DNA transactions, such as replication and transcription, posing an enormous threat to cells. In bacteria, DPCs with small CLPs are eliminated by nucleotide excision repair (NER), whereas oversized DPCs are processed exclusively by RecBCD-dependent homologous recombination (HR). Here we have assessed the roles of NER and HR for DPCs in mammalian cells. We show that the upper size limit of CLPs amenable to mammalian NER is relatively small (8–10 kDa) so that NER cannot participate in the repair of chromosomal DPCs in mammalian cells. Moreover, CLPs are not polyubiquitinated and hence are not subjected to proteasomal degradation prior to NER. In contrast, HR constitutes the major pathway in tolerance of DPCs as judged from cell survival and RAD51 and γ-H2AX nuclear foci formation. Induction of DPCs results in the accumulation of DNA double strand breaks in HR-deficient but not HR-proficient cells, suggesting that fork breakage at the DPC site initiates HR and reactivates the stalled fork. DPCs activate both ATR and ATM damage response pathways, but there is a time lag between two responses.

Weinfeld M. Murray D. Mutat. Res. 2005; 589: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). DPCs are also produced by anticancer drugs, such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (azadC) and cisplatin (1Barker S. Weinfeld M. Murray D. Mutat. Res. 2005; 589: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 2Gowher H. Jeltsch A. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although some classes of DPCs contain a flanking strand break (e.g. covalently trapped topoisomerases) (3Reardon J.T. Cheng Y. Sancar A. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1366-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), typical (and probably the most common) DPCs contain proteins irreversibly trapped on the uninterrupted DNA strand. It is readily inferred from the unusually bulky nature of cross-linked proteins (CLPs) that steric hindrance imposed by CLPs on proteins involved in DNA transactions would hamper replication, transcription, and repair. Consistent with this notion, DPCs incorporated into oligonucleotides and plasmid DNA block DNA replication in vitro (4Chválová K. Brabec V. Kaspárková J.

Moreover, CLPs attenuate the binding of the damage recognition protein (UvrB) involved in bacterial nucleotide excision repair (NER) in a size-dependent manner (7Nakano T. Morishita S. Katafuchi A.

Conversely, it has been largely elusive how cells circumvent the genotoxic effects of DPCs. We recently showed that NER and homologous recombination (HR) play pivotal roles in mitigating the genotoxic effects of DPCs in bacteria (7Nakano T. Morishita S. Katafuchi A. Matsubara M. Horikawa Y.

Interestingly, the two pathways contribute differentially to the tolerance of DPCs. In NER catalyzed by UvrABC, the excision efficiency for DPCs varies dramatically with the size of CLPs both in vitro and in vivo and is attenuated by steric hindrance of CLPs. The upper size limit of CLPs amenable to NER in vitro was around 16 kDa, but the biologically relevant size limit was lower in vivo, at around 11 kDa. DPCs with oversized CLPs are processed exclusively by RecB-dependent HR. Given that HR can also process DPCs containing small CLPs, HR is a versatile mechanism for DPC tolerance, whereas NER makes a limited but still significant contribution to the repair of DPCs in bacterial cells. Although the study provides a paradigm for the repair of DPCs in cells, it remains to be seen whether NER and HR are also closely coordinated to deal with unusually bulky DNA lesions, such as DPCs, in higher organisms. As for bacterial NER (8Minko I.G. Zou Y. Lloyd R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1905-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Minko I.G. Kurtz A.J. Croteau D.L. Van Houten B. Harris T.M. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3000-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it has been reported that the in vitro activity of mammalian NER for DPCs is dependent on the size of CLPs. Mammalian cell-free extracts (CFEs) make efficient damage-specific incisions for DPCs containing short peptides comprising 4 or 12 amino acids (0.57 and 1.5 kDa) but not for those containing 16-kDa T4 endonuclease V, 22-kDa histone H1, and 37-kDa HhaI DNA cytosine methyltransferase (DNMT) (5Novakova O. Kasparkova J. Malina J. Natile G. Brabec V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6450-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although these data indicate that the mammalian NER system is sensitive to the size of CLPs, it remains to be clarified whether NER participates in the repair of DPCs in mammalian cells as in bacterial cells. In addition to direct repair of DPCs by NER, an alternative repair model of DPCs has also been proposed, in which CLPs are initially degraded to short peptides by the proteasome, and the resulting DNA-peptide cross-links are removed by NER (3Reardon J.T. Cheng Y. Sancar A. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1366-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Minko I.G. Kurtz A.J. Croteau D.L. Van Houten B. Harris T.M. Lloyd R.S.

In the present study, we assessed the roles of NER and HR in tolerance of DPCs using a mammalian system. Several lines of in vitro and in vivo evidence indicate that NER alone or NER coupled with proteasomal degradation of CLPs does not contribute to the repair of DPCs, whereas HR initiated by fork breakage at DPCs plays a pivotal role in tolerance of DPCs in mammalian cells. These results highlight the differential involvement of NER in the repair of DPCs in bacterial and mammalian cells and demonstrate the versatile and conserved role of HR in tolerance of DPCs among species. The 150-mer oligonucleotides containing oxanine (150OXA) or oxanine-protein cross-links (150OXA-DPC) were prepared as described in the supplemental materials.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and kanamycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells in the midlogarithmic phase were treated with 0.5 mm FA in FBS-free DMEM at 37 °C for 3 h and allowed to repair in fresh media for up to 4 h. Typically, cells from four 150-mm dishes were combined, lysed in PBS containing 1% Sarkosyl, and subjected to CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Fluorescence analysis of CLPs with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Dojindo) was performed as described previously (7Nakano T. Morishita S. Katafuchi A. Matsubara M. Horikawa Y. Terato H. Salem A.M.

For analysis with 2-methoxy-2,4-diphenyl-3(2H)-furanone (MDPF; Tokyo Chemical Industry), DNA was heated at 70 °C for 6 h to release CLPs. The sample (150 μl) was dialyzed extensively against water using a microdialysis cup (Bio-Tech International) at 4 °C. Internal and external solutions of dialysis were recovered separately, and the volume was reduced to 150 μl by a centrifugation evaporator. The sample was incubated with 0.38 mm MDPF at room temperature for 1 h, and the fluorescence intensity was measured at 520 nm (FITC) or 485 nm (MDPF). DNA (50 μg) isolated from mock- and FA-treated WI38VA13 cells (with or without parallel treatment with MG132), ubiquitinated lysozyme (Hokudo), and lysozyme were vacuum slot-blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk; washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST) comprising 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20; incubated with the FK1 antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (BIOMOL); and washed again with TBST. The chemiluminescence signal was detected with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare) on a FAS1000 imaging analyzer (TOYOBO). Alternatively, DNA (160 μg, heated at 70 °C for 6 h to release CLPs) or control ubiquitinated lysozyme was mixed with an affinity matrix (40 μl) for ubiquitinated proteins (UbiQapture-Q kit; BIOMOL). The sample was mixed on a rotator at 4 °C overnight. The supernatant was removed (unbound fraction), and the matrix was washed twice with PBS (wash-1 and wash-2 fractions). Finally, bound proteins were eluted with SDS-loading buffer comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue (elute fraction). Proteins in each fraction were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with the Silver Stain-II kit (Daiich Pure Chemical). Human and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (supplemental Table S2) were grown in DMEM and Eagle's MEM (Nissui), respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS and kanamycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Exponentially growing cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes and incubated for 12 h. For FA treatment, the medium was changed to FBS-free DMEM or Eagle's MEM containing FA (0–0.5 mm), and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. For azadC treatment, the medium was changed to DMEM or Eagle's MEM containing azadC (0–5 μm) and FBS, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were washed with fresh media twice and allowed to form colonies. Colonies with more than 50 cells were counted after 7–12 days. The formation of RAD51 and γ-H2AX nuclear foci was analyzed, as reported previously (15Kobayashi J. Tauchi H. Sakamoto S. Nakamura A. Morishima K. Matsuura S. Kobayashi T. Tamai K. Tanimoto K.

Briefly, MRC5SV cells were plated onto glass slides, treated with 0.1 mm FA or 1 μm azadC, and subjected to repair incubation as described under “Cell Survival.” Cells were fixed with cold methanol for 20 min, rinsed with cold acetone for several seconds, and then air-dried. The fixed cells were incubated with anti-RAD51 (BioAcademia) and anti-γ-H2AX (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies and subsequently with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 or Alexa 546 (Molecular Probes), mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO) containing 2 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Stained cells were visualized on a fluorescence microscope. Cells were treated with FA (0.2 mm, 3 h) or azadC (1 μm, 24 h) as described above and further incubated for 6 h (FA) or 12 h (azadC) in fresh media without FA and azadC. Comet assays (single cell gel electrophoresis) were performed according to the published procedure (17Speit G. Hartmann A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 314: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Aliquots (10 μl) of cell suspension (about 30,000 cells) were mixed with 0.5% low melting point agarose (120 μl) and added to microscope slides, which had been covered with a bottom layer of 1.5% agarose. Cell lysis and electrophoresis were performed at 4 °C. With FA, an additional proteinase K treatment was performed after the lysis of FA-treated cells (18Speit G. Schütz P. Högel J. Schmid O. Mutagenesis. 2007; 22: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed at pH 10 overnight. Slides were kept in neutral or alkaline electrophoresis buffer for 20 min before electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was performed at 1 V/cm for 20 min (neutral) or 30 min (alkaline). Cells were stained with ethidium bromide, and their images were captured on a fluorescence microscope. Tail moments of 50–100 randomly selected cells were measured using Comet Assay IV software (Perceptive Instruments). WI38VA13 cells were treated with FA (0.4 mm) or azadC (2 μm) as described under “Cell Survival.” For control, cells were mock-treated or irradiated by UV light (50 J/m2). After appropriate periods of repair incubation (indicated in Fig. 6A), cells were collected and lysed with lysis buffer comprising 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Proteins (150 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with CHK1, CHK2, phospho-CHK1 (Ser317), and phospho-CHK2 (Ser19) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) or with the monoclonal actin antibody (Thermo Scientific). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) or horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG antibodies (CHEMICON International) were used to detect primary antibodies. It has been shown by using CFEs that the mammalian NER system barely makes damage-specific 5′ incisions for DPCs containing 16–37-kDa CLPs, whereas it does so for DPCs containing short peptides of 0.57 and 1.5 kDa (5Novakova O. Kasparkova J. Malina J. Natile G. Brabec V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6450-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The size limit is crucial to predicting whether NER can participate in the repair of DPCs in vivo. To determine the upper size limit, we prepared a 150-mer oligonucleotide containing oxanine (150OXA), and peptides and proteins of various sizes were tethered to oxanine to prepare defined DPC substrates (150OXA-DPCs; supplemental Fig. S1). Oxanine reacts with proteins and polyamines to form stable adducts (7Nakano T. Morishita S. Katafuchi A. Matsubara M. Horikawa Y. Terato H. Salem A.M. Izumi S. Pack S.P. Makino K. Ide H. Mol.

Mutagenesis. 2005; 20: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Duplex 150OXA-DPCs (the DPC-containing strand was 5′-end 32P-labeled) were incubated with CFEs from NER-proficient HeLa cells. PAGE analysis of reaction products revealed that the CFEs made clear incisions around the 21st phosphodiester bond 5′ to DPCs (Fig. 1, A and B (left)). The 5′ incision efficiency initially rose with the CLP size up to 1.6 kDa and then decreased thereafter (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S2), with activity being negligible for the 11-kDa protein. The plot of the 5′ incision efficiency against the CLP size (Fig. 1C) indicates that the upper size limit of CLPs amenable to human NER is around 8–10 kDa in vitro. The HeLa CFEs also made CLP size-dependent 3′ incisions at the 6th phosphodiester bond 3′ to DPCs (Fig. 1, A and B (right)). Thus, human NER excises 26–29-mer fragments containing DPCs, with the incision sites being independent of the size of CLPs. It was confirmed that 5′ incisions for DPCs were attributable to NER activity; the 5′ incision activity for DPCs was not observed with CFEs from NER-deficient human xeroderma pigmentosum XPA or XPF cells, but it was restored when CFEs from both cells were combined (supplemental Fig. S3). We also compared the size limits of CLPs amenable to bacterial and human NER. UvrAB and UvrC from thermophilic bacteria (B. caldotenax UvrAB and T. maritime UvrC) were used for bacterial NER, and 5′ incision activity was assayed with 60-mer oligonucleotides containing DPCs (60OXA-DPC), as reported previously (7Nakano T. Morishita S. Katafuchi A. Matsubara M. Horikawa Y. Terato H. Salem A.M. Izumi S. Pack S.P. Makino K. Ide H. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The size limit of CLPs incised by UvrABC was 16 kDa at 37 °C, but it was shifted to around 20–22 kDa at 55 °C, a suboptimal temperature for thermophilic UvrABC (Fig. 1C, right). At the same time, as for human NER, a clear activity peak was observed for the 1.6-kDa CLP. Comparison of in vitro incision activity for DPCs between bacterial and human NER indicates that the upper size limit of CLPs amenable to human NER (8–10 kDa) is considerably lower than that of bacterial NER (16 kDa at 37 °C or 20–22 kDa at 55 °C), although both NER systems share the activity peak for 1.6-kDa CLPs. We have previously shown that in Escherichia coli cells, DPCs containing proteins of sizes less than 11 kDa are excised from chromosomal DNA in wild type (WT) but not in NER-deficient uvrA cells that had been exposed to FA, a typical DPC-inducing agent (7Nakano T. Morishita S. Katafuchi A. Matsubara M. Horikawa Y. Terato H. Salem A.M. Izumi S. Pack S.P. Makino K. Ide H. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To assess the role of NER in the repair of DPCs in mammalian cells, human NER-proficient (WI38VA13) and NER-deficient XPA (XP12ROSV) cells were treated with 0.5 mm FA for 3 h and then subjected to post-repair incubation in FA-free media for up to 4 h. The chromosomal DNA was isolated by CsCl density gradient centrifugation. FA-induced cross-links were reversed by heat treatment, and released proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed various CLPs that were common to WT and XPA cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 6). Such CLPs were absent without FA treatment (lanes 1 and 5). The smallest proteins cross-linked by FA were 7.4 and 8.0 kDa (indicated by the asterisks in Fig. 2B). Importantly, in both WT and XPA cells, the amounts of individual CLPs barely changed during the course of post-repair incubation for up to 4 h (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–4 and 6–8), indicating that NER was unable to excise FA-induced DPCs containing even the smallest CLPs (7.4 and 8.0 kDa). This contrasts with our previous observation with E. coli, where FA-induced chromosomal DPCs containing CLPs smaller than 11 kDa were actively removed by NER in vivo (7Nakano T. Morishita S. Katafuchi A. Matsubara M. Horikawa Y. Terato H. Salem A.M. Izumi S. Pack S.P. Makino K. Ide H. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We also assessed the removal of chromosomal DPCs by fluorescence labeling (Fig. 2A). The DNA isolated from FA-treated cells (without heat treatment) was incubated with FITC that reacts with the amino group of proteins but not with DNA. After removing free FITC, the fluorescence signal was measured. Surprisingly, the FITC signal decreased significantly during the course of repair incubation for WT but not for XPA and XPC cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that NER removed certain FA-induced adducts (cross-link adducts (CLXs)) that were smaller than 7.4 kDa and not detectable by the SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2B). The adducts were reversibly released from DNA upon heat treatment (see below), indicating that the adducts were cross-links between DNA and nonprotein chromatin components. The CLXs were further characterized. The DNA isolated from FA-treated cells was heated to release CLPs and CLXs, and the sample was dialyzed extensively using a dialysis membrane with a cut-off size of 3.5 kDa. The compounds retained in the dialysis cup (>3.5 kDa) and those released from it (<3.5 kDa) were treated separately with MDPF, which became fluorescent after reacting with primary amines. The change in the MDPF signal with repair incubation time showed that in WT cells, the adducts smaller than 3.5 kDa were rapidly removed within 2 h, whereas those greater than 3.5 kDa were removed very slowly (Fig. 2D, top). This result implies two types of CLXs that were removed by NER, one smaller than 3.5 kDa and the other between 3.5 and 7.4 kDa. Neither type of CLXs (<3.5 and >3.5 kDa) was detected in the 2.5–6.2-kDa region of SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B). It is possible that adducts were diffused or eluted out of the gel during electrophoresis or staining (smaller CLXs) or produced in low yields (larger CLXs). The detailed nature of CLXs remains to be elucidated, but a candidate for the smaller component (<3.5 kDa) is a cross-link between the DNA base and polyamines present in chromatin. In XPA cells, neither type of CLXs (<3.5 and >3.5 kDa) was removed during repair incubation (Fig. 2D, bottom). The SDS-PAGE and MDPF data (Fig. 2, B and D) together suggest that NER is directed to the repair of CLXs but not to CLPs in FA-treated cells. The removal of CLXs (but not CLPs) by NER probably contributes to the survival of FA-treated cells, since XPA cells exhibited a moderate sensitivity to FA as compared with WT cells (Fig. 2E, left). The absence of a role of NER in the removal of CLPs was substantiated by the lack of sensitivity of XPA cells to azadC (Fig. 2E, right), which specifically induces DPCs containing 33–183-kDa DNMTs (21Liu K. Wang Y.F. Cantemir C. Muller M.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2709-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The mammalian NER system exhibited no measurable repair activity for FA-induced chromosomal DPCs in vivo (Fig. 2B). However, it shows a robust activity for DPCs containing short peptides in vitro (Fig. 1) (10Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Here, we discovered size-limited expansion of CAG repeats during repair of 8-oxoG in a wild-type mouse cell extract. This expansion was deficient in extracts from cells lacking pol beta and HMGB1. We demonstrate that expansion is mediated through pol beta multinucleotide gap-filling DNA synthesis during long-patch base excision repair. Unexpectedly, FEN1 promotes expansion by facilitating ligation of hairpins formed by strand slippage. This alternate role of FEN1 and the polymerase beta (pol beta) multinucleotide gap-filling synthesis is the result of uncoupling of the usual coordination between pol beta and FEN1. HMGB1 probably promotes expansion by stimulating APE1 and FEN1 in forming single strand breaks and ligatable nicks, respectively. This is the first report illustrating that disruption of pol beta and FEN1 coordination during long-patch BER results in CAG repeat expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2085543881,"Background Inflammation in the early stages of sepsis is governed by the innate immune response. Costimulatory molecules are a receptor/ligand class of molecules capable of regulation of inflammation in innate immunity via macrophage/neutrophil contact. We recently described that CD80/86 ligation is required for maximal macrophage activation and CD80/86−/− mice display reduced mortality and inflammatory cytokine production after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). However, these data also demonstrate differential regulation of CD80 and CD86 expression in sepsis, suggesting a divergent role for these receptors. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the individual contribution of CD80/86 family members in regulating inflammation in sepsis. Methodology/Principal Findings CD80−/− mice had improved survival after CLP when compared to WT or CD86−/− mice. This was associated with preferential attenuation of inflammatory cytokine production in CD80−/− mice. Results were confirmed with pharmacologic blockade, with anti-CD80 mAb rescuing mice when administered before or after CLP. In vitro, activation of macrophages with neutrophil lipid rafts caused selective disassociation of IRAK-M, a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling from CD80; providing a mechanism for preferential regulation of cytokine production by CD80. Finally, in humans, upregulation of CD80 and loss of constitutive CD86 expression on monocytes was associated with higher severity of illness and inflammation confirming the findings in our mouse model. Conclusions In conclusion, our data describe a differential role for CD80 and CD86 in regulation of inflammation in the innate immune response to sepsis. Future therapeutic strategies for blockade of the CD80/86 system in sepsis should focus on direct inhibition of CD80."
https://openalex.org/W1965110602,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces a complex network of pathways collectively termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). The clarification of these pathways has linked the UPR to the regulation of several physiological processes. However, its crosstalk with cellular iron metabolism remains unclear, which prompted us to examine whether an UPR affects the expression of relevant iron-related genes. For that purpose, the HepG2 cell line was used as model and the UPR was activated by dithiothreitol (DTT) and homocysteine (Hcys). Here, we report that hepcidin, a liver secreted hormone that shepherds iron homeostasis, exhibits a biphasic pattern of expression following UPR activation: its levels decreased in an early stage and increased with the maintenance of the stress response. Furthermore, we show that immediately after stressing the ER, the stress-inducible transcription factor CHOP depletes C/EBPα protein pool, which may in turn impact on the activation of hepcidin transcription. In the later period of the UPR, CHOP levels decreased progressively, enhancing C/EBPα-binding to the hepcidin promoter. In addition, analysis of ferroportin and ferritin H revealed that the transcript levels of these iron-genes are increased by the UPR signaling pathways. Taken together, our findings suggest that the UPR can have a broad impact on the maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis."

Recently, we found that factors secreted by PA6 cells provided lineage-specific instructions to induce DA differentiation of human ESC (hESC).In the present study, we compared PA6 cells to various cell lines lacking the SDIA effect, and employed genome expression analysis to identify differentially-expressed signaling molecules. Among the factors highly expressed by PA6 cells, and known to be associated with CNS development, were stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), pleiotrophin (PTN), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), and ephrin B1 (EFNB1). When these four factors, the combination of which was termed SPIE, were applied to hESC, they induced differentiation to TH-positive neurons in vitro. RT-PCR and western blot analysis confirmed the expression of midbrain specific markers, including engrailed 1, Nurr1, Pitx3, and dopamine transporter (DAT) in cultures influenced by these four molecules. Electrophysiological recordings showed that treatment of hESC with SPIE induced differentiation of neurons that were capable of generating action potentials and forming functional synaptic connections.The combination of SDF-1, PTN, IGF2, and EFNB1 mimics the DA phenotype-inducing property of SDIA and was sufficient to promote differentiation of hESC to functional midbrain DA neurons. These findings provide a method for differentiating hESC to form DA neurons, without a requirement for the use of animal-derived cell lines or products."
https://openalex.org/W2007324575,"The nuclear pore complex (NPC) constitutes one of the largest protein assemblies in the eukaryotic cell and forms the exclusive gateway to the nucleus. The stable, approximately 15-20-MDa scaffold ring of the NPC is built from two multiprotein complexes arranged around a central 8-fold axis. Here we present crystal structures of two large architectural units, yNup170(979-1502) and hNup107(658-925) x hNup133(517-1156), each a constituent of one of the two multiprotein complexes. Conservation of domain arrangement and of tertiary structure suggests that Nup157/170 and Nup133 derived from a common ancestor. Together with the previously established ancestral coatomer element (ACE1), these two elements constitute the major alpha-helical building blocks of the NPC scaffold and define its branched, lattice-like architecture, similar to vesicle coats like COPII. We hypothesize that the extant NPC evolved early during eukaryotic evolution from a rudimentary structure composed of several identical copies of a few ancestral elements, later diversified and specified by gene duplication."

https://openalex.org/W2022075247,"An excess of caffeine is cytotoxic to all eukaryotic cell types. We aim to study how cells become tolerant to a toxic dose of this drug, and the relationship between caffeine and oxidative stress pathways.We searched for Schizosaccharomyces pombe mutants with inhibited growth on caffeine-containing plates. We screened a collection of 2,700 haploid mutant cells, of which 98 were sensitive to caffeine. The genes mutated in these sensitive clones were involved in a number of cellular roles including the H(2)O(2)-induced Pap1 and Sty1 stress pathways, the integrity and calcineurin pathways, cell morphology and chromatin remodeling. We have investigated the role of the oxidative stress pathways in sensing and promoting survival to caffeine. The Pap1 and the Sty1 pathways are both required for normal tolerance to caffeine, but only the Sty1 pathway is activated by the drug. Cells lacking Pap1 are sensitive to caffeine due to the decreased expression of the efflux pump Hba2. Indeed, ?hba2 cells are sensitive to caffeine, and constitutive activation of the Pap1 pathway enhances resistance to caffeine in an Hba2-dependent manner.With our caffeine-sensitive, genome-wide screen of an S. pombe deletion collection, we have demonstrated the importance of some oxidative stress pathway components on wild-type tolerance to the drug."
https://openalex.org/W2055332853,"Background Early recognition and prompt and appropriate antibiotic treatment can significantly reduce mortality from serious bacterial infections (SBI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of five markers of infection: C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), CD163 and high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), as markers of SBI in severely ill Malawian children. Methodology and Principal Findings Children presenting with a signs of meningitis (n = 282) or pneumonia (n = 95), were prospectively recruited. Plasma samples were taken on admission for CRP, PCT, sTREM-1 CD163 and HMGB1 and the performance characteristics of each test to diagnose SBI and to predict mortality were determined. Of 377 children, 279 (74%) had SBI and 83 (22%) died. Plasma CRP, PCT, CD163 and HMGB1 and were higher in HIV-infected children than in HIV-uninfected children (p<0.01). In HIV-infected children, CRP and PCT were higher in children with SBI compared to those with no detectable bacterial infection (p<0.0005), and PCT and CD163 were higher in non-survivors (p = 0.001, p = 0.05 respectively). In HIV-uninfected children, CRP and PCT were also higher in children with SBI compared to those with no detectable bacterial infection (p<0.0005), and CD163 was higher in non-survivors (p = 0.05). The best predictors of SBI were CRP and PCT, and areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.81 (95% CI 0.73–0.89) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.79–0.92) respectively. The best marker for predicting death was PCT, AUC 0.61 (95% CI 0.50–0.71). Conclusions Admission PCT and CRP are useful markers of invasive bacterial infection in severely ill African children. The study of these markers using rapid tests in a less selected cohort would be important in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W2088790289,"Background Aspergillus fumigatus is a common airborne fungal pathogen for humans. It frequently causes an invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients with poor prognosis. Potent antifungal drugs are very expensive and cause serious adverse effects. Their correct application requires an early and specific diagnosis of IA, which is still not properly achievable. This work aims to a specific detection of A. fumigatus by immunofluorescence and the generation of recombinant antibodies for the detection of A. fumigatus by ELISA. Results The A. fumigatus antigen Crf2 was isolated from a human patient with proven IA. It is a novel variant of a group of surface proteins (Crf1, Asp f9, Asp f16) which belong to the glycosylhydrolase family. Single chain fragment variables (scFvs) were obtained by phage display from a human naive antibody gene library and an immune antibody gene library generated from a macaque immunized with recombinant Crf2. Two different selection strategies were performed and shown to influence the selection of scFvs recognizing the Crf2 antigen in its native conformation. Using these antibodies, Crf2 was localized in growing hyphae of A. fumigatus but not in spores. In addition, the antibodies allowed differentiation between A. fumigatus and related Aspergillus species or Candida albicans by immunofluorescence microscopy. The scFv antibody clones were further characterized for their affinity, the nature of their epitope, their serum stability and their detection limit of Crf2 in human serum. Conclusion Crf2 and the corresponding recombinant antibodies offer a novel approach for the early diagnostics of IA caused by A. fumigatus."
https://openalex.org/W1987225288,"The Forkhead Box m1 (Foxm1) protein is induced in a majority of human non-small cell lung cancers and its expression is associated with poor prognosis. However, specific requirements for the Foxm1 in each cell type of the cancer lesion remain unknown. The present study provides the first genetic evidence that the Foxm1 expression in respiratory epithelial cells is essential for lung tumorigenesis. Using transgenic mice, we demonstrated that conditional deletion of Foxm1 from lung epithelial cells (epFoxm1−/− mice) prior to tumor initiation caused a striking reduction in the number and size of lung tumors, induced by either urethane or 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)/butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Decreased lung tumorigenesis in epFoxm1−/− mice was associated with diminished proliferation of tumor cells and reduced expression of Topoisomerase-2α (TOPO-2α), a critical regulator of tumor cell proliferation. Depletion of Foxm1 mRNA in cultured lung adenocarcinoma cells significantly decreased TOPO-2α mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, Foxm1 directly bound to and induced transcription of the mouse TOPO-2α promoter region, indicating that TOPO-2α is a direct target of Foxm1 in lung tumor cells. Finally, we demonstrated that a conditional deletion of Foxm1 in pre-existing lung tumors dramatically reduced tumor growth in the lung. Expression of Foxm1 in respiratory epithelial cells is critical for lung cancer formation and TOPO-2α expression in vivo, suggesting that Foxm1 is a promising target for anti-tumor therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2017165199,"Endothelial phenotypes are highly regulated in space and time by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. There is increasing evidence that the GATA family of transcription factors function as signal transducers, coupling changes in the extracellular environment to changes in downstream target gene expression. Here we show that human primary endothelial cells derived from large blood vessels express GATA2, -3, and -6. Of these factors, GATA3 was expressed at the highest levels. In DNA microarrays of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of GATA3 resulted in reduced expression of genes associated with angiogenesis, including Tie2. At a functional level, GATA3 knockdown inhibited angiopoietin (Ang)-1-mediated but not vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF)-mediated AKT signaling, cell migration, survival, and tube formation. In electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation, GATA3 was shown to bind to regulatory regions within the 5′-untranslated region of the Tie2 gene. In co-immunoprecipitation and co-transfection assays, GATA3 and the Ets transcription factor, ELF1, physically interacted and synergized to transactivate the Tie2 promoter. GATA3 knockdown blocked the ability of Ang-1 to attenuate vascular endothelial cell growth factor stimulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression and monocytic cell adhesion. Moreover, exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to tumor necrosis factor-α resulted in marked down-regulation of GATA3 expression and reduction in Tie2 expression.

Endothelial cell phenotypes are differentially regulated in space and time. Phenotypic changes in the endothelium are mediated, at least in part, by differential activity of transcription factors. The GATA family of transcription factors consists of six members (GATA1 to -6).

Furthermore, we demonstrate that GATA3 is essential for mediating Tie2 expression and Ang-1-Tie2 signaling. These findings implicate an important role for GATA3 in endothelial cell biology. Human recombinant Ang-1 and VEGF were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Thrombin was from Calbiochem. HUVEC, human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVEC), human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells, and human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) were purchased from Clonetics (Clonetics, La Jolla, CA).

Two independent siRNA were generated against GATA-3 3′-untranslated region (oligo1, GCAGGGCAGUAUCAUGAAGCCUAA, and oligo2, GGCAUGAAGGAUGCCAAGAAGUUUA). HUVEC were incubated with a mixture of 40 nm siRNA and Lipofectamine Max (Invitrogen) for 48 h at which time cells were processed for total RNA or for 72 h at which time cells were processed for protein. Human GATA3 was cloned by PCR with total RNA from HUVEC and GATA3-specific primers (sequences are shown in supplemental Table I. GATA3 cDNA was subcloned into pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) and then transferred into the pShuttle and Adeno-X DNA (Clontech) using the Adeno-X adenoviral expression system (Clontech). All cloned and subcloned constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestions and automated DNA sequencing. RNA was harvested from si-control- or si-GATA3-treated HUVEC using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Preparation of cRNA and hybridization of probe arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). File maker software was used to identify genes that demonstrated identical response patterns in the presence of two independent GATA3 siRNAs. Data were analyzed according to the MIAME rule. Annotation of the probe numbers and targeted sequences was based on data available on the Affymetrix web page. Two μg of TRIzol-extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II enzyme and oligo(dT) primer as specified by Invitrogen. Real time PCR, including SYBR Green PCR reagent, was performed on an instrument according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To quantify the mRNA expression levels among GATA family, human GATA1–6 cDNAs were cloned. A titration curve was generated using successively diluted concentrations of cDNA for each GATA factor, normalized for cyclophilin A mRNA levels.

To reduce nonspecific binding, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Invitrogen) was added to the reaction mixture. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow fragment and purified by spin column (Amersham Biosciences). Oligonucleotide sequences used for probes and competitors are shown in supplemental Table I. For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated with monoclonal antibody against GATA3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or IgG for 30 min at room temperature. Recombinant GATA3 were generated using the TnT-coupled Wheat Germ Extract systems (Promega) with pcDNA3-GATA3 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Endothelial cells were exposed to 1% formaldehyde (Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), then scraped, and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and incubated for 10 min. The cross-linked chromatin was subjected to sonication using BioRuptor (Cosmobio, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain DNA fragments of ∼500 bp.

Endothelial cells were treated with si-control or si-GATA3 for 48 h, serum-starved (EBM2 containing 0.5% FBS) for 16 h, and then stimulated 500 ng/ml Ang-1 or 50 ng/ml VEGF for 15 min. Subsequently, cells were lysed with lysis buffer following the manufacturer's protocol (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and then immunoprecipitated with anti-AKT (5G3) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Each sample was separated with 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-AKT (Ser-473) or total AKT antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). For co-immunoprecipitation assays, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pFLAG-ELF1 and pcDNA3-GATA3 expression plasmids using the FuGENE-HD reagent (Roche Applied Science) as instructed by the manufacturer. Two days later, the transfected cells were lysed, and extracts were prepared as described previously (30Minami T. Murakami T. Horiuchi K. Miura M. Noguchi T. Miyazaki J. Hamakubo T. Aird W.C. Kodama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20626-20635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The resulting mixture was incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), washed, and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred to the membrane, which was incubated either with anti-FLAG antibody or anti-GATA3 antibody (R & D Systems). Alternatively, confluent HUVEC (2.5 × 107 cells) were harvested for nuclear extract according to the nitrogen cavitation method to preserve protein-protein associations (30Minami T. Murakami T.

Total nuclear extract was incubated with 30 μg of anti-ELF1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit control IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated samples were separated with 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-GATA3 antibody (R & D Systems) and anti-ELF1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For fibroblast-endothelial cell co-culture, we employed a method previously described by Velazquez et al. (33Velazquez O.C. Snyder R. Liu Z.J. Fairman R.M. Herlyn M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1316-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVEC were treated with siRNA for 24 h and then harvested and fluorescent-labeled with PKH2 (Sigma). Cells were re-seeded in 24-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) containing type I collagen gel (Koken, Tokyo, Japan) and EBM-2 basal media. The resulting mixture was overlaid with a second layer of collagen gel containing 5 × 104 fibroblasts per well. The double-layered sandwich gel was then incubated with 500 μl of EBM-2 in the presence or absence of 500 ng/ml Ang-1 or 50 ng/ml VEGF. Two days later, a branched capillary network was visualized under a fluorescent microscope. Images from at least three different areas in each well were captured and measured by using cell image analyzer (Kurabo, Kyoto, Japan). Endothelial cells were treated with siRNAs for 24 h and then serum-starved and labeled with PKH dye (Sigma). Migration assays were carried out with Biocoat angiogenesis system (BD Biosciences). Fluorescently labeled cells were seeded on the upper chamber (1 × 105 cells/250 μl of EBM-2) and incubated with 750 μl of EBM-2 with or without Ang-1 in the lower chamber. After 24 h, migrated cells were visualized under the fluorescent microscope and quantified with fluorescence detect-cell image analyzer (Kurabo). HUVEC or frozen tissue sections (10 μm) obtained from 8-week-old female mice (C57/BL6j) were fixed and incubated with a rat monoclonal anti-PECAM1 antibody (1:50 dilution) (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) or a goat polyclonal anti-GATA3 antibody (8 μg/ml) (R & D Systems) overnight at 4 °C. Sections were washed three times in PBS and incubated with secondary antibody labeled with Alexa-Fluor 647 (for GATA3) or Alexa-Fluor 488 (for PECAM1) (1:50 dilution) (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed in PBS, mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen), and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Endothelial cells were treated with siRNAs for 24 h and then incubated with EBM-2 basal media (Clonetics) containing 0.5% FBS for 18 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FBS in the presence or absence of Ang-1 for 24 h. Cells were harvested and assayed for annexin V using flow cytometry (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V, BD Biosciences). Alternatively, cells were fixed and processed for TUNEL staining using the VasoTACS in situ apoptosis detection kit (R & D Systems). Monocyte adhesion to HUVEC was assayed as described previously (34Minami T. Miura M. Aird W.C. Kodama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20503-20520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In brief, confluent HUVEC were pretreated with or without 500 ng/ml Ang-1 and then treated with 50 ng/ml VEGF for 6 h. PKH-26 (Sigma)-labeled U937 cells were added to HUVEC-seeded plate. 90 min later, cells were washed and examined by fluorescent microscopy. Data are shown as mean ± S.D. p values were calculated using two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. In DNA microarrays and real time PCR, large vessel endothelial cells (HUVEC, HCAEC, human afferent lymphoid lymphatic endothelial cells, and HPAEC) were shown to express GATA2, GATA3, and GATA6 but not GATA1, GATA4, or GATA5 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. I). To compare mRNA expression levels between the various GATA factors, we generated titration curves with known concentrations of GATA2, -3, and -6 cDNA. GATA3 was expressed at the highest levels, followed by GATA2 and GATA6 (Fig. 1B). In contrast to large vessel endothelial cells, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells demonstrated low levels of GATA3 mRNA (supplemental Fig. I). Consistent with the mRNA data, Western blot analyses of HUVEC revealed higher levels of GATA3 protein (≈10-fold) compared with GATA2 or GATA6 (supplemental Fig. II). In immunohistochemical analyses of HUVEC, GATA3 was localized primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained with HCAEC and HPAEC (not shown). To determine whether GATA3 is expressed in intact endothelium, we carried out immunohistochemical staining of the mouse aorta. Although the background was higher, the GATA3 signal in endothelium was clearly observed in the nuclei of PECAM1-positive endothelial cell layer (arrows in supplemental Fig. III). To determine the functional relevance of GATA3 in endothelial cells, we employed siRNA to knock down expression of the transcription factor in HUVEC. As shown in Fig. 2A, transfection of HUVEC with two independent siRNAs (si-GATA3-a and si-GATA3-b) against GATA3 resulted in 90 and 82% reduction of GATA3 mRNA, respectively, compared with si-control. siRNA treatment also resulted in significant inhibition of GATA3 protein expression (Fig. 2B). To identify potential GATA3 target genes, we carried out DNA microarrays with HUVEC transfected with si-control, si-GATA3-oligo1, or si-GATA3-oligo2. The data were filtered for those genes that were >2.5-fold up-regulated or down-regulated in response to the two independent GATA3 siRNAs, compared with control siRNA. A total of 57 genes were down-regulated and 20 genes up-regulated in GATA3-deficient HUVEC (Fig. 2C). Functional annotation, using Gene Ontology (35Adryan B. Schuh R. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 2851-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), revealed three predominant gene clusters as follows: signaling/transcription, metabolism, and angiogenesis (Fig. 2D). For example, siRNA-mediated knockdown of GATA3 resulted in increased mRNA expression of Ang-like (Angptl)-2 and Ras-derived (RASD)-1 and decreased expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, bone morphogenetic protein-4, endothelin-1, and Tie2. These changes were validated using quantitative real time PCR (supplemental Fig. IV and discussed below). Thus, GATA3 is involved in mediating the expression of functionally relevant target genes in endothelial cells.FIGURE 2siRNA-mediated knockdown of GATA3 in primary human endothelial cells results in altered transcriptional profile.

https://openalex.org/W1969606391,"Background The incidence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infection is rising in the developed world but appears to be rare in developing countries. One explanation for this difference is that resource poor countries lack the diagnostic microbiology facilities necessary to detect the presence of CA-MRSA carriage and infection. Methodology and Principal Findings We developed diagnostic microbiology capabilities at the Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap, western Cambodia in January 2006 and in the same month identified a child with severe community-acquired impetigo caused by CA-MRSA. A study was undertaken to identify and describe additional cases presenting between January 2006 and December 2007. Bacterial isolates underwent molecular characterization using multilocus sequence typing, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, and PCR for the presence of the genes encoding Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL). Seventeen children were identified with CA-MRSA infection, of which 11 had skin and soft tissue infection and 6 had invasive disease. The majority of cases were unrelated in time or place. Molecular characterization identified two independent MRSA clones; fifteen isolates were sequence type (ST) 834, SCCmec type IV, PVL gene-negative, and two isolates were ST 121, SCCmec type V, PVL gene-positive. Conclusions This represents the first ever report of MRSA in Cambodia, spread of which would pose a significant threat to public health. The finding that cases were mostly unrelated in time or place suggests that these were sporadic infections in persons who were CA-MRSA carriers or contacts of carriers, rather than arising in the context of an outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W2075080479,"Thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1), which is contained in platelet alpha-granules and released with activation, has been shown to activate latent TGF-beta1 in vitro, but its in vivo role is unclear as TSP-1-null (Thbs1(-/-)) mice have a much less severe phenotype than TGF-beta1-null (Tgfb1(-/-)) mice. We recently demonstrated that stirring and/or shear could activate latent TGF-beta1 released from platelets and have now studied these methods of TGF-beta1 activation in samples from Thbs1(-/-) mice, which have higher platelet counts and higher levels of total TGF-beta1 in their serum than wild type mice. After either two hours of stirring or shear, Thbs1(-/-) samples demonstrated less TGF-beta1 activation (31% and 54% lower levels of active TGF-beta1 in serum and platelet releasates, respectively). TGF-beta1 activation in Thbs1(-/-) mice samples was normalized by adding recombinant human TSP-1 (rhTSP-1). Exposure of platelet releasates to shear for one hour led to near depletion of TSP-1, but this could be prevented by preincubating samples with thiol-reactive agents. Moreover, replenishing rhTSP-1 to human platelet releasates after one hour of stirring enhanced TGF-beta1 activation. In vivo TGF-beta1 activation in carotid artery thrombi was also partially impaired in Thbs1(-/-) mice. These data indicate that TSP-1 contributes to shear-dependent TGF-beta1 activation, thus providing a potential explanation for the inconsistent in vitro data previously reported as well as for the differences in phenotypes of Thbs1(-/-) and Tgfb1(-/-) mice."

To investigate the in vivo role of NS5A for viral persistence and virus-associated pathogenesis a transgenic (Tg) mouse model was established. Mice with liver-targeted NS5A transgene expression were generated using the albumin promoter. Alterations in the hepatic immune response were determined by Western blot, infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and using transient NS3/4A Tg mice generated by hydrodynamic injection. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity was investigated by the Cr-release assay. The stable NS5A Tg mice did not reveal signs of spontaneous liver disease. The intrahepatic immunity was disrupted in the NS5A Tg mice as determined by clearance of LCMV infection or transiently NS3/4A Tg hepatocytes in vivo. This impaired immunity was explained by a reduced induction of interferon β, 2′,5′-OAS, and PKR after LCMV infection and an impairment of the CTL-mediated elimination of NS3-expressing hepatocytes. In conclusion, these data indicate that in the present transgenic mouse model, NS5A does not cause spontaneous liver disease.

The HCV genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule of ∼9600 bp (1Hoofnagle J.H. Hepatology. 2002; 36: S21-29PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The viral RNA codes for one large polyprotein of ∼3100 amino acids that is post-translationally processed by cellular and viral proteases, leading to the structural proteins core, E1 and E2, the p7 protein, and the non-structural proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (2Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Tanji Y. Komoda Y. Hirowatari Y. Akagi T. Kato N. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 10773-10777Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The mature NS5A protein is generated by the action of the NS3/NS4A serine protease. NS5A is a phosphoprotein that exists in a basal or in a hyperphosphorylated state (p56 and p58) (3Kaneko T. Tanji Y. Satoh S. Hijikata M. Asabe S. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Through an amphipathic α-helix, NS5A is associated with the cytoplasmic face of the ER (4Penin F. Dubuisson J. Rey F.A. Moradpour D. Pawlotsky J.M. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and is an integral part of the replication complex (5Pietschmann T. Lohmann V. Rutter G. Kurpanek K. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1252-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Mutations in NS5A affect the rate of HCV replication suggesting a role of NS5A in modulating viral expression and replication (6Appel N. Pietschmann T. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3187-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Moreover, NS5A is able to interfere with a variety of cellular proteins. Some of these interaction partners, such as Grb2, PI3K, p53, or Raf-1 are important key players in host cell signal transduction, enabling NS5A to deregulate important cellular check points (7Qadri I.

Recent reports even suggest that NS5A may deregulate cell cycle progression by modulating the expression of cell cycle regulatory genes (11Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Meyer K. Ray R. Ray R.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In light of these observations and that it has been suggested to transform murine fibroblasts (12Gale Jr., M. Kwieciszewski B. Dossett M. Nakao H. Katze M.G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6506-6516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is speculated that NS5A could represent an important factor for the development of HCV-associated HCC (13Levrero M.

Infection of transgenic mice expressing the complete HCV polyprotein with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) showed a reduced IFN response and a delayed viral elimination (14Blindenbacher A.

Cell culture-based experiments have shown that NS5A interacts directly with the interferon-dependent induced protein kinase R (PKR), a key player in the cellular antiviral response and that this interaction results in an inhibition of PKR function (15Gale Jr., M.J. Korth M.J. Tang N.M. Tan S.L. Hopkins D.A. Dever T.E. Polyak S.J. Gretch D.R. Katze M.G. Virology. 1997; 230: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Therefore, a role of NS5A for the establishment of a chronic HCV infection by inhibiting the innate immunity is conceivable. To enable in vivo studies of NS5A-specific effects transgenic mice were generated with a liver-specific expression of NS5A. We used these mice to show that NS5A affects both the innate and the adaptive hepatic immunity. The NS5A gene derived from a genotype 1b isolate (GenBankTM accession number D16435) was kindly provided by Dr. Kunitada Shimotohno (Kyoto University, Japan). The coding sequence for an N-terminal His6 tag and a C-terminal V5 epitope was fused to the NS5A coding sequence. The expression was performed under control of the mouse albumin promoter/enhancer (16Brinster R.L. Allen J.M. Behringer R.R. Gelinas R.E. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chromosomal DNA was isolated as described and analyzed by PCR using a β-globin intron-specific forward primer (5′-cgtgctggttattgtgctgtctc-3′) and a NS5A-specific backward primer (5′-attggttgagcccgacctggaatg-3′). A tubulin-specific primer pair was used as control. Glutamyl pyruvic transaminase (GPT) serum levels were determined using the reflotron assay system according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche). The plaque-purified WE strain of LCMV was propagated in NCTC clone 929 L cells. Mice were infected with 105 plaque-forming units (PFU); after 6 and 12 days the livers and spleens of the animals were homogenized, and infectious virus was titrated as PFU in liter cell monolayer cultures (22Bruns M.

After 13 days, 1.8 ml of Ringer solution containing 100 μg of coNS3/4A-pVAX1 were injected intravenously in the tail vein within ∼5–10 s. 72-h posthydrodynamic injection, mice were sacrificed, and liver tissue was taken for Western blot and immunohistochemistry experiments. Chromium release assay was performed as described (26Frelin L. Ahlén G. Alheim M. Weiland O. Barnfield C. Liljeström P. Sällberg M.

The S.E. was used for deviation and for significance analysis Student's test was used (p ≤ 0.05, *; p ≤ 0.01, **; p ≤ 0.001, ***). To calculate the significance of LCMV titer at day 12 p.i. the values for wild-type animals were set as 102, the border of detection limit. RNA was isolated from snap-frozen liver samples derived from three NS5A transgenic 3-month-old mice and three corresponding sex- and age-matched wild-type littermates as described (28Donauer J. Rumberger B. Klein M. Faller D. Wilpert J. Sparna T. Schieren G. Rohrbach R. Dern P. Timmer J. Pisarski P. Kirste G. Walz G. Transplantation. 2003; 76: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Each sample or reference RNA was transcribed into cDNA in the presence of Cy3- or Cy5-labeled dUTP, respectively. Hybridizations were performed in the presence of an equal amount of reference RNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described by Boldrick et al. (29Boldrick J.C. Alizadeh A.A. Diehn M. Dudoit S. Liu C.L.

The microarray results are based on three independent experiments. For RT-PCR analysis RNA was isolated from snap-frozen tissue using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The INFβ-, PKR-, and 2′,5′-OAS-specific RT-PCR was performed as described (30Malmgaard L. Salazar-Mather T.P. Lewis C.A. Biron C.A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4520-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of the corresponding cDNA served in every PCR as a standard. In addition, induction of 2′,5′-OAS and of IFNβ was analyzed by Lightcycler PCR. To study the function of NS5A in vivo, transgenic mice were established that express the NS5A protein in the liver. The schematic structure of the transgene is shown in Fig. 1a. Based on this construct, two independent transgenic lines (01 and 03) were established that had comparable expression levels of NS5A of the expected size (Fig. 1b). The expression of the transgene was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy of liver sections derived from transgenic animals and the respective wild-type littermates using a V5 tag-specific antiserum. As expected for an ER-attached protein, the immunofluorescence microscopy for NS5A showed an inhomogeneous cytoplasmic staining with a concentration in the perinuclear region, while the nucleus remains unstained (Fig. 1c). To verify the liver-specific expression, lysates derived from liver and various other tissues (heart, kidney, spleen, and lung) were analyzed by Western blotting using V5 tag-specific antisera. The Western blot shows that NS5A was solely detectable in the liver-derived lysates, confirming a liver-specific transgene expression (Fig. 1d). To study whether the expression of the transgene was dependent on sex or age, liver-derived lysates from 3–12-month-aged mice were analyzed by Western blotting. The blot shows (i) that the transgene is constitutively expressed and (ii) that the NS5A expression is slightly increased in male mice compared with the female animals (Fig. 1e). To investigate if the transgenic NS5A is functional, we investigated the ability of NS5A to interact with Raf-1 and to mediate increase Raf-1 phosphorylation, similar to reports from cell culture (9Bürckstümmer T. Kriegs M. Lupberger J. Pauli E.K. Schmittel S. Hildt E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We could confirm an interaction of NS5A and Raf-1 with increased phosphorylation/activation of Raf-1 in the transgenic mice. Moreover, consistent with the cell culture experiments, the increased Raf-1 phosphorylation does not result in an activation of MEK/MAP2 kinase (see additional online information). To investigate the effect of NS5A on the gene expression profile, oligonucleotide arrays complementary to 15,000 genes were performed, comparing in independent experiments three transgenic mice to the corresponding three wild-type littermates. Genes that differed in expression levels by 1.5-fold or greater in each comparison, and in all experiments with a p value of less than 0.05 were considered. Based on these parameters, 37 genes could be identified as deregulated by the presence of NS5A. These are presented in Table 1, top and bottom and summarized in Fig. 2, a and b. The observed induction of Serpina 6, Inhibb, Ralbp1, and the repression of TXln, Pcdhga12, and Pdcd10 were confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown). Thus, in these Tg mice, NS5A seems to affect the expression of several genes related to cell proliferation, differentiation, cell-cell contact, apoptosis, and protein degradation.TABLE 1Deregulated gene expression in NS5A transgenic mice determined by microarray analysisFIGURE 2Summary representation of genes affected by NS5A.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3834-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the expression of NS5A is able to induce liver damage such as cirrhosis or HCC, the livers from 31 transgenic mice were analyzed histologically in comparison to their wild-type littermates. Neither in the liver nor in any other organ, could tumors be detected even in the case of mice that were kept up to an age of 17 months. Besides the absence of tumors, there were no other pathological changes detectable such as neoplastic or preneoplastic changes as investigated by histological analysis based on HE and PAS staining (data not shown). Additionally there was no difference in markers for cell proliferation, such as PCNA, and ongoing cell transformation such as altered glycosylation pattern of the cell surface (investigated by lectin staining of paraffin sections) between NS5A transgenic mice and corresponding wild-type littermates. Consistent with previous data (31Majumder M. Steele R. Ghosh A.K. Zhou X.Y. Thornburg L. Ray R. Phillips N.J. Ray R.B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), these data indicate that at least on the genetic background of FVB/N mice, NS5A per se is not sufficient to induce any pathological changes in liver in vivo. To investigate the potential role of NS5A in the establishment of a persistent viral infections in vivo, 12 wild-type and 12 NS5A transgenic mice were infected with 105 PFU LCMV. Six Tg and wild-type animals were sacrificed at days 3, 6 (peak of LCMV infection) 9, or 12 days postinfection, and the LCMV titers in the liver and in the spleen were determined. At days 3 and 6, there was a slightly elevated viral titer in the liver and in the spleen of the transgenic animals. However, at days 9 and 12 a significantly higher viral titer was found in the Tg mice in both the liver and in the spleen compared with the wild-type mice (Fig. 3a). The minor difference in viral titers seen at days 3 and 6 and the major differences seen at days 9 and 12 indicate that virus elimination is impaired by NS5A, but not the susceptibility to infection.FIGURE 3Impaired virus elimination in NS5A transgenic mice. a, NS5A-transgenic mice and the corresponding wild-type littermates were infected with LCMV (WE strain). The virus titer in the liver and spleen was determined 3, 6, 9, and 12 days after infection (22Bruns M. Gessner A. Lother H. Lehmann-Grube F. Virology. 1988; 166: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The data are mean values from 6 animals per group.

Immunol. 1985; 134: 608-615PubMed Google Scholar) and that ultimately leads to severe liver damage. Therefore, the prolonged infection in the transgenics should be associated with ongoing release of liver-specific enzymes. Serum levels of GPT levels were determined in infected animals at days 3, 6, 9, and 12. Fully consistent with the impaired elimination of LCMV in the transgenic animals, in the sera derived from the NS5A transgenic mice, significantly lower GPT levels were found for days 6 and 9 and significantly higher GPT levels were found for day 12 (Fig. 3b). This is in accordance to the persistent elevated amount of T cells in the liver of the NS5A transgenics after 12 days. In wt mice, a reduction in the amount of T cells can be observed after 12 days. T cells were visualized by a CD3-specific antiserum (Fig. 3c). In addition, HE staining of liver tissues from the different time points revealed in the case of the transgenics 12 days after infection, a persistant increased infiltration indicating an ongoing immune response in the case of the NS5A transgenics compared with the wild-type mice (Fig. 3d). Taken together, these data indicate that clearance of LCMV is impaired in NS5A transgenic animals. To test whether an inhibited innate immune response contributes to the delayed virus elimination in the NS5A-Tg mice we analyzed the NS5A-PKR interaction. In cell culture experiments, it has been shown that NS5A (HCV genotype 1b) directly binds to PKR, thereby inhibiting PKR activity (15Gale Jr., M.J. Korth M.J. Tang N.M. Tan S.L. Hopkins D.A. Dever T.E. Polyak S.J. Gretch D.R. Katze M.G. Virology. 1997; 230: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). This is important since PKR is involved in the double-stranded RNA-dependent induction of IFNβ, PKR, and 2′,5′-OAS are induced subsequently by interferon α/β (34Haller O. Kochs G. Weber F. Virology. 2006; 344: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments of liver lysates demonstrated that PKR indeed bound NS5A also in vivo (Fig. 4a). To study the effect of NS5A on the IFN response in greater detail, we analyzed the induction of IFNβ, PKR, and 2′,5′-OAS by RT-PCR and Western blotting at day 6 after infection. RT-PCR analysis showed a strong induction of IFNβ, 2′,5′-OAS and PKR in wild-type mice, and these were all inhibited in the NS5A-Tg mice (Fig. 4b). For IFNβ and 2′,5′-OAS, this was confirmed by Lightcycler PCR (Fig. 4d). Also, Western blotting using 2′,5′-OAS- or PKR-specific antisera showed that the induction of proteins was impaired in NS5A-Tg (Fig. 4c). Taken together, these results suggest that NS5A has a strong inhibitory effect on the innate immune response that contributes to impaired virus elimination. The difference in the viral titers between infected NS5A-Tg and wild-type mice was most pronounced at day 12. Taken into consideration that T-cell response peaks after the first week postinfection (33Lehmann-Grube F. Assmann U. Löliger C. Moskophidis D. Löhler J. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 608-615PubMed Google Scholar), an effect of NS5A on the adaptive immune response may be postulated. To test this possible interference of NS5A with the CTL response, we made the NS5A-Tg mice transiently transgenic also for NS33/4A proteins by hydrodynamic injection. In this model, NS3/4A-expressing liver cells are effectively eliminated by vaccine-primed CTLs (24Ahlen G. Nystrom J. Pult I. Frelin L. Hultgren C. Sallberg M. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 192: 2112-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereby an impaired clearance indicates an effect restricted to CTL function. Thus, NS5A-Tg and wild-type mice were vaccinated with coNS3/4A-DNA, and 13 days later they were all given a hydrodynamic injection of the same coNS3/4A plasmid (26Frelin L. Ahlén G. Alheim M. Weiland O. Barnfield C. Liljeström P. Sällberg M. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Three days later, the mice were sacrificed, and the presence of NS3-expressing cells was determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot (Fig. 5a). This revealed that most NS3/4A-expressing cells were eliminated in the wild-type mice, whereas NS5A-Tg mice had a significantly higher number of NS3-positive hepatocytes. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis of liver lysates, where we also noted that mice with a high level expression of NS5A had the highest levels of NS3 (Fig. 5, b and c). This suggests that a certain amount of NS5A is needed to protect NS3/4A-positive cells from CTL-mediated elimination (Fig. 5c). To exclude that NS5A affects the expression of NS3/4A, pVaxNS3/4a was cotransfected with palbNS5A or with the empty control vector (palb) into HuH7.5 cells. The Western blot analysis revealed that the presence or absence of NS5A does not affect the amount of NS3 (Fig. 5f). Comparable results were obtained after hydrodynamic injection of pVaxNS3/4a in wt and NS5A transgenic mice and subsequent Western blot analysis using an NS3-specific antiserum confirming that NS5A does not affect the amount of NS3. There are two ways by which NS5A could protect NS3/4A-expressing cells from elimination: either to prevent entry of CTLs to the liver or by interfering with one or more of the effector molecule pathways. To investigate whether the entry of CTLs into the liver was affected by NS5A, we monitored hepatic CD3+ cells at the time of elimination by immunohistochemistry. This revealed that comparable amounts of CD3-positive cells were present in wild-type and NS5A-Tg livers. This suggested that NS5A expression did not affect the entry of CTLs into the liver (Fig. 5d). To control the possibility that a reduced effector role of CTLs may cause the impaired elimination of NS3/4A-positive hepatocytes, the lytic activity was determined by a 51Cr-release assay. This revealed a comparable CTL activity in spleens from wild-type and NS5A-Tg mice (Fig. 5e). Taken together, these data indicate that NS5A does not affect entry of T cells into the liver or the activity of CTLs. Thus, this suggests NS5A directly protects the NS3/4A-expressing hepatocytes from elimination by the activated CTLs. The role of NS5A on the molecular level has been well characterized, but much less is known about the relevance of NS5A for HCV-associated pathogenesis or its possible role in viral persistence. To gain more insight regarding these issues, we generated a novel transgenic mouse model that displayed a liver-specific expression of NS5A. There is a variety of reports describing the capacity of NS5A to interact with different cellular proteins and thereby modulate intracellular signal transduction cascades (reviewed in Ref. 35Macdonald A. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether this was reflected by changes in the hepatic gene expression pattern in NS5A-Tg mice. The microarray analysis revealed significant but moderate alterations in 37 genes. At first glance, none of the genes deregulated by NS5A are known to have an obvious association with pathogenic processes. Moreover, promoter analysis of the deregulated genes does not reveal a common pattern of promoter elements shared by NS5A-dependent deregulated genes. Earlier reports on cells stably or transiently producing NS5A of genotype 1b have revealed a variety of genes that are strongly deregulated by NS5A (36Girard S. Vossman E. Misek D.E. Podevin P. Hanash S. Bréchot C. Beretta L. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 708-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, comparing these to the list of genes that were significantly deregulated in NS5A-Tg mice, no overlap was identified. This might be due to the difference of the experimental systems and external factors that seem to affect significantly the expression pattern of NS5A-dependent regulated genes. With respect to the moderate deregulation of gene expression in the NS5A-Tg mice, reflecting an equilibrium between transgene-dependent deregulation and compensatory mechanisms, this did not result in a clear phenotype of the NS5A gt 1a Tg mice (31Majumder M. Steele R. Ghosh A.K. Zhou X.Y. Thornburg L. Ray R. Phillips N.J. Ray R.B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, if this equilibrium between transgene-dependent deregulation and compensatory mechanisms is disturbed. i.e. by a viral infection, the NS5A-transgenics display a clear phenotype. This was demonstrated by impaired clearance of LCMV and reduced induction of 2′,5′-OAS or PKR in LCMV-infected NS5A-Tg mice. Apart from its direct role as an essential part of the replication complex (6Appel N. Pietschmann T. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3187-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 37Penin F. Brass V. Appel N. Ramboarina S. Montserret R. Ficheux D. Blum H.E. Bartenschlager R. Moradpour D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40835-40843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), NS5A can be considered as an important factor that facilitates the establishment or persistence of the HCV infection. The impaired virus elimination in LCMV-infected mice and the delayed elimination of NS3/4A-positive cells after hydrodynamic injection corroborate this. This suggests that two, possibly independent, mechanisms by which NS5A is able to promote the viral infection are described in this study: impairment of the antiviral interferon response (innate immunity) and the interference with the CTL response (adaptive immunity). The binding of NS5A genotype 1b to PKR (15Gale Jr., M.J. Korth M.J. Tang N.M. Tan S.L. Hopkins D.A. Dever T.E. Polyak S.J. Gretch D.R. Katze M.G. Virology. 1997; 230: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) in vivo inhibits PKR that is an essential player for induction and transduction of the interferon-dependent antiviral response (38Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). In accord with this, the LCMV-infected NS5A-Tg mice had a decreased induction of IFNβ, 2′,5′-OAS and PKR, reflecting the inhibitory interference of NS5A with the antiviral interferon response. Many viruses have the potential to interfere with different steps in the antiviral interferon response to escape the host defense system (39Hengel H. Koszinowski U.H. Conzelmann K.K. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 396-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The HCV NS3/4A complex targets MAVS/IPS-1/VISA/Cardif for cleavage as an immune evasion strategy (40Cheng G. Zhong J. Chisari F.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The NS5A-dependent inactivation of PKR could provide an additional escape mechanism from the host antiviral response and thereby favors viral replication and presumably also persistence. The results from the LCMV infection experiments with the NS5A-Tgs identify NS5A as at least one factor that confers reduced viral clearance in LCMV-infected Tg mice expressing the complete HCV genome (14Blindenbacher A. Duong F.H. Hunziker L. Stutvoet S.T. Wang X. Terracciano L. Moradpour D. Blum H.E. Alonzi T. Tripodi M. La Monica N. Heim M.H. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1465-1475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Apart from the effect of NS5A on the innate immune response, the observed NS5A-dependent interference with the CTL response might be an additional factor that confers impaired LCMV elimination in the NS5A-Tgs. The most pronounced differences in LCMV titers were observed after day 6, a time point when T-cell response has been primed. Evidence for the interference of NS5A with the acquired immune response was obtained from the inhibited elimination of NS3/4A-expressing hepatocytes generated by a hydrodynamic injection model. The clearance of NS3-positive cells in this model is exclusively CTL-mediated (24Ahlen G. Nystrom J. Pult I. Frelin L. Hultgren C. Sallberg M. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 192: 2112-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because neither CTL activity nor entry of T cells into the liver was altered in the NS5A-Tg mice, NS5A could exert a protective effect on the liver cell. Since the CTL-dependent clearance is in part mediated by TNFα, the inhibitory effect of NS5A on TNFα-dependent apoptosis (41Majumder M. Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Zhou X.Y. Phillips N.J. Ray R. Ray R.B. Virology. 2002; 294: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) could be relevant. Moreover, one could speculate that NS5A is the molecule that interferes with Fas-mediated apoptosis through Bid as reported from mice expressing the full HCV polyprotein (42Disson O. Haouzi D. Desagher S. Loesch K. Hahne M. Kremer E.J. Jacquet C. Lemon S.M. Hibner U. Lerat H. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 859-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However incubation of primary hepatocytes derived from wt or NS5A transgenic mice with TNFα demonstrated no difference in their sensitivity to TNFα-mediated apoptosis (supplemental Fig. S3). In conclusion, NS5A expression in vivo may help HCV to establish and/or maintain the chronic infection by inhibiting both the innate interferon response and the adaptive CTL response. Considering these new aspects of the relevance of NS5A for the HCV infection could help to find new approaches to prevent the establishment of a chronic HCV infection.

Previously it was shown that a phosphatase and a general kinase inhibitor hamper fructan accumulation. We use various phosphorylation inhibitors both in barley and in Arabidopsis and show that the expression of fructan biosynthetic genes is dependent on PP2A and different kinases such as Tyr-kinases and PI3-kinases. To further characterize the phosphorylation events involved, comprehensive analysis of kinase activities in the cell was performed using a PepChip, an array of >1000 kinase consensus substrate peptide substrates spotted on a chip. Comparison of kinase activities in sugar-stimulated and mock(sorbitol)-treated Arabidopsis demonstrates the altered phosphorylation of many consensus substrates and documents the differences in plant kinase activity upon sucrose feeding. The different phosphorylation profiles obtained are consistent with sugar-mediated alterations in Tyr phosphorylation, cell cycling, and phosphoinositide signaling, and indicate cytoskeletal rearrangements. The results lead us to infer a central role for small GTPases in sugar signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1988260454,"Background Inflammation may lead to tissue injury. We have studied the modulation of inflammatory milieu-induced tissue injury, as exemplified by the mesothelium. Peritoneal dialysis is complicated by peritonitis episodes that cause loss of mesothelium. Proinflammatory cytokines are increased in the peritoneal cavity during peritonitis episodes. However there is scarce information on the modulation of cell death by combinations of cytokines and on the therapeutic targets to prevent desmesothelization. Methodology Human mesothelial cells were cultured from effluents of stable peritoneal dialysis patients and from omentum of non-dialysis patients. Mesothelial cell death was studied in mice with S. aureus peritonitis and in mice injected with tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma. Tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma alone do not induce apoptosis in cultured mesothelial cells. By contrast, the cytokine combination increased the rate of apoptosis 2 to 3-fold over control. Cell death was associated with the activation of caspases and a pancaspase inhibitor prevented apoptosis. Specific caspase-8 and caspase-3 inhibitors were similarly effective. Co-incubation with both cytokines also impaired mesothelial wound healing in an in vitro model. However, inhibition of caspases did not improve wound healing and even impaired the long-term recovery from injury. By contrast, a polymeric nanoconjugate Apaf-1 inhibitor protected from apoptosis and allowed wound healing and long-term recovery. The Apaf-1 inhibitor also protected mesothelial cells from inflammation-induced injury in vivo in mice. Conclusion Cooperation between tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma contributes to mesothelial injury and impairs the regenerative capacity of the monolayer. Caspase inhibition attenuates mesothelial cell apoptosis but does not facilitate regeneration. A drug targeting Apaf-1 allows protection from apoptosis as well as regeneration in the course of inflammation-induced tissue injury."

https://openalex.org/W2015607919,"KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels are the molecular correlates of the neuronal M-channels, which play a major role in the control of neuronal excitability. Notably, they differ from homomeric KCNQ2 channels in their distribution pattern within neurons, with unique expression of KCNQ2 in axons and nerve terminals. Here, combined reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and two-electrode voltage clamp analyses in Xenopus oocytes revealed a strong association of syntaxin 1A, a major component of the exocytotic SNARE complex, with KCNQ2 homomeric channels resulting in a approximately 2-fold reduction in macroscopic conductance and approximately 2-fold slower activation kinetics. Remarkably, the interaction of KCNQ2/Q3 heteromeric channels with syntaxin 1A was significantly weaker and KCNQ3 homomeric channels were practically resistant to syntaxin 1A. Analysis of different KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 chimeras and deletion mutants combined with in-vitro binding analysis pinpointed a crucial C-terminal syntaxin 1A-association domain in KCNQ2. Pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation analyses in hippocampal and cortical synaptosomes demonstrated a physical interaction of brain KCNQ2 with syntaxin 1A, and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed high colocalization of KCNQ2 and syntaxin 1A at presynaptic varicosities. The selective interaction of syntaxin 1A with KCNQ2, combined with a numerical simulation of syntaxin 1A's impact in a firing-neuron model, suggest that syntaxin 1A's interaction is targeted at regulating KCNQ2 channels to fine-tune presynaptic transmitter release, without interfering with the function of KCNQ2/3 channels in neuronal firing frequency adaptation."

We provide the first experimentally-verified compilation of complex I composition in C. elegans, demonstrating 84% conservation with human complex I. Individual subunit contribution to mitochondrial respiratory capacity, holocomplex I assembly, and animal anesthetic behavior was studied in C. elegans by RNA interference-generated knockdown of nuclear genes encoding 28 complex I structural subunits and 2 assembly factors. Not all complex I subunits directly impact respiratory capacity. Subcomplex Iλ subunits along the electron transfer pathway specifically control whole animal anesthetic sensitivity and complex II upregulation, proportionate to their relative impairment of complex I-dependent oxidative capacity. Translational analysis of complex I dysfunction facilitates mechanistic understanding of individual gene contribution to mitochondrial disease. We demonstrate that functional consequences of complex I deficiency vary with the particular subunit that is defective."
https://openalex.org/W2166088819,"Human centromeres are multi-megabase regions of highly ordered arrays of alpha satellite DNA that are separated from chromosome arms by unordered alpha satellite monomers and other repetitive elements. Complexities in assembling such large repetitive regions have limited detailed studies of centromeric chromatin organization. However, a genomic map of the human X centromere has provided new opportunities to explore genomic architecture of a complex locus. We used ChIP to examine the distribution of modified histones within centromere regions of multiple X chromosomes. Methylation of H3 at lysine 4 coincided with DXZ1 higher order alpha satellite, the site of CENP-A localization. Heterochromatic histone modifications were distributed across the 400–500 kb pericentromeric regions. The large arrays of alpha satellite and gamma satellite DNA were enriched for both euchromatic and heterochromatic modifications, implying that some pericentromeric repeats have multiple chromatin characteristics. Partial truncation of the X centromere resulted in reduction in the size of the CENP-A/Cenp-A domain and increased heterochromatic modifications in the flanking pericentromere. Although the deletion removed ∼1/3 of centromeric DNA, the ratio of CENP-A to alpha satellite array size was maintained in the same proportion, suggesting that a limited, but defined linear region of the centromeric DNA is necessary for kinetochore assembly. Our results indicate that the human X centromere contains multiple types of chromatin, is organized similarly to smaller eukaryotic centromeres, and responds to structural changes by expanding or contracting domains."
https://openalex.org/W2075563480,"We report the characterisation of 27 cardiovascular-related traits in 23 inbred mouse strains. Mice were phenotyped either in response to chronic administration of a single dose of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol or under a low and a high dose of the beta-agonist isoproterenol and compared to baseline condition. The robustness of our data is supported by high trait heritabilities (typically H(2)>0.7) and significant correlations of trait values measured in baseline condition with independent multistrain datasets of the Mouse Phenome Database. We then focused on the drug-, dose-, and strain-specific responses to beta-stimulation and beta-blockade of a selection of traits including heart rate, systolic blood pressure, cardiac weight indices, ECG parameters and body weight. Because of the wealth of data accumulated, we applied integrative analyses such as comprehensive bi-clustering to investigate the structure of the response across the different phenotypes, strains and experimental conditions. Information extracted from these analyses is discussed in terms of novelty and biological implications. For example, we observe that traits related to ventricular weight in most strains respond only to the high dose of isoproterenol, while heart rate and atrial weight are already affected by the low dose. Finally, we observe little concordance between strain similarity based on the phenotypes and genotypic relatedness computed from genomic SNP profiles. This indicates that cardiovascular phenotypes are unlikely to segregate according to global phylogeny, but rather be governed by smaller, local differences in the genetic architecture of the various strains."
https://openalex.org/W1998841108,"Pathogenesis in the Rpe65(-/-) mouse model of Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) is characterized by a slow and progressive degeneration of the rod photoreceptors. On the opposite, cones degenerate rapidly at early ages. Retinal degeneration in Rpe65(-/-) mice, showing a null mutation in the gene encoding the retinal pigment epithelium 65-kDa protein (Rpe65), was previously reported to depend on continuous activation of a residual transduction cascade by unliganded opsin. However, the mechanisms of apoptotic signals triggered by abnormal phototransduction remain elusive. We previously reported that activation of a Bcl-2-dependent pathway was associated with apoptosis of rod photoreceptors in Rpe65(-/-) mice during the course of the disease. In this study we first assessed whether activation of Bcl-2-mediated apoptotic pathway was dependent on constitutive activation of the visual cascade through opsin apoprotein. We then challenged the direct role of pro-apoptotic Bax protein in triggering apoptosis of rod and cone photoreceptors.Quantitative PCR analysis showed that increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and decreased level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 were restored in Rpe65(-/-)/Gnat1(-/-) mice lacking the Gnat1 gene encoding rod transducin. Moreover, photoreceptor apoptosis was prevented as assessed by TUNEL assay. These data indicate that abnormal activity of opsin apoprotein induces retinal cell apoptosis through the Bcl-2-mediated pathway. Following immunohistological and real-time PCR analyses, we further observed that decreased expression of rod genes in Rpe65-deficient mice was rescued in Rpe65(-/-)/Bax(-/-) mice. Histological and TUNEL studies confirmed that rod cell demise and apoptosis in diseased Rpe65(-/-) mice were dependent on Bax-induced pathway. Surprisingly, early loss of cones was not prevented in Rpe65(-/-)/Bax(-/-) mice, indicating that pro-apoptotic Bax was not involved in the pathogenesis of cone cell death in Rpe65-deficient mice.This is the first report, to our knowledge, that a single genetic mutation can trigger two independent apoptotic pathways in rod and cone photoreceptors in Rpe65-dependent LCA disease. These results highlight the necessity to investigate and understand the specific death signaling pathways committed in rods and cones to develop effective therapeutic approaches to treat RP diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2058082901,"Background We have recently reported that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) JNK1 downregulates β-catenin signaling and plays a critical role in regulating intestinal homeostasis and in suppressing tumor formation. This study was designed to determine whether JNK2, another MAPK, has similar and/or different functions in the regulation of β-catenin signaling. Methodology and Principal Findings We used an in vitro system with manipulation of JNK2 and β-catenin expression and found that activated JNK2 increased GSK3β activity and inhibited β-catenin expression and transcriptional activity. However, JNK2-mediated downregulation of β-catenin was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and GSK3β inhibitor lithium chloride. Moreover, targeted mutations at GSK3β phosphorylation sites (Ser33 and Ser37) of β-catenin abrogated JNK2-mediated suppression of β-catenin. In vivo studies further revealed that JNK2 deficiency led to upregulation of β-catenin and increase of GSK3-β phosphorylation in JNK2-/- mouse intestinal epithelial cells. Additionally, physical interaction and co-localization among JNK2, β-catenin and GSK3β were observed by immunoprecipitation, mammalian two-hybridization assay and confocal microscopy, respectively. Conclusion and Significance In general, our data suggested that JNK2, like JNK1, interacts with and suppresses β-catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo, in which GSK3β plays a key role, although previous studies have shown distinct functions of JNK1 and JNK2. Our study also provides a novel insight into the crosstalk between Wnt/β-catenin and MAPK JNKs signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2060755685,"Background The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is thought to be overacting in patients with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) reflecting an enhanced action monitoring system. However, influences of conflict and error-likelihood have not been explored. Here, the error-related negativity (ERN) originating in ACC served as a measure of conflict and error-likelihood during memory recognition following different learning modes. Errorless learning prevents the generation of false memory candidates and has been shown to be superior to trial-and-error-learning. The latter, errorful learning, introduces false memory candidates which interfere with correct information in later recognition leading to enhanced conflict processing. Methodology/Principal Findings Sixteen OCD patients according to DSM-IV criteria and 16 closely matched healthy controls participated voluntarily in the event-related potential study. Both, OCD- and control group showed enhanced memory performance following errorless compared to errorful learning. Nevertheless, response-locked data showed clear modulations of the ERN amplitude. OCD patients compared to controls showed an increased error-likelihood effect after errorless learning. However, with increased conflict after errorful learning, OCD patients showed a reduced error-likelihood effect in contrast to controls who showed an increase. Conclusion/Significance The increase of the errorlikelihood effect for OCD patients within low conflict situations (recognition after errorless learning) might be conceptualized as a hyperactive monitoring system. However, within high conflict situations (recognition after EF-learning) the opposite effect was observed: whereas the control group showed an increased error-likelihood effect, the OCD group showed a reduction of the error-likelihood effect based on altered ACC learning rates in response to errors. These findings support theoretical frameworks explaining differences in ACC activity on the basis of conflict and perceived error-likelihood as influenced by individual error learning rate."
https://openalex.org/W2014656919,"In contrast to eukaryotes, most cyanobacteria contain several isoforms of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein, PetC, resulting in heterogeneity in the composition of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complexes. Of three isoforms in the mesophilic cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803, PetC1 is the major Rieske protein in the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex, whereas the physiological function of PetC2 and PetC3 is still uncertain. Comparison of wild type and various <i>petC</i>-deficient strains under selected light conditions revealed distinct functional differences: high-light exposure of wild type cells resulted in a significantly enhanced <i>petC2</i> transcript level, whereas a Δ<i>petC1</i> mutant showed a low cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> content, low electron flux, and a considerably increased accumulation of cytochrome-<i>bd</i> oxidase. In contrast to wild type and Δ<i>petC1</i>, Δ<i>petC2</i> and Δ<i>petC3</i> strains still grew fast under high-light conditions although all three Rieske proteins are required for maximal electron transport rates. Although the presence of PetC3 appears to be required for activation of the cyclic electron transport, state transitions were more effective in the absence of PetC2 and/or PetC3. In summary, our data suggest defined roles of the various PetC proteins in short- and long-term light adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W1988536462,"How space suits affect the preferred walk-run transition is an open question with relevance to human biomechanics and planetary extravehicular activity. Walking and running energetics differ; in reduced gravity (<0.5 g), running, unlike on Earth, uses less energy per distance than walking.The walk-run transition (denoted *) correlates with the Froude Number (Fr = v(2)/gL, velocity v, gravitational acceleration g, leg length L). Human unsuited Fr* is relatively constant (approximately 0.5) with gravity but increases substantially with decreasing gravity below approximately 0.4 g, rising to 0.9 in 1/6 g; space suits appear to lower Fr*. Because of pressure forces, space suits partially (1 g) or completely (lunar-g) support their own weight. We define the Apollo Number (Ap = Fr/M) as an expected invariant of locomotion under manipulations of M, the ratio of human-supported to total transported mass. We hypothesize that for lunar suited conditions Ap* but not Fr* will be near 0.9, because the Apollo Number captures the effect of space suit self-support. We used the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal and other sources to identify 38 gait events during lunar exploration for which we could determine gait type (walk/lope/run) and calculate Ap. We estimated the binary transition between walk/lope (0) and run (1), yielding Fr* (0.36+/-0.11, mean+/-95% CI) and Ap* (0.68+/-0.20).The Apollo Number explains 60% of the difference between suited and unsuited Fr*, appears to capture in large part the effects of space suits on the walk-run transition, and provides several testable predictions for space suit locomotion and, of increasing relevance here on Earth, exoskeleton locomotion. The knowledge of how space suits affect gait transitions can be used to optimize space suits for use on the Moon and Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2048323513,"Clinical management of malaria is a major health issue in sub-Saharan Africa. New strategies based on intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) can tackle disease burden by simultaneously reducing frequency of infections and life-threatening illness in infants (IPTi) and children (IPTc), while allowing for immunity to build up. However, concerns as to whether immunity develops efficiently in treated individuals, and whether there is a rebound effect after treatment is halted, have made it imperative to define the effects that IPTi and IPTc exert on the clinical malaria scenario.Here, we simulate several schemes of intervention under different transmission settings, while varying immunity build up assumptions. Our model predicts that infection risk and effectiveness of acquisition of clinical immunity under prophylactic effect are associated to intervention impact during treatment and follow-up periods. These effects vary across regions of different endemicity and are highly correlated with the interplay between the timing of interventions in age and the age dependent risk of acquiring an infection. However, even when significant rebound effects are predicted to occur, the overall intervention impact is positive.IPTi is predicted to have minimal impact on the acquisition of clinical immunity, since it does not interfere with the occurrence of mild infections, thus failing to reduce the underlying force of infection. On the contrary, IPTc has a significant potential to reduce transmission, specifically in areas where it is already low to moderate."
https://openalex.org/W2082591386,"Legume plants form beneficial symbiotic interactions with nitrogen fixing bacteria (called rhizobia), with the rhizobia being accommodated in unique structures on the roots of the host plant. The legume/rhizobial symbiosis is responsible for a significant proportion of the global biologically available nitrogen. The initiation of this symbiosis is governed by a characteristic calcium oscillation within the plant root hair cells and this signal is activated by the rhizobia. Recent analyses on calcium time series data have suggested that stochastic effects have a large role to play in defining the nature of the oscillations. The use of multiple nonlinear time series techniques, however, suggests an alternative interpretation, namely deterministic chaos. We provide an extensive, nonlinear time series analysis on the nature of this calcium oscillation response. We build up evidence through a series of techniques that test for determinism, quantify linear and nonlinear components, and measure the local divergence of the system. Chaos is common in nature and it seems plausible that properties of chaotic dynamics might be exploited by biological systems to control processes within the cell. Systems possessing chaotic control mechanisms are more robust in the sense that the enhanced flexibility allows more rapid response to environmental changes with less energetic costs. The desired behaviour could be most efficiently targeted in this manner, supporting some intriguing speculations about nonlinear mechanisms in biological signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2000664434,"VILIP-1 (gene name VSNL1), a member of the neuronal Ca2+ sensor protein family, acts as a tumor suppressor gene by inhibiting cell proliferation, adhesion, and invasiveness. VILIP-1 expression is down-regulated in several types of human cancer. In human non-small cell lung cancer, we found that down-regulation was due to epigenetic changes. Consequently, in this study we analyzed the VSNL1 promoter and its regulation. Serial truncation of the proximal 2-kb VSNL1 promoter (VP-1998) from its 5′ terminus disclosed that the last 3′ terminal 100-bp promoter fragment maintained similar promoter activity as compared with VP-1998 and therefore was referred to as VSNL1 minimal promoter. When the 5′ terminal 50 bp were deleted from the minimal promoter, the activity was dramatically decreased, suggesting that the deleted 50 bp contained a potential cis-acting element crucial for promoter activity. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis combined with in silico transcription factor binding analysis of VSNL1 promoter identified nuclear respiratory factor (NRF)-1/α-PAL as a major player in regulating VSNL1 minimal promoter activity. The function of NRF-1 was further confirmed using dominant-negative NRF-1 overexpression and NRF-1 small interfering RNA knockdown. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation provided evidence for direct NRF-1 binding to the VSNL1 promoter.

Linke B. Heinemann U. Braunewell K.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis in both nervous tissue and non-neural tissues. Recently, VILIP-1 was found to be expressed in insulin-expressing pancreatic β-cells and glucagon-expressing α-cells (7Dai F.F. Zhang Y. Kang Y. Wang Q. Gaisano H.Y. Braunewell K.H. Chan C.B.

Similarly, VILIP-1 expression is present in normal squamous epithelium of esophagus and bronchial mucociliary epithelium. Conversely VILIP-1 was down-regulated in squamous cell carcinomas from these two sites (10Wickborn C. Klein-Szanto A.J. Schlag P.M. Braunewell K.H. Mol.

Despite the recent reports that highlight the role of VILIP-1 in physiological and pathological processes, the molecular mechanisms controlling its expression remain unknown. Recently, we reported the cloning of a 2-kb VSNL1 promoter from the 5′-untranslated region of the gene (11Fu J. Fong K. Bellacosa A. Ross E. Apostolou S. Bassi D.E. Jin F. Zhang J. Cairns P. Ibañez de Caceres I. Braunewell K.H. Klein-Szanto A.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The VSNL1 2-kb promoter contains two CpG islands that are the targets of methylation modification, constituting one of the epigenetic mechanisms contributing to the silencing of VSNL1 gene expression in lung and other cancer cells. Increased acetylation of histones 3 and 4 around the VSNL1 promoter by the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, released the inhibition of gene expression, thus leading to the reactivation of VSNL1 expression (11Fu J. Fong K. Bellacosa A. Ross E. Apostolou S. Bassi D.E. Jin F. Zhang J. Cairns P. Ibañez de Caceres I. Braunewell K.H. Klein-Szanto A.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To further understand VSNL1 gene regulation and identify the transcriptional elements of the human VSNL1 promoter, we characterized the 2-kb VSNL1 promoter by deletion, mutation, and in vitro DNA binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Using dominant-negative construct transfection and siRNA knockdown techniques, we identified Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) as a major trans-acting element regulating VSNL1 promoter. In addition, we found that NRF-1 could be the regulatory factor for the promoters of all the other visinin-like subfamily genes. Two non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, NCI-H522 and NCI-H520, which express different levels of VILIP-1, and normal human bronchial epithelial cells were cultured as previously described (11Fu J. Fong K. Bellacosa A. Ross E. Apostolou S. Bassi D.E. Jin F. Zhang J. Cairns P. Ibañez de Caceres I. Braunewell K.H. Klein-Szanto A.J.

VP-1998 (VP2kb) was constructed as described (11Fu J. Fong K. Bellacosa A. Ross E. Apostolou S. Bassi D.E. Jin F. Zhang J. Cairns P. Ibañez de Caceres I. Braunewell K.H. Klein-Szanto A.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All of the deletion constructs of VSNL1 promoter were derived from VP-1998 by PCR using the same reverse primer: 5′-GAAGATCTGCAGATTGGGAATCCCATAG. The forward primers were as follows: for VP-354, 5′-GGGGTACCAGGTTCGGTAACCACTGGG; for VP-174, 5′-GGGGTACCTGCGCCATCGCCAGGCG; for VP-100, 5′-GGGGTACCAAGAGAGGAAAGGGGAGGG; for VP-90 5′-GGGGTACCAGGGGAGGGGGTGCCTG; for vp-80, 5′-GGGGTACCGTGCCTGGAGAGGCGGAG; for VP-70, 5′-GGGGTACCAGGCGGAGGCTCGCGCG; for VP-60, 5′-GGGGTACCTCGCGCGCCTGCGCATC; and for VP-50, 5′-GGGGTACCGCGCATCCAGCTCCAGGG. For VP-100 and VP-90 containing Sp1 mutations and VP-60 containing NRF-1 mutation, the same reverse primer as above was used. The forward primers were: for VP-100Sp1m, 5′-GGGGTACCAATTTAGGAAAGGGGAGGGGGTG; for VP-90Sp1m, 5′-GGGGTACCAGTTTAGGGGGTGCCTGGAGAGG; and for VP-60NRFm, 5′-GGGGTACCTCGCGCGGCATTCCATCCAGCTCC. The PCR products were digested with KpnI and BglII and then inserted into pGL4.10 basic vector. VP-174NRFm, in which the NRF-1-binding site was mutated, was made by using QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following primers: forward, 5′-GGCGGAGGCTCGCGCGGCATTCCATCCAGCTCCAGGG; and reverse, 5′-CCCTGGAGCTGGATGGAATGCCGCGCGAGCCTCCGCC. The underlined bases were mutated within NRF-1 sites. All of the constructs had been verified by DNA sequencing. The expression plasmid of DN NRF-1 was constructed according to Chang and Huang (12Chang W.T. Huang A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14542-14550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The DN NRF-1 consisted of the first N-terminal 304 residues of NRF-1, which contained the DNA-binding and nuclear localization domains and lacked the transactivation domain. DN NRF-1 cDNA was amplified from RNA extracted from normal human bronchial epithelial cells by using the SuperScript One-Step reverse transcription-PCR system (Invitrogen). The following primers were used: 5′-TTAAGCTTGCGCAGCCGCTCTGAGAAC and 5′-GACTCGAGTCACTGTGATGGTACAAGATGAGC. The underlined regions indicate the restriction enzyme sites. The cDNA fragments were digested with HindIII and XhoI and inserted into pcDNA3.1B+Myc vector (Invitrogen) to make pCDNA3.1 Myc-DN-NRF-1. The transfection of this construct resulted in the expression of Myc-tagged DN NRF-1 (therefore named Myc-DN-NRF-1). For all experiments, the cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocol. For reporter gene assay, DNA mixture containing 0.8 μg of VSNL1 promoter constructs and 8 ng of pGL4.73, a transfection efficiency control, was diluted in 50 μl of Opti-Mem I medium (Invitrogen) and mixed with 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 diluted in 50 μl of Opti-Mem I medium. 100 μl of DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complexes were added to each well of 24-well plates after 20 min of incubation at room temperature, and the transfected cells were left in the incubator for 24 h before the lysis step with 150 μl of passive lysis buffer. Reporter gene activity was measured in 96-well plates according to the protocol from Dual-Luciferase reporter 1000 assay system kit (Promega) by using an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For assessing the effect of DN NRF-1 on VSNL1 promoter activity, different amounts of pCDNA3.1 Myc-DN-NRF-1 or vector were co-transfected with 0.8 μg of pGL4.10 VP-174 and 8 ng of pGL4.73, and luciferase activity was measured in 1 or 2 days. For siRNA transfections, NRF-1 siRNA (SC-38105) and scrambled control siRNA (SC-37007) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Different amounts of NRF-1 siRNA were tested for knocking down NRF-1 protein, and 50 pmol was finally used in the reporter gene assay with 0.8 μg of VP-174 and 8 ng of pGL4.73 in 24-well plate. Luciferase activity was measured in 3 days. For immunoblot analysis of VILIP-1 protein after NRF-1 knockdown, scrambled (D-001810-10-05) and NRF-1 (L-017924-00-0005) siRNAs from Thermo SCIENTIFIC were also used. All of the data were obtained from at least three individual experiments. Nuclear proteins were extracted from cells using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) according to the protocol provided by the company. The following NRF-1 oligonucleotides were used: forward, 5′-TCGCGCGCCTGCGCATCCAG, and reverse, 5′-GCTGGATGCGCAGGCGCGCG; for methylated NRF-1 M1: forward, 5′ TCGCMetGCMetGCCTGCMetGCATCCAG, and reverse, 5′-GCTGGATGCMetGCAGGCMetGCMetGCG; and for methylated NRF-1 M2: forward, 5′-TCGCGCMetGCCTGCMetGCATCCAG, and reverse, 5′-GCTGGATGCMetGCAGGCMetGCGCG. CMet represents the methylated cytosine. The equal volumes of the forward and reverse oligonucleotides with the same molar concentration were mixed and boiled for 10 min and were annealed at room temperature overnight. The probe labeling and EMSA were performed using a gel shift assay system (Promega). Briefly, the annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase before purification with Microspin G-25 columns (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). The DNA binding was conducted at 4 °C for 30 min in a mixture containing 5 μg of nuclear extract, 1× gel shift binding buffer, and 1 μl of 32P-labeled probe. In the competition experiment, 60× unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were used as competitors and incubated with nuclear extract and binding buffer for 30 min before the addition of 32P-labeled probe. The reactions were further incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. In supershift assays, the antibodies were also incubated with the reaction mixture at 4 °C for 30 min before the addition of the 32P-labeled probe. Anti-NRF-1 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Claude Piantadosi (13Piantadosi C.A. Suliman H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10967-10977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Dr. Kimitoshi Kohno (14Izumi H. Ohta R. Nagatani G. Ise T. Nakayama Y. Nomoto M. Kohno K. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 713-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The control sc2025 mouse IgG was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Finally the reaction mixtures were analyzed on a 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen) at 10 v/cm on ice for 1.5 h. The gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. ChIP was performed as before (11Fu J. Fong K. Bellacosa A. Ross E. Apostolou S. Bassi D.E. Jin F. Zhang J. Cairns P. Ibañez de Caceres I. Braunewell K.H. Klein-Szanto A.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the proteins were cross-linked to DNA by incubating 1 × 106 cells with 1% formaldehyde for 2.5 or 10 min at 37 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer followed by DNA sonication for a total of 16 times (each time for 20 s at 30% of maximal power) by using the Ultrasonic Processor (Cole Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL). Immunocomplexes were captured from the rest of the lysates with 10 μg of antibody. After the cross-linking was reversed by heating the sample at 65 °C for 4 h, DNA was then extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. PCR was performed by using 1% of immunoprecipitated material and the same primers as used before (11Fu J. Fong K. Bellacosa A. Ross E. Apostolou S. Bassi D.E. Jin F. Zhang J. Cairns P. Ibañez de Caceres I. Braunewell K.H. Klein-Szanto A.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The following PCR program was used: 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35–40 cycles of 95 °C for 35 s, 54 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 40 s, and finally 72 °C for 10 min. Rabbit anti-NRF-1 serum was kindly provided by D. Reines (15Smith K.T. Coffee B. Reines D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology include: normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027), MBD4 (sc-10753), HDAC1 (sc-7872 X), HDAC2 (sc-7899 X), and HDAC3 (sc-11417 X). Antibodies against four MBP family proteins were from Abcam, including MBD1 (ab3753), MBD2a (ab3754), MBD3 (ab3755), and MeCP2 (ab3752). Anti-human α1-antitrypsin rabbit serum (A0409) was from Sigma. The promoter-specific methylation of VSNL1 was performed according to a published protocol (11Fu J. Fong K. Bellacosa A. Ross E. Apostolou S. Bassi D.E. Jin F. Zhang J. Cairns P. Ibañez de Caceres I. Braunewell K.H. Klein-Szanto A.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this case we used HhaI DNA methyltransferase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) in the methylation-modifying treatment. VP-100 was used because it contains the NRF-1 site, which is the only target site within VP-100 for HhaI DNA methyltransferase. The HhaI methylation of the whole plasmids pGL4.10 and pGL4.10VP-100 was done as follows: 20 μg of plasmids was treated with HhaI DNA methyltransferase in the presence or absence of S-adenosylmethionine and gel-purified by using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The complete methylation of VP-100 or plasmids was confirmed by digestion with HhaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs). The modified plasmids were co-transfected with pGL4.73 as described above. Immunoblotting analysis of protein was performed as described (11Fu J. Fong K. Bellacosa A. Ross E. Apostolou S. Bassi D.E. Jin F. Zhang J. Cairns P. Ibañez de Caceres I. Braunewell K.H. Klein-Szanto A.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The expression of DN NRF-1 was detected by using 25 μg of nuclear proteins and anti-Myc antibody (R950-25; Invitrogen). NRF-1 anti-serum (15Smith K.T. Coffee B. Reines D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. D. Reines (Emory University, Atlanta, GA) and used to detect NRF-1 protein. The fragments containing the potential NRF-1-binding site were amplified by PCR using the following primers. For NCALD, the forward primer is 5′-GGGGTACCACCATCTGGAATGGGAGTTG; and the reverse primer is 5′-GAAGATCTAGTATGCTGTGGCACAAACG. For HPCA, the forward primer is 5′-GGGGTACCTGAGGGCGTCCCCTTCTC; and the reverse primer is 5′-GAAGATCTGACTGCGCAGGGAAGGCG. For HPCAL4, the forward primer is 5′-GGGGTACCGCAGAGATGTGGACTGCTG; and the reverse primer is 5′-GAAGATCTCCGGTGGGTTTGTTGC. For HPCAL2, the forward primer is 5′-GGGGTACCCTGGCCCCTCCCGGGC; and the reverse primer is 5′- GAAGATCTGCAAAGAGCCGGATCGCAG. The fragments were subsequently subcloned to pGL4.10[luc2] vector. Transcription factor binding sites were searched by using the following programs: TESS (Current Protocols in Bioinformatics), AliBaBa2.1 (Biostatics and Bioinformatics Facility, Fox Chase Cancer Center), and MatInspector (Genomatix). For comparing the relative activity of different reporter constructs, unpaired Student's t test for paired comparisons was performed, and a p value <0.05 was considered as significant. In our previous study, we had cloned a 2-kb fragment of VSNL1 promoter (VP-1998) from normal human bronchial epithelial cells and showed that its regulation by epigenetic mechanisms included promoter hypermethylation and histone acetylation (11Fu J. Fong K. Bellacosa A. Ross E. Apostolou S. Bassi D.E. Jin F. Zhang J. Cairns P. Ibañez de Caceres I. Braunewell K.H. Klein-Szanto A.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To define the boundaries of the minimal promoter and to identify cis elements that govern the transcriptional activity of VSNL1, we prepared a series of truncation constructs (Fig. 1A) and tested them in a transient luciferase reporter system. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), VP-354 was observed to have stronger transcriptional activity than VP-1998 in two non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H522 and NCI-H520), indicating that putative negative cis-acting regulatory elements are located between the −1998 and −354. A 5′-deletion of 180 bp (VP-174) reduced promoter activity to the level comparable with that of VP-1998 in NCI-H522 cells. However, in the other non-small cell lung cancer cell line (NCI-H520), the reduction of activity was not as remarkable as in NCI-H522 cells. Further deletion of 74 bp from VP-174 caused a 14% decrease in activity when using NCI-H522 cells. In contrast, a 37% increase in activity was noted with NCI-H520 cells. VP-50 containing only the last 50 bp displayed the lowest luciferase activity in both cell lines. Its activity was 4 and 35% of VP-1998 in NCI-H522 and NCI-H520 cells, respectively, strongly indicating that the region from VP-100 to VP-50 is critical to VSNL1 promoter activity. To further examine which part within the truncated 50 bp could sustain transcriptional activity, we designed 10-bp stepwise deletion constructs (Fig. 1D) and tested them in the same assay system. The stepwise 10-bp deletion caused a gradual loss of promoter activity, and VP-60 still maintained 26 and 43% of VP-100 activity in NCI-H522 and NCI-H520, respectively (Fig. 1, E and F). Nevertheless, removal of 10 bp from VP-60 dramatically decreased the activity to 6 and 14% of VP-100 in NCI-H522 and NCI-H520 cells, respectively. We searched the sequence of VP-100 for homology to known regulatory elements by using the TESS, AliBaBa2.1, and MatInspector bioinformatics programs. There were a number of putative binding sites for transcriptional factors in this region (Fig. 2), among which Sp1 and NRF-1 were frequently identified. Combining this in silico analysis with the result from the 10-bp stepwise deletion experiment, it could be concluded that the first Sp1 site was located between VP-100 and VP-90 and the second Sp1 site was located between VP-90 and VP-80 and that a NRF-1 site spanning between VP-60 and VP-40 could have regulatory effect on VSNL1 promoter activity. To confirm these findings, we introduced point mutations to the sites and tested the mutant constructs in both cell lines (Fig. 3A). Comparable with the 10-bp stepwise deletion results, mutation of two Sp1 sites demonstrated that these sites played a positive regulatory role in VSNL1 transcription activity (Fig. 3, B and C). The putative NRF-1 site in the VSNL1 promoter is an 11-base tandem repeat sequence, GCGCCTGCGCA. When the core CCTGCG was replaced by GCATTC, an 80 and 74% drop in promoter activity was observed as compared with intact VP-60 in NCI-H522 and NCI-H520 cells, respectively. The effect of mutation of the NRF-1-binding site was further verified in a longer VSNL1 promoter setting (VP-174). This mutation caused a 69% decrease of VP-174 activity in NCI-H522 cells and a 44% decrease in NCI-H520 cells. These results suggested that the NRF-1-binding sequence is a very important regulatory element in the VSNL1 promoter.FIGURE 3Deletion and mutation analyses of NRF-1 and Sp1 sites within the VSNL1 gene promoter. A, schematic representation of the VSNL1 promoter and mutant constructs. The filled boxes represent Sp1- and NRF-1-binding sites, respectively. The × symbols on VP-100 and VP-90 indicate where the Sp1 sites were mutated in VP-100 and VP-90. The × symbols on VP-60 and VP-174 indicate where the NRF-1 sites were mutated in VP-60 and VP-174, respectively. B and C, VSNL1 wild type and mutant plasmids were transfected into NCI-H522 and NCI-H520 cells. The luciferase activity was normalized to VP-100 (upper panel) and VP-174 (lower panel). Note that the mutation of NRF-1 site resulted in a pronounced decrease in promoter activity (∼80%) relative to VP-60.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The requirement of NRF-1 for effective VSNL1 promoter activity was verified by co-transfection of the Myc-tagged DN NRF-1 expression vector with VP-174 reporter construct. Overexpression of Myc-DN-NRF-1, containing only the N-terminal DNA-binding and nuclear localization domains, should compete with the binding of endogenous NRF-1 to the NRF-1-binding site on the VSNL1 promoter and therefore interrupt the activating function of endogenous NRF-1 because it does not contain the C-terminal transactivation domain. As shown in Fig. 4(A and B), the VP-174 activity was inhibited upon the expression of Myc-DN-NRF-1, exhibiting ∼64 and 84% inhibition (0.8 μg) in NCI-H522 and NCI-H520 cells, respectively. The expression of Myc-DN-NRF-1 was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 4C). The second evidence for NRF-1 regulation of the VSNL1 promoter was obtained by NRF-1 siRNA treatment. Transfection of 50 pmol of NRF-1 siRNA resulted in a strong inhibition of NRF-1 protein synthesis as compared with that of scrambled siRNA control (Fig. 5A). When the same amount of NRF-1 siRNA was co-transfected with VP-174, an approximately 90% reduction in promoter activity in both cell lines was observed (Fig. 5B). In addition, the essential requirement of NRF-1 for VILIP-1 transcription was corroborated by the observation that NRF-1 silencing led to a significant down-regulation of VILIP-1 protein (Fig. 5C).FIGURE 5NRF-1 is required for VILIP-1 expression. A, knockdown of NRF-1 expression. NRF-1 siRNA (50 pmol) or the same amount of scrambled control siRNA was transfected, and the cells were lysed in 3 days. NRF-1 was detected with anti-NRF-1 antibody, and equal loading of total protein was demonstrated by Western blot analysis of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. B, VSNL1 promoter activity was suppressed by down-regulation of NRF-1. NRF-1 siRNA (50 pmol) or the same amount of scrambled control siRNA was co-transfected with pGL4.10 VP-174 reporter. Luciferase activity was assayed in 3 days and normalized to scrambled control for both cell lines. C, suppression of VILIP-1 expression by NRF-1 silencing. Either scrambled or NRF-1 siRNA was transfected into NCI-H520 cells, and the expression of NRF-1, VILIP-1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was analyzed 3 days post-transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the NRF-1 sequence is effectively recognized by cellular NRF-1 protein, we performed EMSA with the nuclear proteins extracted from NCI-H520 cells. Two major bands were observed (Fig. 6A, lane 2) that were abolished by cold (unlabeled) NRF-1 oligonucleotides (lane 3), indicating that these DNA-protein complexes contain proteins able to recognize and bind to the NRF-1 response element. The upper band represented the major NRF-1-containing DNA-protein complex because it was specifically supershifted by using two different NRF-1 antibodies from Drs. Claude Piantadosi and Kimitoshi Kohno, respectively (lanes 4 and 5), whereas the control antibody was unable to supershift it (lane 6). To determine the in vivo occupancy of the VSNL1 promoter by NRF-1, we performed a ChIP assay. As negative controls, a normal rabbit IgG and a nonrelated anti-α1-trypsin antiserum were included for immunoprecipitation using the same batch of cell lysates as used in NRF-1 antibody immunoprecipitation. The VSNL1 promoter was co-immunoprecipitated only with NRF-1 antibody (Fig. 6B), indicating the specific binding of VSNL1 promoter by NRF-1 in vivo. Methylation is one of the major epigenetic mechanisms governing VSNL1 gene expression (11Fu J. Fong K. Bellacosa A. Ross E. Apostolou S. Bassi D.E. Jin F. Zhang J. Cairns P. Ibañez de Caceres I. Braunewell K.H. Klein-Szanto A.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Methylation of all the CpG islands in VP-1998 with M.SssI treatment nearly abolished VSNL1 promoter activity (decreased to 11%) (11Fu J. Fong K. Bellacosa A. Ross E. Apostolou S. Bassi D.E. Jin F.

Within VP-100, the NRF-1-binding site is the only sequence containing two GCGC sequences. To further study the epigenetic regulation of VSNL1 expressi"
https://openalex.org/W1964146213,"Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease. Although no protein coding gene defects have been reported in SRS patients, approximately 50% of SRS patients carry epimutations (hypomethylation) at the IGF2/H19 imprinting control region 1 (ICR1). Proper methylation at ICR1 is crucial for the imprinted expression of IGF2, a fetal growth factor. CTCFL, a testis-specific protein, has recently been proposed to play a role in the establishment of DNA methylation at the murine equivalent of ICR1. A screen was undertaken to assess whether CTCFL is mutated in SRS patients with hypomethylation, to explore a link between the observed epimutations and a genetic cause of the disease.DNA was obtained from 36 SRS patients with hypomethylation at ICR1. All CTCFL coding exons were sequenced and analyzed for duplications/deletions using both multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, with a custom CTCFL probe set, and genomic qPCR. Novel SNP alleles were analyzed for potential differential splicing in vitro utilizing a splicing assay. Neither mutations of CTCFL nor duplications/deletions were observed. Five novel SNPs were identified and have been submitted to dbSNP. In silico splice prediction suggested one novel SNP, IVS2-66A>C, activated a cryptic splice site, resulting in aberrant splicing and premature termination. In vitro splicing assays did not confirm predicted aberrant splicing.As no mutations were detected at CTCFL in the patients examined, we conclude that genetic alterations of CTCFL are not responsible for the SRS hypomethylation. We suggest that analysis of other genes involved in the establishment of DNA methylation at imprinted genes, such as DNMT3A and DNMT3L, may provide insight into the genetic cause of hypomethylation in SRS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2083159991,"There is considerable interest in the hypothesis that low frequency, intermediate penetrance variants contribute to the proportion of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) susceptibility not attributable to the common variants uncovered through genome-wide association approaches. Genes previously implicated in monogenic and multifactorial forms of diabetes are obvious candidates in this respect. In this study, we focussed on exons 8-10 of the HNF1A gene since rare, penetrant mutations in these exons (which are only transcribed in selected HNF1A isoforms) are associated with a later age of diagnosis of Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) than mutations in exons 1-7. The age of diagnosis in the subgroup of HNF1A-MODY individuals with exon 8-10 mutations overlaps with that of early multifactorial T2D, and we set out to test the hypothesis that these exons might also harbour low-frequency coding variants of intermediate penetrance that contribute to risk of multifactorial T2D.We performed targeted capillary resequencing of HNF1A exons 8-10 in 591 European T2D subjects enriched for genetic aetiology on the basis of an early age of diagnosis (< or =45 years) and/or family history of T2D (> or =1 affected sibling). PCR products were sequenced and compared to the published HNF1A sequence. We identified several variants (rs735396 [IVS9-24T>C], rs1169304 [IVS8+29T>C], c.1768+44C>T [IVS9+44C>T] and rs61953349 [c.1545G>A, p.T515T] but no novel non-synonymous coding variants were detected.We conclude that low frequency, nonsynonymous coding variants in the terminal exons of HNF1A are unlikely to contribute to T2D-susceptibility in European samples. Nevertheless, the rationale for seeking low-frequency causal variants in genes known to contain rare, penetrant mutations remains strong and should motivate efforts to screen other genes in a similar fashion."
