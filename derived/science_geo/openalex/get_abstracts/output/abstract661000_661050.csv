https://openalex.org/W3092621662,"Nitrous oxide (N2O), like carbon dioxide, is a long-lived greenhouse gas that accumulates in the atmosphere. Over the past 150 years, increasing atmospheric N2O concentrations have contributed to stratospheric ozone depletion1 and climate change2, with the current rate of increase estimated at 2 per cent per decade. Existing national inventories do not provide a full picture of N2O emissions, owing to their omission of natural sources and limitations in methodology for attributing anthropogenic sources. Here we present a global N2O inventory that incorporates both natural and anthropogenic sources and accounts for the interaction between nitrogen additions and the biochemical processes that control N2O emissions. We use bottom-up (inventory, statistical extrapolation of flux measurements, process-based land and ocean modelling) and top-down (atmospheric inversion) approaches to provide a comprehensive quantification of global N2O sources and sinks resulting from 21 natural and human sectors between 1980 and 2016. Global N2O emissions were 17.0 (minimum-maximum estimates: 12.2-23.5) teragrams of nitrogen per year (bottom-up) and 16.9 (15.9-17.7) teragrams of nitrogen per year (top-down) between 2007 and 2016. Global human-induced emissions, which are dominated by nitrogen additions to croplands, increased by 30% over the past four decades to 7.3 (4.2-11.4) teragrams of nitrogen per year. This increase was mainly responsible for the growth in the atmospheric burden. Our findings point to growing N2O emissions in emerging economies-particularly Brazil, China and India. Analysis of process-based model estimates reveals an emerging N2O-climate feedback resulting from interactions between nitrogen additions and climate change. The recent growth in N2O emissions exceeds some of the highest projected emission scenarios3,4, underscoring the urgency to mitigate N2O emissions."
https://openalex.org/W3092538588,"Spinal cord injury in mammals is thought to trigger scar formation with little regeneration of axons1–4. Here we show that a crush injury to the spinal cord in neonatal mice leads to scar-free healing that permits the growth of long projecting axons through the lesion. Depletion of microglia in neonatal mice disrupts this healing process and stalls the regrowth of axons, suggesting that microglia are critical for orchestrating the injury response. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and functional analyses, we find that neonatal microglia are transiently activated and have at least two key roles in scar-free healing. First, they transiently secrete fibronectin and its binding proteins to form bridges of extracellular matrix that ligate the severed ends of the spinal cord. Second, neonatal—but not adult—microglia express several extracellular and intracellular peptidase inhibitors, as well as other molecules that are involved in resolving inflammation. We transplanted either neonatal microglia or adult microglia treated with peptidase inhibitors into spinal cord lesions of adult mice, and found that both types of microglia significantly improved healing and axon regrowth. Together, our results reveal the cellular and molecular basis of the nearly complete recovery of neonatal mice after spinal cord injury, and suggest strategies that could be used to facilitate scar-free healing in the adult mammalian nervous system. In neonatal mice, scar-free healing after spinal cord injury is organized by microglia, and transplantation of neonatal microglia or peptidase-inhibitor-treated adult microglia into adult mice after injury improves healing and axon regrowth."
https://openalex.org/W3092537844,"The development of intestinal organoids from single adult intestinal stem cells in vitro recapitulates the regenerative capacity of the intestinal epithelium1,2. Here we unravel the mechanisms that orchestrate both organoid formation and the regeneration of intestinal tissue, using an image-based screen to assay an annotated library of compounds. We generate multivariate feature profiles for hundreds of thousands of organoids to quantitatively describe their phenotypic landscape. We then use these phenotypic fingerprints to infer regulatory genetic interactions, establishing a new approach to the mapping of genetic interactions in an emergent system. This allows us to identify genes that regulate cell-fate transitions and maintain the balance between regeneration and homeostasis, unravelling previously unknown roles for several pathways, among them retinoic acid signalling. We then characterize a crucial role for retinoic acid nuclear receptors in controlling exit from the regenerative state and driving enterocyte differentiation. By combining quantitative imaging with RNA sequencing, we show the role of endogenous retinoic acid metabolism in initiating transcriptional programs that guide the cell-fate transitions of intestinal epithelium, and we identify an inhibitor of the retinoid X receptor that improves intestinal regeneration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3091926688,"Perceptual sensitivity varies from moment to moment. One potential source of this variability is spontaneous fluctuations in cortical activity that can travel as waves1. Spontaneous travelling waves have been reported during anaesthesia2–7, but it is not known whether they have a role during waking perception. Here, using newly developed analytic techniques to characterize the moment-to-moment dynamics of noisy multielectrode data, we identify spontaneous waves of activity in the extrastriate visual cortex of awake, behaving marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). In monkeys trained to detect faint visual targets, the timing and position of spontaneous travelling waves before target onset predicted the magnitude of target-evoked activity and the likelihood of target detection. By contrast, spatially disorganized fluctuations of neural activity were much less predictive. These results reveal an important role for spontaneous travelling waves in sensory processing through the modulation of neural and perceptual sensitivity. Timing and position of spontaneously arising waves of activity in the visual cortex predict the sensitivity of visual perception in awake, behaving marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)."
https://openalex.org/W3092250464,"Cysteine palmitoylation (S-palmitoylation) is a reversible post-translational modification that is installed by the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases and is reversed by several acyl protein thioesterases1,2. Although thousands of human proteins are known to undergo S-palmitoylation, how this modification is regulated to modulate specific biological functions is poorly understood. Here we report that the key T helper 17 (TH17) cell differentiation stimulator, STAT33,4, is subject to reversible S-palmitoylation on cysteine 108. DHHC7 palmitoylates STAT3 and promotes its membrane recruitment and phosphorylation. Acyl protein thioesterase 2 (APT2, also known as LYPLA2) depalmitoylates phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and enables it to translocate to the nucleus. This palmitoylation–depalmitoylation cycle enhances STAT3 activation and promotes TH17 cell differentiation; perturbation of either palmitoylation or depalmitoylation negatively affects TH17 cell differentiation. Overactivation of TH17 cells is associated with several inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a mouse model, pharmacological inhibition of APT2 or knockout of Zdhhc7—which encodes DHHC7—relieves the symptoms of IBD. Our study reveals not only a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBD but also a model through which S-palmitoylation regulates cell signalling, which might be broadly applicable for understanding the signalling functions of numerous S-palmitoylation events. The dynamic and reversible S-palmitoylation of the transcription factor STAT3 enhances its activation and promotes the differentiation of TH17 cells."
https://openalex.org/W3099394237,"Annular structures (rings and gaps) in disks around pre-main-sequence stars have been detected in abundance towards class II protostellar objects that are approximately 1,000,000 years old1. These structures are often interpreted as evidence of planet formation1-3, with planetary-mass bodies carving rings and gaps in the disk4. This implies that planet formation may already be underway in even younger disks in the class I phase, when the protostar is still embedded in a larger-scale dense envelope of gas and dust5. Only within the past decade have detailed properties of disks in the earliest star-forming phases been observed6,7. Here we report 1.3-millimetre dust emission observations with a resolution of five astronomical units that show four annular substructures in the disk of the young (less than 500,000 years old)8 protostar IRS 63. IRS 63 is a single class I source located in the nearby Ophiuchus molecular cloud at a distance of 144 parsecs9, and is one of the brightest class I protostars at millimetre wavelengths. IRS 63 also has a relatively large disk compared to other young disks (greater than 50 astronomical units)10. Multiple annular substructures observed towards disks at young ages can act as an early foothold for dust-grain growth, which is a prerequisite of planet formation. Whether or not planets already exist in the disk of IRS 63, it is clear that the planet-formation process begins in the initial protostellar phases, earlier than predicted by current planet-formation theories11."
https://openalex.org/W3092498064,"Adolescence is a formative phase for social development. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated regulations have led to many changes in adolescents’ lives, including limited opportunities for social interactions. The current exploratory study investigated the effect of the first weeks of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on Dutch adolescents’ (N = 53 with attrition, N = 36 without attrition) mood, empathy, and prosocial behavior. Longitudinal analyses comparing pre-pandemic measures to a three-week peri-pandemic daily diary study showed (i) decreases in empathic concern, opportunities for prosocial actions, and tension, (ii) stable levels of social value orientation, altruism, and dire prosociality, and (iii) increased levels of perspective-taking and vigor during the first weeks of lockdown. Second, this study investigated peri-pandemic effects of familiarity, need, and deservedness on giving behavior. To this end, we utilized novel hypothetical Dictator Games with ecologically valid targets associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents showed higher levels of giving to a friend (a familiar other, about 51% of the total share), a doctor in a hospital (deserving target, 78%), and individuals with COVID-19 or a poor immune system (targets in need, 69 and 63%, respectively) compared to an unfamiliar peer (39%) This suggests that during the pandemic need and deservedness had a greater influence on adolescent giving than familiarity. Overall, this study demonstrates detrimental effects of the first weeks of lockdown on adolescents’ empathic concern and opportunities for prosocial actions, which are important predictors of healthy socio-emotional development. However, adolescents also showed marked resilience and a willingness to benefit others as a result of the lockdown, as evidenced by improved perspective-taking and mood, and high sensitivity to need and deservedness in giving to others."

Our results suggest an involvement of microglia in Dp(16)-mouse cognitive deficits and identify a new potential therapeutic approach for cognitive disabilities in DS individuals. Down syndrome (DS) is the main genetic cause of intellectual disability (Dierssen, 2012Dierssen M. Down syndrome: the brain in trisomic mode.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 844-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and it is caused by a third copy of the human chromosome 21 (HSA21). In addition to cognitive disability mostly in hippocampal-related functions, individuals with DS often suffer from dysfunction of immune responses, such as an increased risk of infections, hematological/autoimmune disorders, and hyperactivation of the interferon (IFN) signaling (Sullivan et al., 2016Sullivan K.D. Lewis H.C. Hill A.A. Pandey A. Jackson L.P. Cabral J.M. Smith K.P. Liggett L.A. Gomez E.B. Galbraith M.D. et al.Trisomy 21 consistently activates the interferon response.eLife. 2016; 5: e16220Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, peripheral or brain inflammation has been extensively linked to decreased cognition in the young and physiologically aging brain. This suggests a possible regulation of inflammatory states in learning and memory (Shobin et al., 2017Shobin E. Bowley M.P. Estrada L.I. Heyworth N.C. Orczykowski M.E. Eldridge S.A. Calderazzo S.M. Mortazavi F. Moore T.L. Rosene D.L. Microglia activation and phagocytosis: relationship with aging and cognitive impairment in the rhesus monkey.Geroscience. 2017; 39: 199-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The resident immunological cells of the CNS are microglia, the brain macrophages (Ginhoux et al., 2013Ginhoux F. Lim S. Hoeffel G. Low D. Huber T. Origin and differentiation of microglia.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In adults under physiological conditions, these cells show a ramified morphology, and they constantly surveil the brain parenchyma (Tremblay et al., 2011Tremblay M.E. Stevens B. Sierra A. Wake H. Bessis A. Nimmerjahn A. The role of microglia in the healthy brain.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 16064-16069Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In the case of injury and in the presence of pro-inflammatory molecules, microglia shift morphology to a mobile, more amoeboid form with increased branching movements (Arcuri et al., 2017Arcuri C. Mecca C. Bianchi R. Giambanco I. Donato R. The pathophysiological role of microglia in dynamic surveillance, phagocytosis and structural remodeling of the developing CNS.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2017; 10: 191Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar; Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007Hanisch U.K. Kettenmann H. Microglia: active sensor and versatile effector cells in the normal and pathologic brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (2463) Google Scholar). During inflammation, microglia also present depolarized membrane potential, upregulation of activation and phagocytosis markers (MHCII, Iba1, and CD68, Lamp1, respectively), and downregulation of Gi-coupled receptor for adenosine diphosphate (ADP) P2Y12 and secrete large amount of cytokines (Sipe et al., 2016Sipe G.O. Lowery R.L. Tremblay M.E. Kelly E.A. Lamantia C.E. Majewska A.K. Microglial P2Y12 is necessary for synaptic plasticity in mouse visual cortex.Nat.

Neurosci. 2013; 7: 44Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Interestingly, microglia also play key roles during early development and in juvenile animals (Tremblay et al., 2011Tremblay M.E. Stevens B. Sierra A. Wake H. Bessis A. Nimmerjahn A. The role of microglia in the healthy brain.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 16064-16069Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In particular, they shape the synaptic landscape of the developing brain through phagocytosis of neural progenitors and dendritic synaptic pruning in experience-dependent brain plasticity (Kaur et al., 2017Kaur C. Rathnasamy G. Ling E.A. Biology of microglia in the developing brain.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2017; 76: 736-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Wu et al., 2015Wu Y. Dissing-Olesen L. MacVicar B.A. Stevens B. Microglia: dynamic mediators of synapse development and plasticity.Trends Immunol. 2015; 36: 605-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Remarkably, dendritic spine deficits have been extensively described in DS persons and murine models (Dierssen, 2012Dierssen M. Down syndrome: the brain in trisomic mode.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 844-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar; Haas et al., 2013Haas M.A. Bell D. Slender A. Lana-Elola E. Watson-Scales S. Fisher E.M. Tybulewicz V.L. Guillemot F. Alterations to dendritic spine morphology, but not dendrite patterning, of cortical projection neurons in Tc1 and Ts1Rhr mouse models of Down syndrome.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e78561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An increased immunological activity with a subsequent increase in microglial activation and excessive spine pruning could therefore play a role in the cognitive deficits in DS. To test this hypothesis, we used the Dp(16) mouse model of DS. Dp(16) mice bear a duplication orthologous to the region q11–q22.3 of HSA21 on one chromosome 16, and they recapitulate many of the characteristics of the human syndrome, including cognitive deficits (Goodliffe et al., 2016Goodliffe J.W. Olmos-Serrano J.L. Aziz N.M. Pennings J.L. Guedj F. Bianchi D.W. Haydar T.F. Absence of prenatal forebrain defects in the Dp(16)1Yey/+ mouse model of Down syndrome.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 2926-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar; Li et al., 2007Li Z. Yu T. Morishima M. Pao A. LaDuca J. Conroy J. Nowak N. Matsui S. Shiraishi I. Yu Y.E. Duplication of the entire 22.9 Mb human chromosome 21 syntenic region on mouse chromosome 16 causes cardiovascular and gastrointestinal abnormalities.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Here, we show that hippocampal Dp(16) microglia display an activated state characterized by morphofunctional alterations; increased levels of Iba1, CD68, and Lamp1; decreased levels of P2Y12; and increased IFN signaling. Microglial alterations are accompanied by a reduction of neuronal dendritic spines and activity together with downregulation of drebrin (DBN), a protein essential for correct spine functioning and dysregulated in DS. The depletion of microglia or the treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug acetaminophen rescues microglia alterations, the neuronal spine-associated phenotypes, and cognitive deficits in juvenile Dp(16) mice. Finally, post mortem brains of DS subjects show dysregulation of immunological pathways with enrichment of dysregulated genes in microglial cells and an activated microglial phenotype similar to that of Dp(16) mice. To start our investigation on the role of microglia in DS, we counted the number and analyzed the morphology of microglia (defined as Iba1+ cells; Ginhoux et al., 2013Ginhoux F. Lim S. Hoeffel G. Low D. Huber T. Origin and differentiation of microglia.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) in hippocampal brain slices (stratum pyramidalis of the CA (cornus ammonis)1, CA3, and DG (dentate gyrus) regions) from postnatal day (P)22 animals of the Dp(16) mouse model of DS and wild-type (WT) littermates (Figures 1A and 1B ). We found no difference in the number of microglia between the two strains (WT: 341.14 ± 15.28 Iba1+ cells/mm2, n = 7; Dp(16): 338.3 ± 9.26 Iba1+ cells/mm2, n = 4). However, when compared to WT microglia, Dp(16) microglia presented enlarged cell bodies (Figures 1B and 1C), branching impairment (Figures 1D–1F). A specific skeleton analysis on the same cells revealed a significant decrease in branch numbers (Figures 1G and 1H), with no changes in average branch length (WT 3.53 ± 0.35 μm, n = 8; Dp(16): 3.45 ± 0.13 μm, n = 7). We observed no significant gender difference within genotypes. Microglia distribution and transcriptional identity is regionally heterogeneous in the brain (Masuda et al., 2019Masuda T. Sankowski R. Staszewski O. Böttcher C. Amann L. Sagar Scheiwe C. Nessler S. Kunz P. van Loo G. et al.Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of mouse and human microglia at single-cell resolution.Nature. 2019; 566: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the somatosensory cortex, we found a cell-body enlargement in trisomic microglia similar to that observed in the hippocampus (Figures S1B and S1C) but no differences in branch number and distribution between the two strains (Figures S1D–S1H). However, we observed a significant increase in the average length of the branches developed by trisomic microglia (Figure S1I). Next, we investigated whether the morphological rearrangement of the Dp(16) hippocampal microglia corresponded to a baseline activation state. Thus, we crossed Dp(16) animals with CX3CR1-GFP animals. This resulted in GFP+ microglia in brains from WTCX3CR1-GFP and Dp(16)CX3CR1-GFP mice. We then performed patch-clamp experiments on GFP+ cells in the hippocampus of acute brain slices at P22. Trisomic microglia presented an input current/voltage (I/V) profile with larger outward currents typical of activated microglia (Figure 1I; Carrillo-de Sauvage et al., 2013Carrillo-de Sauvage M.A. Maatouk L. Arnoux I. Pasco M. Sanz Diez A. Delahaye M. Herrero M.T. Newman T.A. Calvo C.F. Audinat E. et al.Potent and multiple regulatory actions of microglial glucocorticoid receptors during CNS inflammation.Cell Death Differ. 2013; 20: 1546-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, Dp(16) microglia presented increased branch mobility and branch movement speed (Figures 1J–1L) by ex vivo live imaging. When we analyzed microglial activity and phagocytosis markers via immunohistochemistry and western blotting, we found increased Iba1, CD68, and Lamp1 levels; no difference in MHCII expression; and decreased P2Y12 levels in Dp(16) microglia (Figure S2). We then measured 40 cytokines using an antibody array in hippocampal lysates from Dp(16) and WT littermates and found a significant increase in the levels of 15 cytokines typical of activated microglia (Figures S3A and S3B). Finally, we defined the activated state of DS microglia by profiling their protein-expression pattern. We ran proteomic analysis on microglia homogenates obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of hippocampal cellular suspensions from WTCX3CR1-GFP and Dp(16)CX3CR1-GFP mice. We found 44 differentially expressed proteins (Table S1). When we ran a gene ontology for biological processes (GOBP) analysis on the differentially expressed proteins, the cellular response to IFN-alpha (IFNα) resulted significantly dysregulated from our analysis restricted to microglia (Figure S4A). This suggests that the hyperactive IFN signaling may contribute to the hyperactivation of microglia in Dp(16) animals (Papageorgiou et al., 2016Papageorgiou I.E. Lewen A. Galow L.V. Cesetti T. Scheffel J. Regen T. Hanisch U.K. Kann O. TLR4-activated microglia require IFN-γ to induce severe neuronal dysfunction and death in situ.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 212-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, the remaining 6 out of 7 biological processes significantly dysregulated in DS microglia were involved in overall DNA and RNA processing (Figure S4A). These data point to a state of activation of microglia in Dp(16) mice. Next, we tested whether the activated microglia could play a role in cognitive deficits of Dp(16) mice. Because stress per se may cause microglial activation (Delpech et al., 2016Delpech J.C. Wei L. Hao J. Yu X. Madore C. Butovsky O. Kaffman A. Early life stress perturbs the maturation of microglia in the developing hippocampus.Brain Behav. Immun. 2016; 57: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we subjected DS animals and their WT littermates to two mildly stressful hippocampus-dependent cognitive tests: the novel object recognition (NOR) and object location test (OLT). DS animals presented cognitive deficits in NOR and OLT compared to their WT littermates (Figures 2A, 2E, and 2F ). Interestingly, when we ran a proteomic analysis on the hippocampi of P22 Dp(16) animals and WT littermates followed by GOBP analysis on the 169 differentially expressed proteins (Table S1), we found the term “memory” among the first hits (Figures S5A and S5B; Table S2). To directly address whether defective microglia play a role in the low performance of Dp(16) mice in NOR and OLT, we took advantage of PLX3397. PLX3397 is a drug that decreases the microglial population, without causing significant cognitive impairment in WT animals (Elmore et al., 2014Elmore M.R. Najafi A.R. Koike M.A. Dagher N.N. Spangenberg E.E. Rice R.A. Kitazawa M. Matusow B. Nguyen H. West B.L. Green K.N. Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor signaling is necessary for microglia viability, unmasking a microglia progenitor cell in the adult brain.Neuron. 2014; 82: 380-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). We thus treated P16 Dp(16) mice and their WT littermates with PLX3397 in their food supply (445 mg/kg of food available ad libitum) for 1 week and then evaluated the impact of microglial depletion on cognitive performance at P22 (Figure 2A). As expected, PLX3397 treatment sharply decreased the microglia count and Iba1 protein levels in the hippocampus of WT and Dp(16) mice (Figures 2B–2D). PLX3397 caused a trend to decreased levels of oligodendrocyte progenitors (NG2) in Dp(16) mice (Figure 2D), as previously shown (Liu et al., 2019Liu Y. Given K.S. Dickson E.L. Owens G.P. Macklin W.B. Bennett J.L. Concentration-dependent effects of CSF1R inhibitors on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells ex vivo and in vivo.Exp. Neurol. 2019; 318: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, this reduction, in our hands, was not statistically significant. Remarkably, PLX3397 treatment in Dp(16) mice fully rescued their cognitive deficits in the NOR and OLT tests (Figures 2E and 2F). These data indicate that depletion of activated microglia ameliorates cognitive performance in DS mice. We then investigated whether the overactive microglia of the Dp(16) mice could impair their cognitive performance by affecting the number and/or the level of maturation of neuronal spines. We first focused on the dendritic spine marker DBN. We observed significantly decreased levels of DBN in the hippocampi of P22 Dp(16) mice in comparison to WT mice (Figure 3A). Accordingly, when we ran a targeted proteomic protocol on hippocampi from Dp(16) and WT littermates, we found a sharp decrease in the levels of 4 different peptide fragments ascribed to DBN in trisomic mice (Figures S5C and S5D). Interestingly, PLX3397 treatment completely rescued the DBN levels in Dp(16) mice (Figure 3A). In agreement with our hypothesis, we found a decreased number of spines in CA1 hippocampal excitatory pyramidal neurons from Dp(16) mice counted after Golgi-Cox staining, which was rescued by the PLX3397 treatment (Figures 3B and 3C). In particular, PLX3397 rescued the density of motile functional spines (thin, stubby, and mushroom type) without affecting the immature filamentous (Figures S6A–S6C). To investigate whether defective trisomic microglia also impinge on the correct functionality of neuronal dendritic spines, we recorded miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) in WT and Dp(16) neurons from acute brain slices of animals treated with PLX3397. PLX3397 treatment fully rescued the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs, which we found affected in Dp(16) in comparison to WT mice (Figures 3D and 3E). Finally, we performed electron microscopy and immunostaining to further support our hypothesis for the role of the overactive microglia in DS animals in regulating the number of neuronal spines. In P22 Dp(16) mice, we observed an increased number of contacts between microglia and pre-/post-synaptic elements compared to WT animals (Figures 3F and 3G) and an increase of excitatory synaptic marker (Vglut1 and Psd-95) puncta engulfed by microglia (Figures 3H–3J). These data are consistent with a causal role of overactive microglia for altered neuronal dendritic-spine turnover and function in Dp(16) mice. Recent evidence in brains from the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS and from subjects with DS indicates increased expression of the inducible form of the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes (Cox2) in microglia and neurons (Mulet et al., 2017Mulet M. Blasco-Ibáńez J.M. Crespo C. Nácher J. Varea E. Early increased density of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) immunoreactive neurons in Down syndrome.Folia Neuropathol. 2017; 55: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This is a sign of increased immunological activity, because activated microglia produce a large amount of the pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Zhang et al., 2009Zhang D. Hu X. Qian L. Wilson B. Lee C. Flood P. Langenbach R. Hong J.S. Prostaglandin E2 released from activated microglia enhances astrocyte proliferation in vitro.Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2009; 238: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In Dp(16) hippocampal microglia, we also found increased Cox2 and PGE2 expression (Figures S7A–S7D). Therefore, we considered acetaminophen (APAP), a main Cox2 inhibitor that reduces PGE2 production, as a potential candidate to rescue the microglia and cognitive impairments in Dp(16) mice. APAP readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, has a very safe profile with a few contraindications, and might downregulate the expression of IFN-induced genes (Farnsworth et al., 2010Farnsworth A.

Thus, we injected Dp(16) mice and WT littermates with 1 dose of APAP (intraperitoneally [i.p.], 100 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (i.p., DMSO, 2%; Figure 4A) during 3 consecutive days. APAP treatment significantly rescued the levels of Cox2 and PGE2 in Dp(16) microglia (Figures S7A–S7D). Moreover, APAP treatment rescued microglial morphology (Figures 4B, 4C, and S7E–S7I) and the levels of Iba1 (Figure S2B) in the hippocampi of Dp(16) mice and the microglia cell body area in the somatosensory cortex (Figures S1B and S1C). Finally, treatment with APAP in vivo was also able to rescue the ex vivo electrophysiological signature of activated microglia (Figure 4D). Notably, acute bath application of APAP (1 h, 300 μM) to brain slices from naive WTCX3CR1-GFP and Dp(16)CX3CR1-GFP animals was sufficient to rescue the electrophysiological signature of activated DS microglia together with the hyper-motility and the speed movement of DS microglial branches (Figures 5A–5D).Figure 5Acute APAP Treatment Influences Microglia Activity, and TrpV1 Channels Acutely Regulate Microglia Activation in Dp(16) AnimalsShow full caption(A) Experimental protocol.(B) Voltage-activated current profile in microglia of WTCX3CR1-GFP and Dp(16)CX3CR1-GFP hippocampal slices (left inset) treated acutely with vehicle or APAP.

In parenthesis: analyzed cells, animals. (H) Cartoon depicting the putative mechanism of action of APAP. FAAH, fatty acid amide hydrolase. Thus, APAP’s action may be mediated not only by the inhibition of COX enzymes—which is slow because it requires a first decrease in PGE2 synthesis and a consequent change in gene expression (Ajmone-Cat et al., 2010Ajmone-Cat M.A. Bernardo A. Greco A. Minghetti L. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and brain inflammation: effects on microglial functions.Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2010; 3: 1949-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)—but also by another faster unknown mechanism. Therefore, we characterized the possible mediators of the fast action of APAP on microglia. In particular, literature suggests that it is not APAP tout-court but its metabolite AM404 that is able to inhibit microglial activation (Sharma et al., 2017Sharma C.V. Long J.H. Shah S. Rahman J. Perrett D. Ayoub S.S. Mehta V. First evidence of the conversion of paracetamol to AM404 in human cerebrospinal fluid.J. Pain Res. 2017; 10: 2703-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Among the targets of AM404 on microglia (other than COX enzymes) is the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TrpV1). This receptor channel is highly expressed in microglia, where it inhibits microglia activation and production of PGE (Bhatia et al., 2017Bhatia H.S. Roelofs N. Muñoz E. Fiebich B.L. Alleviation of microglial activation induced by p38 MAPK/MK2/PGE2 axis by capsaicin: potential involvement of other than TRPV1 mechanism/s.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 116Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To mimic the effect of APAP, we bath applied the most potent and selective endogenous agonist of TrpV1, N-oleoyldopamine (OLDA), in ex vivo slices from WTCX3CR1-GFP and Dp(16)CX3CR1-GFP animals during electrophysiological recordings (Figure 5E). In agreement with our hypothesis, OLDA fully rescued microglial activation (Figure 5E). Although OLDA has a very high affinity to TrpV1, it can also bind to the cannabinoid receptors CB1/CB2 (Zhong and Wang, 2008Zhong B. Wang D.H. N-oleoyldopamine, a novel endogenous capsaicin-like lipid, protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury via activation of TRPV1.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2008; 295: H728-H735Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hence, to tease apart the role of these two pathways on microglia activation, we performed the same electrophysiology experiment with bath application of OLDA together with AM-251 (inhibitor of CB1) and AM-630 (inhibitor of CB2). Bath application of the three drugs rescued the membrane potential of Dp(16) microglia (Figure 5F), indicating that receptors CB1/CB2 may be dispensable for microglia activation. Finally, we bath applied APAP together with a potent blocker of Trpv1, capsazepine. This was able to fully prevent the rescuing action of APAP on microglia (Figures 5G and 5H). These data suggest that APAP’s action on Dp(16) microglia is mediated not only by its action on COX enzymes but also by a faster activation of Trpv1 channels. To further probe the impact of APAP treatment on DS microglia in vivo, we performed a proteomic analysis on FACS-sorted microglial cells from WTCX3CR1-GFP and Dp(16)CX3CR1-GFP animals treated for 3 days (P20–P22) with either APAP or vehicle (Figure 6A). On these samples, we ran a principal-component analysis (PCA) on the proteomic data. The PCA evidenced an extensive resemblance between Dp(16) microglia after the treatment with APAP and WT microglia after vehicle treatment. Conversely, microglia from Dp(16) mice treated with vehicle fell far apart (Figure 6B). Next, we ran a weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to define biologically meaningful groups of proteins (clusters) based on their co-expression patterns (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008Langfelder P. Horvath S. WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 559Crossref PubMed Scopus (6"
https://openalex.org/W3091996054,"Every cell in the human body has a unique set of somatic mutations, but it remains difficult to comprehensively genotype an individual cell1. Here we describe ways to overcome this obstacle in the context of normal human skin, thus offering a glimpse into the genomic landscapes of individual melanocytes from human skin. As expected, sun-shielded melanocytes had fewer mutations than sun-exposed melanocytes. However, melanocytes from chronically sun-exposed skin (for example, the face) had a lower mutation burden than melanocytes from intermittently sun-exposed skin (for example, the back). Melanocytes located adjacent to a skin cancer had higher mutation burdens than melanocytes from donors without skin cancer, implying that the mutation burden of normal skin can be used to measure cumulative sun damage and risk of skin cancer. Moreover, melanocytes from healthy skin commonly contained pathogenic mutations, although these mutations tended to be weakly oncogenic, probably explaining why they did not give rise to discernible lesions. Phylogenetic analyses identified groups of related melanocytes, suggesting that melanocytes spread throughout skin as fields of clonally related cells that are invisible to the naked eye. Overall, our results uncover the genomic landscapes of individual melanocytes, providing key insights into the causes and origins of melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W3091918160,"An important tenet of learning and memory is the notion of a molecular switch that promotes the formation of long-term memory1-4. The regulation of proteostasis is a critical and rate-limiting step in the consolidation of new memories5-10. One of the most effective and prevalent ways to enhance memory is by regulating the synthesis of proteins controlled by the translation initiation factor eIF211. Phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF2 (p-eIF2α), the central component of the integrated stress response (ISR), impairs long-term memory formation in rodents and birds11-13. By contrast, inhibiting the ISR by mutating the eIF2α phosphorylation site, genetically11 and pharmacologically inhibiting the ISR kinases14-17, or mimicking reduced p-eIF2α with the ISR inhibitor ISRIB11, enhances long-term memory in health and disease18. Here we used molecular genetics to dissect the neuronal circuits by which the ISR gates cognitive processing. We found that learning reduces eIF2α phosphorylation in hippocampal excitatory neurons and a subset of hippocampal inhibitory neurons (those that express somatostatin, but not parvalbumin). Moreover, ablation of p-eIF2α in either excitatory or somatostatin-expressing (but not parvalbumin-expressing) inhibitory neurons increased general mRNA translation, bolstered synaptic plasticity and enhanced long-term memory. Thus, eIF2α-dependent mRNA translation controls memory consolidation via autonomous mechanisms in excitatory and somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W3091780730,"Infant cries evoke powerful responses in parents1–4. Whether parental animals are intrinsically sensitive to neonatal vocalizations, or instead learn about vocal cues for parenting responses is unclear. In mice, pup-naive virgin females do not recognize the meaning of pup distress calls, but retrieve isolated pups to the nest after having been co-housed with a mother and litter5–9. Distress calls are variable, and require co-caring virgin mice to generalize across calls for reliable retrieval10,11. Here we show that the onset of maternal behaviour in mice results from interactions between intrinsic mechanisms and experience-dependent plasticity in the auditory cortex. In maternal females, calls with inter-syllable intervals (ISIs) from 75 to 375 milliseconds elicited pup retrieval, and cortical responses were generalized across these ISIs. By contrast, naive virgins were neuronally and behaviourally sensitized to the most common (‘prototypical’) ISIs. Inhibitory and excitatory neural responses were initially mismatched in the cortex of naive mice, with untuned inhibition and overly narrow excitation. During co-housing experiments, excitatory responses broadened to represent a wider range of ISIs, whereas inhibitory tuning sharpened to form a perceptual boundary. We presented synthetic calls during co-housing and observed that neurobehavioural responses adjusted to match these statistics, a process that required cortical activity and the hypothalamic oxytocin system. Neuroplastic mechanisms therefore build on an intrinsic sensitivity in the mouse auditory cortex, and enable rapid plasticity for reliable parenting behaviour. The onset of maternal behaviour in mice involves an interaction between intrinsic tuning of auditory cortical neurons and experience-dependent plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3092500016,"Excessive reliance on chemical fertilizer (CF) in conventional farming is a serious concern owing to its negative effects on soil health, the environment, and crop productivity. Organic manure is an alternative source of fertilizer to reduce the amount of CF usage in agriculture, decrease environmental pollution, and ensure sustainable crop production. This study assessed the integrated effect of poultry manure (PM) and cattle manure (CM) with CF on soil properties, plant physiology, and rice grain yield. Additionally, the difference in pre-and post-anthesis dry matter (DM) and nitrogen (N) accumulation and their relationship with grain yield was also determined. Pot experiments were performed in the early and late growing season at the experimental station of Guangxi University, China, in 2018. A total of six treatments, i.e., T1—CF0; T2−100% CF; T3−60% CM + 40% CF; T4−30% CM + 70% CF; T5−60% PM + 40% CF, and T6−30% PM + 70% CF were used in this pot experiment. Results showed that T6 enhanced leaf photosynthetic efficiency by 11% and 16%, chlorophyll content by 8% and 11%, panicle number by 12% and 16%, and grain yield by 11% and 15% in the early and late seasons, respectively, compared to T2. Similarly1, post-anthesis N and DM accumulation, N uptake, and soil properties (i.e., soil organic carbon, total N, and bulk density) were improved with integrated CF and manure treatments over the sole CF treatments. Interestingly, increases in post-anthesis N uptake and DM production were further supported by enhanced N-metabolizing enzyme activities (i.e., nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate oxoglutarate aminotransferase during the grain-filling period in combined treatments. In-addition, the linear regression analysis showed that post-anthesis DM (R2 = 0.95) and N (R2 = 0.96) accumulation were highly associated with grain yield of rice. Thus, the combination of 30% N from PM or CM with 70% N from CF (i.e., urea) is a promising option for improvement of soil quality and rice grain yield. Furthermore, our study provides a sustainable nutrient management plan to increase rice yield with high N use efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3092511958,"Since 1814, when rubella was first described, the origins of the disease and its causative agent, rubella virus (Matonaviridae: Rubivirus), have remained unclear1. Here we describe ruhugu virus and rustrela virus in Africa and Europe, respectively, which are, to our knowledge, the first known relatives of rubella virus. Ruhugu virus, which is the closest relative of rubella virus, was found in apparently healthy cyclops leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros cyclops) in Uganda. Rustrela virus, which is an outgroup to the clade that comprises rubella and ruhugu viruses, was found in acutely encephalitic placental and marsupial animals at a zoo in Germany and in wild yellow-necked field mice (Apodemus flavicollis) at and near the zoo. Ruhugu and rustrela viruses share an identical genomic architecture with rubella virus2,3. The amino acid sequences of four putative B cell epitopes in the fusion (E1) protein of the rubella, ruhugu and rustrela viruses and two putative T cell epitopes in the capsid protein of the rubella and ruhugu viruses are moderately to highly conserved4-6. Modelling of E1 homotrimers in the post-fusion state predicts that ruhugu and rubella viruses have a similar capacity for fusion with the host-cell membrane5. Together, these findings show that some members of the family Matonaviridae can cross substantial barriers between host species and that rubella virus probably has a zoonotic origin. Our findings raise concerns about future zoonotic transmission of rubella-like viruses, but will facilitate comparative studies and animal models of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome."

Survival also depends on suppressing the threat-response during a stimulus that predicts the absence of threat (safety)2-5. An understanding of the biological substrates of emotional memories during a task in which animals learn to flexibly execute defensive responses to a threat-predictive cue and a safety cue is critical for developing treatments for memory disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder5. The centrolateral amygdala is an important node in the neuronal circuit that mediates defensive responses6-9, and a key brain area for processing and storing threat memories. Here we applied intersectional chemogenetic strategies to inhibitory neurons in the centrolateral amygdala of mice to block cell-type-specific translation programs that are sensitive to depletion of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (p-eIF2α). We show that de novo translation in somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons in the centrolateral amygdala is necessary for the long-term storage of conditioned-threat responses, whereas de novo translation in protein kinase Cδ-expressing inhibitory neurons in the centrolateral amygdala is necessary for the inhibition of a conditioned response to a safety cue. Our results provide insight into the role of de novo protein synthesis in distinct inhibitory neuron populations in the centrolateral amygdala during the consolidation of long-term memories."
https://openalex.org/W3092214436,"Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is a Tobamovirus that was first observed in 2014 and 2015 on tomato plants in Israel and Jordan respectively. Since the first description, the virus has been reported from all continents except Oceania and Antarctica, and has been found infecting both tomato and pepper crops. In October 2019, the Dutch National Plant Protection Organization received a ToBRFV infected tomato sample as part of a generic survey targeting tomato pests. Presence of the virus was verified using Illumina sequencing. A follow-up survey was initiated to determine the extent of ToBRFV presence in the Dutch tomato horticulture and identify possible linkages between ToBRFV genotypes, companies and epidemiological traits. Nextstrain was used to visualize these potential connections. By November 2019, 68 companies had been visited of which 17 companies were found to be infected. The 50 ToBRFV genomes from these outbreak locations group in three main clusters, which are hypothesized to represent three original sources. No correlation was found between genotypes, companies and epidemiological traits, and the source(s) of the Dutch ToBRFV outbreak remain unknown. This paper describes a Nextstrain build containing ToBRFV genomes up to and including November 2019. Sharing data with this interactive online tool will enable the plant virology field to better understand and communicate the diversity and spread of this new virus. Organizations are invited to share data or materials for inclusion in the Nextstrain build, which can be accessed at https://nextstrain.nrcnvwa.nl/ToBRFV/20191231."

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate whether multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion results in better patient survival. Materials and methods MDT discussion was optional before February 2016 and was actively encouraged by the MDT committee beginning February 2016. We reviewed the medical charts and computer records of patients with stage III NSCLC between January 2013 and December 2018. Results A total of 515 patients were included. The median survival of all the patients was 33.9 months (M). The median survival of patients who were treated after MDT discussion was 41.2 M and that of patients treated without MDT discussion was 25.7 M (p = 0.018). The median survival of patients treated before February 2016 was 25.7 M and that of patients treated after February 2016 was 33.9 M (p = 0.003). The median survival of patients with stage IIIA tumors and those with stage IIIB tumors was 39.4 M and 25.7 M, respectively (p = 0.141). Multivariate analysis showed that MDT or not (p<0.001), T staging (p = 0.009), performance status (p<0.001), and surgery (p = 0.016) to be significant prognostic factors. Conclusion The results of the study show that MDT discussion results in survival benefit in patients with stage III NSCLC. The MDT discussion, performance status, and if surgery was performed were independent prognostic factors for patients with stage III NSCLC."

Epidemiologic observations could critically aid the development of protective measures to combat this devastating viral outbreak. Recent observations, linked nation based universal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination to potential protection against morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2, and received much attention in public media. We wished to validate the findings by examining the country based association between COVID-19 mortality per million population, or daily rates of COVID-19 case fatality (i.e. Death Per Case/Days of the endemic [dpc/d]) and the presence of universal BCG vaccination before 1980, or the year of the establishment of universal BCG vaccination. These associations were examined in multiple regression modeling based on publicly available databases on both April 3rd and May 15th of 2020. COVID-19 deaths per million negatively associated with universal BCG vaccination in a country before 1980 based on May 15th data, but this was not true for COVID-19 dpc/d on either of days of inquiry. We also demonstrate possible arbitrary selection bias in such analyses. Consequently, caution should be exercised amidst the publication surge on COVID-19, due to political/economical-, arbitrary selection-, and fear/anxiety related biases, which may obscure scientific rigor. We argue that global COVID-19 epidemiologic data is unreliable and therefore should be critically scrutinized before using it as a nidus for subsequent hypothesis driven scientific discovery."
https://openalex.org/W3092452555,"The human visual pathway is specialized for the perception of fine spatial detail. The neural circuitry that determines visual acuity begins in the retinal fovea, where the resolution afforded by a dense array of cone photoreceptors is preserved in the retinal output by a remarkable non-divergent circuit: cone → midget bipolar interneuron → midget ganglion cell (the ""private line""). How the private line develops is unknown; it could involve early specification of extremely precise synaptic connections or, by contrast, emerge slowly in concordance with the gradual maturation of foveal architecture and visual sensitivity. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we reconstructed the midget circuitry in the fetal human fovea by serial electron microscopy. We discovered that the midget private line is sculpted by synaptic remodeling beginning early in fetal life, with midget bipolar cells contacting a single cone by mid-gestation and bipolar cell-ganglion cell connectivity undergoing a more protracted period of refinement."
https://openalex.org/W3028751448,"The relationship between a screening tests' positive predictive value, $\rho$, and its target prevalence, $\phi$, is proportional - though not linear in all but a special case. In consequence, there is a point of local extrema of curvature defined only as a function of the sensitivity $a$ and specificity $b$ beyond which the rate of change of a test's $\rho$ drops precipitously relative to $\phi$. Herein, we show the mathematical model exploring this phenomenon and define the $prevalence$ $threshold$ ($\phi_e$) point where this change occurs as: $\phi_e=\frac{\sqrt{a\left(-b+1\right)}+b-1}{(\varepsilon-1)}$ where $\varepsilon$ = $a$+$b$. Using its radical conjugate, we obtain a simplified version of the equation: $\frac{\sqrt{1-b}}{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{1-b}}$. From the prevalence threshold we deduce a more generalized relationship between prevalence and positive predictive value as a function of $\varepsilon$, which represents a fundamental theorem of screening, herein defined as: $\displaystyle\lim_{\varepsilon \to 2}{\displaystyle \int_{0}^{1}}{\rho(\phi)d\phi} = 1$ Understanding the concepts described in this work can help contextualize the validity of screening tests in real time, and help guide the interpretation of different clinical scenarios in which screening is undertaken."
https://openalex.org/W3092045182,"Pollen is an important component of bioaerosol and the distribution of pollen and its relationship with meteorological parameters can be analyzed to better prevent hay fever. Pollen assemblages can also provide basic data for analyzing the relationship between bioaerosol and PM. We collected 82 samples of airborne pollen using a TSP large flow pollen collector from June 1, 2015 to June 1, 2016, from central Zhanjiang city in South China. We also conducted a survey of the nearby vegetation at the same time, in order to characterize the major plant types and their flowering times. We then used data on daily temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, vapor pressure and wind speed from a meteorological station in the center of Zhanjiang City to assess the relationship between the distribution of airborne pollen and meteorological parameters. Our main findings and conclusions are as follows: (1) We identified 15 major pollen types, including Pinus, Castanopsis, Myrica, Euphorbiaceae, Compositae, Gramineae, Microlepia and Polypodiaceae. From the vegetation survey, we found that the pollen from these taxa represented more than 75% of local pollen, while the pollen of Podocarpus, Dacrydium and other regional pollen types represented less than 25%. (2) The pollen concentrations varied significantly in different seasons. The pollen concentrations were at a maximum in spring, consisting mainly of tree pollen; the pollen concentrations were at an intermediate level in autumn and winter, consisting mainly of herb pollen and fern spores; and the pollen concentrations in summer were the lowest, consisting mainly of fern spores. (3) Analysis of the relationship between airborne pollen concentrations and meteorological parameters showed that variations in the pollen concentrations were mainly affected by temperature and relative humidity. In addition, there were substantial differences in these relationships in different seasons. In spring, pollen concentrations were mainly affected by temperature; in summer, they were mainly affected by the direction of the maximum wind speed; in autumn, they were mainly affected by relative humidity and temperature; and in winter, they were mainly affected by relative humidity and wind speed. Temperature and relative humidity promote plant growth and flowering. Notably, the variable wind direction in summer and the increased wind speed in winter and spring are conductive to pollen transmission. (4) Of the 15 major pollen types, Moraceae, Artemisia and Gramineae are the main allergenic pollen types, with peaks in concentration during April-May, August-September, and October-December, respectively. (5) Atypical weather conditions have substantial effects on pollen dispersal. In South China, the pollen concentrations in the sunny day were usually significantly higher than that of the rainy day. The pollen concentrations increased in short rainy days, which usually came from the Herb and Fern pollen. The pollen concentrations decreased in continuous rainy days especially for the Tree and Shrub pollen. the pollen concentrations in the sunny days were usually significantly higher than that in the rainy days. The pollen concentrations increased in short and strong rainfall."
https://openalex.org/W3092329375,"Background The prevalence of psychological complaints is known to be very high in populations of asylum seekers. Despite this, data on the health care system’s ability to adequately meet these high-risk populations’ mental health needs are scarce. This article investigates how well the German outpatient health care system is able to detect and adequately treat them. Methods To this end, we combined data from a cross-sectional survey with billing data from the local social welfare office from the year 2015. Using descriptive statistics, the data of the cross-sectional study are used to quantify the psychological health care needs of asylum seekers while the secondary data analysis indicates the actual access to and extent of psychological treatment. Results In the cross-sectional study, 54% of patients were screened positive for symptoms of depression, 41% for symptoms of anxiety disorder and 18% for symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. In total, 59% were screened positive for at least one of these three disorders. However, when contrasting these screening-based prevalences with the prevalences based on data from the health care system, a mismatch becomes apparent: According to the social welfare office’s billing data, only 2.6% of asylum seekers received the diagnosis of depression, 1.4% were diagnosed with anxiety disorder and 2.9% with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In combination, 4.9% were diagnosed with at least one of these three disorders. Overall, less than one tenth of asylum seekers with symptoms of depression, anxiety or PTSD received the corresponding diagnosis by the health care system. Among those who were diagnosed, about 45% received no treatment at all, while 38% were treated with drugs alone. Only 1% of all patients received psychotherapy. Conclusions Psychological complaints are very common among asylum seekers, yet only a small proportion of this population receives the corresponding diagnoses and treatment. While various factors can contribute to these shortcomings, there is an urgent need to systematically address this deficit and introduce measures to improve mental health care for this high-risk population."

Based on national and provincial apple production data from 1978 to 2016, this study used the apple production concentration index to analyse the evolution characteristics of regional apple production patterns in China. A theoretical analysis framework was established and a spatial econometric model was used to quantitatively explore the influencing factors of China’s apple production layout. The results showed that, first, since the reform and opening-up policy, a general trend of fluctuating growth was found for apple production in China. The centre of apple production layout moved in the southwest direction, with the shift from the Bohai Bay region to the Loess Plateau region. Second, apple production had a significant spatial correlation, while the degree of spatial agglomeration gradually decreased. Third, these changes were significantly influenced by apple comparative income, infrastructure, policies, and climatic conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to continue optimizing and adjusting the apple spatial layout to enhance the technological progress and economic effect of the apple industry and to ensure the stability and balance of regional supply and demand."
https://openalex.org/W3088385009,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations affecting the CFTR gene, is characterised by viscid secretions in multiple organ systems. CF airways contain thick mucus, creating a gradient of hypoxia, which promotes the establishment of polymicrobial infection. Such inflammation predisposes to further infection, a self-perpetuating cycle in mediated by NF-κB. Anaerobic Gram-negative Prevotella spp. are found in sputum from healthy volunteers and CF patients and in CF lungs correlate with reduced levels of inflammation. Prevotella histicola (P. histicola) can suppress murine lung inflammation, however, no studies have examined the role of P. histicola in modulating infection and inflammation in the CF airways. We investigated innate immune signalling and NF-kB activation in CF epithelial cells CFBE41o- in response to clinical stains of P. histicola and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) expressing HEK-293 cells and siRNA assays for TLRs and IKKα were used to confirm signalling pathways. We show that P. histicola infection activated the alternative NF-kB signalling pathway in CF bronchial epithelial cells inducing HIF-1α protein. TLR5 signalling was responsible for the induction of the alternative NF-kB pathway through phosphorylation of IKKα. The induction of transcription factor HIF-1α was inversely associated with the induction of the alternative NF-kB pathway and knockdown of IKKα partially restored canonical NF-kB activation in response to P. histicola. This study demonstrates that different bacterial species in the respiratory microbiome can contribute differently to inflammation, either by activating inflammatory cascades (P. aeruginosa) or by muting the inflammatory response by modulating similar or related pathways (P. histicola). Further work is required to assess the complex interactions of the lung microbiome in response to mixed bacterial infections and their effects in people with CF."
https://openalex.org/W3092175490,"Lignin, a characteristic component of terrestrial plants. Rivers transport large amounts of vascular plant organic matter into the oceans where lignin can degrade over time; however, microorganisms involved in this degradation have not been identified. In this study, several bacterial strains were isolated from marine samples using the lignin-derived compound vanillic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic acid) as the sole carbon and energy source. The optimum growth temperature for all isolates ranged from 30 to 35°C. All isolates grew well in a wide NaCl concentration range of 0 to over 50 g/L, with an optimum concentration of 22.8 g/L, which is the same as natural seawater. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these strains are the members of Halomonas, Arthrobacter, Pseudoalteromonas, Marinomonas, and Thalassospira. These isolates are also able to use other lignin-derived compounds, such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, syringic acid, and benzoic acid. Vanillic acid was detected in all culture media when isolates were grown on ferulic acid as the sole carbon source; however, no 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene was detected, indicating that ferulic acid metabolism by these strains occurs via the elimination of two side chain carbons. Furthermore, the isolates exhibit 3,4-dioxygenase or 4,5-dioxygenase activity for protocatechuic acid ring-cleavage, which is consistent with the genetic sequences of related genera. This study was conducted to isolate and characterize marine bacteria of degrading lignin-derived compounds, thereby revealing the degradation of aromatic compounds in the marine environment and opening up new avenues for the development and utilization of marine biological resources."
https://openalex.org/W3091805710,"In this study, we investigated locomotor activity and responses to repeated light and dark stimuli to assess cannabinoid-induced abnormal behavior in zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio), as an alternative to standard rodent models. To induce the desired responses, we used cannabidiol and WIN55,212-2, two major cannabinoid components. A repeated light and dark test was used to assess how drug exposure influences locomotory responses. Larvae were examined after moderate cannabidiol and WIN55,212-2 exposure and at 24 h after transfer to untreated water. We found that cannabidiol did not produce a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on locomotor activity, with both 0.5 and 10 μg/mL concentrations reducing movement velocity and the total distance moved. However, 10 μg/mL cannabidiol was observed to attenuate the responses of larvae exposed to darkness. No differences were detected between the control and cannabidiol-treated groups after 24 h in fresh water. Fish treated with WIN55,212-2 at 0.5 and 1 μg/mL showed virtually no activity, even in darkness, whereas a concentration of 10 μg/mL induced mortality. A 24-h period in fresh water had the effect of reversing most of the drug-induced immobilization, even in the WIN55,212-2-treated groups. Larvae were also evaluated for their responses to cannabidiol subsequent to an initial exposure to WIN55,212-2, and it was accordingly found that treatment with cannabidiol could attenuate WIN55,212-2-induced abnormal immobilization, whereas equivalent doses of cannabidiol and WIN55,212-2 produced a mixed response. In conclusion, the behavioral effects of the two cannabinoids cannabidiol and WIN55,212-2 appear to be ratio dependent. Furthermore, the repeated light and dark test could serve as a suitable method for assaying drug-induced behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3092275379,"Studies on the paradigm of the preferred movement path are scarce, and as a result, many aspects of the paradigm remain elusive. It remains unknown, for instance, how muscle activity adapts when differences in joint kinematics, due to altered running conditions, are of low / high magnitudes. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to investigate changes in muscle activity of the lower extremities in runners with minimal (≤ 3°) or substantial (> 3°) mean absolute differences in the ankle and knee joint angle trajectories when subjected to different running footwear. Mean absolute differences in the integral of the muscle activity were quantified for the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL), gastrocnemius medialis (GM), soleus (SO), vastus lateralis (VL), and biceps femoris (BF) muscles during over ground running. In runners with minimal changes in 3D joint angle trajectories (≤ 3°), muscle activity was found to change drastically when comparing barefoot to shod running (TA: 35%; PL: 11%; GM: 17%; SO: 10%; VL: 27%; BF: 16%), and minimally when comparing shod to shod running (TA: 10%; PL: 9%; GM: 13%; SO: 8%; VL: 8%; BF: 12%). For runners who showed substantial changes in joint angle trajectories (> 3°), muscle activity changed drastically in barefoot to shod comparisons (TA: 39%; PL: 14%; GM: 16%; SO: 16%; VL: 25%; BF: 24%). It was concluded that a movement path can be maintained with small adaptations in muscle activation when running conditions are similar, while large adaptations in muscle activation are needed when running conditions are substantially different."
https://openalex.org/W3092415416,"We have created the immunodeficient SRG rat, a Sprague-Dawley Rag2/Il2rg double knockout that lacks mature B cells, T cells, and circulating NK cells. This model has been tested and validated for use in oncology (SRG OncoRat®). The SRG rat demonstrates efficient tumor take rates and growth kinetics with different human cancer cell lines and PDXs. Although multiple immunodeficient rodent strains are available, some important human cancer cell lines exhibit poor tumor growth and high variability in those models. The VCaP prostate cancer model is one such cell line that engrafts unreliably and grows irregularly in existing models but displays over 90% engraftment rate in the SRG rat with uniform growth kinetics. Since rats can support much larger tumors than mice, the SRG rat is an attractive host for PDX establishment. Surgically resected NSCLC tissue from nine patients were implanted in SRG rats, seven of which engrafted and grew for an overall success rate of 78%. These developed into a large tumor volume, over 20,000 mm3 in the first passage, which would provide an ample source of tissue for characterization and/or subsequent passage into NSG mice for drug efficacy studies. Molecular characterization and histological analyses were performed for three PDX lines and showed high concordance between passages 1, 2 and 3 (P1, P2, P3), and the original patient sample. Our data suggest the SRG OncoRat is a valuable tool for establishing PDX banks and thus serves as an alternative to current PDX mouse models hindered by low engraftment rates, slow tumor growth kinetics, and multiple passages to develop adequate tissue banks."
https://openalex.org/W3092523711,"Introduction Malaria surveillance is a key pillar in the control of malaria in Africa. The value of using routinely collected data from health facilities to define malaria risk at community levels remains poorly defined. Methods Four cross-sectional parasite prevalence surveys were undertaken among residents at 36 enumeration zones in Kilifi county on the Kenyan coast and temporally and spatially matched to fever surveillance at 6 health facilities serving the same communities over 12 months. The age-structured functional form of the relationship between test positivity rate (TPR) and community-based parasite prevalence (PR) was explored through the development of regression models fitted by alternating the linear, exponential and polynomial terms for PR. The predictive ranges of TPR were explored for PR endemicity risk groups of control programmatic value using cut-offs of low (PR <5%) and high (PR ≥ 30%) transmission intensity. Results Among 28,134 febrile patients encountered for malaria diagnostic testing in the health facilities, 12,143 (43.2%: 95% CI: 42.6%, 43.7%) were positive. The overall community PR was 9.9% (95% CI: 9.2%, 10.7%) among 6,479 participants tested for malaria. The polynomial model was the best fitting model for the data that described the algebraic relationship between TPR and PR. In this setting, a TPR of ≥ 49% in all age groups corresponded to an age-standardized PR of ≥ 30%, while a TPR of < 40% corresponded to an age-standardized PR of < 5%. Conclusion A non-linear relationship was observed between the relative change in TPR and changes in the PR, which is likely to have important implications for malaria surveillance programs, especially at the extremes of transmission. However, larger, more spatially diverse data series using routinely collected TPR data matched to community-based infection prevalence data are required to explore the more practical implications of using TPR as a replacement for community PR."
https://openalex.org/W3092446774,"The present study demonstrated a noninvasive preocular sensor system for the concurrent monitoring of diabetes and one of its prevalent complications, dry eye syndrome (DES), using tear fluids. Two distinct sensors, i.e., the glucose and DES sensors, were prepared and encased together in a single housing unit to produce the sensor system, and the tip was designed to be in contact with the eye surface noninvasively to collect and deliver tear fluid to the sensors. The glucose sensor was modified from a commercially available electrochemical sensor to allow for the measurement of glucose concentrations, even in a small amount of collected tear fluid. The DES sensor was equipped with a microchannel spaced with two parallel electrodes to determine the amount of collected tear fluid. In vivo experimental results revealed that with the collected tear fluid of about 0.6–1.0 μl, the sensor system estimated the blood glucose concentrations with acceptable accuracy compared with that of the glucometer in clinical use. The DES condition in animals was diagnosed with high sensitivity (91.7%) and specificity (83.3%)."

https://openalex.org/W3091950574,"To detect false data injection attacks (FDIAs) in power grid reconstruction and solve the problem of high data dimension and bad abnormal data processing in the power system, thereby achieving safe and stable operation of the power grid system, this study introduces machine learning methods to explore the detection of FDIAs. First, through the utilization of the standard IEEE node system and the simulation of FDIAs under the condition of non-complete topology information, the construction of the attack data set is completed, and the MatPower tool is applied to simulate and analyze the data set. Second, based on the isolated Forest (iForest) abnormal score data processing algorithm combined with the Local Linear Embedding (LLE) data dimensionality reduction method, an algorithm for data feature extraction is constructed. Finally, based on the combination of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, an algorithm model for FDIAs detection is constructed. The results show that in the IEEE14-bus node and IEEE118-bus node systems, the overall distribution of the state estimated before and after the attack vector injection is consistent with the initial value. In the iFores algorithm, the number of iTree and the number of samples affect the extraction of abnormal score data. When the number of iTree n is determined to be 100, and the corresponding number of samples w is determined to be 10, the algorithm has the best detection effect. The FDIAs detection algorithm model based on CNN-GRU shows good detection effects under high attack intensity, with an accuracy rate of more than 95%, and its performance is better than other traditional detection algorithms. In this study, the bad data detection model based on deep learning has an active role in the realization of the safe and stable operation of the smart grid."
https://openalex.org/W3091953739,"In the post-natal mammalian brain perivascular astrocytes (PAs) ensheath blood vessels to regulate their unique permeability properties known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Very little is known about PA-expressed genes and signaling pathways that mediate contact and communication with endothelial cells (ECs) to regulate BBB physiology. This is due, in part, to lack of suitable models to distinguish PAs from other astrocyte sub-populations in the brain. To decipher the unique biology of PAs, we used in vivo gene knock-in technology to fluorescently label these cells in the adult mouse brain followed by fractionation and quantitative single cell RNA sequencing. In addition, PAs and non-PAs were also distinguished with transgenic fluorescent reporters followed by gene expression comparisons using bulk RNA sequencing. These efforts have identified several genes and pathways in PAs with potential roles in contact and communication with brain ECs. These genes encode various extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and adhesion receptors, secreted growth factors, and intracellular signaling enzymes. Collectively, our experimental data reveal a set of genes that are expressed in PAs with putative roles in BBB physiology."
https://openalex.org/W3092493028,"Background and aims The incidence of hepatitis E virus (HEV)-infections in industrialized nations has been increasing over the past years. Patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) may be more prone to transmission. Data on HEV seroprevalence in IBD patients is scarce and has not been reported in German IBD patients. The German Health Examination Survey for Adults 2008–2011, which included 4.422 samples, found a HEV seroprevalence of 16.8%, increasing with age. The aim of the present study was to determine the seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG in a German cohort of IBD patients, and to explore which parameters have an impact on HEV seroprevalence. Material and methods This is an uncontrolled, cross-sectional, retrospective monocentric study. Among the patients visiting the IBD outpatient clinic between 25 January, 2019 and 24 September, 2019, 328 patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) and 150 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) were included in the study. IgG antibodies against HEV were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Positive antibody titers were verified using immunoblot analysis. Medical records were reviewed for demographic and clinical parameters to identify potential risk factors for HEV infection. Results The prevalence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies was 17.4% in CD patients and 24.7% in UC patients. No patient with positive HEV PCR was detected. Greater age of CD und UC patients and longer duration of anti-interleukin 12/23 treatment in CD patients were associated with higher anti-HEV IgG antibody rates. Conclusions In summary, we conclude that patients with UC have a higher anti-HEV IgG antibody prevalence than the general population in Germany, and that immunosuppressive therapy may carry no higher risk for HEV infection."
https://openalex.org/W3092272054,"Bushmeat is a major source of protein and income in tropical regions but is often over-harvested. A better monitoring of bushmeat stocks could help achieve sustainability. We used a combination of simulations and transect survey data collected from blue duikers (Philantomba monticola) in the Lomako wildlife reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo, to investigate the use of transect-based distance sampling to monitor bushmeat stocks. The comparison of dung piles and direct observations of duikers evidenced that animals avoided both the transects in the absence of observers, and the observers themselves. This type of behavioural response appeared common in a literature survey. It causes a negative bias in the estimates of population densities from the standard distance sampling methodology. This negative bias would lead to over-pessimistic predictions of population viability, especially if the behavioural response is more intense in the locations where the animals are hunted. In turn, this would lead to excessively conservative management recommendations. To correct for the effect of the behavioural response of the animals to either the transects or the observers, we recommend recording both the forward and perpendicular distances to the observers (2D distance sampling), not just the perpendicular distance. We also recommend multiple-observer protocols. As a cautionary note, we also demonstrate a scenario where the intensity of the behavioural response is too high to reliably estimate the abundance of the population. As a perspective, we outline the general principles of a local stakeholder-based program combining distance sampling with less intensive types of ecological indicators to monitor wildlife populations."
https://openalex.org/W3092526237,"Introduction Tuberculosis disease is the leading cause of death worldwide along with HIV/AIDS. Sputum smear microscopy plays an essential role for initial TB diagnosis and treatment follow up. But, misdiagnosis of sputum smear microscopy revealed a high economical crisis and missing of active TB cases. This study was aimed to determine blinded rechecking of sputum smear microscopy performance in public health facilities in Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia. Materials and methods A cross sectional retrospective study was conducted from January, 2017 to December, 2018 year. Data was collected retrospectively using electronic and paper based in Tigray health research institute. The data was analyzed using the SPSS version 25 software. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the smear readings were calculated using 2X2 contingency table. The reading agreement between the microscopic center and reference center was determined using kappa statistics. Results A total of 23,456 blinded rechecked smear results were reviewed. In average, the performances of sputum smear quality were 61%, 68%, 64%, 66%, 62% and 75% for specimen quality, staining quality, smear size, smear thickness, smear evenness and smear cleanliness respectively. Of the total error (0.48%) reported, 0.25%, 0.19% and 0.085% were false positive, false negative and quantification errors respectively. The concordance rate of health facilities for smear reading was increased to 90% by the end of 2018. Overall, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the smear readings were 95%, 99.7%, 93% and 99.8% respectively. Likewise, the smear reading agreement was also perfect with kappa value, 0.87. Conclusion The overall performance of public health facilities for blinded rechecking of smear microscopy was satisfactory. But, the high false positive and false negative errors found calls for continuous evaluation and monitoring of the health facilities by reference center."
https://openalex.org/W3091957085,"OBJECTIVE Detachment from the workforce following open heart valve surgery is a burden for the patient and society. The objectives were to examine patterns of employment status at different time points and to investigate factors associated with a lower likelihood of returning to the workforce within six months. METHODS A cohort study of patients aged 18-63 undergoing valvular surgery at a Danish tertiary centre from 2013-2017. Return to the workforce was defined as being employed, unemployed (still capable of working) or receiving paid leave of absence. The association between demographic-, clinical characteristics (including a surgical risk evaluation, EuroScore), and return to the workforce were investigated with a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS In total, 1,395 consecutive patients underwent surgery, 347 were between 18 and 63 years and eligible for inclusion. Of those, 282 were attached to the workforce before surgery and included in the study. At the time of surgery, 79% were on paid sick leave. After six months, 21% of the patients (being part of the workforce before surgery), were still on sick leave. In the regression model, prolonged sick leave prior to surgery (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.79) and EuroScore ≥ 2.3 (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21-0.74) significantly reduced the likelihood of returning to the workforce. CONCLUSION One-fifth of patients in the working-age were on sick leave six months after surgery. Prolonged sick leave prior to surgery and a EuroScore ≥2.3 were associated with a lower likelihood of returning to the workforce."
https://openalex.org/W3092271359,"Background HIV diagnosis is a watershed in women's childbearing experience. It is usually accompanied by the fear of death and stigmatisation. Women diagnosed of HIV are often sceptical about pregnancy. Meanwhile, availability of antiretroviral treatments has impacted positively on childbearing experience among women living with HIV. We therefore investigated the timing of first childbirth after HIV diagnosis and its determinants among women in Ibadan, Nigeria. Methods We extracted and analysed data from a 2015 cross-sectional study on childbearing progression among 933 women living with HIV and receiving care at University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. Extended Cox proportional hazards regression, a semi-parametric event history model was used at 5% significance level. Results The women's mean age was 38.1 (± SD = 6.1) years and the median time to first birth after HIV diagnosis (FBI_HIV) was 8 years. The likelihood of first birth after HIV diagnosis was lower among women who desired more children (HR = 0.63, CI: 0.51-0.78). Women whose partners had primary and secondary education respectively were about 2.3 times more likely to shorten FBI_HIV compared to those whose partners had no formal education. Knowledge of partner's HIV-positive status (HR = 1.42, CI: 1.04,1.93) increased the likelihood of having a first birth after HIV diagnosis. Older age, longer duration on ART and a higher number of children at diagnosis were associated with a declined hazard of first birth after HIV diagnosis. Conclusions The median time to first childbirth after HIV diagnosis was long. Partner's HIV-positive status and higher educational attainment were associated with early childbearing after HIV diagnosis."

More precisely, we compare the observed extraction levels produced as a result of three mechanisms: a mandatory information sharing mechanism and two voluntary information sharing mechanisms that differ in the degree of freedom given to the players. Our main result is that a voluntary information sharing mechanism could help in reaching a lower average extraction level than that observed with the mandatory mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W3092310564,"Objective We aim to propose a novel method of evaluating the degree of rhythmic irregularity during repetitive tasks in Parkinson’s disease (PD) by using autocorrelation to extract serial perturbation in the periodicity of body part movements as recorded by objective devices. Methods We used publicly distributed sequential joint movement data recorded during a leg agility task or pronation-supination task. The sequences of body part trajectory were processed to extract their short-time autocorrelation (STACF) matrices; the sequences of single task conducted by participants were then divided into two clusters according to their similarity in terms of their STACF representation. The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale sub-score rated for each task was compared with cluster membership to obtain the area under the curve (AUC) to evaluate the discrimination performance of the clustering. We compared the AUC with those obtained from the clustering of the raw sequence or short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Results In classifying the pose estimator-based trajectory data of the knee during the leg agility task, the AUC was the highest when the STACF sequence was used for clustering instead of other types of sequences with up to 0.815, being comparable to the results reported in the original analysis of the data using an approach different from ours. In addition, in classifying another dataset of accelerometer-based trajectory data of the wrist during a pronation-supination task, the AUC was again highest up to 0.785 when clustering was performed using the STACF rather than other types of sequence. Conclusion Our autocorrelation-based method achieved a fair performance in detecting sequences with irregular rhythm, suggesting that it might be used as another evaluation strategy that is potentially widely applicable to qualify the disordered rhythm of PD regardless of the kinds of task or the modality of devices, although further refinement is needed."
