https://openalex.org/W2162445149,"Eukaryotes have evolved complex mechanisms to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through coordinated actions of protein sensors, transducers, and effectors. Here we show that ∼21-nucleotide small RNAs are produced from the sequences in the vicinity of DSB sites in Arabidopsis and in human cells. We refer to these as diRNAs for DSB-induced small RNAs. In Arabidopsis, the biogenesis of diRNAs requires the PI3 kinase ATR, RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), and Dicer-like proteins. Mutations in these proteins as well as in Pol V cause significant reduction in DSB repair efficiency. In Arabidopsis, diRNAs are recruited by Argonaute 2 (AGO2) to mediate DSB repair. Knock down of Dicer or Ago2 in human cells reduces DSB repair. Our findings reveal a conserved function for small RNAs in the DSB repair pathway. We propose that diRNAs may function as guide molecules directing chromatin modifications or the recruitment of protein complexes to DSB sites to facilitate repair.

DSB induces production of small RNAs (diRNAs) around the DSB site in Arabidopsis DiRNA biogenesis and functioning require Pol IV, Pol V, DCLs, and AGO2 in Arabidopsis DiRNAs play an important role in DSB repair in Arabidopsis DiRNA-mediated DSB repair is conserved in plants and humans DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are deleterious forms of DNA damage that can cause mutations, genome instability, and cell death. Efficient repair of DSBs is thus critical for the maintenance of genome integrity and cell survival. DSBs are mainly repaired by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR) (Ciccia and Elledge, 2010Ciccia A. Elledge S.J.

NHEJ repairs DSBs in an efficient but error-prone fashion. It can cause deletions or insertions at the break site because of the modification of DNA ends before joining (Lieber, 2010Lieber M.R.

In contrast, HR is considered error free, but it requires resection of the DSB and a sister chromatid as template for repair (Moynahan and Jasin, 2010Moynahan M.E. Jasin M.

Single-strand annealing (SSA) is a particular type of HR that takes place when DSB resection occurs at repetitive sequences, providing complementary single strands that can then anneal (Ciccia and Elledge, 2010Ciccia A.

These repair pathways all require well-regulated and coordinated enzymatic actions of protein sensors, transducers, and effectors in the DSB signaling cascade (Ciccia and Elledge, 2010Ciccia A.

Small RNAs have emerged as key players in various aspects of biology. Three major classes of small RNAs have been discovered in eukaryotes: microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). miRNAs and siRNAs are processed by RNase III domain-containing Dicer or Dicer-like (DCL) proteins from their double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors. Via association with members of the Argonaute (AGO) family, small RNAs mediate transcriptional or posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression (Baulcombe, 2004Baulcombe D. RNA silencing in plants.Nature. 2004; 431: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009Carthew R.W. Sontheimer E.J. Origins and Mechanisms of miRNAs and siRNAs.Cell. 2009; 136: 642-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar). AGO proteins contain several characteristic domains: a variable N-terminal domain and conserved PAZ, MID, and PIWI domains (Tolia and Joshua-Tor, 2007Tolia N.H. Joshua-Tor L. Slicer and the argonautes.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The PAZ and PIWI domains bind to the 3′ and 5′ ends of small RNAs, respectively (Ma et al., 2004Ma J.B. Ye K. Patel D.J.

Structural basis for 5′-end-specific recognition of guide RNA by the A. fulgidus Piwi protein.Nature. 2005; 434: 666-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and the PIWI domain has endonuclease activity when an Asp-Asp-His catalytic triad is present (Rivas et al., 2005Rivas F.V. Tolia N.H. Song J.J. Aragon J.P. Liu J. Hannon G.J. Joshua-Tor L. Purified Argonaute2 and an siRNA form recombinant human RISC.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Crystal structure of Argonaute and its implications for RISC slicer activity.Science. 2004; 305: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). In plants, the most abundant small RNAs are heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs) derived from transposons and other repetitive sequences. Single-stranded RNA transcripts are presumably generated from DNA repeats by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) (Herr et al., 2005Herr A.J. Jensen M.B. Dalmay T. Baulcombe D.C. RNA polymerase IV directs silencing of endogenous DNA.Science. 2005; 308: 118-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, Onodera et al., 2005Onodera Y. Haag J.R. Ream T. Costa Nunes P. Pontes O.

Johansen L.K. Gustafson A.M. Kasschau K.D. Lellis A.D. Zilberman D. Jacobsen S.E. Carrington J.C. Genetic and functional diversification of small RNA pathways in plants.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), which are in turn processed by DCL3 into 24 nucleotide (nt) hc-siRNAs (Xie et al., 2004Xie Z. Johansen L.K. Gustafson A.M. Kasschau K.D. Lellis A.D. Zilberman D. Jacobsen S.E. Carrington J.C. Genetic and functional diversification of small RNA pathways in plants.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Hc-siRNAs are associated with AGO4 subfamily members and direct DNA methylation by the de novo DNA methyltransferase DRM2 through a pathway known as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) (Law and Jacobsen, 2010Law J.A.

Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Functionally analogous to plant hc-siRNAs, piRNAs are specific to animals and most often specifically generated in the germ line to inactivate transposons (Malone and Hannon, 2009Malone C.D. Hannon G.J. Small RNAs as guardians of the genome.Cell. 2009; 136: 656-668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In addition to these three classes of small RNAs, other types of small RNAs have also been found in various organisms. Tetrahymera thermophila contains scan RNAs (scnRNAs) that are involved in developmentally regulated DNA elimination (Mochizuki and Gorovsky, 2004Mochizuki K.

More recently, high-throughput approaches have identified promoter-associated short RNAs (PASRs) (Kapranov et al., 2007Kapranov P. Cheng J. Dike S. Nix D.A. Duttagupta R. Willingham A.T. Stadler P.F.

Glazov E.A. Cloonan N. Simons C. Stephen S. Faulkner G.J. Lassmann T. Forrest A.R. Grimmond S.M. Schroder K. et al.Tiny RNAs associated with transcription start sites in animals.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) in animals. In light of the expanding universe of small RNAs and their increasingly diverse biological roles, we explored whether small RNAs could play a role in DSB repair. Using well-established reporter assays for DSB repair in Arabidopsis thaliana and human cells, we found that DSBs trigger the production of small RNAs from the sequences in the vicinity of DSB sites and these small RNAs are required for efficient DSB repair. Our results reveal an unsuspected and conserved role for small RNAs in the DSB repair pathway. We used an Arabidopsis transgenic line carrying the DGU.US reporter in which expression of the endonuclease I-SceI, induced by crossing, introduces a single DSB in the genome (Mannuss et al., 2010Mannuss A. Dukowic-Schulze S. Suer S. Hartung F. Pacher M. Puchta H.

Different pathways of homologous recombination are used for the repair of double-strand breaks within tandemly arranged sequences in the plant genome.Plant J. 2003; 35: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Repair of the DSB through SSA mechanism restores β-glucuronidase (GUS) expression, which provides a visible and quantitative readout of DSB repair events (Figure 1A ). Confirming published results (Mannuss et al., 2010Mannuss A. Dukowic-Schulze S. Suer S. Hartung F. Pacher M. Puchta H.

We then introduced, via crossing, this reporter system into an Arabidopsis atr mutant background to assay the DSB repair rate in this mutant (Figure S1, available online). ATR encodes a phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase-like protein kinase (PI3 kinase) that primarily responds to stalled replication forks and also acts with ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated, another PI3 kinase) in DSB response (Amiard et al., 2010Amiard S.

Then plants R/R; m/m were crossed with T/T; m/m, whereas the corresponding WT siblings R/R; M/M were crossed with T/T; M/M.

HPT: hygromycin phosphotransferase gene. (B) Model for DSB repair through SDSA pathway. DCLs are required for small RNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis (Xie et al., 2004Xie Z. Johansen L.K. Gustafson A.M. Kasschau K.D. Lellis A.D. Zilberman D. Jacobsen S.E. Carrington J.C. Genetic and functional diversification of small RNA pathways in plants.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). We next examined whether DCLs are involved in DSB repair. We introduced the GUS reporter system into dcl2, dcl3, and dcl4 mutant backgrounds. Intriguingly, compared with those in the wild-type controls, the repair rates were reduced by 42%, 90%, and 44% in the dcl2, dcl3, and dcl4 mutant backgrounds, respectively (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1E), suggesting that DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 play partially redundant roles in DSB repair and that DCL3 is the major player. The requirement of DCLs for efficient DSB repair suggested the involvement of small RNAs in this process. Thus, we sought to examine whether small RNAs were produced from the sequences around the DSB site by northern blot analysis. When a probe that recognizes the ∼450 nt sequence flanking the I-SceI site (Figure 1A) was used, small RNAs were barely detectable in the R or T line but were readily detected in the progenies of RxT cross (Figure 2A ). These small RNAs were named diRNAs for DSB-induced small RNAs. Deep sequencing analyses revealed that diRNAs were specifically derived from both sense and antisense strands of the sequence around the I-SceI site (Figure 2B). Confirming the northern blot results, ∼40 times more diRNA reads were obtained from the RxT sample compared to those from the uncrossed R line (Figure 2B), whereas the expression profiles of endogenous small RNAs (miRNAs and siRNAs) were comparable in these two samples (Table S1). Moreover, we found that the production of diRNAs was dependent on ATR. In the atr mutant background, the diRNAs were barely detectable either by northern blot (Figure 2C) or deep sequencing (Table S2). We extended the diRNA analysis to another DSB repair reporter (DU.GUS) system (Orel et al., 2003Orel N. Kyryk A. Puchta H. Different pathways of homologous recombination are used for the repair of double-strand breaks within tandemly arranged sequences in the plant genome.Plant J. 2003; 35: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this system, the DSB site generated by I-SceI digestion is repaired by the HR pathway that involves gene conversion through synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA). We detected the production of diRNAs in the DU.GUSxT plants by deep sequencing (Figure 2D). The amount of diRNAs produced in the DU.GUSxT plants was approximately one-fifth of that detected in the RxT plants (Figures 2B and 2D). This is in correlation with the lower DSB repair frequency in the DU.GUS line, which has been reported to be about five times lower than that in the DGU.US line (Orel et al., 2003Orel N. Kyryk A. Puchta H. Different pathways of homologous recombination are used for the repair of double-strand breaks within tandemly arranged sequences in the plant genome.Plant J. 2003; 35: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Taken together, these observations demonstrate that DSBs induce the production of diRNAs specifically around the DSB sites. To investigate the role of diRNAs in DSB repair, we first examined the production of diRNAs in the dcl mutants that had reduced repair rates (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1E). Compared to the wild-type controls, dcl2, dcl3, and dcl4 accumulated many fewer diRNAs (Figure 3A and Table S2). In particular, the production of diRNAs was reduced by 98% in the dcl3 mutant, consistent with its predominant effect on the repair efficiency (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1E). DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are known to process dsRNAs into 22 nt, 24 nt, and 21 nt siRNAs, respectively (Qi et al., 2005Qi Y. Denli A.M. Hannon G.J. Biochemical specialization within Arabidopsis RNA silencing pathways.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 421-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, Xie et al., 2004Xie Z. Johansen L.K. Gustafson A.M. Kasschau K.D. Lellis A.D. Zilberman D. Jacobsen S.E. Carrington J.C. Genetic and functional diversification of small RNA pathways in plants.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that the production of both 21 nt and 24 nt siRNAs was greatly reduced in each of the dcl mutants (Figure 3A). This suggests that diRNAs might be processed from their dsRNA precursors through coordinated actions of DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4. Coordinated actions of DCLs have been previously shown for the biogenesis of long miRNAs in rice (Wu et al., 2010Wu L. Zhou H. Zhang Q. Zhang J. Ni F. Liu C. Qi Y. DNA methylation mediated by a microRNA pathway.Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The generation of diRNAs from both sense and antisense strands at approximately equal frequency (Figure 2B) suggested that they were processed from dsRNA precursors, the production of which usually requires RDRs (Xie et al., 2004Xie Z. Johansen L.K. Gustafson A.M. Kasschau K.D. Lellis A.D. Zilberman D. Jacobsen S.E. Carrington J.C. Genetic and functional diversification of small RNA pathways in plants.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). RDR2 is required for the production of hc-siRNAs (Xie et al., 2004Xie Z. Johansen L.K. Gustafson A.M. Kasschau K.D. Lellis A.D. Zilberman D. Jacobsen S.E. Carrington J.C. Genetic and functional diversification of small RNA pathways in plants.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), whereas RDR6 plays a role in the biogenesis of trans-acting siRNAs (Peragine et al., 2004Peragine A. Yoshikawa M. Wu G. Albrecht H.L. Poethig R.S. SGS3 and SGS2/SDE1/RDR6 are required for juvenile development and the production of trans-acting siRNAs in Arabidopsis.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2368-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, Vazquez et al., 2004Vazquez F. Vaucheret H. Rajagopalan R. Lepers C. Gasciolli V. Mallory A.C. Hilbert J.L. Bartel D.P. Crété P. Endogenous trans-acting siRNAs regulate the accumulation of Arabidopsis mRNAs.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 69-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). We found that mutations in RDR2 and RDR6 caused 87% and 82% reductions in diRNA production, respectively (Figure 3A and Table S2). However, these mutations had no significant effects on the repair efficiency (Figures 3B and 3C and Figure S3), which could indicate a redundancy between RDR2 and RDR6 or that other RDRs are involved. Alternatively, these findings could also imply that there might be a threshold of diRNA abundance required for its function in DSB repair and that the levels of diRNAs present in the rdr2 and rdr6 mutants are sufficient. We next examined whether Pol IV and Pol V are required for diRNA biogenesis and DSB repair. Pol IV and Pol V are both involved in the Arabidopsis RdDM pathway. Pol IV is required for hc-siRNA biogenesis (Herr et al., 2005Herr A.J. Jensen M.B. Dalmay T. Baulcombe D.C.

Intriguingly, diRNA production was greatly compromised in nrpd1 (NRPD1 encodes the largest subunit of Pol IV) but increased in nrpe1 (NRPE1 encodes the largest subunit of Pol V) (Figure 3A and Table S2). Repair rates were reduced by 80% and 50% in the nrpd1 and nrpe1 mutant backgrounds, respectively (Figures 3B and 3C and Figure S3). These data indicate that Pol IV and Pol V are involved in DSB repair through regulating diRNA biogenesis and functioning, respectively. DCL3, Pol IV, and Pol V are all components in the RdDM pathway (Law and Jacobsen, 2010Law J.A. Jacobsen S.E.

Microarray analysis of individual cortical layers across sensorimotor and association cortices identified robust and specific molecular signatures for individual cortical layers and areas, prominently involving genes associated with specialized neuronal function. Overall, transcriptome-based relationships were related to spatial proximity, being strongest between neighboring cortical areas and between proximal layers. Primary visual cortex (V1) displayed the most distinctive gene expression compared to other cortical regions in rhesus and human, both in the specialized layer 4 as well as other layers. Laminar patterns were more similar between macaque and human compared to mouse, as was the unique V1 profile that was not observed in mouse. These data provide a unique resource detailing neocortical transcription patterns in a nonhuman primate with great similarity in gene expression to human."
https://openalex.org/W1973752700,"The emergence of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) contributes to the high mortality of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa), which in part could be attributed to the existence and the emergence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recent studies have shown that deregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) contributes to the initiation and progression of PCa. Among several known miRNAs, let-7 family appears to play a key role in the recurrence and progression of PCa by regulating CSCs; however, the mechanism by which let-7 family contributes to PCa aggressiveness is unclear. Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a putative target of let-7 family, was demonstrated to control stem cell function. In this study, we found loss of let-7 family with corresponding over-expression of EZH2 in human PCa tissue specimens, especially in higher Gleason grade tumors. Overexpression of let-7 by transfection of let-7 precursors decreased EZH2 expression and repressed clonogenic ability and sphere-forming capacity of PCa cells, which was consistent with inhibition of EZH2 3'UTR luciferase activity. We also found that the treatment of PCa cells with BR-DIM (formulated DIM: 3,3'-diindolylmethane by Bio Response, Boulder, CO, abbreviated as BR-DIM) up-regulated let-7 and down-regulated EZH2 expression, consistent with inhibition of self-renewal and clonogenic capacity. Moreover, BR-DIM intervention in our on-going phase II clinical trial in patients prior to radical prostatectomy showed upregulation of let-7 consistent with down-regulation of EZH2 expression in PCa tissue specimens after BR-DIM intervention. These results suggest that the loss of let-7 mediated increased expression of EZH2 contributes to PCa aggressiveness, which could be attenuated by BR-DIM treatment, and thus BR-DIM is likely to have clinical impact."
https://openalex.org/W1980656534,"The chaperonin GroEL assists the folding of nascent or stress-denatured polypeptides by actions of binding and encapsulation. ATP binding initiates a series of conformational changes triggering the association of the cochaperonin GroES, followed by further large movements that eject the substrate polypeptide from hydrophobic binding sites into a GroES-capped, hydrophilic folding chamber. We used cryo-electron microscopy, statistical analysis, and flexible fitting to resolve a set of distinct GroEL-ATP conformations that can be ordered into a trajectory of domain rotation and elevation. The initial conformations are likely to be the ones that capture polypeptide substrate. Then the binding domains extend radially to separate from each other but maintain their binding surfaces facing the cavity, potentially exerting mechanical force upon kinetically trapped, misfolded substrates. The extended conformation also provides a potential docking site for GroES, to trigger the final, 100° domain rotation constituting the ""power stroke"" that ejects substrate into the folding chamber."
https://openalex.org/W2073654379,"Background Recent studies suggest that betaKlotho (KLB) and endocrine FGF19 and FGF21 redirect FGFR signaling to regulation of metabolic homeostasis and suppression of obesity and diabetes. However, the identity of the predominant metabolic tissue in which a major FGFR-KLB resides that critically mediates the differential actions and metabolism effects of FGF19 and FGF21 remain unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings We determined the receptor and tissue specificity of FGF21 in comparison to FGF19 by using direct, sensitive and quantitative binding kinetics, and downstream signal transduction and expression of early response gene upon administration of FGF19 and FGF21 in mice. We found that FGF21 binds FGFR1 with much higher affinity than FGFR4 in presence of KLB; while FGF19 binds both FGFR1 and FGFR4 in presence of KLB with comparable affinity. The interaction of FGF21 with FGFR4-KLB is very weak even at high concentration and could be negligible at physiological concentration. Both FGF19 and FGF21 but not FGF1 exhibit binding affinity to KLB. The binding of FGF1 is dependent on where FGFRs are present. Both FGF19 and FGF21 are unable to displace the FGF1 binding, and conversely FGF1 cannot displace FGF19 and FGF21 binding. These results indicate that KLB is an indispensable mediator for the binding of FGF19 and FGF21 to FGFRs that is not required for FGF1. Although FGF19 can predominantly activate the responses of the liver and to a less extent the adipose tissue, FGF21 can do so significantly only in the adipose tissue and adipocytes. Among several metabolic and endocrine tissues, the response of adipose tissue to FGF21 is predominant, and can be blunted by the ablation of KLB or FGFR1. Conclusions Our results indicate that unlike FGF19, FGF21 is unable to bind FGFR4-KLB complex with affinity comparable to FGFR1-KLB, and therefore, at physiological concentration less likely to directly and significantly target the liver where FGFR4-KLB predominantly resides. However, both FGF21 and FGF19 have the potential to activate responses of primarily the adipose tissue where FGFR1-KLB resides."

On the other hand, cellular correlates of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP), are diminished by stroke (Sopala et al., 2000Sopala M. Frankiewicz T. Parsons C. Danysz W.

These observations suggest that recovery might be enhanced not only by dampening inflammation, but also by increasing synaptic and structural plasticity. Recently, we discovered that mice lacking major histocompatibility class I (MHCI) function have enhanced visual cortical and hippocampal plasticity not only in development, but also in adulthood (Corriveau et al., 1998Corriveau R.A.

USA. 2009; 106: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An innate immune receptor, PirB (paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B) is known to bind MHCI both in neurons (Syken et al., 2006Syken J. Grandpre T. Kanold P.O. Shatz C.J. PirB restricts ocular-dominance plasticity in visual cortex.Science. 2006; 313: 1795-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and in the immune system (Matsushita et al., 2011Matsushita H. Endo S. Kobayashi E. Sakamoto Y. Kobayashi K. Kitaguchi K. Kuroki K. Söderhäll A. Maenaka K. Nakamura A. et al.Differential but competitive binding of Nogo protein and class i major histocompatibility complex (MHCI) to the PIR-B ectodomain provides an inhibition of cells.J. Biol.

Paired immunoglobulin-like receptors and their MHC class I recognition.Immunology. 2005; 115: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Like Kb and Db, PirB is expressed in forebrain neurons, and PirB KO mice also have greater visual cortical plasticity (Syken et al., 2006Syken J. Grandpre T. Kanold P.O. Shatz C.J. PirB restricts ocular-dominance plasticity in visual cortex.Science. 2006; 313: 1795-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). MHCI molecules are upregulated by inflammation both in the immune system and in the CNS after damage or viral infection (Piehl and Lidman, 2001Piehl F. Lidman O. Neuroinflammation in the rat—CNS cells and their role in the regulation of immune reactions.Immunol. Rev. 2001; 184: 212-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, Thams et al., 2008Thams S. Oliveira A. Cullheim S. MHC class I expression and synaptic plasticity after nerve lesion.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2008; 57: 265-269Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because these molecules play a dual role in the peripheral immune response and in neural plasticity in the CNS, they could be involved not only in the acute phases of stroke, but also in subsequent recovery. After stroke, these molecules might make a dual contribution to exacerbate damage in the context of the inflammatory response and to restrict recovery by limiting plasticity. Here, we investigate these possibilities by examining response to in vivo and in vitro models of stroke in PirB KO mice and KbDb KO mice. To examine whether Kb and Db contribute to damage after stroke, we gave adult KbDb KO mice (Vugmeyster et al., 1998Vugmeyster Y. Glas R. Pérarnau B. Lemonnier F.A. Eisen H. Ploegh H. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I KbDb -/- deficient mice possess functional CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 12492-12497Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; Han et al., 2009Han R.Q. Ouyang Y.B. Xu L. Agrawal R. Patterson A.J. Giffard R.G. Postischemic brain injury is attenuated in mice lacking the beta2-adrenergic receptor.Anesth. Analg. 2009; 108: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). KbDb KO mice subjected to MCAO had no significant difference from wild-type (WT) in infarct area at 24 hr postinjury (37% versus 41%; p = 0.45; Figure 1A ), and their initial neurological deficit was also similar (p = 0.4; see Figure S1A available online; Han et al., 2009Han R.Q. Ouyang Y.B. Xu L. Agrawal R. Patterson A.J. Giffard R.G. Postischemic brain injury is attenuated in mice lacking the beta2-adrenergic receptor.Anesth. Analg. 2009; 108: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, by 7 days post-MCAO, infarct area in KbDb KO mice was modestly reduced (32%) compared to WT (44%; p = 0.03). Physiological parameters monitored during surgery were similar between WT and KO and fell within previously reported ranges (Table S1; Han et al., 2009Han R.Q. Ouyang Y.B. Xu L. Agrawal R. Patterson A.J. Giffard R.G. Postischemic brain injury is attenuated in mice lacking the beta2-adrenergic receptor.Anesth. Analg. 2009; 108: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To examine motor recovery after MCAO, we tested KbDb KO and WT mice on two motor performance tasks, rotarod and foot fault. Prior to MCAO, KO and WT mice learned both tasks, improving performance over subsequent trials, as evidenced by the increased latency to fall from the rotarod (Figure S1B) and fewer missteps on foot fault (Figure S1C). KO mice learned both behaviors better than WT (p < 0.001), consistent with prior observations of enhanced motor learning (McConnell et al., 2009McConnell M.J. Huang Y.H. Datwani A. Shatz C.J. H2-K(b) and H2-D(b) regulate cerebellar long-term depression and limit motor learning.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After stroke, performance on rotarod and foot fault was significantly better in KO mice versus WT (p < 0.001 for both paradigms; Figures 1B and 1C). Overall, KbDb KO mice had smaller infarcts and recovered significantly faster and to a greater extent on motor performance (to 91% of prestroke rotarod time compared to 75% for WT at 28 days). The observations that KbDb KO mice have smaller infarct areas and better behavioral recovery after MCAO suggest that Kb and Db may contribute to damage in WT mice. Moreover, because mice lacking Kb and Db have enhanced synaptic plasticity, it is conceivable that increased expression would contribute to diminished plasticity, thereby compromising recovery. To examine this idea further, we assessed MHCI levels after MCAO. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed highly increased Kb and Db mRNA in the damaged hemisphere (ipsi) compared to sham control after MCAO (Figure 2A ) both at 24 hr (Kb mRNA: 2.5-fold increase, p < 0.05; Db mRNA: 3.1-fold increase, p < 0.001) and at 7 days (Kb mRNA: 8.0-fold increase, p < 0.01; Db mRNA: 7.0-fold increase, p < 0.001). Kb and Db levels in the damaged hemisphere were also over 2-fold higher than levels in the undamaged hemisphere at 24 hr post-MCAO and over 5-fold higher 7 days post-MCAO (Figure 1A; p < 0.01). Western blot analysis of Kb expression in both synaptosome-enriched samples or synaptoneurosomes demonstrated increased protein levels after MCAO in the damaged hemisphere relative to the undamaged side or sham (Figures 2B and 2C). Because synaptoneurosomes enrich for synaptic proteins (Johnson et al., 1997Johnson M.W. Chotiner J.K. Watson J.B. Isolation and characterization of synaptoneurosomes from single rat hippocampal slices.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 77: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) after MCAO, Kb protein could be upregulated at synapses and also possibly within glial processes that enwrap the synapse. Previous studies have shown that MHCI proteins are expressed in neurons and are closely associated with synaptic markers in the healthy brain (Datwani et al., 2009Datwani A. McConnell M.J. Kanold P.O. Micheva K.D. Busse B. Shamloo M. Smith S.J. Shatz C.J.

Staining is not detected in astrocytes or microglia (Figures 2D and 2E; Figure S2). As expected, there is evidence of both astrocytic and microglial activation post-MCAO (Figure 2E). Together, these observations demonstrate that Kb and Db are upregulated after MCAO and that within the cortical penumbra, this upregulation is associated with increased protein expression in neurons and at or near synapses. To explore further how absence of Kb and Db in the brain might lead to neuroprotection, we next examined mice lacking the MHCI receptor PirB (Shatz, 2009Shatz C.J. MHC class I: an unexpected role in neuronal plasticity.Neuron. 2009; 64: 40-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Syken et al., 2006Syken J. Grandpre T. Kanold P.O.

Paired immunoglobulin-like receptors and their MHC class I recognition.Immunology. 2005; 115: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). PirB is expressed in CNS neurons, including pyramidal cells, throughout the cerebral cortex. Seven days post-MCAO, PirB KO mice had smaller infarcts than WT (KO: 18% versus WT: 35%; p = 0.0001), even though infarct area was the same at 24 hr post-MCAO (Figure 3A ). Between 1 to 7 days post-MCAO, infarct area in PirB KO mice decreased significantly (by 51%), as assessed by cresyl violet staining. Because cresyl violet stains acidic cellular components, particularly polyribosomes (Türeyen et al., 2004Türeyen K. Vemuganti R. Sailor K.A. Dempsey R.J.

Methods. 2004; 139: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the decrease in infarct area in KO mice may reflect recovery of protein synthesis in stressed cells within the penumbra. In KbDb KO mice at 7 days post-MCAO, infarct area is also reduced compared to WT (KbDb KO: 32% versus WT: 44%; p = 0.03) but to a lesser degree than in PirB KO. Together, these data suggest that knockout of PirB has a similar or even greater effect on infarct size than when Kb and Db are deleted. To determine whether protection in PirB KO mice is also associated with improved motor performance, we assessed animals on rotarod and foot fault. Prior to MCAO, KO mice learned faster and remained on the rod longer than WT over the course of the pretraining period (p < 0.0001; Figure S1E; no genotype differences were observed with training on the foot fault task, p = 0.45; Figure S1F). After MCAO, PirB KO mice performed better than WT on rotarod (p = 0.001) and foot fault (p = 0.02) by 7 days post treatment; even at 2 days post-MCAO, KO mice performed better than WT on foot fault (p = 0.01; Figures 3B and 3C). Together, these observations in PirB KO mice are strikingly similar to those for KbDb KO mice, suggesting that knocking out a receptor for these two MHCI molecules results in strong neuroprotection most apparent 7 days post-MCAO. Experimentally and clinically, stroke is followed by an inflammatory response characterized by production of inflammatory cytokines, infiltration of leukocytes and monocytes, and activation of resident glial cells (Choe et al., 2011Choe C.U. Lardong K. Gelderblom M. Ludewig P. Leypoldt F. Koch-Nolte F. Gerloff C. Magnus T.

Role of glial cells in cerebral ischemia.Glia. 2005; 50: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although activated astrocytes and microglia can exert beneficial effects, inflammation can also compromise neuronal survival and worsen ischemic damage. To determine whether PirB deletion alters glial activation 7 days post-MCAO, we immunolabeled brain sections for astrocyte and microglia and/or macrophage markers, and the number of activated cells in the cortical penumbra (Figure 3D) were counted. The number of reactive astrocytes decreased in PirB KO versus WT (GFAP+: 26% decrease, p = 0.001; Figures 3E and 3F; Vimentin+: 32% decrease, p = 0.03; Figures S3A and S3C). In contrast, the number of microglia did not differ from WT (Figures S3B and S3D). Thus, the neuroprotection afforded by PirB deletion appears to be accompanied by diminished numbers of activated astrocytes, but not microglia, in the penumbra area. A decrease in Vimentin+ and GFAP+ reactive astrocytes has been associated with better regenerative capacity after spinal cord or traumatic brain injury (Menet et al., 2003Menet V. Prieto M. Privat A. Giménez y Ribotta M. Axonal plasticity and functional recovery after spinal cord injury in mice deficient in both glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5016-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The diminished astrocytic, but not microglial, activation might reflect the contribution of astrocytes to synaptic plasticity and their close association to synapses (Beattie et al., 2002Beattie E.C. Stellwagen D. Morishita W. Bresnahan J.C. Ha B.K. Von Zastrow M. Beattie M.S. Malenka R.C.

Rouach N. Astroglial networks: a step further in neuroglial and gliovascular interactions.Nat. Rev.

McAllister A.K. MHC class I molecules are present both pre- and postsynaptically in the visual cortex during postnatal development and in adulthood.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

MHC class I: an unexpected role in neuronal plasticity.Neuron. 2009; 64: 40-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that the astrocytic response after MCAO relies in part on PirB signaling. Because outcome is improved in PirB KO mice, we assessed whether PirB is upregulated in WT mice after MCAO. PirB protein levels are markedly increased in the damaged hemisphere post-MCAO, compared to the undamaged contralateral side or to sham controls (Figure 3G). Western blot analysis (input) verified the increase in Kb protein level in the damaged hemisphere (Figure 3H), similar to that observed in synaptosomes (Figure 2). In the damaged hemisphere, there is also a significant increase in β2m (Figure 3H). Because β2m is necessary for stable cell surface expression of the majority of MHCI proteins (Huh et al., 2000Huh G.S. Boulanger L.M. Du H. Riquelme P.A. Brotz T.M. Shatz C.J. Functional requirement for class I MHC in CNS development and plasticity.Science. 2000; 290: 2155-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), it is likely that the increase in levels of Kb and Db is accompanied by increased cell-surface expression after MCAO. MHCI binding to PirB facilitates tyrosine phosphorylation of PirB on cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, which in turn recruits SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases to PirB and modulates downstream signal transduction pathways (Nakamura et al., 2004Nakamura A. Kobayashi E. Takai T. Exacerbated graft-versus-host disease in Pirb-/- mice.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Takai, 2005Takai T. Paired immunoglobulin-like receptors and their MHC class I recognition.Immunology. 2005; 115: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether upregulation of Kb, Db, β2m, and PirB after MCAO is associated with known PirB signaling components in the brain (Syken et al., 2006Syken J. Grandpre T. Kanold P.O. Shatz C.J. PirB restricts ocular-dominance plasticity in visual cortex.Science. 2006; 313: 1795-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Both PirB phosphorylation and SHP-2 recruitment to PirB increase significantly after MCAO (Figures 3I and 3J). Thus, a notable consequence of MCAO is to engage the first key steps in PirB downstream signal transduction. PirB and KbDb KO mice have smaller infarcts and better motor recovery, suggesting that these molecules exert their deleterious effects in WT both by causing more cell death within the infarct and by limiting compensation via synaptic plasticity in surviving circuits. Because Kb, Db, and PirB also function in the immune system, the smaller infarcts seen in KO mice might arise from a dysregulated immune response (Maenaka and Jones, 1999Maenaka K. Jones E.Y. MHC superfamily structure and the immune system.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, Takai, 2005Takai T. Paired immunoglobulin-like receptors and their MHC class I recognition.Immunology. 2005; 115: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), rather than from absence of expression in the CNS. To examine this possibility, we employed an in vitro model of ischemia: 15 min of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) of hippocampal organotypic slice cultures. The slices contain resident astrocytes and microglia but few if any peripheral immune cells. Circulating neutrophils, which might be present initially within these slices, have life spans of only 8–20 hr, and so are gone prior to experiments, which start after 2 weeks in vitro; no new peripheral immune cells can infiltrate in response to injury. The extent of neuronal cell death was assessed directly in CA1 by using propidium iodide (PI) immunofluorescence 24 hr after OGD insult (Ouyang et al., 2007Ouyang Y.B. Voloboueva L.A. Xu L.J. Giffard R.G. Selective dysfunction of hippocampal CA1 astrocytes contributes to delayed neuronal damage after transient forebrain ischemia.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4253-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar; Figure 4A ). Despite the absence of peripheral immune system infiltration, cultures from KbDb WT mice sustained significant damage, whereas cell death was significantly reduced in cultures from KbDb KO mice, as indicated by a 55% decrease in average PI fluorescence intensity (KbDb KO: 38 ± 1.9 median pixel intensity versus WT: 89 ± 3.4; p < 0.0001; Figure 4A). Cultures from PirB KO mice also had less cell death than WT, visualized as a 54% decrease in average PI fluorescence intensity compared to WT (PirB KO: 64 ± 3.7 median pixel intensity versus WT: 141 ± 7.3; p < 0.0001; Figure 4B). These observations demonstrate that in vitro as well as in vivo, PirB, Kb, and Db contribute to damage after ischemia. In addition, results suggest that, in vivo, the absence of these molecules in brain cells (neurons and/or resident glia), rather than just in the peripheral immune system, is neuroprotective. Functional recovery after stroke is associated with axonal plasticity as well as with altered gene expression profiles (Lee et al., 2004Lee J.K. Kim J.E. Sivula M. Strittmatter S.M.

https://openalex.org/W2101090931,"Dendrite arborization and synapse formation are essential for wiring the neural circuitry. The evolutionarily conserved NDR1/2 kinase pathway, important for polarized growth from yeast to mammals, controls dendrite growth and morphology in the worm and fly. The function of NDR1/2 in mammalian neurons and their downstream effectors were not known. Here we show that the expression of dominant negative (kinase-dead) NDR1/2 mutants or siRNA increase dendrite length and proximal branching of mammalian pyramidal neurons in cultures and in vivo, whereas the expression of constitutively active NDR1/2 has the opposite effect. Moreover, NDR1/2 contributes to dendritic spine development and excitatory synaptic function. We further employed chemical genetics and identified NDR1/2 substrates in the brain, including two proteins involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking: AAK1 (AP-2 associated kinase) and Rabin8, a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) of Rab8 GTPase. We finally show that AAK1 contributes to dendrite growth regulation, and Rabin8 regulates spine development."
https://openalex.org/W1989602986,"Interneurons are critical for neuronal circuit function, but how their dendritic morphologies and membrane properties influence information flow within neuronal circuits is largely unknown. We studied the spatiotemporal profile of synaptic integration and short-term plasticity in dendrites of mature cerebellar stellate cells by combining two-photon guided electrical stimulation, glutamate uncaging, electron microscopy, and modeling. Synaptic activation within thin (0.4 μm) dendrites produced somatic responses that became smaller and slower with increasing distance from the soma, sublinear subthreshold input-output relationships, and a somatodendritic gradient of short-term plasticity. Unlike most studies showing that neurons employ active dendritic mechanisms, we found that passive cable properties of thin dendrites determine the sublinear integration and plasticity gradient, which both result from large dendritic depolarizations that reduce synaptic driving force. These integrative properties allow stellate cells to act as spatiotemporal filters of synaptic input patterns, thereby biasing their output in favor of sparse presynaptic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2072540287,"This study sought to determine whether playing a ""serious"" interactive digital game (IDG)--the Re-Mission videogame for cancer patients--activates mesolimbic neural circuits associated with incentive motivation, and if so, whether such effects stem from the participatory aspects of interactive gameplay, or from the complex sensory/perceptual engagement generated by its dynamic event-stream. Healthy undergraduates were randomized to groups in which they were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) as they either actively played Re-Mission or as they passively observed a gameplay audio-visual stream generated by a yoked active group subject. Onset of interactive game play robustly activated mesolimbic projection regions including the caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens, as well as a subregion of the parahippocampal gyrus. During interactive gameplay, subjects showed extended activation of the thalamus, anterior insula, putamen, and motor-related regions, accompanied by decreased activation in parietal and medial prefrontal cortex. Offset of interactive gameplay activated the anterior insula and anterior cingulate. Between-group comparisons of within-subject contrasts confirmed that mesolimbic activation was significantly more pronounced in the active playgroup than in the passive exposure control group. Individual difference analyses also found the magnitude of parahippocampal activation following gameplay onset to correlate with positive attitudes toward chemotherapy assessed both at the end of the scanning session and at an unannounced one-month follow-up. These findings suggest that IDG-induced activation of reward-related mesolimbic neural circuits stems primarily from participatory engagement in gameplay (interactivity), rather than from the effects of vivid and dynamic sensory stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2155309830,"Background Nucleosome translocation along DNA is catalyzed by eukaryotic SNF2-type ATPases. One class of SNF2-ATPases is distinguished by the presence of a C-terminal bromodomain and is conserved from yeast to man and plants. This class of SNF2 enzymes forms rather large protein complexes that are collectively called SWI/SNF complexes. They are involved in transcription and DNA repair. Two broad types of SWI/SNF complexes have been reported in the literature; PBAF and BAF. These are distinguished by the inclusion or not of polybromo and several ARID subunits. Here we investigated human SS18, a protein that is conserved in plants and animals. SS18 is a putative SWI/SNF subunit which has been implicated in the etiology of synovial sarcomas by virtue of being a target for oncogenic chromosomal translocations that underlie synovial sarcomas. Methodology/Principal Findings We pursued a proteomic approach whereby the SS18 open reading frame was fused to a tandem affinity purification tag and expressed in amenable human cells. The fusion permitted efficient and exclusive purification of so-called BAF-type SWI/SNF complexes which bear ARID1A/BAF250a or ARID1B/BAF250b subunits. This demonstrates that SS18 is a BAF subtype-specific SWI/SNF complex subunit. The same result was obtained when using the SS18-SSX1 oncogenic translocation product. Furthermore, SS18L1, DPF1, DPF2, DPF3, BRD9, BCL7A, BCL7B and BCL7C were identified. ‘Complex walking’ showed that they all co-purify with each other, defining human BAF-type complexes. By contrast,we demonstrate that human PHF10 is part of the PBAF complex, which harbors both ARID2/BAF200 and polybromo/BAF180 subunits, but not SS18 and nor the above BAF-specific subunits. Conclusions/Significance SWI/SNF complexes are found in most eukaryotes and in the course of evolution new SWI/SNF subunits appeared. SS18 is found in plants as well as animals. Our results suggest that in both protostome and deuterostome animals, a class of BAF-type SWI/SNF complexes will be found that harbor SS18 or its paralogs, along with ARID1, DPF and BCL7 paralogs. Those BAF complexes are proteomically distinct from the eukaryote-wide PBAF-type SWI/SNF complexes. Finally, our results suggests that the human bromodomain factors BRD7 and BRD9 associate with PBAF and BAF, respectively."

In the current study, we explore the relationship between TINs and clinicopathological features of gastric adenocarcinoma patients. Furthermore, we investigated the prognostic value of TINs. Patients and Methods The study was comprised of two groups, training group (115 patients) and test group (97 patients). Biomarkers (intratumoral CD15+ neutrophils) were assessed by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between clinicopathological features and patient outcome were evaluated using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results Immunohistochemical detection showed that the tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (TINs) in the training group ranged from 0.00–115.70 cells/high-power microscopic field (HPF) and the median number was 21.60 cells/HPF. Based on the median number, the patients were divided into high and low TINs groups. Chi-square test analysis revealed that the density of CD15+ TINs was positively associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.024), distance metastasis (p = 0.004) and UICC (International Union Against Cancer) staging (p = 0.028). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with a lower density of TINs had a better prognosis than patients with a higher density of TINs (p = 0.002). Multivariate Cox's analysis showed that the density of CD15+ TINs was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of gastric adenocarcinoma patients. Using another 97 patients as a test group and basing on the median number of TINs (21.60 cells/HPF) coming from the training group, Kaplan-Meier analysis also showed that patients with a lower density of TINs had a better prognosis than patients with a higher density of TINs (p = 0.032). The results verify that the number of CD15+ TINs can predict the survival of gastric adenocarcinoma surgical patients. Conclusions The presence of CD15+ TINs is an independent and unfavorable factor in the prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma patients. Targeting CD15+ TINs may be a potential intervenient therapy in the future."

Here we show that TSPAN7 overexpression promotes the formation of filopodia and dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons from embryonic rats, whereas TSPAN7 silencing reduces head size and stability of spines and AMPA receptor currents. Via its C terminus, TSPAN7 interacts with the PDZ domain of protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1), to regulate PICK1 and GluR2/3 association and AMPA receptor trafficking. These findings indicate that, in hippocampal neurons, TSPAN7 regulates AMPA receptor trafficking by limiting PICK1 accessibility to AMPA receptors and suggest an additional mechanism for the functional maturation of glutamatergic synapses, whose impairment is implicated in intellectual disability."
https://openalex.org/W2087952993,"European foulbrood (EFB) is an important infectious disease of honeybee larvae, but its pathogenic mechanisms are still poorly understood. The causative agent, Melissococcus plutonius, is a fastidious organism, and microaerophilic to anaerobic conditions and the addition of potassium phosphate to culture media are required for growth. Although M. plutonius is believed to be remarkably homologous, in addition to M. plutonius isolates with typical cultural characteristics, M. plutonius-like organisms, with characteristics seemingly different from those of typical M. plutonius, have often been isolated from diseased larvae with clinical signs of EFB in Japan. Cultural and biochemical characterization of 14 M. plutonius and 19 M. plutonius-like strain/isolates revealed that, unlike typical M. plutonius strain/isolates, M. plutonius-like isolates were not fastidious, and the addition of potassium phosphate was not required for normal growth. Moreover, only M. plutonius-like isolates, but not typical M. plutonius strain/isolates, grew anaerobically on sodium phosphate-supplemented medium and aerobically on some potassium salt-supplemented media, were positive for β-glucosidase activity, hydrolyzed esculin, and produced acid from L-arabinose, D-cellobiose, and salicin. Despite the phenotypic differences, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization demonstrated that M. plutonius-like organisms were taxonomically identical to M. plutonius. However, by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis, these typical and atypical (M. plutonius-like) isolates were separately grouped into two genetically distinct clusters. Although M. plutonius is known to lose virulence quickly when cultured artificially, experimental infection of representative isolates showed that atypical M. plutonius maintained the ability to cause EFB in honeybee larvae even after cultured in vitro in laboratory media. Because the rapid decrease of virulence in cultured M. plutonius was a major impediment to elucidation of the pathogenesis of EFB, atypical M. plutonius discovered in this study will be a breakthrough in EFB research."

https://openalex.org/W1984526976,"Background Soybean red crown rot is a major soil-borne disease all over the world, which severely affects soybean production. Efficient and sustainable methods are strongly desired to control the soil-borne diseases. Principal Findings We firstly investigated the disease incidence and index of soybean red crown rot under different phosphorus (P) additions in field and found that the natural inoculation of rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) could affect soybean red crown rot, particularly without P addition. Further studies in sand culture experiments showed that inoculation with rhizobia or AMF significantly decreased severity and incidence of soybean red crown rot, especially for co-inoculation with rhizobia and AMF at low P. The root colony forming unit (CFU) decreased over 50% when inoculated by rhizobia and/or AMF at low P. However, P addition only enhanced CFU when inoculated with AMF. Furthermore, root exudates of soybean inoculated with rhizobia and/or AMF significantly inhibited pathogen growth and reproduction. Quantitative RT-PCR results indicated that the transcripts of the most tested pathogen defense-related (PR) genes in roots were significantly increased by rhizobium and/or AMF inoculation. Among them, PR2, PR3, PR4 and PR10 reached the highest level with co-inoculation of rhizobium and AMF. Conclusions Our results indicated that inoculation with rhizobia and AMF could directly inhibit pathogen growth and reproduction, and activate the plant overall defense system through increasing PR gene expressions. Combined with optimal P fertilization, inoculation with rhizobia and AMF could be considered as an efficient method to control soybean red crown rot in acid soils."
https://openalex.org/W2024921351,"G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) play key role in homologous desensitization of GPCRs. GRKs phosphorylate activated receptors, promoting high affinity binding of arrestins, which precludes G protein coupling. Direct binding to active GPCRs activates GRKs, so that they selectively phosphorylate only the activated form of the receptor regardless of the accessibility of the substrate peptides within it and their Ser/Thr-containing sequence. Mammalian GRKs were classified into three main lineages, but earlier GRK evolution has not been studied. Here we show that GRKs emerged at the early stages of eukaryotic evolution via an insertion of a kinase similar to ribosomal protein S6 kinase into a loop in RGS domain. GRKs in Metazoa fall into two clades, one including GRK2 and GRK3, and the other consisting of all remaining GRKs, split into GRK1-GRK7 lineage and GRK4-GRK5-GRK6 lineage in vertebrates. One representative of each of the two ancient clades is found as early as placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens. Several protists, two oomycetes and unicellular brown algae have one GRK-like protein, suggesting that the insertion of a kinase domain into the RGS domain preceded the origin of Metazoa. The two GRK families acquired distinct structural units in the N- and C-termini responsible for membrane recruitment and receptor association. Thus, GRKs apparently emerged before animals and rapidly expanded in true Metazoa, most likely due to the need for rapid signalling adjustments in fast-moving animals."
https://openalex.org/W1975215899,"Synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis are usually driven by neuronal activity but can also occur spontaneously. The identity and differences between vesicles supporting evoked and spontaneous neurotransmission remain highly debated. Here we combined nanometer-resolution imaging with a transient motion analysis approach to examine the dynamics of individual synaptic vesicles in hippocampal terminals under physiological conditions. We found that vesicles undergoing spontaneous and stimulated endocytosis differ in their dynamic behavior, particularly in the ability to engage in directed motion. Our data indicate that such motional differences depend on the myosin family of motor proteins, particularly myosin II. Analysis of synaptic transmission in the presence of myosin II inhibitor confirmed a specific role for myosin II in evoked, but not spontaneous, neurotransmission and also suggested a functional role of myosin II-mediated vesicle motion in supporting vesicle mobilization during neural activity."
https://openalex.org/W2032108567,"As the primary sites of synaptic or sensory input in the nervous system, dendrites play an essential role in processing neuronal and sensory information. Moreover, the specification of class specific dendrite arborization is critically important in establishing neural connectivity and the formation of functional networks. Cytoskeletal modulation provides a key mechanism for establishing, as well as reorganizing, dendritic morphology among distinct neuronal subtypes. While previous studies have established differential roles for the small GTPases Rac and Rho in mediating dendrite morphogenesis, little is known regarding the direct regulators of these genes in mediating distinct dendritic architectures.Here we demonstrate that the RhoGEF Trio is required for the specification of class specific dendritic morphology in dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons of the Drosophila peripheral nervous system (PNS). Trio is expressed in all da neuron subclasses and loss-of-function analyses indicate that Trio functions cell-autonomously in promoting dendritic branching, field coverage, and refining dendritic outgrowth in various da neuron subtypes. Moreover, overexpression studies demonstrate that Trio acts to promote higher order dendritic branching, including the formation of dendritic filopodia, through Trio GEF1-dependent interactions with Rac1, whereas Trio GEF-2-dependent interactions with Rho1 serve to restrict dendritic extension and higher order branching in da neurons. Finally, we show that de novo dendritic branching, induced by the homeodomain transcription factor Cut, requires Trio activity suggesting these molecules may act in a pathway to mediate dendrite morphogenesis.Collectively, our analyses implicate Trio as an important regulator of class specific da neuron dendrite morphogenesis via interactions with Rac1 and Rho1 and indicate that Trio is required as downstream effector in Cut-mediated regulation of dendrite branching and filopodia formation."

In addition, female hormones, which are important in the pathogenesis and management of endometriosis, have been reported to precipitate migraine attacks and may confound the results. The aim of this population-based cohort study was to explore the relationship between migraine and endometriosis in women of reproductive age (18-51 years). Data were derived from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, which contains outpatient and inpatient records from 2000 to 2007. Our study cohort included 20,220 endometriosis patients and 263,767 controls without endometriosis. We analyzed the prevalence of migraine in these women as recorded during the eight years of the database. Our results found that patients with endometriosis were more likely to suffer migraine headaches compared to controls (odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.59, 1.82]; p<0.001). In addition, the co-morbid association between migraine and endometriosis remained significant after the data were controlled for age and frequently utilized hormone therapies (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, [1.27, 1.47]; p<0.001). The results of this cohort study support the existence of a co-morbid relationship between migraine and endometriosis, even after adjusting for the possible effects of female hormone therapies on migraine attacks."
https://openalex.org/W2089266967,"Immunotherapies that induce durable immune control of chronic HIV infection may eliminate the need for life-long dependence on drugs. We investigated a DNA vaccine formulated with a novel genetic adjuvant that stimulates immune responses in the blood and gut for the ability to improve therapy in rhesus macaques chronically infected with SIV. Using the SIV-macaque model for AIDS, we show that epidermal co-delivery of plasmids expressing SIV Gag, RT, Nef and Env, and the mucosal adjuvant, heat-labile E. coli enterotoxin (LT), during antiretroviral therapy (ART) induced a substantial 2–4-log fold reduction in mean virus burden in both the gut and blood when compared to unvaccinated controls and provided durable protection from viral rebound and disease progression after the drug was discontinued. This effect was associated with significant increases in IFN-γ T cell responses in both the blood and gut and SIV-specific CD8+ T cells with dual TNF-α and cytolytic effector functions in the blood. Importantly, a broader specificity in the T cell response seen in the gut, but not the blood, significantly correlated with a reduction in virus production in mucosal tissues and a lower virus burden in plasma. We conclude that immunizing with vaccines that induce immune responses in mucosal gut tissue could reduce residual viral reservoirs during drug therapy and improve long-term treatment of HIV infection in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1995443765,"In endotherms insects, the thermoregulatory mechanisms modulate heat transfer from the thorax to the abdomen to avoid overheating or cooling in order to obtain a prolonged flight performance. Scarabaeus sacer and S. cicatricosus, two sympatric species with the same habitat and food preferences, showed daily temporal segregation with S. cicatricosus being more active during warmer hours of the day in opposition to S. sacer who avoid it. In the case of S. sacer, their endothermy pattern suggested an adaptive capacity for thorax heat retention. In S. cicatricosus, an active ‘heat exchanger’ mechanism was suggested. However, no empirical evidence had been documented until now. Thermographic sequences recorded during flight performance showed evidence of the existence of both thermoregulatory mechanisms. In S. sacer, infrared sequences showed a possible heat insulator (passive thermal window), which prevents heat transfer from meso- and metathorax to the abdomen during flight. In S. cicatricosus, infrared sequences revealed clear and effective heat flow between the thorax and abdomen (abdominal heat transfer) that should be considered the main mechanism of thermoregulation. This was related to a subsequent increase in abdominal pumping (as a cooling mechanism) during flight. Computer microtomography scanning, anatomical dissections and internal air volume measurements showed two possible heat retention mechanisms for S. sacer; the abdominal air sacs and the development of the internal abdominal sternites that could explain the thermoregulation between thorax and abdomen. Our results suggest that interspecific interactions between sympatric species are regulated by very different mechanisms. These mechanisms create unique thermal niches for the different species, thereby preventing competition and modulating spatio-temporal distribution and the composition of dung beetle assemblages."
https://openalex.org/W2017406716,"Background Motility is an important component of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST) pathogenesis allowing the bacteria to move into appropriate niches, across the mucus layer and invade the intestinal epithelium. In vitro, flagellum-associated motility is closely related to the invasive properties of ST. The probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii BIOCODEX (S.b-B) is widely prescribed for the prophylaxis and treatment of diarrheal diseases caused by bacteria or antibiotics. In case of Salmonella infection, S.b-B has been shown to decrease ST invasion of T84 colon cell line. The present study was designed to investigate the impact of S.b-B on ST motility. Methodology/Principal Findings Experiments were performed on human colonic T84 cells infected by the Salmonella strain 1344 alone or in the presence of S.b-B. The motility of Salmonella was recorded by time-lapse video microscopy. Next, a manual tracking was performed to analyze bacteria dynamics (MTrackJ plugin, NIH image J software). This revealed that the speed of bacterial movement was modified in the presence of S.b-B. The median curvilinear velocity (CLV) of Salmonella incubated alone with T84 decreased from 43.3 µm/sec to 31.2 µm/sec in the presence of S.b-B. Measurement of track linearity (TL) showed similar trends: S.b-B decreased by 15% the number of bacteria with linear tract (LT) and increased by 22% the number of bacteria with rotator tract (RT). Correlation between ST motility and invasion was further established by studying a non-motile flagella-deficient ST strain. Indeed this strain that moved with a CLV of 0.5 µm/sec, presented a majority of RT and a significant decrease in invasion properties. Importantly, we show that S.b-B modified the motility of the pathogenic strain SL1344 and significantly decreased invasion of T84 cells by this strain. Conclusions This study reveals that S.b-B modifies Salmonella's motility and trajectory which may account for the modification of Salmonella's invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2047279542,"Our previous finding that the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and the Na,K-ATPase interact as a regulatory complex to modulate Na,K-ATPase activity suggested that chronic, circulating nicotine may alter this interaction, with long-term changes in the membrane potential. To test this hypothesis, we chronically exposed rats to nicotine delivered orally for 21-31 days. Chronic nicotine produced a steady membrane depolarization of ∼3 mV in the diaphragm muscle, which resulted from a net change in electrogenic transport by the Na,K-ATPase α2 and α1 isoforms. Electrogenic transport by the α2 isoform increased (+1.8 mV) while the activity of the α1 isoform decreased (-4.4 mV). Protein expression of Na,K-ATPase α1 or α2 isoforms and the nAChR did not change; however, the content of α2 subunit in the plasma membrane decreased by 25%, indicating that its stimulated electrogenic transport is due to an increase in specific activity. The physical association between the nAChR, the Na,K-ATPase α1 or α2 subunits, and the regulatory subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, phospholemman (PLM), measured by co-immuno precipitation, was stable and unchanged. Chronic nicotine treatment activated PKCα/β2 and PKCδ and was accompanied by parallel increases in PLM phosphorylation at Ser(63) and Ser(68). Collectively, these results demonstrate that nicotine at chronic doses, acting through the nAChR-Na,K-ATPase complex, is able to modulate Na,K-ATPase activity in an isoform-specific manner and that the regulatory range includes both stimulation and inhibition of enzyme activity. Cholinergic modulation of Na,K-ATPase activity is achieved, in part, through activation of PKC and phosphorylation of PLM."
https://openalex.org/W1988436988,"Conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT) is closely associated with ocular surface immunity. This study investigated the effects of antiglaucoma prostaglandin analogs with or without benzalkonium chloride (BAK) preservative on organized CALT using an acute toxic model. A total of 48 albino rabbits were used and seven groups of treatments were constituted. Solutions (50 µl) of PBS, 0.02%BAK, 0.02%BAK+latanoprost, 0.015%BAK+travoprost, 0.005%BAK+bimatoprost, BAK-freetravoprost preserved with the SofZia® system or BAK-freetafluprost were instilled 15 times at 5-min intervals in both eyes. CALT changes were analyzed using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), immunohistology in cryosections for detecting MUC-5AC+ mucocytes and CD45+ hematopoietic cells. Antiglaucoma eye drops stimulated inflammatory cell infiltration in the CALT, and seemed to be primarily related to the concentration of their BAK content. The CALT reaction after instillation of BAK-containing eye drops was characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration in the dome and intrafollicular layers and by cell circulation inside the lymph vessels. CD45 was strongly expressed in the CALT after instillation of all BAK-containing solutions at 4 h and decreased at 24 h. The number of MUC-5AC+ mucocytes around the CALT structure decreased dramatically after instillation of BAK-containing solutions. This study showed for the first time the in vivo aspect of rabbit CALT after toxic stimuli, confirming the concentration-dependent toxic effects of BAK. IVCM-CALT analysis could be a pertinent tool in the future for understanding the immunotoxicologic challenges in the ocular surface and would provide useful criteria for evaluating newly developed eye drops."
https://openalex.org/W2069972167,"To assess the impact of socioeconomic variables on lymphatic filariasis in endemic villages of Karimnagar district, Andhra Pradesh, India.A pilot scale study was conducted in 30 villages of Karimnagar district from 2004 to 2007. These villages were selected based on previous reports from department of health, Government of Andhra Pradesh, epidemiology, entomology and socioeconomic survey was conducted as per protocol. Collected data were analysed statistically by Chi square test, Principal Component Analysis, Odds ratio, Bivariate, multivariate logistic regression analysis.Total of 5,394 blood samples collected and screened for microfilaria, out of which 199 were found to be positive (3.7%). The socioeconomic data of these respondents/participants were correlated with MF prevalence. The socioeconomic variables like educational status (Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.6, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.1-6.5), house structure (hut OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2-3.1; tiled OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 0.8-2) and participation in mass drug administration program (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.3-2.6) were found to be highly associated with the occurrence of filarial disease. The socioeconomic index was categorized into low (3.6%; OR-1.1, 95% CI: 0.7-1.5) medium (4.9%; OR-1.5, 95% CI = 1-2.1) and high (3.3%) in relation to percentage of filarial parasite prevalence. A significant difference was observed among these three groups while comparing the number of cases of filaria with the type of socioeconomic conditions of the respondents (P = 0.067).From this study it is inferred that age, education of family, type of house structure and awareness about the filarial disease directly influenced the disease prevalence. Beside annual mass drug administration program, such type of analysis should be undertaken by health officials to target a few socioeconomic factors to reduce the disease burden. Health education campaigns in the endemic villages and imparting of protection measures against mosquitoes using insecticide treated bed nets would substantially reduce the disease in these villages."
https://openalex.org/W2161179961,"Background Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), employed for treatment of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is based on over-expression of Somatostatin Receptors (SSTRs) on NETs. It is, however, limited by high uptake and retention of radiolabeled peptide in kidneys resulting in unnecessary radiation exposure thus causing nephrotoxicity. Employing a nanocarrier to deliver PRRT drugs specifically to the tumor can reduce the associated nephrotoxicity. Based on this, 177Lu-DOTATATE loaded PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) were formulated in the present study, as a potential therapeutic model for NETs. Methodology and Findings DOTATATE was labeled with Lutetium-177 (177Lu) (labeling efficiency 98%; Rf∼0.8). Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) coated 177Lu-DOTATATE-PLGA NPs (50∶50 and 75∶25) formulated, were spherical with mean size of 304.5±80.8 and 733.4±101.3 nm (uncoated) and 303.8±67.2 and 494.3±71.8 nm (coated) for PLGA(50∶50) and PLGA(75∶25) respectively. Encapsulation efficiency (EE) and In-vitro release kinetics for uncoated and coated NPs of PLGA (50∶50 & 75∶25) were assessed and compared. Mean EE was 77.375±4.98% & 67.885±5.12% (uncoated) and 65.385±5.67% & 58.495±5.35% (coated). NPs showed initial burst release between 16.64–21.65% with total 42.83–44.79% over 21days. The release increased with coating to 20.4–23.95% initially and 60.97–69.12% over 21days. In-vivo studies were done in rats injected with 177Lu-DOTATATE and 177Lu-DOTATATE-NP (uncoated and PEG-coated) by imaging and organ counting after sacrificing rats at different time points over 24 hr post-injection. With 177Lu-DOTATATE, renal uptake of 37.89±10.2%ID/g was observed, which reduced to 4.6±1.97% and 5.27±1.66%ID/g with uncoated and coated 177Lu-DOTATATE-NP. The high liver uptake with uncoated 177Lu-DOTATATE-NP (13.68±3.08% ID/g), reduced to 7.20±2.04%ID/g (p = 0.02) with PEG coating. Conclusion PLGA NPs were easily formulated and modified for desired release properties. PLGA 50∶50 NPs were a more suitable delivery vehicle for 177Lu-DOTATATE than PLGA 75∶25 because of higher EE and slower release rate. Reduced renal retention of 177Lu-DOTATATE and reduced opsonisation strongly advocate the potential of 177Lu-DOTATATE-PLGA-PEG NPs to reduce radiation dose in PRRT."
https://openalex.org/W2034822692,"Objectives While prejudice has often been shown to be rooted in experiences of threat, the biological underpinnings of this threat–prejudice association have received less research attention. The present experiment aims to test whether activations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, due to anticipated interactions with out-group members, predict self-reported prejudice. Moreover, we explore potential moderators of this relationship (i.e., interpersonal similarity; subtle vs. blatant prejudice). Methodology/Principal findings Participants anticipated an interaction with an out-group member who was similar or dissimilar to the self. To index HPA activation, cortisol responses to this event were measured. Then, subtle and blatant prejudices were measured via questionnaires. Findings indicated that only when people anticipated an interaction with an out-group member who was dissimilar to the self, their cortisol response to this event significantly predicted subtle (r = .50) and blatant (r = .53) prejudice. Conclusions These findings indicate that prejudicial attitudes are linked to HPA-axis activity. Furthermore, when intergroup interactions are interpreted to be about individuals (and not so much about groups), experienced threat (or its biological substrate) is less likely to relate to prejudice. This conclusion is discussed in terms of recent insights from social neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W1973770299,"Spatially and temporally controlled gene expression, including transcription, several mRNA processing steps, and the export of mature mRNA to the cytoplasm, is essential for developmental processes. It is well known that RNA helicases of the DExD/H-box protein family are involved in these gene expression processes, including transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, and rRNA biogenesis. Although one DExD/H-box protein, Prp5, a homologue of vertebrate Ddx46, has been shown to play important roles in pre-mRNA splicing in yeast, the in vivo function of Ddx46 remains to be fully elucidated in metazoans. In this study, we isolated zebrafish morendo (mor), a mutant that shows developmental defects in the digestive organs and brain, and found that it encodes Ddx46. The Ddx46 transcript is maternally supplied, and as development proceeds in zebrafish larvae, its ubiquitous expression gradually becomes restricted to those organs. The results of whole-mount in situ hybridization showed that the expression of various molecular markers in these organs is considerably reduced in the Ddx46 mutant. Furthermore, splicing status analysis with RT-PCR revealed unspliced forms of mRNAs in the digestive organ and brain tissues of the Ddx46 mutant, suggesting that Ddx46 may be required for pre-mRNA splicing during zebrafish development. Therefore, our results suggest a model in which zebrafish Ddx46 is required for the development of the digestive organs and brain, possibly through the control of pre-mRNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2028327681,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) with a presumed autoimmune etiology. Approved treatments for MS are immunoregulatory and are able to reduce the inflammatory components of the disease. However, these treatments do not suppress progressive clinical disability. Approaches that directly protect myelin-producing oligodendrocytes and enhance remyelination are likely to improve long-term outcomes and reduce the rate of axonal damage. Galanin (GAL) is a bioactive neuropeptide that is widely distributed throughout the nervous system and has diverse neuromodulatory effects. In this study, using the cuprizone (CPZ) demyelination model of MS, we demonstrate that GAL has pronounced neuroprotective effects with respect to demyelination and remyelination. Using our GAL transgenic mouse (GAL-Tg), we identified a novel attenuation of OLs against CPZ induced demyelination, which was exerted independently of progenitor cells. Alleviation of myelin breakdown in the GAL-Tg mice was observed to be significant. Furthermore, we observed changes in the expression of the GAL receptor GalR1 during the demyelination and remyelination processes. Our data strongly indicate that GAL has the capacity to influence the outcome of primary insults that directly target OLs, as opposed to cases where immune activation is the primary pathogenic event. Taken together, these results suggest that GAL is a promising next-generation target for the treatment of MS."

Bone marrow-derived fibrocytes have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of other interstitial lung diseases. The goal of this study was to define the contribution of fibrocytes to the pathogenesis of sickle cell lung disease.Fibrocytes were quantified and characterized in subjects with sickle cell disease or healthy controls, and in a model of sickle cell disease, the NY1DD mouse. The role of the chemokine ligand CXCL12 in trafficking of fibrocytes and phenotype of lung disease was examined in the animal model. We found elevated concentration of activated fibrocytes in the peripheral blood of subjects with sickle cell disease, which increased further during vaso-occlusive crises. There was a similar elevations in the numbers and activation phenotype of fibrocytes in the bone marrow, blood, and lungs of the NY1DD mouse, both at baseline and under conditions of hypoxia/re-oxygenation. In both subjects with sickle cell disease and the mouse model, fibrocytes expressed a hierarchy of chemokine receptors, with CXCR4 expressed on most fibrocytes, and CCR2 and CCR7 expressed on a smaller subset of cells. Depletion of the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, in the mouse model resulted in a marked reduction of fibrocyte trafficking into the lungs, reduced lung collagen content and improved lung compliance and histology.These data support the notion that activated fibrocytes play a significant role in the pathogenesis of sickle cell lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W2170693988,"Background FAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase), primarily expressed in the liver, hydrolyzes the endocannabinoids fatty acid ethanolamides (FAA). Human FAAH gene mutations are associated with increased body weight and obesity. In our present study, using targeted metabolite and lipid profiling, and new global acetylome profiling methodologies, we examined the role of the liver on fuel and energy homeostasis in whole body FAAH−/− mice. Methodology/Principal Findings FAAH−/− mice exhibit altered energy homeostasis demonstrated by decreased oxygen consumption (Indirect calorimetry). FAAH−/− mice are hyperinsulinemic and have adipose, skeletal and hepatic insulin resistance as indicated by stable isotope phenotyping (SIPHEN). Fed state skeletal muscle and liver triglyceride levels was increased 2–3 fold, while glycogen was decreased 42% and 57% respectively. Hepatic cholesterol synthesis was decreased 22% in FAAH−/− mice. Dysregulated hepatic FAAH−/− lysine acetylation was consistent with their metabolite profiling. Fasted to fed increases in hepatic FAAH−/− acetyl-CoA (85%, p<0.01) corresponded to similar increases in citrate levels (45%). Altered FAAH−/− mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH2) acetylation, which can affect the malate aspartate shuttle, was consistent with our observation of a 25% decrease in fed malate and aspartate levels. Decreased fasted but not fed dihydroxyacetone-P and glycerol-3-P levels in FAAH−/− mice was consistent with a compensating contribution from decreased acetylation of fed FAAH−/− aldolase B. Fed FAAH−/− alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) acetylation was also decreased. Conclusions/Significance Whole body FAAH deletion contributes to a pre-diabetic phenotype by mechanisms resulting in impairment of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. FAAH−/− mice had altered hepatic lysine acetylation, the pattern sharing similarities with acetylation changes reported with chronic alcohol treatment. Dysregulated hepatic lysine acetylation seen with impaired FAA hydrolysis could support the liver's role in fostering the pre-diabetic state, and may reflect part of the mechanism underlying the hepatic effects of endocannabinoids in alcoholic liver disease mouse models."
https://openalex.org/W2077076064,"Economic costs associated with the invasion of nonnative species are of global concern. We estimated expected costs of Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera (L.) Small) invasions related to timber production in southern U.S. forestlands under different management strategies. Expected costs were confined to the value of timber production losses plus costs for search and control. We simulated management strategies including (1) no control (NC), and control beginning as soon as the percentage of invaded forest land exceeded (2) 60 (Low Control), (3) 25 (Medium Control), or (4) 0 (High Control) using a spatially-explicit, stochastic, bioeconomic model. With NC, simulated invasions spread northward and westward into Arkansas and along the Gulf of Mexico to occupy ≈1.2 million hectares within 20 years, with associated expected total costs increasing exponentially to ≈$300 million. With LC, MC, and HC, invaded areas reached ≈275, 34, and 2 thousand hectares after 20 years, respectively, with associated expected costs reaching ≈$400, $230, and $200 million. Complete eradication would not be cost-effective; the minimum expected total cost was achieved when control began as soon as the percentage of invaded land exceeded 5%. These results suggest the importance of early detection and control of Chinese tallow, and emphasize the importance of integrating spread dynamics and economics to manage invasive species."
https://openalex.org/W2044046655,"Interactions between the early-life colonising intestinal microbiota and the developing immune system are critical in determining the nature of immune responses in later life. Studies in neonatal animals in which this interaction can be examined are central to understanding the mechanisms by which the microbiota impacts on immune development and to developing therapies based on manipulation of the microbiome. The inbred piglet model represents a system that is comparable to human neonates and allows for control of the impact of maternal factors. Here we show that colonisation with a defined microbiota produces expansion of mucosal plasma cells and of T-lymphocytes without altering the repertoire of alpha beta T-cells in the intestine. Importantly, this is preceded by microbially-induced expansion of a signal regulatory protein α-positive (SIRPα(+)) antigen-presenting cell subset, whilst SIRPα(-)CD11R1(+) antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are unaffected by colonisation. The central role of intestinal APCs in the induction and maintenance of mucosal immunity implicates SIRPα(+) antigen-presenting cells as orchestrators of early-life mucosal immune development."
https://openalex.org/W1977515598,"Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in women in sub-Saharan Africa. Extensive evidence has shown that cervical cancer and its precursor lesions are caused by Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Although the vast majority of HPV infections are naturally resolved, failure to eradicate infected cells has been shown to promote viral persistence and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, following neoplastic transformation, exposure of cervical epithelial cells to inflammatory mediators either directly or via the systemic circulation may enhance progression of the disease. It is well recognised that seminal plasma contains an abundance of inflammatory mediators, which are identified as regulators of tumour growth. Here we investigated the role of seminal plasma in regulating neoplastic cervical epithelial cell growth and tumorigenesis. Using HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells, we found that seminal plasma (SP) induced the expression of the inflammatory enzymes, prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PTGS1 and PTGS2), cytokines interleukin (IL) -6, and -11 and vascular endothelial growth factor-A(VEGF-A). To investigate the role of SP on tumour cell growth in vivo, we xenografted HeLa cells subcutaneously into the dorsal flank of nude mice. Intra-peritoneal administration of SP rapidly and significantly enhanced the tumour growth rate and size of HeLa cell xenografts in nude mice. As observed in vitro, we found that SP induced expression of inflammatory PTGS enzymes, cytokines and VEGF-A in vivo. Furthermore we found that SP enhances blood vessel size in HeLa cell xenografts. Finally we show that SP-induced cytokine production, VEGF-A expression and cell proliferation are mediated via the induction of the inflammatory PTGS pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1978531099,"Background Adult stem cells are critical for tissue homeostasis; therefore, the mechanisms utilized to maintain an adequate stem cell pool are important for the survival of an individual. In Drosophila, one mechanism utilized to replace lost germline stem cells (GSCs) is dedifferentiation of early progenitor cells. However, the average number of male GSCs decreases with age, suggesting that stem cell replacement may become compromised in older flies. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a temperature sensitive allelic combination of Stat92E to control dedifferentiation, we found that germline dedifferentiation is remarkably efficient in older males; somatic cells are also effectively replaced. Surprisingly, although the number of somatic cyst cells also declines with age, the proliferation rate of early somatic cells, including cyst stem cells (CySCs) increases. Conclusions These data indicate that defects in spermatogonial dedifferentiation are not likely to contribute significantly to an aging-related decline in GSCs. In addition, our findings highlight differences in the ways GSCs and CySCs age. Strategies to initiate or enhance the ability of endogenous, differentiating progenitor cells to replace lost stem cells could provide a powerful and novel strategy for maintaining tissue homeostasis and an alternative to tissue replacement therapy in older individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1983517657,"Replicative helicases unwind double-stranded DNA in front of the polymerase and ensure the processivity of DNA synthesis. In Escherichia coli, the helicase loader DnaC as well as factors involved in the formation of the open complex during the initiation of replication and primosomal proteins during the reactivation of arrested replication forks are required to recruit and deposit the replicative helicase onto single-stranded DNA prior to the formation of the replisome. dnaC2 is a thermosensitive allele of the gene specifying the helicase loader; at non-permissive temperature replication cannot initiate, but most ongoing rounds of replication continues through to completion (18% of dnaC2 cells fail to complete replication at non-permissive temperature). An assumption, which may be drawn from this observation, is that only a few replication forks are arrested under normal growth conditions. This assumption, however, is at odds with the severe and deleterious phenotypes associated with a null mutant of priA, the gene encoding a helicase implicated in the reactivation of arrested replication forks. We developed an assay that involves an abrupt inactivation of rounds of synchronized replication in a large population of cells, in order to evaluate the ability of dnaC2 cells to reactivate arrested replication forks at non-permissive temperature. We compared the rate at which arrested replication forks accumulated in dnaC2 priA+ and dnaC2 priA2 cells and observed that this rate was lower in dnaC2 priA+ cells. We conclude that while replication cannot initiate in a dnaC2 mutant at non-permissive temperature, a class of arrested replication forks (PriA-dependent and DnaC-independent) are reactivated within these cells."

The service was aimed at providing answers to clinical questions arising during the clinical encounter while the patient waits. Cost saving and cost avoidance were also analyzed. The data comes from eighty-eight primary care providers in the Ottawa area working in Family Health Networks (FHNs) and Family Health Groups (FHGs).We conducted a cost consequences analysis based on data from the JIT project. We also estimated the potential economic benefit of JIT librarian consultation service to the health care system.The results show that the cost per question for the JIT service was $38.20. The cost could be as low as $5.70 per question for a regular service. Nationally, if this service was implemented and if family physicians saw additional patients when the JIT service saved them time, up to 61,100 extra patients could be seen annually. A conservative estimate of the cost savings and cost avoidance per question for JIT was $11.55.The cost per question, if the librarian service was used at full capacity, is quite low. Financial savings to the health care system might exceed the cost of the service. Saving physician's time during their day could potentially lead to better access to family physicians by patients. Implementing a librarian consultation service can happen quickly as the time required to train professional librarians to do this service is short."
https://openalex.org/W2061135090,"Electrophysiological homeostasis is indispensable to vocal fold hydration. We investigate tight junction (TJ)-associated components, occludin and ZO-1, and permeability with or without the challenge of a permeability-augmenting agent, histamine. Freshly excised ovine larynges are obtained from a local abattoir. TJ markers are explored via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Paracellular permeabilities are measured in an Ussing system. The gene expression of both TJ markers is detected in native ovine vocal fold epithelium. Luminal histamine treatment significantly decreases transepithelial resistance (TER) (N = 72, p<0.01) and increases penetration of protein tracer (N = 35, p<0.001), respectively, in a time-, and dose-dependent fashion. The present study demonstrates that histamine compromises TJ-related paracellular barrier across vocal fold epithelium. The detection of TJ markers indicates the existence of typical TJ components in non-keratinized, stratified vocal fold epithelium. The responsiveness of paracellular permeabilities to histamine would highlight the functional significance of this TJ-equivalent system to the electrophysiological homeostasis, which, in turn, regulates the vocal fold superficial hydration."
https://openalex.org/W2080405782,"Background Necdin, a MAGE family protein expressed primarily in the nervous system, has been shown to interact with both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, but the mechanism of its nucleocytoplasmic transport are unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We carried out a large-scale interaction screen using necdin as a bait in the yeast RRS system, and found a wide range of potential interactors with different subcellular localizations, including over 60 new candidates for direct binding to necdin. Integration of these interactions into a comprehensive network revealed a number of coherent interaction modules, including a cytoplasmic module connecting to necdin through huntingtin-associated protein 1 (Hap1), dynactin and hip-1 protein interactor (Hippi); a nuclear P53 and Creb-binding-protein (Crebbp) module, connecting through Crebbp and WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (Wwtr1); and a nucleocytoplasmic transport module, connecting through transportins 1 and 2. We validated the necdin-transportin1 interaction and characterized a sequence motif in necdin that modulates karyopherin interaction. Surprisingly, a D234P necdin mutant showed enhanced binding to both transportin1 and importin β1. Finally, exclusion of necdin from the nucleus triggered extensive cell death. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that necdin has multiple roles within protein complexes in different subcellular compartments, and indicate that it can utilize multiple karyopherin-dependent pathways to modulate its localization."

We aimed to develop a screening platform for duct cell mitogens after depletion of the vimentin+ population. The CD90 cell surface marker was used to remove the vimentin+ cells from islet-depleted human pancreas cell cultures by magnetic-activated cell sorting. Cell sorting decreased CD90+ cell contamination of the cultures from 34±20% to 1.3±0.6%, yielding purified CK19+ cultures with epithelial morphology. A full-factorial experimental design was then applied to test the mitogenic effects of bFGF, EGF, HGF, KGF and VEGF. After 6 days in test conditions, the cells were labelled with BrdU, stained and analyzed by high-throughput imaging. This screening assay confirmed the expected mitogenic effects of bFGF, EGF, HGF and KGF on CK19+ cells and additionally revealed interactions between these factors and VEGF. A serum-free medium containing bFGF, EGF, HGF and KGF led to CK19+ cell expansion comparable to the addition of 10% serum. The methods developed in this work should advance pancreatic cancer and diabetes research by providing effective cell culture and high-throughput screening platforms to study purified primary pancreatic CK19+ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028118216,"A diverse assemblage of pollinators, such as bees, beetles, flies, and butterflies, will often visit a single plant species. However, evaluating the effect of several insects on fruit and seed production is difficult in plants visited by a variety of insects. Here, we analyzed the effect of three types of pollinators, Papilio spp., Macroglossum pyrrhosticta, and Xylocopa appendiculata on fruit and seed production in Clerodendrum trichotomum by using a flower visitor barrier experiment with nets of specific mesh sizes. As a result, fruit/flower and seed/ovule ratios were significantly lower under Papilio exclusion than under natural conditions. On the other hand, ratios were not significantly different between Papilio excluded and both Papilio and M. pyrrhosticta excluded treatments. Therefore, Papilio and X. appendiculata are effective pollinators, whereas M. pyrrhosticta, which was the most frequent visitor, of C. trichotomum, is not. From our observations of visiting behaviors, we believe that because M. pyrrhosticta probably promotes self- pollination, this species is a non-effective pollinator. This is the first study to separate and compare the contribution of various visitors to the reproductive success of a plant."

https://openalex.org/W2028910150,"Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has become one of the most important techniques applied in plant molecular cytogenetics. However, the application of this technique in cotton has lagged behind because of difficulties in chromosome preparation. The focus of this article was FISH performed not only on cotton pachytene chromosomes, but also on cotton extended DNA fibers. The cotton pollen mother cells (PMCs) instead of buds or anthers were directly digested in enzyme to completely breakdown the cell wall. Before the routine acetic acid treatment, PMCs were incubated in acetic acid and enzyme mixture to remove the cytoplasm and clear the background. The method of ice-cold Carnoy's solution spreading chromosome was adopted instead of nitrogen removed method to avoid chromosomes losing and fully stretch chromosome. With the above-improved steps, the high-quality well-differentiated pachytene chromosomes with clear background were obtained. FISH results demonstrated that a mature protocol of cotton pachytene chromosomes preparation was presented. Intact and no debris cotton nuclei were obtained by chopping from etiolation cotyledons instead of the conventional liquid nitrogen grinding method. After incubating the nuclei with nucleus lysis buffer on slide, the parallel and clear background DNA fibers were acquired along the slide. This method overcomes the twist, accumulation and fracture of DNA fibers compared with other methods. The entire process of DNA fibers preparation requires only 30 min, in contrast, it takes 3 h with routine nitrogen grinding method. The poisonous mercaptoethanol in nucleus lysis buffer is replaced by nonpoisonous dithiothreitol. PVP40 in nucleus isolation buffer is used to prevent oxidation. The probability of success in isolating nuclei for DNA fiber preparation is almost 100% tested with this method in cotton. So a rapid, safe, and efficient method for the preparation of cotton extended DNA fibers suitable for FISH was established."
https://openalex.org/W2046459355,"The shortening of the 3′-end poly(A) tail, also called deadenylation, is crucial to the regulation of mRNA processing, transportation, translation and degradation. The deadenylation process is achieved by deadenylases, which specifically catalyze the removal of the poly(A) tail at the 3′-end of eukaryotic mRNAs and release 5′-AMP as the product. To achieve their physiological functions, all deadenylases have numerous binding partners that may regulate their catalytic properties or recruit them into various protein complexes. To study the effects of various partners, it is important to develop new deadenylase assay that can be applied either in vivo or in vitro. In this research, we developed the deadenylase assay by the size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) method. The SEC analysis indicated that the poly(A) or oligo(A) substrate and the product AMP could be successfully separated and quantified. The enzymatic parameters of deadenylase could be obtained by quantifying the AMP generation. When using the commercial poly(A) as the substrate, a biphasic catalytic process was observed, which might correlate to the two distinct states of poly(A) in the commercial samples. Different lots of commercial poly(A) had dissimilar size distributions and were dissimilar in response to the degradation of deadenylase. The deadenylation pattern, processive or distributive, could also be investigated using the SEC assay by monitoring the status of the substrate and the generation kinetics of AMP and A2. The SEC assay was applicable to both simple samples using the purified enzyme and complex enzyme reaction conditions such as using protein mixtures or crude cell extracts as samples. The influence of solutes with absorption at 254 nm could be successfully eliminated by constructing the different SEC profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2021425052,"Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) promotes expression of thyroid hormones which are essential for metabolism, growth, and development. Second-line drugs to treat tuberculosis (TB) can cause hypothyroidism by suppressing thyroid hormone synthesis. Therefore, TSH levels are routinely measured in TB patients receiving second-line drugs, and thyroxin treatment is initiated where indicated. However, standard TSH tests are technically demanding for many low-resource settings where TB is prevalent; a simple and inexpensive test is urgently needed.As a proof of concept study TSH was measured in routinely collected sera at the University Medical Center Utrecht, Netherlands, using the TSH-CHECK-1 (VEDALAB, Alençon, France), a lateral-flow rapid immunochromatographic assay with a TSH cut-off value of 10 µIU/mL, the standard threshold for initiating treatment. These results were compared with TSH levels measured by a reference standard (UniCel DXi 800 imunoassay system, Beckman Coulter, USA). Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were then calculated.A total of 215 serum samples were evaluated: 107 with TSH values <10 µIU/mL and 108 with values ≥10 µIU/mL. TSH-CHECK-1 test sensitivity was found to be 100.0% (95% CI: 96.6-100.0) and specificity was 76.6% (95% CI: 67.5-84.3). Predictive values (PV) were modelled for different levels of prevalence. For a prevalence of 10% and 50%, the positive PV was 32.2% (95% CI: 25.0-39.7%) and 81.1% (95% CI: 75.0-85.5%), respectively; the negative PV was 100% (95% CI: 98.9-100%) and 100% (95% CI: 91.3-100%) respectively.The TSH-CHECK-1 rapid test was practical and simple to perform but difficult to interpret on weak positive results. All sera with TSH≥10 µIU/mL were correctly identified, but the test lacked sufficient specificity. Given its excellent negative PV in this evaluation, the test shows promise for ruling out hypothyroidism. However, so far it appears that samples testing positive with TSH-CHECK-1 would require confirmation using another method."
https://openalex.org/W1963996131,"Background In cardiac surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and unfractionated heparin have negative effects on blood platelet function. In acute normovolemic haemodilution autologous unfractionated heparinised blood is stored ex-vivo and retransfused at the end of the procedure to reduce (allogeneic) transfusion requirements. In this observational study we assessed whether platelet function is better preserved in ex vivo stored autologous blood compared to platelet function in the patient during CPB. Methodology/Principal Finding We measured platelet aggregation responses pre-CPB, 5 min after the start of CPB, at the end of CPB, and after unfractionated heparin reversal, using multiple electrode aggregometry (Multiplate®) with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) and ristocetin activated test cells. We compared blood samples taken from the patient with samples taken from 100 ml ex-vivo stored blood, which we took to mimick blood storage during normovolemic haemodilution. Platelet function declined both in ex-vivo stored blood as well as in blood taken from the patient. At the end of CPB there were no differences in platelet aggregation responses between samples from the ex vivo stored blood and the patient. Conclusion/Significance Ex vivo preservation of autologous blood in unfractionated heparin does not seem to be profitable to preserve platelet function."
