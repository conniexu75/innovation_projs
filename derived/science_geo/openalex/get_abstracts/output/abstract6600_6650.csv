https://openalex.org/W1973959619,"This article classifies the major approaches to the assessment of the process and outcomes of medical care. The apparent need to safeguard and enhance the quality of care has led to the institution of mechanisms that subject care to constant review so that deficiencies may be found and corrected. The article reviews the developments that led to the involvement of the federal government in this activity through its sponsorship of professional standards review organizations (PSRO's). The major features of the PSRO's are described and their possible effects discussed. It is too early to say how the PSRO's will fare, but should they fail to accomplish their objectives the pressure for more radical solutions will be difficult to resist."

These keratins are similar to those of stratum corneum of human epidermal callus in their insolubility in dilute aqueous buffers, their molecular weight range of 40,000 to 60,000, their immunolgical reactivity, and their ability to assemble into 80 A tonofilaments in vitro; but there are differences in the molecular weights of some of the proteins, the number of components, and their charge heterogeneity, related at least in part to phosphorylation. About 30% of all the proteins of living cultured keratinocytes consists of keratins, compared with over 85% of stratum corneum. All the keratins of human stratum corneum were found to be cross-linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds while most keratins of the living cells were not. As the cells mature in Methocel-stabilized suspension culture, their keratins become increasingly disulfide cross-linked. When uncross-linked tonofilaments of living keratinocytes are dissolved in 8 M urea and the filaments reconstituted in vitro their keratins become disulfide cross-linked under aerobic conditions and consequently insoluble in solutions of 8 M urea or sodium dodecyl sulfate. The results indicate that the uncross-linked state of the keratins in living cells is due to the reducing intracellular environment and not to a precursor state related to the primary structure of the proteins. The disulfide cross-links stabilizing the keratin filaments must be distinguished from the epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine cross-links stabilizing the cornified cell envelope."

These experiments thus demonstrate a direct interference of dopamine action by a peripheral hormone. Prolactin secretion by pituitary cells in primary culture could possibly serve as an easily accessible model of a system under dopaminergic control."

https://openalex.org/W1572379239,"Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by acetylating an active site portion of the enzyme, prostaglandin synthetase. In the current study, the site of acetylation has been demonstrated to be a seryl residue at the NH2 terminus of the enzyme. Purified [3H]acetyl enzyme was prepared from seminal vesicle homogenates treated with [acetyl-3H]aspirin. The [3H]acetate to protein bond was stable to hydroxylamine, indicating an N-acetyl linkage. The [3H]acetyl enzyme was fragmented sequentially with cyanogen bromide, trypsin, and pronase. The 3H material isolated from the pronase digest was identified as N-acetylserine. This finding indicates that the oxygenase portion of prostaglandin synthetase has an NH2-terminal serine which is involved in enzymatic activity and is susceptible to acetylation by aspirin."

https://openalex.org/W2031686611,"The development of the mouse erythroblast to a mature erythrocyte is accompanied by changes in the composition and properties of the plasma membranes of these cells. Using double fluorescence techniques, we have simultaneously determined the distribution of lectin receptors and spectrin on the membranes of these cells. The lateral mobility of the lectin receptors in the membranes decreases as differentiation proceeds, and this is accompanied by an increasing concentration of spectrin associated with the membranes. The most significant concentration of spectrin occurs, however, during the enucleation of the late erythroblast, where we observe a complete segregation of the spectrin to the incipient reticulocyte, as well as a previously observed enrichment of receptors for concanavalin A into the plasma membrane surrounding the extruding nucleus. On the basis of these and other observations, we explore the possible molecular mechanisms involved in erythroblast enucleation and the role of spectrin in the regulation of protein mobility in erythroid cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2006544100,"Muscle cell cultures from Drosophila melanogaster were obtained by plating dissociated gastrula stage embryo cells on protamine-treated culture dishes. They myogenic cells in these cultures fuse to form multinucleated pulsating cells by 15 hr after plating. An analysis of protein synthesis during myogenesis in these cultures, as measured by the incorporation of 35S-methionine and analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, showed profound changes in the pattern of protein synthesis. This analysis enabled us to identify three distinct classes of proteins. Class A proteins, the most abundant, are synthesized continuously throughout myogenesis, class B proteins are those proteins whose synthesis is initiated during myogenesis and continued throughout development; class C proteins are those synthesized at specific times during development. In addition, three forms of actin have been identified in these cultures. Actin I, which shows increased synthesis concomitant with the myogenic development in these cultures, is apparently a muscle-specific form of actin. Actin II, the predominant ""cytoplasmic"" form of actin in the nonmuscle Schneider cell line 2, is also the major form in the gastrula cultures before differentiation begins. Synthesis of this actin continues in the myogenic cultures. Actin III is a rapidly turning over form of actin which does not accumulate in either the Schneider cells or the myogenic cultures."

https://openalex.org/W1566192638,"The fatty acid synthetase from lactating rat mammary gland is shown to consist of two polyfunctional polypeptides of similar molecular weight (about 220,000); a 4'-phosphopantetheine residue is covalently bound to one, or both subunits. Limited trypsinization of the fatty acid synthetase releases on enzymatically active thioesterase component which has been purified and its properties studied. The thioesterase sediments in the ultracentrifuge as a single component of molecular weight 32,000; its sedimentation coefficient is 2.9 x 10-(13) s its diffusion coefficient 5.0 x 10-(7) cm2 s-(1). The thioesterase also elutes from a column of Sephadex G-75 as a single, symmetrical peak of constant specific activity. However, electrophoresis of the denatured thioesterase in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate reveals that the enzyme has been partially nicked during isolation. The kinetic data of the enzyme reaction were studied using palmityl-CoA as a model substrate. Solvent pH was found to affect both Vmax and Km (Km = 0.5 micron at pH 6.6, 2.5 micron at pH 8.0) wereas solvent ionic strength affected Vmax but no Km. The thioesterases from the fatty acid synthetases of rat liver and lactating mammary gland have identical physical properties, identical amino acid compositions, and are immunologically indistinguishable. Both thioesterases hydrolyze long chain, in preference to short chain, thioesters of CoA, an observation consistent with their role in regulation of the chain-terminating step in fatty acid synthesis by the parent multienzyme complexes."

These methods depend on the differential sensitivity of ""timer"" pathways to small changes in temperature and can be applied to any developmental sequence in which discrete stages can be reproducibly monitored with time. We have applied the methods to multicellular morphogenesis in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum and have obtained an unexpected tentative scheme for timer relationships. A minimum of six timers has been delineated, each specific for at least one morphological stage. The majority of these timers appear to be in parallel."
https://openalex.org/W2082243027,"Risk to human health was compared for five conventional and six nonconventional energy systems. The entire cycle for producing energy was considered, not just part. The most important conclusion drawn is that the risk to human health from nonconventional sources can be as high as, or even higher than, that of conventional sources. This result is produced only when the risk per unit energy is considered, rather than the risk per solar panel or windmill. The risk from nonconventional energy sources derives from the large amount of material and labor needed, along with their backup and storage requirements. Risk evaluation is a relatively new discipline, and therefore the results presented here can be considered only a beginning. However, society should keep relative risk in mind when evaluating present and future energy sources."
https://openalex.org/W2054878560,"A simple and sensitive radioimmunoassay using E. coli β-galactosidase as a model protein has been developed for the detection of specific translation products of foreign gene fragments cloned into plasmid or phage vectors. This immunoassay is based upon the coupling to an insoluble matrix of F(ab)′2 fragments derived from the specific antiserum by pepsin digestion. The in situ analysis of phage plaques or of bacterial colonies is performed by overlaying the phage plaques or lysed bacterial colonies with a cellulose filter to which F(ab)′2 fragments have been chemically coupled. The antigen bound to the filter is detected by subsequent incubations with undigested antiserum and with 125I-labeled Staphylococcus aureus protein A followed by autoradiography. By coupling the F(ab)′2 fragments to the wells of a plastic microtiter plate, liquid cultures can be analyzed quantitatively for the presence of antigen, making possible the analysis of heterogeneous cultures by sib selection. The detection threshold of the microtiter plate assay for liquid culture is shown to be <2 × 108 molecules, or about 1 molecule of β-galactosidase per cell. The in situ immunoassay for bacterial colonies, which permits examination of about 1000 clones per plate, can easily detect microcolonies producing about 10 molecules of β-galactosidase per cell, while the in situ phage plaque assay, also capable of screening about 1000 plaques per plate, is even more sensitive, detecting <1 × 107 molecules per bacteriophage plaque."

In contrast to the stability of these columns in more mature brain, monocular deprivation for 3 months from the first day of life results in their complete disappearance and a reversion of the autoradiographic pattern to that seen in animals with normal binocular vision. These results are consistent with a reorganization of the representation of the visual fields of the two eyes in the striate cortex and provide additional evidence of the plasticity of the striate cortex of the monkey in early life."
https://openalex.org/W1999633147,"Long-term care for the aged in the United States is overly dependent upon the nursing home. This hospital-like model for long-term care is particularly inappropriate since it imposes a medical solution on a variety of social problems. An adequate long-term care program requires a range of resources in the community as well as in institutions; sheltered housing options seem a desirable alternative to the nursing home. To ensure the quality of nursing home care, the present focus on setting standards for care activities should be abandoned in favor of a focus on care outcomes (physical, mental, and social). In an effort to change our present perverse incentives in the nursing home industry, the proposal is made that nursing homes be reimbursed according to the degree to which patient outcomes meet predicted outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W1999066229,"The steady state population of poly(A)+ mRNA from mouse L cells was fractionated into three size classes, <15S, 15S–24S and > 24S, and the nucleotide complexity of each class was determined by kinetic analysis of hybridization to a set of corresponding cDNA probes. A striking difference in complexity was found: the larger mRNA components comprise a diverse class of molecules in which most members were present at relatively low frequencies, while the smaller mRNAs comprise a class of lower complexity in which a greater proportion of the members were present at a relatively high frequency. A comparison of the sedimentation behavior of poly(A)+ mRNA from pulse-labeled cells and from long-term labeled and chased cells indicated that the more stable species of poly(A)+ mRNA were considerably smaller on average than the more rapidly turning over species. Moreover, when differentially labeled stable and unstable mRNAs were simultaneously hybridized with excess cDNA transcribed from steady state poly(A)+ mRNA, we observed that the stable species constitute a major portion of the low complexity class. Thus the correlations between relatively small size, high stability and abundance are all consistent in indicating that differential turnover of cytoplasmic mRNA contributes significantly to the determination of mRNA abundancy in mouse L cells. The results also have important implications for the quantitative analysis of hybridization kinetics of unfractionated mRNA preparations. A bias for large mRNA components in the high complexity class, coupled with the tendency of reverse transcriptase to terminate prematurely while copying large mRNAs, can result in significant distortions of the mRNA frequency distribution."

https://openalex.org/W2027270228,"Abstract The relationship of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs from early region 2 of the adenovirus 2 genome (map positions 61.6–75.0) has been determined. The 20S cytoplasmic mRNA which codes for the 72K DNA-binding protein has been shown to contain spliced sequences as previously reported (Berk and Sharp, 1977b; Kitchingman, Lai and Westphal, 1977). The nuclear poly(A)-containing RNA migrates as 28S, 23S and 20S molecules (Craig and Raskas, 1976). Structural analysis demonstrated that nuclear 23S and 20S RNAs lack intervening sequences (map positions 74.6–68.8) that are also absent from the cytoplasmic mRNA. In contrast, the nuclear 28S RNA has sequences complementary to the intervening DNA sequences. The analysis of colinear transcripts from the I strand of region 2 suggests that nuclear 28S and 23S RNAs contain the intervening sequences from a second splice (map positions 68.3–66.3). The nuclear 20S RNA, like the mature cytoplasmic mRNA, lacks these sequences. We also detected colinear polyadenylated transcripts from the r strand of region 2 that do not have any apparent relationship to early mRNA. In continuous label experiments, the 28S and 23S species reached a steady state within 30 min, whereas the amounts of nuclear and cytoplasmic 20S RNAs continued to increase for at least 3 hr. These studies suggest that the intervening DNA sequences of the 72K DNA binding protein gene are transcribed in its mRNA precursor (28S). These sequences are then removed sequentially to generate first a 23S intermediate and then a 20S nuclear RNA that will be transported to the cytoplasm as a mature mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1984144069,"In two cebus (Cebus albifrons) monkeys given weekly oral doses of 0.25 milligram of haloperidol per kilogram, movement disorders appeared 1 to 8 hours after drug administration following the tenth weekly dose. These disorders included oral movements, peculiar postures, writhing, and stretching. Such reactions faded in intensity after the next two doses. Increasing the dose to 0.5 milligram per kilogram has elicited the disorders reliably after each weekly dose for almost 2 years. Similar reactions also developed in a squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciurea) treated weekly with haloperidol and in a third cebus monkey previously maintained for a year on a regimen of 0.25 milligram of haloperidol per kilogram on 5 days per week. These findings suggest an experimental model for determining the etiology of drug-induced movement disorders. They also suggest an unrecognized clinical problem."
https://openalex.org/W1504875849,"We have found that the pigmentation mutant light ear in the mouse has a striking effect on lysosomes in the kidney. Male mice homozygous for the le mutant allele have a 4-fold elevated concentration of kidney beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23). The abnormal elevation of kidney beta-galactosidase is the net result of two processes. First, beta-galactosidase is elevated due to the defective urinary secretion of lysosomal enzymes which is a specific effect of the le mutation. Secondly, this effect is most evident in males and testosterone-treated females because of the induction of beta-galactosidase synthesis by testosterone, which occurs in +/+ as well as in mutant mice. The pale-ear mutation (ep) which mimics the pigmentation phenotype of le also has a similar effect on kidney lysosomes."

The overall purification was about 1,200-fold over the crude extract with a yield of about 24%. The purified enzyme had a sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) of 3.0 S. The molecular weight determinations by sedimentation equilibrium, Sephadex G-100 gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave a value of about 39,000 and, therefore, saccharopine dehydrogenase is a single polypeptide chain enzyme. A Stokes radius of 27 A and a diffusion constant of 7.9 X 10(-7) cm2 s-1 were obtained from Sephadex gel filtration chromatography. The enzyme had a high isoelectric pH of 10.1. The NH2-terminal sequence was Ala-Ala—-. The enzyme possessed 3 cysteine residues/molecule; no disulfide bond was present. Incubation of saccharopine dehydrogenase with p-chloromercuribenzoate or iodoacetate resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity. Whereas the coenzyme and substrates were ineffective in protecting from inactivation by p-chloromercuribenzoate, iodoacetate inhibition was protected by excess coenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1606888925,"Alterations in cell surface glycoproteins have been implicated in malignancy. We examined surface membrane proteins of a cultured cell line, SKCO-1, which had been derived from a human colonic adenocarcinoma. Cell surface labeling of SKCO-1 cells with galactose oxidase, followed by reduction with sodium borotritide, revealed five major labeled glycoproteins upon sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. At least three additional labeled glycoproteins could be detected if galactose oxidase treatment was preceded by neuraminidase treatment. Some, but not all, of the glycoproteins could be iodinated by lactoperoxidase. The predominantly labeled glycoprotein (GPI) had a molecular weight of 200,000 and co-migrated in SDS gel with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). GPI was not removed from the cell surface by EDTA, hypertonic saline, or sonication but was released from the membrane by detergents. This glycoprotein was subsequently purified using lectin-agarose columns and gel filtration. GPI was judged homogenous by protein- and carbohydrate-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and had an amino acid composition similar to that of CEA. The carbohydrate composition of GPI was qualitatively similar to CEA but quantitatively distinct. GPI had a greater proportion of sialic acid and galactosamine and less fucose and glucosamine than CEA. Immunological studies, however, demonstrated identity between GPI and CEA. A study of the turnover rate of GPI showed it to have a half-life of 5 days."

This enzyme was not stimulated by NAD+, NADH, or any metal ions. The optimum pH was between 7.5 and 8.0. At equilibrium of the reaction, the ratio of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to UDP-N-acetylmannosmaine was about 9:1. The enzyme was inactive toward free N-acetylhexosamines, their phosphate esters, UDP-glucose, and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine. A stimulatory role of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine was demonstrated. In the reaction with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, the rate as a function of substrate concentration showed a sigmoidal relationship with a Hill coefficient of 1.8 and an apparent Km value for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine of 1.1 mM. The reverse reaction with UDP-N-acetylmannosamine required the presence of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine concentration required for half-maximal activation was about 0.5 mM. The apparent Km for UDP-N-acetylmannosamine measured in the presence of 0.5 mM UDP-N-acetylglucosamine was 0.22mM. Other nucleotides or hexosamine derivatives were not stimulatory.

In addition to the substrate, dCMP, the enzyme requires dCTP, Zn2+, and 2-mercaptoethanol, Mg2+ cannot substitute for Zn2+. The dCMP saturation curve is hyperbolic in the presence of saturating concentrations of dCTP and Zn2+. The dCTP saturation curve is sigmoidal, the sigmoidicity being dependent on the Zn2+ and dCMP concentrations. The molecular weight as determined by gel filtration is 170,000 both in the presence and in the absence of dCTP and Zn2+. In the absence of thiols, the enzyme is highly unstable. At 0 degrees, the half-life of the enzyme activity is 30 min. Addition of Zn2+ and dCTP protects against this inactivation. In the presence of a thiol, dCTP and Zn2+ protect the enzyme against heat inactivation at 50 degrees. A mutant lacking dCMP deaminase (dcd) was isolated. Labeling of the pyrimidine nucleotide pools reveals that in the parent strain, 45% of the dTTP pool is derived via dCMP deamination, the residual 55% being derived via reduction of a uridine nucleotide. Since the dcd mutant grows with the same doubling time as the parent strain, we conclude that uridine nucleotide reduction alone is capable of supplying sufficient dUMP for normalthymidine nucleotide synthesis."

In addition, the same anti-serum showed a line of identity with an ammonium sulfate fraction which is an impure precursor of pure cytochrome P-450 side chain cleavage in two methods used for its preparation.

We interpret this to imply a stereochemical requirement for a right- handed side chain, i.e. a side chain with C-22 on the right side. Since both cholesterol and (E)-20(22)-dehydrocholes- terol, in which the side chains are not fixed rotationally about the 17(20) bond, underwent dehydrogenation, the conformers which bind to protein presumably are the right- handed ones. A second stereochemical criterion for metab- olism was found to be the absence of bulk on the front face of C-20. This derives from the observation that four addi- tional sterols with a substituent at C-20 either were not dehydrogenated or were dehydrogenated only to a limited extent. In 20-isocholesterol, 20/3-hydroxycholesterol, and 20-methylcholesterol a methyl group projects to the front in the right-handed conformation, and none of these sterols was metabolized to a significant degree. 20a-Hydroxycho- lesterol presents an hydroxyl group instead of a methyl group to the front in the right-handed conformation. It also was not dehydrogenated in the side chain. A small amount of the ‘I-dehydro derivative was obtained, but the quantity was less than in the case of sterols lacking bulk greater than a hydrogen atom in the same steric position. The ability of the organism to metabolize the trigonal and therefore planar (E)-A17(20’- and (E&A Z0(20)-sterols proves that tetrahed- ral character at C-20 is not necessary and that no bulk in the perpendicular plane is required."

In wild type infection P31 synthesis ceases at late times; in contrast, P31 is overproduced in certain early or regulatory T4 mutant infections, particularly gene 55 mutant infections. P31 was purified preparatively from Escherichia coli infected with the latter mutant, but could only be obtained for the most part in modified form, possibly due to unusual sensitivity to a proteolytic activity. P31 is not cleaved in vivo during normal head assembly, nor does it become a part of the mature head or any ordered prehead structure as determined by an immunological assay using antiserum prepared against the purified protein. However P31 does appear to become a part of the unordered P23 aggregates (lumps) which accumulate when ordered P23 assembly is prevented. We cound find no evidence for P31 association with T4 DNA or the host membrane. Our experiments favor the hypothesis that P31 directly affects the aggregation state and solubility properties of P23."
