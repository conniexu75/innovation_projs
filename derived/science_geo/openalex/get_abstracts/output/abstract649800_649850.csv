https://openalex.org/W3013594674,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions were undertaken to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, affected COVID-19 spread in China. We used real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation in transmission in cities across China and to ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was explained well by human mobility data. After the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases were still indicative of local chains of transmission outside of Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19."

Following recent demonstrations that some types of cancer show substantial microbial contributions1-10, we re-examined whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing studies in The Cancer Genome Atlas11 (TCGA) of 33 types of cancer from treatment-naive patients (a total of 18,116 samples) for microbial reads, and found unique microbial signatures in tissue and blood within and between most major types of cancer. These TCGA blood signatures remained predictive when applied to patients with stage Ia-IIc cancer and cancers lacking any genomic alterations currently measured on two commercial-grade cell-free tumour DNA platforms, despite the use of very stringent decontamination analyses that discarded up to 92.3% of total sequence data. In addition, we could discriminate among samples from healthy, cancer-free individuals (n = 69) and those from patients with multiple types of cancer (prostate, lung, and melanoma; 100 samples in total) solely using plasma-derived, cell-free microbial nucleic acids. This potential microbiome-based oncology diagnostic tool warrants further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3012090404,"Consumption of fructose has risen markedly in recent decades owing to the use of sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup in beverages and processed foods1, and this has contributed to increasing rates of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease2-4. Fructose intake triggers de novo lipogenesis in the liver4-6, in which carbon precursors of acetyl-CoA are converted into fatty acids. The ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) enzyme cleaves cytosolic citrate to generate acetyl-CoA, and is upregulated after consumption of carbohydrates7. Clinical trials are currently pursuing the inhibition of ACLY as a treatment for metabolic diseases8. However, the route from dietary fructose to hepatic acetyl-CoA and lipids remains unknown. Here, using in vivo isotope tracing, we show that liver-specific deletion of Acly in mice is unable to suppress fructose-induced lipogenesis. Dietary fructose is converted to acetate by the gut microbiota9, and this supplies lipogenic acetyl-CoA independently of ACLY10. Depletion of the microbiota or silencing of hepatic ACSS2, which generates acetyl-CoA from acetate, potently suppresses the conversion of bolus fructose into hepatic acetyl-CoA and fatty acids. When fructose is consumed more gradually to facilitate its absorption in the small intestine, both citrate cleavage in hepatocytes and microorganism-derived acetate contribute to lipogenesis. By contrast, the lipogenic transcriptional program is activated in response to fructose in a manner that is independent of acetyl-CoA metabolism. These data reveal a two-pronged mechanism that regulates hepatic lipogenesis, in which fructolysis within hepatocytes provides a signal to promote the expression of lipogenic genes, and the generation of microbial acetate feeds lipogenic pools of acetyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W3013447908,"Spin-triplet superconductivity is a condensate of electron pairs with spin-1 and an odd-parity wavefunction. A particularly interesting manifestation of triplet pairing is a chiral p-wave state which is topologically non-trivial and a natural platform for realizing Majorana edge modes. Triplet pairing is however rare in solid state systems and so far, no unambiguous identification has been made in any bulk compound. Since pairing is most naturally mediated by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations, uranium based heavy fermion systems containing f electron elements that can harbor both strong correlations and magnetism are considered ideal candidate spin-triplet superconductors. In this work we present scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of the newly discovered heavy fermion superconductor, UTe2 with a T$_{SC}$ of 1.6 K. We find signatures of coexisting Kondo effect and superconductivity which show competing spatial modulations within one unit-cell. STM spectroscopy at step edges show signatures of chiral in-gap states, predicted to exist at the boundaries of a topological superconductor. Combined with existing data indicating triplet pairing, the presence of chiral edge states suggests that UTe2 is a strong candidate material for chiral-triplet topological superconductivity."

https://openalex.org/W3010790669,"Carbonaceous (C-type) asteroids1 are relics of the early Solar System that have preserved primitive materials since their formation approximately 4.6 billion years ago. They are probably analogues of carbonaceous chondrites2,3 and are essential for understanding planetary formation processes. However, their physical properties remain poorly known because carbonaceous chondrite meteoroids tend not to survive entry to Earth’s atmosphere. Here we report on global one-rotation thermographic images of the C-type asteroid 162173 Ryugu, taken by the thermal infrared imager (TIR)4 onboard the spacecraft Hayabusa25, indicating that the asteroid’s boulders and their surroundings have similar temperatures, with a derived thermal inertia of about 300 J m−2 s−0.5 K−1 (300 tiu). Contrary to predictions that the surface consists of regolith and dense boulders, this low thermal inertia suggests that the boulders are more porous than typical carbonaceous chondrites6 and that their surroundings are covered with porous fragments more than 10 centimetres in diameter. Close-up thermal images confirm the presence of such porous fragments and the flat diurnal temperature profiles suggest a strong surface roughness effect7,8. We also observed in the close-up thermal images boulders that are colder during the day, with thermal inertia exceeding 600 tiu, corresponding to dense boulders similar to typical carbonaceous chondrites6. These results constrain the formation history of Ryugu: the asteroid must be a rubble pile formed from impact fragments of a parent body with microporosity9 of approximately 30 to 50 per cent that experienced a low degree of consolidation. The dense boulders might have originated from the consolidated innermost region or they may have an exogenic origin. This high-porosity asteroid may link cosmic fluffy dust to dense celestial bodies10. Thermal imaging data obtained from the spacecraft Hayabusa2 reveal that the carbonaceous asteroid 162173 Ryugu is an object of unusually high porosity."

https://openalex.org/W3011742814,"The conserved yeast E3 ubiquitin ligase Bre1 and its partner, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rad6, monoubiquitinate histone H2B across gene bodies during the transcription cycle1. Although processive ubiquitination might—in principle—arise from Bre1 and Rad6 travelling with RNA polymerase II2, the mechanism of H2B ubiquitination across genic nucleosomes remains unclear. Here we implicate liquid–liquid phase separation3 as the underlying mechanism. Biochemical reconstitution shows that Bre1 binds the scaffold protein Lge1, which possesses an intrinsically disordered region that phase-separates via multivalent interactions. The resulting condensates comprise a core of Lge1 encapsulated by an outer catalytic shell of Bre1. This layered liquid recruits Rad6 and the nucleosomal substrate, which accelerates the ubiquitination of H2B. In vivo, the condensate-forming region of Lge1 is required to ubiquitinate H2B in gene bodies beyond the +1 nucleosome. Our data suggest that layered condensates of histone-modifying enzymes generate chromatin-associated ‘reaction chambers’, with augmented catalytic activity along gene bodies. Equivalent processes may occur in human cells, and cause neurological disease when impaired. The yeast E3 ligase Bre1 forms a core–shell condensate with the scaffold protein Lge1, implicating liquid–liquid phase separation as a mechanism in the ubiquitination of histone H2B along gene bodies."
https://openalex.org/W3013968107,"Cannabis related online searches are associated with positive attitudes toward medical cannabis, particularly when information is obtained from dispensaries. Since pain is the main reason for medicinal cannabis use, information from dispensary websites has the potential to shape the attitude of pain patients towards cannabis. This is relevant because cannabis has demonstrated efficacy in neuropathic pain with low tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentrations (< 5-10%), in contrast to potent cannabis (>15% THC), which is highly rewarded in the recreational realm. The role of CBD in pain is not clear, however it has gained popularity. Thus, we hypothesize that the potency of medical cannabis that is advertised online is similar to the cannabis advertised for recreational purposes, which would potentially create a misconception towards medical cannabis. The current lack of knowledge surrounding advertised potencies in the legal cannabis market limits the ability to generate clear policies regarding online advertising to protect patients that are willing to use cannabis for their condition. Thus, we evaluated the advertised THC and CBD content of cannabis products offered online in dispensaries in the United States to determine products' suitability to medicinal use and compare the strength of products offered in legal medical and recreational programs. We recorded THC and CBD concentrations for all herb cannabis products provided by dispensary websites and compared them between or within states. Four Western states (CA, CO, NM, WA) and five Northeastern states (ME, MA, NH, RI, VT) were included. A total of 8,505 cannabis products across 653 dispensaries were sampled. Despite the clear differences between medicinal and recreational uses of cannabis, the average THC concentration advertised online in medicinal programs was similar (19.2% ±6.2) to recreational programs (21.5% ±6.0) when compared between states with different programs, or between medicinal and recreational programs within the same states (CO or WA). Lower CBD concentrations accompanied higher THC products. The majority of products, regardless of medicinal or recreational programs, were advertised to have >15% THC (70.3% - 91.4% of products). These stated concentrations seem unsuitable for medicinal purposes, particularly for patients with chronic neuropathic pain. Therefore, this information could induce the misconception that high potency cannabis is safe to treat pain. This data is consistent with reports in which THC and CBD in products from legal dispensaries or in nationwide products from the illegal market were actually measured, which indicates that patients consuming these products may be at risk of acute intoxication or long-term side effects. Our study offers grounds to develop policies that help prevent misconceptions toward cannabis and reduce risks in pain patients."

https://openalex.org/W3013462789,"Precision medicine in oncology aims at obtaining data from heterogeneous sources to have a precise estimation of a given patient’s state and prognosis. With the purpose of advancing to personalized medicine framework, accurate diagnoses allow prescription of more effective treatments adapted to the specificities of each individual case. In the last years, next-generation sequencing has impelled cancer research by providing physicians with an overwhelming amount of gene-expression data from RNA-seq high-throughput platforms. In this scenario, data mining and machine learning techniques have widely contribute to gene-expression data analysis by supplying computational models to supporting decision-making on real-world data. Nevertheless, existing public gene-expression databases are characterized by the unfavorable imbalance between the huge number of genes (in the order of tenths of thousands) and the small number of samples (in the order of a few hundreds) available. Despite diverse feature selection and extraction strategies have been traditionally applied to surpass derived over-fitting issues, the efficacy of standard machine learning pipelines is far from being satisfactory for the prediction of relevant clinical outcomes like follow-up end-points or patient’s survival. Using the public Pan-Cancer dataset, in this study we pre-train convolutional neural network architectures for survival prediction on a subset composed of thousands of gene-expression samples from thirty-one tumor types. The resulting architectures are subsequently fine-tuned to predict lung cancer progression-free interval. The application of convolutional networks to gene-expression data has many limitations, derived from the unstructured nature of these data. In this work we propose a methodology to rearrange RNA-seq data by transforming RNA-seq samples into gene-expression images, from which convolutional networks can extract high-level features. As an additional objective, we investigate whether leveraging the information extracted from other tumor-type samples contributes to the extraction of high-level features that improve lung cancer progression prediction, compared to other machine learning approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3013089882,"The broad applications of ultrawide-band signals and terahertz waves in quantum measurements1,2, imaging and sensing techniques3,4, advanced biological treatments5, and very-high-data-rate communications6 have drawn extensive attention to ultrafast electronics. In such applications, high-speed operation of electronic switches is challenging, especially when high-amplitude output signals are required7. For instance, although field-effect and bipolar junction devices have good controllability and robust performance, their relatively large output capacitance with respect to their ON-state current substantially limits their switching speed8. Here we demonstrate a novel on-chip, all-electronic device based on a nanoscale plasma (nanoplasma) that enables picosecond switching of electric signals with a wide range of power levels. The very high electric field in the small volume of the nanoplasma leads to ultrafast electron transfer, resulting in extremely short time responses. We achieved an ultrafast switching speed, higher than 10 volts per picosecond, which is about two orders of magnitude larger than that of field-effect transistors and more than ten times faster than that of conventional electronic switches. We measured extremely short rise times down to five picoseconds, which were limited by the employed measurement set-up. By integrating these devices with dipole antennas, high-power terahertz signals with a power–frequency trade-off of 600 milliwatts terahertz squared were emitted, much greater than that achieved by the state of the art in compact solid-state electronics. The ease of integration and the compactness of the nanoplasma switches could enable their implementation in several fields, such as imaging, sensing, communications and biomedical applications. An on-chip, all-electronic device based on the formation of a nanoplasma provides ultrafast electron transfer, enabling picosecond switching of electric signals and the generation of high-power terahertz pulses."
https://openalex.org/W3013829185,"Excitation in neural circuits must be carefully controlled by inhibition to regulate information processing and network excitability. During development, cortical inhibitory and excitatory inputs are initially mismatched but become co-tuned or balanced with experience. However, little is known about how excitatory-inhibitory balance is defined at most synapses or about the mechanisms for establishing or maintaining this balance at specific set points. Here we show how coordinated long-term plasticity calibrates populations of excitatory-inhibitory inputs onto mouse auditory cortical pyramidal neurons. Pairing pre- and postsynaptic activity induced plasticity at paired inputs and different forms of heterosynaptic plasticity at the strongest unpaired synapses, which required minutes of activity and dendritic Ca2+ signaling to be computed. Theoretical analyses demonstrated how the relative rate of heterosynaptic plasticity could normalize and stabilize synaptic strengths to achieve any possible excitatory-inhibitory correlation. Thus, excitatory-inhibitory balance is dynamic and cell specific, determined by distinct plasticity rules across multiple excitatory and inhibitory synapses."

https://openalex.org/W3013463461,"Parasitic diseases are a neglected and serious problem, especially in underdeveloped countries. Among the major parasitic diseases, Leishmaniasis figures as an urgent challenge due to its high incidence and severity. At the same time, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics by the population is increasing together with resistance to medicines. To address this problem, new antibiotic-like molecules that directly kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms are necessary, where antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) can be of great help. In this work, the ferrocene molecule, one active compound with low levels of in vivo toxicity, was coupled to the N-terminus of the RP1 peptide (derived from the human chemokine CXCL4), aiming to evaluate how this change modifies the structure, biological activity, and toxicity of the peptide. The peptide and the conjugate were synthesized using the solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Circular dichroism assays in PBS showed that the RP1 peptide and its conjugate had a typical spectrum for disordered structures. The Fc-RP1 presented anti-amastigote activity against Leishmania amazonensis (IC50 = 0.25 μmol L–1). In comparison with amphotericin B, a second-line drug approved for leishmaniasis treatment, (IC50 = 0.63 μmol L-1), Fc-RP1 was more active and showed a 2.5-fold higher selectivity index. The RP1 peptide presented a MIC of 4.3 μmol L-1 against S. agalactiae, whilst Fc-RP1 was four times more active (MIC = 0.96 μmol L-1), indicating that ferrocene improved the antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The Fc-RP1 peptide also decreased the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the assays against E. faecalis (MIC = 7.9 μmol L-1), E. coli (MIC = 3.9 μmol L-1) and S. aureus (MIC = 3.9 μmol L-1). The cytotoxicity of the compounds was tested against HaCaT cells, and no significant activity at the highest concentration tested (500 μg. mL-1) was observed, showing the high potential of this new compound as a possible new drug. The coupling of ferrocene also increased the vesicle permeabilization of the peptide, showing a direct relation between high peptide concentration and high carboxyfluorescein release, which indicates the action mechanism by pore formation on the vesicles. Several studies have shown that ferrocene destabilizes cell membranes through lipid peroxidation, leading to cell lysis. It is noteworthy that the Fc-RP1 peptide synthesized here is a prototype of a bioconjugation strategy, but it still is a compound with great biological activity against neglected and fish diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3014045442,"Background Tumor cells with a mesenchymal phenotype and/or cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are known to contribute to metastasis and drug resistance. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CTCs reflecting a dedifferentiated CSC phenotype may not be detected using only an anti-EpCAM antibody to capture them. We used an antibody-independent CTC enrichment platform, ApoStream®, which does not rely on any antibody, including anti-EpCAM, to capture EMT- and CSC-CTCs in breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and correlated them to pathological complete response (pCR). Methods Blood samples from newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were prospectively collected before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (T0), after chemotherapy but before surgery (T1), and after surgery (T2) and processed using ApoStream. CTCs detected were stained with additional markers to define 3 CTC subsets with the following phenotypes: epithelial CTCs (CK+, EpCAM+ or E-cadherin+), EMT-CTCs (β-catenin+ or vimentin+), and CSC-CTCs (CD44+ and CD24low). Results We enrolled 55 patients, 47 of which had data for analysis. EMT-CTCs were detected in 57%, 62%, and 72% and CSC-CTCs in 9%, 22%, and 19% at the T0, T1, and T2 time points, respectively. Counts of epithelial (P = 0.225) and EMT (P = 0.522) phenotypes of CTCs at T0 did not significantly predict pCR. Moreover, no correlation between CTC count change and pCR was demonstrated. Conclusions ApoStream was successful in detecting EMT-CTCs among patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, EMT-/CSC-CTC counts did not correlate with pCR. Due to the small sample size and heterogeneity of this patient population, further study in a larger cohort of molecularly homogeneous patients is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3013658122,"Bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharides (or endotoxin) cause systemic inflammation, resulting in a substantial global health burden. The onset, progression, and resolution of the inflammatory response to endotoxin are usually tightly controlled to avoid chronic inflammation. Members of the NF-κB family of transcription factors are key drivers of inflammation that activate sets of genes in response to inflammatory signals. Such responses are typically short-lived and can be suppressed by proteins that act post-translationally, such as the SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) family. Less is known about direct transcriptional regulation of these responses, however. Here, using a combination of in vitro approaches and in vivo animal models, we show that endotoxin treatment induced expression of the well-characterized transcriptional repressor Kruppel-like factor 3 (KLF3), which, in turn, directly repressed the expression of the NF-κB family member RELA/p65. We also observed that KLF3-deficient mice were hypersensitive to endotoxin and exhibited elevated levels of circulating Ly6C+ monocytes and macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokines. These findings reveal that KLF3 is a fundamental suppressor that operates as a feedback inhibitor of RELA/p65 and may be important in facilitating the resolution of inflammation."

The distribution of the players´ birth dates (by quartile: Q, and semester: S) by categories, handball playing positions, and membership of continental federations, were analysed for each of the three two-year periods in which the World Handball Championships took place. Differences between the observed and expected birth dates were tested using a chi-square goodness of fit test, and subsequent calculations were tested using odds ratios. The Spearman’s correlation coefficient was applied to test the correlation between the relative age of the athletes and (their) performance parameters. The results revealed a prevalence of the RAE on both male and female in the U-19 and U-21 categories (p<0.001), and a stabilisation of the RAE throughout the period analysed (2013/14-2017/2018). The RAE was not found in the female senior category (2013, 2015 and 2017) or male senior category (2013) (p>0.05). All playing positions were impacted by the RAE (p<0.001), and especially strong effect sizes were noted for male pivots (Vc = 0.66/0.68/0.60) and female center backs (Vc = 0.71/0.65/0.71). In our analysis of the handball continental federations, the RAE was found in all regions, except Oceania (p>0.05). The RAE also affected athlete performance: the oldest athletes played more minutes and achieved better performances. The RAE was associated with the final placement of the teams in each championship category, except in the male youth category. The findings clearly demonstrated that the RAE has a significant impact on the selection of male and female athletes to international competitions and the performance of both men and women in international handball. The potential implications of these findings for policy and practice are discussed."

The new sensors, based on optical technologies, respond to a number of scientific, technical and societal objectives, ranging from more precise monitoring of key environmental descriptors of the aquatic environment (water colour, transparency and fluorescence) to an improved management of data collected with citizen participation. The sensors were tested, calibrated, integrated on several platforms, scientifically validated and demonstrated in the field. The new methods and tools were tested in a citizen-science context. The general conclusion is that citizens are valuable contributors in quality and quantity to the objective of collecting, integrating and analysing fragmented and diverse environmental data. An integration of these data into data-analysis tools has a large potential to support authoritative monitoring and decision-making. In this paper, the project's objectives, results, technical achievements and lessons learned are presented."
https://openalex.org/W3013338561,"Mammalian oocytes rely heavily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for generating ATP. However, mitochondria are also the primary source of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial de-regulation, therefore, underpins poor oocyte quality associated with conditions such as obesity and aging. The mitochondrial sirtuin, Sirt3, is critical for mitochondrial respiration and redox regulation. Interestingly, however, Sirt3 knockout (Sirt3−/−) mice do not exhibit systemic compromise under basal conditions, only doing so under stressed conditions such as high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Mouse oocytes depleted of Sirt3 exhibit increased ROS in vitro, but it is unknown whether Sirt3 is necessary for female fertility in vivo. Here, we test this for the first time by investigating ovarian follicular reserve, oocyte maturation (including detailed spindle assembly and chromosome segregation), and female fertility in Sirt3−/− females. We find that under basal conditions, young Sirt3−/− females exhibit no defects in any parameters. Surprisingly, all parameters also remain intact following HFD-induced obesity. Despite markedly increased ROS levels in HFD Sirt3−/− oocytes, ATP levels nevertheless remain normal. Our data support that ATP is sustained in vivo through increased mitochondrial mass possibly secondary to compensatory upregulation of another sirtuin, Sirt1, which has overlapping functions with Sirt3."
https://openalex.org/W3013846376,"Smartphones provide an ideal platform for colorimetric measurements due to their low cost, portability and image quality. As with any imaging-based colorimetry system, ambient light and device variations introduce error which must be dealt with. We propose a novel processing method consisting of a one-time calibration stage to account for inter-phone variations, and an innovative use of ambient light subtraction with image pairs to account for variation in ambient light. Data collection is kept very simple, making it particularly useful for use in the field, since nothing additional is required in the images. Ambient subtraction is first demonstrated for a range of colors and phones (Samsung S8 and LG Nexus 5X), and the Subtracted Signal to Noise Ratio (SSNR) is defined as a metric for assessing whether an image pair is appropriate at the time of image capture. The experimentally determined SSNR threshold below which to suggest retaking the images is 3.4. The classification accuracy for results using the proposed calibration pipeline is then compared to the simplest image metadata-based alternative and is found to be greatly superior. Finally, a custom colorcard is shown to improve the accuracy of device-independent results for known smaller ranges of colors over a standard colorcard, making this a possible application-specific modification to the overall processing pipeline."
https://openalex.org/W3013575207,"Circadian clock confers temporal control in metabolism, with its disruption leading to the development of insulin resistance. Metabolic substrate utilization in skeletal muscle is coordinated with diurnal nutrient cycles. However, whether the molecular clock is involved in this coordination is largely unknown. Using a myocyte-selective genetic ablation mouse model of the essential clock activator Bmal1, here we identify muscle-intrinsic clock as a sensor of feeding cues to orchestrate skeletal muscle oxidation required for global nutrient flux. Bmal1 in skeletal muscle responds robustly to feeding in vivo and insulin induces its expression. Muscle Bmal1 deficiency impaired the transcriptional control of glucose metabolic pathway, resulting in markedly attenuated glucose utilization and fasting hyperglycemia. Notably, the loss of Bmal1 response to feeding abolished fasting-to-feeding metabolic fuel switch from fatty acids to glucose in skeletal muscle, leading to the activation of energy-sensing pathways for fatty acid oxidation. These altered metabolic substrate oxidations in Bmal1-deficient muscle ultimately depleted circulating lipid levels that prevented hepatic steatosis. Collectively, our findings highlight the key role of the metabolic-sensing function of skeletal muscle clock in partitioning nutrient flux between muscle and liver to maintain whole-body lipid and glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3013141440,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) are shown to be involved in the progression of several types of kidney diseases. Podocytes maintain the integrity of the glomerular basement membrane. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are important in cell-to-cell communication as they can transfer cellular content between cells, including miRNA. However, little is known about how extracellular signals from the glomerular microenvironment regulate podocyte activity. Using a non-contact transwell system, communication between glomerular endothelial cells (GEnC) and podocytes was characterised in-vitro. Identification of transferred EV-miRNAs from GEnC to podocytes was performed using fluorescence cell tracking and miRNA mimetics. To represent kidney disease, podocyte molecular profiling and functions were analysed after EV treatments derived from steady state or activated GEnC. Our data shows activation of GEnC alters EV-miRNA loading, but activation was not found to alter EV secretion. EV delivery of miRNA to recipient podocytes altered cellular miRNA abundance and effector functions in podocytes, including decreased secretion of VEGF and increased mitochondrial stress which lead to altered cellular metabolism and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Finally, results support our hypothesis that miRNA-200c-3p is transfered by EVs from GEnC to podocytes in response to activation, ultimately leading to podocyte dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3013585454,"Despite the harm caused by binge drinking, the neural mechanisms leading to risky and disinhibited intoxication-related behaviors are not well understood. Evidence suggests that the globus pallidus externus (GPe), a substructure within the basal ganglia, participates in inhibitory control processes, as examined in stop-signaling tasks. In fact, studies in rodents have revealed that alcohol can change GPe activity by decreasing neuronal firing rates, suggesting that the GPe may have a central role in explaining impulsive behaviors and failures of inhibition that occur during binge drinking. In this study, twenty-five healthy volunteers underwent intravenous alcohol infusion to achieve a blood alcohol level of 0.08 g/dl, which is equivalent to a binge drinking episode. A resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan was collected prior to the infusion and at binge-level exposure. Functional connectivity analysis was used to investigate the association between alcohol-induced changes in GPe connectivity, drinking behaviors, and impulsivity traits. We found that individuals with greater number of drinks or heavy drinking days in the recent past had greater alcohol-induced deficits in GPe connectivity, particularly to the striatum. Our data also indicated an association between impulsivity and alcohol-induced deficits in GPe—frontal/precentral connectivity. Moreover, alcohol induced changes in GPe-amygdala circuitry suggested greater vulnerabilities to stress-related drinking in some individuals. Taken together, these findings suggest that alcohol may interact with impulsive personality traits and drinking patterns to drive alterations in GPe circuitry associated with behavioral inhibition, possibly indicating a neural mechanism by which binge drinking could lead to impulsive behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3014044068,"Objective To investigate the effect and mechanism of SB525334 on self-renewal, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer stem cells. Methods ALDHhigh-expressing cancer stem cells (CSCs) were isolated from human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 by flow cytometry and treated with 2μg/mL SB525334 for 6h. The sphere forming assay was used to detect the ability of self-renewal of CSCs and the colony formation assay was used to detect the tumorigenicity in vitro. Transwell migration and invasion assay were used to detect the migration and invasion ability of CSCs. To further explore the mechanism, real-time quantitative PCR and flow cytometry were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression of TGF-β, Smad2, Smad3, phosphorylated Smad2, phosphorylated Smad3 and Smad4, respectively. Expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes E-cadherin, Snail, Vimentin were also assessed. Results The self-renewal ability, tumorigenicity in vitro, migration and invasion ability of CSCs were significantly attenuated after SB525334 treatment. The expressions of TGF-β, phosphorylated Smad2, phosphorylated Smad3, Snail, and Vimentin were decreased, while Smad4 and E-cadherin expressions were increased. Conclusion SB525334 may inhibit the self-renewal, invasion and migration of ovarian CSCs by blocking the TGF-β/Smad/EMT pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3013302732,"Mitochondrial aconitase (Aco2) catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate in the TCA cycle, which produces NADH and FADH2, driving synthesis of ATP through OXPHOS. In this study, to explore the relationship between adipogenesis and mitochondrial energy metabolism, we hypothesize that Aco2 may play a key role in the lipid synthesis. Here, we show that overexpression of Aco2 in 3T3-L1 cells significantly increased lipogenesis and adipogenesis, accompanied by elevated mitochondrial biogenesis and ATP production. However, when ATP is depleted by rotenone, an inhibitor of the respiratory chain, the promotive role of Aco2 in adipogenesis is abolished. In contrast to Aco2 overexpression, deficiency of Aco2 markedly reduced lipogenesis and adipogenesis, along with the decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and ATP production. Supplementation of isocitrate efficiently rescued the inhibitory effect of Aco2 deficiency. Similarly, the restorative effect of isocitrate was abolished in the presence of rotenone. Together, these results show that Aco2 sustains normal adipogenesis through mediating ATP production, revealing a potential mechanistic link between TCA cycle enzyme and lipid synthesis. Our work suggest that regulation of adipose tissue mitochondria function may be a potential way for combating abnormal adipogenesis related diseases such as obesity and lipodystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W3013782738,"Statins, a class of drugs that can effectively remove cholesterol from serum, are used to regulate plasma total cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, but it is still unclear whether the drug are modulated by gut microbiota or the structures of gut microbiota are shaped by statins. We investigated the interactions between statins and the human gut microbiota during the in vitro fermentation process by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, gas chromatography (GC), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. The presence of fluvastatin (FLU2) specifically promoted the growth of Escherichia/Shigella, Ruminococcaceae UCG 014, and Sutterella. However, the composition of the gut bacterial microbiota remained relatively static in samples treated with rosuvastatin (ROS), simvastatin (SIM), and atorvastatin (ATO). The PICRUSt program predicted moderate differences in the functional categories related to the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, cellular processes and signaling, and signal transduction in the FLU2 fermentation samples. Our study revealed substantial variation in the structure and function of microbiomes from the FLU2-treated samples. In addition, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were also significantly decreased in FLU2-treated samples compared with the samples treated with other stains. Statins can be degraded by the human gut microbiota in vitro, and the degradation rate was approximately 7%–30% and 19%–48% after fermentation was allowed to proceed for 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Generally, FLU2 could largely shape the composition and function of human gut microbiota, which resulted in changes in the production of SCFAs. In turn, all statins could be degraded or modified by the gut microbiota. Our study paves the way for elucidating statin-gut microbiota interactions in vitro towards the improvement of the host health and personalized medicine."

https://openalex.org/W3013159333,"Streptococcus pyogenes is a strict human pathogen responsible for more than 700 million infections annually worldwide. Strains of serotype M28 S. pyogenes are typically among the five more abundant types causing invasive infections and pharyngitis in adults and children. Type M28 strains also have an unusual propensity to cause puerperal sepsis and neonatal disease. We recently discovered that a one-nucleotide indel in an intergenic homopolymeric tract located between genes Spy1336/R28 and Spy1337 altered virulence in a mouse model of infection. In the present study, we analyzed size variation in this homopolymeric tract and determined the extent of heterogeneity in the number of tandemly-repeated 79-amino acid domains in the coding region of Spy1336/R28 in large samples of strains recovered from humans with invasive infections. Both repeat sequence elements are highly polymorphic in natural populations of M28 strains. Variation in the homopolymeric tract results in (i) changes in transcript levels of Spy1336/R28 and Spy1337 in vitro, (ii) differences in virulence in a mouse model of necrotizing myositis, and (iii) global transcriptome changes as shown by RNAseq analysis of isogenic mutant strains. Variation in the number of tandem repeats in the coding sequence of Spy1336/R28 is responsible for size variation of R28 protein in natural populations. Isogenic mutant strains in which genes encoding R28 or transcriptional regulator Spy1337 are inactivated are significantly less virulent in a nonhuman primate model of necrotizing myositis. Our findings provide impetus for additional studies addressing the role of R28 and Spy1337 variation in pathogen-host interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3013541099,"Abstract A Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP), deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1), is known to function as a tumor suppressor in various cancer types; however, whether DLC1 is a tumor-suppressor gene or an oncogene in melanoma remains to be clarified. Here we revealed that high DLC1 expression was detected in most of the melanoma tissues where it was localized in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm. Functional studies unveiled that DLC1 was both required and sufficient for melanoma growth and metastasis. These tumorigenic events were mediated by nuclear-localized DLC1 in a RhoGAP-independent manner. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry analysis identified a DLC1-associated protein, FOXK1 transcription factor, which mediated oncogenic events in melanoma by translocating and retaining DLC1 into the nucleus. RNA-sequencing profiling studies further revealed MMP9 as a direct target of FOXK1 through DLC1-regulated promoter occupancy for cooperative activation of MMP9 expression to promote melanoma invasion and metastasis. Concerted action of DLC1–FOXK1 in MMP9 gene regulation was further supported by their highly correlated expression in melanoma patients’ samples and cell lines. Together, our results not only unravel a mechanism by which nuclear DLC1 functions as an oncogene in melanoma but also suggest an unexpected role of RhoGAP protein in transcriptional regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3013552333,"Background and purpose The aim of this study is to investigate changes in movement behaviors, sedentary behavior and physical activity, and to identify potential movement behavior trajectory subgroups within the first two months after discharge from the hospital to the home setting in first-time stroke patients. Methods A total of 140 participants were included. Within three weeks after discharge, participants received an accelerometer, which they wore continuously for five weeks to objectively measure movement behavior outcomes. The movement behavior outcomes of interest were the mean time spent in sedentary behavior (SB), light physical activity (LPA) and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA); the mean time spent in MVPA bouts ≥ 10 minutes; and the weighted median sedentary bout. Generalized estimation equation analyses were performed to investigate overall changes in movement behavior outcomes. Latent class growth analyses were performed to identify patient subgroups of movement behavior outcome trajectories. Results In the first week, the participants spent an average, of 9.22 hours (67.03%) per day in SB, 3.87 hours (27.95%) per day in LPA and 0.70 hours (5.02%) per day in MVPA. Within the entire sample, a small but significant decrease in SB and increase in LPA were found in the first weeks in the home setting. For each movement behavior outcome variable, two or three distinctive subgroup trajectories were found. Although subgroup trajectories for each movement behavior outcome were identified, no relevant changes over time were found. Conclusion Overall, the majority of stroke survivors are highly sedentary and a substantial part is inactive in the period immediately after discharge from hospital care. Movement behavior outcomes remain fairly stable during this period, although distinctive subgroup trajectories were found for each movement behavior outcome. Future research should investigate whether movement behavior outcomes cluster in patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3013782216,"Background Events in pregnancy play an important role in predisposing the newborn to the risk of developing CHD. This study evaluated the association between maternal preeclampsia and her offspring risk of CHD. Methods This is a cohort study of 90 sex-matched neonates (45 each born to women with preeclampsia and normal pregnancy) in Jos, Nigeria. Anthropometry was taken shortly after delivery using standard protocols. Echocardiography was performed within 24 hours of life and repeated 7 and 28 days later. SPSS version 25 was used in all analyses. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results Congenital heart disease (CHD) was observed in 27 (30.0%) of newborns of women with preeclampsia compared with 11 (12.1%) of newborns without preeclampsia (p<0.001) at the end of 7 days and in 19 (21.1%) of newborns of women with preeclampsia and 3 (3.3%) of newborns of women without preeclampsia by the end of the 4th week of life (p<0.001). Overall, ASD (4 newborns), PDA (21 newborns), patent foramen ovale (14 newborns) and VSD (2 newborns) were the prevalent lesions found among all the newborns studied in the first week of life. Isolated atrial and ventricular septal defects were seen in 4 (4.4%) of the newborns of women with preeclampsia. Being the infant of a woman with preeclampsia was associated with about 8-fold increased risk of having CHD (OR = 7.9, 95% CI = 2.5–24.9, p<0.001). Conclusion CHD may be more common in newborns of women with preeclampsia underscoring the need for fetal and newborn screening for CHD in women with preeclampsia so as to improve their infant’s well being."
https://openalex.org/W3013890775,"Background Food taxes and subsidies are one intervention to address poor diets. Price elasticity (PE) matrices are commonly used to model the change in food purchasing. Usually a PE matrix is generated in one setting then applied to another setting with differing starting consumption and prices of foods. This violates econometric assumptions resulting in likely misestimation of total food consumption. We illustrate rescaling all consumption after applying a PE matrix using a total food expenditure elasticity (TFEe, the expenditure elasticity for all food combined given the policy induced change in the total price of food). We use case studies of NZ$2 per 100g saturated fat (SAFA) tax, NZ$0.4 per 100g sugar tax, and a 20% fruit and vegetable (F&V) subsidy. Methods We estimated changes in food purchasing using a NZ PE matrix applied conventionally, then with TFEe adjustment. Impacts were quantified for total food expenditure and health adjusted life years (HALYs) for the total NZ population alive in 2011 over the rest of their lifetime using a multistate lifetable model. Results Two NZ studies gave TFEes of 0.68 and 0.83, with international estimates ranging from 0.46 to 0.90. Without TFEe adjustment, total food expenditure decreased with the tax policies and increased with the F&V subsidy, implausible directions of shift given economic theory. After TFEe adjustment, HALY gains reduced by a third to a half for the two taxes and reversed from an apparent health loss to a health gain for the F&V subsidy. With TFEe adjustment, HALY gains (in 1000s) were 1,805 (95% uncertainty interval 1,337 to 2,340) for the SAFA tax, 1,671 (1,220 to 2,269) for the sugar tax, and 953 (453 to 1,308) for the F&V subsidy. Conclusions If PE matrices are applied in settings beyond where they were derived, additional scaling is likely required. We suggest that the TFEe is a useful scalar."
https://openalex.org/W3013022058,Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the degree of visual fatigue in patients with intermittent exotropia (IXT) using the binocular fusion maintenance (BFM) test. Methods Fourteen patients with IXT (32.1 ± 16.4 years) and 15 age-matched healthy volunteers (31.2 ± 9.3 years) participated in the study. BFM was assessed by measuring the transmittance of liquid crystals placed in front of the subject's nondominant eye at the instance when binocular fusion was broken and vergence eye movement was induced. A questionnaire on subjective symptoms was administered to the subjects before and after the visual task. The visual task consisted of a reciprocal movement between 67 and 40 cm. Results The change [post–pre] of BFM was significantly lower in the IXT group (−0.185 ± 0.187) than in the control group (−0.030 ± 0.070) (P = 0.010). The change of total subjective eye symptom score was significantly greater in the IXT group (2.28 ± 1.43) than in the control group (0.93 ± 1.27) (P = 0.018). The reduction in BFM rate with increasing total subjective eye symptom score was significantly greater in the IXT group (−0.106 ± 0.017) than in the control group (−0.030 ± 0.013) (P = 0.006). Conclusion The present findings objectively showed that patients with IXT are at a greater risk of visual fatigue in comparison with healthy individuals.
https://openalex.org/W3013197428,"Rapid Alkalinization Factors (RALFs) are cysteine-rich peptides ubiquitous within plant kingdom. They play multiple roles as hormonal signals in diverse processes, including root elongation, cell growth, pollen tube development, and fertilization. Their involvement in host-pathogen crosstalk as negative regulators of immunity in Arabidopsis has also been recognized. In addition, peptides homologous to RALF are secreted by different fungal pathogens as effectors during early stages of infection. Previous studies have identified nine RALF genes in the diploid strawberry (Fragaria vesca) genome. This work describes the genomic organization of the RALF gene families in commercial octoploid strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) and the re-annotated genome of F. vesca, and then compares findings with orthologs in Arabidopsis thaliana. We reveal the presence of 15 RALF genes in F. vesca genotype Hawaii 4 and 50 in Fragaria x ananassa cv. Camarosa, showing a non-homogenous localization of genes among the different Fragaria x ananassa subgenomes. Expression analysis of Fragaria x ananassa RALF genes upon infection with Colletotrichum acutatum or Botrytis cinerea showed that FanRALF3-1 was the only fruit RALF gene upregulated after fungal infection. In silico analysis was used to identify distinct pathogen inducible elements upstream of the FanRALF3-1 gene. Agroinfiltration of strawberry fruit with deletion constructs of the FanRALF3-1 promoter identified a 5’ region required for FanRALF3-1 expression in fruit, but failed to identify a region responsible for fungal induced expression."
https://openalex.org/W3013270512,"Hippo pathway signaling limits cell growth and proliferation and maintains the stem-cell niche. These cellular events result from the coordinated activity of a core kinase cassette that is regulated, in part, by interactions involving Hippo, Salvador, and dRassF. These interactions are mediated by a conserved coiled-coil domain, termed SARAH, in each of these proteins. SARAH domain–mediated homodimerization of Hippo kinase leads to autophosphorylation and activation. Paradoxically, SARAH domain–mediated heterodimerization between Hippo and Salvador enhances Hippo kinase activity in cells, whereas complex formation with dRassF inhibits it. To better understand the mechanism by which each complex distinctly modulates Hippo kinase and pathway activity, here we biophysically characterized the entire suite of SARAH domain–mediated complexes. We purified the three SARAH domains from Drosophila melanogaster and performed an unbiased pulldown assay to identify all possible interactions, revealing that isolated SARAH domains are sufficient to recapitulate the cellular assemblies and that Hippo is a universal binding partner. Additionally, we found that the Salvador SARAH domain homodimerizes and demonstrate that this interaction is conserved in Salvador's mammalian homolog. Using native MS, we show that each of these complexes is dimeric in solution. We also measured the stability of each SARAH domain complex, finding that despite similarities at both the sequence and structural levels, SARAH domain complexes differ in stability. The identity, stoichiometry, and stability of these interactions characterized here comprehensively reveal the nature of SARAH domain–mediated complex formation and provide mechanistic insights into how SARAH domain–mediated interactions influence Hippo pathway activity.

Hippo signal transduction relies on the activity of a core kinase cassette that includes two kinases, Hippo and Warts, and two accessory proteins, Salvador and Mats. These proteins, together with Yorkie, form a core kinase cassette that is responsible for gene regulation. Each component of this core cassette has a mammalian homolog with similar function. The mechanisms regulating the activity of this kinase cassette are also most likely conserved as disruption of the genes encoding either Hippo (hpo) or Mats (mts) in flies results in overgrowth phenotypes that can be rescued by complementation with the mammalian genes encoding the homologous proteins, Mst1/2 or Mob1, respectively (5Wu S.

The mechanisms by which SARAH domain–mediated complex formation influences Hippo kinase activity are still a matter of investigation.

Use of the etonogestrel Implant (Eng-Implant) is increasing but there are currently no studies evaluating its effect on HIV acquisition risk.Evaluate the potential effect of the Eng-Implant use on HIV acquisition risk by analyzing HIV target cells and cytokine profiles in the lower genital tract and blood of adult premenopausal HIV-negative women using the Eng-Implant.We prospectively obtained paired cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) and blood samples at 4 study visits over 16 weeks from women between ages 18-45, with normal menses (22-35 day intervals), HIV uninfected with no recent hormonal contraceptive or copper intrauterine device (IUD) use, no clinical signs of a sexually transmitted infection at enrollment and who were medically eligible to initiate Eng-Implant. Participants attended pre-Eng-Implant study visits (week -2, week 0) with the Eng-Implant inserted at the end of the week 0 study visit and returned for study visits at weeks 12 and 14. Genital tract leukocytes (enriched from CVL) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the study visits were evaluated for markers of activation (CD38, HLA-DR), retention (CD103) and trafficking (CCR7) on HIV target cells (CCR5+CD4+ T cells) using multicolor flow cytometry. Cytokines and chemokines in the CVL supernatant and blood plasma were measured in a Luminex assay. We estimated and compared study endpoints among the samples collected before and after contraception initiation with repeated-measures analyses using linear mixed models.Fifteen of 18 women who received an Eng-Implant completed all 4 study visits. The percentage of CD4+ T cells in CVL was not increased after implant placement but the percentage of CD4+ T cells expressing the HIV co-receptor CCR5 did increase after implant placement (p = 0.02). In addition, the percentage of central memory CD4+ T-cells (CCR7+) in CVL increased after implant placement (p = 0.004). The percentage of CVL CD4+, CCR5+ HIV target cells expressing activation markers after implant placement was either reduced (HLA-DR+, p = 0.01) or unchanged (CD38+, p = 0.45). Most CVL cytokine and chemokine concentrations were not significantly different after implant placement except for a higher level of the soluble lymphocyte activation marker (sCD40L; p = 0.04) and lower levels of IL12p70 (p = 0.02) and G-CSF (p<0.001). In systemic blood, none of the changes noted in CVL after implant placement occurred except for decreases in the percentage CD4 T-cells expressing HLA-DR+ T cells (p = 0.006) and G-CSF (p = 0.02).Eng-Implant use was associated with a moderate increase in the availability of HIV target cells in the genital tract, however the percentage of these cells that were activated did not increase and there were minimal shifts in the overall immune environment. Given the mixed nature of these findings, it is unclear if these implant-induced changes alter HIV risk."
https://openalex.org/W3013005308,"Biallelic mutations in ACP5, encoding tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP), have recently been identified to cause the inherited immuno-osseous disorder, spondyloenchondrodysplasia (SPENCD). This study was undertaken to characterize the eight reported missense mutations in ACP5 associated with SPENCD on TRACP expression. ACP5 mutant genes were synthesized, transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells and stably expressing cell lines were established. TRACP expression was assessed by cytochemical and immuno-cytochemical staining with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Analysis of wild (WT) type and eight mutant stable cell lines indicated that all mutants lacked stainable enzyme activity. All ACP5 mutant constructs were translated into intact proteins by HEK-293 cells. The mutant TRACP proteins displayed variable immune reactivity patterns, and all drastically reduced enzymatic activity, revealing that there is no gross inhibition of TRACP biosynthesis by the mutations. But they likely interfere with folding thereby impairing enzyme function. TRACP exists as two isoforms. TRACP 5a is a less active monomeric enzyme (35kD), with the intact loop peptide and TRACP 5b is proteolytically cleaved highly active enzyme encompassing two subunits (23 kD and 16 kD) held together by disulfide bonds. None of the mutant proteins were proteolytically processed into isoform 5b intracellularly, and only three mutants were secreted in significant amounts into the culture medium as intact isoform 5a-like proteins. Analysis of antibody reactivity patterns revealed that T89I and M264K mutant proteins retained some native conformation, whereas all others were in “denatured” or “unfolded” forms. Western blot analysis with intracellular and secreted TRACP proteins also revealed similar observations indicating that mutant T89I is amply secreted as inactive protein. All mutant proteins were attacked by Endo-H sensitive glycans and none could be activated by proteolytic cleavage in vitro. In conclusion, determining the structure-function relationship of the SPENCD mutations in TRACP will expand our understanding of basic mechanisms underlying immune responsiveness and its involvement in dysregulated bone metabolism."

In DNA, they can promote replication stress and genomic instability and have been implicated in several diseases. We report here the impact of the ribonucleotide rATP and of its naturally occurring damaged analog 1,N6-ethenoadenosine (1,N6-ϵrA) on translesion synthesis (TLS), mediated by human DNA polymerase η (hpol η), and on RNase H2–mediated incision. Mass spectral analysis revealed that 1,N6-ϵrA in DNA generates extensive frameshifts during TLS, which can lead to genomic instability. Moreover, steady-state kinetic analysis of the TLS process indicated that deoxypurines (i.e. dATP and dGTP) are inserted predominantly opposite 1,N6-ϵrA. We also show that hpol η acts as a reverse transcriptase in the presence of damaged ribonucleotide 1,N6-ϵrA but has poor RNA primer extension activities. Steady-state kinetic analysis of reverse transcription and RNA primer extension showed that hpol η favors the addition of dATP and dGTP opposite 1,N6-ϵrA. We also found that RNase H2 recognizes 1,N6-ϵrA but has limited incision activity across from this lesion, which can lead to the persistence of this detrimental DNA adduct. We conclude that the damaged and unrepaired ribonucleotide 1,N6-ϵrA in DNA exhibits mutagenic potential and can also alter the reading frame in an mRNA transcript because 1,N6-ϵrA is incompletely incised by RNase H2.

We report finding a conserved repeat sequence present in human and chimpanzee genomes that appears to have originated from a common primate ancestor. This sequence is repeatedly copied in human chromosome 22 (chr22) low copy repeats (LCR22) or segmental duplications and forms twenty-one different genes, which include the human long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) family FAM230, a newly discovered lincRNA gene family termed conserved long intergenic non-coding RNAs (clincRNA), pseudogene families, as well as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) protein gene family and the RNA pseudogenes that originate from GGT sequences. Of particular interest are the GGT5 and USP18 protein genes that appear to have formed from an homologous repeat sequence that also forms the clincRNA gene family. The data point to ancestral DNA sequences, conserved through evolution and duplicated in humans by chromosomal repeat sequences that may serve as functional genomic elements in the development of diverse genes."
https://openalex.org/W3013639816,"The intestinal hormone, glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), enhances the enterocyte chylomicron production. However, GLP-2 is known to require the intestinal-epithelial insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IE-IGF-1R) for its other actions to increase intestinal growth and barrier function. The role of the IE-IGF-1R in enterocyte lipid handling was thus tested in the GLP-2 signaling pathway, as well as in response to a Western diet (WD). IE-IGF-1R knockout (KO) and control mice were treated for 11 days with h(GLY2)GLP-2 or fed a WD for 18 weeks followed by a duodenal fat tolerance test with C14-labeled triolein. Human Caco-2BBE cells were treated with an IGF-1R antagonist or signaling inhibitors to determine triglyceride-associated protein expression. The IE-IGF-1R was required for GLP-2-induced increases in CD36 and FATP-4 in chow-fed mice, and for expression in vitro; FATP-4 also required PI3K/Akt. Although WD-fed IE-IGF-1R KO mice demonstrated normal CD36 expression, the protein was incorrectly localized 2h post-duodenal fat administration. IE-IGF-1R KO also prevented the WD-induced increase in MTP and decrease in APOC3, increased jejunal mucosal C14-fat accumulation, and elevated plasma triglyceride and C14-fat levels. Collectively, these studies elucidate new roles for the IE-IGF-1R in enterocyte lipid handling, under basal conditions and in response to GLP-2 and WD-feeding."
https://openalex.org/W3013513893,"There has recently been growing attention and concern in the U.S. on the detrimental drug use and related health conditions impacting diverse sexual minority populations. While some evidence indicates that bisexual women are at increased risk of substance use, little attention has been given to disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority bisexual women, who are particularly vulnerable to a complexity of stressors and risk. Using data from a 15-year longitudinal study in San Antonio, Texas, the current study examines drug use, incarceration histories, stressful life events, and infections among 206 young adult Mexican-American women who report engaging in sex with both men and women (WSWM) (n = 61) and those indicating having exclusively male sex partners (WSM) (n = 145). A bivariate analysis finds that WSWM experienced more frequent (p = 0.001) and longer total time incarcerated (p = 0.001), as well as exposure to more stressful life events (p = 0.003). WSWM also have higher rates of past 30 day injection drug use (p = 0.026) and related Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection (p = 0.001), as well as greater symptomatology associated with depression (p = 0.014), PTSD (p = 0.005), and suicidal ideation (p = 0.036). Findings indicate a significantly elevated risk profile for socio-economically marginalized WSWM. This knowledge is timely and central to policy discourse to develop interventions and health campaigns aimed at reducing and/or preventing further health disparities among this highly susceptible population of minority women."
https://openalex.org/W3013249461,"Eastern tarsiers (Tarsius tarsier complex) are small nocturnal primates endemic to Sulawesi Island and small adjacent islands of Indonesia. In 2004, the hybrid biogeography hypothesis predicted this species complex might contain 16 or more taxa, each corresponding to a region of endemism, based on: 1) geological evidence of the development of the archipelago, 2) biological evidence in the form of concordant distributions of monkeys and toads, and 3) the distribution of tarsier acoustic groups. Since then, 11 tarsier species have been recognized, potentially leaving more to be described. Efforts to identify these cryptic species are urgently needed so that habitat conversion, pet trade, and cultural activities will not render some species extinct before they are recognized. We gathered data to test the hypothesis of cryptic tarsier species on three volcanic islands in Bunaken National Park, North Sulawesi, namely Bunaken, Manadotua, and Mantehage, during May-August 2018. We sequenced individuals at 5 nuclear genes (ABCA1, ADORA3, AXIN1, RAG, and TTR) and made comparisons to existing genotypes at 14 mainland sites. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses revealed that island populations are genetically identical in all 5 genes, and formed a clade separated from the mainland ones. The eastern tarsiers first diverged from the western tarsiers approximately 2.5 MYA. The three island populations diverged from mainland tarsiers approximately 2,000-150,000 YA, due to either human activities or natural rafting. This study provides information for tarsier conservation, advances the understanding of biogeography of Sulawesi, and contributes to Indonesian awareness of biodiversity. Further quantitative genetics research on tarsiers, especially the island populations, will offer significant insights to establish more efficient and strategic tarsier conservation actions."
https://openalex.org/W3013407215,"In age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or diabetic retinopathy (DR), hypoxia and inflammatory processes lead to an upregulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and thereby to pathological neovascularisation with incorrectly formed vessels prone to damage, thus increasing the vascular permeability and the risk of bleeding and oedema in the retina. State of the art treatment is the repeated intraocular injection of anti-VEGF molecules. For developing improved individualized treatment approaches, a minimally invasive, repeatable method for in vivo quantification of VEGF in the eye is necessary. Therefore, we designed single molecule eBRET2 VEGF biosensors by directly fusing a Renilla luciferase mutant (Rluc8) N-terminal and a green fluorescent protein (GFP2) C-terminal to a VEGF binding domain. In total, 10 different VEGF biosensors (Re01- Re10) were generated based on either single domains or full length of VEGF receptor 1 or 2 extracellular regions as VEGF binding domains. Full length expression of the biosensors in HEK293-T cells was verified via Western Blot employing an anti-Rluc8-IgG. Expression of alternative splice variants was eliminated through the deletion of the donor splice site by introduction of a silent point mutation. In all ten biosensors the energy transfer from the Rluc8 to the GFP2 occurs and generates a measurable eBRET2 ratio. Four biosensors show a relevant change of the BRET ratio (ΔBR) after VEGF binding. Furthermore, each biosensor shows a unique detection range for VEGF quantification and especially Re06 and Re07 have a high sensitivity in the range of in vivo VEGF concentrations in the eye, previously measured by invasive methods. In conclusion, we generated several eBRET2 biosensors that are suitable for VEGF quantification in vitro and could identify two eBRET2 biosensors, which may be suitable for non-invasive in vivo VEGF quantification with an implantable device."
https://openalex.org/W3014036990,"Purpose In this paper we compared two different 3D ultrasound (US) modes (3D free-hand mode and 3D wobbler mode) to see which is more suitable to perform the 3D-US/3D-US registration for clinical guidance applications. The typical errors with respect to their impact on the final localization error were evaluated step by step. Methods Multi-point target and Hand-eye calibration methods were used for 3D US calibration together with a newly designed multi-cone phantom. Pointer based and image based methods were used for 2D US calibration. The calibration target error was computed by using a different multi-cone phantom. An egg-shaped phantom was used as ground truth to compare distortions for both 3D modes along with the measurements of the volume. Finally, we compared 3D ultrasound images acquired by 3D wobbler mode and 3D free-hand mode with respect to their 3D-US/3D-US registration accuracy using both, phantom and patient data. A theoretical step by step error analysis was performed and compared to empirical data. Results Target registration errors based on the calibration with the 3D Multi-point and 2D pointer/image method have been found to be comparable (∼1mm). They both outperformed the 3D Hand-eye method (error >2mm). Volume measurements with the 3D free-hand mode were closest to the ground truth (around 6% error compared to 9% with the 3D wobbler mode). Additional scans on phantoms showed a 3D-US/3D-US registration error below 1 mm for both, the 3D free-hand mode and the 3D wobbler mode, respectively. Results with patient data showed greater error with the 3D free-hand mode (6.50mm − 13.37mm) than with the 3D wobbler mode (2.99 ± 1.54 mm). All the measured errors were found to be in accordance to their theoretical upper bounds. Conclusion While both 3D volume methods showed comparable results with respect to 3D-US/3D-US registration for phantom images, for patient data registrations the 3D wobbler mode is superior to the 3D free-hand mode. The effect of all error sources could be estimated by theoretical derivations."
https://openalex.org/W3013014563,"Chart review is an important tool to identify patient hazards. Most advanced medical students perform poorly during chart review but can learn how to identify patient hazards context-independently. Many hospitals have implemented electronic health records, which enhance patient safety but also pose challenges. We investigated whether electronic charts impair advanced medical students’ recognition of patient hazards compared with traditional paper charts. Fifth-year medical students were randomized into two equal groups. Both groups attended a lecture on patient hazards and a training session on handling electronic health records. One group reviewed an electronic chart with 12 standardized patient hazards and then reviewed another case in a paper chart; the other group reviewed the charts in reverse order. The two case scenarios (diabetes and gastrointestinal bleeding) were used as the first and second case equally often. After each case, the students were briefed about the patient safety hazards. In total, 78.5% of the students handed in their notes for evaluation. Two blinded raters independently assessed the number of patient hazards addressed in the students’ notes. For the diabetes case, the students identified a median of 4.0 hazards [25%–75% quantiles (Q25–Q75): 2.0–5.5] in the electronic chart and 5.0 hazards (Q25–Q75: 3.0–6.75) in the paper chart (equivalence testing, p = 0.005). For the gastrointestinal bleeding case, the students identified a median of 5.0 hazards (Q25–Q75: 4.0–6.0) in the electronic chart and 5.0 hazards (Q25–Q75: 3.0–6.0) in the paper chart (equivalence testing, p < 0.001). We detected no improvement between the first case [median 5.0 (Q25–Q75: 3.0–6.0)] and second case [median, 5.0 (Q25–Q75: 3.0–6.0); p < 0.001, test for equivalence]. Electronic charts do not seem to facilitate advanced medical students’ recognition of patient hazards during chart review and may impair expertise formation."
