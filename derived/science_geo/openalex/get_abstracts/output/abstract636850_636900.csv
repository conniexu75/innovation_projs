https://openalex.org/W2963407560,"Soil organisms are a crucial part of the terrestrial biosphere. Despite their importance for ecosystem functioning, few quantitative, spatially explicit models of the active belowground community currently exist. In particular, nematodes are the most abundant animals on Earth, filling all trophic levels in the soil food web. Here we use 6,759 georeferenced samples to generate a mechanistic understanding of the patterns of the global abundance of nematodes in the soil and the composition of their functional groups. The resulting maps show that 4.4 ± 0.64 × 1020 nematodes (with a total biomass of approximately 0.3 gigatonnes) inhabit surface soils across the world, with higher abundances in sub-Arctic regions (38% of total) than in temperate (24%) or tropical (21%) regions. Regional variations in these global trends also provide insights into local patterns of soil fertility and functioning. These high-resolution models provide the first steps towards representing soil ecological processes in global biogeochemical models and will enable the prediction of elemental cycling under current and future climate scenarios. High-resolution spatial maps of the global abundance of soil nematodes and the composition of functional groups show that soil nematodes are found in higher abundances in sub-Arctic regions, than in temperate or tropical regions."
https://openalex.org/W2964069817,"Ferroptosis, a cell death process driven by cellular metabolism and iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has been implicated in diseases such as ischaemic organ damage and cancer1,2. The enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is a central regulator of ferroptosis, and protects cells by neutralizing lipid peroxides, which are by-products of cellular metabolism. The direct inhibition of GPX4, or indirect inhibition by depletion of its substrate glutathione or the building blocks of glutathione (such as cysteine), can trigger ferroptosis3. Ferroptosis contributes to the antitumour function of several tumour suppressors such as p53, BAP1 and fumarase4-7. Counterintuitively, mesenchymal cancer cells-which are prone to metastasis, and often resistant to various treatments-are highly susceptible to ferroptosis8,9. Here we show that ferroptosis can be regulated non-cell-autonomously by cadherin-mediated intercellular interactions. In epithelial cells, such interactions mediated by E-cadherin suppress ferroptosis by activating the intracellular NF2 (also known as merlin) and Hippo signalling pathway. Antagonizing this signalling axis allows the proto-oncogenic transcriptional co-activator YAP to promote ferroptosis by upregulating several ferroptosis modulators, including ACSL4 and TFRC. This finding provides mechanistic insights into the observations that cancer cells with mesenchymal or metastatic property are highly sensitive to ferroptosis8. Notably, a similar mechanism also modulates ferroptosis in some non-epithelial cells. Finally, genetic inactivation of the tumour suppressor NF2, a frequent tumorigenic event in mesothelioma10,11, rendered cancer cells more sensitive to ferroptosis in an orthotopic mouse model of malignant mesothelioma. Our results demonstrate the role of intercellular interactions and intracellular NF2-YAP signalling in dictating ferroptotic death, and also suggest that malignant mutations in NF2-YAP signalling could predict the responsiveness of cancer cells to future ferroptosis-inducing therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2962905556,"Medulloblastoma is a malignant childhood cerebellar tumour type that comprises distinct molecular subgroups. Whereas genomic characteristics of these subgroups are well defined, the extent to which cellular diversity underlies their divergent biology and clinical behaviour remains largely unexplored. Here we used single-cell transcriptomics to investigate intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity in 25 medulloblastomas spanning all molecular subgroups. WNT, SHH and Group 3 tumours comprised subgroup-specific undifferentiated and differentiated neuronal-like malignant populations, whereas Group 4 tumours consisted exclusively of differentiated neuronal-like neoplastic cells. SHH tumours closely resembled granule neurons of varying differentiation states that correlated with patient age. Group 3 and Group 4 tumours exhibited a developmental trajectory from primitive progenitor-like to more mature neuronal-like cells, the relative proportions of which distinguished these subgroups. Cross-species transcriptomics defined distinct glutamatergic populations as putative cells-of-origin for SHH and Group 4 subtypes. Collectively, these data provide insights into the cellular and developmental states underlying subtype-specific medulloblastoma biology."
https://openalex.org/W2963567221,"Organogenesis involves integration of diverse cell types; dysregulation of cell-type-specific gene networks results in birth defects, which affect 5% of live births. Congenital heart defects are the most common malformations, and result from disruption of discrete subsets of cardiac progenitor cells1, but the transcriptional changes in individual progenitors that lead to organ-level defects remain unknown. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to interrogate early cardiac progenitor cells as they become specified during normal and abnormal cardiogenesis, revealing how dysregulation of specific cellular subpopulations has catastrophic consequences. A network-based computational method for single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis that predicts lineage-specifying transcription factors2,3 identified Hand2 as a specifier of outflow tract cells but not right ventricular cells, despite the failure of right ventricular formation in Hand2-null mice4. Temporal single-cell-transcriptome analysis of Hand2-null embryos revealed failure of outflow tract myocardium specification, whereas right ventricular myocardium was specified but failed to properly differentiate and migrate. Loss of Hand2 also led to dysregulation of retinoic acid signalling and disruption of anterior–posterior patterning of cardiac progenitors. This work reveals transcriptional determinants that specify fate and differentiation in individual cardiac progenitor cells, and exposes mechanisms of disrupted cardiac development at single-cell resolution, providing a framework for investigating congenital heart defects. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis reveals functions of lineage-specifying transcription factors underlying congenital defects in heart development."
https://openalex.org/W2963418941,"Allosteric regulation of protein function is widespread in biology, but is challenging for de novo protein design as it requires the explicit design of multiple states with comparable free energies. Here we explore the possibility of designing switchable protein systems de novo, through the modulation of competing inter- and intramolecular interactions. We design a static, five-helix 'cage' with a single interface that can interact either intramolecularly with a terminal 'latch' helix or intermolecularly with a peptide 'key'. Encoded on the latch are functional motifs for binding, degradation or nuclear export that function only when the key displaces the latch from the cage. We describe orthogonal cage-key systems that function in vitro, in yeast and in mammalian cells with up to 40-fold activation of function by key. The ability to design switchable protein functions that are controlled by induced conformational change is a milestone for de novo protein design, and opens up new avenues for synthetic biology and cell engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2963067586,"The mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) is a major transport protein of the inner mitochondrial membrane. It exchanges mitochondrial ATP for cytosolic ADP and controls cellular production of ATP. In addition, it has been proposed that AAC mediates mitochondrial uncoupling, but it has proven difficult to demonstrate this function or to elucidate its mechanisms. Here we record AAC currents directly from inner mitochondrial membranes from various mouse tissues and identify two distinct transport modes: ADP/ATP exchange and H+ transport. The AAC-mediated H+ current requires free fatty acids and resembles the H+ leak via the thermogenic uncoupling protein 1 found in brown fat. The ADP/ATP exchange via AAC negatively regulates the H+ leak, but does not completely inhibit it. This suggests that the H+ leak and mitochondrial uncoupling could be dynamically controlled by cellular ATP demand and the rate of ADP/ATP exchange. By mediating two distinct transport modes, ADP/ATP exchange and H+ leak, AAC connects coupled (ATP production) and uncoupled (thermogenesis) energy conversion in mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2911617575,"The quantum nature of an oscillating mechanical object is anything but apparent. The coherent states that describe the classical motion of a mechanical oscillator do not have a well defined energy, but are quantum superpositions of equally spaced energy eigenstates. Revealing this quantized structure is only possible with an apparatus that measures energy with a precision greater than the energy of a single phonon. One way to achieve this sensitivity is by engineering a strong but nonresonant interaction between the oscillator and an atom. In a system with sufficient quantum coherence, this interaction allows one to distinguish different energy eigenstates using resolvable differences in the atom's transition frequency. For photons, such dispersive measurements have been performed in cavity1,2 and circuit quantum electrodynamics3. Here we report an experiment in which an artificial atom senses the motional energy of a driven nanomechanical oscillator with sufficient sensitivity to resolve the quantization of its energy. To realize this, we build a hybrid platform that integrates nanomechanical piezoelectric resonators with a microwave superconducting qubit on the same chip. We excite phonons with resonant pulses and probe the resulting excitation spectrum of the qubit to observe phonon-number-dependent frequency shifts that are about five times larger than the qubit linewidth. Our result demonstrates a fully integrated platform for quantum acoustics that combines large couplings, considerable coherence times and excellent control over the mechanical mode structure. With modest experimental improvements, we expect that our approach will enable quantum nondemolition measurements of phonons4 and will lead to quantum sensors and information-processing approaches5 that use chip-scale nanomechanical devices."
https://openalex.org/W3099696362,"The circuit model of a quantum computer consists of sequences of gate operations between quantum bits (qubits), drawn from a universal family of discrete operations1. The ability to execute parallel entangling quantum gates offers efficiency gains in numerous quantum circuits2-4, as well as for entire algorithms-such as Shor's factoring algorithm5-and quantum simulations6,7. In circuits such as full adders and multiple-control Toffoli gates, parallelism can provide an exponential improvement in overall execution time through the divide-and-conquer technique8. More importantly, quantum gate parallelism is essential for fault-tolerant error correction of qubits that suffer from idle errors9,10. However, the implementation of parallel quantum gates is complicated by potential crosstalk, especially between qubits that are fully connected by a common-mode bus, such as in Coulomb-coupled trapped atomic ions11,12 or cavity-coupled superconducting transmons13. Here we present experimental results for parallel two-qubit entangling gates in an array of fully connected trapped 171Yb+ ion qubits. We perform a one-bit full-addition operation on a quantum computer using a depth-four quantum circuit4,14,15, where circuit depth denotes the number of runtime steps required. Our method exploits the power of highly connected qubit systems using classical control techniques and will help to speed up quantum circuits and achieve fault tolerance in trapped-ion quantum computers."

https://openalex.org/W2963604054,"Neuromuscular disorders are often caused by heterogeneous mutations in large, structurally complex genes. Targeting compensatory modifier genes could be beneficial to improve disease phenotypes. Here we report a mutation-independent strategy to upregulate the expression of a disease-modifying gene associated with congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A (MDC1A) using the CRISPR activation system in mice. MDC1A is caused by mutations in LAMA2 that lead to nonfunctional laminin-α2, which compromises the stability of muscle fibres and the myelination of peripheral nerves. Transgenic overexpression of Lama1, which encodes a structurally similar protein called laminin-α1, ameliorates muscle wasting and paralysis in mouse models of MDC1A, demonstrating its importance as a compensatory modifier of the disease1. However, postnatal upregulation of Lama1 is hampered by its large size, which exceeds the packaging capacity of vehicles that are clinically relevant for gene therapy. We modulate expression of Lama1 in the dy2j/dy2j mouse model of MDC1A using an adeno-associated virus (AAV9) carrying a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9), VP64 transactivators and single-guide RNAs that target the Lama1 promoter. When pre-symptomatic mice were treated, Lama1 was upregulated in skeletal muscles and peripheral nerves, which prevented muscle fibrosis and paralysis. However, for many disorders it is important to investigate the therapeutic window and reversibility of symptoms. In muscular dystrophies, it has been hypothesized that fibrotic changes in skeletal muscle are irreversible. However, we show that dystrophic features and disease progression were improved and reversed when the treatment was initiated in symptomatic dy2j/dy2j mice with apparent hindlimb paralysis and muscle fibrosis. Collectively, our data demonstrate the feasibility and therapeutic benefit of CRISPR–dCas9-mediated upregulation of Lama1, which may enable mutation-independent treatment for all patients with MDC1A. This approach has a broad applicability to a variety of disease-modifying genes and could serve as a therapeutic strategy for many inherited and acquired diseases. When Lama1 was upregulated using CRISPR and a catalytically inactive Cas9 in a mouse model of congenital muscular dystrophy type 1A, apparent hindlimb paralysis, muscle fibrosis and nerve myelination defects were ameliorated in symptomatic mice."

The upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna2 (LISA) is expected to detect tens of thousands of such systems3 but few have been identified4, of which only one5 is eclipsing-the double-white-dwarf binary SDSS J065133.338+284423.37, which has an orbital period of 12.75 minutes. Here we report the discovery of an eclipsing double-white-dwarf binary system, ZTF J153932.16+502738.8, with an orbital period of 6.91 minutes. This system has an orbit so compact that the entire binary could fit within the diameter of the planet Saturn. The system exhibits a deep eclipse, and a double-lined spectroscopic nature. We see rapid orbital decay, consistent with that expected from general relativity. ZTF J153932.16+502738.8 is a strong source of gravitational radiation close to the peak of LISA's sensitivity, and we expect it to be detected within the first week of LISA observations, once LISA launches in approximately 2034."

https://openalex.org/W3103602560,"Quantum computers can efficiently solve classically intractable problems, such as the factorization of a large number1 and the simulation of quantum many-body systems2,3. Universal quantum computation can be simplified by decomposing circuits into single- and two-qubit entangling gates4, but such decomposition is not necessarily efficient. It has been suggested that polynomial or exponential speedups can be obtained with global N-qubit (N greater than two) entangling gates5-9. Such global gates involve all-to-all connectivity, which emerges among trapped-ion qubits when using laser-driven collective motional modes10-14, and have been implemented for a single motional mode15,16. However, the single-mode approach is difficult to scale up because isolating single modes becomes challenging as the number of ions increases in a single crystal, and multi-mode schemes are scalable17,18 but limited to pairwise gates19-23. Here we propose and implement a scalable scheme for realizing global entangling gates on multiple 171Yb+ ion qubits by coupling to multiple motional modes through modulated laser fields. Because such global gates require decoupling multiple modes and balancing all pairwise coupling strengths during the gate, we develop a system with fully independent control capability on each ion14. To demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of these global gates, we generate a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state with up to four qubits using a single global operation. Our approach realizes global entangling gates as scalable building blocks for universal quantum computation, motivating future research in scalable global methods for quantum information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2963898471,"Purpose We introduce two validated single (SH) and dual hormone (DH) mathematical models that represent an in-silico virtual patient population (VPP) for type 1 diabetes (T1D). The VPP can be used to evaluate automated insulin and glucagon delivery algorithms, so-called artificial pancreas (AP) algorithms that are currently being used to help people with T1D better manage their glucose levels. We present validation results comparing these virtual patients with true clinical patients undergoing AP control and demonstrate that the virtual patients behave similarly to people with T1D. Methods A single hormone virtual patient population (SH-VPP) was created that is comprised of eight differential equations that describe insulin kinetics, insulin dynamics and carbohydrate absorption. The parameters in this model that represent insulin sensitivity were statistically sampled from a normal distribution to create a population of virtual patients with different levels of insulin sensitivity. A dual hormone virtual patient population (DH-VPP) extended this SH-VPP by incorporating additional equations to represent glucagon kinetics and glucagon dynamics. The DH-VPP is comprised of thirteen differential equations and a parameter representing glucagon sensitivity, which was statistically sampled from a normal distribution to create virtual patients with different levels of glucagon sensitivity. We evaluated the SH-VPP and DH-VPP on a clinical data set of 20 people with T1D who participated in a 3.5-day outpatient AP study. Twenty virtual patients were matched with the 20 clinical patients by total daily insulin requirements and body weight. The identical meals given during the AP study were given to the virtual patients and the identical AP control algorithm that was used to control the glucose of the virtual patients was used on the clinical patients. We compared percent time in target range (70–180 mg/dL), time in hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) and time in hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dL) for both the virtual patients and the actual patients. Results The subjects in the SH-VPP performed similarly vs. the actual patients (time in range: 78.1 ± 5.1% vs. 74.3 ± 8.1%, p = 0.11; time in hypoglycemia: 3.4 ± 1.3% vs. 2.8 ± 1.7%, p = 0.23). The subjects in the DH-VPP also performed similarly vs. the actual patients (time in range: 75.6 ± 5.5% vs. 71.9 ± 10.9%, p = 0.13; time in hypoglycemia: 0.9 ± 0.8% vs. 1.3 ± 1%, p = 0.19). While the VPPs tended to over-estimate the time in range relative to actual patients, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions We have verified that a SH-VPP and a DH-VPP performed comparably with actual patients undergoing AP control using an identical control algorithm. The SH-VPP and DH-VPP may be used as a simulator for pre-evaluation of T1D control algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2963429401,"Myeloperoxidase is a major neutrophil antimicrobial protein, but its role in immunity is often overlooked because individuals deficient in this enzyme are usually in good health. Within neutrophil phagosomes, myeloperoxidase uses superoxide generated by the NADPH oxidase to oxidize chloride to the potent bactericidal oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl). In this study, using phagocytosis assays and LC-MS analyses, we monitored GSH oxidation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa to gauge their exposure to HOCl inside phagosomes. Doses of reagent HOCl that killed most of the bacteria oxidized half the cells' GSH, producing mainly glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and other low-molecular-weight disulfides. Glutathione sulfonamide (GSA), a HOCl-specific product, was also formed. When neutrophils phagocytosed P. aeruginosa, half of the bacterial GSH was lost. Bacterial GSA production indicated that HOCl had reacted with the bacterial cells, oxidized their GSH, and was sufficient to be solely responsible for bacterial killing. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase lowered GSA formation in the bacterial cells, but the bacteria were still killed, presumably by compensatory nonoxidative mechanisms. Of note, bacterial GSA formation in neutrophils from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) was normal during early phagocytosis, but it was diminished at later time points, which was mirrored by a small decrease in bacterial killing. In conclusion, myeloperoxidase generates sufficient HOCl within neutrophil phagosomes to kill ingested bacteria. The unusual kinetics of phagosomal HOCl production in CF neutrophils confirm a role for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in maintaining HOCl production in neutrophil phagosomes."
https://openalex.org/W3105658486,"Although the possibility of spatial variations in the superfluid of unconventional, strongly correlated superconductors has been suggested1-7, it is not known whether such inhomogeneities-if they exist-are driven by disorder, strong scattering or other factors. Here we use atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunnelling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. By simultaneously measuring the topographic and electronic properties of the superconductor, we find that this inhomogeneity in the superfluid is not caused by structural disorder or strong inter-pocket scattering and is not correlated with variations in the energy required to break electron pairs. Instead, we see a clear spatial correlation between the superfluid density and the quasiparticle strength (the height of the coherence peak) on a local scale. This result places iron-based superconductors on equal footing with copper oxide superconductors, where a similar relation has been observed on the macroscopic scale. Our results establish the existence of strongly inhomogeneous superfluids in unconventional superconductors, excluding chemical disorder and inter-band scattering as the causes of the inhomogeneity, and shed light on the relation between quasiparticle character and superfluid density. When repeated at different temperatures, our technique could further help to elucidate what local and global mechanisms limit the critical temperature in unconventional superconductors."

Recently, numerous microRNA (miRNA) have been described to regulate EMT in tumor progression. In this study, we found that conditioned medium from the LC212 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line (LC212-CM) induces morphological changes and overexpression of Vimentin, CD90, SMAD 2/3, SLUG and TWIST in A549 NSCLC cells, consistent with a mesenchymal phenotype. To identify the soluble mediators in LC212-CM involved in this phenomenon, we performed miRNA profiling and TGF-β1 quantification. We found that LC212-CM contains high levels of TGF-β1 as well as different secreted miRNAs. We focused our attention on Homo sapiens-microRNA21 (hsa-miR21), one of most relevant miRNA associated with lung cancer progression, metastasis and EMT. An hsa-miR21 antagomiR was able to prevent the LC212-CM-induced EMT phenotype in A549 cells. Furthermore, we found that TGF-β1 and hsa-miR21 cooperate in the induction of EMT in A549 cells. Intriguingly, TGF-β1 was found to induce hsa-miR21 expression in A549 cell, thus suggesting that the hsa-miR21 mediates at least in part the pro-EMT effects of TGF-β1. In conclusion, hsa-miR21 and TGF-β1 are involved in autocrine and paracrine circuits that regulate the EMT status of lung cancer cells."

Candida sp. produces volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that stimulate Zygosacchromyces sp. development. Monascus ruber inhibits Zygosacchromyces sp. growth by producing lovastatin, which blocks steroid biosynthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2963059612,"RAS regulation and signaling are largely accomplished by direct protein-protein interactions, making RAS protein dynamics a critical determinant of RAS function. Here, we report a crystal structure of GDP-bound KRASV14I, a mutated KRAS variant associated with the developmental RASopathy disorder Noonan syndrome (NS), at 1.5-1.6 Å resolution. The structure is notable for revealing a marked extension of switch 1 away from the G-domain and nucleotide-binding site of the KRAS protein. We found that this extension is associated with a loss of the magnesium ion and a tilt in the position of the guanine base because of the additional carbon introduced by the isoleucine substitution. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS analysis confirmed that this conformation occurs in solution, but also disclosed a difference in kinetics when compared with KRASA146T, another RAS mutant that displays a nearly identical conformation in previously reported crystal structures. This conformational change contributed to a high rate of guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF)-dependent and -independent nucleotide exchange and to an increase in affinity for SOS Ras/Rac GEF 1 (SOS1), which appears to be the major mode of activation for this RAS variant. These results highlight a mechanistic connection between KRASA146T and KRASV14I that may have implications for the regulation of these variants and for the development of therapeutic strategies to manage KRAS variant-associated disorders."

The results showed that CTC numbers in stage IV cases were significantly higher than those in stage I, II or III cases. The number of CTCs in poorly-differentiated cases was significantly higher than that in well-differentiated cases. During six chemotherapy cycles, the average CTC number decreased from 5.8/7.5 ml in cycle #1 to 2.4/7.5 ml in cycle #4 and remained at almost the same level from 4 to 6 cycles. CTC numbers in patients with EGFR mutations was significantly higher than those in patients with no mutations. The average progression free survival (PFS) in the favorable group (CTC ≤ 5/7.5 ml) was 11.3 months, which was longer than that in the unfavorable group (CTC > 5/7.5 ml, 7.2 months). In conclusion, the assessment of NSCLC cannot be performed using a single CTC analysis. The clinical value is more significant in the continuous analysis of CTC data, as well as the cross-validation of other indexes and imaging results."

Genes encoding most members of the MttB superfamily lack the codon for pyrrolysine that distinguishes previously characterized trimethylamine methyltransferases, leaving the function(s) of most of the enzymes in this superfamily unknown. Here, investigating the MttB family member MtpB from the human intestinal isolate Eubacterium limosum ATCC 8486, an acetogen that excretes N-methyl proline during growth on proline betaine, we demonstrate that MtpB catalyzes anoxic demethylation of proline betaine. MtpB along with MtqC (a corrinoid protein) and MtqA (a methylcorrinoid:tetrahydrofolate methyltransferase) was much more abundant in E. limosum cells grown on proline betaine than on lactate. We observed that recombinant MtpB methylates Co(I)-MtqC in the presence of proline betaine and that other quaternary amines are much less preferred substrates. MtpB, MtqC, and MtqA catalyze tetrahydrofolate methylation with proline betaine, thereby forming a key intermediate in the Wood–Ljungdahl acetogenesis pathway. To our knowledge, MtpB methylation of Co(I)-MtqC for the subsequent methylation of tetrahydrofolate represents the first described anoxic mechanism of proline betaine demethylation. The activities of MtpB and associated proteins in acetogens or other anaerobes provide a possible mechanism for the production of N-methyl proline by the gut microbiome.

https://openalex.org/W2963285505,"Skin conductance response (SCR) is used in psychophysiological research to measure the reactions of the autonomic nervous system to reward and punishment. While there is consistent evidence that SCR increases to both aversive and appetitive stimuli, it remains unclear whether SCR simply represents a general index of arousal to motivationally significant outcomes or may also differentiate action or inhibition of action that lead to such outcomes. Furthermore, individual differences in trait sensitivity to reward and punishment can influence physiological arousal during approach and avoidance behaviors. Yet, their inter-relationships have not been examined. To address these gaps, we employed a reward go/no-go task with ⅔ go and ⅓ no-go trials and an individually titrated go response window. Correct go and no-go responses were rewarded while incorrect responses were penalized. We examined whether SCR varied with outcome (win vs. loss), action (go vs. no-go), and individual differences in reward sensitivity (SR) and sex. The results showed greater SCRs to loss vs. win, to go vs. no-go success, and to go success in positive correlation with SR. Further, SCR mediated the relationship between SR and go success rate. In sex differences, men exhibited greater SCR which was more predictive of go success rate relative to women. In contrast, SCR was more predictive of no-go success rate in women. Thus, SCR varies according to behavioral contingency, outcome, sex, and reward sensitivity. These findings add to the literature by characterizing the individual and behavioral factors that may influence physiological arousal in response to salient events."
https://openalex.org/W2963711666,"The homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (HIPK) family is comprised of four nuclear protein kinases, HIPK1-4. HIPK proteins phosphorylate a diverse range of transcription factors involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. HIPK2, thus far the best-characterized member of this largely understudied family of protein kinases, plays a role in the activation of p53 in response to DNA damage. Despite this tumor-suppressor function, HIPK2 is also found overexpressed in several cancers, and its hyperactivation causes chronic fibrosis. There are currently no structures of HIPK2 or of any other HIPK kinase. Here, we report the crystal structure of HIPK2's kinase domain bound to CX-4945, a casein kinase 2α (CK2α) inhibitor currently in clinical trials against several cancers. The structure, determined at 2.2 Å resolution, revealed that CX-4945 engages the HIPK2 active site in a hybrid binding mode between that seen in structures of CK2α and Pim1 kinases. The HIPK2 kinase domain crystallized in the active conformation, which was stabilized by phosphorylation of the activation loop. We noted that the overall kinase domain fold of HIPK2 closely resembles that of evolutionarily related dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinases (DYRKs). Most significant structural differences between HIPK2 and DYRKs included an absence of the regulatory N-terminal domain and a unique conformation of the CMGC-insert region and of a newly defined insert segment in the αC-β4 loop. This first crystal structure of HIPK2 paves the way for characterizing the understudied members of the HIPK family and for developing HIPK2-directed therapies for managing cancer and fibrosis."

However, the mechanisms through which endothelial cells transduce mechanical signals to cellular responses remain poorly understood. In this report, using tensile-force assays, immunofluorescence and atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that immunoglobulin and proline-rich receptor-1 (IGPR-1) responds to mechanical stimulation and increases the stiffness of endothelial cells. We observed that IGPR-1 is activated by shear stress and tensile force and that flow shear stress–mediated IGPR-1 activation modulates remodeling of endothelial cells.

Endothelial cells shelter the internal surface of blood vessels, maintain vascular and tissue homeostasis, and modulate many key physiological processes, including angiogenesis, immune responses, and dynamic fluid exchanges throughout organs. Homeostasis of endothelial cells necessitates the assimilation of various signals from sites of adhesion to extracellular matrix components and adjacent cells, signals from circulating soluble factors, as well as mechanical stimuli (1Cavallaro U. Dejana E. Adhesion molecule signalling: not always a sticky business.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12 (21346732): 189-19710.1038/nrm3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).

In addition, IGPR-1 supports the growth of colon cancer cell lines by promoting multicellular aggregation in the absence of adhesion to substratum (9Woolf N. Pearson B.E. Bondzie P.A. Meyer R.D.

IGPR-1 transmits intracellular information in part by interacting with several Src homology 3 domain containing proteins such Src homology 3 protein interacting with Nck90 (SPIN90, also called WISH/NCKIPSD) (8Rahimi N.

Inhibition of transhomophilic dimerization of IGPR-1 by deletion of the extracellular domain or by a blocking antibody impairs its ability to regulate endothelial barrier function (10Wang Y.H.W.

IGPR-1 localizes to endothelial adherent junctions, and its activation via transhomophilic dimerization stimulates phosphorylation of Ser-220 (10Wang Y.H.W. Meyer R.D. Bondzie P.A. Jiang Y. Rahimi I.

In this study, we report that IGPR-1 functions as a mechanosensitive receptor that is activated by shear stress and plays a critical role in endothelial cell response to flow shear stress. In response to various physical and chemical stimuli, endothelial cells undergo morphological remodeling and cytoskeletal actin stress fiber rearrangements (11Galbraith C.G. Skalak R. Chien S. Shear stress induces spatial reorganization of the endothelial cell cytoskeleton.Cell Motil Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40 (9712262): 317-33010.1002/(SICI)1097-0169(1998)40:4%3C317::AID-CM1%3E3.0.CO;2-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 12Malek A.M.

This cross-linking of vinculin with actin filaments is a critical step for formation of focal adhesions and also in capping actin filaments to regulate actin dynamics (13Mierke C.T. The role of vinculin in the regulation of the mechanical properties of cells.Cell Biochem.

Our recent work indicated that IGPR-1 is present at the endothelial adherens junctions and potentially plays a role in angiogenesis and stabilization of vessels (8Rahimi N. Rezazadeh K. Mahoney J.E. Hartsough E. Meyer R.D. Identification of IGPR-1 as a novel adhesion molecule involved in angiogenesis.Mol. Biol.

To assess the role of IGPR-1 in endothelial cell adherens junction, we stained porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells expressing empty vector (EV) or IGPR-1 for ZO1 (zonula occluden 1). ZO1 is a scaffolding protein that links transmembrane proteins at the cell junction to the actin cytoskeleton, which is also required for endothelial adherens junction and barrier function (15Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. The tight junction protein ZO-1 establishes a link between the transmembrane protein occludin and the actin cytoskeleton.J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2015; 208 (25753039): 821-83810.1083/jcb.201404140Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). IGPR-1 increased stability of endothelial cell adherens junctions as determined by immunostaining of PAE cells with ZO1 (Fig. 1A). Staining of IGPR-1/PAE cells with anti–IGPR-1 antibody showed that IGPR-1 was preferentially localized at the periphery of the endothelial cell–cell contacts (Fig. 1B). Ectopic expression of IGPR-1 in PAE cells also was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). Next, we asked whether silencing IGPR-1 in human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs) affects adherens junctions. Knockdown of IGPR-1 in HUVECs by shRNA considerably decreased adherens junctions (Fig. 1D). The knockdown of IGPR-1 by shRNA in HUVECs is shown (Fig. 1E). Re-expressing IGPR-1 in these cells rescued stability of adherens junctions as determined by staining of cells with ZO1 (Fig. S1B). IGPR-1 expression in PAE cells also markedly increased actin stress fiber networks and stimulated cross-linking of vinculin with actin filaments (Fig. 1F). Taken together, the data indicate that IGPR-1 increases tight junction formation as determined by ZO1 staining and actin architecture reorganization into stress fiber arrays as determined by phalloidin staining. Given that the stability of cell–cell junctions and actin stress fiber dynamics are modulated by cell spreading and adhesion (17Schwarz U.S. Gardel M.L. United we stand: integrating the actin cytoskeleton and cell-matrix adhesions in cellular mechanotransduction.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125 (22797913): 3051-306010.1242/jcs.093716Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), we examined the role of cell spreading and cell–cell contact in the activation of IGPR-1. To test the role of cell spreading in activation of IGPR-1, IGPR-1/PAE cells were seeded and allowed to adhere for various time points (1–4 h), and activation of IGPR-1 was determined by Western blotting using a previously validated pSer-220 antibody (10Wang Y.H.W. Meyer R.D. Bondzie P.A. Jiang Y. Rahimi I. Rezazadeh K. Mehta M. Laver N.M.V. Costello C.E. Rahimi N. IGPR-1 is required for endothelial cell–cell adhesion and barrier function.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428 (27838321): 5019-503310.1016/j.jmb.2016.11.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Within 1 h, as cells began to adhere and spread (Fig. 2A), phosphorylation of IGPR-1 at Ser-220 was significantly increased and remained phosphorylated for up to 4 h as cells became fully adhered (Fig. 2B). However, IGPR-1 was not phosphorylated when cells were seeded on the low attachment plates (i.e. suspension), which prevents cell spreading (Fig. 2C), indicating that cell spreading is required for IGPR-1 activation. To demonstrate the role of cell density in IGPR-1 activation, the cells were plated in a sparse (40–50% confluent) condition, which reached full confluency at days 3 and 4. Phosphorylation of IGPR-1 in normalized whole-cell lysates was assessed by Western blotting analysis. The basal level of Ser-220 phosphorylation was determined at days 1 and 2 (Fig. 2D). As confluency of cells increased, phosphorylation of IGPR-1 was also significantly augmented (1.3-fold at day 2, 3.9-fold at day 3, and 5.2-fold at day 4) (Fig. 2D). The cell density–dependent phosphorylation of IGPR-1 was inhibited when IGPR-1/PAE cells were mixed (1:1 ratio) with PAE cells expressing empty vector (EV/PAE) (Fig. S2A), indicating that cell density–dependent IGPR-1 phosphorylation is associated with its transdimerization. In support of this possibility, incubation of IGPR-1/PAE cells with a blocking antibody (1A12) inhibited cell density–dependent phosphorylation of IGPR-1 (Fig. S1B). Considering that IGPR-1 phosphorylation at Ser-220 is regulated by cell adhesion (Fig. 2B) and along with our previous observation that AKT phosphorylates IGPR-1 at Ser-220 in colon cancer cell line HCT116 (9Woolf N. Pearson B.E. Bondzie P.A. Meyer R.D. Lavaei M. Belkina A.C. Chitalia V. Rahimi N. Targeting tumor multicellular aggregation through IGPR-1 inhibits colon cancer growth and improves chemotherapy.Oncogenesis. 2017; 6 (28920928): e37810.1038/oncsis.2017.77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we asked whether AKT is activated in a cell adhesion–dependent manner in PAE cells. We found AKT was phosphorylated in PAE cells in a cell adhesion–dependent manner (Fig. 3A), suggesting a possible link between activation of AKT and phosphorylation of IGPR-1 at Ser-220. In that regard, we examined the role of AKT in the phosphorylation of IGPR-1 in endothelial cells. For this, we asked whether overexpression of a dominant-negative AKT1 (K179M/T308A/S473A) can inhibit IGPR-1 phosphorylation. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that expression of K179M/T308A/S473A-AKT inhibited Ser-220 phosphorylation of IGPR-1 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, treatment of IGPR-1/PAE cells and HUVECs endogenously expressing IGPR-1 with an AKT inhibitor, GSK-690693 (4 nm, 60 min), also effectively inhibited phosphorylation of IGPR-1 at Ser-220 (Fig. 3, C and D). Taken together, our data demonstrate that AKT mediates phosphorylation IGPR-1 at Ser-220. Previous studies have shown that in response to fluid flow, endothelial cells align along the direction of fluid flow (19Steward Jr, R. Tambe D. Hardin C.C. Krishnan R. Fredberg J.J. Fluid shear, intercellular stress, and endothelial cell alignment.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2015; 308 (25652451): C657-C66410.1152/ajpcell.00363.2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We asked whether shear stress modulates localization of IGPR-1 in endothelial cells. In static conditions, IGPR-1 was localized indiscriminately at the cell–cell contact regions. However, under shear stress, IGPR-1 was distributed laterally along the direction of flow (Fig. 4A). Another known response to shear stress is the remolding of the actin cytoskeleton, which produces various cellular responses and activates several major signaling proteins (20Chowdhury F. Na S. Li D. Poh Y.C. Tanaka T.S. Wang F. Wang N. Material properties of the cell dictate stress-induced spreading and differentiation in embryonic stem cells.Nat.

We asked whether IGPR-1 mediates changes in the actin cortex network and cell realignment induced by flow shear stress. Under flow shear stress, IGPR-1/PAE cells exhibited extensive and robust actin cortex network along the direction of flow shear stress, with ring-like F-actin structures compared with normal static conditions (Fig. 4B). However, actin cortex networks in the control PAE (EV/PAE) cells under identical flow shear stress conditions were concentrated mainly at the periphery of the cells (Fig. 4D). We also quantified F-actin orientation (i.e. anisotropy) and F-actin expression (i.e. mean fluorescence intensity) using an open source plugin for ImageJ, Fibriltool software (22Boudaoud A. Burian A. Borowska-Wykret D. Uyttewaal M. Wrzalik R. Kwiatkowska D. Hamant O. FibrilTool, an ImageJ plug-in to quantify fibrillar structures in raw microscopy images.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 (24481272): 457-46310.1038/nprot.2014.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), which shows a significant increase in both actin fluorescence intensity and orientation in IGPR-1/PAE cells (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Actin fluorescence intensity and orientation under shear stress did not significantly change in PAE cells expressing empty vector (Fig. 4D). As noted, IGPR-1/PAE cells also underwent a significant realignment in response to flow compared with control PAE cells expressing empty vector, EV/PAE (Fig. 4, C and E). The data demonstrate that IGPR-1 modulates endothelial cells' response to shear stress. Blood vessels are subject to shear stress caused by blood flow and are able to respond to changes in flow by translating mechanical stimuli into intracellular signals (23Davies P.F. Flow-mediated endothelial mechanotransduction.Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75 (7624393): 519-56010.1152/physrev.1995.75.3.519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). IGPR-1 is expressed in both arterial and venous endothelial cells (Fig. S3, A and B), and considering its role in endothelial cells' response to shear stress (Fig. 4B), we examined whether IGPR-1 is activated by shear stress. We subjected HUVECs to shear stress and measured phosphorylation of IGPR-1 at Ser-220. Phosphorylation of IGPR-1 increased by nearly 4-fold in response to shear stress (Fig. 5A). Similarly, phosphorylation of IGPR-1 in IGPR-1/PAE cells subjected to flow shear stress was strongly increased within 30 min and remained phosphorylated at 60 min (Fig. 5B). Phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase (6Tzima E. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Dejana E. Schultz D.A. Engelhardt B. Cao G. DeLisser H.

Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Fluid shear stress stimulates phosphorylation of Akt in human endothelial cells: involvement in suppression of apoptosis.Circ.

Consistent with the previous observations, flow shear stress induced AKT1 activation (Fig. S4A). Additionally, expression of IGPR-1 in PAE cells, increased phosphorylation of AKT1 (Fig. S4A), and co-expression of a dominant-negative AKT1 with IGPR-1 inhibited shear stress– and IGPR-1–dependent phosphorylation of AKT1 (Fig. S4A). To address the flow shear stress–induced activation of AKT1 in IGPR-1 phosphorylation, we measured IGPR-1 phosphorylation in PAE cells treated with the AKT inhibitor GSK-690693 under shear stress. GSK-690693 inhibited shear stress–induced phosphorylation of IGPR-1 (Fig. 5C). Moreover, co-expression of dominant-negative AKT1 with IGPR-1 also inhibited shear stress–induced phosphorylation of IGPR-1 at Ser-220 (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, co-expression of the dominant-negative AKT1 with IGPR-1 considerably inhibited the flow shear stress–induced actin stress fiber rearrangement and cell realignment of PAE cells (Fig. 5E). To investigate whether Ser-220 phosphorylation of IGPR-1 is important for actin stress fiber network assembly and realignment of endothelial cells in response to shear stress, we generated PAE cells expressing A220/IGPR-1 (A220–IGPR-1/PAE, whereby serine at 220 is mutated to alanine) and retrovirally expressed in PAE cells. Ser-220 mutation abrogated IGPR-1–dependent actin stress fiber rearrangement in response to shear stress (Fig. S5B). The data demonstrated that shear stress–induced phosphorylation of IGPR-1 at Ser-220 is required for actin stress fiber rearrangement in response to shear stress. Cell adhesion molecules, such as integrins, respond to mechanical cues such as stiffness of extracellular matrix (ECM) or forces generated from cell–cell interaction through cadherins and immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules. We used tensile force (26Marjoram R.J. Guilluy C. Burridge K. Using magnets and magnetic beads to dissect signaling pathways activated by mechanical tension applied to cells.Methods. 2016; 94 (26427549): 19-2610.1016/j.ymeth.2015.09.025Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (27Eyckmans J. Boudou T. Yu X. Chen C.S. A hitchhiker's guide to mechanobiology.Dev.

The application of tensile force to IGPR-1 using magnetic beads was performed as previously described (28Bays J.L. Peng X. Tolbert C.E. Guilluy C. Angell A.E. Pan Y. Superfine R. Burridge K. DeMali K.A. Vinculin phosphorylation differentially regulates mechanotransduction at cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesions.J.

For this, PAE cells expressing IGPR-1 were incubated with magnetic beads and coated with a mAb directed against the extracellular domain of IGPR-1 or mouse IgG as a control (Fig. 6A), and a constant force was applied for 15 min using a magnet. Following application of force, the cells were lysed, and whole-cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting analysis. Application of force selectively increased phosphorylation of IGPR-1 at Ser-220 (Fig. 6B) but not in cells incubated with control mouse IgG (Fig. 6B). As an additional measure, we used AFM to examine the mechanosensing potential of IGPR-1. AFM is commonly used in various systems to study mechanotransduction (29Heinisch J.J. Lipke P.N. Beaussart A. El Kirat Chatel S. Dupres V. Alsteens D. Dufrêne Y.F. Atomic force microscopy: looking at mechanosensors on the cell surface.J.

Fig. 6C shows representative indentation curves obtained from EV/PAE, IGPR-1/PAE, and A220–IGPR-1/PAE cells. To obtain the elastic modulus (i.e. the ratio of the force exerted on the membrane of PAE cells that results in deformation) of the cell membrane, the Hertz's model for nonadhesive elastic contact was used to correlate the loading force with indentation depth within the initial contact regime, spanning 0–25 pN force and up to 50 nm indentation depth (corresponding to ∼10% of the total contact). The elastic moduli obtained from different locations across the cell lines was plotted in the histograms (Fig. S6, A and B), and the statistics were determined (Fig. 6D and Table S1). These values are within the ranges of elastic moduli reported for other endothelial cells (30Schaefer A. Hordijk P.L. Cell-stiffness-induced mechanosignaling: a key driver of leukocyte transendothelial migration.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128 (26092932): 2221-223010.1242/jcs.163055Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There was a significant difference between the stiffness of IGPR-1/PAE and EV/PAE cells (*, p < 0.0001) and between IGPR-1/PAE and A220–IGPR-1/PAE cells (**, p = 0.0005) (Fig. 6D). However, PAE cells expressing Ser-220 mutant IGPR-1 (A220–IGPR-1/PAE) showed lower stiffness. There was no statistically significant difference between the stiffness of EV/PAE and A220–IGPR-1/PAE cells (p = 0.035). The data suggest that phosphorylation of IGPR-1 likely through stimulation of stress fiber formation causes cells to become stiffer as measured by AFM. In this study, we demonstrated that IGPR-1 is activated by cell adhesion and shear stress, suggesting a mechanosensing function for this receptor in endothelial cells. The main function of blood vessels is to transport pressurized blood to tissues in the body, a process that exerts fluid shear stress on the endothelial cells (31Paszkowiak J.J. Dardik A. Arterial wall shear stress: observations from the bench to the bedside.Vasc.

Endothelial cells respond to and transduce the fluid shear stress from blood flow to biochemical signals that regulate endothelial cell morphology and gene expression through various mechanisms and pathways (31Paszkowiak J.J. Dardik A. Arterial wall shear stress: observations from the bench to the bedside.Vasc.

https://openalex.org/W2962779562,"Induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) have the potential to transform regenerative cardiac medicine and the modelling of cardiac disease. This is of particular importance in the context of diabetic cardiomyopathy where diabetic individuals exhibit reduced cardiac diastolic contractile performance in the absence of vascular disease, significantly contributing towards high cardiovascular morbidity. In this study, the capacity of iPSC-CM to act as a novel cellular model of cardiomyocytes was assessed. The diabetic phenotype is characterised by insulin resistance, therefore there was a specific focus upon metabolic parameters. Despite expressing crucial insulin signalling intermediates and relevant trafficking proteins, it was identified that iPSC-CM do not exhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. iPSC-CM are spontaneously contractile however contraction mediated uptake was not found to mask any insulin response. The fundamental limitation identified in these cells was a critical lack of expression of the insulin sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4. Using comparative immunoblot analysis and the GLUT-selective inhibitor BAY-876 to quantify expression of these transporters, we show that iPSC-CM express high levels of GLUT1 and low levels of GLUT4 compared to primary cardiomyocytes and cultured adipocytes. Interventions to overcome this limitation were unsuccessful. We suggest that the utility of iPSC-CMs to study cardiac metabolic disorders may be limited by their apparent foetal-like phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2963964319,"The human retina contains three classes of cone photoreceptors each sensitive to different portions of the visual spectrum: long (L), medium (M) and short (S) wavelengths. Color information is computed by downstream neurons that compare relative activity across the three cone types. How cone signals are combined at a cellular scale has been more difficult to resolve. This is especially true near the fovea, where spectrally-opponent neurons in the parvocellular pathway draw excitatory input from a single cone and thus even the smallest stimulus projected through natural optics will engage multiple color-signaling neurons. We used an adaptive optics microstimulator to target individual and pairs of cones with light. Consistent with prior work, we found that color percepts elicited from individual cones were predicted by their spectral sensitivity, although there was considerable variability even between cones within the same spectral class. The appearance of spots targeted at two cones were predicted by an average of their individual activations. However, two cones of the same subclass elicited percepts that were systematically more saturated than predicted by an average. Together, these observations suggest both spectral opponency and prior experience influence the appearance of small spots."

https://openalex.org/W2964099112,"Background In the Philippines, one in four pregnancies are unintended and 610 000 unsafe abortions are performed each year. This study explored the association between missed opportunities to provide family planning counseling, quality of counseling and its impact on utilization of effective contraception in the Philippines. Methods One-hundred-one nationally representative health facilities were randomly selected from five levels of the health system. Sexually-active women 18–49 years old, wanting to delay or limit childbearing, attending primary care clinics between April 24 and August 8, 2017 were included. Data on contraceptive use, counseling and availability were collected using interviews and facility assessments. Effective contraceptive methods were defined as those with rates of unintended pregnancy of less than 10 per 100 women in first year of typical use. Findings 849 women were recruited of whom 51.1% currently used effective contraceptive methods, 20.6% were former effective method users and 28.3% had never used an effective method. Of 1664 cumulative clinic visits reported by women in the previous year, 72.6% had a missed opportunity to receive family planning counseling at any visit regardless of level of facility, with 83.7% having a missed counseling opportunity on the day of the interview. Most women (55.9%) reported health concerns about modern contraception, with 2.9% receiving counseling addressing their concerns. Only 0.6% of former users and 2.1% never-users said they would consider starting a modern contraceptive in the future. Short and long acting reversible contraceptive methods were available in 93% and 68% of facilities respectively. Conclusions Missed opportunities to provide family planning counseling are widespread in the Philippines. Delivery of effective contraceptive methods requires that wider legal, policy, social, cultural, and structural barriers are addressed, coupled with systems approaches for improving availability and quality of counseling at all primary health care contacts."

Using three of the ten districts in Greater Manchester (UK) as a case-study, we present a landscape approach to mapping green infrastructure and variation in social-ecological-environmental conditions as a function of land sharing and sparing. We do so for the landscape as a whole and in a more focussed approach for areas of high and low urbanity. Results imply potential trade-offs between land-sharing-sparing scenarios relevant to characteristics critical to urban resilience such as landscape connectivity and diversity, air quality, surface temperature, and access to green space. These trade-offs are complex due to the parallel influence of patch attributes such as land-cover and size and imply that both ecological restoration and spatial planning have a role to play in reconciling tensions between land-sharing and sparing strategies."

Thioflavin T fluorescence assays and atomic force microscopy revealed that elimination of residues 14–22 completely inhibits fibril formation of apoA-I 1–83/G26R, whereas Δ32–40 and Δ50–58 variants formed fibrils with markedly reduced nucleation and fibril growth rates. CD measurements revealed structural transitions from random coil to β-sheet structures in all deletion variants except for the Δ14–22 variant, indicating that residues 14–22 are critical for the β-transition and fibril formation. Thermodynamic analysis of the kinetics of fibril formation by apoA-I 1–83/G26R indicated that both nucleation and fibril growth are enthalpically unfavorable, whereas entropically, nucleation is favorable, but fibril growth is unfavorable. Interestingly, the nucleation of the Δ50–58 variant was entropically unfavorable, indicating that residues 50–58 entropically promote the nucleation step in fibril formation of apoA-I 1–83/G26R. Moreover, a residue-level structural investigation of apoA-I 1–83/G26R fibrils with site-specific pyrene labeling indicated that the two amyloidogenic segments are in close proximity to form an amyloid core structure, whereas the N- and C-terminal tail regions are excluded from the amyloid core.

https://openalex.org/W2963706142,"In Attention Deficit Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), fMRI studies show asymmetric alterations: widespread hypoactivation in anterior cortical areas and hyperactivation in some posterior regions, and the latter is considered to be related to compensatory processes. In Posner’s attentional networks, an important role is attributed to functional interhemispheric asymmetries. The psychophysiological Attention Network Test (ANT), which measures the efficiency of the alerting, orienting, and executive networks, seems particularly informative for ADHD. Potentials related to ANT stimuli (ANT-RPs) have revealed reduced cognitive potential P3 in ADHD. However, there are no studies associated with asymmetry of ANT-RPs. In the present study, conducted with 20 typically developing boys and 19 boys with ADHD, aged 11–13 years, the efficiency of the three Posner’s networks regarding performance and amplitude asymmetries in ANT-RPs was evaluated according to the arithmetic difference of these parameters between different cue and target presentation conditions. The results were correlated to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) scores. Regarding accuracy and intraindividual variation in reaction time, ADHD subjects showed lower efficiency of executive and alerting network, and this effect was correlated with DSM. Regarding alerting network, ANT-RPs in ADHD did not have the right-side amplitude prevalence in the temporal regions, which was observed in controls. In all ANT conditions, significantly higher asymmetries were observed in ADHD than in controls in the occipital regions 40–200 ms after target onset. Their amplitude in ADHD subjects was inversely proportional to DSM scores of inattentiveness and directly proportional to accuracy and efficiency of the executive network. The results suggest impaired alerting and executive networks in ADHD and compensatory occipital mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2962763924,"Coastal storms have consequences for human lives and infrastructure but also create important early successional habitats for myriad species. For example, storm-induced overwash creates nesting habitat for shorebirds like piping plovers (Charadrius melodus). We examined how piping plover habitat extent and location changed on barrier islands in New York, New Jersey, and Virginia after Hurricane Sandy made landfall following the 2012 breeding season. We modeled nesting habitat using a nest presence/absence dataset that included characterizations of coastal morphology and vegetation. Using a Bayesian network, we predicted nesting habitat for each study site for the years 2010/2011, 2012, and 2014/2015 based on remotely sensed spatial datasets (e.g., lidar, orthophotos). We found that Hurricane Sandy increased piping plover habitat by 9 to 300% at 4 of 5 study sites but that one site saw a decrease in habitat by 27%. The amount, location, and longevity of new habitat appeared to be influenced by the level of human development at each site. At three of the five sites, the amount of habitat created and the time new habitat persisted were inversely related to the amount of development. Furthermore, the proportion of new habitat created in high-quality overwash was inversely related to the level of development on study areas, from 17% of all new habitat in overwash at one of the most densely developed sites to 80% of all new habitat at an undeveloped site. We also show that piping plovers exploited new habitat after the storm, with 14-57% of all nests located in newly created habitat in the 2013 breeding season. Our results quantify the importance of storms in creating and maintaining coastal habitats for beach-nesting species like piping plovers, and these results suggest a negative correlation between human development and beneficial ecological impacts of these natural disturbances."

Dysfunction in dopamine-related and non-dopamine-related pathways, changes in cortical networks related with swallowing and peripheral mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of dysphagia. We aimed at investigating whether dysphagia is associated with presynaptic dopaminergic deficits, faster motor symptom progression and cognitive decline in a population of early drug-naïve patients with Parkinson's disease.By exploring the database of Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative we identified forty-nine early drug-naïve Parkinson's disease patients with dysphagia. Dysphagia was identified with SCOPA-AUT question 1 (answer regularly) and was assessed with MDS-UPDRS Part-II, Item 2.3 (Chewing and Swallowing). We compared Parkinson's disease patients with dysphagia to Parkinson's disease patients without dysphagia, and investigated differences in striatal [123I]FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography levels. Using Cox proportional hazards analyses, we also evaluated whether dysphagia can predict motor deterioration and cognitive dysfunction.Parkinson's disease patients with dysphagia, harbored a greater deterioration regarding motor and non-motor symptoms and decreased [123I]FP-CIT binding when compared with patients without dysphagia. Higher burden of dysphagia (MDS-UPDRS-II, item 2.3) was correlated with lower [123I]FP-CIT uptakes within the striatum (rs = -0.157; P = 0.002) and the caudate (rs = -0.156; P = 0.002). The presence of dysphagia was not a predictor of motor progression (Hazard ratio [HR]: 1.143, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.848-1.541; P = 0.379) or cognitive decline (HR: 1.294, 95% CI: 0.616-2.719; P = 0.496).Dysphagia is associated with decreased presynaptic dopaminergic integrity within caudate and greater motor and non-motor symptoms burden in early drug-naïve PD."
https://openalex.org/W2962776709,"Introduction Liver transplant (LT) recipients have limited understanding of post-transplant chronic kidney disease (CKD) despite an excellent pre-existing framework of transplant care. This pilot study examined the efficacy and feasibility of a tailored educational and goal-setting tool in improving CKD knowledge among LT recipients with early-stage CKD. Methods In this prospective cohort study, we administered the CKD educational and goal-setting tool to 81 LT recipients between 7/1/2016 and 12/31/2017. We excluded patients with simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation, eGFR<30 ml/min, non-English speaking, on hemodialysis or listed for kidney transplantation. The pre- and post-education knowledge scores were compared using a paired t-test. Linear regression was used to assess the independent predictors of change in knowledge score. Results Mean age was 56.3 years, 69.1% were males, 85.2% were Caucasians and mean eGFR was 61.2 ± 20.0 ml/min. The CKD educational and goal-setting tool improved the CKD knowledge scores among LT recipients (pre: 71.8 ± 16.6%, post: 83.3 ± 10.4%; p<0.001). In an adjusted model (r2 = 0.75), those with lower pre-education knowledge scores had the most improvement in their post-education knowledge scores (β = -83.2; p<0.001). Two-thirds stated their most important self-management goal and reported motivation to follow this goal. Time spent for the CKD education was approximately 15 minutes. Conclusions A simple LT-specific patient educational and goal-setting tool effectively improved CKD knowledge. Implementation of this tailored intervention will improve CKD awareness and may promote goal-setting in the target population."

Spring onion seed demand forecasting, which can help reduce the high operational costs increased by long-period propagation and complex logistics, has not previously been investigated yet. This paper provides a novel perspective on spring onion seed demand forecasting and proposes a hybrid Holt-Winters and support vector machine (SVM) forecasting model. The model uses dynamic factors, including historical seed sales, seed inventory, spring onion crop market price and weather data, as inputs to forecast spring onion seed demand. Forecasting error, i.e. the difference between actual and forecasted demand, is assessed. Two advanced machine learning models are trained on the same dataset as benchmark models. Numerical experiments using actual commercial sales data for three spring onion seed varieties show the proposed hybrid model outperformed the statistical-based models for all three forecasting errors. Seed inventory, spring onion crop market price and historical seed sales are the most important dynamic factors, among which seed inventory has short-term influence while other two have mid-term influence on seed demand forecasting. The absolute minimum temperature is the only factor having long-term influence. This study provides a promising spring onion seed demand forecasting model that helps understand the relationships between seed demand and other dynamic factors and the model could potentially be applied to demand forecasting of other crop seeds to reduce total operational costs."

https://openalex.org/W2962929926,"In this paper, we propose a human action recognition method using HOIRM (histogram of oriented interest region motion) feature fusion and a BOW (bag of words) model based on AP (affinity propagation) clustering. First, a HOIRM feature extraction method based on spatiotemporal interest points ROI is proposed. HOIRM can be regarded as a middle-level feature between local and global features. Then, HOIRM is fused with 3D HOG and 3D HOF local features using a cumulative histogram. The method further improves the robustness of local features to camera view angle and distance variations in complex scenes, which in turn improves the correct rate of action recognition. Finally, a BOW model based on AP clustering is proposed and applied to action classification. It obtains the appropriate visual dictionary capacity and achieves better clustering effect for the joint description of a variety of features. The experimental results demonstrate that by using the fused features with the proposed BOW model, the average recognition rate is 95.75% in the KTH database, and 88.25% in the UCF database, which are both higher than those by using only 3D HOG+3D HOF or HOIRM features. Moreover, the average recognition rate achieved by the proposed method in the two databases is higher than that obtained by other methods."

https://openalex.org/W2962870986,"Using a well-established model species for demographic, behavioural and aging research, the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata), we explored whether nutritional stress early in adult life affects the sexual performance and survival in older ages. To do so we established two different protein starvation (PS) protocols that included the elimination of proteinaceous diet either before or after sexual maturity of male medflies. The frequency of sexual signalling and the age of death were daily recorded. Sexual signalling is directly related with male mating success in this model system. PS early in adult life results in high mortality rates (similar to sugar-only fed males), which are gradually restored in more advanced ages. Provision of a proteinaceous diet following early-life PS increases straightaway male sexual signalling to levels similar with those having continuous access to proteinaceous diet. Switching diet regimes from a protein-free to a protein-rich one progressively compensates mortality rates. Apparently, males prioritize sexual signalling over lifespan. PS after attaining sexual maturity significantly reduces both longevity and sexual performance. Access to protein only early in life is insufficient to support lifetime energy-consuming behaviours such as sexual signalling. Continuous access to a proteinaceous diet determines both lifetime sexual performance and longevity. Early in life PS males prioritize the allocation of nutritional elements, when available, in sexual activities over soma-maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2963083576,"Neurogenin-3 (NEUROG3) is a helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factor involved in the production of endocrine cells in the intestine and pancreas of humans and mice. However, the human NEUROG3 loss-of-function phenotype differs subtly from that in mice, but the reason for this difference remains poorly understood. Because NEUROG3 expression precedes exit of the cell cycle and the expression of endocrine cell markers during differentiation, we investigated the effect of lentivirus-mediated overexpression of the human NEUROG3 gene on the cell cycle of BON4 cells and various human nonendocrine cell lines. NEUROG3 overexpression induced a reversible cell cycle exit, whereas expression of a neuronal lineage homolog, NEUROG1, had no such effect. In endocrine lineage cells, the cellular quiescence induced by short-term NEUROG3 expression required cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A)/p21CIP1 expression. Expression of endocrine differentiation markers required sustained NEUROG3 expression in the quiescent, but not in the senescent, state. Inhibition of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) pathway reversed quiescence by inducing cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and reducing p21CIP1 and NEUROG3 protein levels in BON4 cells and human enteroids. We discovered that NEUROG3 expression stimulates expression of CDKN2a/p16INK4a and BMI1 proto-oncogene polycomb ring finger (BMI1), with the latter limiting expression of the former, delaying the onset of CDKN2a/p16INK4a-driven cellular senescence. Furthermore, NEUROG3 bound to the promoters of both CDKN1a/p21CIP1 and BMI1 genes, and BMI1 attenuated NEUROG3 binding to the CDKN1a/p21CIP1 promoter. Our findings reveal how human NEUROG3 integrates inputs from multiple signaling pathways and thereby mediates cell cycle exit at the onset of differentiation. Neurogenin-3 (NEUROG3) is a helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factor involved in the production of endocrine cells in the intestine and pancreas of humans and mice. However, the human NEUROG3 loss-of-function phenotype differs subtly from that in mice, but the reason for this difference remains poorly understood. Because NEUROG3 expression precedes exit of the cell cycle and the expression of endocrine cell markers during differentiation, we investigated the effect of lentivirus-mediated overexpression of the human NEUROG3 gene on the cell cycle of BON4 cells and various human nonendocrine cell lines. NEUROG3 overexpression induced a reversible cell cycle exit, whereas expression of a neuronal lineage homolog, NEUROG1, had no such effect. In endocrine lineage cells, the cellular quiescence induced by short-term NEUROG3 expression required cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A)/p21CIP1 expression.

However, the lifespan developmental approach provides a framework for research in human sensorimotor control of the head-neck complex. A cross-sectional design was used to investigate the influence of age on head-neck dynamic performance adopted by asymptomatic Children, Adults and Seniors using a standardized task (DidRen Laser test). Participants performed 5 cycles of left/right head-neck complex fast rotational movements toward 3 targets with 30° of angular separation. Dynamic performances were computed from total execution time of the test and kinematic variables derived from rotational motion of head measured by an optoelectronic system. Eighty-one participants, aged 8–85 yrs, were stratified in four groups: Children, Younger adults, Older adults and Seniors. Children were significantly slower than Younger (p<0.001) and Older adults (p<0.004) and Seniors slower than Younger adults (p<0.017) to perform the test. Children adopted a lower average speed compared to Younger (p<0.001) and Older adults (p<0.008). Children reached the peaks speed significantly later than Younger (p<0.004) and Older adults (p<0.04) and acceleration significantly later than Younger (p<0.001) and Older adults (p<0.013). From the peak acceleration, Children reached end of the cycle significantly slower than Younger (p<0.008) and Older adults (p<0.008). Children significantly differed from all other groups for rotational kinetic energy, with smaller values compared to Younger adults (p<0.001), Older adults (p<0.005) and Seniors (p<0.012). Variability was also significantly higher for Seniors and Children. In conclusion, age influences head-neck visually elicited rotational dynamics, especially in Children. These results suggest that age should be taken into account when establishing normative data and assessing dynamic head-neck sensorimotor control of patients with neck pain."
https://openalex.org/W2963976762,"Dozens of mutations throughout the sequence of the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) have been linked to toxic protein aggregation in the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A parsimonious explanation for numerous genotypes resulting in a common phenotype would be mutation-induced perturbation of the folding free-energy surface that increases the populations of high-energy states prone to aggregation. The absence of intermediates in the folding of monomeric SOD1 suggests that the unfolded ensemble is a potential source of aggregation. To test this hypothesis, here we dissected SOD1 into a set of peptides end-labeled with FRET probes to model the local behavior of the corresponding sequences in the unfolded ensemble. Using time-resolved FRET, we observed that the peptide corresponding to the Loop VII-β8 sequence at the SOD1 C terminus was uniquely sensitive to denaturant. Utilizing a two-dimensional form of maximum entropy modeling, we demonstrate that the sensitivity to denaturant is the surprising result of a two-state-like transition from a compact to an expanded state. Variations of the peptide sequence revealed that the compact state involves a nonnative interaction between the disordered N terminus and the hydrophobic C terminus of the peptide. This nonnative intramolecular structure could serve as a precursor for intermolecular association and result in aggregation associated with ALS. We propose that this precursor would provide a common molecular target for therapeutic intervention in the dozens of ALS-linked SOD1 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2963957016,"To investigate the modulation of genes whose expression level is indicative of stress and toxicity following exposure to three anaesthesia techniques, general anaesthesia (GA), regional anaesthesia (RA), or integrated anaesthesia (IA).Patients scheduled for hip arthroplasty receiving GA, RA and IA were enrolled at Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute of Bologna, Italy and the expression of genes involved in toxicology were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected before (T0), immediately after surgery (T1), and on the third day (T2) after surgery in association with biochemical parameters.All three anaesthesia methods proved safe and reliable in terms of pain relief and patient recovery. Gene ontology analysis revealed that GA and mainly IA were associated with deregulation of DNA repair system and stress-responsive genes, which was observed even after 3-days from anaesthesia. Conversely, RA was not associated with substantial changes in gene expression.Based on the gene expression analysis, RA technique showed the smallest toxicological effect in hip arthroplasty.ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT03585647."
https://openalex.org/W2963592233,"Among the earliest protein products of most cellular genes are those synthesized during the pioneer round of translation (PRT), a key step in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) that allows scanning of new transcripts for the presence of a premature termination codon (PTC). It has been demonstrated that at least some PRT degradation products can be targeted to major histocompatibility (MHC)-I presentation. To gain new insight into this putative PRT-to-MHC-I route, we have assembled 2 pairs of reporter genes so that the 2 genes in each pair encode an identical fusion protein between a model antigenic peptide and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), one of which harbors a PTC. We expressed these genes in different mouse and human cell lines and confirmed enhanced NMD activity for the PTC(+) gene in each pair by monitoring the effect of cycloheximide on the level of the respective mRNA. We then exploited several strategies for establishing the ratio between level of peptide presentation and total amount of protein product. We consistently observed significantly higher ratios for the PTC(+) mRNAs compared with the PTC(-) ones, pointing to correlation between the turnover of otherwise identical proteins and the fate of their template mRNA. Using confocal microscopy, we showed a clear link between NMD, the presence of misfolded EGFP polypeptides, and enhanced MHC-I peptide presentation. Altogether, these findings imply that identical full-length gene products differing only in 3' noncoding sequences can be differentially degraded and targeted to the MHC-I presentation pathway, suggesting a more general role for the PRT in establishing the MHC-I peptidome.-Weinstein-Marom, H., Hendel, L., Laron, E.
