https://openalex.org/W2012615693,"Theoretical and empirical research highlights the role of punishment in promoting collaborative efforts. However, both the emergence and the stability of costly punishment are problematic issues. It is not clear how punishers can invade a society of defectors by social learning or natural selection, or how second-order free-riders (who contribute to the joint effort but not to the sanctions) can be prevented from drifting into a coercion-based regime and subverting cooperation. Here we compare the prevailing model of peer-punishment with pool-punishment, which consists in committing resources, before the collaborative effort, to prepare sanctions against free-riders. Pool-punishment facilitates the sanctioning of second-order free-riders, because these are exposed even if everyone contributes to the common good. In the absence of such second-order punishment, peer-punishers do better than pool-punishers; but with second-order punishment, the situation is reversed. Efficiency is traded for stability. Neither other-regarding tendencies or preferences for reciprocity and equity, nor group selection or prescriptions from higher authorities, are necessary for the emergence and stability of rudimentary forms of sanctioning institutions regulating common pool resources and enforcing collaborative efforts."

https://openalex.org/W2108045872,"Anecdotal information and case reports suggest that intravenously administered vitamin C is used by Complementary and Alternate Medicine (CAM) practitioners. The scale of such use in the U.S. and associated side effects are unknown.We surveyed attendees at annual CAM Conferences in 2006 and 2008, and determined sales of intravenous vitamin C by major U.S. manufacturers/distributors. We also queried practitioners for side effects, compiled published cases, and analyzed FDA's Adverse Events Database. Of 199 survey respondents (out of 550), 172 practitioners administered IV vitamin C to 11,233 patients in 2006 and 8876 patients in 2008. Average dose was 28 grams every 4 days, with 22 total treatments per patient. Estimated yearly doses used (as 25 g/50 ml vials) were 318,539 in 2006 and 354,647 in 2008. Manufacturers' yearly sales were 750,000 and 855,000 vials, respectively. Common reasons for treatment included infection, cancer, and fatigue. Of 9,328 patients for whom data is available, 101 had side effects, mostly minor, including lethargy/fatigue in 59 patients, change in mental status in 21 patients and vein irritation/phlebitis in 6 patients. Publications documented serious adverse events, including 2 deaths in patients known to be at risk for IV vitamin C. Due to confounding causes, the FDA Adverse Events Database was uninformative. Total numbers of patients treated in the US with high dose vitamin C cannot be accurately estimated from this study.High dose IV vitamin C is in unexpectedly wide use by CAM practitioners. Other than the known complications of IV vitamin C in those with renal impairment or glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, high dose intravenous vitamin C appears to be remarkably safe. Physicians should inquire about IV vitamin C use in patients with cancer, chronic, untreatable, or intractable conditions and be observant of unexpected harm, drug interactions, or benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2093012794,"Microtubules are an important component of the cytoskeleton, generally organized in vivo in groups of 13 protofilaments around a core of γ-tubulin complexes. How this precise geometry is controlled remains unclear. The structure of higher-order assemblies of the universally conserved core microtubule nucleating complex, γ-tubulin small complex (γTuSC) — isolated from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae — has now been determined using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure provides insight into how γTuSC establishes thirteen-fold tubulin symmetry. XXXMicrotubules are nucleated in vivo by γ-tubulin complexes and comprise 13 protofilaments. How this precise geometry is controlled remains unclear. These authors report the cryo-electron microscopic structure of the universally conserved, core microtubule nucleating complex, γ-tubulin small complex. The structure provides insight into how this complex establishes thirteen-fold tubulin symmetry. Microtubules are nucleated in vivo by γ-tubulin complexes. The 300-kDa γ-tubulin small complex (γ-TuSC), consisting of two molecules of γ-tubulin and one copy each of the accessory proteins Spc97 and Spc98, is the conserved, essential core of the microtubule nucleating machinery1,2. In metazoa multiple γ-TuSCs assemble with other proteins into γ-tubulin ring complexes (γ-TuRCs). The structure of γ-TuRC indicated that it functions as a microtubule template2,3,4,5. Because each γ-TuSC contains two molecules of γ-tubulin, it was assumed that the γ-TuRC-specific proteins are required to organize γ-TuSCs to match 13-fold microtubule symmetry. Here we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae γ-TuSC forms rings even in the absence of other γ-TuRC components. The yeast adaptor protein Spc110 stabilizes the rings into extended filaments and is required for oligomer formation under physiological buffer conditions. The 8-Å cryo-electron microscopic reconstruction of the filament reveals 13 γ-tubulins per turn, matching microtubule symmetry, with plus ends exposed for interaction with microtubules, implying that one turn of the filament constitutes a microtubule template. The domain structures of Spc97 and Spc98 suggest functions for conserved sequence motifs, with implications for the γ-TuRC-specific proteins. The γ-TuSC filaments nucleate microtubules at a low level, and the structure provides a strong hypothesis for how nucleation is regulated, converting this less active form to a potent nucleator."
https://openalex.org/W1999218428,"Background Aging results in a progressive loss of skeletal muscle, a condition known as sarcopenia. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations accumulate with aging in skeletal muscle and correlate with muscle loss, although no causal relationship has been established. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the relationship between mtDNA mutations and sarcopenia at the gene expression and biochemical levels using a mouse model that expresses a proofreading-deficient version (D257A) of the mitochondrial DNA Polymerase γ, resulting in increased spontaneous mtDNA mutation rates. Gene expression profiling of D257A mice followed by Parametric Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment (PAGE) indicates that the D257A mutation is associated with a profound downregulation of gene sets associated with mitochondrial function. At the biochemical level, sarcopenia in D257A mice is associated with a marked reduction (35–50%) in the content of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes I, III and IV, all of which are partly encoded by mtDNA. D257A mice display impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics associated with compromised state-3 respiration, lower ATP content and a resulting decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). Surprisingly, mitochondrial dysfunction was not accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production or oxidative damage. Conclusions/Significance These findings demonstrate that mutations in mtDNA can be causal in sarcopenia by affecting the assembly of functional ETC complexes, the lack of which provokes a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation, without an increase in oxidative stress, and ultimately, skeletal muscle apoptosis and sarcopenia."

Evidence increasingly assigns an immunosuppressive role for miRNAs in immunity, but relatively few miRNAs have been studied, and an overall understanding of the importance of these regulatory transcripts in complex in vivo systems is lacking. Here we have applied multiple technologies to globally analyze miRNA expression and function in allergic lung disease, an experimental model of asthma. Deep sequencing and microarray analyses of the mouse lung short RNAome revealed numerous extant and novel miRNAs and other transcript classes.

A possible role for miRNA editing in altering the lung mRNA target repertoire was also identified. Multiple members of the highly conserved let-7 miRNA family were the most abundant lung miRNAs, and we confirmed in vitro that interleukin 13 (IL-13), a cytokine essential for expression for allergic lung disease, is regulated by mmu-let-7a. However, inhibition of let-7 miRNAs in vivo using a locked nucleic acid profoundly inhibited production of allergic cytokines and the disease phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W1979042611,"Multiple pathways prevent DNA replication from occurring more than once per cell cycle. These pathways block re-replication by strictly controlling the activity of pre-replication complexes, which assemble at specific sites in the genome called origins. Here we show that mutations in the homologous histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) monomethyltransferases, ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED PROTEIN5 (ATXR5) and ATXR6, lead to re-replication of specific genomic locations. Most of these locations correspond to transposons and other repetitive and silent elements of the Arabidopsis genome. These sites also correspond to high levels of H3K27 monomethylation, and mutation of the catalytic SET domain is sufficient to cause the re-replication defect. Mutation of ATXR5 and ATXR6 also causes upregulation of transposon expression and has pleiotropic effects on plant development. These results uncover a novel pathway that prevents over-replication of heterochromatin in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2016161236,"Crucial aspects about the life cycle of high-mass stars remain unclear, in particular the early evolutionary phases. For instance, it is still debated whether high-mass stars form in the same way as low- and intermediate-mass stars, through disk accretion, and if so, whether the structure of these disks would differ from their low-mass counterparts. New observations from the Very Large Telescope Interferometer at the European Southern Observatory now reveal a hot compact disk around a massive young stellar object, the protostar IRAS 13481-6124. The image shows an elongated structure about 13 × 19 astronomical units in size, consistent with a disk seen at an inclination angle of ∼45°, the properties of which are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the disks observed during the formation of low-mass stars. Circumstellar disks are an essential ingredient of the formation of low-mass stars, but it is unclear whether they are also required for the formation of stars more massive than about 10 solar masses. Clear observational evidence is needed, for example the detection of dusty disks around massive young stellar objects. Here, near-infrared interferometric observations are reported that spatially resolve the distribution of hot material around a high-mass young stellar object. Circumstellar disks are an essential ingredient of the formation1 of low-mass stars. It is unclear, however, whether the accretion-disk paradigm can also account for the formation of stars more massive than about 10 solar masses2, in which strong radiation pressure might halt mass infall3,4. Massive stars may form by stellar merging5, although more recent theoretical investigations suggest that the radiative-pressure limit may be overcome by considering more complex, non-spherical infall geometries6,7. Clear observational evidence, such as the detection of compact dusty disks8 around massive young stellar objects, is needed to identify unambiguously the formation mode of the most massive stars. Here we report near-infrared interferometric observations that spatially resolve the astronomical-unit-scale distribution of hot material around a high-mass (∼20 solar masses) young stellar object. The image shows an elongated structure with a size of ∼13 × 19 astronomical units, consistent with a disk seen at an inclination angle of ∼45°. Using geometric and detailed physical models, we found a radial temperature gradient in the disk, with a dust-free region less than 9.5 astronomical units from the star, qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the disks observed in low-mass star formation. Perpendicular to the disk plane we observed a molecular outflow and two bow shocks, indicating that a bipolar outflow emanates from the inner regions of the system."
https://openalex.org/W2161637965,"Background Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder at old age, can be caused by elevated expression or the A53T missense mutation of the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein (SNCA). PD is characterized pathologically by the preferential vulnerability of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal projection neurons. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we used two mouse lines overexpressing human A53T-SNCA and studied striatal dysfunction in the absence of neurodegeneration to understand early disease mechanisms. To characterize the progression, we employed young adult as well as old mice. Analysis of striatal neurotransmitter content demonstrated that dopamine (DA) levels correlated directly with the level of expression of SNCA, an observation also made in SNCA-deficient (knockout, KO) mice. However, the elevated DA levels in the striatum of old A53T-SNCA overexpressing mice may not be transmitted appropriately, in view of three observations. First, a transcriptional downregulation of the extraneural DA degradation enzyme catechol-ortho-methytransferase (COMT) was found. Second, an upregulation of DA receptors was detected by immunoblots and autoradiography. Third, extensive transcriptome studies via microarrays and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) of altered transcript levels of the DA-inducible genes Atf2, Cb1, Freq, Homer1 and Pde7b indicated a progressive and genotype-dependent reduction in the postsynaptic DA response. As a functional consequence, long term depression (LTD) was absent in corticostriatal slices from old transgenic mice. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, the dysfunctional neurotransmission and impaired synaptic plasticity seen in the A53T-SNCA overexpressing mice reflect early changes within the basal ganglia prior to frank neurodegeneration. As a model of preclinical stages of PD, such insights may help to develop neuroprotective therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2028188448,"Signal transduction in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is mediated primarily by the Ser/Thr protein kinases and the two-component systems. The Ser/Thr kinase PknH has been shown to regulate growth of M. tuberculosis in a mouse model and in response to NO stress in vitro. Comparison of a pknH deletion mutant (ΔpknH) with its parental M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain using iTRAQ enabled us to quantify >700 mycobacterial proteins. Among these, members of the hypoxia- and NO-inducible dormancy (DosR) regulon were disregulated in the ΔpknH mutant. Using kinase assays, protein-protein interactions, and mass spectrometry analysis, we demonstrated that the two-component response regulator DosR is a substrate of PknH. PknH phosphorylation of DosR mapped to Thr(198) and Thr(205) on the key regulatory helix α10 involved in activation and dimerization of DosR. PknH Thr phosphorylation and DosS Asp phosphorylation of DosR cooperatively enhanced DosR binding to cognate DNA sequences. Transcriptional analysis comparing ΔpknH and parental M. tuberculosis revealed that induction of the DosR regulon was subdued in the ΔpknH mutant in response to NO. Together, these results indicate that PknH phosphorylation of DosR is required for full induction of the DosR regulon and demonstrate convergence of the two major signal transduction systems for the first time in M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2139069763,"Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin that must be obtained in the diet or through supplementation. For > 50 yr, it has been known that folate plays an integral role in embryonic development. In mice, inactivation of genes in the folate pathway results in malformations of the neural tube, heart, and craniofacial structures. It has been shown that diets and blood levels of women who had a fetus with a neural tube defect are low for several micronutrients, particularly folate. Periconceptional use of folic acid containing supplements decreased recurrent neural tube defects in the offspring of women with a previously affected child and the occurrence of a neural tube defect and possibly other birth defects in the offspring of women with no prior history. Based on these findings, the U.S. Public Health Service recommended that all women at risk take folic acid supplements, but many did not. Mandatory food fortification programs were introduced in numerous countries, including the United States, to improve folate nutritional status and have resulted in a major decrease in neural tube defect prevalence. The success story of folate represents the cooperation of embryologists, experimentalists, epidemiologists, public health scientists, and policymakers.—Običan, S. G., Finnell, R. H., Mills, J.

https://openalex.org/W1985209353,"Human DNMT3A is responsible for de novo DNA cytosine methylation patterning during development.

Although 70–80% of CpG sites are methylated in the genome, some regions (CpG islands) are largely resistant to methylation, whereas others (retrotransposons and highly repetitive sequences) undergo extensive methylation (8Chen Z.X.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) are extremely processive, whereas other bacterial enzymes, including methyltransferase EcoRI (21Surby M.A. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2201-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), are entirely lacking in processivity. In this study, we investigated the enzymatic properties of the human de novo methyltransferase DNMT3A and determined its processivity using pulse-chase assays and kinetic modeling and determining kcat values for substrates with a varying number of CpG sites. We found that DNMT3A is processive, spreading methylation to distal CpG sites. DNMT3A processivity is modulated by DNA topology and protein-protein interactions. DNMT3L, a known activator of DNMT3A catalytic activity, is shown to be a processivity factor of DNMT3A. The data presented support a model of DNA methylation spreading through the action of processive catalysis. The DNA used as substrates, poly(dI-dC) (∼1000 bp) (Sigma-Aldrich), poly(dA-dT) (∼1000 bp) (Sigma-Aldrich), GCbox2 (5′-GGGAATTCAAGGGGCGGGGCAATGTTAGGG-3′) duplex, and Gusch (5′-TCAAAAAGGATCTTCACCTAG-3′) duplex (non-CpG containing sequence), were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). The recognition site for DNMT3A is underlined. Duplexes were prepared by annealing the complementary strands in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl, heating the DNA to 85 °C for 5 min, and slow-cooling the DNA. Annealing was confirmed by 12% PAGE analysis. Bacterial plasmid pBR322 (New England Biolabs) was produced by transforming the plasmid in XL blue cells (New England Biolabs) (Escherichia coli, with no topoisomerase mutations), which were then grown in LB media overnight at 37 °C.

The primers for the promoters are listed in supplemental Table 1. The PCR products were then used as the substrate for further amplification of each promoter. The sequences of the PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. Plasmid pCpGL was kindly provided by Michael Rehli (22Klug M. Rehli M.

Promoters were digested with HindIII and BamHI and then ligated into digested and gel-purified pCpGL. The inserted sequence was confirmed by sequencing. The pCpGL and p21-pCpGL substrates were produced by transforming into GT115-competent cells (InvivoGen) and then grown overnight in LB media at 37 °C. The plasmid was extracted using a HiSpeed plasmid midi kit (Qiagen). The linear p21-pCpGL was digested with BamHI endonuclease overnight at 37 °C and purified using a Qiagen PCR cleanup kit. The form of the substrates was confirmed by analyzes on 0.8% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.

DNA concentrations are given in base pairs unless noted otherwise. Concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 260 nm, using the following molar absorptive coefficients: poly(dI-dC), 6.9 mm−1 cm−1; poly(dA-dT), 6.6 mm−1 cm−1; and for promoters and plasmids, 6.8 mm−1 cm−1 for the number of base pairs and Gusch 0.4123 m−1 cm−1 and GCbox2 0.3038 m−1 cm−1 for the number of molecules.

Full-length DNMT3A and DNMT3L were expressed in E. coli strain Rosetta2 (DE3) pLysS (from Novagen), and the DNMT3A catalytic domain was expressed in E. coli strain ER2566 (New England Biolabs) that had previously been transformed with the pLysS plasmid (Novagen). Cell cultures were grown in 2× YT media at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 0.9 (DNMT3A), 0.4 (DNMT3L), and 0.7 (DNMT3A catalytic domain). The temperature was lowered for full-length DNMT3A and DNMT3A catalytic domain to 28 °C, and expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Fisher Scientific). Induction was 2 h for DNMT3A and DNMT3L and 4 h for the DNMT3A catalytic domain. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at −80 °C. DNMT3A was purified from cells lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, with 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.4 mm PMSF, and 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) with a French press in the presence of 25 μg/ml DNase I and then clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted to 300 mm NaCl and loaded onto a Biorex-70 column (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-Cl, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, with 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 1 μm pepstatin A (BioRex wash buffer) followed by the same buffer but with 400 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted in BioRex wash buffer containing 800 mm NaCl (and no EDTA). The eluant was brought to 40 mm imidazole (nickel wash buffer) and loaded on a 2-ml His·Bind resin (Novagen), which was washed with nickel wash buffer followed by a short wash of the same buffer with no Triton X-100. Protein was eluted with nickel wash buffer (400 mm NaCl, 400 mm imidazole, and no Triton X-100). The protein was then dialyzed into storage buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.2, with 0.5 mm DTT) and stored at −80 °C. The catalytic domain (Δ1–611) was purified as described in Purdy et al.(24Purdy M.M. Holz-Schietinger C. Reich N.O. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 498: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly the catalytic domain was purified by a DEAE column and a nickel-Sepharose column followed by a BioRex-70 column and dialyzed into storage buffer. DNMT3L was purified from cells lysed by French press in nickel buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm EDTA, 40 mm imidazole, with 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) with 25 μg/ml DNase I and 1 mm PMSF and then clarified by centrifugation. Supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen). The column was washed with nickel buffer and eluted with nickel buffer with 500 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against chitin binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCL, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) and bound to the chitin resin. DNMT3L was cleaved from the bound chitin-binding protein using chitin cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 500 mm NaCl, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). The eluted protein was dialyzed into storage buffer and frozen at −80 °C (25Kareta M.S. Botello Z.M. Ennis J.J. Chou C. Chédin F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Protein purities of 85, 90, and 95% for full-length DNMT3A, DNMT3A catalytic domain, and DNMT3L, respectively, were estimated by densitometry of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentrations were determined by using calculated (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar) 280 nm extinction coefficients, which were within 20% of Bradford assay results using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The total concentration was calculated by multiplying the total protein concentration by the fraction of purity. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C in a buffer of 50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 20 mm NaCl, 2 μm AdoMet (a 6 Ci/mmol mix of unlabeled and [3H]methyl-labeled) at pH 7.8. Aliquots of 20 μl were removed from a larger reaction. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 500 μm unlabeled AdoMet and digestion with 50 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 5 min (27Suetake I. Miyazaki J. Murakami C. Takeshima H. Tajima S. J Biochem. 2003; 133: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Samples were spotted onto Whatman DE81 filters and then washed, dried, and counted as described previously (28Peterson S.N. Reich N.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). kcat values were determined as described previously except with DNMT3A at 150 nm and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, in place of phosphate. For each substrate, the kcat value was obtained by varying the substrate concentration (10 concentrations per substrate between 0 and 50 μm bp). Each reaction was initiated with DNA, run for 1 h at 37 °C, and quenched as stated above. The data were fit to Michaelis-Menten or substrate inhibition equations using Prism Version 4.0 (GraphPad Software). kcat values were calculated by dividing the Vmax values by the amount of active enzyme in the reaction. The kcat values for each substrate were compared with the number of CpG sites and the size of the promoters, and data were fit to a linear regression using the Prism Version 4.0 program. Processivity assays were carried out with DNMT3A or the DNMT3A-catalytic domain at 50 nm. The reaction was initiated following a 3-min preincubation at 37 °C by the addition of substrate DNA: poly(dI-dC) (5 μm), pBR322 (10 μm), ESF1 (10 μm), or p21-pCpGL (10 μm). The addition of 200 μm plasmid pCpGL (lacks CpG sites (22Klug M. Rehli M. Epigenetics. 2006; 1: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) after 20 min (unless otherwise noted)) forms the “chase” condition. The addition of this same chase DNA at the start of the reaction concurrent with DNA substrate addition provides a control. DNMT3L was tested for its activation of DNMT3A by varying DNMT3L from 12.5 to 200 nm with 50 nm DNMT3A and poly(dI-dC) at 25 μm. DNMT3A and DNMT3L were preincubated in reaction buffer with AdoMet for 1 h at 37 °C before starting the reaction with DNA. Reactions were run for 1 h and stopped as stated above, and methylation was counted. A 1:1 ratio (50 nm) with the 1-h preincubation (with AdoMet) gave the maximum amount of activity, which was used for all DNMT3L assays. The -fold stimulation was calculated by product formed by DNMT3A with DNMT3L divided by product formed by DNMT3A without DNMT3L. Activation by DNMT3L on DNMT3A on poly(dI-dC) and GCbox2 was carried out with DNA at 20 μm, and the reaction was run for 1 h. Four replicates were used in each reaction to obtain the error bars shown in Figs. 1, 3, 4, and 5 (mean S.D.). Processivity assays, which include DNMT3L, had the same conditions (buffer, enzyme, and DNA concentrations) as the DNMT3A processivity assays, which included the preincubation of DNMT3L with DNMT3A as stated above.FIGURE 3Commitment for processivity.

Data fit separately before the experimental reaction had chaser DNA added (time 0–20 min) and after chaser DNA was added (20–260 min), using Prism Version 4.0 (GraphPad Software). Error bars in Figs. 1, 3, 4, and 5 represent the mean S.D. of at least three replicates. The number of turnovers is calculated by product formed (nm) divided by catalytic active sites (nm) (total protein concentration times the percentage of active sites (18%)). The percentage of active sites (18%) was determined as described previously in Purdy et al. (24Purdy M.M. Holz-Schietinger C. Reich N.O. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 498: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Inactive DNMT3A that can bind DNA should not affect the assays or the measurement of processivity because the substrate DNA is in great excess to the total amount of enzyme (active and non-active enzyme). The change in product formation between the non-chase and chase experiment is related as shown in Equation 1. r=P′ chase /P′ non-chase (Eq. 1) where P′chase is the product formed after chaser DNA is added and P′non-chase is the product formed without chaser for the same give time. r is a ratio of the product formed in the chase experiment when compared with non-chase experiment, providing a measure of the enzyme dissociation from the DNA. The processivity profiles were analyzed using the non-linear regression package in Mathematica (Wolfram Inc.). The results were reported as the best fit values ± S.E. The processivity can be schematically described as Every k is a turnover rate constant for methylation, and every koff is the dissociation rate constant for the enzyme-DNA complex. EPi represents the enzyme that has processed i steps, and ES0 is the initial enzyme-DNA complex. ES0 is equal to the total active enzyme concentration in the assay because the enzyme and the DNA concentration are well above the dissociation constant for the enzyme-DNA complex. ES0 is calculated by the amount of total enzyme multiplied by the percentage of active enzyme. The following equations, modified from those described in Svedruzić and Reich (19Svedruzić Z.M. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14977-14988Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), were used.

The processivity probability (p) was determined using p=kk+koff(Eq. 5) The probability for the processive step n is equal to pn=(p)n(Eq. 6) where Pn of 0.5 is equal to n½, which is the average number of catalytic turnovers before half of the enzymes are dissociated from the original substrate. The substrate was poly(dI-dC), and the assays were performed as described for the processivity assay, using the following as chaser DNA: poly(dA-dT) (200 μm bp) and Gusch (short 30-mer with no CpG sites (50 μm molecules)). M.SssI (0.157 units, New England Biolabs) processivity assay was carried out as for DNMT3A other then different conditions due to the faster turnover by M.SssI. Conditions were M.SssI (0.157 units, New England Biolabs, 1.4 nm), 5 μm DNA (poly(dI-dC)), and AdoMet at 8 μm in 1× reaction buffer (New England Biolabs buffer 2). Chaser DNA was pCpGL at 200 μm added at 6 min. Full-length DNMT3A, DNMT3A catalytic domain, and DNMT3L were purified to 85, 90, and 95% purity, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1). The enzyme shows maximum activity on poly(dI-dC) DNA. With this substrate, DNMT3A has a turnover rate constant of 1.2 ± 0.3 h−1, where the turnover rate constant is defined as the maximal turnover rate divided by the active protein concentration. This value falls into the range reported previously for recombinantly expressed DNMT3A of 1.8–1.07 h−1 (5Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol.

Reich N.O. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2010; 498: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Taking this into consideration, the turnover rate constant with poly(dI-dC) becomes 6.7 h−1 (Table 1). During steady-state turnover, the enzyme retains greater than 75% activity over the 4-h methylation reaction (supplemental Fig. 2).TABLE 1kcat values for DNMT3A with different substratesSubstrateFormNo. of CpGSizekcatakcat values were obtained by dividing Vmax values by the amount of active enzyme for each substrate.bph−1poly(dI-dC)Linear∼800∼19005.9 ± 0.3pBR322Supercoiled32943591.5 ± 0.2EFS1Linear859361.2 ± 0.3p21-pCpGLLinear3742750.74 ± 0.16p21-pCpGLSupercoiled3742750.42 ± 0.06ß-ActinLinear35500.38 ± 0.08CDC25Linear32780.40 ± 0.06ODCLinear1412680.43 ± 0.07p15Linear298650.83 ± 0.04p21Linear398080.92 ± 0.06SmarcaLinear215160.59 ± 0.07SurvivinLinear269180.52 ± 0.06XistLinear61170.32 ± 0.05Gcbox2Linear1210.21 ± 0.03a kcat values were obtained by dividing Vmax values by the amount of active enzyme for each substrate. Open table in a new tab The processivity assay determines the length of time the enzyme stays associated with its DNA substrate and the number of turnovers using a pulse-chase experiment. Product formation is measured by the amount of tritiated methyl groups transferred by the enzyme to the DNA in a given time. Our conditions involve a 100–200-fold excess of DNA over enzyme, unless otherwise noted. Thus, each DNA molecule will be occupied by a single DNMT3A enzyme and the enzyme is allowed to carry out catalysis on multiple sites along a single piece of DNA. After the given time periods, the reaction is challenged with a 40-fold excess of chaser DNA (a plasmid, pCpGL, lacking the recognition site for DNMT3A) when compared with substrate DNA. A processive enzyme will continue to methylate the original substrate, and the chaser DNA will have no, or a delayed impact, on DNA methylation. A non-processive enzyme will dissociate after one methyl transfer; thus, after the addition of chaser DNA, the enzyme will bind the excess chaser DNA, leading to an immediate decrease in methylation activity. The effects on turnover with the addition of chaser DNA are compared with the activity of the enzyme without chaser. An additional control has both the substrate and the chaser DNA added to the enzyme at the start of the reaction to confirm that the chase DNA suppresses product formation. In the experimental reaction, chaser DNA is added 20 min into the methylation assay. The change in product formation between the non-chase and chase experiment is given as r (Equation 1) for an indication of how fast the enzyme disassociates from its substrate. An r of 1 indicates that the chase and non-chase have the same amount of product formed, showing no dissociation. An r value of 0 shows that no product is formed after chaser DNA is added, an indication of no processive catalysis. Processivity was also calculated for DNMT3A using kinetic modeling originally developed for helicase processivity studies (30Porter D.J. Short S.A. Hanlon M.H. Preugschat F. Wilson J.E.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14977-14988Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The modeling is based on the shape of the curve for the non-chase experiment, which determines the methylation rate (k) and dissociation rate (koff) (Equation 4). A processivity value (p, Equation 5) was determined from the k and koff rates. The processivity values were used to calculate n½, which indicates the average numbers of catalytic turnovers before half of the enzym"
https://openalex.org/W2018320908,"Although mutations in the parkin gene are frequently associated with familial Parkinsonism, emerging evidence suggests that parkin also plays a role in cancers as a putative tumor suppressor. Supporting this, we show here that parkin expression is dramatically reduced in several breast cancer-derived cell lines as well as in primary breast cancer tissues. Importantly, we found that ectopic parkin expression in parkin-deficient breast cancer cells mitigates their proliferation rate both in vitro and in vivo, as well as reduces the capacity of these cells to migrate. Cell cycle analysis revealed the arrestment of a significant percentage of parkin-expressing breast cancer cells at the G1-phase. However, we did not observe significant changes in the levels of the G1-associated cyclin D1 and E. On the other hand, the level of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) is dramatically and selectively elevated in parkin-expressing breast cancer cells, the extent of which correlates well with the expression of parkin. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that CDK6 restrains the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Taken together, our results support a negative role for parkin in tumorigenesis and provide a potential mechanism by which parkin exerts its suppressing effects on breast cancer cell proliferation.

Mutations in the parkin gene, located on chromosome 6q25.2-27, are a predominant cause of inherited parkinsonism (1Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar). Accordingly, much of the interest in characterizing the function of the parkin gene has been directed toward understanding its role in neurodegeneration. However, aberrant parkin function has also been linked to several other disorders (2Mira M.T. Alcaïs A. Nguyen V.T. Moraes M.O. Di Flumeri C. Vu H.T. Mai C.P. Nguyen T.H. Nguyen N.B. Pham X.K.

Frequently, diminished or absent parkin expression was observed in these cancers, suggesting that parkin may have tumor suppression properties. Consistent with this, microcell-mediated transfer of human chromosome 6 suppresses tumorigenicity in several cancer cell lines (9Trent J.M. Stanbridge E.J. McBride H.L. Meese E.U. Casey G.

Collectively, these studies support the existence of a tumor suppressor gene (TSG) on chromosome 6q and the potential candidacy of parkin as a TSG. However, whether and how the loss of parkin function contributes to the development of cancers are currently not well understood, although one line of parkin-deficient mice exhibits a tendency to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (11Fujiwara M.

Here, we examined a variety of breast cancer cell lines and found that the mRNA and protein expression of parkin are dramatically reduced in these lines compared with normal breast cells. Similarly, parkin expression is compromised in primary breast cancer tissues relative to adjacent normal tissues. Importantly, by means of a wide spectrum of assays, we found that the restoration of parkin expression in MCF7 breast cancer cells, which is otherwise highly deficient in parkin expression, mitigates their proliferation rate both in vitro and in vivo, as well as reduces their capacity to migrate. The reduced proliferation rate of parkin-expressing MCF7 cells is likely due to their tendency to arrest at the G1-phase of the cell cycle, although this phenomenon appears not to be driven by changes in the levels of the G1-associated cyclin D1 and E. Instead, microarray analysis of parkin-expressing MCF7 cells revealed a significant increase in the expression level of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). Consistent with this, we observed that CDK6 protein expression increases in a dose-dependent manner with the levels of functional parkin. This phenomenon is however not observed when parkin is substituted with a mutant that is devoid of catalytic activity or with CHIP, a related member. Interestingly, CDK6 has previously been demonstrated to down-regulate the proliferation of breast cancer cells (13Lucas J.J. Domenico J. Gelfand E.W. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 105-114PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our results suggest a novel relationship between parkin and CDK6 and at the same time, provide a potential mechanism by which parkin exerts its tumor suppressing effects on breast cancer cells. The following antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-parkin clone PRK8 (Covance), monoclonal anti-CDK6 (Abcam), monoclonal anti-Flag peroxidase (Sigma), monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma), FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.). All the cell lines used in this study were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Total RNA was isolated from various breast cancer cells using the RNAeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Subsequently, the isolated RNA was reverse transcribed using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Real-Time PCR was carried out in a Light Cycler (Roche) using the FastStart DNA Master Plus Sybergreen I system (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A pair of parkin-specific primers (Forward: 5′-GGAAGTCCAGCAGGTAGATCA; Reverse: 5′-ACCCTGGGTCAAGGTGAG) were generated for this purpose. Concurrently, Real-Time PCR with a primer pair specific for GAPDH (Forward: 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG; Reverse: 5′-TGCCATGGGTGGAATCATATTGG) was also included in the same run as an internal control. Western blot analysis and cellular localization studies of parkin were performed as previously described (14Wang C. Tan J.M. Ho M.W. Zaiden N. Wong S.H. Chew C.L. Eng P.W. Lim T.M. Dawson T.M. Lim K.L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Human breast cancer tissue qPCR array Panel I plate (OriGene Technologies, Inc, Rockville, MD) was removed from −20 °C storage and allowed to warm to room temperature. Master mix was prepared according to manufacturer's protocol. The stock solution contains 2× QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR master mix, parkin forward and reverse primers, and RNase-free water. 30 μl of PCR pre-mix was then aliquoted to each of the 48 wells containing cDNA, and the plate was covered with adhesive cover sheet. The plate was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min and allowed to sit on ice for 15 min to allow the dried cDNA to dissolve. Real time PCR was done using Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems, and the amplification condition is as follows: activation at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. The Ct value of the PCR products was obtained, and analysis was done. Automated immunohistochemistry was performed on 6 pairs of adjacent benign and malignant breast cancer tissues using the Leica BondTM system using parkin antibody (1:500 dilution). Each breast tissue section was evaluated for parkin immunoreactivity using a semi-quantitative scoring system based on the staining intensity. The immunoreactivity scores (IRS) were calculated as ∑(intensityn × percentage of positive stained cells with intensityn). MCF7 cells stably expressing wild type or mutant parkin (or otherwise containing vector alone) were generated by means of a previously described procedure (15Wang C. Ko H.S. Thomas B. Tsang F. Chew K.C. Tay S.P. Ho M.W. Lim T.M. Soong T.W. Pletnikova O. Troncoso J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Lim K.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3885-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). All positive cell lines used for the experiments described hereafter were maintained in serum-containing DMEM supplemented with 200 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) to prevent extrusion of integrated constructs. A simple population growth assay was conducted by seeding cells to be counted in duplicates at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells in 6-well plates, and subsequently quantifying their number each day for a period of 5 days by means of a hemocytometer. BrdU-based proliferation assay (Roche) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. For soft-agar colony formation, 0.3% agar containing 1 × 104 MCF7-vector or MCF7-parkin stable cells was overlaid onto pre-cast 0.5% bottom agar and allowed to solidify before incubating at 37 °C in a 5.0% CO2 incubator for a period of 21 days. Colonies formed on the soft agar were visualized under light microscopy before and after MTT staining. All procedures involving animals were approved by and conformed to the guidelines of our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 6-week-old NOD-SCID mice were allowed to acclimatize for 2 weeks before the start of the experiment. Each mouse was anesthetized before being injected subcutaneously into the right rear flank with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone (as a control) or containing 3 × 106 MCF7-vector or MCF7-parkin stable cells. Tumor formation in injected mice was monitored daily. Where visible tumor was formed, its length (L) and width (W) were measured, and the tumor volume, i.e. L × W2/2, subsequently calculated. Wound scratch assay was performed according to a method described by Suyama et al. (16Suyama E. Kawasaki H. Nakajima M. Taira K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5616-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells are plated in 35-mm dishes and allowed to grow to about 90% confluency. After which, a wound line was made by scratching the cell layer firmly with a pipette tip. Cells were then washed a few times with PBS to remove debris before recovery in fresh medium. The migration of cells into the wound area was monitored at regular intervals under a phase contrast microscope for a period of 84 h. Migration assay using the Matrigel transwell apparatus (BD Bioscience) was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical significance for all the quantitative data obtained was analyzed using Student's t test (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.001) unless otherwise stated. As an initial effort to characterize the role of parkin in breast cancer, we examined the expression level of parkin in a number of commercially available breast cancer cell lines including ZR75, MDA231, T47D, MCF7, and Hs578T (HST). Consistent with the observation by Cesari et al. (4Cesari R. Martin E.S. Calin G.A. Pentimalli F. Bichi R. McAdams H. Trapasso F. Drusco A. Shimizu M. Masciullo V. D'Andrilli G. Scambia G. Picchio M.C. Alder H. Godwin A.K. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5956-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), we found that parkin mRNA and protein levels are significantly reduced in all of these tumor-derived cell lines compared with normal breast cells Hs578BST (BST) or to the non-tumor derived HEK cell line (Fig. 1, A and B). On the other hand, neither DJ-1 nor PINK1, representing two other Parkinson disease (PD)-linked genes, exhibits a consistent pattern of down-regulation in this spectrum of breast cancer cells (supplemental Fig. S1A). To extend these findings, we also examined the expression of parkin in primary breast cancer samples. Quantitative PCR analysis of 5 identical sets of 48 tissues revealed that parkin expression is significantly lower in tumor compared with adjacent normal tissues (Mean Ct value: normal 35.28 ± 0.30 versus tumor 36.71 ± 0.26), which is in agreement with our earlier observations with cancer cell lines (Fig. 1C). Further, we also examined via immunohistochemical analysis whether parkin protein expression may be different between benign and malignant tissues. Although we recorded no difference in epithelial parkin expression between these tissues, the expression of stromal parkin in malignant tissues is apparently greatly reduced compared with their benign counterparts (Fig. 1C and supplemental S1B). Taken together, our results suggest that the function of parkin in breast cancer cells may be compromised via its down-regulation. To examine the effects of restoring parkin expression in parkin-deficient breast cancer cells, we generated stable clones of MCF7 cells expressing FLAG-tagged parkin (MCF7-PK) or containing vector alone as a control (MCF7-Vector). The MCF7 cell line was selected for this study because it is a widely used in vitro model of breast cancer and also one that is highly deficient in parkin expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Three individual parkin-positive MCF7 clones (5, 7, and 11) were selected for our experiments to minimize clonal variation. Notably, all of these parkin-positive clones express parkin at a higher level than vector control or parental cells (Fig. 2A), but are otherwise similar morphologically (not shown). A simple population growth assay reveals that the proliferation rate of parkin-expressing MCF7 cells is significantly reduced compared with control cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting that ectopic parkin expression in MCF7 cells mitigates their growth. Supporting this, siRNA-mediated depletion of parkin expression in these stable clones reverses the inhibitory effects of parkin on their proliferation rate (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the incorporation of BrdU, a thymidine analogue, in parkin-expressing MCF7 cells also occurs significantly less frequently compared with control cells (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S2A). Because cancer cells are anchorage-independent and have the ability to form colonies in soft agar, we also examined whether ectopic parkin expression in MCF7 cells compromise its ability to generate colonies in soft agar. We found that the number of soft agar colonies formed by parkin-expressing MCF7 cells is dramatically reduced and the size of these colonies also tend to be smaller compared with those generated by control MCF7 cells (Fig. 2D, not shown for MCF7-parkin 7 and 11). The ability of parkin to suppress the proliferation of MCF7 cells appears to be dependent on its catalytic activity, as MCF7 cells stably expressing a catalytically impaired parkin mutant (T415N) do not exhibit any alterations in their proliferation rate relative to control cells (supplemental Fig. S4A). To extend our above findings, we examined the effects of parkin over expression on the ability of MCF7 cells to generate solid tumor in vivo. A flank tumor model (n = 9 for each group), where NOD-SCID mice were injected subcutaneously with parkin expressing or control MCF7 cells, or otherwise with PBS alone, was used for this purpose. Over a period of 4 weeks post-injection, we observed visible tumor formation that progressively increases in size in mice injected with control or parkin-expressing MCF7 cells, but not in those injected with vehicle alone (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. S2, not shown for PBS control). Consistent with our in vitro findings above, we found that parkin-positive clones tend to generate tumors of significantly smaller volume and mass in vivo compared with control cells (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. S2). Taken together, our results demonstrate that ectopic parkin expression in parkin-deficient MCF7 cells mitigate its proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, and strongly suggest a negative role for parkin in breast cancer cell proliferation. We next asked the question whether ectopic parkin expression in parkin-deficient MCF7 cells would influence their migration properties. To address this, we performed a simple wound scratch assay and monitored the re-colonization process for 84 h (3.5 days). From 36 h onwards, we found that MCF7 cells ectopically expressing parkin migrate significantly slower into the scratched area compared with control cells (Fig. 3, A and B). This trend persisted for all the parkin-expressing MCF7 clones until the end of our experiment (Fig. 3, A and B). Clearly, ectopic parkin expression in these cells markedly retarded their rate of migration. To verify our observations above, we repeated our migration assay using the standard matrigel invasion chamber (see “Materials and Methods”). Consistent with our above findings, we recorded a significantly reduced ability of parkin-expressing MCF7 cells to migrate to the underside of the matrigel-coated transwell compared with control cells (Fig. 3C, not shown for MCF7-parkin 7 and 11). Taken together, our results suggest that ectopic parkin expression influences the proliferation as well as migration properties of MCF7 breast cancer cells. Conceivably, the reduced proliferation rate of parkin-expressing MCF7 cells may be due to alterations of its cell cycle program as a result of parkin overexpression. To examine whether parkin affects the cell cycle profile of MCF7 cells, we analyzed the cell cycle profile of control and parkin-expressing MCF7 cells by means of flow cytometry. Interestingly, compared with control cells, a significant number of parkin-expressing cells apparently accumulate at the G1 phase (Fig. 4). In agreement with this, the percentage of parkin-expressing cells at the S and G2/M phases is markedly reduced relative to MCF-vector controls (Fig. 4). Collectively, these results suggest that parkin reduces the proliferation rate of MCF7 breast cancer cells in part, by promoting their arrest at the G1 cell cycle phase. Interestingly, cyclin E, a cell cycle regulator required for the transition from G1 to S phase, has previously been identified as a parkin substrate (17Staropoli J.F. McDermott C. Martinat C. Schulman B. Demireva E. Abeliovich A. Neuron. 2003; 37: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Parkin apparently ubiquitinates cyclin E and promotes its turnover. Moreover, recent studies demonstrated defects in cyclin E proteolysis in colon and brain cancer cells harboring dysfunctional parkin (12Veeriah S. Taylor B.S. Meng S. Fang F. Yilmaz E. Vivanco I. Janakiraman M. Schultz N. Hanrahan A.J. Pao W. Ladanyi M. Sander C. Heguy A. Holland E.C. Paty P.B. Mischel P.S. Liau L. Cloughesy T.F. Mellinghoff I.K. Solit D.B. Chan T.A. Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 18Ikeuchi K. Marusawa H. Fujiwara M. Matsumoto Y. Endo Y. Watanabe T. Iwai A. Sakai Y. Takahashi R. Chiba T. Int. J. Cancer. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We were therefore interested to examine whether cyclin E expression is affected in parkin-expressing MCF7 cells. Unexpectedly, we did not detect an apparent difference in the steady state level of cyclin E between parkin-expressing and control MCF7 cells (Fig. 5A). Like cyclin E, cyclin D1 is also involved in G1 to S transition. Hence, we also examined its levels in parkin-expressing MCF7 cells. Similar to cyclin E, the expression of cyclin D1 does not appear to be significantly affected in MCF7 cell stably expressing parkin compared with control cells (Fig. 5B). Aside from the above cyclin species, we also checked the expression of key mitogenic components that might differ between parkin-expressing and control MCF7 cells. A prime candidate central to mitogenic signaling is Erk (extracellular-regulated kinase), which exists in several isoforms. Another is Akt, whose hyperactivation is linked to several tumor types. Among the Erk isoforms, Erk 1 and 2 are the main downstream effectors of mitogenic growth factor signaling. However, we failed to observe a clear trend in the level of activated, phosphorylated species of Erk 1 and 2 between parkin-expressing MCF7 cells and control cells (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the level of phosphorylated Akt appears to increase, rather than decrease in parkin-expressing MCF7 cells compared with control cells (Fig. 5D). It would thus appear that parkin-mediated suppression of MCF7 cells does not involve changes in the levels or activation of cyclin D1, E, Erk1/2, and Akt. Although the precise mechanism by which parkin mediates the suppression of MCF7 breast cancer cell proliferation remains unclear, we reasoned that parkin likely participates in some cellular signaling events that trigger changes in the expression of specific genes, which in turn mediates its tumor suppression properties. We therefore subjected parkin-expressing and vector-control MCF7 cells to microarray analyses using Affymetrix chips. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots of the data obtained revealed that the gene expression changes in the two groups of cells are significant (not shown); demonstrating that parkin expression in MCF7 exerts profound effects on its transcriptional profile. In these analyses, the most significant alterations are a near 5-fold repression of the gene encoding the cysteine-rich secretory protein LCCL domain containing 1 (CRISPLD1) and a 3.4-fold up-regulation of the gene encoding cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) in parkin-expressing cells compared with control MCF7 cells (supplemental Fig. S3). Whereas CDK6 is a cell cycle-related protein, less is known about the function of CRISPLD1 except that it belongs to the CAP (cysteine-rich secretory proteins antigen 5 and pathogenesis-related proteins) superfamily that has roles in cancer and immune response (19Gibbs G.M. Roelants K. O'Bryan M.K. Endocr. Rev. 2008; 29: 865-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). We next sought to address whether the increased CDK6 transcript levels in MCF7-parkin cells would translate to an increase in protein expression. Consistent with our microarray analyses result, anti-CDK6 immunoblotting of lysates prepared from MCF7-vector and MCF7-parkin cells revealed a significant elevation of the protein in parkin-expressing MCF7 cells, the expression of which correlates well with the level of parkin expression in the various stable clones (Fig. 6A). This relationship between parkin and CDK6 is clearly dependent on the catalytic activity of parkin, as substituting parkin with the catalytically-impaired T415N mutant failed to influence CDK6 expression (Fig. 6B). Similarly, substituting parkin with CHIP, a related E3 member, did not affect CDK6 expression (Fig. 6C). We also generated MCF7 cells stably expressing parkin R275Q and R275W, which are respectively associated with cancer and PD (12Veeriah S. Taylor B.S. Meng S. Fang F. Yilmaz E. Vivanco I. Janakiraman M. Schultz N. Hanrahan A.J. Pao W. Ladanyi M. Sander C. Heguy A. Holland E.C. Paty P.B. Mischel P.S. Liau L. Cloughesy T.F. Mellinghoff I.K. Solit D.B. Chan T.A. Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Neither of these mutants alters CDK6 levels when expressed in the breast cancer cell line (supplemental Fig. S4D). Interestingly, the phenomenon appears unique to MCF7 cells, as CDK6 expression in a different cell line, i.e. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells that ectopically expresses parkin is unaffected (supplemental Fig. S4B). Taken together, our results suggest a hitherto unknown cellular co-regulation of parkin and CDK6 expression in breast cancer cells. Given the recently described role of CDK6 as a negative regulator of breast carcinogenesis (13Lucas J.J. Domenico J. Gelfand E.W. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 105-114PubMed Google Scholar), our results also suggest a potential mechanism by which parkin exerts its suppression on the proliferation of breast cancer cells. In this study, we have demonstrated that parkin expression is dramatically down-regulated in a variety of breast cancer cell lines as well as in primary breast cancer tissues. Further, we showed that restoration of parkin expression in a representative parkin-deficient line mitigates its proliferation rate both in vitro and in vivo, as well as reduces the capacity of these cells to migrate. Collectively, our results strongly support a role for parkin as a TSG. Although a role for parkin in cancers may still come as a surprise to many, the 1.4 Mb parkin gene is located within the common fragile site (CFS), FRA6E, a mutational hotspot on chromosome 6 that is frequently deleted in several tumor types including breast, ovarian, kidney, and liver cancers (20Smith D.I. Huang H. Wang L. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 187-196PubMed Google Scholar). FRA6E, along with other CFSs such as FRA3B, FRA16D, and FRAXB, have been proposed to play a causal role in tumorigenesis and/or cancer progression (20Smith D.I. Huang H. Wang L. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 187-196PubMed Google Scholar, 21Smith D.I. Zhu Y. McAvoy S. Kuhn R. Cancer Lett. 2006; 232: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Notably, the FRA3B-associated FHIT and the FRA16D-associated WWOX genes are commonly deleted or altered in various tumor types. Further, several lines of evidence suggest that functionally, FHIT and WWOX act as tumor suppressors (22Bednarek A.K. Keck-Waggoner C.L. Daniel R.L. Laflin K.J. Bergsagel P.L. Kiguchi K. Brenner A.J. Aldaz C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8068-8073PubMed Google Scholar, 23Druck T. Berk L. Huebner K. Oncol. Res. 1998; 10: 341-345PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ishii H. Dumon K.R. Vecchione A. Trapasso F. Mimori K. Alder H. Mori M. Sozzi G. Baffa R. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1578-1584PubMed Google Scholar). The residence on FRA6E that the enormous parkin gene takes thus immediately suggests its potential association with cancers. Consistent with this, Cesari et al. (4Cesari R. Martin E.S. Calin G.A. Pentimalli F. Bichi R. McAdams H. Trapasso F. Drusco A. Shimizu M. Masciullo V. D'Andrilli G. Scambia G. Picchio M.C. Alder H. Godwin A.K. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Smith D.I. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004; 40: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) as well as a number of other groups have documented parkin gene alterations and concomitant reduction in parkin transcript abundance in a wide variety of cancers that includes breast, liver, non-small-cell lung, and ovarian carcinoma. Here, we extended these findings by showing that parkin expression down-regulation in several breast cancer cell lines is rather specific to the gene as both DJ-1 and PINK1 did not exhibit a consistent reduction in their expression in these cells. Despite a consistent association between parkin expression alterations and cancers, there is currently a paucity of reports that demonstrates robustly the functional consequence of parkin expression restoration in parkin-deficient cancer cells, although a very recent study by Veeriah et al. (12Veeriah S. Taylor B.S. Meng S. Fang F. Yilmaz E. Vivanco I. Janakiraman M. Schultz N. Hanrahan A.J. Pao W. Ladanyi M. Sander C. Heguy A. Holland E.C. Paty P.B. Mischel P.S. Liau L. Cloughesy T.F. Mellinghoff I.K. Solit D.B. Chan T.A. Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) showed that restoration of parkin expression in parkin-deficient glioma cells clearly mitigates their growth. By means of a wide spectrum of proliferation assays that include population growth, anti-BrdU-staining, soft-agar colony formation as well as generation of solid tumors in NOD-SCID mice, we showed here that the restoration of parkin expression in MCF7 cells markedly reduces their proliferation rate both in vitro and in vivo, and significantly slows down their migration. Our results therefore provide further evidence supporting a tumor suppressor-like function of parkin. Mechanistically, exactly how parkin suppresses the growth of MCF7 cells remains to be elucidated. Because parkin functions as a ubiquitin protein ligase, and one of its identified substrates is cyclin E (17Staropoli J.F. McDermott C. Martinat C. Schulman B. Demireva E. Abeliovich A. Neuron. 2003; 37: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) (a G1 cyclin whose accumulation is associated with breast cancer development (25Keyomarsi K. Conte Jr., D. Toyofuku W. Fox M.P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 941-950PubMed Google Scholar)), it is tempting to speculate that misregulation of cyclin E levels in parkin-deficient cells could promote tumorigenesis. However, we did not observe obvious difference in cyclin E levels between control and parkin-expressing MCF7 cells. Neither did we observe a significant in the levels of cyclin D1 between these two cell types. Further, we failed to observe any reduction in growth factor signaling via Erk1/2 activation in parkin-expressing MCF7 cells. Surprisingly, the growth promoting PI3/Akt signaling pathway appears to be up-regulated in MCF7 cells stably expressing parkin. This is intriguing given our observation that parkin negatively regulates MCF7 cell proliferation, although a correlative relationship between Akt activation and parkin expression has been previously reported by others (18Ikeuchi K. Marusawa H. Fujiwara M. Matsumoto Y. Endo Y. Watanabe T. Iwai A. Sakai Y. Takahashi R. Chiba T. Int. J. Cancer. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 26Fallon L. Bélanger C.M. Corera A.T. Kontogiannea M. Regan-Klapisz E. Moreau F. Voortman J. Haber M. Rouleau G. Thorarinsdottir T. Brice A. van Bergen En Henegouwen P.M. Fon E.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Conceivably, a network of other players might be involved in parkin-mediated suppression of breast cancer cell proliferation. In this regard, it is interesting to note that our microarray analysis have identified many interesting candidates whose expression is significantly altered in the presence of parkin expression. Among them is CDK6, whose expression increased by more than 3-fold in parkin-expressing relative to control MCF7 cells. Interestingly, Lucas et al. (13Lucas J.J. Domenico J. Gelfand E.W. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 105-114PubMed Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that whereas normal human mammary epithelial cells contains high levels of CDK6 protein and activity, all the breast tumor-derived cell lines examined exhibit significantly reduced levels of CDK6, with several having little or no CDK6. Importantly, they showed that restoration of CDK6 in breast cancer cells restrained their proliferation (13Lucas J.J. Domenico J. Gelfand E.W. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 105-114PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, NIH3T3 lines engineered to overexpress CDK6 all exhibit reduced rate of proliferation relative to parental control cells (27Nagasawa M. Gelfand E.W. Lucas J.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2889-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is thus attractive to speculate that enhanced CDK6 expression in parkin-expressing MCF7 cells participates to mitigate the proliferation rate of these cells. Notwithstanding this, it is important to point out that the reported anti-proliferative role of CDK6 is non-classic and currently controversial. However, this paradoxical activity of CDK6 is not without precedent. For example, Stat3, a widely accepted oncogene, was shown recently to play a tumor-suppressive role in PTEN-deficient human glioblastoma cells (28de la Iglesia N. Konopka G. Lim K.L. Nutt C.L. Bromberg J.F. Frank D.A. Mischel P.S. Louis D.N. Bonni A. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5870-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It would therefore appear that the physiological manifestation of an oncogene (or tumor suppressor) is dependent on the cellular context. We have attempted to study the effects of CDK6 overexpression in MCF7 cells. However, unlike Lucas et al. (13Lucas J.J. Domenico J. Gelfand E.W. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 105-114PubMed Google Scholar), we have difficulties analyzing MCF7 cells expressing exogenous CDK6 as they detach from cell culture substratum and round up readily (supplemental Fig. S4C), suggesting that CDK6 expression above a certain threshold level potentially promotes apoptosis of MCF7 cells. Interestingly, our microarray analysis also revealed a significant down-regulation of a relatively novel protein known as CRISPLD1, a member of the CAP superfamily that apparently has roles in cancer and immune response (19Gibbs G.M. Roelants K. O'Bryan M.K. Endocr. Rev. 2008; 29: 865-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Although much less is known about the role of CRISPLD1 in breast cancer at this moment, future experiments should help elucidate the relationship between CRISPLD1 and its potential interaction with parkin in mediating the suppression of breast cancer cell proliferation. In essence, our results presented here strongly support a negative role for parkin in breast cancers, which likely involves a novel (albeit currently correlative) relationship between parkin and CDK6.

https://openalex.org/W2170938681,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is one of the most important phytohormones in plant. PYL proteins were identified to be ABA receptors in Arabidopsis thaliana. Despite the remarkably high degree of sequence similarity, PYL1 and PYL2 exhibit distinct responses toward pyrabactin, an ABA agonist. PYL1 inhibits protein phosphatase type 2C upon binding of pyrabactin. In contrast, PYL2 appears relatively insensitive to this compound. The crystal structure of pyrabactin-bound PYL1 revealed that most of the PYL1 residues involved in pyrabactin binding are conserved, hence failing to explain the selectivity of pyrabactin for PYL1 over PYL2. To understand the molecular basis of pyrabactin selectivity, we determined the crystal structure of PYL2 in complex with pyrabactin at 1.64 Å resolution. Structural comparison and biochemical analyses demonstrated that one single amino acid alteration between a corresponding valine and isoleucine determines the distinct pyrabactin selectivity by PYL1 and PYL2. These characterizations provide an important clue to dissecting the redundancy of PYL proteins. Abscisic acid (ABA) is one of the most important phytohormones in plant. PYL proteins were identified to be ABA receptors in Arabidopsis thaliana. Despite the remarkably high degree of sequence similarity, PYL1 and PYL2 exhibit distinct responses toward pyrabactin, an ABA agonist. PYL1 inhibits protein phosphatase type 2C upon binding of pyrabactin. In contrast, PYL2 appears relatively insensitive to this compound.

https://openalex.org/W2086156600,"Posttranslational modifications, e.g. proteolysis, glycosylation, and citrullination regulate chemokine function, affecting leukocyte migration during inflammatory responses. Here, modification of CXCL5/epithelial cell-derived neutrophil-activating protein-78 (ENA-78) by proteases or peptidylarginine deiminases (PAD) was evaluated. Slow CXCL5(1-78) processing by the myeloid cell marker aminopeptidase N/CD13 into CXCL5(2-78) hardly affected its in vitro activity, but slowed down the activation of CXCL5 by the neutrophil protease cathepsin G. PAD, an enzyme with a potentially important function in autoimmune diseases, site-specifically deiminated Arg(9) in CXCL5 to citrulline, generating [Cit(9)]CXCL5(1-78). Compared with CXCL5(1-78), [Cit(9)]CXCL5(1-78) less efficiently induced intracellular calcium signaling, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, internalization of CXCR2, and in vitro neutrophil chemotaxis. In contrast, conversion of CXCL5 into the previously reported natural isoform CXCL5(8-78) provided at least 3-fold enhanced biological activity in these tests. Citrullination, but not NH(2)-terminal truncation, reduced the capacity of CXCL5 to up-regulate the expression of the integrin α-chain CD11b on neutrophils. Truncation nor citrullination significantly affected the ability of CXCL5 to up-regulate CD11a expression or shedding of CD62L. In line with the in vitro results, CXCL5(8-78) and CXCL5(9-78) induced a more pronounced neutrophil influx in vivo compared with CXCL5(1-78). Administration of 300 pmol of either CXCL5(1-78) or [Cit(9)]CXCL5(1-78) failed to attract neutrophils to the peritoneal cavity. Citrullination of the more potent CXCL5(9-78) lowers its chemotactic potency in vivo and confirms the tempering effect of citrullination in vitro. The highly divergent effects of modifications of CXCL5 on neutrophil influx underline the potential importance of tissue-specific interactions between chemokines and PAD or proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1971735190,"The 14-3-3 proteins are a set of highly conserved scaffolding proteins that have been implicated in the regulation of a variety of important cellular processes such as the cell cycle, apoptosis and mitogenic signaling. Recent evidence indicates that the expression of some of the family members is elevated in human cancers suggesting that they may play a role in tumorigenesis. In the present study, the oncogenic potential of 14-3-3γ was shown by focus formation and tumor formation in SCID mice using 14-3-3γ transfected NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. In contrast, 14-3-3σ, a putative tumor suppressor, inhibited NIH3T3 transformation by H-ras and c-myc. We also report that activation of both MAP kinase and PI3K signaling pathways are essential for transformation by 14-3-3γ. In addition, we found that 14-3-3γ interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and TSC2 proteins indicating that it could stimulate PI3K signaling by acting at two points in the signaling pathway. Overall, our studies establish 14-3-3γ as an oncogene and implicate MAPK and PI3K signaling as important for 14-3-3γ induced transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2146173712,"Background Can hearing a word change what one sees? Although visual sensitivity is known to be enhanced by attending to the location of the target, perceptual enhancements of following cues to the identity of an object have been difficult to find. Here, we show that perceptual sensitivity is enhanced by verbal, but not visual cues. Methodology/Principal Findings Participants completed an object detection task in which they made an object-presence or -absence decision to briefly-presented letters. Hearing the letter name prior to the detection task increased perceptual sensitivity (d′). A visual cue in the form of a preview of the to-be-detected letter did not. Follow-up experiments found that the auditory cuing effect was specific to validly cued stimuli. The magnitude of the cuing effect positively correlated with an individual measure of vividness of mental imagery; introducing uncertainty into the position of the stimulus did not reduce the magnitude of the cuing effect, but eliminated the correlation with mental imagery. Conclusions/Significance Hearing a word made otherwise invisible objects visible. Interestingly, seeing a preview of the target stimulus did not similarly enhance detection of the target. These results are compatible with an account in which auditory verbal labels modulate lower-level visual processing. The findings show that a verbal cue in the form of hearing a word can influence even the most elementary visual processing and inform our understanding of how language affects perception."
https://openalex.org/W1987324930,"All chemokines share a common structural scaffold that mediate a remarkable variety of functions from immune surveillance to organogenesis. Chemokines are classified as CXC or CC on the basis of conserved cysteines, and the two subclasses bind distinct sets of GPCR class of receptors and also have markedly different quaternary structures, suggesting that the CXC/CC motif plays a prominent role in both structure and function. For both classes, receptor activation involves interactions between chemokine N-loop and receptor N-domain residues (Site-I), and between chemokine N-terminal and receptor extracellular/transmembrane residues (Site-II). We engineered a CC variant (labeled as CC-CXCL8) of the chemokine CXCL8 by deleting residue X (CXC → CC), and found its structure is essentially similar to WT. In stark contrast, CC-CXCL8 bound poorly to its cognate receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 (K(i) > 1 μm). Further, CC-CXCL8 failed to mobilize Ca(2+) in CXCR2-expressing HL-60 cells or recruit neutrophils in a mouse lung model. However, most interestingly, CC-CXCL8 mobilizes Ca(2+) in neutrophils and in CXCR1-expressing HL-60 cells. Compared with the WT, CC-CXCL8 binds CXCR1 N-domain with only ∼5-fold lower affinity indicating that the weak binding to intact CXCR1 must be due to its weak binding at Site-II. Nevertheless, this level of binding is sufficient for receptor activation indicating that affinity and activity are separable functions. We propose that the CXC motif functions as a conformational switch that couples Site-I and Site-II interactions for both receptors, and that this coupling is critical for high affinity binding but differentially regulates activation."

In this study, the five extrinsic proteins were purified from alkaline Tris extracts of the diatom PSII by anion and cation exchange chromatographic columns at different pH values. Reconstitution experiments in various combinations with the purified extrinsic proteins showed that PsbO, PsbQ′, and Psb31 rebound directly to PSII in the absence of other extrinsic proteins, indicating that these extrinsic proteins have their own binding sites in PSII intrinsic proteins. On the other hand, PsbV and PsbU scarcely rebound to PSII alone, and their effective bindings required the presence of all of the other extrinsic proteins. Interestingly, PSII reconstituted with Psb31 alone considerably restored the oxygen evolving activity in the absence of PsbO, indicating that Psb31 serves as a substitute in part for PsbO in supporting oxygen evolution. A significant difference found between PSIIs reconstituted with Psb31 and with PsbO is that the oxygen evolving activity of the former is scarcely stimulated by Cl− and Ca2+ ions but that of the latter is largely stimulated by these ions, although rebinding of PsbV and PsbU activated oxygen evolution in the absence of Cl− and Ca2+ ions in both the former and latter PSIIs.

https://openalex.org/W2090101918,"The mammalian phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P(2)) phosphatase Sac3 and ArPIKfyve, the associated regulator of the PtdIns3P-5 kinase PIKfyve, form a stable binary complex that associates with PIKfyve in a ternary complex to increase PtdIns(3,5)P(2) production. Whether the ArPIKfyve-Sac3 subcomplex functions outside the PIKfyve context is unknown. Here we show that stable or transient expression of ArPIKfyve(WT) in mammalian cells elevates steady-state protein levels and the PtdIns(3,5)P(2)-hydrolyzing activity of Sac3, whereas knockdown of ArPIKfyve has the opposite effect. These manipulations do not alter the Sac3 mRNA levels, suggesting that ArPIKfyve might control Sac3 protein degradation. Inhibition of protein synthesis in COS cells by cycloheximide reveals remarkably rapid turnover of expressed Sac3(WT) (t((1/2)) = 18.8 min), resulting from a proteasome-dependent clearance as evidenced by the extended Sac3(WT) half-life upon inhibiting proteasome activity. Coexpression of ArPIKfyve(WT), but not the N- or C-terminal halves, prolongs the Sac3(WT) half-life consistent with enhanced Sac3 protein stability through association with full-length ArPIKfyve. We further demonstrate that mutant Sac3, harboring the pathogenic Ile-to-Thr substitution at position 41 found in patients with CMT4J disorder, is similar to Sac3(WT) with regard to PtdIns(3,5)P(2)-hydrolyzing activity, association with ArPIKfyve, or rapid proteasome-dependent clearance. Remarkably, however, neither is the steady-state Sac3(I41T) elevated nor is the Sac3(I41T) half-life extended by coexpressed ArPIKfyve(WT), indicating that unlike with Sac3(WT), ArPIKfyve fails to prevent Sac3(I41T) rapid loss. Together, our data indentify a novel regulatory mechanism whereby ArPIKfyve enhances Sac3 abundance by attenuating Sac3 proteasome-dependent degradation and suggest that a failure of this mechanism could be the primary molecular defect in the pathogenesis of CMT4J."
https://openalex.org/W2147716105,"Bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) and eukaryotic PBP-like domains (also called as Venus flytrap modules) of G-protein-coupled receptors are involved in extracellular GABA perception. We investigated the structural and functional basis of ligand specificity of the PBP Atu2422, which is implicated in virulence and transport of GABA in the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Five high-resolution x-ray structures of Atu2422 liganded to GABA, Pro, Ala, and Val and of point mutant Atu2422-F77A liganded to Leu were determined. Structural analysis of the ligand-binding site revealed two essential residues, Phe(77) and Tyr(275), the implication of which in GABA signaling and virulence was confirmed using A. tumefaciens cells expressing corresponding Atu2422 mutants. Phe(77) restricts ligand specificity to α-amino acids with a short lateral chain, which act as antagonists of GABA signaling in A. tumefaciens. Tyr(275) specifically interacts with the GABA γ-amino group. Conservation of these two key residues in proteins phylogenetically related to Atu2422 brought to light a subfamily of PBPs in which all members could bind GABA and short α-amino acids. This work led to the identification of a fingerprint sequence and structural features for defining PBPs that bind GABA and its competitors and revealed their occurrence among host-interacting proteobacteria."

In order to understand the structural basis for isocyanide hydratase (ICH) catalysis, we determined the crystal structures of wild-type and several site-directed mutants of Pseudomonas fluorescens ICH at resolutions ranging from 1.0 to 1.9 Å. We also developed a simple UV-visible spectrophotometric assay for ICH activity using 2-naphthyl isocyanide as a substrate. ICH contains a highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys101) that is required for catalysis and interacts with Asp17, Thr102, and an ordered water molecule in the active site. Asp17 has carboxylic acid bond lengths that are consistent with protonation, and we propose that it activates the ordered water molecule to hydrate organic isocyanides. In contrast to Cys101 and Asp17, Thr102 is tolerant of mutagenesis, and the T102V mutation results in a substrate-inhibited enzyme. Although ICH is similar to human DJ-1 (1.6 Å C-α root mean square deviation), structural differences in the vicinity of Cys101 disfavor the facile oxidation of this residue that is functionally important in human DJ-1 but would be detrimental to ICH activity.

Isocyanides (also called isonitriles) are a class of organic compounds that contain a triply bonded carbon-nitrogen functional group (R-N≡C). Isocyanides differ from nitriles in that the nitrogen atom is bonded to the organic moiety in the isocyanides. In one resonance structure, an isocyanide has a formal positive charge on the nitrogen and a formal negative charge on the carbon atom. In another resonance form, the carbon atom has substantial carbenoid character and can act as an electrophile in its singlet state (Fig. 1A). Structural and spectroscopic analyses of methyl isocyanide indicate that the linear triple-bonded species is the dominant resonance structure (1Gordy W. Pauling L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1942; 64: 2952-2953Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 2Brockway L.O. J. Am. Chem.

Tetrahedron Lett. 2001; 42: 4845-4848Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As a consequence of these resonance forms, isocyanides are versatile organic compounds that possess both nucleophilic and electrophilic character at the carbon atom (3Sung K.S. Chen C.C. Tetrahedron Lett. 2001; 42: 4845-4848Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Isocyanides are notoriously pungent and typically toxic, and several biologically produced isocyanides with broad antimicrobial activities have been characterized (4Scheuer P.J. Acc. Chem.

Despite the natural occurrence of several cytotoxic isocyanide compounds, only one enzyme has been characterized to date that specifically degrades organic isocyanides. This enzyme, originally named isonitrile hydratase (EC 4.2.1.103), was isolated from Pseudomonas putida strain N19-2 in a screen of soil-dwelling bacteria that could survive acclimatization to medium containing 0.02% (v/v) (∼1.6 mm) cyclohexyl isocyanide (8Goda M.

Previous enzymological studies of ICH have shown that catalysis requires a conserved cysteine residue (Cys101) in the active site, the enzyme is highly selective for isocyanides and will not catalyze the hydrolysis of the corresponding nitrile compounds, and the enzyme has a broad substrate tolerance for organic isocyanides (8Goda M.

ICH is interesting because, in addition to catalyzing the hydration of an unusual class of compounds, it is also a new and poorly characterized member of the large DJ-1 superfamily.

A common feature of proteins in the DJ-1 superfamily is that they contain a highly conserved cysteine residue that is essential for the functions of many of these proteins (10Bandyopadhyay S.

This cysteine typically adopts an energetically strained set of backbone torsion angles and is located at a sharp turn between an N-proximal β-strand and a C-proximal α-helix called the nucleophile elbow (20Wilson M.A. Collins J.L.

In human DJ-1, this cysteine residue has a thiol pKa value of ∼5 and therefore exists as a reactive cysteine thiolate at physiological pH (23Witt A.C. Lakshminarasimhan M. Remington B.C. Hasim S. Pozharski E. Wilson M.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7430-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cys106 in DJ-1 is particularly susceptible to oxidation and forms cysteine-sulfinic and -sulfonic acids during oxidative stress (13Canet-Avilés R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W. Ahmad R. McLendon C.

In particular, Cys106-sulfinic acid is stabilized through hydrogen bonding with a highly conserved and protonated glutamic acid (Glu18), and this interaction also contributes to the low Cys106 thiol pKa value in the reduced form of DJ-1 (23Witt A.C.

Because cysteine thiolates are excellent nucleophiles, some of the uncharacterized DJ-1 superfamily members may be enzymes of unknown function that use this conserved cysteine for catalysis. Currently, the only members of the DJ-1 superfamily with experimentally verified and physiologically relevant enzymatic activities are a subset of proteases and hydrolases (PfpI (30Halio S.B.

ICH does not contain this catalytic triad and thus represents a new activity and type of active site in the DJ-1 superfamily. ICH belongs to a previously uncharacterized clade of the superfamily with several close homologues, as well as possessing weaker homology to transcription factors that are fusions of an AraC-like helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain and a DJ-1-like domain (33Ohnishi Y. Yamazaki H. Kato J.Y. Tomono A. Horinouchi S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2005; 69: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition, ICH and its close homologues are distinguished from most other members of the DJ-1 superfamily by the replacement of the highly conserved protonated glutamic acid (Glu18 in human DJ-1; see above) with an aspartic acid. This substitution suggests the hypothesis that functional diversity has evolved in the DJ-1 superfamily through a subtle modulation of the active site environment of the conserved reactive cysteine in order to achieve different chemical outcomes. This hypothesis, which has precedent in other protein families (34Rakus J.F. Fedorov A.A. Fedorov E.V. Glasner M.E. Hubbard B.K. Delli J.D. Babbitt P.C. Almo S.C. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 9944-9954Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), would help explain the varied functions of characterized DJ-1 superfamily proteins and also provides an example of natural selection capitalizing on the unique reactivity of the cysteine thiol(ate) to achieve functional diversity while maintaining structural parsimony. We have conducted a combined structural and enzyme kinetics study of Pseudomonas fluorescens ICH to investigate the role of the structural environment of the active site cysteine residue in the function of this unusual enzyme. ICH is a homodimer in the crystal and in solution and is structurally similar to human DJ-1 and closely related proteins, and the enzyme active site lies near the dimerization interface. A critical and conserved cysteine residue (Cys101) makes key hydrogen bonds with a protonated aspartic acid (Asp17) and a nearby ordered water molecule that are required for significant ICH activity. Structural changes in the environment of Cys101 disfavor the formation of cysteine-sulfinate (Cys-SO−) that is observed in human DJ-1, although Cys101 is partially oxidized to a cystine-sulfenic acid in the ICH crystal, possibly due to x-ray irradiation. The structure supports and expands upon a previously proposed mechanism for ICH that involves nucleophilic attack by Cys101, followed by the addition of water to the enzyme-linked thioimidate species and release of the N-formamide, although the details of this proposed mechanism require additional study. The coding sequence for ICH was PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA of P. fluorescens Migula strain Pf-5 (American Type Culture Collection number BAA-477D) using primers that incorporated a 5′ NdeI restriction site and a 3′ XhoI restriction site. The ICH gene was cloned between the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of the bacterial expression vector pET15b (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) such that the expressed protein carries an N-terminal, thrombin-cleavable hexahistidine tag. After thrombin cleavage, the final recombinant ICH protein has three vector-derived amino acids at the N terminus (GSH), resulting in a 231-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 24,158 Da. ICH sequence numbering throughout this paper is for the untagged native protein amino acid sequence. All point mutations (D17V, D17N, D17E, C101S, C101A, T102S, and T102V) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu Turbo DNA Polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and appropriate mutagenic primers. All ICH constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon and UNL DNA sequencing core facility). E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) bearing the ICH-pET15b construct was grown in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until the A600 reached 0.5–0.7. Overexpression of ICH was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, followed by 5 h of incubation at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until needed. Frozen cells were thawed on ice and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole). The suspended cells were lysed by the addition of hen egg white lysozyme to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by sonication and centrifugation to remove cell debris. The cleared supernatant was applied to a His-select Ni2+ metal affinity column (Sigma-Aldrich) that had been equilibrated in lysis buffer. The recombinant hexahistidine tagged ICH was purified using Ni2+ metal affinity chromatography according to standard procedures, using 200 mm imidazole to elute bound protein. The eluted protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against storage buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl), and protein concentration was determined using a calculated extinction coefficient of ϵ280 = 15,600 m−1 cm−1 based on the amino acid composition of P. fluorescens ICH. The histidine tag used for protein purification was removed by thrombin cleavage (2 units of thrombin/mg of ICH) at room temperature for 4 h, followed by passage over Ni2+ metal affinity resin to remove any uncleaved protein that retained the histidine tag. Thrombin was removed by passage over benzamidine-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare). The final protein ran as a single band of ∼24 kDa on overloaded Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. Purified ICH was concentrated to 20 mg/ml using a centrifugal concentrator (Amicon, Billerica, MA), supplemented with 2 mm DTT, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. All crystals of ICH were grown at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. For wild-type, C101S, and C101A ICH, drops containing 2 μl of ICH at 20 mg/ml and 2 μl of reservoir solution (24–26% PEG 3350, 200–250 mm magnesium chloride, 100 mm CHES, pH 9.3, or 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6) were equilibrated against 500 μl of reservoir solution. The choice of buffer is significant because inspection of the final electron density maps shows that ICH crystals grown from CHES-buffered solutions contain a molecule of CHES bound in the active site (C101S ICH in this study). In contrast, crystals grown from Tris-buffered solutions (such as wild-type and C101A ICH) have similar morphology and diffraction properties but no bound buffer in the active site. Plate-shaped crystals in space group P21 measuring ∼50 × 300 × 300 μm formed in 1–3 days. D17E and T102S ICH formed prismatic rod-shaped crystals in space group I212121 with approximate dimensions 200 × 200 × 700 μm. For D17E ICH, 2 μl of 24 mg/ml protein was mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution (12% PEG 4000, 240 mm ammonium acetate, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6). For T102S ICH, 2 μl of 17 mg/ml protein was mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution (19–22% PEG 4000, 140–160 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6). In both cases, crystals appeared after 2–3 days at room temperature. All crystals were cryoprotected by passage through six solutions of incrementally increasing amounts of ethylene glycol to a final concentration of 30% (v/v) in the reservoir solution. The cryoprotected crystal was rapidly cooled by immersion into liquid nitrogen. For T102S ICH, x-ray diffraction data were collected at the University of Nebraska Macromolecular Structural Core Facility from a single crystal maintained at 110 K using a MicroMAX-007 rotating copper anode x-ray generator (Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, TX) operating at 40 kV and 20 mA, Osmic Blue confocal optics, and a Raxis IV++ image plate detector. For crystals of wild-type, C101S, C101A, and D17E ICH, diffraction data were collected from single crystals at 110 K at BioCARS beamline 14-BMC at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL) using 0.9-Å incident radiation and an ADSC Q315 CCD detector. In situ annealing (35Yeh J.I. Hol W.G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 479-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) of all crystals was performed by blocking the cold nitrogen stream for 7 s and typically resulted in lowered mosaicity and improved data scaling statistics. Due to the high resolution diffraction of crystals of wild-type, C101S, C101A, and D17E ICH (dmin ∼ 1.0 Å), separate high and low resolution passes were used to record the total dynamic range of the data.

This initial model was subjected to manual editing and then was further refined against the 1.05 Å resolution synchrotron data set in SHELX-97 (40Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr.

All refinements used a bulk solvent correction to allow inclusion of the low resolution data. The final models for all atomic resolution data sets (wild-type, C101S, C101A, and D17E ICH) contain anisotropic ADPs and were refined with riding hydrogens on all atoms except the Oγ of serine, O of tyrosine, Oγ1 of threonine, and Nδ1 of histidine due to the ambiguous hydrogen placement for these atoms. The model for T102S ICH was refined in Refmac5 (41Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Ncb5or has an important function, as suggested by the diabetes and lipoatrophy phenotypes in Ncb5or null mice. To elucidate the structural and functional properties of human Ncb5or, we generated its individual b5 and b5R domains (Ncb5or-b5 and Ncb5or-b5R, respectively) and compared them with human microsomal b5 (Cyb5A) and b5R (Cyb5R3). A 1.25 Å x-ray crystal structure of Ncb5or-b5 reveals nearly orthogonal planes of the imidazolyl rings of heme-ligating residues His89 and His112, consistent with a highly anisotropic low spin EPR spectrum. Ncb5or is the first member of the cytochrome b5 family shown to have such a heme environment. Like other b5 family members, Ncb5or-b5 has two helix-loop-helix motifs surrounding heme. However, Ncb5or-b5 differs from Cyb5A with respect to location of the second heme ligand (His112) and of polypeptide conformation in its vicinity. Electron transfer from Ncb5or-b5R to Ncb5or-b5 is much less efficient than from Cyb5R3 to Cyb5A, possibly as a consequence of weaker electrostatic interactions. The CS linkage probably obviates the need for strong interactions between b5 and b5R domains in Ncb5or. Studies with a construct combining the Ncb5or CS and b5R domains suggest that the CS domain facilitates docking of the b5 and b5R domains.

Ncb5or is found only in animals and is expressed in a wide range of tissues and cells. Human Ncb5or contains 521 amino acid residues and three structural domains. The N-terminal b5 domain and the C-terminal b5R domain are linked by a CS (CHORD-SGT1) domain comprising ∼90 residues (Fig. 1A).

However, Ncb5or is the only member of the cytochrome b5 superfamily known to contain three distinct domains. The function of the non-redox-active CS domain is presently unknown, although its primary sequence is distantly homologous to those in human heat shock protein 20 (HSP20, a co-chaperone of HSP90) and other CS family members (12Garcia-Ranea J.A. Mirey G. Camonis J. Valencia A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).The cytochrome b5 family includes two isoforms in vertebrates, one anchored to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (Cyb5A) and the other anchored to the outer mitochondrial membrane (Cyb5B) (13Lederer F.

Membrane anchoring in Cyb5A and Cyb5B is accomplished by a hydrophobic C-terminal domain. The polar heme-binding domains of Cyb5A and Cyb5B have virtually identical folds with secondary structure elements occurring in the order β1-α1-β4-β3-α2-α3-β5-α4-α5-β2-α6 (14Durley R.C. Mathews F.S.

The structure has been described as comprising two hydrophobic cores separated by a five-stranded β-sheet (16Mathews F.S. Gerwinsky E.W. Argos P. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. 7. Academic Press, Inc., New York1979: 107-147Crossref Google Scholar). All cytochrome b5 proteins contain a redox active heme that is ligated by the imidazolyl side chains of two histidine residues. Heme binds in hydrophobic core 1 (α2–α5) and is sandwiched between two helix-loop-helix motifs. The heme ligands reside in the loops of these motifs, one between helices α2 and α3 and the other between helices α4 and α5 (Fig. 1B). Hydrophobic core 2 contains helix α1, which is located near the polypeptide N terminus as well as C-terminal helix α6. Rather substantial variations on this classic fold have been observed in a variety of b5 superfamily members, including the b5 domains of sulfite oxidase (3Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A.

The amino acid sequence homology of the b5 cores is very high among vertebrate orthologs of Cyb5A (supplemental Fig. 1), among Cyb5B family members (data not shown), and among Ncb5or orthologs (supplemental Fig. 2). In contrast, the b5 cores of human Cyb5A and human Ncb5or share only 31% identity and 52% similarity. In addition, heme ligand His112 in Ncb5or is displaced by one residue relative to the corresponding histidine residue in Cyb5A (Fig. 1B). This suggests substantial divergence of structural and functional properties of these two members of the cytochrome b5 superfamily.Four b5R isoforms have been identified in humans, Cyb5R1-Cyb5R4 (1Zhu H.

These and all other b5R family members belong to the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase superfamily (18Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and contain conserved amino acid residues responsible for FAD and NAD(P)H binding. Microsomal b5R (Cyb5R3) associates with both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and outer mitochondrial membranes via a myristoyl group (19Borgese N. Longhi R. Biochem.

U.S.A. 1988; 85: 7246-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Ncb5or (Cyb5R4), the only b5R isoform in animals that contains more than one domain, is localized to the ER (21Zhu H. Larade K.

Previous studies have shown that recombinant Ncb5or is soluble and that its heme is reduced instantaneously when excess NADH (or NADPH) is present (21Zhu H. Larade K. Jackson T.A. Xie J. Ladoux A.

Kinetic measurements have revealed that human and mouse Ncb5or can reduce a number of artificial substrates in vitro, such as cytochrome c, methemoglobin, ferricyanide, and even molecular oxygen (1Zhu H.

However, recent studies comparing normal and liver-specific Cyb5A knock-out mice have revealed no difference in the SCD index of liver microsomal lipids (23Finn R.D. McLaughlin L.A. Ronseaux S.

Notably, mice lacking the Ncb5or gene exhibit impaired SCD activity and develop early onset diabetes and lipoatrophy (25Xie J. Zhu H. Larade K. Ladoux A. Seguritan A. Chu M. Ito S. Bronson R.T.

Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 53-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ncb5or, not Cyb5A, functions in vivo as an electron donor in the SCD reaction. These discoveries have motivated us to further characterize the structural and functional properties of Ncb5or. Herein, we describe the results of studies with recombinant proteins representing the individual b5 and b5R domains of human Ncb5or (designated as Ncb5or-b5 and Ncb5or-b5R, respectively) as well as one containing both the CS and b5R domains (Ncb5or-CS/b5R). We report a 1.25 Å x-ray crystal structure of Ncb5or-b5, which reveals a heme environment that is unique among known cytochrome b5 superfamily members. We also report kinetic data showing that Ncb5or-b5 can be reduced by Ncb5or-b5R in the presence of excess NADH, albeit much less efficiently than the corresponding reaction in full-length Ncb5or or in Cyb5A/Cyb5R3. Finally, we provide evidence that the CS domain plays a role in facilitating interactions between the b5 and b5R domains.DISCUSSIONThe cytochrome b5 fold was first revealed when Mathews et al. (54Mathews F.S. Levine M. Argos P. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 233: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 55Mathews F.S. Levine M. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 64: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) determined the x-ray crystal structure of the lipase fragment of bovine Cyb5A. On the basis of that structure, the x-ray crystal structure of the two-domain protein yeast flavocytochrome b2, a three-dimensional model of tobacco nitrate reductase, and amino acid sequences of multiple other b5 superfamily members, Lederer (62Lederer F. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 674-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) aptly described the cytochrome b5 fold as an adaptable module. In the present work, this adaptability is highlighted by (i) the low sequence identity between the b5 cores of human Ncb5or and human Cyb5A (Fig. 1B), which results from substantial differences in residues with buried and with solvent-exposed (Fig. 4) side chains; (ii) the absence of a helix in Ncb5or corresponding to C-terminal α6 in Cyb5A; (iii) a distinct difference in polypeptide secondary structure in the vicinity of this second His ligand and the subsequent stretch of polypeptide leading into the central β-sheet in the two proteins (Fig. 3A); and (iv) a substantially larger dihedral angle between the planes of the two axial His ligands in Ncb5or than in Cyb5A (Fig. 3D). It can reasonably be argued that iii and iv in the preceding list are both consequences of the conserved difference in location of the second heme axial ligand in the amino acid sequences of Ncb5or (His112) and Cyb5A (His68) (Fig. 1B and supplemental Figs. 1 and 2).Some of the structural differences described above are almost certainly linked to the divergent functional roles of Cyb5A and Ncb5or. Both proteins have been implicated to function in fatty acid desaturation (22Strittmatter P. Spatz L. Corcoran D. Rogers M.J. Setlow B. Redline R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1974; 71: 4565-4569Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 26Larade K. Jiang Z. Zhang Y. Wang W. Bonner-Weir S. Zhu H. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29285-29291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but more studies are needed to delineate their specific roles. We turn our attention to the differences in His ligand orientations. The dihedral angle between the planes of the His ligands in Ncb5or-b5 is close to the maximum value of 90°, accounting for its very high gmax value in EPR spectra, and is by far the largest among structurally characterized members of the cytochrome b5 superfamily (supplemental Table 2). In fact, it is similar to the largest interplanar angles previously reported for natural heme proteins: heme bL in the cytochrome bc1 complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (50Salerno J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2331-2336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Zoppellaro G. Bren K.L. Ensign A.A. Harbitz E. Kaur R. Hersleth H.P. Ryde U. Hederstedt L. Andersson K.K.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4963-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These and all other previously reported bis-histidine ligated b-hemes exhibiting HALS spectra are known or expected to be located in a membrane-embedded region of its protein, with the heme ensconced in a four-helix bundle exhibiting a left-handed twist (51Berry E.A. Walker F.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2008; 13: 481-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The two His ligands reside in diametrically opposed helices of the bundle, which cross over the top and bottom faces of the heme. To the best of our knowledge, Ncb5or is the only member of the cytochrome b5 superfamily demonstrated to exhibit a HALS EPR spectrum and/or orthogonal His ligands. It differs from other b-type heme proteins in this category in two key ways. First, although available evidence suggests that Ncb5or may be loosely associated with the ER membrane (21Zhu H. Larade K. Jackson T.A. Xie J. Ladoux A. Acker H. Berchner-Pfannschmidt U. Fandrey J. Cross A.R. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Rodgers K.R. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30316-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), its b5 domain has a highly polar surface and therefore probably extends into solvent. Indeed, a solvent-exposed location would seem to be essential for this domain's role in shuttling electrons from the b5R domain to its downstream partner or partners. Second, although heme is surrounded by a four-helix bundle in Ncb5or-b5, the helices do not cross the heme faces and do not exhibit a left-handed twist, and only one of the two His ligands is formally in a helix (albeit the C-terminal residue).Perpendicular histidine ligands are clearly not essential for interdomain electron transfer in Ncb5or, as evidenced by the fact that Ncb5or-b5R reduces its cognate partner Ncb5or-b5 less efficiently than it reduces Cyb5A. The difference in dihedral angle between the His ligand planes in Ncb5or and Cyb5A may instead be important for tailoring the biophysical properties of the two proteins for optimal physiological function. One possibility is that the perpendicular His ligands in Ncb5or-b5 contribute to its substantially more negative redox potential (−108 mV versus SHE) (21Zhu H. Larade K. Jackson T.A. Xie J. Ladoux A. Acker H. Berchner-Pfannschmidt U. Fandrey J. Cross A.R. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Rodgers K.R. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30316-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in comparison with Cyb5A (−9 mV versus SHE) (29Lloyd E. Ferrer J.C. Funk W.D. Mauk M.R. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11432-11437Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This is intriguing in light of molecular orbital arguments suggesting that changing from parallel to perpendicular His ligands should be accompanied by a significant positive shift in redox potential (51Berry E.A. Walker F.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2008; 13: 481-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 66Walker F.A. Huynh B.H. Scheidt W.R. Osvath S.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5288-5297Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Ncb5or-b5 will provide the opportunity to firmly establish the relationship between ligand orientation and redox potential in bis-histidine-ligated heme proteins.An alternative possibility is that the difference in location of the second His ligands in the Ncb5or and Cyb5A polypeptide sequences plays a more important functional role than the difference in His ligand orientations, due to its apparent effect on nearby polypeptide secondary structure. In this context, it is worth noting that the region encompassing ligand His112 through the C terminus of helix α5 in Ncb5or orthologs from vertebrates has a higher degree of conservation than do the other helices in the heme binding pocket (α2–α4; supplemental Fig. 2). This is in contrast to a lower degree of conservation in helix α5 than α2–α4 among Cyb5A orthologs from vertebrates (supplemental Fig. 1). This secondary structure difference, coupled with divergence in primary structure, results in decidedly different protein surfaces in Cyb5A and Ncb5or-b5 in the vicinity of the second His ligand and the adjacent polypeptide, including α5 (Fig. 4).Studies have shown that Cyb5A/Cyb5R3 recognition has a strong electrostatic component involving interactions between negatively charged residues on Cyb5A and positively charged residues on Cyb5R3 (57Strittmatter P. Hackett C.S. Korza G. Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21709-21713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Shirabe K. Nagai T. Yubisui T. Takeshita M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 59Kawano M. Shirabe K. Nagai T. Takeshita M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our ionic strength studies have shown that recognition between the b5 and b5R domains of Ncb5or also involves a significant electrostatic component. In this context, it is noteworthy that there are 11 negatively charged residues in the four-helix bundle surrounding heme in Cyb5A but only eight in the corresponding region of Ncb5or-b5 (Fig. 1B). Mutagenesis studies have been performed by others to replace 10 of the 11 Glu and Asp residues in core 1 of Cyb5A by Ala (supplemental Table 3). Results suggest that only Glu43 and Asp71 are involved in strong interactions with Cyb5R3 (58Shirabe K. Nagai T. Yubisui T. Takeshita M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 59Kawano M. Shirabe K. Nagai T. Takeshita M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 4, both of these residues are near the front of the heme binding pocket, in close proximity to and pointing in the same general direction as the heme propionate group that is thought to be important in Cyb5R3 recognition as well. Notably, the residues in human Ncb5or-b5 corresponding to Glu43 and Asp71 in Cyb5A are uncharged (Tyr88 and Asn116, respectively). Asn116 is an invariant residue among all known Ncb5or orthologs, whereas residue 88 is either Tyr or Phe (supplemental Fig. 2). As a consequence, there is much lower negative charge density near the front edge of heme in Ncb5or-b5 (Fig. 4B) than in Cyb5A (Fig. 4A), the region of each protein likely to undergo the most extensive interactions with the cognate reductase proteins for electron transfer (59Kawano M. Shirabe K. Nagai T. Takeshita M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 67Nishida H. Miki K. Proteins. 1996; 26: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The much larger Km value obtained in our studies for the Ncb5or-b5/Ncb5or-b5R pair than for the Cyb5A/Cyb5R3 pair may therefore have a major contribution from weaker electrostatic interactions. Such a large difference in Km values for these pairs is perhaps not surprising, given that Cyb5A and Cyb5R3 must diffuse through the ER membrane prior to docking, whereas the b5 and b5R domains in intact Ncb5or are held in proximity by the intervening CS domain (1Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H.W. Huang S. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A low Km value for the b5 and b5R domains of Ncb5or might reasonably be expected to impair the ability of Ncb5or to deliver electrons to its downstream partner or partners.On the basis of studies with Cyb5A and Cyb5R3, it can be inferred that the residues most likely to be involved in docking of the Ncb5or b5 domain to its b5R domain are located at the front of the four-helix bundle that surrounds heme. A major difference in this region of Ncb5or-b5 in comparison with Cyb5A is the presence of Trp114, which is invariant among all known Ncb5or orthologs in animals, and the adjacent positively charged residue Arg113, which is invariant among known mammalian Ncb5or orthologs. Both residues have fully solvent-exposed side chains, whereas the corresponding region of Cyb5A is devoid of exposed side chains. Solvent-exposed residues in proteins, if not constrained by structural or functional demand, are more subject to random mutation than buried residues. Our CD and thermal denaturation data indicate that Arg113 and Trp114 do not play essential structural or stabilizing roles in human Ncb5or. It can therefore reasonably be assumed that they are necessary for function. Our mutagenesis studies strongly suggest that Arg113 is not involved in the b5-b5R interaction in Ncb5or. Trp114 appears to play little if any role in this interaction either because the 3-fold decrease in electron transfer rate constant observed for the W114A mutant seems insufficiently large to explain the invariance of Trp114 among known Ncb5or proteins. These conclusions ultimately need to be verified in rapid kinetics studies of full-length Ncb5or and its R113A and W114A mutants. Full-length proteins will also be necessary to examine possible roles of Arg113, Trp114, and other highly conserved Ncb5or-b5 residues in interactions between Ncb5or and its likely downstream partner SCD. This represents a significant challenge, given that SCD is an integral membrane protein. Efforts are under way to develop an in vivo reconstitution system with primary hepatocyes from Ncb5or knock-out mice for this purpose. We prefer this experimental system over the classical in vitro reconstitution for two reasons: (i) the in vivo system reflects more accurately the native desaturation pathway, considering two recent papers that show no major phenotype in lipid metabolism of mice lacking Cyb5A in the liver (23Finn R.D. McLaughlin L.A. Ronseaux S. Rosewell I. Houston J.B. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31385-31393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or in the whole body (24McLaughlin L.A. Ronseaux S. Finn R.D. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 78: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), in contrast to the in vitro data (22Strittmatter P. Spatz L. Corcoran D. Rogers M.J. Setlow B. Redline R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1974; 71: 4565-4569Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar); (ii) The SCD enzyme is an integral membrane protein that is hard to purify in an active form for biochemical assays.The physical interaction between the b5 and b5R domains of Ncb5or is clearly different from that in the Cyb5A and Cyb5R3 complex. The CS domain has been shown to be functionally important to allow the electron flow from the b5R to the b5 domain in full-length Ncb5or (1Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H.W. Huang S. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). When the individual domains are separated and mixed in vitro, Ncb5or-b5R is able to reduce Ncb5or-b5 at a slow rate. The electron transfer in the Ncb5or-b5/Ncb5or-b5R pair requires complex formation involving electrostatic interaction, which may be weaker than those in the Cyb5A/Cyb5R3 pair. Nc5or-CS/b5R selectively reduces Ncb5or-b5 over Cyb5A, in contrast to Ncb5or-b5R, but the presence of the CS domain also retards reduction of Ncb5or-b5. Coupled with the finding that the CS domain does not affect the rate of cytochrome c reduction, this observation leads us to conclude that the role of the CS domain in Ncb5or is more complex than simply keeping the b5 and b5R domains in close proximity. At the very least, the CS domain appears to play a role in mediating docking of the b5 and b5R domains. We are currently working to determine the three-dimensional structure of full-length Ncb5or in order to address this and other questions related to its functions. IntroductionNADH cytochrome b5 oxidoreductase (Ncb5or; also named Cyb5R4, b5/b5R, or b5 + b5R) was cloned from humans as a natural fusion protein containing structural homolog of both cytochrome b5 (b5) 3The abbreviations used are:b5cytochrome b5b5Rcytochrome b5 reductaseERendoplasmic reticulumSCDstearoyl-CoA desaturaseHALShighly anisotropic low spin. and cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R) (1Zhu H.

Ncb5or is found only in animals and is expressed in a wide range of tissues and cells. Human Ncb5or contains 521 amino acid residues and three structural domains. T"

Although the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a stress-activated kinase that can promote either cell survival or death in response to detrimental stimuli, the JNK-regulated mechanisms involved in survival are not fully characterized. Here we show that in response to hyperosmotic stress, JNK phosphorylates a key cytoplasmic microtubule regulatory protein, stathmin (STMN), on conserved Ser-25 and Ser-38 residues. In in vitro biochemical studies, we identified STMN Ser-38 as the critical residue required for efficient phosphorylation by JNK and identified a novel kinase interaction domain in STMN required for recognition by JNK. We revealed that JNK was required for microtubule stabilization in response to hyperosmotic stress. Importantly, we also demonstrated a novel cytoprotective function for STMN, as the knockdown of STMN levels by siRNA was sufficient to augment viability in response to hyperosmotic stress. Our findings show that JNK targeting of STMN represents a novel stress-activated cytoprotective mechanism involving microtubule network changes."
https://openalex.org/W1963697709,"Efficiency of translation termination relies on the specific recognition of the three stop codons by the eukaryotic translation termination factor eRF1. To date only a few proteins are known to be involved in translation termination in eukaryotes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tpa1, a largely conserved but uncharacterized protein, has been described to associate with a messenger ribonucleoprotein complex located at the 3' end of mRNAs that contains at least eRF1, eRF3, and Pab1. Deletion of the TPA1 gene results in a decrease of translation termination efficacy and an increase in mRNAs half-lives and longer mRNA poly(A) tails. In parallel, Schizosaccharomyces pombe Ofd1, a Tpa1 ortholog, and its partner Nro1 have been implicated in the regulation of the stability of a transcription factor that regulates genes essential for the cell response to hypoxia. To gain insight into Tpa1/Ofd1 function, we have solved the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Tpa1 protein. This protein is composed of two equivalent domains with the double-stranded β-helix fold. The N-terminal domain displays a highly conserved active site with strong similarities with prolyl-4-hydroxylases. Further functional studies show that the integrity of Tpa1 active site as well as the presence of Yor051c/Ett1 (the S. cerevisiae Nro1 ortholog) are essential for correct translation termination. In parallel, we show that Tpa1 represses the expression of genes regulated by Hap1, a transcription factor involved in the response to levels of heme and oxygen. Altogether, our results support that Tpa1 is a putative enzyme acting as an oxygen sensor and influencing several distinct regulatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2049490335,"Capping protein (CP) is a ubiquitously expressed, 62-kDa heterodimer that binds the barbed end of the actin filament with approximately 0.1 nm affinity to prevent further monomer addition. CARMIL is a multidomain protein, present from protozoa to mammals, that binds CP and is important for normal actin dynamics in vivo. The CARMIL CP binding site resides in its CAH3 domain (CARMIL homology domain 3) located at or near the protein's C terminus. CAH3 binds CP with approximately 1 nm affinity, resulting in a complex with weak capping activity (30-200 nm). Solution assays and single-molecule imaging show that CAH3 binds CP already present on the barbed end, causing a 300-fold increase in the dissociation rate of CP from the end (i.e. uncapping). Here we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to define the molecular interaction between the minimal CAH3 domain (CAH3a/b) of mouse CARMIL-1 and CP. Specifically, we show that the highly basic CAH3a subdomain is required for the high affinity interaction of CAH3 with a complementary ""acidic groove"" on CP opposite its actin-binding surface. This CAH3a-CP interaction orients the CAH3b subdomain, which we show is also required for potent anti-CP activity, directly adjacent to the basic patch of CP, shown previously to be required for CP association to and high affinity interaction with the barbed end. The importance of specific residue interactions between CP and CAH3a/b was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of both proteins. Together, these results offer a mechanistic explanation for the barbed end uncapping activity of CARMIL, and they identify the basic patch on CP as a crucial regulatory site."

However, the influence of these variations on KD susceptibility, coronary artery lesions (CAL) and response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in Japanese children, who have the highest incidence of KD, is unknown.We used unconditional logistic regression analyses to determine the associations of the copy number of the CCL3L1 gene-containing duplication and CCR2-CCR5 haplotypes in 133 Japanese KD cases [33 with CAL and 25 with resistance to IVIG] and 312 Japanese controls without a history of KD. We observed that the deviation from the population average of four CCL3L1 copies (i.e., <or>four copies) was associated with an increased risk of KD and IVIG resistance (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=2.25, p=0.004 and OR=6.26, p=0.089, respectively). Heterozygosity for the CCR5 HHF*2 haplotype was associated with a reduced risk of both IVIG resistance (OR=0.21, p=0.026) and CAL development (OR=0.44, p=0.071).The CCL3L1-CCR5 axis may play an important role in KD pathogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2075369477,"The main cofactors involved in the oxygen evolution activity of Photosystem II (PSII) are located in two proteins, D1 (PsbA) and D2 (PsbD). In Thermosynechococcus elongatus, a thermophilic cyanobacterium, the D1 protein is encoded by either the psbA(1) or the psbA(3) gene, the expression of which is dependent on environmental conditions. It has been shown that the energetic properties of the PsbA1-PSII and those of the PsbA3-PSII differ significantly (Sugiura, M., Kato, Y., Takahashi, R., Suzuki, H., Watanabe, T., Noguchi, T., Rappaport, F., and Boussac, A. (2010) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1797, 1491-1499). In this work the structural stability of PSII upon a PsbA1/PsbA3 exchange was investigated. Two deletion mutants lacking another PSII subunit, PsbJ, were constructed in strains expressing either PsbA1 or PsbA3. The PsbJ subunit is a 4-kDa transmembrane polypeptide that is surrounded by D1 (i.e. PsbA1), PsbK, and cytochrome b(559) (Cyt b(559)) in existing three-dimensional models. It is shown that the structural properties of the PsbA3/ΔPsbJ-PSII are not significantly affected. The polypeptide contents, the Cyt b(559) properties, and the proportion of PSII dimer were similar to those found for PsbA3-PSII. In contrast, in PsbA1/ΔPsbJ-PSII the stability of the dimer is greatly diminished, the EPR properties of the Cyt b(559) likely indicates a decrease in its redox potential, and many other PSII subunits are lacking. These results shows that the 21-amino acid substitutions between PsbA1 and PsbA3, which appear to be mainly conservative, must include side chains that are involved in a network of interactions between PsbA and the other PSII subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1964081622,"Distinguishing between a fair and unfair tackle in soccer can be difficult. For referees, choosing to call a foul often requires a decision despite some level of ambiguity. We were interested in whether a well documented perceptual-motor bias associated with reading direction influenced foul judgments. Prior studies have shown that readers of left-to-right languages tend to think of prototypical events as unfolding concordantly, from left-to-right in space. It follows that events moving from right-to-left should be perceived as atypical and relatively debased. In an experiment using a go/no-go task and photographs taken from real games, participants made more foul calls for pictures depicting left-moving events compared to pictures depicting right-moving events. These data suggest that two referees watching the same play from distinct vantage points may be differentially predisposed to call a foul."
https://openalex.org/W1963776092,"Active site loops that are conserved across superfamilies of myosins, kinesins, and G proteins play key roles in allosteric coupling of NTP hydrolysis to interaction with track filaments or effector proteins. In this study, we investigated how the class-specific natural variation in the switch-2 active site loop contributes to the motor function of the intracellular transporter myosin-5. We used single-molecule, rapid kinetic and spectroscopic experiments and semiempirical quantum chemical simulations to show that the class-specific switch-2 structure including a tyrosine (Y439) in myosin-5 enables rapid processive translocation along actin filaments by facilitating Mg2+-dependent ADP release. Using wild-type control and Y439 point mutant myosin-5 proteins, we demonstrate that the translocation speed precisely correlates with the kinetics of nucleotide exchange. Switch-2 variants can thus be used to fine-tune translocation speed while maintaining high processivity. The class-specific variation of switch-2 in various NTPase superfamilies indicates its general role in the kinetic tuning of Mg2+-dependent nucleotide exchange.—Nagy, N.T., Sakamoto, T., Takács, B., Gyimesi, M., Hazai, E., Bikádi, Z., Sellers, J.R., Kovács, M.

https://openalex.org/W2037434928,"We isolated oryctin, a 66-residue peptide, from the hemolymph of the coconut rhinoceros beetle Oryctes rhinoceros and cloned its cDNA. Oryctin is dissimilar to any other known peptides in amino acid sequence, and its function has been unknown. To reveal that function, we determined the solution structure of recombinant 13C,15N-labeled oryctin by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Oryctin exhibits a fold similar to that of Kazal-type serine protease inhibitors but has a unique additional C-terminal α-helix. We performed protease inhibition assays of oryctin against several bacterial and eukaryotic proteases. Oryctin does inhibit the following serine proteases: α-chymotrypsin, endopeptidase K, subtilisin Carlsberg, and leukocyte elastase, with Ki values of 3.9 × 10−10 m, 6.2 × 10−10 m, 1.4 × 10−9 m, and 1.2 × 10−8 m, respectively. Although the target molecule of oryctin in the beetle hemolymph remains obscure, our results showed that oryctin is a novel single domain Kazal-type inhibitor and could play a key role in protecting against bacterial infections.

Eggs and larvae of the coconut rhinoceros beetle Oryctes rhinoceros live in compost in warm areas such as Southeast Asia. This beetle has thus developed a self-defense system that includes antimicrobial peptides. Several antimicrobial peptides were isolated from the hemolymph of the beetle: defensin (1Ishibashi J. Saido-Sakanaka H. Yang J. Sagisaka A. Yamakawa M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), rhinocerosin (2Yang J. Yamamoto M. Ishibashi J. Taniai K. Yamakawa M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and scarabaecin (3Tomie T. Ishibashi J. Furukawa S. Kobayashi S. Sawahata R. Asaoka A. Tagawa M. Yamakawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Oryctin (GenBankTM accession no. BAA36402), a 66-residue peptide with three intramolecular disulfide bonds, was found as a hemolymph peptide of the beetle during a search for antibacterial peptides. The function of oryctin has been unclear, because no other known peptide or protein is sequentially similar to oryctin. We took a structural approach to reveal the function of oryctin. First, we determined the solution structure of recombinant 13C,15N-labeled oryctin by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Next, we searched for proteins that are structurally similar to oryctin in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). 2The abbreviations used are: PDBProtein Data BankHSQCheteronuclear single-quantum coherenceMCA4-methylcoumaryl-7-amideMOCAc/Dnp(7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)-acetyl/2,4-dinitrophenylRACErapid amplification of cDNA endNOESYnuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy. The search revealed that oryctin has a fold that is similar in part to that of the turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3), a serine protease inhibitor. We then performed protease inhibition assays of oryctin and found that oryctin inhibits eukaryotic chymotrypsin-like serine proteases such as α-chymotrypsin and leukocyte elastase and bacterial subtilisin-like serine proteases such as subtilisin Carlsberg and endopeptidase K. Therefore, oryctin is a novel single domain Kazal-type inhibitor despite its unique amino acid sequence. Kazal-type serine protease inhibitors usually consist of multiple Kazal domains, each of which has a characteristic disulfide linkage pattern, CysI-CysV (where CysI, for example, is the first cysteine residue from the N terminus), CysII-CysIV, and CysIII-CysVI, as well as a secondary structure consisting of an α-helix and an antiparallel β-sheet. Here, we discuss the structure and function of oryctin by comparing the sequences, the patterns of the disulfide linkages, and the tertiary structures.

The hemolymph of the third instar larvae of O. rhinoceros collected on the islands of Okinawa and Ishigaki, Japan, was collected into an ice-cooled 50-ml centrifugation tube containing 1 mg of aprotinin 24 h after injection of heat-killed Escherichia coli. The hemolymph was centrifuged at 39,100 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was heated in boiling water for 10 min and then cooled on ice and centrifuged at 39,100 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was acidified with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and applied onto a Sep-Pak Vac tC18 column (Waters, Milford, MA) equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) TFA and eluted with 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) TFA. The 40% (v/v) acetonitrile fraction was applied to a PepRPC column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 0.05% (v/v) heptafluorobutanoic acid. The adsorbent was eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile: 0–20% (v/v) in 5 min, followed by 20–40% (v/v) in 40 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The fractions containing oryctin were applied to the same system but using 0.05% (v/v) TFA instead of 0.05% (v/v) heptafluorobutanoic acid. Peptide sequencing was performed using LF3400 (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and Procise cLC492 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) protein sequencers. MALDI-TOF MS was measured on a Voyager Linear spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). About 1 pmol of purified oryctin was dissolved in 1 μl of 0.1% (v/v) TFA. The sample solution was then mixed with saturated sinapinic acid solution in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) TFA directly on the target. The cDNA encoding oryctin was cloned using the following three-step PCR amplification. The fat body was collected 10 h after the injection of heat-killed E. coli. The poly(A)+ RNA was purified from the fat body using a Quick Prep mRNA purification kit (GE Healthcare). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1.32 μg of the poly(A)+ RNA using a First-Strand cDNA synthesis kit (GE Healthcare). Using the first-strand cDNA as a template, RT-PCR was performed using the following degenerate primers: the sense primer O1F (17-mer), whose sequence was deduced from the amino acid sequence of Val1–Asp6 (5′-GTNCCNGTNGGN(AT)(CG)NGA-3′) and the antisense primer O1R (20-mer), whose sequence was deduced from the amino acid sequence of Asn23–Val29 (5′-AC(AGT)ATNCCYTTYTCNGGRTT-3′). A 45-cycle step-down protocol was used: denaturation at 94 °C for 8 min (first cycle) or 30 s (second and following cycles), annealing at 60 °C (initial five cycles), 55 °C (second five cycles), 50 °C (third five cycles), 45 °C (fourth five cycles), or 40 °C (final 25 cycles) for 30 s and polymerization at 72 °C for 30 s. The resultant 86-bp fragment was subcloned into a TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was performed using an ABI Prism model 373A DNA sequencer with the dye-terminator protocol (Applied Biosystems). 3′-RACE was done using the first-strand cDNA as the template, the antisense NotI adaptor primer 5′-AACTGGAAGAATTCGCGGC-3′, and the sense primer O2F (22-mer), whose sequence was derived from the result of Step 1: 5′-CTGTGAACCCAAACTATGCACC-3′. A 35-cycle PCR was used: denaturation at 94 °C for 8 min (first cycle) or 30 s (second and following cycles), annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 30 s. The amplified fragment was subcloned and sequenced as described above. 5′-RACE was done using the 5′-RACE kit (Invitrogen). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the antisense primer OGSP1 (16-mer), whose sequence was derived from the result of Step 2: TTATGGACGTGGTGCA. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase reaction was performed on ice for 1 h. The nested PCR was performed using the antisense primer OGSP2 (24-mer) TTTTTGATTGCTTCTTCACACTCG and the abridged anchor primer. A 40-cycle PCR was used: denaturation at 94 °C for 6 min (first cycle) or 1 min (second and following cycles), annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 1 min. The amplified fragment was subcloned and sequenced as described above. About 1 μg of oryctin was dissolved in 10 μl of 20 mm sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) containing 0.1 μg of lysyl endopeptidase (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) and endoprotease Asp-N (Roche Applied Science) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was applied directly to MALDI-TOF MS. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as the matrix. RT-PCR was carried out as described previously (1Ishibashi J. Saido-Sakanaka H. Yang J. Sagisaka A. Yamakawa M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using the following primers: 5′-AGTTGTGAATTTGTGCCGATACTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATTTGCGACAATTTATTTAAAAGC-3′ (reverse). A 40-cycle PCR was used: denaturation at 94 °C for 6 min (first cycle) or 30 s (second and following cycles), annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 30 s. Oryctin with an N-terminal His6 tag that was cleavable by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (Invitrogen) digestion was expressed in E. coli BL21-Star(DE3) (Invitrogen) grown in M9 minimal medium using a pET28a-based (Novagen, Madison, WI) expression plasmid by adding a final concentration of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation, 15N-labeled and 13C,15N-labeled oryctin with an N-terminal His6 tag was purified with Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). The His6 tag was removed by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease digestion. 15N-labeled and 13C,15N-labeled oryctin were further purified by cation exchange followed by size exclusion chromatographies with Mono S HR 10/10 and Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (GE Healthcare), respectively. Purified 13C,15N-labeled oryctin was dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3 in 90% H2O, 10% D2O (v/v) to a final concentration of 2 mm. All NMR spectra were measured at 25 °C on a Unity Inova 500-MHz spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a triple-resonance probe. The following NMR data were acquired: 1H-15N HSQC, HNCO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, C(CO)NH, H(CCO)NH, HCCH-correlation spectroscopy (HCCH-COSY), HCCH-total correlation spectroscopy (HCCH-TOCSY), 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC. The mixing times for the 15N-edited and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQCs were 75 and 150 ms. All of the acquired data were processed, visualized, and analyzed with the programs NMRPipe (4Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar), NMRDraw (4Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J.

The programs CSI (5Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar) and TALOS (6Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) were used to predict the regions of α-helix and β-strand based on 13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, 1Hα, and 15N chemical shifts. The predicted angle ranges were used as the dihedral angle restraints. Hydrogen bonds were detected by the following HgD exchange experiment. First, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 0.2 mm 15N-labeled oryctin dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 in 90% H2O, 10% D2O (v/v) were acquired. Then, the solvent was changed to 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 in D2O by ultrafiltration using a Vivaspin-20 (molecular weight cutoff 3000; Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Aubagne, France). 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after the solvent exchange. The peak intensities in these 1H-15N HSQC spectra were analyzed. Slowly exchanging amide protons were detected, and their respective carbonyl acceptors were deduced from the NOE data, and the oryctin structures at intermediate stages of the structure calculations. Hydrogen bond distance restraints were set as rHN-O = 1.8–2.0 Å, rN-O = 2.7–3.0 Å. Interproton distance restraints were derived from peak intensities in the 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra of 13C,15N-labeled oryctin with a mixing time of 75 ms. The cross-peak intensities were translated into interproton distances based on the relationship, NOE ∝ (distance)−6; the standard distance between HNi and HNi+1 in the α-helix was 2.8 Å, and the standard distance between Hαiand Hαj in the antiparallel β-sheet was 2.3 Å. Structure calculations were performed using CYANA (7Jee J. Güntert P. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2003; 4: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Two hundred conformers were annealed in 10,000 steps of torsion angle dynamics calculations, of which 20 conformers with the lowest values in the target function were used to represent the solution structure of oryctin. The conformer with the lowest target function was used as the representative structure of oryctin. The tertiary structure was visualized with the programs MOLMOL (8Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29–32.): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and PyMOL (DeLano, W. L.). The five conformers with the lowest target functions were submitted to the Dali server (9Holm L. Kääriäinen S. Rosenström P. Schenkel A. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2780-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) to search for proteins structurally similar to oryctin. α-Chymotrypsin, leukocyte elastase, subtilisin Carlsberg, endopeptidase K, trypsin, papain, and thermolysin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; V8 protease, pepsin, and lysyl endopeptidase were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan); proline-specific endopeptidase was from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan); and endoproteinases Arg-C and Asp-N were from Roche Diagnostics. Peptidyl-MCA substrates (referred to as MCA substrates) and MOCAc/Dnp type fluorescence-quenching substrates (referred to as MOCAc/Dnp substrates) for the above-mentioned proteases (shown in Table 2) were purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). In the case of MCA substrates, the protease activity was measured using fluorescence intensity, where 380 and 460 nm were used as the excitation and detection wavelengths, respectively. In the case of MOCAc/Dnp substrates, the protease activity was measured using fluorescence intensity, where 328 and 393 nm were used as the excitation and detection wavelengths, respectively. The pH-dependent inhibitory activity was assayed as follows. A reaction mixture containing 3.3 nm protease, 10 nm oryctin, and 66, 100, or 130 μm MCA substrate or 6.6, 10, or 13 μm MOCAc/Dnp substrate in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2–9.2) was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and then HCl was added to stop the reaction. Exceptionally, for a reaction involving pepsin, the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 1.0–3.0 with HCl, and the reaction was stopped by adding 3 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The temperature-dependent inhibitory activity was assayed as follows. A reaction mixture containing 3.3 nm protease, 10 nm oryctin, and 33, 66, 100, or 130 μm MCA substrate or 3.3, 6.6, 10, or 13 μm MOCAc/Dnp substrate in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was incubated at 10–70 °C for 3 min, and then HCl was added to stop the reaction. The mode of protease inhibition and the inhibition constant (Ki) values were determined with a reaction mixture containing 3.3 nm protease, 83, 170, 250, 330, or 500 μm MCA substrate, and 0.83, 1.7, 2.5, 3.3 or 5.0 nm oryctin (for α-chymotrypsin, endopeptidase K, and subtilisin Carlsberg) or 8.3, 17, 25, 33, or 50 nm oryctin (for leukocyte elastase), respectively. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and then HCl was added to stop the reaction. The acquired data were plotted on Lineweaver-Burk plots. The kinetics parameters (Km and kcat) were obtained with the reaction mixture containing 3.3 nm protease, 66, 100, or 130 μm MCA substrate or 6.6, 10, or 13 μm MOCAc/Dnp substrate in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 min, and then HCl was added to stop the reaction. This reaction was performed in triplicate. Exceptionally, for a reaction involving pepsin, the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 1.5 with HCl, and the reaction was stopped by adding 3 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).TABLE 2Kinetic parameters, specificity constants and inhibition constants of oryctin and aprotinin for the hydrolysis of MCA and MOCAc/Dnp substrates by eukaryotic and bacterial proteasesProtease (origin)SubstrateWithout inhibitorInhibitorKiKmkcatkcat/Kmμms−1s−1·mm−1nmα-Chymotrypsin (bovine)Suc-AAPF-MCAbZ, benzyloxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; Boc, t-butyloxycarbonyl; MOCAc, 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; K(Dnp), Nϵ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-lysine; and A2pr(Dnp), Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid.110 ± 7.76.2 ± 0.5458 ± 4.7Oryctin/Aprotinin0.39/1.3Leukocyte elastase (human)Suc-AAA-MCAbZ, benzyloxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; Boc, t-butyloxycarbonyl; MOCAc, 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; K(Dnp), Nϵ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-lysine; and A2pr(Dnp), Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid.82 ± 6.10.11 ± 0.0071.4 ± 0.09Oryctin/Aprotinin12/1300Subtilisin Carlsberg (Butilus licheniformis)Suc-LLVY-MCAbZ, benzyloxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; Boc, t-butyloxycarbonyl; MOCAc, 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; K(Dnp), Nϵ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-lysine; and A2pr(Dnp), Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid.64 ± 5.82.5 ± 0.8239 ± 4.5Oryctin/Aprotinin1.4/NIEndopeptidase K (Tritirachium album)Suc-AAPF-MCAbZ, benzyloxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; Boc, t-butyloxycarbonyl; MOCAc, 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; K(Dnp), Nϵ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-lysine; and A2pr(Dnp), Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid.84 ± 9.52.6 ± 0.3531 ± 2.8Oryctin/Aprotinin0.62/NITrypsin (porcine)Boc-QAR-MCAbZ, benzyloxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; Boc, t-butyloxycarbonyl; MOCAc, 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; K(Dnp), Nϵ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-lysine; and A2pr(Dnp), Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid.57 ± 0.295.7 ± 0.19100 ± 5.1OryctinNIV8 protease (Staphylococcus aureus)Z-LLE-MCAbZ, benzyloxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; Boc, t-butyloxycarbonyl; MOCAc, 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; K(Dnp), Nϵ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-lysine; and A2pr(Dnp), Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid.510 ± 520.43 ± 0.0220.84 ± 0.044OryctinNIProline-specific endopeptidase (Flavobacterium meningosepticum)Suc-GP-MCAbZ, benzyloxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; Boc, t-butyloxycarbonyl; MOCAc, 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; K(Dnp), Nϵ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-lysine; and A2pr(Dnp), Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid.130 ± 6.90.041 ± 0.0030.32 ± 0.015OryctinNILysyl endopeptidase (Lysobacter enzymogenes)Boc-VLK-MCAbZ, benzyloxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; Boc, t-butyloxycarbonyl; MOCAc, 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; K(Dnp), Nϵ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-lysine; and A2pr(Dnp), Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid.15 ± 0.70.50 ± 0.04932 ± 2.8OryctinNIEndoproteinase Arg-C (Clostridium histolyticum)Boc-QAR-MCAbZ, benzyloxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; Boc, t-butyloxycarbonyl; MOCAc, 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; K(Dnp), Nϵ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-lysine; and A2pr(Dnp), Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid.190 ± 150.12 ± 0.0090.63 ± 0.090OryctinNIEndoproteinase Asp-N (Pseudomonas fragi)MOCAc-YVADAP-K(Dnp)-NH2bZ, benzyloxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; Boc, t-butyloxycarbonyl; MOCAc, 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; K(Dnp), Nϵ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-lysine; and A2pr(Dnp), Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid.12 ± 0.153 ± 2.04400 ± 230OryctinNIPepsin (porcine)MOCAc-APAKFFRL-K(Dnp)-NH2bZ, benzyloxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; Boc, t-butyloxycarbonyl; MOCAc, 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; K(Dnp), Nϵ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-lysine; and A2pr(Dnp), Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid.11 ± 0.4370 ± 3.134000 ± 980OryctinNIPapain (Papaya latex)Z-FR-MCAbZ, benzyloxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; Boc, t-butyloxycarbonyl; MOCAc, 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; K(Dnp), Nϵ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-lysine; and A2pr(Dnp), Nβ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid.230 ± 160.22 ± 0.0030.99 ± 0.028OryctinNIThermolysinaThe final concentration of 1 μm of zinc ion was added to activate proteolysis.

Open table in a new tab 1H-15N HSQC spectra of [15N]oryctin only, 15N-labeled oryctin-α-chymotrypsin, and 15N-labeled oryctin-leukocyte elastase were measured to investigate the protease recognition sites of oryctin. The final concentrations of 15N-labeled oryctin and protease were 0.2 and 0.4 mm, respectively. The chemical shift change for each residue was determined quantitatively according to the function, δΔ = (δΔHN2 + 0.25 δΔ15N2)1/2 (10Takeda M. Terasawa H. Sakakura M. Yamaguchi Y. Kajiwara M.

Oryctin was found and isolated during the purification of antibacterial peptides from the hemolymph of the coconut rhinoceros beetle O. rhinoceros. About 1.0 μg of oryctin was obtained from 1.0 ml of the hemolymph by four steps of reverse-phase HPLC. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined using a protein sequencer, and the oryctin cDNA was cloned by three steps of PCR using fat body mRNA from immunized larvae. The deduced amino acid sequence from the nucleotide sequence indicated that oryctin contains an 85-amino acid precursor, and a 66-amino acid mature peptide is assumed to be produced by cleavage of the signal peptide (supplemental Fig. S1). There is no sequence similarity between oryctin and any other known peptides or proteins. The MALDI-TOF MS data indicated that oryctin is a monomeric peptide with three intramolecular disulfide bonds and without any other modifications. The molecular masses (m/z) of detected ions after the digestion with lysyl endopeptidase and endoproteinase Asp-N were 1707.57, 1998.21, and 2808.69, respectively, using MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 1). These ions were assigned to the pairs of CysI-CysV, CysII-CysIV and CysIII-CysVI, respectively. An ion with an m/z of 1800.48 was assigned to fragments 3–10 and 42–49, which also indicated the disulfide bond CysI-CysV. Thus, we have concluded that three disulfide bonds are formed in oryctin: Cys7–Cys42, Cys12–Cys35, and Cys20–Cys56 (Fig. 1). Oryctin was constitutively expressed in the fat bodies, hemocytes, midguts, and Malpighian tubules of the third instar larvae. Injection of E. coli into the larvae did not affect the expression of oryctin (supplemental Fig. S2). By using the conventional three-dimensional NMR data, 607 atoms of backbone and side chain 1H,13C,15N were assigned. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of oryctin is shown in Fig. 2A. 100% (57 residues, except proline and the N-terminal residue) of the backbone 1H,13C,15N atoms were assigned. The secondary structure regions predicted by both CSI and TALOS were restrained with the backbone dihedral angle (ϕ and ψ) restraints in the structure calculations (α, Ala36–Gln43 and Gln55–Lys61; β, His19–Leu22 and Val29–Val31). Three hydrogen bonds (Phe21 HN–Val29 O, Val29 HN–Phe21 O, and Val31-HN–His19 O) were assigned based on the low HgD exchange rates of amide protons and the oryctin structures at intermediate stages of structure calculations. A diagram showing secondary structures, hydrogen bonds, and interstrand NOEs is shown in Fig. 2B. The three-dimensional structure of oryctin was calculated based on 552 NOE-derived distance restraints, three disulfide bond restraints (nine distance restraints), three hydrogen bond restraints (12 distance restraints), and 79 dihedral angle (38ϕ and 41ψ) restraints. A total of 200 structures were calculated, and the 20 structures with the lowest target functions were selected as an ensemble representing the solution structure of oryctin (Fig. 2C). The restraints used and the structural statistics for the final structure are summarized in Table 1. The oryctin molecule consists of a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β1, His19–Leu22; β2, Ile28–Val31) and two α-helices (α1, Gly34–Gln43; α2, His54–Asn62). Three disulfide bonds were formed at Cys7–Cys42, Cys12–Cys35, and Cys20–Cys56. The pairwise root mean square deviations for backbone and all non-hydrogen atoms were 0.79 ± 0.17 Å and 1.43 ± 0.21 Å, respectively, among the 20 structures excluding five N- and five C-terminal residues. A representative structure with the lowest target function value is shown in Fig. 3A. The central β-sheet is rich in hydrophobic residues (His19, Cys20, Phe21, Leu22, Ile28, Val29, Val30, and Val31). The hydrophobic residues on the β-sheet and on the α-helices (α1, Ala36, Leu37, and Tyr40; α2, Cys56, Ala59, and Asn62) form a hydrophobic cluster and contribute to conformational stabilization. The Cys20–Cys56 disulfide bond is included in the hydrophobic cluster.TABLE 1Statistics for the 20 NMR structures of oryctinRestraints Distance restraints derived from NOEsAll552Intraresidual (|i − j| = 0)117Sequential (|i − j| = 1)226Medium range (2 ≤ |i − j| ≤ 5)116Long range (|i − j| > 6)103 Hydrogen bond restraintsaThree hydrogen bonds each with four distance restraints.12 Disulfide bond restraintsbThree disulfide bonds each with three distance restraints.9 Dihedral angle restraints ϕ38 ψ41Ramachandran plot (no. of residues/%) Most favored815/76.9 Additionally allowed228/21.5 Generously allowed15/1.4 Disallowed2/0.2r.m.s.d. of atomic coordinatescr.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.

Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2780-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) showed that oryctin is structurally similar to the third domain of OMTKY3 (turkey ovomucoid inhibitor) (Fig. 3B; root mean square deviation = 3.2 and 3.0 Å for 41 and 39 Cα pairs, respectively; PDB codes 1PPF and 1YU6, respectively), which is a Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor. Despite the lack of amino acid sequence similarity between them, their patterns of three disulfide bridges are the same: CysI-CysV, CysII-CysIV and CysIII-CysVI (supplemental Fig. S3A). Oryctin, consisting of 66 residues, has three intramolecular disulfide bonds (Cys7–Cys42, Cys12–Cys35, and Cys20–Cys56), and OMTKY3, consisting of 51 residues, also has three intramolecular disulfide bonds (Cys8–Cys38, Cys16–Cys35, and Cys24–Cys56). In terms of secondary structure, oryctin has two α-helices and two β-strands, whereas OMTKY3 has one α-helix and three β-strands. Both oryctin and OMTKY3 possess a backbone fold similar to those of Kazal-type inhibitors: a central α-helix and an antiparallel β-sheet. The structural difference between oryctin and OMTKY3 is largest in the C-terminal regions, where oryctin has an amphipathic α-helix, whereas OMTKY3 has a short β-strand. The amino acid sequence of the reactive site loop (P4-P3-P2-P1-P1′) including CysII of OMTKY3 is AlaP4-CysP3(II)-ThrP2-LeuP1-GluP1′, whereas that of oryctin is LeuP4-CysP3(II)-ThrP2-MetP1-AspP1′ (shown in purple in Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that oryctin also could function as a serine protease inhibitor. Supplemental Fig. S4 shows the pH-dependent inhibitory activity of oryctin against eukaryotic and bacterial proteases. Oryctin inhibited the eukaryotic serine proteases α-chymotrypsin and leukocyte elastase and the bacterial serine proteases subtilisin Carlsberg and endopeptidase K over a pH range of 7.2–9.2, indicating it acts as a serine protease inhibitor in the beetle hemolymph. Fig. 4 shows the temperature-dependent inhibitory activity of oryctin against the above-mentioned four proteases, demonstrating that oryctin has inhibitory activity in a temperature range of 10–70 °C against the four proteases in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Based on Lineweaver-Burk plots, oryctin inhibited α-chymotrypsin, endopeptidase K, subtilisin Carlsberg, and leukocyte elastase in a competitive manner with Ki values of 3.9 × 10−10 m, 6.2 × 10−10 m, 1.4 × 10−9 m, and 1.2 × 10−8 m, respectively (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5A–D, Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis of the inhibitory activity of oryctin against α-chymotrypsin (A), leukocyte elastase (B), subtilisin Carlsberg (C), and endopeptidase K (D). The inhibition constant (Ki) values against α-chymotrypsin, leukocyte elastase, subtilisin Carlsberg, and endopeptidase K were 3.9 × 10−10 m, 1.2 × 10−8 m, 1.4 × 10−9 m, and 6.2 × 10−10 m, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled oryctin only and 15N-labeled oryctin-α-chymotrypsin showed similar distribution patterns of NMR signals. Chemical shift changes of oryctin by binding α-chymotrypsin and leukocyte elastase were evaluated quantitatively with the formula δΔ = (δΔHN2 + 0.25 δΔ15N2)1/2 (10Takeda M. Terasawa H. Sakakura M.

In the case of α-chymotrypsin binding (Fig. 6A), His19, Cys20, Gly33, Gly34, Leu50, and His54 exhibited large chemical shift changes (> 0.06 ppm); Thr13, Val31, His32, Ala36, Lys49, Gly51, Tyr52, and Glu58 exhibited moderate chemical shift changes (0.04–0.06 ppm); and Asp15, Val17, Val29, Val30, Ser38, Glu48, Glu55, Glu57, Ile60, Asn62, and Ala63 exhibited small chemical shift changes (0.02–0.04 ppm). The residues with degenerated or invisible signals are not colored in this figure (Val1, Val3, Asp6, Lys10, Ile28, Cys35, and Lys37), nor are prolines (positions 2, 9, 18, 24, 45, 64, and 66). In the case of leukocyte elastase binding (Fig. 6B), His19, Leu50, His54, and Glu55 exhibited large chemical shift changes (> 0.06 ppm); Cys20, Val31, Gly33, Gly34, Tyr52, and Cys60 exhibited moderate chemical shift changes (0.04–0.06 ppm); and Cys7, Cys12, Thr13, Met14, Val17, Phe21, Val29, His32, Ala36, Glu48, Lys49, Gly51, Thr53, Glu57, and Ala63 exhibited small chemical shift changes (0.02–0.04 ppm). Degenerated or invisible signals are not colored in this figure (Val1, Val3, Asp6, Lys10, Asp15, Ile28, Cys35, Lys37, and Glu58), nor are prolines (positions 2, 9, 18, 24, 45, 64, and 66). The amino acid residues whose chemical shifts were perturbed by the addition of α-chymotrypsin and/or leukocyte elastase are mostly common and located in three regions of the sequence (Fig. 6, A and B): (i) the putative reactive site near the N terminus (residues 13–20 and 12–21 in the cases of α-chymotrypsin and leukocyte elastase binding, respectively), (ii) the central part (residues 29–38 and 29–36), and (iii) the C-terminal part (residues 48–63 in both cases). When these residues are mapped on the oryctin structure, they form a circle around the molecule like a belt (Fig. 6, C and D). Because the similar surface areas of oryctin show chemical shift perturbations through the binding of oryctin to α-chymotrypsin or leukocyte elastase, oryctin should recognize these serine proteases in a very similar manner. The crystal structures of OMTKY3 bound to α-chymotrypsin and leukocyte elastase have already been solved (PDB codes 1CHO and 1PPF, respectively) (11Fujinaga M. Sielecki A.R. Read R.J. Ardelt W. Laskowski Jr., M. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 397-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12Bode W. Wei A.Z. Huber R. Meyer E. Travis J. Neumann S. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2453-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S5). OMTKY3 binds α-chymotrypsin and leukocyte elastase through its reactive site loop. The only sequentially similar segment between OMTKY3 and oryctin (15ACTLE19 in OMTKY3 and 11LCTMD15 in oryctin) is located in the active site loop of OMTKY3 and the corresponding loop in oryctin. Because oryctin inhibits chymotrypsin- and subtilisin-like family proteases in a competitive manner (Fig. 5), it should exhibit an inhibition mechanism similar to that of OMTKY3 by using the sequentially similar segment within the putative reactive site loop. Based on the crystal structure of OMTKY3 bound to α-chymotrypsin and leukocyte elastase, we have constructed a binding model of oryctin to α-chymotrypsin and leukocyte elastase (Fig. 7, A and B). In this model, not only the reactive site loop region but also the C-terminal α-helix uniquely found in oryctin is involved in the protease binding, which can cause a change in the orientation of the α-helix. This is consistent with the fact that the chemical shifts of most residues in the C-terminal α-helix are perturbed (> 0.02 ppm) by binding to the target proteases, although the chemical shift of the putative P1 residue, Met14, is not perturbed. α-Chymotrypsin and leukocyte elastase have large and small hydrophobic substrate-binding (S1) pockets and thus prefer large and small hydrophobic residues at the P1 position, respectively (Fig. 7, C and D). This explains why oryctin with Met at the P1 position inhibits α-chymotrypsin (Ki = 3.9 × 10−10 m) more tightly than leukocyte elastase (Ki = 1.2 × 10−8 m). The large S1 pocket of α-chymotrypsin will fit to the large hydrophobic side chain of Met14 at the P1 position, but the small S1 pocket of leukocyte elastase will be too small to accommodate the Met side chain. In contrast, OMTKY3 with Leu at the P1 position can bind both α-chymotrypsin and leukocyte elastase very tightly, with Kd values of 5.5 × 10−12 m and 2.4 × 10−11 m, respectively (11Fujinaga M. Sielecki A.R. Read R.J. Ardelt W. Laskowski Jr., M. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 397-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 13Baker B.M. Murphy K.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), because the small side chain of Leu at the P1 position can be accommodated in both the S1 pockets of α-chymotrypsin and leukocyte elastase. Oryctin and the reported Kazal-type inhibitors that contain three disulfide bonds show no sequence similarity, indicating that oryctin and the other Kazal-type inhibitors have evolved convergently, whereas all of the Kazal-type inhibitors except oryctin have evolved divergently (supplemental Table S1 and supplemental Fig. S3B). In fact, the phylogenetic analysis of all the Kazal-type inhibitors in supplemental Table S1 except oryctin can be performed without error using the Phylogeny.fr server (supplemental Fig. S6) (14Dereeper A. Guignon V. Blanc G. Audic S. Buffet S. Chevenet F. Dufayard J.F. Guindon S. Lefort V. Lescot M. Claverie J.M. Gascuel O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar), but that with oryctin results in an error. Supplemental Table S1 compares the number of residues among six cysteine residues (CysI-Xna-CysII-Xnb-CysIII-Xnc-CysIV-Xnd-CysV-Xnd-CysVI). The putative reactive site loop (LeuP4-CysP3(II)-ThrP2-MetP1-AspP1′) of oryctin contains CysP3(II). MetP1, probably the most important for the inhibitory activity, is located between CysII and CysIII. The number of residues between CysII and CysIII (seven) is strictly conserved in all the members, including oryctin, with the exception of the second domain of rhodniin (15Friedrich T. Kröger B. Bialojan S. Lemaire H.G. Höffken H.W. Reuschenbach P. Otte M. Dodt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16216-16222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains eight amino acid residues in that region. The number of residues between CysII and CysIII yields insight into the functional characterization of the Kazal-type inhibitors. Interestingly, there are more residues between CysI and CysII in vertebrate inhibitors than in invertebrate ones (supplemental Table S1). The lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI) isolated from human blood ultrafiltrate, which consists of 15 Kazal domains, contains longer sequence stretches of 12–13 residues between CysI and CysII (16Lauber T. Schulz A. Schweimer K. Adermann K. Marx U.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This may imply that the N-terminal region of the Kazal-type inhibitors in higher animals played some additional role in the course of evolution. Proteases and protease inhibitors are involved in the metabolism, immunity, and metamorphosis of insects (17Kanost M.R. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 18Natori S. Shiraishi H. Hori S. Kobayashi A. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In particular, hemolymph proteases and protease inhibitors are involved in immune responses in insects, e.g. antimicrobial peptide induction, prophenoloxidase activation, hemolymph coagulation, and protection against virulence-related microbial proteases (17Kanost M.R. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1999; 23: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that oryctin inhibits subtilisin-like serine proteases such as subtilisin Carlsberg and endopeptidase K. This suggests that oryctin is also involved in protection against microbial proteases. In the silkworm Bombyx mori, a protease inhibitor against fungal protease was isolated and is considered to play a role in innate immunity (19Eguchi M. Itoh M. Nishino K. Shibata H. Tanaka T. Kamei-Hayashi K. Hara S. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although further investigation is required to reveal the in vivo function(s) of oryctin, the results obtained in this study indicate that oryctin is a novel and unique member of Kazal-type serine protease inhibitors. Despite the lack of sequence similarity, oryctin exhibits a similar linkage pattern of three disulfide bonds and an inhibition mechanism similar to that of the traditional Kazal-type inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W1972623000,"Neuronally enriched RGS4 plays a critical role attenuating G protein signaling in brain, although the mechanisms regulating RGS4 expression are unknown. Here we describe a novel mechanism for transcriptional activation of RGS4 in neuron-like PC6 cells, where RGS4 is markedly induced during confluence-induced growth arrest. Transcriptional activation of RGS4 in confluent PC6 cells was accompanied by impaired G(i/o)-dependent MAPK activation. In the human RGS4 gene promoter, we identified three phylogenetically conserved cis-elements: an inverted CCAAT box element (ICE), a cAMP response element, and a B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6)-binding site. The ICE and the cAMP response element mediate activation, and the Bcl6 site mediates repression of RGS4 transcription. Activation of RGS4 transcription in confluent PC6 cells is accompanied by increases in NF-YA and C/EBPβ and decreases in Bcl6 levels in the nucleus. Increases in NF-YA and C/EBPβ lead to their increased binding to the RGS4 promoter in vivo, and dominant negative forms of these proteins repressed RGS4 promoter activity. Acetylation of NF-YA and Bcl6 were increased in postconfluent cells. Trichostatin A stimulation of RGS4 promoter activity, accompanied by increased binding of NF-YA and decreased binding of Bcl6 to the promoter, was abolished by mutation of the ICE and enhanced by mutation of the Bcl6 site. These findings demonstrate a dynamic and coordinated regulation of nuclear levels and acetylation status of trans-acting factors critical in determining the off/on state of the RGS4 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2137193694,"There is no better example of a relentless attack on evidence-based biomedical research and the integrity of outstanding scientists than that associated with the treatment of a poorly defined condition called “chronic Lyme disease.” Here, a scientifically naive general population, the lay press, and legislators, who in most instances are unable to evaluate and judge scientific evidence properly, have been misled by patient advocate groups to believe that extended antibiotic therapy is the best and only solution to this condition. This has resulted in the unprecedented intrusion of government and the legal systems into the practice of medicine and scientific research. Because there is no clinical evidence that this condition is due to a persistent infection, advocating extended antibiotic therapy is not justified and has been shown to be harmful and of no benefit.—Baker, P. J. Chronic Lyme disease: in defense of the scientific enterprise. FASEB J. 24, 4175–4177 (2010). www.fasebj.org"

https://openalex.org/W2095557891,"Telomeric regions of mammalian chromosomes contain suppressive TTAGGG motifs that inhibit several proinflammatory and Th1-biased immune responses. Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) expressing suppressive motifs can reproduce the down-regulatory activity of mammalian telomeric repeats and have proven effective in the prevention and treatment of several autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. Endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) is an established animal model of acute ocular inflammation induced by LPS administration. Augmented expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as TNFalpha, IL-6, and MCP1 and bactericidal nitric oxide production mediated by LPS contribute to the development of EIU. Suppressing these mediators using agents that are devoid of undesirable systemic side effects may help prevent the development of EIU. This study demonstrates the selective down-regulatory role of suppressive ODN after (i) local or (ii) systemic treatment in EIU-induced rabbits and mice. Our results indicate that suppressive ODN down-regulate at both the transcript and protein levels of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as nitric oxide and co-stimulatory surface marker molecules when administrated prior to, simultaneously with, or even after LPS challenge, thereby significantly reducing ocular inflammation in both rabbit and mouse eyes. These findings strongly suggest that suppressive ODN is a potent candidate for the prevention of uveitis and could be applied as a novel DNA-based immunoregulatory agent to control other autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases."
