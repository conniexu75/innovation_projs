https://openalex.org/W2122483069,"Chronic activation of the immune system is a hallmark of progressive HIV infection and better predicts disease outcome than plasma viral load, yet its etiology remains obscure. Here we show that circulating microbial products, probably derived from the gastrointestinal tract, are a cause of HIV-related systemic immune activation. Circulating lipopolysaccharide, which we used as an indicator of microbial translocation, was significantly increased in chronically HIV-infected individuals and in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques (P ≤ 0.002). We show that increased lipopolysaccharide is bioactive in vivo and correlates with measures of innate and adaptive immune activation. Effective antiretroviral therapy seemed to reduce microbial translocation partially. Furthermore, in nonpathogenic SIV infection of sooty mangabeys, microbial translocation did not seem to occur. These data establish a mechanism for chronic immune activation in the context of a compromised gastrointestinal mucosal surface and provide new directions for therapeutic interventions that modify the consequences of acute HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2131686384,"Microglia are primary immune sentinels of the CNS. Following injury, these cells migrate or extend processes toward sites of tissue damage. CNS injury is accompanied by release of nucleotides, serving as signals for microglial activation or chemotaxis. Microglia express several purinoceptors, including a G(i)-coupled subtype that has been implicated in ATP- and ADP-mediated migration in vitro. Here we show that microglia from mice lacking G(i)-coupled P2Y(12) receptors exhibit normal baseline motility but are unable to polarize, migrate or extend processes toward nucleotides in vitro or in vivo. Microglia in P2ry(12)(-/-) mice show significantly diminished directional branch extension toward sites of cortical damage in the living mouse. Moreover, P2Y(12) expression is robust in the 'resting' state, but dramatically reduced after microglial activation. These results imply that P2Y(12) is a primary site at which nucleotides act to induce microglial chemotaxis at early stages of the response to local CNS injury."

https://openalex.org/W2145791439,"Homeostatic signaling systems are thought to interface with the mechanisms of neural plasticity to achieve stable yet flexible neural circuitry. However, the time course, molecular design, and implementation of homeostatic signaling remain poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that a homeostatic increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter release can be induced within minutes following postsynaptic glutamate receptor blockade. The rapid induction of synaptic homeostasis is independent of new protein synthesis and does not require evoked neurotransmission, indicating that a change in the efficacy of spontaneous quantal release events is sufficient to trigger the induction of synaptic homeostasis. Finally, both the rapid induction and the sustained expression of synaptic homeostasis are blocked by mutations that disrupt the pore-forming subunit of the presynaptic Ca(V)2.1 calcium channel encoded by cacophony. These data confirm the presynaptic expression of synaptic homeostasis and implicate presynaptic Ca(V)2.1 in a homeostatic retrograde signaling system."
https://openalex.org/W2021767025,"We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy applied to deeply underdoped cuprate superconductors Bi2Sr2(Ca,Y)Cu2O8 (Bi2212) to reveal the presence of two distinct energy gaps exhibiting different doping dependence. One gap, associated with the antinodal region where no coherent peak is observed, increases with underdoping - a behavior known for more than a decade and considered as the general gap behavior in the underdoped regime. The other gap, associated with the near nodal regime where a coherent peak in the spectrum can be observed, does not increase with less doping - a behavior not observed in the single particle spectra before. We propose a two-gap scenario in momentum space that is consistent with other experiments and may contain important information on the mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity."

Studies addressing how Peri A PKA sites regulate adipocyte lipolysis have relied on non-adipocyte cell models, which express neither adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the rate-limiting enzyme for triglyceride catabolism in mice, nor the “downstream” lipase, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). ATGL and HSL are robustly expressed by adipocytes that we generated from murine embryonic fibroblasts of perilipin knock-out mice. Adenoviral expression of Peri A PKA site mutants in these cells reveals that mutation of serine 517 alone is sufficient to abrogate 95% of PKA (forskolin)-stimulated fatty acid (FA) and glycerol release. Moreover, a “phosphomimetic” (aspartic acid) substitution at serine 517 enhances PKA-stimulated FA release over levels obtained with wild type Peri A. Studies with ATGL-and HSL-directed small hairpin RNAs demonstrate that 1) ATGL activity is required for all PKA-stimulated FA and glycerol release in murine embryonic fibroblast adipocytes and 2) all PKA-stimulated FA release in the absence of HSL activity requires serine 517 phosphorylation. These results provide the first demonstration that Peri A regulates ATGL-dependent lipolysis and identify serine 517 as the Peri A PKA site essential for this regulation. The contributions of other PKA sites to PKA-stimulated lipolysis are manifested only in the presence of phosphorylated or phosphomimetic serine 517.

The ability of PKA to stimulate adipocyte lipolysis is mediated in large part by the LD-associated phosphoprotein perilipin (Peri) (1Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Hlavin E.M. Kimmel A.R. Londos C.

In the absence of hormonal stimulation (i.e. basal state), Peri A functions to sequester lipases from stored neutral lipid, thereby maintaining a low rate of constitutive lipolysis. After phosphorylation by PKA, Peri A facilitates lipase accessibility to lipid stores, thereby promoting lipolysis (12Brasaemle D. Rubin B. Harten I. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A. Londos C. J. Biol.

ATGL is the “initiator” lipase, with TAG-selective acylhydrolase activity and limited activity toward DAG. The DAG generated by ATGL action on TAG is then hydrolyzed to (additional) FAs and glycerol by HSL, which is suggested to be more effective as a DAG hydrolase than as a TAG hydrolase (24Zimmermann R.

To our knowledge, no study has examined Peri A-dependent regulation of ATGL lipolytic action. Peri A contains six consensus PKA sites (serine residues) (30Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A.

Notwithstanding these limitations, ectopic expression of Peri A PKA site mutants and HSL in these models suggests that PKA-stimulated lipolysis mediated by (ectopic) HSL requires phosphorylation of one or more Peri A N-terminal PKA sites (sites 1, 2, and 3 = serines 81, 223, and 277) (see Fig. 1A) (15Souza S.

No function of any other individual Peri A PKA site has been demonstrated. To obtain a more physiologically realistic picture of how the perilipin PKA site phosphorylation regulates adipocyte lipolysis, we developed a stable line of retrovirally engineered perilipin null (Peri–/–) adipocytes from MEFs of perilipin knock-out mice (20Miyoshi H.

Expression of wild type Peri A fully supports PKA-stimulated lipolysis in these Peri–/– MEF adipocytes, whereas expression of a mutant Peri A lacking all six functional PKA sites (Δ1–6) fails to support PKA-stimulated lipolysis (20Miyoshi H.

It is unknown whether Peri A mediates lipase-selective regulation of adipocyte lipolysis and, if so, how phosphorylation of different Peri A PKA sites hierarchically structures and spatiotemporally coordinates this regulation. Using adenoviral expression of Peri A PKA site mutants, we now demonstrate that serine 517 (PKA site 6) globally regulates all PKA-stimulated FA and glycerol release in MEF adipocytes. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated “knockdown” of ATGL and HSL reveals that this regulation reflects the absolute necessity of serine 517 phosphorylation for ATGL-mediated lipolysis in response to PKA activation. These observations provide the first evidence that Peri A regulates ATGL-mediated lipolysis. Moreover, we identify serine 517 as a novel master regulator of PKA-dependent Peri A functions regulating hormone-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes.

Adenoviral Expression of Peri A Constructs in Peri–/– MEF Adipocytes—Recombinant adenovirus was transduced into Peri–/– MEFs with Lipofectamine Plus™ (Invitrogen) on day 2 (adenovirus shRNAs) or day 3 (all other adenovirus) after induction of differentiation. The amount of each adenovirus used was selected to assure comparable levels of expression of the different Peri A constructs, which was confirmed by Western blots and densitometry (16Zhang H.H.

Open table in a new tab Phosphorylation of One or More Peri A C-terminal PKA Sites Is Required for PKA-stimulated Lipolysis in MEF Adipocytes—Peri A contains six serine residues that are consensus PKA phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1A). We have previously shown that a Peri A construct (Δ1–6) containing serine to alanine substitutions at all six PKA sites (Fig. 1A) fails to support PKA-stimulated lipolysis in Peri–/– MEF adipocytes (20Miyoshi H. Souza S. Zhang H.-H. Strissel K. Christoffolete M. Kovsan J. Rudich A. Kraemer F. Bianco A. Obin M. Greenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In initial studies we assessed the relative contribution of N-terminal PKA sites (sites 1–3) and C-terminal PKA sites (sites 4–6) to PKA-stimulated lipolysis. We adenovirally transduced Peri–/– MEF adipocytes with wild type Peri A or with Peri A that contained either 1) serine to alanine substitutions at all PKA sites (Δ1–6), 2) serine to alanine substitutions at the N-terminal PKA sites (Δ1–3), or 3) serine to alanine substitutions at the C-terminal PKA sites (Δ4–6) (Fig. 1B). PKA-stimulated lipolysis (glycerol release) was fully supported by wild type Peri A and totally abrogated by Δ1–6, confirming our recent observations in MEF adipocytes (20Miyoshi H. Souza S. Zhang H.-H. Strissel K. Christoffolete M. Kovsan J. Rudich A. Kraemer F. Bianco A. Obin M. Greenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Notably, total abrogation of PKA-stimulated lipolysis was also observed in Peri–/– MEF adipocytes expressing Δ4–6 (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that one or more Peri A C-terminal PKA sites is required for PKA-stimulated lipolysis in these cells. In contrast, expression of Δ1–3 supported PKA-stimulated lipolysis, although the magnitude of lipolysis was attenuated ∼40% (Fig. 1B). This observation indicates that Peri A N-terminal PKA sites are not essential for PKA-stimulated lipolysis in MEF adipocytes; however, phosphorylation of one or more N-terminal PKA sites enhances PKA-stimulated lipolysis in the presence of one or more phosphorylated C-terminal PKA sites. Selective Mutation of Serine 517 (PKA Site 6) Abrogates PKA-stimulated Lipolysis in MEF Adipocytes—To identify the C-terminal PKA sites that are essential for PKA-stimulated lipolysis, we conducted lipolysis assays with full-length Peri A constructs containing individual serine to alanine mutations at PKA sites 4(Δ4), 5(Δ5), or 6(Δ6). Surprisingly, mutation of site 6 alone (Δ6) was sufficient to fully abrogate PKA-stimulated lipolysis (Fig. 2A), thereby recapitulating the inhibitory effects of both Δ1–6 and Δ4–6 (Fig. 1B). Thus, functional PKA sites 1–5 are insufficient to promote any PKA-stimulated increase in lipo"

In contrast to extensive studies on tocopherol, very little is known about tocotrienol. Because the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway has a central role in tumorigenesis, we investigated the effect of γ-tocotrienol on the NF-κB pathway. Althoughγ-tocotrienol completely abolished tumor necrosis factor α (TNF)-induced NF-κB activation, a similar dose of γ-tocopherol had no effect. Besides TNF, γ-tocotrienol also abolished NF-κB activation induced by phorbol myristate acetate, okadaic acid, lipopolysaccharide, cigarette smoke, interleukin-1β, and epidermal growth factor. Constitutive NF-κB activation expressed by certain tumor cells was also abrogated by γ-tocotrienol. Reducing agent had no effect on the γ-tocotrienol-induced down-regulation of NF-κB. Mevalonate reversed the NF-κB inhibitory effect of γ-tocotrienol, indicating the role of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase. γ-Tocotrienol blocked TNF-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα through the inhibition of IκBα kinase activation, thus leading to the suppression of the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65. γ-Tocotrienol also suppressed NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription induced by TNF, TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, TAK1, receptor-interacting protein, NIK, and IκBα kinase but not that activated by p65. Additionally, the expressions of NF-κB-regulated gene products associated with antiapoptosis (IAP1, IAP2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, cFLIP, XIAP, Bfl-1/A1, TRAF1, and Survivin), proliferation (cyclin D1, COX2, and c-Myc), invasion (MMP-9 and ICAM-1), and angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor) were down-regulated byγ-tocotrienol. This correlated with potentiation of apoptosis induced by TNF, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin. Overall, our results demonstrate that γ-tocotrienol inhibited the NF-κB activation pathway, leading to down-regulation of various gene products and potentiation of apoptosis.

Although both tocopherols and tocotrienols exist as α, β, γ, and δ forms and are members of the vitamin E family, the two differ structurally in that tocopherols contain a saturated phytyl chain, and tocotrienols possess an unsaturated side chain. The source of these vitamins also differ; tocopherols are components of nuts and common vegetable oils and tocotrienols are primarily derived from oat, wheat germ, barley, rye, rice bran, and palm oil (1Kamal-Eldin A. Appelqvist L.A. Lipids. 1996; 31: 671-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1482) Google Scholar). The unsaturated side chain present in tocotrienols facilitates its entry through the membrane bilayer more efficiently than the saturated chain of tocopherol (2Suzuki Y.J. Tsuchiya M. Wassall S.R.

Lin (University of Texas, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston) (34Blonska M. Shambharkar P.B. Kobayashi M. Zhang D. Sakurai H. Su B. Lin X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43056-43063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cell Lines—Human myeloid KBM-5 cells, human lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cells, human embryonic kidney A293 cells, human breast cancer MCF-7, multiple myeloma U266 cells, and human squamous cell carcinoma SCC-4 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). KBM-5 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 15% FBS. H1299, MCF-7, and U266 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, and A293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. SCC-4 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids, pyruvate, glutamine, and vitamins. All media were also supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cytotoxicity Assay—The effect of γ-tocotrienol on the cytotoxic effects of TNF and chemotherapeutic reagents was determined by the MTT uptake method as described previously. Briefly, 5,000 cells were incubated with 5 μm γ-tocotrienol for 12 h in triplicate on 96-well plates and then treated with 5 nm paclitaxel and 100 nm doxorubicin for 24 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, an MTT solution was added to each well. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, extraction buffer (20% SDS and 50% dimethylformamide) was added, the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the absorbance was then measured at 570 nm using a 96-well multiscanner (MRX Revelation; Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Live and Dead Assay—To assess cytotoxicity, we used the Live and Dead assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which determines intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity. We performed this assay as described previously (35Shishodia S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47148-47158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were incubated with 25 μm γ-tocotrienol for 12 h and then treated with 1 nm TNF for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were stained with the Live and Dead reagent (5 μm ethidium homodimer and 5 μm calcein-AM) and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Annexin V Assay—One of the early indicators of apoptosis is the rapid translocation and accumulation of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine from the cytoplasmic interface of the cell to the extracellular surface. This loss of membrane asymmetry can be detected using the binding properties of annexin V. To detect apoptosis, we employed annexin V antibody conjugated with the fluorescent dye FITC. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were pretreated with 25 μm γ-tocotrienol for 12 h, treated with 1 nm TNF for 24 h, and then subjected to annexin V staining. Cells were washed, stained with FITC-conjugated anti-annexin V antibody, and then analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences). Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated Deoxyuridine Triphosphate Nick End-labeling Assay—We assayed cytotoxicity by the TUNEL method, which examines DNA strand breaks during apoptosis, using an in situ cell death detection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were pretreated with 25 μm γ-tocotrienol for 12 h and treated with 1 nm TNF for 24 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, cells were incubated with reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 °C. Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). PARP Cleavage Assay—For detection of cleavage products of PARP, whole-cell extracts were prepared by subjecting 25 μm γ-tocotrienol-treated cells to lysis in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.005 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 mm NaVO4). Lysates were spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to remove insoluble material, resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and probed with PARP antibodies. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—To assess NF-κB activation, we performed EMSA as described previously (36Chaturvedi M.M. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 319: 585-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells (2 × 106/ml) were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide (15 μg of protein with 16 fmol of DNA) from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat, 5′-TTGTTACAA GGGACTTTC CGCTG GGGACTTTC CAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′ (boldface indicates NF-κB-binding sites), for 30 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein complex formed was separated from free oligonucleotide on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide, 5′-TTGTTACAA CTCACTTTC CGCTG CTCACTTTC CAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′, was used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-κB to the DNA. The dried gels were visualized with a Storm820, and radioactive bands were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—To determine the levels of protein expression in the cytoplasm and nucleus, we prepared extracts (37Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3278-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and fractionated them by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with the relevant antibody, and detected by ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The bands were quantitated using a Personal Densitometer Scan version 1.30 using Image-Quant software version 3.3 (GE Healthcare). IKK Assay—To determine the effect of γ-tocotrienol on TNF-induced IKK activation, IKK assay was performed by a method we described previously (38Takada Y. Mukhopadhyay A. Kundu G.C. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24233-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), with the following exceptions. Briefly, the IKK complex from whole-cell extracts was precipitated with antibody against IKK-α and then treated with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). After 2 h, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and then resuspended in a kinase assay mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 2mm dithiothreitol, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 2 μg of substrate GST-IκBα (amino acids 1-54). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling with SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE; the gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized with a Storm820. To determine the total amounts of IKK-α and IKK-β in each sample, 50 μg of whole-cell proteins was resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then blotted with either anti-IKK-α or anti-IKK-β antibody. NF-κB-dependent Reporter Gene Expression Assay—The effect of γ-tocotrienol on NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription induced by TNF and various genes was analyzed by secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) assay as described previously (39Ashikawa K. Majumdar S. Banerjee S. Bharti A.C. Shishodia S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6490-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), with the following exceptions. Briefly, A293 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates and transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method with pNF-κB-SEAP (0.5 μg). To examine reporter gene expression induced by various genes, we transfected A293 cells with 0.5 μg of pNF-κB-SEAP plasmid with 1 μg of an expressing plasmid and 0.5 μg of the control plasmid pCMVFLAG1 for 24 h, treated them with 25 μm γ-tocotrienol for 12 h, and then harvested them from culture medium after an additional 24 h of incubation. Culture medium was analyzed for SEAP activity according to the protocol essentially as described by the manufacturer (Clontech) using a Victor 3 microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For TAK1/TAB1 and RIP experiments, A293 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were transiently transfected with the expression vectors for TAK1/TAB1 or RIP and pNF-κB-SEAP (0.5 μg) plasmids by the FuGENE 6 method (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h, cells were treated with indicated concentrations of γ-tocotrienol, and conditioned medium was harvested after 12 h for SEAP activity. Cells were cotransfected with β-galactosidase and normalized the data with β-galactosidase assay (data not shown). This study was designed to investigate the effects of γ-tocotrienol on the TNF-activated NF-κB signaling pathway that regulates apoptosis. Most of the studies were carried out using human chronic myeloid leukemia cells (KBM-5) because these cells express both types of TNF receptors. γ-Tocotrienol but Not γ-Tocopherol Blocks TNF-induced NF-κB Activation—Because γ-tocopherol and γ-tocotrienol exhibit significant structural homology (Fig. 1A), we examined the effect of both types of vitamins for their ability to suppress TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Fig. 1B shows that although neither of them alone activated NF-κB, under identical conditions γ-tocotrienol completely suppressed TNF-induced NF-κB activation, whereas γ-tocopherol did not suppress at all. γ-Tocotrienol Blocks NF-κB Activation Induced by Various Agents—Because various agents have been shown to activate NF-κB through diverse pathways, we examined the effect of γ-tocotrienol on the NF-κB activation induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factor, and carcinogens. A DNA-binding assay (EMSA) showed that γ-tocotrienol suppressed the NF-κB activation induced by TNF, PMA, okadaic acid, cigarette smoke condensate, lipopolysaccharide, and epidermal growth factor (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that γ-tocotrienol acted at a step in the NF-κB activation pathway that is common to all these agents. Inhibition of NF-κB Activation by γ-Tocotrienol Is Not Cell Type-specific—Distinct signal transduction pathways can mediate NF-κB induction in different cell types (40Bonizzi G. Piette J. Merville M.P. Bours V. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5264-5272PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3286) Google Scholar). Therefore, besides myeloid cells, we investigated the effect ofγ-tocotrienol on TNF-induced NF-κB activation in human epithelial H1299, A293, and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1D). TNF activated NF-κB in all these cells, and γ-tocotrienol suppressed this activation in all three cell lines. γ-Tocotrienol Inhibits Constitutive NF-κB Activation—A large variety of tumor cells express constitutively active NF-κB, and this activation may differ from inducible activation (42Pacifico F. Leonardi A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1142-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next tested the effect of γ-tocotrienol on NF-κB activation in human multiple myeloma (U266) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC4) tumor cells, which both express constitutively active NF-κB (43Bharti A.C. Donato N. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 44Jackson-Bernitsas D.G. Ichikawa H. Takada Y. Myers J.N. Lin X.L. Darnay B.G. Chaturvedi M.M. Aggarwal B.B. Oncogene,. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). U266 and SCC4 cells were treated with different concentrations of γ-tocotrienol and then analyzed for NF-κB activation. γ-Tocotrienol inhibited constitutively active NF-κB in both cell types in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E). These results taken together indicate that γ-tocotrienol inhibited both inducible and constitutive NF-κB activation. γ-Tocotrienol Inhibits TNF-induced NF-κB Activation in a Dose- and Time-dependent Manner—We next investigated whether suppression of TNF-induced NF-κBby γ-tocotrienol is time-dependent. For this, we incubated the KBM-5 cells with 25 μm γ-tocotrienol for up to 24 h and then exposed the cells to 0.1 nm TNF for 30 min. EMSA results showed that γ-tocotrienol alone even for 24 h did not activate NF-κB, but it abolished TNF-induced NF-κB activation almost maximally at 12 h (Fig. 2A). To determine the dose response, cells were pretreated with different doses of γ-tocotrienol for 12 h and then were stimulated with 0.1 nm TNF for 30 min. As indicated by EMSA, γ-tocotrienol suppressed TNF-induced NF-κB activation in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Under these conditions, cells were fully viable as determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion test (data not shown). To determine the effect of γ-tocotrienol on the time course of TNF-induced NF-κB activation, we pretreated cells with 25 μm γ-tocotrienol for 12 h, exposed them to 0.1 nm TNF for different times, and then examined the cells for NF-κB in the nucleus by EMSA. The activation of NF-κB by TNF was found to be time-dependent. Cells pretreated with γ-tocotrienol showed a lack of TNF-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2C). To determine the effect of γ-tocotrienol on NF-κB activation at higher TNF concentrations, cells were pretreated with 25 μm γ-tocotrienol for 12 h, treated with various concentrations of TNF for 30 min, and then analyzed for NF-κB activation (Fig. 2D). Cells pretreated with γ-tocotrienol showed a lack of NF-κB activation even when exposed to a very high concentration of TNF. These results show that γ-tocotrienol is a very potent inhibitor of TNF-induced NF-κB activation. γ-Tocotrienol Does Not Interfere with the Binding of NF-κBtoDNA—Several agents have been described by our laboratory and others that modify the NF-κB protein so that it can no longer bind to the DNA (45Chiang Y.M.

https://openalex.org/W2076734646,"Phospholipase Cbeta (PLCbeta) isozymes represent a family of molecules that link G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to an intracellular signaling network. Here, we investigated the function of PLCbeta isozymes in sensory neurons by using mutant mice deficient for specific PLCbeta family members. Expression analysis indicated that PLCbeta3, one of the four isoforms, is predominantly expressed in a subpopulation of C-fiber nociceptors. A subset of these neurons expressed the histamine H1 receptor. Ca(2+) imaging studies revealed that PLCbeta3 specifically mediates histamine-induced calcium responses through the histamine H1 receptor in cultured sensory neurons. In line with this, we found that PLCbeta3(-/-) mice showed significant defects in scratching behavior induced by histamine; histamine-trifluoromethyl-toluidine (HTMT), a selective H1 agonist; and compound 48/80, a mast cell activator. These results demonstrate that PLCbeta3 is required to mediate ""itch"" sensation in response to histamine acting on the histamine H1 receptor in C-fiber nociceptive neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2165554927,"The presynaptic regions of axons accumulate synaptic vesicles, active zone proteins and periactive zone proteins. However, the rules for orderly recruitment of presynaptic components are not well understood. We systematically examined molecular mechanisms of presynaptic development in egg-laying synapses of Caenorhabditis elegans, demonstrating that two scaffolding molecules, SYD-1 and SYD-2, have key roles in presynaptic assembly. SYD-2 (liprin-alpha) was previously shown to regulate the size and the shape of active zones. We now show that in syd-1 and syd-2 mutants, synaptic vesicles and numerous other presynaptic proteins fail to accumulate at presynaptic sites. SYD-1 and SYD-2 function cell-autonomously at presynaptic terminals, downstream of synaptic specificity molecule SYG-1. SYD-1 is likely to act upstream of SYD-2 to positively regulate its synaptic assembly activity. These data imply a hierarchical organization of presynaptic assembly, in which transmembrane specificity molecules initiate synaptogenesis by recruiting a few key scaffolding proteins, which in turn assemble other presynaptic components."

For example, sublethal injury of renal proximal tubular cells (RPTCs) with the model oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) causes mitochondrial injury that recovers over the course of six days. Although regeneration of mitochondrial function is integral to cell repair and function, the signaling pathway of mitochondrial biogenesis following oxidant injury has not been examined. A 10-fold overexpression of the mitochondrial biogenesis regulator PPAR-γ cofactor-1α (PGC-1α) in control RPTCs resulted in a 52% increase in mitochondrial number, a 27% increase in respiratory capacity, and a 30% increase in mitochondrial protein markers, demonstrating that PGC-1α mediates mitochondrial biogenesis in RPTCs. RPTCs sublethally injured with TBHP exhibited a 50% decrease in mitochondrial function and increased mitochondrial autophagy. Compared with the controls, PGC-1α levels increased 12-fold on days 1, 2, and 3 post-injury and returned to base line on day 4 as mitochondrial function returned. Inhibition p38 MAPK blocked the up-regulation of PGC-1α following oxidant injury, whereas inhibition of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, calcineurin A, nitric-oxide synthase, and phosphoinositol 3-kinase had no effect. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was activated following TBHP exposure, and the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 blocked the up-regulation of PGC-1α. Additional inhibitor studies revealed that the sequential activation of Src, p38 MAPK, EGFR, and p38 MAPK regulate the expression of PGC-1α following oxidant injury. In contrast, although Akt was activated following oxidant injury, it did not play a role in PGC-1α expression. We suggest that mitochondrial biogenesis following oxidant injury is mediated by p38 and EGFR activation of PGC-1α.

Drug Delivery Rev. 2001; 49: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These changes in renal proximal tubular cell (RPTC) energetics also are observed in cellular models subjected to diverse stresses (22Cummings B.S. Zangar R.C. Novak R.F. Lash L.H.

For example, sublethally injured RPTCs exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, such as decreases in oxygen consumption and ATP levels, following exposure to the model oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide that spontaneously recovers over the course of six days (27Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C28-C33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nowak G. Aleo M.D. Morgan J.A. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F509-F515PubMed Google Scholar). The recovery of mitochondrial function is temporally related to RPTC de-differentiation, migration, and proliferation, and complete recovery of mitochondrial function is associated with RPTC redifferentiation (28Nowak G. Aleo M.D. Morgan J.A. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F509-F515PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kays S.E. Schnellmann R.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1995; 132: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The recovery of mitochondrial function is central to the overall restoration of cell structure and function. EGFR expression is up-regulated following renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (30Safirstein R. Price P.M. Saggi S.J. Harris R.C. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 1515-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 31Taira T. Yoshimura A. Iizuka K. Inui K. Oshiden K. Iwasaki S. Ideura T. Koshikawa S. Virchows Arch. 1996; 427: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the EGFR is required for recovery of function following mercuric chloride-induced renal failure in mice (32Lu Y. Yu Q. Liu J.H. Zhang J. Wang H. Koul D. McMurray J.S. Fang X. Yung W.K. Siminovitch K.A. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40057-40066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Further, the EGFR is an important mediator of RPTC dedifferentiation, migration, and proliferation following diverse forms of injury (33Zhuang S. Yan Y. Han J. Schnellmann R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21036-21042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Zhuang S. Dang Y. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F365-F372Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For example, Src-dependent phosphorylation of p38 MPAK results in the transactivation of the EGFR following exposure to hydrogen peroxide (33Zhuang S. Yan Y. Han J. Schnellmann R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21036-21042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that p38 MAPK transactivation of the EGFR may be important in the recovery of RPTC function following oxidant injury. Although the regenerative properties of the RPTC are known, the mechanisms of mitochondrial biogenesis following injury have not been examined nor has a central role of PGC-1α been determined in this process. In this study, we have elucidated a mechanism for mitochondrial biogenesis following oxidant injury. Reagents—LY294002, AG1478, and SB203580 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and Tocris (Ellisville, MO), respectively. Fenvalerate and BAY 41-2272 were purchased from Alexis Corporation (San Diego, CA). ODQ was purchased from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies to phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068), phospho-Src (Tyr416), Src, phospho-p38, and p38 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The antibodies to PGC-1α, COX III, and the EGFR were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-PGC-1α and anti-COX III was used at concentrations of 1:500 and 1:300, respectively, whereas all other antibodies were used at 1:1000. Isolation and Culture of Renal Proximal Tubules—Female New Zealand White rabbits (2 kg) were purchased from Myrtle's Rabbitry (Thompson Station, TN). RPTCs were isolated using the iron oxide perfusion method and grown in 35-mm tissue culture dishes under improved conditions as previously described (35Nowak G. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C2072-C2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The culture medium was a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (without glucose, phenol red, or sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 15 mm HEPES buffer, 2.5 mm l-glutamine, 1 μm pyridoxine HCl, 15 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 6 mm lactate. Hydrocortisone (50 nm), selenium (5 ng/ml), human transferrin (5 μg/ml), bovine insulin (10 nm), and l-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (50 μm) were added daily to fresh culture medium. Confluent RPTCs were used for all experiments. RPTC monolayers were pretreated with various inhibitors for 1 h and exposed to 200 μm TBHP for 45 min, at which point the oxidant-containing media were removed, fresh media were added, and inhibitors replaced as indicated in the figure legends. Replication-deficient Adenovirus Infection—Recombinant adenovirus-expressing PGC-1α and nuclear GFP control were generous gifts from Bruce Spiegelman (Harvard Medical School) (36Lee W.J. Kim M. Park H.S. Kim H.S. Jeon M.J. Oh K.S. Koh E.H. Won J.C. Kim M.S. Oh G.T. Yoon M. Lee K.U. Park J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Viral titers were determined by plaque formation assay using HEK293 cells and expressed as plaque-forming units. RPTCs were infected with each virus at a multiplicity of infection of 30 plaque-forming units for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Afterward, the cultures were placed in normal culture media for an additional 24 h, at which point all measurements were taken. At an multiplicity of infection of 30 plaque-forming units, 99% of the cells showed expression of the viral gene insert as indicated by flow cytometry (data not shown). Basal Oxygen Consumption (QO2)—On days 1–6 after TBHP injury, RPTCs were gently detached from the culture dishes with a rubber policeman and transferred to a 37 °C QO2 chamber. Basal and uncoupled (FCCP) RPTC QO2 was measured polarographically by using a Clark-type electrode as described previously (35Nowak G. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C2072-C2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid-based Transfections—Transient transfections of RPTCs were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cell Number—Measurement of monolayer protein content over time was used to estimate cell number. On days 1–6 after TBHP injury, RPTC monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in Triton buffer (0.05% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-base, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), sonicated for 60 s, and protein concentrations determined by the bicinchoninic acid according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Confocal Microscopy—All microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Cells for imaging were plated on 35-mm glass bottom 14-mm microwell Petri dishes from MatTeck Corporation (Ashland, MA). Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblot Analysis—After treatment, RPTCs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and harvested in cell lysis buffer from BioVision (Mountain View, CA). Cells were disrupted by sonication for 30 s. Equal amounts of cellular protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After treatment with 5% skim milk or bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight, membranes were incubated with various antibodies for 2 h and then incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. Bound antibodies were visualized after chemiluminescence detection on an AlphaEaseFC stand alone imaging system (San Leandro, CA). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. and were subjected to one- or two-way analysis of variance as appropriate. Multiple means were compared using Student-Newman-Keuls test. p < 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference between mean values. Renal proximal tubules isolated from an individual rabbit represent a single experiment (n = 1). Experiments were performed with 2–5 plates of cells and repeated until an n value of at least 3 was reached. Exposure of RPTC to the adenovirus that produced PGC-1α expression resulted in a 10-fold increase in PGC-1α protein expression at 48 h (Fig. 1A). The green fluorescent protein expressed on the C terminus of PGC-1α was localized to the RPTC nuclear compartment, consistent with its role as a nuclear receptor coactivator (Fig. 1B). The mitochondria of RPTC infected with the adenoviral PGC-1α and nuclear GFP controls were stained with the potentiometric dye MitoTracker red, and visualization of the mitochondria using confocal microscopy revealed an increase in red staining in RPTCs in the PGC-1α-treated group (Fig. 1B). Quantification of this change in staining intensity revealed a 51% increase in mitochondrial number/mass in RPTCs overexpressing PGC-1α compared with GFP controls (Fig. 1C). These results reveal that PGC-1α increases mitochondrial biogenesis in confluent RPTCs under basal conditions. To determine whether PGC-1α overexpression in RPTC results in changes in mitochondrial respiration, basal and uncoupled (FCCP) oxygen consumption (QO2) were measured. Increased PGC-1α resulted in a 32% increase in basal QO2 and a 26% increase in uncoupled QO2 compared with controls (Fig. 2), indicative of the biogenesis of functional mitochondria. Examination of both nuclear and mitochondrial encoded protein constituents of the electron transport chain following adenovirus-mediated expression of PGC-1α revealed 2- and 1.5-fold increases of the nuclear encoded proteins ATP synthase β-subunit and cytochrome c and a 1.2-fold increase in COX III expression compared with controls (Fig. 3). These increases in mitochondrial number/mass, function, and protein expression demonstrate that PGC-1α is a primary regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in the renal proximal tubule and a potential target for regulating cellular bioenergetics in the kidney following injury.FIGURE 3A, adenoviral overexpression of PGC-1α increased nuclear and mitochondrial-encoded mitochondrial proteins (ATP-synthaseβ, cytochrome c, and COX II).

Veh, vehicle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Control RPTCs transfected with a mitochondrially targeted GFP showed a normal branched morphology and did not associate with lysosomes stained with LysoTracker Red (Fig. 4). RPTCs affected by acute TBHP exposure (200 μm for 45 min) underwent significant mitochondrial autophagy 24 h following injury, as demonstrated by the colocalization of mitochondria and lysosomes (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with the loss of mitochondrial function triggering the selective autophagy of mitochondria (37Lemasters J.J. Rejuvenation Res. 2005; 8: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 38Priault M. Salin B. Schaeffer J. Vallette F.M. de Rago J.P. Martinou J.C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1613-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although RPTCs expressed low levels of PGC-1α protein under basal conditions, following acute TBHP exposure, PGC-1α protein levels increased 12-fold 24 h after injury (Fig. 5). Levels of PGC-1α remained elevated for three days following injury and then returned to control levels four days after the oxidant insult. Basal QO2 increased on day 2 following oxidant exposure and returned to control levels on day 4 (Fig. 5). Uncoupled QO2 increased on day 3 and returned to control levels on day 4. Thus, following oxidant exposure, PGC-1α protein levels markedly increased within 24 h, were maintained while basal and uncoupled QO2 were increasing, and returned to control levels when basal and uncoupled QO2 returned to control levels. To determine the signaling mechanisms responsible for the up-regulation of PGC-1α following oxidant injury, RPTCs were pretreated with a variety of inhibitors of signaling molecules known to regulate PGC-1α, nitric-oxide synthase, soluble guanylyl cyclase, CaMK, calcineurin A, and p38 and exposed to the inhibitors for 24 h after injury. The nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME (3 mm) had no effect on the expression of PGC-1α after injury nor did treatment with the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1 μm) or the soluble guanylyl cyclase agonist BAY41–2271 (1 μm), revealing that PGC-1α is not being regulated by a nitric oxide-dependent pathway (Fig. 6). Treatment with inhibitors of CaMK (KN-62, 1 μm) and calcineurin A (fenvalerate, 1 μm) also had no effect on the expression of PGC-1α compared with cells exposed to TBHP alone (Fig. 6). In contrast, inhibition of PGC-1α expression following injury was observed with the addition of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm) (Fig. 6). We previously reported (33Zhuang S. Yan Y. Han J. Schnellmann R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21036-21042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Zhuang S. Dang Y. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F365-F372Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that p38 is activated in RPTCs in response to H2O2 and interacts with Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the EGFR. Similarly, exposure to TBHP also results in the phosphorylation of Src, p38, and the EGFR (Fig. 7). PP1 (10 μm) completely abolished the up-regulation of PGC-1α as did an inhibitor of the EGFR (AG1478, 20 μm) (Fig. 7). In contrast, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with LY202190 (10 μm) had no effect on PGC-1α expression (Fig. 7). Having established that Src, p38, and the EGFR play a role in PGC-1α expression following oxidant injury, we confirmed that these kinases are activated following oxidant exposure and sought to place these signaling molecules into a mitochondrial biogenesis pathway. Both Src and p38 were maximally phosphorylated within 5 min of TBHP exposure, whereas the EGFR was not maximally phosphorylated until 20 min after exposure to TBHP (Fig. 8). RPTCs were preincubated with PP1, SB203580, or AG1478 and then exposed to TBHP or a vehicle control for 30 min, and samples were taken for immunoblot analysis. Pretreatment with PP1 prevented the phosphorylation of Src, p38 MAPK, and the EGFR, suggesting Src is upstream of p38 and the EGFR (Fig. 8). Pretreatment with SB203580 prevented the phosphorylation of p38 and the EGFR but not Src, suggesting that p38 is downstream of Src and is responsible for the transactivation of the EGFR (Fig. 8). Inhibition of EGFR activation with AG1478 prevented the phosphorylation of the EGFR but did not prevent the phosphorylation of either Src or p38, suggesting that the EGFR is indeed downstream of Src and p38 (Fig. 8) immediately following TBHP exposure. Phosphorylation of both p38 and the EGFR is still present 60 min after TBHP exposure (Fig. 9). Pretreatment of RPTCs with SB203580 prevents the phosphorylation of the EGFR at 60 min; however, when SB203580 is added 30 min after exposure to TBHP, it no longer inhibits EGFR phosphorylation, suggesting that, although p38 is responsible for the initial transactivation of the EGFR, the sustained phosphorylation of the EGFR occurs through another mechanism (Fig. 9). As stated above, pretreatment with AG1478 does not inhibit p38 phosphorylation, placing p38 upstream of the EGFR during initiation of the signaling cascade (Fig. 9). Interestingly, when AG1478 is added after 30 min of TBHP exposure, p38 phosphorylation is abolished, suggesting that the EGFR mediates the late stage phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 9). PGC-1α is generally thought to be the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis in adipose tissue, heart, and liver (39Scarpulla R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1576: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that PGC-1α has the ability to induce mitochondrial biogenesis in control RPTCs, suggesting that PGC-1α also plays a central role in regulating the biogenesis in RPTCs. PGC-1α is known to up-regulate gluconeogenesis (36Lee W.J. Kim M. Park H.S. Kim H.S. Jeon M.J. Oh K.S. Koh E.H. Won J.C. Kim M.S. Oh G.T. Yoon M. Lee K.U. Park J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although mitochondrial biogenesis has been studied in response to different stimuli in a few tissues (1Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar, 2Suliman H.B. Welty-Wolf K.E. Carraway M. Tatro L. Piantadosi C.A. Cardiovasc.

Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Russell R.R. III Young L.H. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), the mechanisms of mitochondrial biogenesis following cell injury and regeneration has not been examined. We previously demonstrated that oxidant exposure (i.e. TBHP) decreases mitochondrial function and that mitochondrial function returns over a period of days to control levels (27Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C28-C33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nowak G. Aleo M.D. Morgan J.A. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F509-F515PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we have shown that the loss of mitochondrial function is associated mitochondrial damage and autophagy. One day following oxidant injury, basal respiration increased, whereas uncoupled respiration did not. This response is consistent with the idea that the cells utilize the residual capacity of the mitochondria to survive and initiate repair. On day two following injury, both basal and uncoupled respiration increased and returned to control values on day 4. Because ectopic expression of PGC-1α in RPTCs resulted in robust biogenesis of mitochondria, we hypothesized that up-regulation of endogenous PGC-1α was responsible for the restoration of mitochondrial function by regulating the production of new mitochondria. The up-regulation of PGC-1α on days 1–3 post-injury is consistent with the initiation of the recovery of mitochondrial function, whereas the decrease in PGC-1α on day four is consistent with a negative feedback mechanism preventing the formation of additional mitochondria as mitochondrial function is restored. Of the various signaling mechanisms that have been implicated in the regulation of PGC-1α expression, including nitric oxide (5Nisoli E. Tonello C. Cardile A. Cozzi V. Bracale R. Tedesco L.

Our results are consistent with reports that phosphorylation of p38 MAPK increases PGC-1α expression by stabilizing existing protein (1Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M.

Interestingly, following oxidant injury, p38 MAPK appears to play two roles in mitochondrial biogenesis upstream and downstream of the EGFR (see below). Following injury, p38 MAPK is phosphorylated by Src and then transactivates the EGFR. This signaling pathway appears to be a common response of RPTCs to oxidant injury, as the same signaling cascade was observed following acute exposure of RPTCs to H2O2 (33Zhuang S. Yan Y. Han J. Schnellmann R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21036-21042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of EGFR transactivation by p38 MAPK has yet to be determined. Our experiments also provide evidence that p38 MAPK is an EGFR substrate in this model system. The addition of the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 30 min post-oxidant addition blocked the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and decreased PGC-1a expression. The role of the EGFR in mitochondrial biogenesis may, in part, be sustaining the actions of p38 MAPK on PGC-1α expression and stability. Interestingly, activation of the EGFR through the addition of exogenous EGF (10 ng/ml for 24 h) strongly activated the EGFR but did not increase the expression of PGC-1α (data not shown), suggesting that EGFR-dependent PGC-1α expression is dependent upon the transactivation of the EGFR. This is the first report that the EGFR is a mediator of mitochondrial biogenesis. We previously demonstrated that oxidant-induced injury results in the dedifferentiation, migration, and proliferation through the EGFR (33Zhuang S. Yan Y. Han J. Schnellmann R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21036-21042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Zhuang S. Dang Y. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F365-F372Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). EGFR initiation of mitochondrial biogenesis, in concert with dedifferentiation, migration, and proliferation, may represent an integrated pathway to ensure sufficient energy for repair, regeneration, and ultimately, the return of normal differentiation function. The EGFR is capable of activating a series of signaling pathways that may be involved in regulating PGC-1α expression, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (34Zhuang S. Dang Y. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F365-F372Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 42Yano T. Yazima S. Hagiwara K. Ozasa H. Ishizuka S. Horikawa S. Nephron. 1999; 81: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt had no effect on the expression of PGC-1α following oxidant exposure. Yet, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt is activated following oxidant injury in this model and is required for cellular proliferation (34Zhuang S. Dang Y. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J.

However, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt may contribute to the biogenesis of mitochondria downstream of PGC-1α by directly phosphorylating nuclear respiratory factor 1 and inducing mitochondrial transcription factor-A (2Suliman H.B. Welty-Wolf K.E. Carraway M. Tatro L. Piantadosi C.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 64: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This pathway may also be involved in regulating the shift from glycogen storage to glucose utilization through the Akt-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (43Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). We cannot disregard a possible role for the activation of AMP kinase in regulating PGC-1α in our model. AMP kinase is activated in response to cell stressors causing perturbations in cAMP/ATP ratios (44McGee S.L. Hargreaves M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2006; 33: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), can participate in the activation of the p38MAPK-signaling cascade (4Li J. Miller E.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Russell R.R.

Aleo M.D. Morgan J.A. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F509-F515PubMed Google Scholar) and AMP kinase is known to be activated under conditions of renal ischemia (50Mount P.F. Hill R.E.

Physiol. 2005; 289: F1103-F1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it is possible that AMP kinase is activated following oxidant treatment in our model and will be the subject of future experiments. In summary, PGC-1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis following oxidant injury may promote the repair and recovery of RPTCs and is regulated by a unique signaling pathway involving the activation of Src, p38 MAPK, and the EGFR. Elucidating the mechanisms behind the recovery of mitochondrial function after injury may provide a promising target to accelerate recovery of cellular functions and may have important implications in the treatment of acute renal failure and other epithelial injuries.

The motor system may coordinate even the most dexterous movements by using a modular architecture involving cortical components. A central question in the study of motor control is how the many degrees of freedom are controlled in a highly redundant musculoskeletal system (Bernstein, 1967Bernstein N. The co-ordination and regulation of movements. Pergamon, Oxford1967Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a small set of neuromotor synergies, termed “modules,” may represent a possible basis for intentional as well as automatic actions (Flash and Hochner, 2005Flash T. Hochner B. Motor primitives in vertebrates and invertebrates.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 660-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, Poggio and Bizzi, 2004Poggio T. Bizzi E.

Solving Bernstein's Problem: A proposal for the development of coordinated movement by selection.Child Dev. 1993; 64: 960-981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A motor system is thought to exhibit modular properties if a large variety of diverse actions can be generated by recombination of a small set of modules (Poggio and Bizzi, 2004Poggio T. Bizzi E. Generalization in vision and motor control.Nature. 2004; 431: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Support for a modular organization of motor systems has been obtained through computational analysis of muscle activities or movement kinematics in both nonhuman primates (Brochier et al., 2004Brochier T. Spinks R.L. Umilta M.A. Lemon R.N. Patterns of muscle activity underlying object-specific grasp by the Macaque monkey.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 1770-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and humans (Ivanenko et al., 2004Ivanenko Y.P. Poppele R.E. Lacquaniti E.

For instance, using factor analysis, the human gait can be described by combinations of just five muscle activation patterns independent of body weight (Ivanenko et al., 2004Ivanenko Y.P. Poppele R.E. Lacquaniti E. Five basic muscle activation patterns account for muscle activity during human locomotion.J.

Coordination of locomotion with voluntary movements in humans.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7238-7253Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Similarly, principal component analysis (PCA) has revealed that static hand postures (Jerde et al., 2003Jerde T.E. Soechting J.F. Flanders M. Biological constraints simplify the recognition of hand shapes.IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 2003; 50: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, Santello et al., 1998Santello M. Flanders M. Soechting J.F. Postural hand synergies for tool use.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10105-10115PubMed Google Scholar) and entire reach-to-grasp movements (d'Avella et al., 2006d'Avella A. Portone A.

Patterns of hand motion during grasping and the influence of sensory guidance.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1426-1435PubMed Google Scholar) can be conceived of as weighted combinations of just a few main patterns of covariation in joint rotations or muscle activation patterns. However, it is unclear whether this modularity has a causal relationship to neuronal operation, and if so, at which locations in the motor system this modularity is implemented. This uncertainty arises because the rules that govern neuronal activity for generating movements cannot be inferred directly through the analysis of the kinematics or muscle activation patterns due to the inverse problem. For example, tremulous motion may originate from the activity of an independent neuronal pacemaker, but it is equally possible that it may originate from reflexively organized neuronal activity or biomechanical properties (Deuschl et al., 2001Deuschl G. Raethjen J. Lindemann M. Krack P. The pathophysiology of tremor.Muscle Nerve. 2001; 24: 716-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Strong causal evidence for a modular operation of the central nervous system (CNS) in movement control is provided if similar modular principles are revealed by direct stimulation of the nervous system. Indeed, the concept of modules as the underlying building blocks of movement generation has gained possibly its strongest experimental support from studies employing electrical (Bizzi et al., 1991Bizzi E. Mussaivaldi F.A. Giszter S. Computations underlying the execution of movement - a biological perspective.Science. 1991; 253: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, Giszter et al., 1993Giszter S.F. Mussa-Ivaldi F.A.

However, with one exception (d'Avella and Bizzi, 1998d'Avella A. Bizzi E. Low dimensionality of supraspinally induced force fields.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 7711-7714Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the evidence was obtained exclusively through direct stimulation of the spinal cord, and most of these studies were performed in frogs. Although intraspinal microstimulation experiments in rats (Tresch and Bizzi, 1999Tresch M.C. Bizzi E. Responses to spinal microstimulation in the chronically spinalized rat and their relationship to spinal systems activated by low threshold cutaneous stimulation.Exp. Brain Res. 1999; 129: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) revealed similar results, experimental support for functional modular organization was notably absent in spinalized cats (Aoyagi et al., 2004Aoyagi Y. Stein R.B. Mushahwar V.K. Prochazka A. The role of neuromuscular properties in determining the end-point of a movement.IEEE Trans. Neural Syst. Rehabil.

Pharmacol. 2004; 82: 702-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is possible, then, that modular neuronal organization of intentional dexterous movements, if at all present in higher-order animals and in humans, may depend on the motor cortex. Here we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the hand representation in the primary motor cortex to test this hypothesis directly in awake humans. This system has a number of unique features that enhance its suitability to address this problem. At moderate intensities, TMS preferentially activates intracortical horizontal fibers (Rothwell, 1997Rothwell J.C. Techniques and mechanisms of action of transcranial stimulation of the human motor cortex.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 74: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), which wire an extended cortical network presynaptic to the corticospinal projection neurons (Huntley and Jones, 1991Huntley G.W. Jones E.G. Relationship of intrinsic connections to forelimb movement representations in monkey motor cortex - a correlative anatomic and physiological study.J. Neurophysiol. 1991; 66: 390-413PubMed Google Scholar). The primary motor cortex and its efferent monosynaptic spinal projections constitute the single most important anatomical substrate for individuated dexterous finger movements (Lang and Schieber, 2004Lang C.E.

Corticospinal Function and Voluntary Movement, Volume 45. Clarendon Press, Oxford1995Crossref Google Scholar). The horizontal intracortical connections, which tend to be preferentially activated by TMS, and the physical dimensions of TMS' induced electric field (Barker, 2002Barker A.T. The history and basic principles of magnetic nerve stimulation.in: Pascual-Leone A. Davey N.J. Rothwell J.C. Wassermann E.M. Puri B.K. Handbook of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.

Shared neural substrates controlling hand movements in human motor cortex.Science. 1995; 268: 1775-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Conditional on naturalistic activation of the anatomic substrate of finger movements by TMS, the hypothesis of a modular CNS operation in movement control would be supported if TMS-evoked movements exhibited modular properties. Validation of results could then be obtained by comparison with properties of voluntary movements. In the present study we first add critical evidence in favor of TMS activation as an experimental paradigm that can reproduce features of natural activation of the primary motor cortex. Secondly, we examine the question of whether TMS-evoked finger movements may show modular properties, and if so, whether they are similar to grasping movements, an extensively well-characterized family of dexterous finger movements whose modular kinematic properties have been documented previously (Santello et al., 1998Santello M. Flanders M. Soechting J.F. Postural hand synergies for tool use.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10105-10115PubMed Google Scholar). Finger movements were evoked by TMS from 30 different stimulation sites arranged as a grid centered over the primary motor cortex. Movements concerning ten finger joints (proximal interphalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints of the long fingers; and metacarpophalangeal joint and carpometacarpal joint of the thumb) were recorded. For analysis, a single hand posture at the time of the maximum summed absolute joint excursions was extracted from the movement signals (Figure 1, see Experimental Procedures for details). This ten-dimensional vector was termed posture vector (PV) and served as the basis for subsequent analyses. Across all subjects and all joints, the mean flexion angle was 2.0° ± 1.7° and the mean extension angle was 1.9° ± 1.6°. Movements occurred around single joints, joints of a single finger, or multiple joints, in both extension and flexion. Of all finger movements, isolated thumb movements were evoked most frequently (14% ± 13% of movements across 18 subjects), followed by movements of the index (10% ± 10%), middle (7% ± 7%), little (4% ± 4%), and ring finger (2% ± 2%). Although isolated finger movements were observable on multiple occasions, it was more common for TMS to elicit movements of several fingers simultaneously (63% ± 16% of evoked movements across 18 subjects). All movements (isolated or as part of composite finger movements) considered, thumb movements, index finger movements, and middle finger movements were evoked with similar frequencies (50% ± 22%; 59% ± 19%; 56% ± 18%, respectively) whereas ring finger movements (41% ± 22%) and little finger movements (38% ± 21%) were elicited somewhat less frequently. Movements evoked by TMS over different scalp positions did not display a prominent systematic topographic pattern. Similar finger movements could be evoked from spatially separate stimulation sites and dissimilar movements could be evoked from stimulation of the same site. This is visualized in Figures 2A and 2B, which show matrices of pairwise distances of all TMS-evoked movements recorded in two subjects. Figure 2C displays a segment of the matrix of one subject (Figure 2A) and illustrates pairs of individual similar and dissimilar posture vectors derived from TMS-evoked movements (TMS-PVs). To assess the spatial gradient of movement similarity, all TMS-PVs were matched to two randomly selected TMS-PVs obtained through stimulation of (1) the same site or (2) a distant site. The similarity of the resulting pairs of local TMS-PVs was compared with the similarity of the pairs of distant TMS-PVs across all subjects. Although the mean similarity of local TMS-PV pairs was significantly higher (i.e., the distance was smaller) than the similarity of distant TMS-PV pairs (p < 0.001; two-tailed paired t test), the mean similarity differed only by 0.08 ± 0.58 (Figure 2D). This “isotropy” of movement representation on a macroscopic scale is consistent with findings obtained with a large variety of investigational methods ranging from anatomical study (Rathelot and Strick, 2006Rathelot J.A.

Scalp sites from which movements of individual fingers (mostly as part of composite finger movements) could be evoked overlapped extensively. Figure 3A displays the topographical distribution of the movements of each individual finger as summarized by its activation map (see Experimental Procedures). Peak activations were located near the grand center of gravity (CoG) of all finger movements. The location of the CoG of individual fingers is illustrated in Figure 3B. The lateral position of the CoG of different fingers differed significantly [analysis of variance (ANOVA); F(4, 85) = 2.5; p = 0.049]. With reference to the CoG of little finger movements, the CoG of thumb movements was 2.3 ± 3.4 mm (p = 0.011; two-tailed paired t test) more lateral, and the CoG of index finger movements was 3.1 ± 2.8 mm (p < 0.001; two-tailed paired t test) more lateral. The CoGs derived from motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle and adductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle were comparable in distance and location to the CoGs of the corresponding finger movement. The APB muscle was located 3.0 ± 1.5 mm more laterally than the ADM muscle (p < 0.001; two-tailed paired t test). Projected at the level of the cortex, the mean 3D distance of CoGs of thumb and index finger to little finger amounted to ∼3.4–3.7 mm, in excellent agreement with findings obtained from neuroimaging studies (Beisteiner et al., 2001Beisteiner R. Windischberger C. Lanzenberger R. Edward V. Cunnington R. Erdler M. Gartus A. Streibl B. Moser E. Deecke L. Finger somatotopy in human motor cortex.Neuroimage. 2001; 13: 1016-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, Hlustik et al., 2001Hlustik P. Solodkin A. Gullapalli R.P. Noll D.C. Small S.L. Somatotopy in human primary motor and somatosensory hand representations revisited.Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In these studies, the 3D distance obtained after voluntary individual finger movements was found to be ∼1.7–5.4 mm. To obtain a more detailed view of the properties of the output of the primary motor cortex as revealed by TMS, we extended the analysis of individual fingers to the analysis of entire TMS-evoked movements. Although a large variety of movements were evoked by TMS, many movements appeared to share a limited number of mutually similar postures. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to allocate TMS-PVs to posture groups (PGs), which were defined by the minimal distance of their group members. Visualization of these groups revealed that several movements contained motion elements observable in natural motor behavior, such as thumb and index finger opposition or opening and closing of the hand. Examples are shown in Figure 4A, in which 8 (of a total of 73) different PGs derived from TMS-PVs in one subject (AA) are rendered. Figure 4B summarizes the results of the clustering process of the TMS-PVs for all 18 subjects. Across all subjects, the mean number of PGs was 47 ± 17, indicating that TMS-evoked movements exhibited considerable variability. The variability of TMS-PVs was compared with the variability of Structureless-PVs, which were generated from randomly shuffling the TMS-PV components of each subject. TMS-PVs were also compared with movements evoked by magnetic brachial plexus stimulation (as indexed by Plexus-PVs) to illustrate the variability of TMS-evoked movements in relation to movements evoked by synchronous stimulation of a peripheral part of the nervous system. Cluster analysis yielded a different number of PGs for the three conditions (TMS, Structureless-PVs, and Plexus-PVs) in each subject. This is illustrated in Figure 4C, which displays PGs derived from subject AA. For comparison of the results across subjects, the number of PGs was normalized by the total number of PVs to generate a cluster index (CI) that was independent of the total number of PVs. The computed CIs differed significantly between the three conditions [ANOVA; F(2, 15) = 60.50; p < 0.001; Figure 4D]. CIs derived from TMS-PVs were intermediate between those obtained from Structureless-PVs and Plexus-PVs. These results indicate that the variability of TMS-evoked movements is likely to be influenced to a major extent by factors upstream of biomechanics, and thus, probably by neuronal factors related to the organization of the corticospinal system. The reduced variability of TMS-PVs compared to Structureless-PVs suggests that the dimensionality of the movement space spanned by TMS-evoked movements may be smaller than the actual number of recorded joints. This dimensionality reduction would favor the idea that TMS-evoked finger movements arise from the combination of a small set of modules. To infer the degree of modularity explicitly, PCA, a widely used matrix factorization technique, was applied. The extracted kinematic modules, or principal components (PCs), of TMS-PVs can be thought of as hand shape deformations which, scaled by the proper weighting coefficients, can be combined to reconstruct the entire set of TMS-PVs. On average, the first four PCs accounted for ∼89.3% of the variance, with the first two accounting for ∼72.6% of the variance (Figure 5A). Therefore, the dimensionality (as defined by the number of PCs accounting for ≥90% of the variance) inherent in the TMS-PVs amounted to approximately four, a marked reduction compared to the ten-dimensional joint space. In contrast, approximately eight PCs were needed to account for ∼89% of the total variance of Structureless-PVs (Figure 5A). The dimensionality inherent in the TMS-PVs was significantly lower than that inherent in Structureless-PVs (p < 0.001, two-tailed t test). This reduction of dimensionality would indicate a property of cortical motor control, unless the finger joint movements were not already constrained mechanically at the range of motions induced by TMS. Indeed, Lang and Schieber, 2004Lang C.E. Schieber M.H. Human finger independence: limitations due to passive mechanical coupling versus active neuromuscular control.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 2802-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar have demonstrated significant biomechanical constraints for passive large-arc (∼40°–80°) finger movements. To address the possibility that the dimensionality reduction of TMS-PVs could be attributed to biomechanical constraints, we performed passive individuated movements of every single recorded finger joint of the right hand in six subjects. The range of these joint motions was 23.2° ± 2.8° and, thus, considerably larger than that of the TMS-evoked movements (mean range of joint motions 3.9°, see above). PCA of these individuated passive movements showed that eight PCs accounted for ∼90.0% of the variance, similar to the dimensionality inherent in the Structureless-PVs (Figure 5A). Therefore, the dimensionality reduction of finger movements evoked by TMS of primary motor cortex cannot be explained by biomechanical factors. To address the question of similarity between PCs derived from different subjects, best-matching pairs (Cheung et al., 2005Cheung V.C.K. d'Avella A. Tresch M.C. Bizzi E. Central and sensory contributions to the activation and organization of muscle synergies during natural motor behaviors.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6419-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) of PCs were computed (see Experimental Procedures). Figure 5B shows the best-matching PC pairs of two subjects. Note that the members of best-matching PC pairs did not necessarily have the same rank order. A complete overview of the rank order assignments of best-matching pairs of PCs between all subjects is displayed in the 2D histogram of Figure 5C. The PC with rank order 1, PC1, and PC2 showed the best consistency between subjects, i.e., the best-matching counterpart of PC1 from one subject was most often PC1 or PC2 of another subject. In several cases, PC components of a pair of best-matching PCs had a different rank order with regard to the relative amount of variance they explained in each data set. Surprisingly, PC10 of one subject frequently corresponded best to PC10 of another subject. Subsequent detailed analysis revealed a small-amplitude mechanical artifact as the likely origin of this PC. Due to the fact that PC10 accounted for less than 0.1% of the data variance, the above conclusions are not affected by this artifact. In contrast to TMS-PCs, PCs derived from Structureless-PVs did not show any consistent rank order assignments (Figure 5D). Additionally, to quantify the similarity of different sets of PCs, the shared subspace dimensionality (Cheung et al., 2005Cheung V.C.K. d'Avella A. Tresch M.C. Bizzi E. Central and sensory contributions to the activation and organization of muscle synergies during natural motor behaviors.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6419-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) between subjects was computed. A subspace was defined by the first n PCs, where n corresponded to the number of PCs necessary to account for ≥90% of the data variance in each subject. In contrast to best-matching pairs of PCs, this measure is insensitive to variations in the rank order of PCs. Between subjects, the shared subspace dimensionality of PCs derived from TMS-PVs (TMS-PCs) was 2.5 ± 0.8, indicating a substantial overlap when compared with the dimensionality of approximately four PCs necessary to explain ≥90% of the variance (Figure 5E). The shared subspace dimensionality between TMS-PCs exceeded the shared subspace dimensionality between Structureless-PCs (1.4 ± 0.6; p < 0.001, two-tailed t test). Although TMS-PCs between subjects showed considerable overlap, there was also interindividual variability, possibly as a result of differences in the biomechanical properties of the hands, or of interindividual differences in motor control. Therefore, one might predict intraindividual similarity of PCs to be greater than interindividual similarity. To address this issue, five subjects took part in additional mapping sessions 2 months after the first session and 1 week after the second session. Results indicate a high degree of consistency of the rank order of best-matching pairs of PCs in the same subject after three mapping sessions (Figure 6A). PC1 computed from the first session always corresponded best to PC1 in subsequent mapping sessions. Moreover, the shared subspace dimensionality (Figure 6B) was significantly higher intraindividually, between different sessions in the same subject, (3.2 ± 0.7) than interindividually, between subjects, (2.6 ± 0.8; p = 0.007, two-tailed t test). Therefore, the PCs extracted from TMS-evoked movements likely contain individually specific features of movement organization. PCA revealed that modularity was more pronounced in TMS-PVs than in Structureless-PVs and that PCs overlapped considerably between subjects. However, it rema"

Unilateral destruction of the neuronal feedback from the LSO to the cochlea, the lateral olivocochlear efferents, disrupted the normal interaural correlation in response amplitudes to sounds of equal intensity. Thus, lateral olivocochlear feedback maintains the binaural balance in neural excitability required for accurate localization of sounds in space."
https://openalex.org/W1983291122,"Intensity-tuned neurons, characterized by their nonmonotonic response-level function, may play important roles in the encoding of sound intensity-related information. The synaptic mechanisms underlying intensity tuning remain unclear. Here, in vivo whole-cell recordings in rat auditory cortex revealed that intensity-tuned neurons, mostly clustered in a posterior zone, receive imbalanced tone-evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Excitatory inputs exhibit nonmonotonic intensity tuning, whereas with tone intensity increments, the temporally delayed inhibitory inputs increase monotonically in strength. In addition, this delay reduces with the increase of intensity, resulting in an enhanced suppression of excitation at high intensities and a significant sharpening of intensity tuning. In contrast, non-intensity-tuned neurons exhibit covaried excitatory and inhibitory inputs, and the relative time interval between them is stable with intensity increments, resulting in monotonic response-level function. Thus, cortical intensity tuning is primarily determined by excitatory inputs and shaped by cortical inhibition through a dynamic control of excitatory and inhibitory timing."

https://openalex.org/W2076793364,"Zn(2+) is thought to modulate neurotransmission by affecting currents mediated by ligand-gated ion channels and transmitter reuptake by Na(+)-dependent transporter systems. Here, we examined the in vivo relevance of Zn(2+) neuromodulation by producing knockin mice carrying the mutation D80A in the glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha1 subunit gene (Glra1). This substitution selectively eliminates the potentiating effect of Zn(2+) on GlyR currents. Mice homozygous for Glra1(D80A) develop a severe neuromotor phenotype postnatally that resembles forms of human hyperekplexia (startle disease) caused by mutations in GlyR genes. In spinal neurons and brainstem slices from Glra1(D80A) mice, GlyR expression, synaptic localization, and basal glycinergic transmission were normal; however, potentiation of spontaneous glycinergic currents by Zn(2+) was significantly impaired. Thus, the hyperekplexia phenotype of Glra1(D80A) mice is due to the loss of Zn(2+) potentiation of alpha1 subunit containing GlyRs, indicating that synaptic Zn(2+) is essential for proper in vivo functioning of glycinergic neurotransmission."

We have previously shown that both Type I and II IFNs engage the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), resulting in downstream phosphorylation and deactivation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 (eIF4E-binding protein 1). In the current study, we provide direct evidence that such regulation of 4E-BP1 by IFNα or IFNγ results in sequential dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eukaryotic initiation factor-4E and subsequent formation of a functional complex between eukaryotic initiation factor-4E and eukaryotic initiation factor-4G, to allow initiation of mRNA translation. We also demonstrate that the induction of key IFNα- or IFNγ-inducible proteins (ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15) and CXCL10) that mediate IFN responses are enhanced in 4E-BP1 (4E-BP1-/-) knockout MEFs, as compared with wild-type 4E-BP1+/+ MEFs. On the other hand, IFN-dependent transcriptional regulation of the Isg15 and Cxcl10 genes is intact in the absence of 4E-BP1, as determined by real time reverse transcriptase-PCR assays and promoter assays for ISRE and GAS, establishing that 4E-BP1 plays a selective negative regulatory role in IFN-induced mRNA translation. Interestingly, the induction of expression of ISG15 and CXCL10 proteins by IFNs was also strongly enhanced in cells lacking expression of the tuberin (TSC2-/-) or hamartin (TSC1-/-) genes, consistent with the known negative regulatory effect of the TSC1-TSC2 complex on mTOR activation. In other work, we demonstrate that the induction of an IFN-dependent antiviral response is strongly enhanced in cells lacking expression of 4E-BP1 and TSC2, demonstrating that these elements of the IFN-activated mTOR pathway exhibit important regulatory effects in the generation of IFN responses.

In addition, because of their important biological properties, different recombinant IFNs (α, β, and γ) have been used extensively as therapeutic agents in a variety of clinical syndromes in humans, and certain IFN-subtypes are approved for the treatment of human malignancies, viral syndromes, and neurologic diseases (6Parmar S.

Over the years, the mechanisms of IFN signal transduction have been the focus of attention by many research groups and have come under extensive investigation. Since the demonstration of the existence of STAT pathways that regulate transcription of interferon-inducible genes (2Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar, 3Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I. M Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar), there has been gradual accumulation of evidence pointing toward a complicated network of multiple signaling pathways, whose coordinated function is necessary for the generation of IFN biological responses (4Platanias L.C.

Immunol. 2005; 5: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar). For instance, it has now become apparent that, in addition to different combinations of IFN-activated JAKs and STATs, the coordinated function of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways are essential for optimal IFN-dependent transcriptional regulation (5Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar).

To directly address the functional relevance of this pathway in IFN signaling, we used cells from mice with targeted disruption of the 4e-bp1 and Tsc2 genes. Our data demonstrate that up-regulation of expression of key IFN-regulated proteins is enhanced in 4e-bp1 and Tsc2 knock-out cells, whereas there are no changes in IFN-dependent gene transcription, suggesting selective effects on the initiation of cap-dependent translation. Importantly, the generation of IFN-inducible antiviral responses is augmented in cells with targeted disruption of these genes, suggesting important functional roles for these proteins in IFN signaling.

Briefly, cells were transfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector and either an ISRE luciferase construct or a luciferase reporter gene containing eight GAS elements linked to a minimal prolactin promoter (8× GAS), using Superfect transfection reagent as per the manufacturer's recommended procedure (Qiagen). The ISRE luciferase construct containing the wild type ISG15 ISRE (17Uddin S. Majchrzak B. Woodson J. Arunkumar P. Alsayed Y. Pine R. Young P.R. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

The 8× GAS construct was from Dr. Christopher Glass (University of California, San Diego) (33Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T.-M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc.

Antiviral Assays—The antiviral effects of mouse IFNα on mouse embryonic fibroblasts were determined by assaying its activity against encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection as in our previous studies (19Li Y.

It is well established that the translational repressor 4E-BP1 is inactivated in response to phosphorylation by a variety of stimuli (35Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar, 36Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

We have previously shown that different Type I IFNs induce phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on threonines 37/46 and threonine 70 (23Lekmine F. Uddin S. Sassano A. Parmar S. Brachmann S.M. Majchrzak B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27772-27780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and that such phosphorylation may result in its dissociation from eIF4E, as shown indirectly in m7GDP-agarose binding experiments (23Lekmine F. Uddin S. Sassano A. Parmar S. Brachmann S.M. Majchrzak B. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27772-27780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To directly examine the effects of IFNα on the association of eIF4E with eIF4G and 4E-BP1, we performed studies in the IFN-sensitive KT-1 cell line. KT-1 cells were left untreated or treated with human IFNα, and, after cell lysis, lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-eIF4E antibody. After IFNα treatment of the cells, there was an increase in the amounts of eIF4G associated with eIF4E, whereas such enhanced association was blocked by pretreatment of the cells with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or the PI 3′-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, the amount of 4E-BP1 bound to eIF4E decreased dramatically after treatment of cells with IFNα (Fig. 1B). Similar immunoprecipitation experiments were also carried out using IFNγ instead of IFNα. After IFNγ treatment of U2OS cells, there was an increase in the amount of eIF4G associated with eIF4E (Fig. 1D) and a corresponding decrease in the amounts of eIF4E-bound 4E-BP1 protein (Fig. 1E). Such a decrease in the eIF4E-bound 4E-BP1 was reversible by pretreatment of the cells with rapamycin or LY294002 (Fig. 1E), indicating that such an event is also PI 3-kinase-mTOR-dependent. It should be pointed out that we have previously shown that IFNγ induces phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in all sites required for its dissociation from 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46, Ser65, and Thr70) (24Lekmine F. Sassano A. Uddin S. Smith J. Majchrzak B. Brachmann S.M. Hay N. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 295: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The induction of IFN-dependent dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E and association of eIF4G with eIF4E was prolonged and could be detected in long time course experiments (Fig. 1, G–L). Altogether, these studies indicated that dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E during IFNα or IFNγ treatment of sensitive cells results in an enhanced interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G in an mTOR-dependent manner and the formation of the complex that is known to regulate initiation of cap-dependent mRNA translation. We subsequently sought to examine whether engagement of 4E-BP1 in IFN signaling regulates ultimate expression of protein products that participate in the generation of IFN responses. We determined the role of 4E-BP1 in the expression of ISG15, a Type I IFN-induced protein product that mediates IFN responses by regulating ISGylation (38Ritchie K.J. Hahn C.S. Kim K.I. Yan M. Rosario D. Li L. De La Torre J.C. Zhang D.E. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 39Ritchie K.J. Zhang D.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, we examined the role of 4E-BP1 in the expression of CXCL10, a Type II IFN-induced protein product/chemokine that participates in the generation of IFNγ-dependent apoptosis (40Zhang H.M. Yuan J. Cheung P. Chau D. Wong B.W. McManus B.M. Yang D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6247-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we used MEFs from mice with targeted disruption of the 4E-BP1 gene (27Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Poulin F. Kohara M. DeMaria C.T. Cheng A. Wu Z. Gingras A.C. Katsume A. Elchebly M. Spiegelman B.M. Harper M.E. Tremblay M.L. Sonenberg N. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1128-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). 4E-BP1+/+ and 4E-BP1-/- MEFs were incubated in the presence or absence of mouse IFNα, and cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-ISG15 antibody. There was induction of expression of the ISG15 protein in both wild-type and 4E-BP1 knock-out cells, but the induction of expression of ISG15 was stronger in the 4E-BP1-/- MEFs as compared with the +/+ MEFs (Fig. 2, A–C). Similar enhancement of ISG15 expression in 4E-BP1-/- MEFs, as compared with the parental MEFs, was observed when another mouse Type I IFN, IFNβ, was used in similar experiments (Fig. 2, D–F). On the other hand, in experiments in which 4E-BP1 was ectopically reexpressed using a pCDNA3-4e-bp1 construct, we found that such ectopic expression results in partial reversal of the IFNα-inducible expression of ISG15 (Fig. 2, G–J), further demonstrating that 4E-BP1 plays a negative regulatory role on the expression of ISG15 protein by IFNα. It should be pointed out that ectopically expressed 4E-BP1 protein in the knock-out MEFs associated with eIE4E (Fig. 2, K–N), indicating that the reversal of enhanced mRNA translation/protein expression seen in cells lacking 4E-BP1 results from direct inhibitory effects of the ectopically expressed protein on the formation of complexes that regulate cap-dependent translation. Similar to what we observed in the case of ISG15 expression by IFNα, there was stronger IFNγ-inducible expression of the CXCL10 protein in cells with targeted disruption of mouse 4E-BP1, as compared with parental MEFs (Fig. 3, A–C). On the other hand, ectopic reexpression of 4E-BP1 in 4E-BP1-/- MEFs resulted in a decrease in the expression of CXCL10 protein as compared with cells transfected with empty vector alone (Fig. 3, D–G), indicating a negative regulatory effect of 4E-BP1 on CXCL10 expression. The known ability of 4E-BP1 to repress the function of eIF4E, taken together with our findings demonstrating enhanced ISG15 and CXCL10 expression in cells lacking 4E-BP1, strongly suggested that such enhanced expression reflects potentiation of mRNA translation for selected IFN-regulated genes. To exclude the possibility that such enhanced protein expression reflects indirect effects on IFN-dependent gene transcription, luciferase reporter assays were carried out in 4E-BP1+/+ and 4E-BP1-/- MEFs. As shown in Fig. 4, there was no enhancement of IFNα-inducible transcription via ISRE elements (Fig. 4A), nor was there significantly enhanced IFNγ-transcription via GAS elements (Fig. 4B) in 4E-BP1 knock-out cells. Moreover, when the induction of transcription of the Isg15 and Cxcl10 genes was compared in 4E-BP1+/+ and 4E-BP1-/- MEFs using real time RT-PCR, similar levels of induction were observed (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, although induction of ISG15 and CXCL10 protein expression by Type I and II IFNs is enhanced in the absence of 4E-BP1, targeted disruption of the 4e-bp1 gene does not alter IFN-inducible transcription, consistent with a selective effect on the initiation of IFN-dependent mRNA translation. We subsequently sought to evaluate the functional relevance of 4E-BP1 in the generation of IFN responses. A universal property of all different Type I IFNs is their ability to generate antiviral responses in IFN-sensitive cells. We examined the antiviral properties of mouse IFNα4 against EMCV infection in 4E-BP1 knock-out MEFs as compared with parental wild-type MEFs. Interestingly, 4E-BP1-/- cells were more resistant to infection with EMCV, and much higher titers were required to achieve viral infectivity as compared with 4E-BP1+/+ cells (Fig. 5). Most importantly, despite the fact that much higher viral titers were used in such experiments in the 4E-BP1-/- cells (1:50 dilution) compared with wild-type MEFs (1:1000 dilution), the sensitivity of these cells to the an"
https://openalex.org/W2017879027,"In germ line cells, recombination is required for gene reassortment and proper chromosome segregation at meiosis, whereas in somatic cells it provides an important mechanism for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Five proteins (RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3) that share homology with RAD51 recombinase and are known as the RAD51 paralogs are important for recombinational repair, as paralog-defective cell lines exhibit spontaneous chromosomal aberrations, defective DNA repair, and reduced gene targeting. The paralogs form two distinct protein complexes, RAD51B-RAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 and RAD51C-XRCC3, but their precise cellular roles remain unknown. Here, we show that, like MLH1, RAD51C localized to mouse meiotic chromosomes at pachytene/diplotene. Using immunoprecipitation and gel filtration analyses, we found that Holliday junction resolvase activity associated tightly and co-eluted with the 80-kDa RAD51C-XRCC3 complex. Taken together, these data indicate that the RAD51C-XRCC3-associated Holliday junction resolvase complex associates with crossovers and may play an essential role in the resolution of recombination intermediates prior to chromosome segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2033745197,"Post-translational modification by protein prenylation is required for membrane targeting and biological function of monomeric GTPases. Ras and Rho proteins possess a C-terminal CAAX motif (C is cysteine, A is usually an aliphatic residue, and X is any amino acid), in which the cysteine is prenylated, followed by proteolytic cleavage of the AAX peptide and carboxyl methylation by the Rce1 CAAX protease and Icmt methyltransferase, respectively. Rab GTPases usually undergo double geranylgeranylation within CC or CXC motifs. However, very little is known about processing and membrane targeting of Rabs that naturally contain a CAAX motif. We show here that a variety of Rab-CAAX proteins undergo carboxyl methylation, both in vitro and in vivo, with one exception. Rab38(CAKS) is not methylated in vivo, presumably because of the inhibitory action of the lysine residue within the AAX motif for cleavage by Rce1. Unlike farnesylated Ras proteins, we observed no targeting defects of overexpressed Rab-CAAX proteins in cells deficient in Rce1 or Icmt, as reported for geranylgeranylated Rho proteins. However, endogenous geranylgeranylated non-methylated Rab-CAAX and Rab-CXC proteins were significantly redistributed to the cytosol at steady-state levels and redistribution correlates with higher affinity of RabGDI for non-methylated Rabs in Icmt-deficient cells. Our data suggest a role for methylation in Rab function by regulating the cycle of Rab membrane recruitment and retrieval. Our findings also imply that those Rabs that undergo post-prenylation processing follow an indirect targeting pathway requiring initial endoplasmic reticulum membrane association prior to specific organelle targeting.

Our findings also imply that those Rabs that undergo post-prenylation processing follow an indirect targeting pathway requiring initial endoplasmic reticulum membrane association prior to specific organelle targeting. Protein prenylation involves the covalent addition of either farnesyl (15-carbon) or geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) isoprenoids onto C-terminal cysteines via thioether linkages and is necessary for proteins to associate with cellular membranes to carry out intracellular functions (1Lane K.T. Beese L.S. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 681-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2Leung K.F. Baron R. Seabra M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Among the proteins that are modified by prenylation are small GTPases such as Ras, Rho, and Rab family proteins, all of which require prenylation for activity. Three distinct protein prenyltransferases have been identified, all of which are heterodimeric enzymes made up of an α and β subunit (1Lane K.T. Beese L.S. J.

The CAAX 5The abbreviations used are: CAAX, C is cysteine, A is aliphatic residue, X is any amino acid; Icmt, isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; RGGT, Rab geranylgeranyltransferase; REP, Rab escort protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; PIPES, 1, 4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. prenyltransferases, consisting of farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase type I, modify proteins with a C-terminal CAAX motif, where C is cysteine, A is usually an aliphatic residue, and X is any amino acid. When X is a methionine, serine, glutamine, or alanine, the substrate is farnesylated, whereas if it is a leucine or phenylalanine, the substrate is geranylgeranylated. Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (RGGT, also known as geranylgeranyltransferase type II) forms a different class of protein prenyltransferases. RGGT specifically modifies Rab proteins but only when they are in complex with an accessory protein known as Rab escort protein (REP) (2Leung K.F. Baron R. Seabra M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 467-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). There are two proposed mechanisms for Rab protein prenylation. In the classical pathway, newly synthesized Rab binds REP, which presents the Rab to RGGT (3Andres D.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Armstrong S.A. Smeland T.E. Cremers F.P. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1091-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Alternatively, REP can associate with RGGT and the complex can bind to unprenylated Rab (4Thoma N.H. Iakovenko A. Goody R.S. Alexandrov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48637-48643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The enzyme then catalyzes the sequential addition of geranylgeranyl groups onto two C-terminal cysteines of the Rab protein. Finally, RGGT dissociates and REP is thought to deliver the prenylated Rab protein to membranes (5Seabra M.C. Wasmeier C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Following prenylation, CAAX-containing Ras and Rho GTPases are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and undergo proteolytic cleavage of the AAX tripeptide, catalyzed by the CAAX protease, Ras, and a-factor converting enzyme (Rce1) (6Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 7Wright L.P. Philips M.R. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 883-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The newly exposed prenylated cysteine is then further modified by carboxyl methylation on the α-carboxyl group by isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (Icmt), which is also located on the ER (6Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 7Wright L.P. Philips M.R. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 883-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Carboxyl methylation enhances the hydrophobicity of the C terminus of prenylated proteins, although this effect is more apparent in farnesylated proteins than in geranylgeranylated proteins (8Michaelson D. Ali W. Chiu V.K. Bergo M. Silletti J. Wright L. Young S.G. Philips M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1606-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Silvius J.R. l'Heureux F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The importance of post-prenylation processing has been exemplified by studies using gene-targeted inactivation, where it was found that mice deficient in Rce1 (10Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) or Icmt (11Bergo M.O. Leung G.K. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Casey P.J. Gomes A.Q. Seabra M.C. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) are embryonic lethal. Interestingly, Icmt-/- mice exhibited a more severe phenotype, which could be explained by the fact that Icmt may have more substrates than Rce1. Indeed, Rab proteins with a CXC motif are methylated on the C-terminal prenylcysteine, although the role of methylation in Rab proteins is unclear (12Smeland T.E. Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10712-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated the importance of methylation and its role in the membrane association of many CAAX proteins, in particular Ras proteins. In cells deficient in Rce1 and Icmt, Ras proteins exhibit a significant decrease in membrane association (10Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the absence of methylation results in mislocalization of Ras from the plasma membrane. Consistent with its role in membrane association, methylation appears to regulate downstream signaling pathways of Ras through its localization. The Icmt small substrate inhibitor, N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine, blocks EGF-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, a downstream target of EGF signaling and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and Raf-1 kinases (13Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Dinsell V. Wiener H. Loukeris K. Ou G. Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7346-7352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), although N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine-mediated effects have to be interpreted carefully given that some effects are unrelated to Icmt inhibition (6Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Another Icmt-specific inhibitor, cysmethynil, also leads to mislocalization of Ras proteins and blocks EGF-induced stimulation of MAPK and Akt (6Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The majority of Rab proteins possess a di-cysteine motif such as CC, CXC, or CCXX, and both cysteines are modified by geranylgeranyl lipid groups. However, a few possess a CAAX motif, such as Rab8 and Rab13, and are modified by a single geranylgeranyl moiety (14Joberty G. Tavitian A. Zahraoui A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The reason why some Rabs are monoprenylated is not known, but the presence of a CAAX motif suggests that they have the potential to be processed by CAAX proteolysis and carboxyl methylation. In this study, we addressed the post-prenylation processing of single cysteine Rabs. We reveal for the first time that Rab-CAAX proteins are carboxyl methylated both in vitro and in vivo. In the absence of CAAX processing by Rce1 or Icmt, the localization of Rab-CAAX proteins is unaffected. However, the cycle of membrane association and retrieval is affected with decreased levels of membrane-associated Rabs, suggesting a role for methylation in regulating Rab activity. Plasmid Constructs—pEGFP-Rab11a was a kind gift of James Goldenring (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN). pEGFP-mRab23 was a kind gift from Carol Wicking (University of Queensland, Australia) (from here on, mRab23 will be referred to as Rab23). pEGFP-Rab8aGGCC, pEGFPRab8aGCSC, pEGFP-Rab38CALS, and pEGFP-Rab38CAVS were generated using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system, as described previously (15Gomes A.Q.

Cell. 2003; 14: 1882-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). pGEX-4T-1-Rab13, Rab18, and Rab23 were generated by PCR amplification of the Rab cDNA of interest and cloned into pGEX-4T-1 vector using EcoRI-SalI, EcoRI-XhoI, and EcoRI-XhoI, respectively. Human RabGDIβ was amplified by PCR from a cDNA library (MHS1011, Invitrogen) and cloned into pFastBac-HTB using NcoI-XbaI. The sequences of all plasmid constructs used were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant GST-Rab5a, GST-Rab13, GST-Rab18, GST-Rab23, and GST-Rab38 were expressed in BL21 cells and purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). Recombinant RGGT and REP1 were prepared by infection of Sf9 cells with recombinant baculoviruses encoding each subunit of the desired enzyme and purified by nickel-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (16Armstrong S.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Seabra M.C. James G.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human RabGDIβ was prepared by infection of Sf9 cells with recombinant baculovirus using standard procedures. Briefly, baculoviruses were generated following subcloning of RabGDIβ into pFastBac-HTB using the Bac-to-Bac® system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Recombinant histidine (His)-tagged RabGDIβ was produced as follows. After a 96-h infection with P4 viral stock, Sf9 cells were centrifuged at 800 × g and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% Triton X-100, Roche complete protease inhibitor mixture). After sonication, the solution was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C.The supernatant was incubated for 90 min with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) at 4 °C. The beads (3 ml) were first washed with 100 ml of lysis buffer and then with 100 ml of the same buffer without detergent. Recombinant His-RabGDIβ was eluted from the beads with a gradient of imidazole (0-250 mm). The eluate was dialyzed overnight in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and purity judged by SDS-PAGE. All recombinant proteins were more than 70% pure, snap frozen in small aliquots, and stored at -80 °C until use. Antibodies—Anti-GFP polyclonal rabbit antibody (Ab290, Abcam) was used at 1-2 μl/tube for immunoprecipitation. Texas Red-X phalloidin (T-7471, Molecular Probes) was used at 1:1000 dilution for immunofluorescence according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-human Rab8 and Rab11 monoclonal antibodies (numbers 610844 and 610656, BD Transduction Laboratories) for immunoblotting were used at 1:1000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polyclonal anti-Rab7 was a gift of J. Gruenberg (University of Geneva, Switzerland). Anti-RabGDI antibody was obtained after purification of rabbit serum raised against full-length rat RabGDIβ. The antibody recognizes both RabGDI isoforms with a higher potency against the β-isoform. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 10% CO2. Wild type and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) null for Rce1 and Icmt were kind gifts from Steve Young (UCLA) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells used in immunofluorescence experiments were grown on 24-well plated coverslips for 24 h, transfected, and fixed after 24 h (HeLa and HEK 293 cells). Cells used for subcellular fractionation were grown in 10-cm dishes, transfected, and homogenized 24 h after transfection. HeLa cells and HEK 293 cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RBL cells were transfected by electroporation. Briefly, following trypsinization, cells were resuspended at 107 cells in 250 μl and placed in an electrocuvette with 10 μg of plasmid DNA. After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, cells were electroporated at 250 mV, 960 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser and returned to 4 °C for a further 10 min. Electroporated cells were then cultured on coverslips in a 10-cm dish containing 10 ml of medium. Cells were then fixed 24-48 h later using 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. In Vitro Methylation Assay—In vitro prenylation of GST-Rab proteins was performed in 25-μl reaction volumes in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 μl of cold geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) to a final concentration of 20 μm. Each reaction contained 10 μm GST-Rab protein substrate and prenylation was initiated by the addition of 2 μm REP1 and 50 nm RGGT recombinant and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Following prenylation, 62.5 μg of Rce1 and/or 15 μg of Icmt Sf9 membranes (kind gifts from Patrick Casey, Duke University) were added to each condition, together with 0.5 μl of the methyl donor [3H]S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) (700 cpm/pmol) and cold AdoMet to a final concentration of 10 μm, in a final volume of 30 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min and terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 10% Triton X-100 in PBS. 15 μl of glutathione beads in 500 μl of PBS were added to each condition and allowed to bind on a rotator for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 s, the supernatant was discarded, and the beads were washed three times in PBS. Finally, the beads were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, transferred directly into a scintillation vial containing 4 ml of scintillation fluid, and the disintegrations per minute (dpm) were counted using a scintillation counter. In Vivo Carboxyl Methylation of Proteins in Cultured Cells—In vivo methylation assay was performed as described previously (18Newman C.M. Giannakouros T. Hancock J.F. Fawell E.H. Armstrong J. Magee A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11329-11336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells transfected with pEGFP plasmids for 8 h were first incubated in methionine-free medium (R7513, Sigma) for 1 h. They were then incubated in 1:9 complete medium:methionine-free medium made up to 5% fetal bovine serum, along with 200 μCi of l-[methyl-3H]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) overnight. The following day, cells were harvested mechanically, transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The cells were resuspended in 200 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) for 10 min to allow lysis to occur. This was followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was transferred to a fresh tube. 2 μl of anti-GFP antibody (Abcam) was added to the PNS and the solution was mixed on a rotator at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, 10 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads (in a 1:1 slurry of in RIPA buffer) were added to the PNS at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, to remove excess detergents. The protein-antibody complexes were subjected to electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were then immersed in a solution containing 10% acetic acid and 45% methanol for 5 min to ensure fixation of the proteins, and then re-hydrated in water. This was followed by immersion in 1 m sodium salicylate for 20 min, after which the gels were immediately vacuum-dried on blotting paper. Detection of radiolabeled proteins was performed using autoradiographic film and exposed after 3-4 days. The radioactive bands of interest were excised and methyl-esterified proteins were detected by an alkali hydrolysis/diffusion assay as described previously (19Chelsky D. Gutterson N.I. Koshland Jr., D.E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Open tubes containing the gel piece were lowered into scintillation vials containing scintillation fluid. 1 m NaOH was added to each tube to immerse the gel piece and the vial was capped immediately, leaving the tube open inside. The vials were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Ester-linked methyl groups were hydrolytically cleaved by alkali, releasing [3H]methanol, which is distilled into the scintillation fluid. Following treatment with alkali, each Eppendorf tube was carefully removed and the vial containing alkali-labile methanol was capped. An equal volume of 1 m HCl was added to the Eppendorf tube to neutralize the alkali and the contents were transferred to a fresh vial containing scintillation fluid. This latter vial contained alkali-stable [3H]methionine that was incorporated into the peptide backbone. The amount of radioactivity in the alkali-labile and alkali-stable samples was measured using a scintillation counter with a tritium channel. To determine whether a protein was methylated in vivo, the methylation stoichiometry was calculated by the following equation: (alkali-labile dpm × number of methionine residues in the protein)/alkali-stable dpm. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—After transfection with pEGFP plasmids, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated in permeabilization buffer (80 mm K-PIPES, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (w/v) saponin) for 5 min and then fixed in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Excess fixative was removed by repeated washing in PBS. When Texas Red phalloidin was used, cells were further incubated for 15 min in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% saponin. The subsequent steps were performed in this solution. The cells were incubated with Texas Red phalloidin for 30 min and washed three times. The coverslips were mounted in ImmunoFluor medium (ICN, Basingstoke, Hants, United Kingdom) and the fluorescence was visualized using a DM-IRBE Leica confocal microscope. Images were processed using TCS-NT software associated with the microscope and Adobe Photoshop 5.5 software. All images presented are single sections in the z-plane and are representative of at least 80% of the transfected cells in the coverslip. Temperature Block Experiments—Temperature block experiments were performed as described previously (15Gomes A.Q. Ali B.R. Ramalho J.S. Godfrey R.F. Barral D.C. Hume A.N. Seabra M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1882-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates and grown overnight as described above. The following day, cells were transfected and 4 h later, the medium was replaced with complete medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES buffer (15630-056; Invitrogen) and cells were placed at 20 °C for 3 h to block exit of proteins from the Golgi apparatus. Cells were fixed at this point or further incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. All cells were permeabilized and fixed as described above. Subcellular Fractionation—After transfection, HEK 293 cells were harvested mechanically, transferred to 15-ml tubes, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and centrifuged once more. Cells were then resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, Roche complete protease inhibitor mixture) and lysed by sonication, followed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The PNS was transferred to a Beckman centrifuge tube and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C using a TLA45 Beckman rotor. The supernatant (S100) containing the cytosolic fraction was transferred to a fresh tube and the pellet (P100) containing the membrane fraction was resuspended in an equivalent volume of lysis buffer. The fractions were subjected to electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and proteins were detected by Western immunoblotting. Densitometry quantification was achieved using Fuji Film Intelligent Dark Box LAS-3000 and Aida Image Analyze 3.52 software. RabGDI Extraction Assay—Membrane proteins (30 μg) prepared from MEFs in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 1 mm GDP, and Roche complete protease inhibitor mixture, were incubated with increasing amounts of purified His-RabGDIβ (0-8 μm) for 20 min at 37 °C. The extracted Rab proteins in complex with RabGDIβ were separated from membrane proteins by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The soluble fraction (S100) and the membrane fraction (P100) were resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gel Filtration Chromatography—S100 (100 μg) fractions prepared as above were loaded onto a Superdex 200 3.2/30 column using a SMART system (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm GDP, at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. The samples (50 μl) were injected, and the material eluting between 0.8 and 2 ml was collected in 50-μl fractions. In Vitro Carboxyl Methylation of Rab-CAAX Proteins—To determine whether Rab proteins that naturally possess a CAAX motif are substrates for Rce1 and Icmt in vitro, recombinant GST-Rab fusion proteins were produced after expression in Escherichia coli. Because prenylation and proteolysis are required for Icmt-dependent methylation, the in vitro assay was designed as a coupled prenylation/proteolysis/methylation assay. Geranylgeranylation reactions of GST-Rab substrates were performed in the presence of recombinant RGGT and recombinant REP1, followed by the addition of Rce1 and Icmt-enriched membrane fractions to initiate AAX proteolysis and carboxyl methylation, respectively. Subsequently, proteins were isolated using glutathione beads and the amount of [3H]AdoMet incorporated was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Rab18 was used initially as a model Rab protein with a CAAX motif for the in vitro methylation assays to determine optimal conditions. We found that GST-Rab18 methylation was strictly dependent on REP1 and RGGT (Fig. 1A). This is consistent with the fact that both Rce1 and Icmt only modify prenylated substrates. The incorporation of [3H]AdoMet increased with time to over 14 pmol after 60 min following the addition of Rce1, Icmt, and [3H]AdoMet. The yield was calculated to be ∼5%, taking into account the estimate that 10-30% of the total protein was prenylated. 6K. F. Leung, R. Baron, B. R. Ali, A. I. Magee, and M. C. Seabra, unpublished observations. GST-Rab18 showed an attenuated level of methylation in the presence of either Rce1 or Icmt alone. The reduced methylation is most likely due to the endogenous levels of both proteins present in the enriched membrane preparations used in the assay. The methylation status of GST-Rab18 was compared with that of other candidate Rab proteins possessing a CAAX motif (GST-Rab13, GST-Rab23, and GST-Rab38) (Fig. 1B). The results suggest that GST-Rab13, GST-Rab18, GST-Rab23, and GST-Rab38 were all carboxyl methylated to the same extent, suggesting that they are all substrates for Rce1 and Icmt (Fig. 1B). As a negative control, GST-Rab18 was mixed with Triton X-100 prior to addition of Rce1 and Icmt, which solubilizes these integral membrane proteins and abolishes their activity. As expected, no methylation was observed for GST-Rab18 when Triton X-100 was included prior to addition of Rce1 and Icmt membranes. GST-Rab5a was used as a control because it is doubly geranylgeranylated on adjacent cysteines, and therefore expected not to be a substrate for either Rce1 or Icmt (12Smeland T.E. Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10712-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As expected, GST-Rab5a showed no significant methylation under the same conditions in vitro. We conclude that GST-Rab13, GST-Rab18, GST-Rab23, and GST-Rab38 are carboxyl methylated in vitro. In Vivo Carboxyl Methylation of Rab Proteins—To investigate whether carboxyl methylation of CAAX-containing Rab proteins occurred in vivo, HEK 293 cells were transfected with EGFP-Rab constructs and labeled with l-[methyl-3H]methionine. The EGFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Because l-[methyl-3H]methionine is used to synthesize both the AdoMet pool and the tRNA-methionine pool in cells, an alkali hydrolysis assay was used to differentiate between methylated versus non-methylated proteins (18Newman C.M. Giannakouros T. Hancock J.F. Fawell E.H. Armstrong J. Magee A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11329-11336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methyl esters are subject to hydrolysis in the presence of alkali, releasing vapor phase [3H]methanol. Labeled methionines in the protein backbone are insensitive to this treatment and thus are differentiated from the labeled methyl groups. As a positive control, we used EGFP-Rac1 (C-terminal sequence, CLLL) which is known to be methylated (20Ando S. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Hiraoka K. Nishiyama T. Mizuno"
https://openalex.org/W1964413617,"Sequence differences between members of the mouse olfac-tory receptor MOR42 subfamily (MOR42-3 and MOR42-1) are likely to be the basis for variation in ligand binding preference among these receptors. We investigated the specificity of MOR42-3 for a variety of dicarboxylic acids. We used site-directed mutagenesis, guided by homology modeling and ligand docking studies, to locate functionally important residues. Receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and assayed using high throughput electrophysiology. The importance of the Val-113 residue, located deep within the receptor, was analyzed in the context of interhelical interactions. We also screened additional residues predicted to be involved in ligand binding site, based on comparison of ortholog/paralog pairs from the mouse and human olfactory receptor genomes (Man, O., Gilad, Y., and Lancet, D. (2004) Protein Sci. 13, 240–254). A network of 8 residues in transmembrane domains III, V, and VI was identified. These residues form part of the ligand binding pocket of MOR42-3. C12 dicarboxylic acid did not activate the receptor in our functional assay, yet our docking simulations predicted its binding site in MOR42-3. Binding without activation implied that C12 dicarboxylic acid might act as an antagonist. In our functional assay, C12 dicarboxylic acid did indeed act as an antagonist of MOR42-3, in agreement with molecular docking studies. Our results demonstrate a powerful approach based on the synergy between computational predictions and physiological assays.

Our results demonstrate a powerful approach based on the synergy between computational predictions and physiological assays. The interaction between a receptor and its molecular partner (the ligand) is a fundamental biological mechanism. In the olfactory system, this interaction is the interface between the central nervous system and environmental cues regarding food and danger and represents the first step in the complex perception of odor. Olfactory sensory neurons, the only true neurons in direct contact with the environment (2Zelano C. Sobel N. Neuron. 2005; 48: 431-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), reside in the main olfactory epithelium and express olfactory receptors (ORs) 2The abbreviations used are: OR, odorant receptor; MOR, mouse OR; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; TM, transmembrane. 2The abbreviations used are: OR, odorant receptor; MOR, mouse OR; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; TM, transmembrane. (3Buck L. Axel R. Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3625) Google Scholar). Binding of odorant ligands to these receptors triggers a signal transduction cascade that leads to olfactory sensory neuron activation and subsequent activation of neurons in the olfactory bulb and the olfactory cortex (4Schild D. Restrepo D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 429-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Most odors are composed of multiple odorant molecules, and each odorant molecule is thought to activate several odorant receptors. This forms a combinatorial code and represents a basis for odorant recognition (5Malnic B. Hirono J. Sato T. Buck L.B. Cell. 1999; 96: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Each olfactory sensory neuron expresses only one of the ∼1000 different ORs (6Lewcock J.W. Reed R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 7Serizawa S. Ishii T. Nakatani H. Tsuboi A. Nagawa F. Asano M. Sudo K. Sakagami J. Sakano H. Ijiri T.

Sakano H. Science. 2003; 302: 2088-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and typically responds to more than one odorant molecule (5Malnic B. Hirono J. Sato T. Buck L.B. Cell. 1999; 96: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar) with temporally patterned bursts of action potentials (9Duchamp-Viret P. Duchamp A. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1997; 53: 561-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The axons of olfactory sensory neurons expressing the same OR converge onto distinct locations in the olfactory bulb (10Firestein S. Nature. 2001; 413: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 11Mombaerts P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus, the ligand specificities of individual ORs are key determinants in olfactory coding and the perception of odor. What determines the differences in ligand specificity among ORs? A hypothesis is that a group of specific residues that differ among receptors forms the basis for ligand specificity. The differences in ligand specificity among ORs have been attributed to differences in the highly variable transmembrane domains (3Buck L. Axel R. Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3625) Google Scholar). Computational analysis of amino acid variability among 197 ORs from 5 different species showed that a majority of the highly variable residues are present in 3 of the 7 transmembrane domains (TM III, IV, and V) (12Pilpel Y. Lancet D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), indicating a potential recognition site for a large variety of odorants.Mammalian ORs belong to the rhodopsin-like family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with a 7-transmembrane domain helix bundle arrangement and sharing several sequence motifs and a number of highly conserved amino acids in the transmembrane domains (TMs) (13Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Mouse ORs (MORs) share some of these common motifs, as well as several OR-specific motifs (14Zhang X. Firestein S. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The low overall sequence identity (∼25%) among rhodopsin-like GPCRs suggests that significant deviations can occur in ligand binding pockets and in inter-helical contacts and makes the study of GPCR ligand binding sites particularly challenging. A variety of approaches have been used to identify functionally important residues within receptor proteins, such as correlated mutation analysis (15Oliveira L. Paiva A.C. Vriend G. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 1010-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), sequence-based entropy (16Suel G.M. Lockless S.W. Wall M.A. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), modeling of receptor ligand binding (17Hobrath J.V. Wang S. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 4470-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the evolutionary trace method (18Madabushi S. Yao H. Marsh M. Kristensen D.M. Philippi A. Sowa M.E. Lichtarge O. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Several studies have used homology modeling and ligand docking approaches to predict the binding site in mammalian ORs (19Singer M.S. Oliveira L. Vriend G. Shepherd G.M. Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 89-95PubMed Google Scholar, 20Singer M.S. Chem. Senses. 2000; 25: 155-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Vaidehi N. Floriano W.B. Trabanino R. Hall S.E. Freddolino P.

Senses. 2004; 29: 595-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Functional specificity of proteins is assumed to be conserved among orthologs and different among paralogs. This assumption was used to identify residues that determine specificity of protein-ligand recognition sites (1Man O. Gilad Y. Lancet D. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 240-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To date, only one study has combined computational and functional approaches to elucidate the structure of the ligand binding site of a mammalian OR, the mouse eugenol receptor (24Katada S. Hirokawa T. Oka Y. Suwa M. Touhara K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1806-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).Here we report the structural basis for ligand specificity of an OR (MOR42-3) by combining functional analysis and site-directed mutagenesis with homology modeling and ligand docking studies. MOR42-3 is closely related to MOR42-1, and both of these receptors respond to aliphatic dicarboxylic acids. However, these two receptors are differentially sensitive to odorant ligands on the basis of carbon chain length, with MOR42-3 preferring the 9-carbon nonanedioic acid and MOR42-1 preferring the 10-carbon decanedioic acid and 11-carbon undecanedioic acid (25Abaffy T. Matsunami H. Luetje C.W. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1506-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This discrete difference in ligand specificity and the high level of sequence identity between these receptors (97% within the transmembrane domains) allowed us to introduce mutations in MOR42-3 that changed ligand preferences. By developing a homology model of MOR42-3, based on the structure of rhodopsin (26Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), we can localize the critical residues identified in our mutagenesis studies and use this model as a target for molecular docking studies. In addition to providing insight into the interaction of agonists with MOR42-3, these ligand-docking studies also predict an antagonist of MOR42-3, a result confirmed by functional analysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Xenopus laevis frogs were purchased from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, WI). The care and use of X. laevis frogs in this study were approved by the University of Miami Animal Research Committee and meet the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health. The human Gαolf construct in the pcDNA3.1 vector was purchased from the University of Missouri-Rolla cDNA Resource Center. The human CFTR clone was kindly provided by Dr. Ian Dickerson (University of Rochester). Chemicals (including odorants) were from Sigma-Aldrich.Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced using the Quik-Change II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each mutant construct was verified by sequencing.Expression of Wild-type and Mutant Mouse Odorant Receptors in Xenopus Oocytes—Our method for functional expression of MORs in Xenopus oocytes has been described previously (25Abaffy T. Matsunami H. Luetje C.W. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1506-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA encoding each receptor (MOR42-1, MOR42-3, and various mutants of MOR42-3) are in the pCI vector (Promega) containing the 20-amino acid N-terminal sequence of human rhodopsin. This “rhodopsin tag” is required for functional expression of MOR42-3 and MOR42-1 in Xenopus oocytes (24Katada S. Hirokawa T. Oka Y. Suwa M. Touhara K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1806-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus, all wild-type and mutant MORs in our study contain this N-terminal sequence extension. Capped cRNA encoding each protein was generated using mMessage mMachine kits (Ambion, Austin, TX). 25 ng of cRNA encoding an MOR, together with 10 ng of Gαolf and 1 ng of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator cRNAs, was injected into each oocyte. Oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in Barth's saline (in mm: 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.3 CaNO3, 0.41 CaCl2, 0.82 MgSO4, 15 HEPES, pH 7.6, and 12 μg/ml tetracycline) for 2–5 days prior to electrophysiological recording. Receptor expression as measured by current amplitude is highly variable in Xenopus oocytes. For this reason, we present our results as a ratio of responses (odorant/odorant, odorant/isobutylmethylxanthine, etc.). Current responses of mutant receptors (in relation to isobutylmethylxanthine responses) were not different from wild-type MOR42-3 and MOR42-1.Electrophysiology and Data Analysis—Odorant-induced Cl- currents, resulting from cAMP-induced activation of co-expressed cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, were measured 2–5 days after cRNA injection using two-electrode voltage clamp in an automated parallel electrophysiology system (OpusExpress 6000A; Molecular Devices). Micropipettes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.2–2.0 MΩ. The holding potential was -70 mV. Current responses, filtered (4-pole, Bessel, low pass) at 20 Hz (-3 db) and sampled at 100 Hz, were captured and stored using OpusXpress 1.1 software (Molecular Devices). Initial analysis was done using Clampfit 9.1 software (Molecular Devices). Oocytes were perfused with ND96 (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.5). Odorants were stored under argon, and high concentration stock solutions (usually 1 m) of each odorant were freshly prepared in ethanol or Me2SO on the day of each experiment. Each odorant, diluted in ND96, was applied for 15 s (24Katada S. Hirokawa T. Oka Y. Suwa M. Touhara K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1806-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were done using Prism 4 (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was assessed using a two-tailed unpaired t test, a one-tailed paired ratio t test, or a one-way analysis of variance followed by the Dunnett's post-test, as appropriate.Homology Modeling—Structural models of the MOR42-3 receptor were generated using MODELLER 8v1 (27Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10384) Google Scholar). This program, which uses spatial constraints derived from an existing atomic structure to model homologous proteins, is widely used for comparative protein modeling. Sequence alignment of MOR42-3 with rhodopsin, MORs 42–1 and 42–2, and 12 other representative GPCRs from the rhodopsin-like family A was done with ClustalW and manually improved. The 2.2 Å resolution crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1U19) (26Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar) was used as a template to get initial coordinates for MOR42-3. This structure was then subjected to energy refinement in MODELLER with three cycles of conjugate gradient and simulated annealing to get a stereochemically plausible model. Fifteen models were generated using different random starting coordinates, and the model with the lowest modeler objective function was used.An important consideration in our homology modeling was the location of the disulfide bond between extracellular loop 2 and the N-terminal end of TM3, which is conserved among receptors that belong to the rhodopsin family. This constraint was explicitly imposed and monitored during model refinement. Disulfide bonds are possible between several cysteine pairs, and we used modeling to sort through these combinations. The DISULFIND program (disulfind.dsi.unifi.it/) (28Vullo A. Frasconi P. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) initially predicted disulfide bonds between Cys-76-Cys-193, Cys-101-Cys-183, Cys-107-Cys-131, and Cys-116-Cys-173. From these, only the Cys-101-Cys-183 pair gave a model with an acceptable geometry and a low objective function. BLAST analysis showed that the Cys-101 could bind either Cys-173, Cys-183, or Cys-193; these three cysteines are conserved not only in the MOR42 subfamily but also in most mouse (14Zhang X. Firestein S. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) and human ORs (29Zozulya S. Echeverri F. Nguyen T. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (RESEARCH0018)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We generated homology models with an explicit disulfide bond between residues 101–173, 101–183, or 101–193. Because all three models had acceptable distances between the relevant Cα atoms (8.1, 6.5, and 5.5 A; an ideal disulfide bond has an α-carbon-α-carbon distance under 8 Å.), they were evaluated by DOPE (MODELLER)) and PROCHECK (nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVS/) (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The model with a disulfide bond between residues 101–171 had the best geometry and the lowest modeler objective function and was chosen for further refinement. The relative orientation of the transmembrane helices is not affected by our choice of the 101–171 disulfide bond.The structure was inspected with PROCHECK for inappropriate stereochemistry (clashing side chains, disallowed torsion angles, etc.). Based on the results of the PROCHECK analysis, several residues (Ile-178, Leu-198, Leu-213, Lys-322, Ser-328, Ser-97, Ile-96, and Thr-320) were manually adjusted using the O software package (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). Further minimization was then carried out using the CNS software package (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar), with three cycles of conjugate gradient. This final model was also evaluated using MODELLER 8v1 to calculate the DOPE score (the energy profile graph of each residue). Both the DOPE score and PRO-CHECK confirm that our model is of high quality, with scores comparable with that of template structure (-48052 for rhodopsin versus -42544 for MOR42-3).Docking Analysis—Molecular docking of ligands into the OR homology model was carried out using the AUTODOCK v3.0 program with the Lamarckian genetic algorithm search method (33Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Ruth Huey W.W. Hart R.K. Olson B.A.A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8957) Google Scholar). The receptor was kept rigid, while the ligand was allowed to be flexible and translate/rotate. Polar hydrogens were added to the receptor, and Kollman-united atom partial charges along with atomic solvation parameters were assigned to individual protein atoms. The three-dimensional structure of each ligand was generated using the PRODRG program (33Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Ruth Huey W.W. Hart R.K. Olson B.A.A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8957) Google Scholar) (davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/cgi-bin/prodrg). Ligands were drawn using the JME molecular editor and then energy minimized with GROMOS (34van Gunsteren W.F. Mark A.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 947-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For each ligand, a rigid root and rotatable bonds were assigned automatically, except for C8–C12 dioic acids where the C–C bond next to the carboxylic group was set as non-rotatable. For each ligand the non-polar hydrogens were removed and the partial charges from these were added to the carbon (Gasteiger charges). The atom type for aromatic carbons (in 1,4 phenylene dipropionic acid) was reassigned in order to use the AUTODOCK aromatic carbon grid map. Docking was carried out using a 80 × 80 × 80 grid points with a default spacing of 0.375 Å. The grid was positioned to include the full ligand binding pocket in the central part of the OR and to allow extensive sampling around residue Val-113. Within this grid, the Lamarckian genetic search algorithm was used with a population size of 150 individuals, calculated using 100 different runs (i.e. 100 dockings). Each run had two stop criteria, a maximum of 2.7 × 106 energy evaluations or a maximum of 27,000 generations, starting from a random position and conformation; default parameters were used for the Lamarck-ian genetic algorithm search.RESULTSInitial Mutation Screen of MOR42-3—The overall sequence identity between MOR42-3 and MOR42-1 is 89%. However, within the transmembrane region (encompassing TMs I–VII, as well as the intracellular and extracellular loops) the degree of identity is 97%, with only 9 residues differing between these two receptors (see alignment in supplemental Fig. S1). These residues served as the starting point in our effort to identify the ligand-binding domain of MOR42-3 and to understand the molecular basis for the ligand preference of this receptor. We mutated each of these residues to the corresponding residues in MOR42-1. These mutations were: V82L, I112V, V113S, F114M, V202A, T205I, V206I, I208T, and A220T. MOR42-3, MOR42-1, and each of the 9 mutant MORs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes (see “Experimental Procedures”) and screened with a series of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, 8–12 carbons in length, each at 30 μm (Fig. 1; for structures, see supplemental Fig. S2). The V113S mutant displayed a ligand specificity that was intermediate between MOR42-3 and MOR42-1 (Fig. 1A). This mutant showed significantly increased responses to C10, C11, and C12 dicarboxylic acids, as compared with the responsiveness of the wild-type MOR42-3 (Fig. 1B, supplemental Table S1). The other mutants showed either no effect (e.g. V82L and I208T) or had subtle effects (e.g. the decrease in C8 responsiveness for I112V and V202A). We pursued a further examination of some of these positions with a series of double mutations (see below). At position 113, the change from valine to serine is a change in both the volume and hydrophobicity of the side chain. The decreased side chain volume of the serine at this position in MOR42-1 is permissive for ligands with longer carbon lengths. To further probe the role of this position, we tested a V113A mutant. The alanine residue has a volume similar to that of serine (89 versus 94 Å3, respectively) (35Tsai J. Taylor R. Chothia C. Gerstein M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) but preserves the hydrophobic character of valine. We found that the ligand specificity of the V113A mutant was also intermediate between MOR42-3 and MOR42-1 (supplemental Fig. S3). Our results suggest that Val-113 in MOR42-3 imposes a spatial restraint that prevents the receptor from responding to long chain dicarboxylic acids.Development of a Homology Model of MOR42-3—To understand the molecular features of MOR42-3 that may be involved in ligand binding and specificity, we generated a homology model as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1C). A series of highly conserved residues in the TM domains of MOR42-3 allowed unambiguous alignment with rhodopsin (supplemental Fig. S1). Our model retained the ellipsoidal central cavity lined by TM helices I–III and V–VII. Helix IV is not part of the cavity wall and only makes contacts with helix III, as seen in rhodopsin (36Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4991) Google Scholar). Several highly conserved motifs in GPCRs are also present in the MOR42 subfamily, including the (D/E)R(Y/W) motif located near the cytoplasmic end of TMIII and the NPXXY motif in TMVII. These motifs are thought to form a hydrogen bond network important for inter-helical interactions (37Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and may play a role in receptor transformation from an inactive form to an active, G protein-coupled conformation (38Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Conserved prolines that produce kinks in the helix structure of MOR42-3 are Pro-162 (in TMIV, equivalent to Pro-170 in rhodopsin) and Pro-303 (in TMVII, position 291 in rhodopsin). Pro-267 in the middle of the helix VI of rhodopsin also makes a significant bend of the helix structure but is not found in the members of the MOR42 subfamily. Movement of helix 6 is thought to be important for receptor activation (39Shi L. Liapakis G. Xu R. Guarnieri F. Ballesteros J.A. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40989-40996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and the absence of the proline in helix VI of MOR42-3 may indicate that the activation process differs in these MORs. The short helix VIII that runs parallel to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane is also present in our model, as are several conserved positively charged amino acids in this helix. Extracellular loop 2 (EC2) is a 24-residue loop that has 3 conserved cysteines (173, 183, 193), one of which very likely forms a disulfide bond with an equally well conserved cysteine in TMIII (at position 101 in MOR42-3). We modeled a disulfide bond between 101–173 positions, because that configuration produced the most favorable energy (see “Experimental Procedures”). This disulfide bond constrains EC2 toward the helical core and governs its topology. A disulfide bond at this position is highly conserved in rhodopsin-like GPCRs and is important in the mechanism of activation, as well as in the formation and folding of rhodopsin (40Davidson F.F. Loewen P.C. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4029-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 41Hwa J. Klein-Seetharaman J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4872-4876Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that the extracellular loops are the most imprecise features of our homology model. Much of the OR sequence is either absent from the rhodopsin crystal structure or so divergent as to preclude unambiguous alignment.Further Mutation Analysis at the Putative Ligand Binding Site—Our initial mutation screen indicated valine 113 determines the dicarboxylic acid carbon length preference. Based on proximity to Val-113 in our model, we explored the role of additional residues that differ between MOR42-3 and MOR42-1 (Fig. 1C). We tested a series of double mutants consisting of the V113S mutation and each of four other mutations (I112V, F114M, V202A, and V206I). Each double mutant was screened with the C8-C12 dicarboxylic acids as described above. The results of this screen are shown in Fig. 2. The I112V/V113S, V202A/V113S, and V206A/V113S double mutants were each significantly more responsive to the C10 and C11 dicarboxylic acids than was the V113S single mutant, indicating that the ligand specificities of these double mutants were even further shifted toward the ligand specificity of MOR42-1. The ligand specificity of the F114M/V113S double mutant did not differ from V113S. Our results demonstrate that residues Ile-112, Val-113, Val-202, and Val-206 are involved in determining the carbon length preference of MOR42-3 and are likely to form part of the ligand binding pocket in this receptor.FIGURE 2Double mutant screen of MOR42-3. A, an oocyte expressing the I112V/V113S double mutant of MOR42-3 was challenged with 30 μm dicarboxylic acids of varying carbon length. B, summary of four to seven recordings from oocytes expressing MOR42-3, MOR42-1, the V113S mutant of MOR42-3, or one of four double mutants of MOR42-3.

Significant differences from the V113S mutant: *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An additional set of mutations was chosen based on proximity to Val-113 in our receptor model (R207A and N210T in TMV, T259G in TMVI) and based on inclusion in the set of 22 predicted ligand binding residues (1Man O. Gilad Y. Lancet D. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 240-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (Y109W, N117A, H185Y). Residues at these six positions are identical in both MOR42-3 and MOR42-1. Thus, we mutated each residue to the corresponding residue in MOR42-2 (a more distantly related member of the MOR42 subfamily). If all three receptors had the same residue at a certain position, we mutated it to alanine. One exception was Y109W in TMIII. By introducing the bulkier hydrophobic tryptophan at this position, we sought to impede access of dicarboxy"

To better dissect this mechanism, we developed an activity-based assay for Dun1, a downstream DNA damage check-point kinase in yeast, using its physiological substrate Sml1. Using this assay, we confirmed the genetic basis of Dun1 activation. Rad53 was found to be directly responsible for Dun1 activation. We reconstituted the activation of Dun1 by Rad53 and found that phosphorylation of Thr-380 in the activation loop of Dun1 by Rad53 is responsible for Dun1 activation. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the evolutionarily conserved Thr-354 in the activation loop of Rad53 is also important for the regulation of Rad53 activity. Thus, this conserved mode of activation loop phosphorylation appears to be a general mechanism for the activation of Chk2 family kinases.

Thus, this conserved mode of activation loop phosphorylation appears to be a general mechanism for the activation of Chk2 family kinases. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an evolutionarily conserved kinase cascade, consisting of Mec1, Tel1, Chk1, Rad53, and Dun1, is responsible for cellular responses to DNA damage (1Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Although Mec1 and Tel1 are involved in the initial detection of DNA damage (2Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), Rad53 and Dun1 function as effector kinases to regulate many downstream cellular processes. Both Rad53 and Dun1 belong to the Chk2 family kinases, which contain a Forkhead-associated (FHA) 2The abbreviations used are: FHA, Forkhead-associated; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; MS, mass spectrometry; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; CIP, calf intestinal phosphatase; TEV, tobacco etch virus; HU, hydroxyurea; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: FHA, Forkhead-associated; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; MS, mass spectrometry; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; CIP, calf intestinal phosphatase; TEV, tobacco etch virus; HU, hydroxyurea; WT, wild type. domain and a serine/threonine kinase domain. DNA damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of Rad53 and Dun1 in response to DNA damage depends on Mec1 (3Sanchez Y. Desany B.A. Jones W.J. Liu Q. Wang B. Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 271: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adaptor proteins Rad9 and Mrc1 are important for DNA damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of Rad53 (4Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 5Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F. Carr A.M.

Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Rad9 and Mrc1 become hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA damage treatment in a Mec1- and Tel1-dependent manner (5Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K. Furuya K.

Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).After DNA damage, Rad53 binds to hyperphosphorylated Rad9 and Mrc1 via its FHA domains. It was thus proposed that this interaction might be important for the activation of Rad53 in vivo. Rad53 activation appears to be accompanied by its autophosphorylation (11Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 12Smolka M. Albuquerque S.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On the other hand, DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Dun1 was shown to depend on Rad53, and Rad53 could phosphorylate Dun1 in vitro (13Bashkirov V.I. Bashkirova E.V. Haghnazari E. Heyer W.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1441-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Lee S.J. Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6300-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, the activity of Dun1 was not measured directly. Because Dun1 acts genetically downstream of Mec1, Tel1, Rad9, Mrc1, and Rad53, understanding the regulation of Dun1 should further help to understand the activation of Rad53 and its upstream kinases Mec1 and Tel1. To this end, it is important to develop an activity-based assay for Dun1 and its upstream kinases using its physiological substrate.Dun1 was originally identified as a mutant showing defect in the up-regulation of a transcription of genes encoding ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) in response to DNA damage (15Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1119-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Dun1 is involved in various DNA damage responses, including G2 arrest after DNA damage (13Bashkirov V.I. Bashkirova E.V. Haghnazari E. Heyer W.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1441-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Gardner R. Putnam C.W. Weinert T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), in addition to the regulation of dNTP level after DNA damage. The RNR complex catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of dNTP from NTP, which is crucial for DNA replication and repair. Multiple mechanisms were identified to regulate the dNTP level via the regulation of the RNR complex in the yeast S. cerevisiae. First, transcription of the RNR genes is up-regulated in response to DNA damage, which is regulated by Dun1 (17Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Second, Sml1, an inhibitor of RNR, is degraded in response to DNA damage (18Zhao X. Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. Rothstein R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 19Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Importantly, Dun1 appears to be directly responsible for Sml1 phosphorylation and its subsequent degradation (20Zhao X. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3746-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Finally, Dun1-dependent regulation of the localization of different RNR subunits in response to DNA damage serves as additional mechanisms for the regulation of RNR activity in the cells (21Lee Y.D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Zhang Z. An X. Yang K. Perlstein D.L. Hicks L. Kelleher N. Stubbe J. Huang M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1422-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that an important function of Dun1 is the regulation of dNTP level in the cells. Several lines of evidence further suggested that Sml1 is a physiological substrate of Dun1. First, Sml1 was known to undergo Dun1-dependent degradation in response to DNA damage (20Zhao X. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3746-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Second, Dun1 was shown to phosphorylate Sml1 efficiently in vitro (20Zhao X. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3746-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Third, Dun1 interacts with Sml1 (23Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.L. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K. Boutilier K. Yang L. Wolting C. Donaldson I. Schandorff S. Shewnarane J. Vo M. Taggart J. Goudreault M. Muskat B. Alfarano C. Dewar D. Lin Z. Michalickova K.

Thus, phosphorylation of Sml1 by Dun1 may provide an assay to measure the kinase activity of Dun1.In this study, we established an in vitro assay to quantify the activity of Dun1 for Sml1 hyperphosphorylation. Using this assay, we found that the activity of Dun1 is strongly induced after DNA damage treatment. Importantly, phosphorylation of Dun1 is required for this activity. Furthermore, we confirmed and expanded the roles of Mec1, Tel1, Rad9, and Mrc1 in the activation of Dun1. Interestingly, deletion of RAD53 completely abolished the activity of Dun1 for Sml1 hyperphosphorylation. We further reconstituted Dun1 activation using Rad53 and identified the phosphorylation sites of Dun1 using quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). Analysis of the phosphorylation-defective mutants of Dun1 revealed that Thr-380 in the activation loop of the kinase domain of Dun1 is critical for Dun1 activation by Rad53 and DNA damage-induced Sml1 degradation in vivo. Furthermore, we identified that phosphorylation of the conserved Thr-354 in the activation loop of Rad53 regulates Rad53 activity. Our data thus suggested that phosphorylation of the conserved threonine residue in the activation loop of Dun1 and Rad53 is a key event to regulate their kinase activities.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Plasmids, and Genetic Methods—Standard yeast growth and genetic methods are used in this work. Strains used in this work are listed in supplemental Table S1. Plasmids used in this work are listed in supplemental Table S2. GFP-Sml1 was first cloned into the pFA6a plasmid using PacI and AscI and then introduced into yeast cells via homologous recombination (24Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). C-terminal TAF-tagged Dun1 was cloned into a pFA6a plasmid, yielding pFA6a-Dun1TAF-KanMX6 plasmid. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate various Dun1 mutants in this plasmid, which were then used to generate endogenous Dun1 mutants using homologous recombination. The TAF tag contains a His6-FLAG-protein A, with a TEV protease cleavage sequence between the FLAG sequence and protein A. This allows the elution of Dun1 using TEV protease. After TEV cleavage, a remaining FLAG sequence at the C terminus of Dun1 allows the detection of Dun1 using anti-FLAG Western blot. Deletion of Sml1 suppresses the lethality of MEC1 and RAD53 deletion, as well as synthetic lethality of RAD9 and MRC1 deletion. For Dun1 activity study, sml1Δ background was therefore used unless noted otherwise (other studies indicated that deletion of SML1 does not affect Dun1 activity in WT cells). 3S-H. Chen, M. B. Smolka, and H. Zhou, unpublished observations. All mutations or integrations introduced in yeast cells were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Sml1 was cloned into pGEX-4T1 using BamHI and EcoRI sites. Recombinant Rad53 was cloned into a pET21a plasmid with an N-terminal protein A tag using EcoRI and NotI sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate Rad53-T354A mutant. To generate Rad53-4TA, which contains a quadruple mutation including T5A, T8A, T12A, and T15A, a primer containing these mutations was used to PCR-amplify the Rad53 sequence and subclone into pET21a plasmid. WT and mutant Rad53 were cloned into a pFA6a plasmid with or without a C-terminal TAF tag, which were then used to transform into yeast cells to generate endogenous Rad53 mutants. DNA sequencing was performed to verify the sequence in each case.Protein Purification Techniques and CIP Treatment—For purification of Dun1, 50 ml of yeast culture was used. Cells were either untreated or treated by 0.05% MMS for 2 h and then harvested. Dun1-TAF in various yeast mutants was affinity-purified using IgG resin and eluted after TEV protease cleavage. For CIP treatment, Dun1-TAF bound to the IgG resin was incubated with 10 units of CIP (New England Biolabs) in 50 ml of buffer 3 at 37 °C for 1 h (New England Biolabs), washed by Tris-buffered saline, and then eluted after cleavage using 10 units of TEV protease at 30 °C for 1 h. The amount of Dun1 was quantified and normalized using quantitative anti-FLAG Western blot and silver staining. To purify recombinant Rad53, N-terminal protein A-tagged Rad53 was affinity-purified using IgG resin and eluted after TEV protease cleavage. To purify recombinant GST-Sml1, glutathione-affinity chromatography was used according to the manufacturer's recommendation.In Vitro Kinase Assay—In a typical kinase assay, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μCi of [32P]ATP were used. 2 ng of Dun1 and 2 μg of GST-Sml1 were always used unless indicated otherwise. The amount of Rad53 or Dun1 used is indicated in the figure legends. A 1-h kinase reaction at 30 °C was always used.Dun1 Phosphorylation Analysis Using Quantitative Mass Spectrometry—To identify MMS-induced phosphorylation of endogenous Dun1, ∼8 g of Dun1-TAF cell pellets was used to purify ∼2 μg of Dun1. Similar amounts of Dun1 purified from rad53Δ cells were used for MS analysis of the phosphorylation of Dun1 with or without in vitro Rad53 phosphorylation. For quantitative comparison of Dun1 phosphorylation, the same amount of Dun1 to be compared was digested by trypsin, labeled by an N-isotag reagent as described previously (12Smolka M. Albuquerque S.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here we used d0 (no deuterium) or d10 (10 deuterium) containing t-butoxycarbonyl-Leu-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester instead of the t-butoxycarbonyl-γ-aminobutyric acid-N-hydroxysuccinimide esters used previously (12Smolka M.

With or without N-isotag labeling, phosphopeptides of Dun1 were purified using immobilized metal affinity column and analyzed as described previously (12Smolka M. Albuquerque S.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Data base search was performed with no restriction on the enzyme used for proteolysis, and the entire yeast data base was used. Only doubly tryptic phosphopeptides were considered and manually verified.RESULTSActivity of Dun1 Is Induced by DNA Damage Treatment and Depends on Its Phosphorylation—To dissect the regulation of Dun1, we sought to develop an activity assay for Dun1, using its physiological substrate Sml1. To ask whether DNA damage treatment could activate Dun1, we compared the phosphorylation of Sml1 by Dun1-TAF that is epitope-tagged and integrated into the DUN1 chromosomal locus, purified from either untreated or MMS-treated cells (we chose to analyze Dun1-TAF, because previous data indicated that Dun1 overexpressed from either yeast or bacteria has a drastically reduced activity for Sml1 hyperphosphorylation). 3S-H. Chen, M. B. Smolka, and H. Zhou, unpublished observations. As shown in Fig. 1A, MMS treatment strongly enhanced the activity of Dun1 for Sml1 hyperphosphorylation. Importantly, prior treatment of the purified Dun1, using CIP, abolished the activity of Dun1 entirely. Therefore, phosphorylation of Dun1 is essential for its ability to hyperphosphorylate Sml1 (kinase-dead mutant of Dun1, purified using the same method, cannot hyperphosphorylate Sml1; see Fig. 4C). An important feature of Sml1 hyperphosphorylation by Dun1 is a characteristic slower gel shift of the hyperphosphorylated Sml1 compared with unphosphorylated Sml1 (see Fig. 1A, top panel). The 32P incorporation of Sml1 is attributed to this hyperphosphorylated Sml1 (see Fig. 1A, middle panel).FIGURE 4A, Western blot analysis of the abundance of WT Dun1 and various Dun1 phosphorylation-site mutants with the control of Ponceau S staining of the same. B, UV and hydroxyurea sensitivities of various Dun1 phosphorylation-defective mutants. A serial dilution of various cells was spotted on either HU-containing YPD plate or YPD plate and subjected to UV treatment. C, comparison of the activity of WT, Dun1-KD, and Dun1-T380A for Sml1 hyperphosphorylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the efficiency of Sml1 hyperphosphorylation by Dun1, we examined the dependence of Sml1 hyperphosphorylation on varying concentrations of active Dun1 purified from MMS-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, increasing amounts of Dun1 led to more Sml1 hyperphosphorylation and its slower gel shift. Quantification of hyperphosphorylated Sml1 revealed that there is an approximately linear relationship between the amount of hyperphosphorylated Sml1 and the concentration of Dun1 when the Dun1 concentration is less than 1.6 nm (see Fig. 1C). This is expected because unphosphorylated Sml1 is in great excess compared with Dun1. At higher Dun1 concentrations, phosphorylation of Sml1 appeared to reach saturation, and most of Sml1 was converted into a hyperphosphorylated form (see Fig. 1B). Therefore, for accurate comparison of Dun1 activity, the amount of Dun1 used here is always in the linear range where approximately half of Sml1 remains unphosphorylated.Genetic Analysis of Dun1 Activation Reveals the Roles of Various DNA Damage Checkpoint Genes—Mec1 and Tel1 are known to function at the top of the kinase cascade in the DNA damage checkpoint. We therefore asked how Dun1 activity might depend on Mec1 and Tel1. As shown in Fig. 2A, deletion of MEC1 greatly diminished the activity of Dun1 in either untreated or MMS-treated cells, compared with WT cells. On the other hand, deletion of TEL1 diminished the activity of Dun1 in the absence of MMS treatment. After MMS treatment, Dun1 was activated in tel1Δ cells, similar to that in WT cells. Interestingly, deletion of both MEC1 and TEL1 completely abolished the activity of Dun1 (also see Fig. 2D). The 32P incorporation in the phosphorylated Sml1, excised from the gel, was quantified using scintillation counting, which confirmed the relative contributions of Mec1 and Tel1 in Dun1 activation.FIGURE 2Analysis of Dun1 activity purified from various mutant backgrounds. A, upper panel, Coomassie staining of Sml1. Middle panel, autoradiography of Sml1. Bottom panel, anti-FLAG Western blot shows the loading control of Dun1 used.

D, closer examination of Dun1 activity in various checkpoint mutants, using 5-fold more (10 ng) of Dun1 purified from each mutant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rad9 and Mrc1 are adaptor proteins in the DNA damage and replication checkpoints. We next asked whether they could play a role in Dun1 activation using the same Sml1 phosphorylation assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, deletion of RAD9 reduced the activity of Dun1 in both untreated and MMS-treated cells, compared with that in WT cells. Interestingly, deletion of MRC1 alone led to a much higher activity of Dun1 than that of Dun1 in WT cells in the absence of MMS treatment. MMS treatment of the mrc1Δ cells resulted in a higher activity of Dun1, which is similar to that of WT cells after MMS treatment. Furthermore, deletion of both RAD9 and MRC1 greatly diminished the activity of Dun1, although a residual activity of Dun1 in rad9Δ mrc1Δ cells does exist (Fig. 2D). Therefore, Rad9 and Mrc1 act redundantly for Dun1 activation in vivo. Although Rad9 appears to only promote Dun1 activation in response to DNA damage, Mrc1 has a dual role. First, Mrc1 prevents Dun1 activation in the absence of exogenous DNA damage treatment. Second, Mrc1 acts redundantly with Rad9 to facilitate DNA damage-induced Dun1 activation. Together, Rad9 and Mrc1 are critical for the activation of Dun1.Rad53 and Chk1 are thought to be effector kinases in the DNA damage checkpoint. Rad53, in particular, was shown to interact with Dun1 and to be able to phosphorylate Dun1 in vitro (13Bashkirov V.I. Bashkirova E.V. Haghnazari E. Heyer W.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1441-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Lee S.J. Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6300-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We thus examined the roles of Rad53 and Chk1 in the activation of Dun1. The activities of Dun1 in rad53Δ, chk1Δ, and rad53Δ chk1Δ mutants were quantified. Deletion of RAD53 completely abolished the activity of Dun1 in both untreated and MMS-treated cells, whereas deletion of CHK1 alone had no detectable effect (see Fig. 2C). Therefore, Rad53 is required for Dun1 activation in vivo. To better examine the residual activity of Dun1 in rad53Δ, mec1Δ, mec1Δ tel1Δ, and rad9Δ mrc1Δ cells, 5-fold more Dun1 (10 ng), compared with the amount used in Fig. 2, A–C, was used to phosphorylate Sml1. As shown in Fig. 2D, Dun1 purified from rad53Δ cells is completely defective in Sml1 hyperphosphorylation, although a hypophosphorylated Sml1 was detected. Similarly Dun1 purified from mec1Δ tel1Δ cells is completely defective in Sml1 hyperphosphorylation. Interestingly, Dun1 has a weak but readily detectable activity for Sml1 hyperphosphorylation in mec1Δ cells, which is induced by MMS treatment. This activity is presumably dependent on Tel1 because deletion of both MEC1 and TEL1 abolished the activity of Dun1 completely (see Fig. 2D). Finally, Dun1 in rad9Δ mrc1Δ cells could still hyperphosphorylate Sml1. This observation suggested that Mec1 and Tel1 could bypass the requirement of Rad9 and Mrc1 to activate Rad53 and Dun1; however, this activation is far less than that in WT cells.In Vitro Activation of Dun1 by Rad53 for Sml1 Hyperphosphorylation—Because Rad53 is required for Dun1 activation in vivo, we next asked whether recombinant Rad53 could activate Dun1 for Sml1 hyperphosphorylation in vitro (recombinant Rad53 alone does not hyperphosphorylate Sml1).3 As shown in Fig. 3A, WT Rad53 shows a reduced electrophoretic mobility compared with Rad53-KD, which is due to its autophosphorylation. Rad53-4TA has a similar electrophoretic mobility as WT Rad53. As shown in Fig. 3B, recombinant WT Rad53 activated WT Dun1, purified from rad53Δ cells, for Sml1 hyperphosphorylation, whereas Dun1-D328A or Dun1-KD, failed to be activated by WT Rad53 (Fig. 3B). Thus, the kinase activity of Dun1 is required for Sm1 hyperphosphorylation. Next we asked whether a known interaction between the N-terminal 4TQ phosphorylation cluster of Rad53 and FHA domain of Dun1 is important for Rad53 to activate Dun1 (14Lee S.J. Schwartz M.F. Duong J.K. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6300-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, the same amount of recombinant Rad53-4TA mutant kinase failed to activate WT Dun1 for Sml1 hyperphosphorylation. Conversely, Dun1-R60A, N103A, in which the binding capacity of Dun1 FHA domain is compromised by the R60A and N103A mutations, failed to be activated by WT Rad53 as expected. Therefore, the interaction between the N-terminal 4TQ phosphorylation cluster of Rad53 and Dun1 FHA domain is important for the activation of Dun1 by Rad53.FIGURE 3A, Coomassie staining of purified recombinant Rad53, including wild type, 4TA mutant, and kinase-dead mutant. B, in vitro activation of Dun1 using Rad53. 1 ng of WT or 4TA mutant Rad53 was used. C, phosphorylation maps of Dun1 revealed that Rad53 is entirely responsible for Dun1 phosphorylation. D, summary of autophosphorylation sites of Dun1 and the Rad53-induced transphosphorylation sites of Dun1 identified using quantitative MS.

Albuquerque S.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). More than 20 phosphorylation sites were detected in four regions of Dun1, including the N-terminal region, the region between the FHA and kinase domains, the activation loop of the kinase domain, and the C-terminal region (see Fig. 3C). Next, we identified the phosphorylation sites of Dun1 (purified from rad53Δ cells) before and after Rad53 phosphorylation in vitro. Little phosphorylation of Dun1 was detected in rad53Δ cells. After in vitro phosphorylation by Rad53, the phosphorylation sites of Dun1 were again identified. Interestingly, the DNA damage-induced phosphorylation sites of endogenous Dun1 and the in vitro phosphorylation sites of Dun1 by Rad53 are essentially the same. Therefore, Rad53 is directly responsible for Dun1 phosphorylation.To identify possible autophosphorylation sites of Dun1, we used the N-isotag technology to quantitatively compare the relative abundance between WT Dun1 and Dun1-KD, i.e. Dun1-D328A, after MMS treatment (12Smolka M. Albuquerque S.P. Chen S.H. Schmidt K.H. Wei X.X. Kolodner R.D. Zhou H. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1358-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3D, the abundance of two phosphopeptides containing Ser-10 and Ser-139, respectively, is greatly reduced in Dun1-KD, compared with WT Dun1, whereas the abundance of other Dun1 phosphopeptides are essentially unchanged between WT Dun1 and Dun1-KD. Therefore, Ser-10 and Ser-139 are autophosphorylation sites of Dun1 (see Fig. 3D). Next we used quantitative MS to quantify the abundance changes in phosphorylation of Dun1-KD (purified from unperturbed cells), following its in vitro phosphorylation by Rad53. The Ser/Thr residues of Dun1 that were strongly phosphorylated by Rad53 were determined (see Fig. 3D), whereas the others were much less phosphorylated and thus not shown. Interestingly, these highly phosphorylated sites of Dun1 by Rad53 all have a bulky and hydrophobic residue at the +1 position relative to the phosphorylated Ser/Thr residue (see Fig. 3D).Phosphorylation of Thr-380 of Dun1 Is Critical for Its Kinase Activity—As shown above, several phosphorylation sites of Dun1 were found, including autophosphorylation sites Ser-10 and Ser-139, and a number of transphosphorylation sites, including Thr-380, Ser-195, and others. To ask whether these phosphorylation sites of Dun1 might be important for its function, we next examined the sensitivities of various Dun1 phosphorylation-defective mutants, including dun1-S10A, dun1-S139A, dun1-S195A, and dun1-T380A, to DNA replication stress caused by hydroxyurea or UV treatment. First we confirmed that various Dun1 phosphorylation site mutants have similar abundance in cells (see Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, mutations to Ser-10 and Ser-139 of Dun1 rendered the cells more sensitive to HU and UV treatments. Therefore, autophosphorylation of Dun1 is functionally important. On the other hand, S195A mutation has little effect. Previous observations3 indicated that mutations to other SF/TF sites of Dun1 did not inactivate Dun1 and thus were not investigated further. Interestingly, dun1-T380A is very sensitive to both HU and UV treatments. We then examined the activity of Dun1-T380A and compared it with those of WT Dun1 and a kinase-inactive allele of Dun1, i.e. Dun1-KD or Dun1-D328A. As shown in Fig. 4C, whereas WT Dun1 showed MMS-induced activation, Dun1-KD is completely inactive as expected. Interestingly, Dun1-T380A is also completely defective in Sml1 hyperphosphorylation. Dun1-T380A did phosphorylate Sml1 into a hypopho"

The extent to which SphK signaling mediates the pleiotropic effects of TNF-α is not entirely clear. The current study examined the role of SphK activity in TNF-α-stimulated cell proliferation in 1321N1 glioblastoma cells. We first demonstrated that pharmacological inhibitors of SphK markedly decrease TNF-α-stimulated DNA synthesis. Signaling mechanisms through which SphK mediated the effect of TNF-α on DNA synthesis were then examined. Inhibition of Rho proteins with C3 exoenzyme or of Rho kinase with Y27632 attenuated TNF-α-stimulated DNA synthesis. However, RhoA activation by TNF-α was not blocked by SphK inhibition. ERK activation was also required for TNF-α-stimulated DNA synthesis but likewise TNF-α-induced ERK activation was not blocked by inhibition of SphK. Thus, neither RhoA nor ERK activation are the SphK-dependent transducers of TNF-α-induced proliferation. In contrast, TNF-α-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, which was also required for DNA synthesis, was attenuated by SphK inhibition or SphK1 knockdown by small interfering RNA. Furthermore, cyclin D expression was increased by TNF-α in a SphK- and Akt-dependent manner. Additional studies demonstrated that TNF-α effects on DNA synthesis, ERK, and Akt phosphorylation are not mediated through cell surface Gi -coupled S1P receptors, because none of these responses were inhibited by pertussis toxin. We conclude that SphK-dependent Akt activation plays a significant role in TNF-α-induced cyclin D expression and cell proliferation."

We found that Ala substitution at residues that contact the phosphate 5′ to the lesion (H270A mutation) and its Watson-Crick face (Q315A mutation) simply removed key functionality from the contact interface but otherwise had no effect on structure. Ala substitution at the only residue making an oxoG-specific contact (G42A mutation) introduced torsional stress into the DNA contact surface of hOGG1, but this was overcome by local interactions within the folded protein, indicating that this oxoG recognition motif is “hardwired.” Introduction of a side chain intended to sterically obstruct the active site pocket (Q315F mutation) led to two different structures, one of which (Q315F*149) has the oxoG lesion in an exosite flanking the active site and the other of which (Q315F*292) has the oxoG inserted nearly completely into the lesion recognition pocket.

The internal components of aerobic cells are under chronic bombardment by electrophilic agents known collectively as reactive oxygen species (1Grollman A.P. Moriya M. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 246-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). These ferocious oxidants typically arise endogenously as by-products of aerobic respiration but can also be produced via exposure to external sources such as ionizing radiation and exogenous carcinogens (2Lindahl T.

Attack of reactive oxygen species on the genome is particularly deleterious because the resulting strand breaks and nucleobase lesions seriously compromise the informational integrity of DNA. The most troublesome site of reactive oxygen species attack on the genome is the C8 position of G because oxidation at this position gives rise to a genotoxic product, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (oxoG) 4The abbreviations used are: oxoG, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine; Ogg1, 8-ox-oguanine glycosylase; hOGG1, human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase; LRC, lesion recognition complex; DXL, disulfide cross-linking; Kd, equilibrium binding constant; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.

DNA glycosylases belonging to each of the four known structural superfamilies of DNA glycosylases, two of which are represented by MutM and Ogg1, contain in their active site pocket conserved residues that serve critical roles in catalysis plus variable residues that are responsible for conferring the unique lesion recognition preferences of individual enzymes. Elucidating the roles that each of these residues serves in lesion recognition, discrimination, and excision is a key goal in the structural biology of base excision DNA repair. Human Ogg1 (hOGG1), like all other members of the HhH-GPD (helix-hairpin-helix glycine/proline-rich loop terminated by an aspartic acid) superfamily (24Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P.

Chung S.J. Verdine G.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The catalytic nucleophile, Lys-249, is essential both to initiate excision of oxoG and to catalyze a subsequent cascade of reactions leading to strand scission by conjugate elimination on the 3′-side of the lesion (lyase cascade). Mutation of Asp-268 and Lys-249 to Asn and Gln, respectively, generate variant forms (D268N and K249Q) that lack base excision activity but retain the ability to bind oxoG-containing DNA tightly and specifically (26Norman D.P. Chung S.J. Verdine G.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Nash H.M. Lu R. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); x-ray crystal structures of lesion recognition complexes (LRCs) comprising K249Q and D268N hOGG1 bound to oxoG-containing DNA have yielded valuable insights into the particular features of oxoG recognition and discrimination in this system (22Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 26Norman D.P. Chung S.J. Verdine G.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Of particular interest in this regard are residues that hydrogen bond directly to the oxoG nucleobase, Gly-42 and Gln-315, and His-270, which hydrogen bonds to the 5′-phosphate of the oxoG lesion (Fig. 1A). Crystallographic evidence indicates that the His-270/5′-phosphate contact is formed late in the process of extruding the target nucleobase from DNA (28Banerjee A. Yang W. Karplus M. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2005; 434: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) (see also below). Ala point substitutions at Gln-315 and His-270 have a deleterious effect on binding and hence catalysis (29van der Kemp P.A. Charbonnier J.B. Audebert M. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), whereas Gly-42 has not been subjected to mutagenic analysis. Here we report the characterization of variant forms of hOGG1 having point mutations at Gly-42, His-270, and Gln-315. These studies support the notion that the reported H270A mutation merely diminishes binding by removing functionality that stabilizes the lesion recognition complex. This work also revealed that the positioning of Gly-42 to contact N7-H of oxoG was retained despite the mutational introduction of steric repulsion, indicating that the Gly-42 amide carbonyl is “hard-wired” to provide maximal discrimination of oxoG from its normal relative, G. Finally we report the identification of a point substitution at Gln-315 that slightly mispositioned oxoG in the active site but completely ablated catalysis of base excision, suggesting that the transition state for this Sn1-like displacement is geometrically demanding. Cloning and Protein Preparation—The fragment of hOGG1 used for crystallographic characterization (22Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) was overproduced in bacteria from a vector encoding residues 12-327 of the human Ogg1 cDNA cloned into the pET30a vector (Novagen) using the restriction sites EcoRI and HindIII. Fragments used for electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays were overproduced in Escherichia coli by cloning a PCR fragment of hOGG1 containing residues 12-345 into the pET30a vector using the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. Mutagenesis was performed via the megaprimer method (30Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). All new constructs were sequenced throughout the hOGG1-coding sequence. All proteins were overexpressed and purified by the published method (26Norman D.P. Chung S.J. Verdine G.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). DNA Preparation, Disulfide Cross-linking, and Crystallization—Oligomers used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays, 5′-GGATAGTGTCCAXGTTACTCGAAGC-3′, where the X indicates either G or oxoG, and its complement 5′-GCTTCGAGTAACCTGGACACTATCC-3′, were synthesized on an ABI Expedite 8909 DNA synthesizer using standard methods and purified by 15% urea-PAGE. For crystallization, DNA oligomers 5′-AGCGTCCA(oxoG)GTCTACC-3′, 5′-AGCGTCCAGGTCTACC-3′, and 5′-TGGTAGACCTGGACGC-3′ were also synthesized on an ABI Expedite 8909 DNA synthesizer using standard reagents. The DNA oligomers 5′-TGGTAGACCTGGACGC-3′ (proximal cross-link to Cys-149) and 5′-TGGTAGACCTGGACGC-3′ (distal cross-link to Cys-292), where the underlined position denotes the site of modification with the thiol-bearing tether, were synthesized and functionalized with a two-carbon linker and a four-carbon linker, respectively, as described previously (31MacMillan A.M. Verdine G.L. Tetrahedron. 1991; 47: 2603-2616Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 32Wolfe S.A. Ferentz A.E. Grantcharova V. Churchill M.E. Verdine G.L. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 213-221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Phosphoramidite derivatives of oxoG, O4-triazolyl-dU, and O6-phenyl-dI were purchased from Glen Research. DNA was purified by 20% urea-PAGE and dissolved in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Non-cross-linked and cross-linked protein-DNA complexes were formed and crystallized as described previously (22Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 28Banerjee A. Yang W. Karplus M. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2005; 434: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Briefly the cross-linked complexes were formed by mixing duplex DNA with 2-fold molar excess protein and incubating at 4 °C for several days. The cross-linked complexes were purified away from the unreacted DNA and protein by Mono Q chromatography (GE Healthcare), buffer-exchanged and concentrated to 280 μm, and crystallized by the hanging droplet vapor diffusion method at 4 °C. Crystals appeared within a few days in well solution containing 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0 or 6.5, 50-200 mm CaCl2, and 12-15% polyethylene glycol 8000. Crystals were allowed to grow for several days, transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing mother liquor supplemented with 25% glycerol, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Data Collection and Refinement—X-ray data were collected at 100 K at the X25 beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source and 19-ID beamline of the Advanced Photon Source. All diffraction data were processed using HKL2000 (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). Data collection statistics are summarized in the supplemental table. Cocrystal and cross-linked structures were determined by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the protein from the structure of the K249Q hOGG1 and cross-linked recognition complex, respectively, as the initial search model during refinement using Crystallography & NMR System (CNS) (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Residues involved in catalysis and DNA interaction were omitted from the initial search model. A partial model was generated by rigid body fit, energy minimization, and simulated annealing. Electron density for the omitted residues was clearly observed in a σA-weighted (35Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 104-149Crossref Scopus (2036) Google Scholar) Fo - Fc map. Iterative rounds of energy minimization, simulated annealing, and grouped B-factor refinement in CNS were performed while Rfree was monitored (36Brunger A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 24-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent rounds of energy minimization, simulated annealing, and individual B-factor refinement were performed. Simulated annealing omits maps were used to reduce model bias. Manual adjustments to the model were made using Quan-ta2000 (Accelrys). Water molecules were added to the model using automated (CNS) and manual inspection of the difference maps. Density for some amino acid side chains was occasionally incomplete, and in these cases, only the ordered portion of the side chain was built in to the model. Renderings of the structures were generated using PyMOL (37DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—A 25-mer oligonucleotide containing a single centrally located oxoG residue was radioactively labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then annealed to a complementary strand with C opposite oxoG. A normal duplex, whose labeled strand contained a G instead of oxoG, was prepared in an identical manner. The duplex was then incubated with serial dilutions of protein (residues 12-345) in binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol. In the case of wild-type and G42A hOGG1, the protein contained the K249Q mutation to prevent base excision from taking place. The protein-DNA mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded on a prerun 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer and electrophoresed for several hours at room temperature. Bands were quantified using ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare) and plotted in Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) to determine Kd values. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter in buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 100 mm KCl in a 0.1-cm cell at 13 °C. The temperature of the sample cell was regulated by a Jasco PTC-348 Peltier temperature control. Thermal denaturation experiments were performed by raising the cell temperature from 13 to 70 °C at 1 °C/min and monitoring the CD signal at 222 nm. Melting points were determined by taking the maximum of the first derivative plot. Cross-link Time Course Assay—Proteins were mixed in a 2:1 ratio at 4 °C with 10 μm DNA containing oxoG on one strand and equipped for proximal cross-linking (C2 tether) on the opposite strand in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Aliquots were removed at various time points and quenched by addition of methyl methanethio-sulfonate to 5 mm. The samples were analyzed on 4-12% SDS-PAGE gels in 1× MOPS buffer. Gels were stained with Coo-massie Blue, and band intensities were quantified with ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare), then plotted in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics), and fit to exponential curves. H270A—In all structures of hOGG1 LRCs, His-270 is hydrogen-bonded to the phosphate on the 5′-oxygen of oxoG; this interaction is reinforced by further hydrogen bonding of His-270 to Asp-322 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1A). On the other hand, in the structure of hOGG1 bound to DNA containing an abasic site analog (tetrahydrofuranyl; supplemental Fig. 1B), the His-270 side-chain imidazolium group is disengaged from the 5′-phosphate and instead is engaged in an aryl/aryl interaction with Phe-319 while maintaining contact with Asp-322 (38Norman D.P.G. Bruner S.D. Verdine G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 359-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); this interaction appears to be mutually exclusive with oxoG insertion into the lesion recognition pocket as the two His-270 orientations require different side-chain rotamers of Phe-319 (compare supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). The His-270/Phe-319 interaction is also observed in the structure of hOGG1 not bound to DNA (unliganded) (39Bjoras M. Seeberg E. Luna L. Pearl L.H. Barrett T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). His-270 is likewise diverted from the 5′-phosphate through interaction with Phe-319 in the structure of hOGG1 bound to DNA containing an extrahelical G residue bound to an exosite flanking, but outside, the active site pocket (28Banerjee A. Yang W. Karplus M. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2005; 434: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Together these data have led to the suggestion (28Banerjee A. Yang W. Karplus M. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2005; 434: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) that the disruption of the His-270/Phe-319 interaction and the subsequent establishment of Phe-319/oxoG and His-270/5′-phosphate contacts are a late event in the process of base extrusion and insertion into the active site pocket. We were thus interested in probing the structural effects of removing the His-270 side-chain imidazolium group (by mutation to Ala) on substrate recognition by hOGG1. It has been shown previously that the H270A mutation substantially decreases the binding affinity of hOGG1 for oxoG-containing DNA and slows glycosylase activity 160-fold under conditions of substrate saturation (29van der Kemp P.A. Charbonnier J.B. Audebert M. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the introduction of the H270A mutation diminishes the affinity of hOGG1 for tetrahydrofuranyl-containing DNA by less than 2-fold, consistent with the structural findings that His-270 does not contact DNA in this complex. To overcome the low affinity of H270A hOGG1 for DNA, we used the intermolecular disulfide cross-linking (DXL) strategy shown previously to stabilize otherwise unstable hOGG1-DNA complexes (28Banerjee A. Yang W. Karplus M. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2005; 434: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), thereby enabling detailed structural characterization. In one implementation of this strategy (Fig. 1B, proximal cross-linking), a Cys residue engineered into hOGG1 by point mutation of Asn-149 engages in disulfide bond formation with a thiol-bearing tether introduced at the N4 position of the cytosine opposite oxoG. The protein constructs used through-out this work, unless otherwise noted, contained an additional mutation (K249Q) known to abrogate catalysis while preserving specific oxoG recognition. We first examined the effect of mutating His-270 to Ala on the rate of DXL. Under conditions in which both hOGG1 and the oxoG-containing DNA duplex were present well above Kd, Ala substitution at position 270 was found to slow the rate of DXL by ∼5-fold (supplemental Fig. 2). Because cross-linking in this system is dependent upon extrusion of the target oxoG from DNA, the modest effect of the mutation on DXL suggests that His-270 does not play a significant role in promoting base extrusion. H270A/K249Q/N149C hOGG1 (hereafter designated H270A′ hOGG1), disulfide-cross-linked to the same oxoG-containing duplex as was used to solve the hOGG1 LRC structure (22Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2000; 403: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar), readily yielded crystals isomorphous to those of the corresponding LRC disulfide-cross-linked through Cys-149 (LRC*149) (asterisk denotes cross-linking to the Cys at the indicated position). Using phases from the LRC*149 as initial phases for H270A′ followed by rounds of refinement, we solved the structure of the cross-linked H270A′ complex to 2.10 Å (supplemental table). In this structure (Fig. 2, A and B), the oxoG nucleobase is fully inserted in the lesion recognition pocket just as in the LRC*149 structure. Indeed the Cα atoms in the H270A′ structure superimpose on those of the LRC*149 with a root mean square deviation of 0.15 Å (Fig. 2B), indicative of close similarity between the two; the DNA conformation is also essentially identical (not shown). Furthermore there is excellent correspondence between the positions of side chains in the active site region with the exception of Asp-322 (Fig. 2B). In LRC*149, Asp-322 hydrogen bonds to His-270; when His-270 is mutated to Ala, the side chain of Asp-322 retracts slightly from the active site and participates in a network of hydrogen bonding interactions with a cluster of four ordered water molecules that are also in contact with Asp-268 and the 5′-phosphate and 5′-oxygen of oxoG (Fig. 2B). Notwithstanding this one accommodation in the structure, the marked overall similarity between the H270A′ and LRC*149 complex structures indicate that the deficiency in binding to, and base excision of, oxoG-containing DNA results from removal of an important phosphate contact between His-270 and the 5′-phosphate and not from some structural reorganization of the protein or protein-DNA complex. A binding deficit of at least 22.5-fold observed in gel shift assays corresponds to an energetic contribution of at least 1.9 kcal/mol for this contact. G42A—Gly-42 is positioned at the base of a loop that sits directly above the active site pocket, which positions the Gly-42 main-chain carbonyl to accept a hydrogen bond from N7-H of 8-oxoG (Fig. 1A). Gly-42 is the only residue in hOGG1 that directly reads out the structural difference between G and oxoG, both through its hydrogen bonding to N7-H and through a dipole/dipole interaction between the Gly-42 C-terminal amide and the oxoG C8=O/N7-H ureide system (28Banerjee A. Yang W. Karplus M. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2005; 434: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). With G, the Gly-42 carbonyl would suffer a repulsive interaction with the lone pair of electrons on N7 of G, and the dipole/dipole interaction would likewise be repulsive rather than attractive. In all DNA-bound structures of hOGG1 solved to date and most importantly in the structure of the unliganded protein, Gly-42 and the amino acids flanking it adopt nearly identical conformations even though other residues in the active site undergo substantial ligand-dependent structural changes (supplemental Fig. 3). The values of the backbone torsion angles at Gly-42 lie outside the permissible region for any amino acid residue other than Gly (supplemental Fig. 4), suggesting that Gly may be uniquely capable of mediating the interaction with oxoG at position 42. To test this notion, we mutated Gly-42 to Ala. Replacement of a hydrogen atom at Cα (Gly) with the much larger methyl group (Ala) would introduce a substantial steric clash with the carbonyl of residue 42, and this repulsive interaction would have to be alleviated through some sort of back-bone conformational reorganization; it was unclear, however, whether these structural accommodations would compromise the stability of hOGG1 or its hydrogen bonding interaction with oxoG. The wild-type and G42A forms of hOGG1 forms gave identical CD spectra at room temperature, signifying that both were folded (data not shown). We then used CD to determine the thermal denaturation temperatures of wild-type ver- sus G42A hOGG1 and found that the mutation diminished the thermal stability of hOGG1 by the relatively modest amount of 4.6 °C (wild-type hOGG1 melts at 42.4 °C; supplemental Fig. 5). Next we measured the affinity of G42A hOGG1 for oxoG-containing DNA using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. For the G42A/K249Q mutant form of hOGG1, we determined an equilibrium binding constant (Kd) of 15 ± 2nm, whereas that for the K249Q hOGG1 (wild type at position 42) was 16 ± 3nm under the same conditions (data not shown). Taken together, these biochemical results demonstrate that the introduction of a local steric clash at position 42 diminishes the thermal stability of hOGG1 but has no effect on the affinity of its interaction with lesion-containing DNA. To elucidate the structural impact of the G42A mutation in hOGG1, we determined the structure of the corresponding DNA complex by x-ray crystallography. G42A/K249Q hOGG1 was co-crystallized with the oxoG-containing duplex, and the structure was refined to 2.2 Å (supplemental table); in this case, disulfide cross-linking was not necessary to obtain crystals. The co-crystal structure revealed the Ala mutant complex to be nearly identical with its wild-ty"

Here we have investigated the function of the 31-amino acid PetL subunit encoded in the chloroplast genome in all higher plants. Chloroplast-transformed petL knock-out tobacco plants display no obvious phenotype, suggesting that PetL is not essential for cytochrome b6 f complex biogenesis and function (Fiebig, A., Stegemann, S., and Bock, R.

We show here that, whereas young mutant leaves accumulate comparable amounts of cytochrome b6 f complex and have an identical assimilation capacity as wild type leaves, both cytochrome b6 f complex contents and assimilation capacities of mature and old leaves are strongly reduced in the mutant, indicating that the cytochrome b6 f complex is less stable than in the wild type. Reduced complex stability was also confirmed by in vitro treatments of isolated thylakoids with chaotropic reagents. Adaptive responses observed in the knockout mutants, such as delayed down-regulation of plastocyanin contents, indicate that plants can sense the restricted electron flux to photosystem I yet cannot compensate the reduced stability of the cytochrome b6 f complex by adaptive up-regulation of complex synthesis. We propose that efficient cytochrome b6 f complex biogenesis occurs only in young leaves and that the capacity for de novo synthesis of the complex is very low in mature and aging leaves.

Cyt-bf functions as a dimer with a molecular mass of 220 kDa and consists of nine subunits per monomer (1Whitelegge J.P. Zhang H. Aguilera R. Taylor R.M. Cramer W.A. Mol. Cell.

It catalyzes the rate-limiting step of linear electron transport, oxidizing PQ generated by PSII and reducing PC. PC then diffuses through the thylakoid lumen toward PSI and reduces the photooxidized chlorophyll a dimer in the PSI reaction center, P700. The PQ-PC oxidoreductase activity of the Cyt-bf is coupled to the translocation of at least two protons per transported electron into the thylakoid lumen, thus contributing to the proton motif force required for ATP synthesis (2Sacksteder C.A.

The Cyt-bf is the predominant point of flux control of linear electron transport (3Anderson J.M. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 34: 341-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 4Anderson J.M.

In addition to its function in linear electron transport and flux control, Cyt-bf has been suggested to oxidize stromal reductants in cyclic electron flux (15Zhang H. Whitelegge J.P. Cramer W.A. J.

It may also function as a redox sensor by activating thylakoid kinases and starting signal transduction chains that ultimately modify the antenna distribution between photosystems (“state transitions”) and alter photosynthetic gene expression (3Anderson J.M.

Although Cyt-bf structure has been elucidated both in the photosynthetic prokaryote Mastigocladus laminosus (21Kurisu G. Zhang H. Smith J.L. Cramer W.C. Science. 2003; 302: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and in a eukaryotic alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (16Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.L. Picot D. Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), the structural basis of its multiple functions is not fully understood. The genetic manipulation of Cyt-bf composition is complicated by six of the nine subunits of the complex being plastid genome-encoded. The only subunits encoded in the nucleus are the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (encoded by the petC gene), the small peripheral PetM subunit, and the ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase encoded by the petH gene. Ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase has been suggested to function as NADPH oxidase in cyclic electron transport (1Whitelegge J.P. Zhang H. Aguilera R. Taylor R.M. Cramer W.A. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 816-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15Zhang H. Whitelegge J.P. Cramer W.A. J. Biol.

It is located at the stromal periphery of the complex and not required for Cyt-bf function in linear electron flow, which instead is mediated by four high molecular mass subunits that bind all redox-active cofactors of the complex: PetA (Cyt-f), PetB (Cyt-b), PetC, and PetD (subunit IV). Each of these subunits is essential for the assembly and stability of Cyt-bf (8Monde R.A. Zito F. Olive J. Wollman F.A. Stern D.B. Plant J. 2000; 21: 61-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kuras R.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition to the high molecular mass subunits, the complex contains four small subunits. These are located at the periphery of Cyt-bf, and each spans the thylakoid membrane once in an α-helical conformation. Crystal structure analysis has not revealed unequivocal indications for their function (16Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.L. Picot D. Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 21Kurisu G. Zhang H. Smith J.L. Cramer W.C. Science. 2003; 302: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Based on their peripheral location, they have been hypothesized to mediate interactions with other components of the photosynthetic apparatus, such as PSI or the thylakoid kinases, which are redox-regulated by Cyt-bf (16Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.L. Picot D. Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have revealed that some of the small subunits are essential for stability and assembly of the complex (24Cramer W.A. Yan J. Zhang H. Kurisu G. Smith J.L. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 85: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Knock-out of the plastome-encoded PetN subunit in tobacco (25Hager M. Biehler K. Illerhaus J. Ruf S. Bock R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) has resulted in total loss of Cyt-bf. The same was observed after deletion of the PetG subunit in C. reinhardtii (26Berthold D.A. Schmidt C.L. Malkin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29293-29298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The function of the nuclear-encoded PetM subunit in photosynthetic eukaryotes is still enigmatic, as no knock-out mutant has been obtained yet. Knock-out of petM in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis did not result in any alteration of the redox properties of Cyt-bf, but the accumulation of other complexes of the photosynthetic electron transport chain was found to be altered, suggesting that PetM might be involved in the postulated signal transduction function of the Cyt-bf (27Schneider D. Berry S. Rich P. Seidler A. Rogner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16780-16785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Currently, the only Cyt-bf subunit directly demonstrated to be nonessential for Cyt-bf function in higher plants is PetL, which is localized in direct proximity to PetM and PetN. In tobacco, a knock-out of the plastome-encoded petL gene did not result in any visible growth phenotype (28Fiebig A. Stegemann S. Bock R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3615-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results differ from results obtained in C. reinhardtii (29Takahashi Y. Rahire M. Breyton C. Popot J.L. Joliot P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 14: 3498-3506Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Zito F. Vinh J. Popot J.L. Finazzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12446-12455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), where deletion of PetL resulted in destabilization of Cyt-bf; the Rieske subunit is bound less tightly to the complex, and the functional dimeric state of the complex is less stable (31Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Dubacq J.P. Popot J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21892-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the Cyt-bf content dropped to 50–25% that of the wild type (WT) level during the exponential growth phase, which in turn strongly impaired cell division and growth. Remarkably, a recognizable petL gene does not exist in the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis (32Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar), possibly suggesting that the Cyt-bf in this prokaryote functions without a PetL-like subunit. In contrast, the Cyt-bf of another cyanobacterium, M. laminosus, contains a PetL subunit (21Kurisu G. Zhang H. Smith J.L. Cramer W.C. Science. 2003; 302: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), indicating that the L subunit is not an evolutionarily late acquisition in photosynthetic eukaryotes. Here, we have studied the function of the PetL subunit in detail in a higher plant, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). Despite the absence of a visible growth phenotype, the petL deletion results in an accelerated loss of the complex in mature and aging leaves. Our data indicate that the accelerated loss of Cyt-bf is due to a reduced stability of the complex in the absence of the PetL subunit. Moreover, our study provides evidence that the capacity for de novo synthesis of Cyt-bf is very low in mature and aging leaves, suggesting that the WT form of Cyt-bf is highly stable. Plant Material and Growth Conditions—ΔpetL knock-out tobacco plants (N. tabacum L. var. Petit Havana) were generated by disruption of the petL gene with the aadA selection marker as described earlier (28Fiebig A. Stegemann S. Bock R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3615-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). WT tobacco and ΔpetL mutants were grown in a controlled environment chamber at 600 μEm–2 s–1 light intensity at the uppermost leaves. Due to shading by the younger leaves, the light intensity could decrease to less than 150 μEm–2 s–1 at the level of the lower leaves. The plants were illuminated for 16 h at 22 °C. The night temperature was 18 °C. Humidity was set to 60% throughout the day. Gas Exchange Measurements and Chlorophyll a Fluorescence—Leaf assimilation capacity was determined using a closed cuvette system with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (LD2, Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, England). Measurements were performed on leaf discs in a CO2-saturated gas mixture (10% CO2) to completely suppress photorespiration. Saturating light was applied by a tungsten halogen lamp (Schott, Mainz, Germany). Chlorophyll a fluorescence was determined using a PAM-101 fluorometer (Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany). The leaves were dark-adapted for 15 min, and respiration rates were determined. After measurement of the dark-adapted FV/FM value, the actinic light was switched on, and photosynthetic oxygen evolution and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured until steady state. The chlorophyll content of the leaf discs was determined after extraction in 80% acetone (33Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedermann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). Assimilation rates were corrected for dark respiration assuming comparable respiration rates in the light and in darkness (34Fernie A.R. Carrari F. Sweetlove L.J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 35Raghavendra A.S. Padmasree K. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 546-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). State Transitions—State Transitions were measured using a Dual-PAM fluorometer (Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany). Leaves were excited using a red light LED (λ = 660 nm, 80 μE m–2 s–1 light intensity) and either blue light for predominant PSII excitation and reduction of the PQ pool (λ = 440 nm, 25 μE m–2 s–1) or far-red light (λ = 715 nm) for preferential excitation of PSI and PQ pool oxidation. Measurements were performed and analyzed according to Lunde et al. (36Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thylakoid Membrane Isolation—Thylakoid membranes were isolated as described (6Schöttler M.A. Kirchhoff H. Weis E. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 4265-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Treatments with chaotropic reagents were conducted by incubating thylakoids equivalent to 200 μg of chlorophyll ml–1 in a low salt buffer (100 μm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) with either 2 m NaBr, 2 m NaI, or 0.1 m Na2CO3 in a total volume of 1000 μl. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, thylakoids were pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 1 min) and resuspended in low salt buffer for Cyt-bf quantification. Cyt-bf and PSII Quantification—The cytochromes of the thylakoid membrane were determined in isolated thylakoids equivalent to 50 μg of chlorophyll ml–1 after destacking in a low salt medium to improve the optical properties of the sample (37Kirchhoff H. Mukjerjee U. Galla H.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The cytochromes were oxidized by the addition of 1 mm ferricyanide and subsequently reduced by the addition of 10 mm ascorbate and dithionite, resulting in reduction of Cyt-f and the high potential form of Cyt-b559 (high potential, ascorbate-ferricyanide difference absorption spectrum) and reduction of cytochrome b6 and the low potential form of Cyt-b559 (low potential, dithionite-ascorbate), respectively. At each redox potential absorption spectra were recorded between 575- and 540-nm wavelengths with a spatial resolution of 0.2 nm using a Jasco V550 spectrophotometer (Jasco, Groβ-Umstadt, Germany) equipped with a head-on photomultiplier. The spectral bandwidth of the monochromator was set to 1 nm, and the scanning speed was 100 nm min–1. A minimum of 10 spectra were averaged at each redox potential to reduce the noise contribution to the total absorption signals to less than 10–4. Before curve fitting, a base line was subtracted from the difference absorption spectra, defined by the wavelengths 540 and 575 nm. Difference absorption spectra were deconvoluted using reference spectra according to Kirchhoff et al. (37Kirchhoff H. Mukjerjee U. Galla H.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Base line-corrected difference extinction coefficients of 28.0 for Cyt-f and 24.6 for Cyt-b6 were calculated based on the difference extinction coefficients determined in Metzger et al. (38Metzger S.U. Cramer W.A. Whitmarsh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Nelson and Neumann (39Nelson N. Neumann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1817-1824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PSII contents were calculated from the sum of the Cyt-b559 high potential and low potential difference absorption signals according to Lamkemeyer et al. (40Lamkemeyer P. Laxa M. Collin V. Li W. Finkemeyer I. Schottler M.A. Holtkamp V. Tognetti V.B. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Kandlbinder A. Weis E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Dietz K.J. Plant J. 2006; 45: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). PC and P700 Redox Kinetics and Quantification—Difference absorption signals of PC and P700 were measured in the far-red range of the spectrum, essentially as described (41Kirchhoff H. Schöttler M.A. Maurer J. Weis E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1659: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The contributions of PC and P700 were deconvoluted by measuring difference absorption changes at 830–870 nm (predominantly arising from P700) and 870–950 nm (predominantly arising from PC). Measurements were done using a novel instrument developed in cooperation with Christof Klughammer and Ulrich Schreiber (Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany), which will be described elsewhere. 3M. A. Schöttler, C. Klughammer, R. Bock, and U. Schreiber, manuscript in preparation. This instrument allows the simultaneous measurement of both difference absorption signals. Measurements were done on pre-illuminated intact leaves with fully activated Calvin cycle, so that a limitation of P700 photooxidation by metabolic NADP+ regeneration could be excluded. P700 and PC were photooxidized using far-red light (715 nm wavelength), which selectively excites PSI. After a 10-s exposure to far-red light, a saturating pulse of red light (6000 μEm–2 s–1, 200 ms duration) was applied, and the far-red light was switched off, so that PC and P700 could become fully reduced again after the actinic light pulse. The reduction kinetics were fitted with a exponential function to determine the halftimes of PC and P700 reduction. For PSI quantification in isolated thylakoids, membranes equivalent to 50 μg of chlorophyll ml–1 were solubilized in a medium containing 0.2% (w/v) β-dodecyl-maltoside, 100 μm methylviologen as the artificial electron acceptor, and 10 mm ascorbate as donor. P700, determined as described for measurements on intact leaves, was photooxidized by application of a saturating pulse of red light (6000 μE m–2 s–1 light intensity, 200-ms duration). Protein Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Thylakoid proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the Perfect Blue twin gel system (PeqLab GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond P, Amersham Biosciences) using a semidry blotting system (SEDEC-M, PeqLab) and a standard transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3). Immunobiochemical detection was carried out with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Gene Expression Analysis—RNA was extracted from leaves using peqGoldTrifast reagent (Peqlab). To eliminate polysaccharide contaminations from RNA preparations from old leaves, all samples were subjected to an additional purification step using the NucleoSpin RNA Clean-up kit (Macherey & Nagel, Düren, Germany). Samples equivalent to 8 μg of RNA were separated in 1% formaldehyde-containing agarose gels and blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond-XL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For hybridization, [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes were generated by random priming (Amersham Biosciences) following the instructions of the manufacturer. A petB-specific probe was prepared by PCR amplification with primers PpetB5 (5′-TGTATTTCCGGAGTATGAG-3′) and PpetB3 (5′-CTCTATAAAGGCCAGAAA-3′) using total plant cDNA as a template. A hybridization probe specific for the Rieske iron-sulfur protein was amplified from cDNA with primers PRi5 (5′-CCAGCAGATGATAGAGTGCCTG-3′) and PRi3 (5′-TGAGCCAATGCCAAGGACAAAG-3′). A plastocyanin-specific probe was generated from PCR-amplified cDNA with primers PPc5 (5′-ACTCGAGTATTGAAGTGTTGCTTGGTAGCGATG-3′) and pPc3 (5′-TTGAATTCATCCACACCAGCTGGGATTTCATC-3′). Hybridizations were performed at 65 °C in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. Hybridization signals were quantified using a Typhoon Trio+ variable mode imager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant 5.2 software. Signal intensities were corrected for equal loading of the agarose gels by normalizing to the ribosomal RNA signals determined after ethidium bromide staining using the Infinity 1000 gel documentation system (PeqLab). Growth Phenotype and Leaf Assimilation Capacities—Tobacco petL knock-out mutants generated by chloroplast transformation do not display any visible growth phenotype (28Fiebig A. Stegemann S. Bock R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3615-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Both flowering time and number of leaf generations per plant are identical with WT plants. Also, the chlorophyll contents per leaf area are about identical in WT and mutant plants, with the highest chlorophyll contents measured in youngest leaves (600 mg of Chl m–2) and the lowest contents found in the oldest leaves (350 mg of Chl m–2). Therefore, the corresponding leaf generations of transformants and WT plants can be directly compared. For most experiments, tobacco plants at the onset of flowering were used. Leaf assimilation capacities were determined from photosynthetic O2 evolution in saturating light and 10% CO2. Under these conditions, photorespiration is repressed, so that photosynthetic O2 production directly reflects the maximum leaf assimilation capacity (6Schöttler M.A. Kirchhoff H. Weis E. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 4265-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The youngest leaves that were sufficiently large to be used in gas exchange measurements were leaves no. 2 (from the top of the plant). In both WT and ΔpetL plants, these leaves had comparable average assimilation capacities of 500 μmol of electron pairs mg of Chl–1 h–1 (Fig. 1A). For WT plants, an about 50% reduction of leaf assimilation capacity was observed from leaf no. 2 down to the oldest leaf measured (leaf no. 12). The slow decrease in assimilation capacity started from leaf number 4, which was the first fully expanded and mature leaf, downward. In the ΔpetL mutant, the decrease of assimilation capacity was strongly accelerated, with the assimilation capacity of the oldest leaves being only about 100 μmol of electron pairs mg of Chl–1 h–1. In parallel to this strong reduction of assimilation, the capacity for non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of oversaturating light intensities was also found to be significantly reduced in the mutant plants (Fig. 1B). In WT leaves, the NPQ capacity was about constant (0.8), independent of leaf age. In contrast, the NPQ capacity of older mutant leaves was strongly decreased. Whereas young mutant leaves had only slightly lower NPQ capacities than the WT, NPQ declined strongly from leaf no. 6 downward to levels of only about 0.5. These changes in NPQ indicate that, in addition to assimilation, also thylakoid membrane energizing is increasingly impaired with leaf age in ΔpetL plants. Both effects can most probably be explained with a leaf-age dependent limitation of electron flux at the level of the Cyt-bf. Linear Electron Flux Is Strongly Reduced in Mature and Old Mutant Leaves—To directly demonstrate the strong limitation of photosynthetic electron flux in mature and old mutant leaves at the level of Cyt-bf, chlorophyll a fluorescence relaxation and redox kinetics of PC and P700 were determined in intact leaves. A saturating light pulse (6000 μE m–2 s–1, 200-ms duration) was applied to completely oxidize the high potential chain and reduce the PQ pool. Afterward, the dark reduction kinetics of PC and P700 and the reoxidation of the PQ pool were determined. Normally, these reactions are rate limited by PQ reoxidation at the Cyt-bf (5Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1456: 5-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, kinetics of P700 reduction are presented. In young mutant and WT leaves (Fig. 2A), halftimes of 4 to 5 ms were determined for P700 reduction, in agreement with the reported turnover time of PQ oxidation at Cyt-bf and the rate of electron flow through the high potential chain under optimum fluxes (5Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1456: 5-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In agreement with the 50% reduction of assimilation capacity in old WT leaves (Fig. 1), the P700 reduction halftime increased to about 10 ms. In the transformants, however, the halftime was increased to more than 40 ms, indicating that electron flux toward PSI is strongly limited in the mutants (Fig. 2B). Chlorophyll a fluorescence relaxation revealed a comparable block in PQ reoxidation in old mutant leaves (data not shown), strongly suggesting that photosynthetic electron transport is indeed limited a"

Lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), the main enzyme responsible for retinyl ester formation, acts by transferring an acyl group from the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine to retinol. To define the membrane association and localization of LRAT, we produced an LRAT-specific monoclonal antibody, which we used to study enzyme partition under different experimental conditions. Furthermore, we examined the membrane topology of LRAT through an N-linked glycosylation scanning approach and protease protection assays. We show that LRAT is localized to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and assumes a single membrane-spanning topology with an N-terminal cytoplasmic/C-terminal luminal orientation. In eukaryotic cells, the C-terminal transmembrane domain is essential for the activity and ER membrane targeting of LRAT. In contrast, the N-terminal hydrophobic region is not required for ER membrane targeting or enzymatic activity, and its amino acid sequence is not conserved in other species examined. We present experimental evidence of the topology and subcellular localization of LRAT, a critical enzyme in vitamin A metabolism.

Zolfaghari R. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 269S-275SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). LRAT catalyzes the synthesis of retinyl esters, thereby drawing retinol from the circulation to storage depots such as the lipid droplets of hepatic stellate cells and the retinosome structures found in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (8Imanishi Y. Batten M.L. Piston D.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9Imanishi Y. Gerke V. Palczewski K. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mutations in the LRAT gene lead to early-onset severe retinal dystrophy (10Thompson D.A. Li Y. McHenry C.L. Carlson T.J. Ding X. Sieving P.A. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Gal A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 123-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Disruption of the Lrat gene in Lrat-/- mice produces a severe impairment in retinol uptake and storage capacity. As a result, Lrat-/- mice are blind (11Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C.

Lrat-/- mice possess only trace amounts of retinyl esters in most tissues (11Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Adipose stores of retinyl esters could depend on the activity of acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase (12O'Byrne S.M. Wongsiriroj N. Libien J. Vogel S. Goldberg I.J. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35647-35657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).LRAT plays a pivotal role in determining retinol availability, which in turn affects the levels of all-trans-retinoic acid, a potent regulator of the expression of many genes via retinoic acid receptors (13Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2587) Google Scholar). Expression of LRAT in the liver is influenced by multiple factors, including vitamin A status (14Randolph R.K. Ross A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16453-16457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), retinoic acid (15Wang X.D. Krinsky N.I. Russell R.M. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), other synthetic retinoic acid receptor activators (16Matsuura T. Zhao Z. Ross A.C. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2474-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ agonists (17Hellemans K. Rombouts K. Quartier E. Dittie A.S. Knorr A. Michalik L. Rogiers V. Schuit F. Wahli W. Geerts A. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 280-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of LRAT activity provides a homeostatic mechanism whereby circulating retinol levels are kept relatively constant despite fluctuations in the dietary intake of retinol (18Olson J.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1984; 73: 1439-1444PubMed Google Scholar).Properties of the LRAT-catalyzed reaction have been investigated using homogenates or microsomal fractions from the liver or RPE (19Andrews J.S. Futterman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 4073-4076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Krinsky N.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 232: 881-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These early studies showed that LRAT is most likely a membrane protein that transfers acyl groups from the sn-1 position of phospholipids to retinol via an acyl-enzyme intermediate (21MacDonald P.N. Ong D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8636-8640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although both LRAT and acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase retinol-esterifying activities are present in liver homogenates, they can be distinguished because LRAT prefers retinol bound to cellular retinol-binding protein I or II and phosphatidylcholine as substrates, whereas acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase uses free retinol and fatty acyl-CoA as substrates (21MacDonald P.N. Ong D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 23Ong D.E. Kakkad B. MacDonald P.N. J. Biol.

The cloning of full-length LRAT cDNA by Ruiz et al. (25Ruiz A. Winston A. Lim Y.H. Gilbert B.A. Rando R.R. Bok D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3834-3841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) allowed investigation of the contribution of different residues to the acyltransferase reaction. On the basis of site-directed mutagenesis and acyltransferase assays, Cys161, Tyr154, and His60 were proposed to form a catalytic triad that is directly involved in the LRAT-catalyzed esterification reaction (26Xue L. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6120-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Deletion of the putative N- and C-terminal transmembrane domains of LRAT leads to production of active enzyme when expressed in bacteria (27Bok D. Ruiz A. Yaron O. Jahng W.J. Ray A. Xue L. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6090-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These results argue that the N and C termini are not necessary for the enzymatic activity of LRAT. On the basis of hydropathy analysis, LRAT was predicted to have its catalytic domain in the cytoplasm and to anchor to the membrane via its putative N- and C-terminal transmembrane domains (28Jahng W.J. Cheung E. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6311-6319Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Here, we present experimental evidence that LRAT is a single membrane-spanning protein with an N-terminal domain that faces the cytoplasm. Elimination of the C- but not N-terminal hydrophobic domain led to a large reduction in acyltransferase activity and mislocalization of the protein when expressed in eukaryotic cells. This study provides a basis for understanding the subcellular localization and function of LRAT in eukaryotic cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression of Mutant LRAT Proteins—The mouse full-length WT LRAT cDNA cloned in pCR-Blunt-II-TOPO (Invitrogen) served as a template for amplification and mutagenesis reactions. Truncation mutants of LRAT were constructed as follows. Ntm LRAT (lacking the putative C-terminal transmembrane domain; corresponding to Met1-Ser195) was amplified with primers 5′-CACCATGAAGAACCCAATGCTGGA and 5′-TCAACTGCTTCTCTGATCACGAATGA; tLRAT (lacking both the putative N- and C-terminal transmembrane domains; corresponding to Gly35-Ser195) was amplified using primers 5′-CACCATGGGGAAGAACCGTCCCTATGA and 5′-TCAACTGCTTCTCTGATCACGAATGA; and Ctm LRAT (lacking the putative N-terminal transmembrane domain; corresponding to Gly35-Gly231) was amplified using primers 5′-CACCATGGGGAAGAACCGTCCCTATGA and 5′-CTAGCCAGACATCATCCACA. PCR products were first cloned into the pCR-Blunt-II-TOPO vector and then subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA4/TO under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. For site-directed mutagenesis, we used the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol and mouse WT LRAT cloned in pCR-Blunt-II-TOPO as a template. For the I42N mutation, we used primer 5′-CGTCCCTATGAAAACAGCTCTTTCGTCCG (with the nucleotide mutated from the WT sequence underlined) and its reverse complementary pair; and for the D128N mutation, we used primer 5′-GTCAATCACCTAAACGGGACTCTCAAG primer and its reverse complementary pair. The mutated LRAT cDNA inserts were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA4/TO. To produce fusions of LRAT with amino acid residues 1-21 of bovine rhodopsin (Rho; MNGTEGPNFYVPFSNKTGVVR), we used the following primers to amplify the sequence of mouse LRAT: for Rho-LRAT, primer 5′-ACCATGAACGGGACCGAGGGCCCAAACTTCTACGTGCCTTTCTCCAACAAGACGGGCGTGGTGCGCATGAAGAACCCAATGCTGGAAGCT (with the rhodopsin sequence underlined) and reverse primer 5′-CTAGCCAGACATCATCCACA; and for LRAT-Rho, primer 5′-CACCATGAAGAACCCAATGCTGGAAGCT and reverse primer 5′-CTAGCGCACCACGCCCGTCTTGTTGGAGAAAGGCACGTAGAAGTTTGGGCCCTCGGTCCCGTTCATGCCAGACATCATCCACAAGCAGAA. The PCR products were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA4/TO. Both strands of all constructs were sequenced to ensure that no mutations were present. T-REx-293 cells (Invitrogen) are HEK-293 cells (29Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3468) Google Scholar) that stably express the tetracycline repressor protein and were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Transient transfection of T-REx-293 or COS-7 (30Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar) cells with the various LRAT constructs was done 48 h before analysis using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The fragment coding for tLRAT (corresponding to Gly35-Ser195) was also subcloned into the EcoRI site of the bacterial expression vector pET-30b(+) (Novagen) in-frame with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and transformed for expression in bacterial BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen).Mapping the Epitope of an Anti-LRAT Monoclonal Antibody—An anti-mouse LRAT monoclonal antibody was raised against a bacterially expressed His-tagged fragment of mouse LRAT corresponding to Gln89-Glu179 as described previously (11Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10422-10432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The following primers were used to amplify the sequence of LRAT and to further subdivide the antigenic region of LRAT into three overlapping fragments: for LRAT1 (corresponding to Gln89-Gly129), primers 5′-GGATCCCAGAAGGTGGTCTCCAACAAGC and 5′-CTCGAGTCCCGTCTAGGTGATTGACTAGGA; for LRAT2 (corresponding to Gly119-Gly150), primers 5′-GGATCCGGAGCAGACATCCTAGTCAATCAC and 5′-CTCGAGTTCCCAACTGCTGCTCAGCTCTG; and for LRAT3 (corresponding to Val141-Glu179), primers 5′-GGATCCGTGGCACGCAGAGCTGAGCAG and 5′-CTCGAGTCTCAGCCTGTGGACTGATCCG. PCR products were cloned into the BamHI-XhoI sites of the pGEX-4T-2 vector (GE Healthcare) downstream of and in-frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) open reading frame. The GST-LRAT fusion constructs were transformed for expression into bacterial BL21RP cells. Expression of GST fused to LRAT1, -2, or -3 was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. Expression of purified proteins was examined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The presence of the epitope was assayed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of bacterial lysates from cells expressing the GST-LRAT fragment proteins using the anti-LRAT monoclonal antibody.Solubilization Studies of LRAT—A suspension of bovine RPE microsomes (∼400 μg of total protein) (31Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 190: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) containing endogenous LRAT was diluted three times with 50 mm BisTris propane (pH 7.4). The appropriate concentration of salt or detergent was achieved by the addition of stock solutions of NaCl, CHAPS, n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside, SDS, and 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC). The final volumes of these mixtures were fixed at 1 ml. Samples were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were examined directly for enzymatic activity of LRAT, and pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of the given detergent solution prior to enzyme assays. The presence of the RPE-specific 65-kDa protein RPE65 and LRAT proteins was verified by immunoblot analysis using the anti-LRAT monoclonal antibody (11Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10422-10432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and an anti-RPE65 polyclonal antibody (a gift from Dr. J. Saari, University of Washington).Protease Protection Assays—Aliquots of RPE microsomes (50 μg of protein) (31Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 190: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were resuspended in Bis-Tris propane (pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.6 or 2.4 units/ml proteinase K (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100 (total reaction volume of 30 μl). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Proteolysis was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 5 mm. Samples were boiled for 5 min in 6× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and examined by immunoblotting using the anti-LRAT monoclonal antibody or a rabbit anti-calreticulin polyclonal antibody (Sigma).Endoglycosidase F and Tunicamycin Treatment and Immunoblot Analysis—Expression WT LRAT, I42N-LRAT, D128N-LRAT, Rho-LRAT, or LRAT-Rho containing N-linked glycosylation signals in T-REx-293 cells was induced with tetracycline added 24 h before analysis. For tunicamycin-treated cells, we incubated cells with 1 μg/ml tunicamycin 3 h before and throughout the tetracycline induction. Tunicamycin-treated and untreated controls were examined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-LRAT monoclonal antibody. Where indicated, the lysate of LRAT-expressing cells was divided in two equal fractions, one for endoglycosidase F treatment and one for control treatment. Proteins were briefly denatured for 15 min at 95 °C in 0.05% SDS and then cooled and supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), and 500 units/reaction endoglycosidase F (New England Biolabs) for treated samples; endoglycosidase F was omitted in control samples. The deglycosylation reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37°C with shaking, following which samples were treated with 1% SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the anti-LRAT monoclonal antibody.LRAT Activity Assays—LRAT activity was assayed in vitro using 20 μl of RPE microsomes (31Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 190: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), 100 μl of homogenates from COS-7 cells transfected with various LRAT constructs, or 100 μl of bacterial lysate expressing mouse tLRAT. Reactions were carried out in Bis-Tris propane (pH 7.5) supplemented with 5 mm DHPC, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 20 μm all-trans-retinol. Activity assays of RPE fractions or bacterial lysates contained all-trans-retinol at a final concentration of 20 μm delivered in N,N-dimethylformamide. Total volumes of the reaction mixtures were fixed at 200 μl. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 15 min and then stopped by the addition of 300 μl of methanol. Retinoids were extracted with 300 μl of hexane. Alternatively, Km and Vmax values for WT LRAT and its truncation mutants expressed in COS-7 cells were derived from steady-state kinetic measurements. Reactions were performed using 10 μg of protein from homogenates of transfected COS-7 in Bis-Tris propane supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Reactions were initiated by the addition of all-trans-retinol diluted in N,N-dimethylformamide. To determine saturation of enzyme with substrate, we used seven different final concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 4 μm. Product formation was measured during initial reaction velocity conditions. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 2 min and then quenched by the addition of 100 μl of methanol. Retinoids were extracted with 200 μl of hexane and analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard 1100 series HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector and a Beckman Ultrasphere Si normal-phase column (5 μm, 4.5 × 250 mm) (32Moise A.R. Kuksa V. Imanishi Y. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50230-50242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The initial velocity data were analyzed using the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression analysis. Km and Vmax values were calculated based on Lineweaver-Burk plots derived from data obtained from three independent experiments.Two-photon Vitamin A Imaging and Immunohistochemistry—RPE cells obtained from WT or Lrat-/- mice were stained using the anti-LRAT monoclonal antibody (11Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

We transiently transfected COS-7 cells to study the targeting and distribution of WT LRAT and its truncation mutants. Formation of retinosomes (retinyl ester storage particles) was studied in vitro in stably transfected HEKK-LRAT cells, which express mouse WT LRAT under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (32Moise A.R. Kuksa V. Imanishi Y. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50230-50242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium on glass-bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). Expression of LRAT was induced in HEKK-LRAT cells with tetracycline added 48 h before analysis. The medium was supplemented 24 h before analysis with all-trans-retinol (10 μm) or oleic acid (0.1 mm). Medium containing substrates was overlaid on cells and incubated overnight in the dark at 37 °C in 5% CO2 under 100% humidity. Immunohistochemical staining was performed by fixing HEKK-LRAT cells or transiently transfected COS-7 cells with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 136 mm NaCl and 11.4 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4)) for 10 min. Cells were washed three times with PBST (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100), followed by incubation in 1.5% normal goat serum in PBST for 15 min at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. Staining was done overnight at 4 °C with the anti-LRAT monoclonal antibody (11Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Cells were rinsed in PBST three times and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen) for detection of anti-BiP immunofluorescence or with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for detection of calreticulin. To detect anti-LRAT immunoreactivity, we rinsed sections in PBST three times and then incubated them with either Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for the results presented in Fig. 3 or with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for the results presented in Figs. 2, 5, and 7. Cells were mounted in 2% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane in 90% glycerol to retard photobleaching. For detection of neutral lipid, we incubated cells with 10 μg/ml Nile red (9-diethylamino-5H-benzo[α]phenoxazine-5-one; Invitrogen) in PBS. Intrinsic fluorescence of retinyl esters was visualized by two-photon microscopy (8Imanishi Y. Batten M.L. Piston D.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The images were obtained using either a confocal/two-photon microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 MP-NLO) with a mode-locked titanium/sapphire laser (Mira 900, Coherent, Inc., Mountain View, CA) or a Leica TCS SP2 confocal/multiphoton microscope equipped with a titanium/sapphire laser (Chameleon™-XR, Coherent, Inc.).FIGURE 2Characterization of the epitope recognized by the anti-LRAT monoclonal antibody. The fragment of LRAT used to produce the anti-LRAT monoclonal antibody (Gln89-Glu179) was further subdivided into three smaller overlapping fragments, i.e. LRAT1 (corresponding to Gln89-Gly129), LRAT2 (corresponding to Gly119-Gly150), and LRAT3 (corresponding to Val141-Glu179).

The previously postulated N-terminal transmembrane domain (28Jahng W.J. Cheung E. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6311-6319Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 33Ruiz A. Kuehn M.H.

The orientation of transmembrane domains can be predicted from the net charge difference between the two regions flanking the transmembrane domain (34Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl.

https://openalex.org/W1967109444,"Yeast Rna15 and its vertebrate orthologue CstF-64 play critical roles in mRNA 3 ′-end processing and in transcription termination downstream of poly(A) sites. These proteins contain N-terminal domains that recognize the poly(A) site, but little is known about their highly conserved C-terminal regions. Here we show by NMR that the C-terminal domains of CstF-64 and Rna15 fold into a three-helix bundle with an uncommon topological arrangement. The structure defines a cluster of evolutionary conserved yet exposed residues we show to be essential for the interaction between Pcf11 and Rna15. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this interaction is critical for the function of Rna15 in 3 ′-end processing but dispensable for transcription termination. The C-terminal domain of the Rna15 homologue Pti1 contains critical sequence alterations within this region that are predicted to prevent Pcf11 interaction, providing an explanation for the distinct functions of these two closely related proteins in the 3 ′-end formation of RNA polymerase II transcripts. These results define the role of the C-terminal half of Rna15 and provide insight into the network of protein/protein interactions responsible for assembly of the 3 ′-end processing apparatus. Yeast Rna15 and its vertebrate orthologue CstF-64 play critical roles in mRNA 3 ′-end processing and in transcription termination downstream of poly(A) sites. These proteins contain N-terminal domains that recognize the poly(A) site, but little is known about their highly conserved C-terminal regions.

The formation of the 3′-ends of eukaryotic mRNA by cleavage and polyadenylation occurs co-transcriptionally and is intimately linked to splicing, assembly of an export-competent messenger ribonucleoprotein complex (mRNP), 7The abbreviations used are: mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein; RNAP, RNA polymerase; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DTT, dithiothreitol; MBP, myelin basic protein; snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; CTD, C-terminal domain; RRM, RNA recognition motif; CF IA, cleavage factor IA; CPF, cleavage and polyadenylation factor. and nuclear surveillance mechanisms that monitor the quality of the exported mRNP (1Bentley D.L.

Transcription termination requires the 3′-end processing machinery as well as a 5′-3′-exonuclease (4Kim M. Ahn S.H. Krogan N.J. Greenblatt J.F. Buratowski S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 5Luo W. Johnson A.W. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 954-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6West S. Gromak N.

The precise nature of the interactions between the polyadenylation and transcription machineries and of their changes during transcription termination remains to be elucidated. To fully understand these connections and their regulation, it is important to develop a clear picture of the organization and function of the polyadenylation machinery at a molecular level. Among the proteins that ensure a communication between transcription and 3′-end processing are human CstF-64 and its Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue Rna15, two of the earliest identified components of the polyadenylation machinery (7Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Keller W. Science. 1994; 266: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 8Takagaki Y. MacDonald C.C. Shenk T. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1403-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These proteins play a key role in mRNA 3′-end processing by recognizing one of the signal sequences that specify poly(A) sites (9MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Mol. Cell.

Altering the levels of CstF-64 or mutating Rna15 can shift the pattern of poly(A) site utilization when multiple processing sites are present on the same transcript (11Chennathukuzhi V.M.

Defects in Rna15 also have consequences on mRNP biogenesis that transcend 3′-end processing, such as hindering transcription elongation and preventing transcription termination downstream of poly(A) sites (16Luna R.

The G/U-rich sequences that represent binding sites for CstF-64 are essential for proper termination of transcription (19Connelly S. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), indicating that the functions of Rna15 and CstF-64 in transcription are conserved as well. Mutation of RNA15 also causes poor recruitment of the Yra1 export factor to actively transcribed genes (20Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2761-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), retention of mRNA in the nucleus (18Hammell C.M. Gross S. Zenklusen D. Heath C.V. Stutz F. Moore C. Cole C.N. Mol. Cell.

Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8254-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The defective mRNPs produced by Rna15 mutant cells are recognized and degraded by the nuclear exosome (23Torchet C. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Milligan L. Thompson E. Kufel J. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1285-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The Rna15 and CstF-64 proteins are closely related in sequence and structure at their N and C termini (Fig. 1A). These two proteins are also homologous to Pti1 (24Skaar D.A. Greenleaf A.L. Mol.

These three proteins contain RRM-type RNA binding domains at their N termini that are both necessary and sufficient for RNA binding (27Deka P. Rajan P.K. Perez-Canadillas J.M. Varani G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 719-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Perez Canadillas J.M. Varani G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 29Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3907-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Mutation of conserved amino acids in this motif within Rna15 impairs the ability of Rna15 to interact with RNA and to function in mRNA 3′-end processing (10Gross S. Moore C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8045-8055Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Metazoan CstF-64 proteins have a conserved 100 amino acid region called the “hinge” immediately C-terminal to the RRM that is also found in Pti1 and Rna15 (24Skaar D.A. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1429-1439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This region of CstF-64 interacts with CstF-77 and with Symplekin, a protein implicated in the assembly of several RNA 3′-end processing machineries (30Barnard D.C. Ryan K. Manley J.L. Richter J.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 641-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 31Dominski Z. Yang X.C. Marzluff W.F.

Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The hinge domain of Pti1 interacts with Rna14 and Pta1, the yeast orthologues of CstF-77 and Symplekin, respectively (24Skaar D.A. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1429-1439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The central region of CstF-64 is variable in length and composition, and its function is unknown. In most metazoans, it is rich in proline and glycine and contains up to a dozen repeats of the MEAR(A/G) motif, which are missing altogether in worms and fungi (32Hatton L.S. Eloranta J.J. Figueiredo L.M. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. O'Hare K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The 50 amino acids at the very C terminus of the Rna15/CstF-64 family are even more highly conserved than the N-terminal RRM. A mutant of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue, Ctf1, lacking the last 70 amino acids (including this C-terminal domain) caused transcription to continue downstream of the poly(A) site, leading to the proposal that this region participates in termination of transcription (35Aranda A. Proudfoot N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, the last 100 or so amino acids of Rna15/hCstF-64, and of Ctf1, were shown genetically and biochemically to interact directly with the transcription factors Sub1/PC4 and Res2 (35Aranda A. Proudfoot N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Calvo O. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This region in Ctf1 is thought to function only in transcription termination and not in 3′-end processing, because its loss does not affect accumulation of properly processed mRNA in vivo (35Aranda A. Proudfoot N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1003-1011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of the Rna15/CstF64 C terminus in cleavage and polyadenylation has not been addressed. Rna15 is part of CF IA (37Kessler M.M. Zhao J. Moore C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27167-27175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 38Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Wiederkehr T. Strahm Y. Keller W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7897-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and interacts directly with the Rna14 and Pcf11 subunits of this factor (39Gross S. Moore C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6080-6085Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and with the poly(A)-binding protein Pab1 (40Amrani N. Minet M. Le Gouar M. Lacroute F. Wyers F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3694-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The interaction between Rna15 and Pcf11 is particularly interesting in light of recent reports that provide a role for the N terminus of Pcf11 in the promotion of transcription termination (41Zhang Z. Gilmour D.S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 65-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 42Zhang Z. Fu J. Gilmour D.S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the domains of Rna15 important for the contacts with Rna14 and Pcf11, and the role of these interactions in 3′-end processing and termination, have not been delineated. The three-dimensional organization of the regions of the protein beyond the RRM also remains to be determined. In this study, we have investigated the interaction of the C-terminal half of Rna15 with Rna14, Sub1, and Pcf11. We report that the C-terminal domain of the Rna15/CstF-64 protein family forms an unusual structure of three helices that positions highly conserved residues on the protein surface to mediate protein/protein interactions. We demonstrate that this highly conserved domain functions in the cleavage and polyadenylation of mRNA precursors by providing a contact site for Pcf11, whereas the region of the protein just N-terminal to it interacts with Rna14 and Sub1. These studies provide structural and biochemical insight into highly conserved protein/protein interactions responsible for assembly of the 3′-end processing apparatus in all eukaryotes. Yeast Strains, Media, and Plasmids—The yeast strains LM31 (MATa RNA15::TRP1 ura3-1 trp1-1 ade2-1 leu2-3,112 his3-11, plus pLM13 containing RNA15 and URA3) was a gift from F. Lacroute (43Minvielle-Sebastia L. Winsor B. Bonneaud N. Lacroute F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3075-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the pcf11-9 and isogenic wild-type strains were a gift from W. Keller (44Sadowski M. Dichtl B. Hubner W. Keller W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Yeasts were grown and maintained on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or on selective media as needed. For temperature sensitivity assays, yeasts were grown at 16, 25, 30, and 37 °C. Loss of URA3 plasmids from yeast cells was accomplished by plating on solid medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. The RNA15-His6 coding sequence from plasmid pET21b/Rna15 (37Kessler M.M. Zhao J. Moore C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27167-27175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the LEU2 vector Yeplac181 to generate Yeplac-RNA15H6. Truncations of the RNA15 open reading frame from the 3′-end were amplified using the primers listed in Table 1 and cloned into pET21b (Novagen) between the NdeI and XhoI sites. The mutants rna15-CTD1 and rna15CTD2 were constructed using a forward PCR primer (supplemental Table 1) containing the desired mutation and a reverse primer corresponding to the end of the RNA15 coding sequence. The wild-type BamHI/NdeI fragment on pET21b/Rna15 was then replaced with the mutated PCR fragment digested with BamHI and NdeI. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. BclI-BlpI fragments from these mutant rna15 constructs were subcloned into BclI-BlpI-treated Yeplac-RNA15H6. This was accomplished by first growing the plasmids in the dam-Escherichia coli strain UF253. All of the Yeplac-RNA15H6 variants were transformed into LM31 for expression in yeast and phenotypic studies. Additional truncations of Rna15 (t1, t2, t3, t4, and t5, see supplemental Table I) were also made. These behaved identically to rna15-t6 in terms of cell viability and interactions with RNA, Pcf11, Rna14, and Sub1 (data not shown). The plasmids pET21b/RNA14 (37Kessler M.M. Zhao J. Moore C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27167-27175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and pRSETB-SUB1 (36Calvo O. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) were used for in vitro translation of Rna14 and Sub1. The Rna15/His6-Rna14 complex was expressed using the pET-Duet-1 plasmid (Novagen), a gift from I. Taylor (45Noble C.G. Walker P.A. Calder L.J. Taylor I.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3364-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To express Pcf11, the PCF11 coding sequence was cloned into the pMAL vector (New England Biolabs) to give pMAL-PCF11. For purification of Sub1 from yeast, the SUB1 open reading frame was cloned into the pYES2CT vector (Invitrogen), which introduced the V5/His6 tag onto the C terminus and allowed galactose-induced expression from a high copy plasmid.TABLE 1NMR constraints and structural statisticsExperimental constraintsDistance constraintsIntra-residue239Sequential177Medium range (≤i + 4)226Long range (>i + 4)42Dihedral angle constraintsΦ24Ψ24Structure calculation (over 30 converged structures)CYANA target function0.58-1.36No. of violations >0.2 Å0No. of violations <0.2 Å0-6Root mean square deviation (pairwise) in ÅBackbone (residues 531-571)0.74 ± 0.33All heavy atoms1.16 ± 0.34 Open table in a new tab Protein Expression and Purification—His6-tagged recombinant Rna15 and its truncations were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). A 1-liter culture was grown to an OD of 0.6, followed by induction with 1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside for 3-4 h at 37 °C before harvesting. Protein purification was done as described (39Gross S. Moore C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6080-6085Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were disrupted in binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7), 500 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 mm pepstatin, and 0.6 mm leupeptin. The cell lysate was allowed to bind to 1 ml of Talon resin (Clontech) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acidagarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4°C with gentle agitation. Washings were performed for 10 min each for two times in wash buffer 1 (binding buffer plus 5 mm imidazole (pH 7)), 10 min each for two times in wash buffer 2 (wash buffer 1 lacking 0.1% Nonidet P-40), and 10 min each for two times in wash buffer 3 (same as wash buffer 2 but with 125 mm KCl). Proteins were eluted with 100 mm imidazole in wash buffer 3. The eluate was dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm pepstatin A, and 0.6 mm leupeptin with two buffer changes for 1 h each (3 h total). Pcf11 was expressed as an MBP fusion from pMAL-PCF11 in E. coli and purified on amylose resin following the protocol provided by New England Biolabs. The His6-Rna14/Rna15 heterodimer was expressed as described by Noble et al. (45Noble C.G. Walker P.A. Calder L.J. Taylor I.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3364-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Sub1-V5/His6 was purified from the yeast strain INVSc1 (Invitrogen) transformed with pYES-Sub1, in which expression was induced by growth in selective medium containing 2% galactose. Cells were lysed with the yeastBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and Sub1-V5/His6 was purified by nickel-affinity purification (Qiagen) using a wash buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. 35S-Labeled Rna14 and Sub1 proteins were made by in vitro coupled transcription and translation (TnT) reactions using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. One microgram of plasmid was used in each TnT reaction. For structural investigations, different CstF-64, Rna15, and PC4 protein constructs were subcloned into pET-28 (Novagen). Proteins were overexpressed in BL21(DE3) cells or Rosetta (DE3) pLysS strains (Novagen) by induction with 1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside at a cell density of 0.5 OD. Expression was conducted in M9 minimal media containing d-[13C]glucose and/or [15N]ammonium chloride, as needed. The CstF-64 and Rna15 constructs were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Following digestion with thrombin to remove the hexahistidine tag, the solution was filtered and reloaded onto the Ni2+ affinity column. The protein-containing flow-through was concentrated and further purified by gel filtration. No detectable impurities were found for any of the constructs investigated by gel electrophoresis or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. Because of relatively poor protein expression for Rna15, the structural analysis was focused on CstF-64. Full-length and N-terminal truncated (residues 1-63) PC4 proteins (supplemental Table II) were phosphorylated in vitro with casein kinase II (New England Biolabs). Each 10-μl phosphorylation reaction contained 0.2 mm protein, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 10 units of casein kinase II. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and quenched with 10 μl of SDS loading solution. Phosphorylation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis and by mass spectrometry, which showed a shift of 380 Da above the unphosphorylated PC4 peak, indicating that five phosphates on average were incorporated into PC4. Pulldown Assays—To test the interaction with Rna14 and Sub1, 5 μg of Rna15 protein (or its truncated derivatives) were bound to 15 μl of Talon beads (Clontech) for 1 h at 4 °C in 200 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40 (IP-150). After 1 h, 15 μl of His6 peptide (10 mg/ml) was added, and the proteins were incubated for 1 h at 4°C. 10 μl of the TnT reaction containing 35S-labeled Rna14 was then added, along with an additional 15 μl of H is 6 peptide, 2 units of RNase A, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum to reduce nonspecific binding. Following incubation on a rotating shaker at 4 °C for 1 h, the beads were washed four times in IP-150. The bound products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Radioactive proteins were visualized on a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare), whereas Rna15 protein variants were identified by silver staining. A similar procedure was followed for pulldowns with Sub1, but 1 μg of Rna15 protein or its truncations were used, and the beads were saturated by 20 μl of H is 6, followed by addition of 10 μl of the TnT reaction containing 35S-labeled Sub1. The binding of the second protein to Talon beads in the presence of saturating amounts of His6 peptide was used as a background control. To assay the interaction of Rna15 and Pcf11, 20 μl of a 50% slurry of amylose resin (New England Biolabs) was pre-washed and incubated with MBP-Pcf11 (4 μg) for 1 h in 200 μl of IP-150 buffer at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1.4 ml of IP-150 and then resuspended in 200 μl of IP-150 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Wild-type or mutated Rna15 (4 μg) proteins were then added and incubated on a rotating shaker for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by four washes with IP-150 buffer. The bound products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by immunoblotting with Rna15 polyclonal antibody; MBP protein (instead of MBP-Pcf11) was added for all control reactions. Pulldowns with Sub1-V5/His6 were performed by binding Sub-V5/His6 to anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) on recombinant protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen), and proteins detected by immunoblotting with the Rna15 polyclonal antibody. Poly(U) Binding Assays—Poly(U)-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were washed and equilibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions prior to use in order to remove any unbound poly(U). 20 μl of beads were then bound to 1 μg of recombinant Rna15 (or its truncations) at 4 °C for 1 h in 1ml of PU buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 100 mm KCl). Bovine serum albumin was used as a negative control. Unbound proteins were removed by three 1-ml washes of PU buffer. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. RNA Processing Assays and ChIP Analysis—Yeast cell extracts were prepared as described previously (46Chen J. Moore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).

Reactions were prepared on ice and incubated first at 4 °C for 10 min and then at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of proteinase K and SDS, brought to a volume of 30 μl with Tris-EDTA (pH 7.5), and extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v). One-tenth of the reaction was resolved on a 5% acrylamide, 8.3 m urea gel and then visualized by using a PhosphorImager. For ChIP analysis, in vivo cross-linking with formaldehyde, preparations of chromatin and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (4Kim M. Ahn S.H. Krogan N.J. Greenblatt J.F.

NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Determination—NMR studies of CstF-64 used 1 mm protein in 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), unless otherwise stated. Much lower concentrations (0.3 mm) were used for Rna15 because of poor protein expression. Spectra were recorded at 600 or 500 MHz on Bruker DMX or Avance spectrometers. 15N-Labeled samples of CstF-64-(504-574) and CstF-64-(531-574) were used to record homonuclear (NOESY and TOCSY spectra) and 15N-edited heteronuclear data (15N-HSQC and three-dimensional 15N-NOESY-HSQC). Mixing times for the NOESY experiments used for extraction of structural constraints were 100 ms. A doubly labeled sample (15N, 13C) of the shorter construct (531-574) was used to record triple (HNCA, HN(CO)CA, and CBCA(CO)NH) and double resonance experiments (HCCH-COSY and 13C-NOESY-HSQC). NMR data were processed with nmrPipe (48Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

All structures having no distance restraint violation larger than 0.2 Å or no violation of dihedral angle constraints larger than 5° were accepted (90% of all calculated structures). Rna15 and Pti1 C-terminal domains were modeled from the atomic structure of the homologous CstF64 domain using the in silico mutagenesis tools of the program MOLMOL (54Koradi R. Billeter M.

FTY-720, an immunosuppressive prodrug presently in phase 3 clinical trials, has attracted a lot of interest due to its effective inhibition of kidney transplant rejection and attenuation of autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (6Brinkmann V.

In vivo, FTY-720 becomes phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase type 2, and FTY-720-P is a high affinity ligand of all EDG family S1P receptors with the exception of S1P2 (19Mandala S. Hajdu R. Bergstrom J. Quackenbush E. Xie J. Milligan J. Thornton R. Shei G. Card D. Keohane C. Rosenbach M. Hale J. Lynch C.L. Rupprecht K. Parsons W. Rosen H.

J. 2001; 355: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), activates an inwardly rectifying K+ conductance through the activation of the S1P3 receptor, which in turn elicits unwanted bradycardia (22Sanna M.G. Liao J. Jo E. Alfonso C. Ahn M.Y. Peterson M.S. Webb B. Lefebvre S. Chun J. Gray N. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13839-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressive effects of FTY-720-P are mediated by the S1P1 receptor (23Cinamon G. Matloubian M. Lesneski M.J. Xu Y. Low C. Lu T. Proia R.L. Cyster J.G. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). FTY-720-P is an agonist of S1P1 and causes a long lasting desensitization of this receptor subtype, which appears to be the mechanism responsible for the inhibition of lymphocyte egress from the secondary lymphoid organs and the lymphopenia and the sequestration and eventual death of T lymphocytes (24Graeler M. Goetzl E.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 25Graeler M.H. Kong Y. Karliner J.S. Goetzl E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27737-27741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, S1P1-selective antagonists or functional antagonists would probably be devoid of cardiac side effects and retain the immunosuppressive effect. Given the simple and highly flexible structure of S1P and its high similarity to LPA combined with the high degree of homology in the EDG receptor family, identification of novel nonlipid drug candidates with FTY-720-P-like effects is a fundamental challenge in the field. Development of receptor subtype-selective pharmacophores could aid rational drug design and lead optimization as well as identification of novel molecular scaffolds through in silico searches of large chemical libraries. However, the lack of crystal structures of GPCR sets serious limitations on this effort. Our groups have embarked on a computational modeling-driven mutagenesis approach to delineate agonist recognition by S1P1 at the atomic level. This effort has enabled us to identify S1P receptor residues that make essential interactions with the charged phosphate and amino moieties of the S1P pharmacophore. We have identified three basic amino acids, Arg-3.28, Lys-5.38, and Arg-7.34 in S1P1 and S1P4 that form salt bridges with the phosphate group of S1P and are essential for ligand binding in one or both receptors (26Parrill A.L. Wang D. Bautista D.L. Van Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z. Fischer D.J. Baker D.L. Liliom K. Spiegel S. Tigyi G. J. Biol.

J. 2005; 389: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have pinpointed position 3.29, conserved as glutamine in LPA- and glutamate in S1P-specific members of the EDG family, as the single locus that determines ligand specificity for S1P versus LPA through required ion pairing between glutamate and the ammonium moiety of S1P (28Wang D.A. Lorincz Z. Bautista D.L. Liliom K. Tigyi G. Parrill A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49213-49220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The Gln/Asn-3.29 residue also plays an essential role in ligand binding, because substitution to alanine results in a loss of S1P and LPA binding and receptor activation. We also succeeded in elucidating differences between S1P1 and S1P4, as in the latter subtype Lys-5.38 and Trp-4.64 together compensate for the lack of a cationic residue at position 7.34 as in S1P1 (27Inagaki Y. Pham T.T. Fujiwara Y. Kohno T. Osborne D.A. Igarashi Y. Tigyi G. Parrill A.L. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These polar head group interactions are essential for ligand binding, activation, and specificity. However, the hydrophobic tail constituting the bulk of S1P has not been assigned a function, and its interaction with the ligand binding pocket has not been elucidated. In the present study, we set out to identify the residues of S1P1 that interact with the aliphatic part of S1P, which we designate the hydrophobic binding pocket of the receptor. In this context, we examined the role of these hydrophobic interactions in ligand binding and receptor activation. Starting with our previously published S1P1-S1P complex, we hypothesized that 15 residues line the hydrophobic binding pocket. Combined characterization of mutations at these 15 positions and work done in parallel on S1P4 revealed that the orientation of transmembrane helix 5 (TM5) was incorrect in the original model. We developed a new S1P1 model that predicted an additional six residues in TM5 constituting the hydrophobic binding pocket and resolved the apparent inconsistencies between our experimental findings and the original S1P1 model (supplemental Fig. 1). The new theoretical model predicts that the hydrophobic tail of S1P interacts with 20 residues in TM3, TM5, and TM6. We evaluated the impact of mutations that changed the size and/or electrostatic properties of these residues on ligand activation and binding. Among these mutants, we found six mutations that showed no or greatly reduced ligand-dependent activation yet maintained [32P]S1P binding similar to the wild type (WT) S1P1. The lack of activation in the presence of ligand binding suggests that these residues play an important role in the conformational transition of S1P1 to its activated state. The theoretical model was used as the basis for in silico screening of the NCI, National Institutes of Health, Developmental Therapeutics Database library for novel scaffolds that might produce selective ligands of the S1P1 receptor using the Enhanced NCI Database Browser. Two novel nonlipid lead compounds were experimentally confirmed as partial agonists of S1P1. Additionally, comparison of residues at analogous positions in other S1P receptors suggests modifications that will lead to selective agonists of each receptor. All reagents were of analytical purity obtained from Sigma unless specified otherwise. S1P was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). SEW2871 (Fig. 1) was a generous gift from Dr. Hugh Rosen (Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA). Amino acids in the TM domains of S1P1 can be assigned index positions to facilitate comparison between GPCRs with different numbers of amino acids, as described by Ballesteros and Weinstein (29Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Conn P.M. Sealfon S.C. Methods in Neurosciences. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 366-428Google Scholar). An index position is in the format x.xx. The first number denotes the TM domain in which the residue appears. The second number indicates the position of that residue relative to the most highly conserved residue in that TM domain, which is arbitrarily assigned position 50. E3.29, then, indicates the relative position of this glutamate in TM3 relative to the highly conserved arginine 3.50 in the (E/D)RY motif (29Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Conn P.M. Sealfon S.C. Methods in Neurosciences. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1995: 366-428Google Scholar). S1P1—A model of human S1P1 (GenBank™ accession number AFP23365) was developed by homology to a model of rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank entry 1boj) in a manner described in our previous publications (26Parrill A.L.

Briefly, the rhodopsin model was used to generate TM1–TM6, whereas the structure for the seventh TM was based on TM7 of the dopamine D2 receptor model (31Konvicka K. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The preliminary model was further refined by converting all cis amide bonds to the trans configuration and by manually rotating side chains at polarity-conserved positions to optimize hydrogen bonding between TMs. The AMBER94 force field (32Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M.J. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem.

A corrected model was constructed using the previous model as the template with a manual realignment of TM5 to move each residue back one position in the alignment. The corrected model was refined and minimized using the same protocol. S1P1 Single/Double Point Mutants—Mutant models of S1P1 were developed by homology to the corrected S1P1 model. Using the MOE software package, the appropriate mutation was constructed by side chain replacement. Nonpolar hydrogen atoms were added to the mutated amino acid side chain, and the model was subsequently geometry-optimized. The AMBER94 force field (32Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R.

A computational model of S1P was built using the MOE software package. The phosphate group was modeled with a net –1 charge, and the amine moiety was modeled with a net +1 charge. S1P was geometry-optimized using the MMFF94 force field (33Halgren T.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1996; 17: 490-519Crossref Scopus (4331) Google Scholar). Using the AUTODOCK 3.0 software package (34Morris G.M.

Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9210) Google Scholar), S1P was docked into S1P1 and the S1P1 mutant receptor models, and these complexes were evaluated based on final docked energy as well as visual analysis of electrostatic and other nonbonded interactions between the ligand and receptor. Docking parameters were set to default values with the exception of the number of energy evaluations (2.5 × 109), number of generations (30,000), local search iterations (3000), and number of runs (15Olivera A.

The complexes exhibiting the best interactions based on either final docked energy or visual analysis were geometry-optimized using the MMFF94 force field (33Halgren T.A. J. Comp.

SEW2871 was docked into the S1P1 receptor model using the same parameters and evaluation criteria. The docked positions of S1P and SEW2871 in the S1P1 receptor model were superposed and used to derive pharmacophore features sharing common location in both structures. Distances between these common pharmacophore features comprise the pharmacophore. The pharmacophore was used to search the Enhanced NCI Database Browser (available on the World Wide Web at 129.43.27.140/ncidb2/) for novel lead compounds. A trifluoromethylphenyl group was used for the anionic bioisostere, and carbon atoms were used to represent the hydrophobic functionality at other pharmacophore points. Hits from the search were evaluated based on their superposition onto the S1P and SEW2871 conformations from the S1P1 complexes. Hits were categorized as good, marginal, or negative based on these superpositions. Hits were considered negative if they exceeded the volume occupied by S1P or SEW2871 due to likely steric interactions with receptor atoms. The N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged S1P1 receptor construct (GenBank™ accession number AF233365) was provided by Dr. Timothy Hla. Site-specific mutations were generated using the ExSite™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (26Parrill A.L. Wang D. Bautista D.L. Van Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z.

Cell surface expression of the FLAG-tagged S1P1 and its mutants was determined by flow cytometry (FACS) as described previously (27Inagaki Y. Pham T.T. Fujiwara Y. Kohno T. Osborne D.A. Igarashi Y. Tigyi G. Parrill A.L. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transfected RH7777 cells were harvested by trypsinization, and upon harvesting, the cells were maintained at 4 °C for the subsequent steps. The cells were washed with ice-cold FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)). After washing once with FACS buffer, the cells were incubated for 30 min in blocking solution (5% BSA and 5% donkey serum (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4). The cells were washed once with FACS buffer, and the cells were subsequently incubated for 60 min in FACS buffer with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) (1:200). After washing the cells twice with FACS buffer, the cells were incubated for 30 min in FACS buffer with the Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) (1:1600). After washing the cells twice, samples were resuspended in 1% BSA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and analyzed using an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed with the Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). The S1P binding assays were done essentially as previously described (28Wang D.A. Lorincz Z. Bautista D.L. Liliom K. Tigyi G.

Transfected HEK293 cells (5 × 105) were incubated at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) binding buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm NaF, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 0.2 mg/ml essentially fatty acid-free BSA with 1 nm [32P]S1P in 50 nm S1P for 40 min. Cells were centrifuged and washed twice in binding buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in 2:1 CHCl3/MeOH, and the suspension was equilibrated in scintillation fluid overnight. Cell-bound radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting using a Beckman LS5000 TA counter (Beckman Coulter, Irvine, CA). Specific binding was defined as the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding (in the presence of 2–5 μm cold S1P). S.E. values were computed on the basis of triplicate samples from two transfections. For the competition assays, HEK293 cells were used. Briefly, 4 × 105 cells were plated in 24-well dishes and allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were then transfected with 0.4 μg of the cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and the transfection proceeded for 48 h. After washing the cells twice with ice-cold binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl), 0.1 nm [32P]S1P and competing concentrations of cold S1P (1 nm-10 μm), resuspended in binding buffer plus 4% BSA, were applied to the cells and incubated on ice for 30 min. After washing the cells twice with ice-cold binding buffer plus 0.4% BSA, the cells were lysed with 0.5% SDS and equilibrated in scintillation fluid. The triplicate samples were measured. The KD and Bmax values were determined using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). Receptor functional assays were performed as previously described (28Wang D.A. Lorincz Z. Bautista D.L. Liliom K.

The significance of differences was determined by one-way analysis of variance, Bonferroni post hoc test, using Prism statistical software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Values were considered significantly different at p < 0.05. Mutagenesis Strategy—The previously reported computationally modeled complex of S1P in S1P1 features 15 previously unexplored amino acid residues in TM3, TM4, and TM6 with atoms within 4.5 Å of S1P. In the present study, we pursued a three-pronged replacement strategy of these residues. First, we introduced property-conserving mutations of these residues that either reduced or increased size. The logic behind this approach was to probe the impact of increased or relaxed steric constraints in the hydrophobic binding pocket on ligand-induced activation. In addition, we replaced many of these residues with charged amino acids of similar size to probe whether disruption to hydrophobicity in the putative binding pocket would have an impact on receptor function. Third, in a few cases, we replaced charged residues with noncharged residues of similar size to test the effect of polar interactions between the ligand and the receptor. Theoretical Model of the S1P1-S1P Complex; Revisions of the Previous Model—Discrepancies between model-derived predictions and experimental observations in this and a previous study on S1P4 (27Inagaki Y.

J. 2005; 389: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) involved residues localized at the extracellular end of TM5. The differences we found were not consistent with proposed structural differences between active and inactive GPCR conformations; thus, they were probably an error in our previous S1P1 model (26Parrill A.L. Wang D. Bautista D.L. Van Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z. Fischer D.J. Baker D.L. Liliom K. Spiegel S. Tigyi G. J. Biol.

A corrected model of S1P1 was built based on an alternative alignment of TM5 derived from the recently validated S1P4 model (27Inagaki Y. Pham T.T. Fujiwara Y. Kohno T. Osborne D.A. Igarashi Y. Tigyi G. Parrill A.L. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As depicted in supplemental Fig. 1, the corrected model demonstrates that eight residues in TM5 have atoms within 4.5 Å of S1P. One of these residues, Lys-5.38, forms an ion pair with the phosphate group of S1P. This polar interaction was not identified in previous validation of the S1P1 model due to the incorrect positioning of amino acid residues at the top of TM5. Cell Surface Expression of S1P1 Mutants—In order to verify that the WT and mutant constructs were expressed at comparable levels, membrane fractions were prepared and analyzed for expression by Western blot analysis using the N-terminal FLAG epitope present in the constructs (supplemental Fig. 2). The levels of expression on the membrane fractions were comparable with that of the WT receptor with the exception of L3.43E/L3.44E, L6.41G, F5.48Y, F6.44G, and W6.48E. FACS analysis was used to determine if cell surface expression of the N-terminal FLAG epitope was similar for the mutant constructs to that of the WT (Table 1). The WT and the mutant constructs, with the exception of V5.47T and L6.41G, were expressed at the cell surface in similar levels based on immunolabeling for the FLAG epitope. However, the V5.47L and L6.41E mutants were expressed and included in the pharmacological testing. The cell surface expression of L3.43E/L3.44E, F5.48Y, F6.44G, and W6.48E were comparable with that of the WT receptor.TABLE 1Cell surface expression of WT S1P1 and S1P1 mutants with abolished S1P-induced activation in RH7777 cells determined by flow cytometryConstructAnti-FLAG-stained cells%Vector2.5WT23.0M3.32K19.3L3.36E15.2L3.43E/L3.44E10.3L3.43G/L3.44G14.715.41A24.2C5.44D16.0V5.47L22.3V5.47T0.6F5.48G22.1F5.48Y22.1L5.51E17.4L5.52A14.1V6.40L19.6L6.41G5.6F6.44G17.2W6.48A12.6W6.48E23.4 Open table in a new tab The Effects of Mutations of Residues Lining Predicted Hydrophobic Binding Pocket on Ligand-induced Activation of S1P1—In the first round of pharmacological testing, we evaluated the impact of all amino acid replacements on the EC50 and maximal activation (Emax) elicited by S1P.

In the ascidian Styela plicata (Chordata-Tunicata), a heparin composed mainly by the disaccharide α-l-iduronic acid 2-sulfate-1→4β-d-GlcN(SO4)(6SO4), with a minor contribution (∼25%) of the disaccharide α-l-iduronic acid-1→4β-d-GlcN(SO4)(6SO4) was detected in intracellular granules of accessory cells, named test cells, that reside in the periviteline space of oocytes (28Cavalcante M.C.

Because of the morphological and biochemical similarities between ascidian test cells and mammalian mast cells, we have hypothesized that these cells could be evolutively related.

Some of these cells migrate from hemolymph to tissues, where they carry out several immunologic actions, such as phagocytosis of self and non-self molecules, expression of cytotoxic agents, encapsulation of antigens, and also reparation of damaged tissues (35Hirose E. Zoolog. Sci. 2003; 20: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the ascidian S. plicata, the hemocytes have been classified by light microscopy by Radford et al. (32Radford J.L. Hutchinson A.E. Burandt M. Raftos D.A. Acta Zool. 1998; 79: 44-49Google Scholar). The authors described eight individual cell types: hemoblast, lymphocyte-like cell, signet ring cell, refractile vacuolated cell, nonrefractile vacuolated cell, pigment cell, fried egg cell, and fine granular cell. As mentioned earlier, in evolved chordates, intracellular GAGs are restricted to immunologic cells that either reside in the tissues (mast cells) or circulate in the blood (basophils) (15Wedemeyer J. Tsai M. Galli S.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Considering the phylogenetic position of ascidians and taking into account that a heparin-containing cell, similar to a mammalian mast cell, was detected in the tissues of S. plicata, it is possible that a basophil-like cell containing intracellular GAGs circulates in the hemolymph of this invertebrate chordate. To investigate this hypothesis, we submitted the hemolymph of S. plicata to proteolytic digestion before and after separation of plasma and hemocytes and analyzed the extracted and purified sulfated glycans. In addition, ultrastructural and immunocytochemical studies were carried out to characterize and determine which hemocytes express these glycans. Our results reveal the occurrence of two sulfated glycans in the hemolymph of this ascidian: heparin, which is present in intracellular granules of a circulating basophil-like cell, and a sulfated galactoglucan, which occurs free in the plasma. These results show for the first time the presence of heparin in a circulating basophil-like cell in an invertebrate chordate and may contribute toward the understanding of the evolution of the immune system in this phylum.

Unlabeled telemethylhistamine (Sigma) was diluted in 1 mm acetic acid and stored at 4 °C. Chloroform (Merck) was used fresh for the organic extraction procedure. Adult individuals of S. plicata were collected at Praia da Urca (Guanabara Bay), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and maintained in an aerated aquarium containing filtered sea water at 20 °C until use.

After harvesting, the hemocytes were separated from plasma by centrifugation (130 × g for 10 min at room temperature). The hemocytes were immersed in acetone and kept for 24 h at 4 °C. The dried hemocytes (1 g) were suspended in 20 ml of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), containing 100 mg of papain, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm cysteine and incubated at 60 °C for 24 h. The incubation mixture was then centrifuged (2000 × g for 10 min at room temperature), the supernatant was separated, and the precipitate was incubated with papain two more times, as described above. The clear supernatants from the three extractions were combined, and the polysaccharides were precipitated with 2 volumes of 95% ethanol and maintained at 4 °C for 24 h. The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation (2000 × g for 10 min at room temperature) and freeze-dried. For the extraction of the plasma polysaccharides, after the removal of the hemocytes, the plasma was dialyzed against distilled water, lyophilized, and incubated with papain, as described above. The glycans obtained from plasma (∼8 mg) were applied to a Q Sepharose-FPLC column, equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The glycans were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–2.0 m NaCl (150 ml) at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. Fractions of 1.5 ml were collected and checked by a metachromatic assay using 1,9-dimethyl-methylene blue (39Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2902) Google Scholar). Fractions eluted with different NaCl concentrations were pooled as indicated in Fig. 2A, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. The glycans (∼2 mg) obtained from hemocytes or porcine heparin (∼1 mg) were applied to a Mono Q-FPLC column, equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The glycans were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–2.0 m NaCl (45 ml) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and checked by metachromatic assay using 1,9-dimethyl-methylene blue. Fractions eluted with different NaCl concentrations were pooled as indicated in Fig. 4A, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. Agarose Gel—The crude or purified glycans from plasma (∼10 μg dry weight) or hemocytes (1.5 μg as uronic acid), before or after incubation with specific GAG lyases or deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, as described previously (40Dietrich C.P. Dietrich S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, the glycans and a mixture of standard GAGs, containing chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate (1.5 μg as uronic acid of each), were applied to a 0.5% agarose gel in 0.05 m 1,3-diaminopropane/acetate (pH 9.0) and run for 1 h at 110 mV. After electrophoresis, the glycans were fixed with aqueous 0.1% cetylmethylammonium bromide solution and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in acetic acid/ethanol/water (0.1:5:5, v/v/v). Polyacrylamide Gel—The molecular masses of the purified glycans from plasma and hemocytes were estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Samples (∼10 μg) were applied to a 1-mm-thick 6% polyacrylamide slab gel, and after electrophoresis at 100 V for ∼1 h in 0.06 m sodium barbital (pH 8.6), the gel was stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in 1% acetic acid. After staining, the gel was washed overnight in 1% acetic acid. The molecular mass markers used were dextran 500 (average Mr 500,000), chondroitin 6-sulfate from shark cartilage (average Mr 60,000), chondroitin 4-sulfate from whale cartilage (average Mr 40,000), porcine intestinal mucosa heparin (average Mr 18,000), and dextran 8 (average Mr 8,000). CTA-SAX Chromatography of Heparin Digests—To prepare the digests, exhaustive digestion of heparin (0.1 mg) was performed at room temperature for 48 h with a mixture of 2.5 mIU of heparinase I, 2.5 mIU of heparinase II, and 2.5 mIU of heparinase III in a total volume of 30 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm Ca(OAc)2 and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The columns used for the chromatography of the heparin digests were dynamically coated with CTA, as described earlier (41Mourier P. Viskov C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 332: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The eluting salt was ammonium methane sulfonate, prepared by neutralization until pH 2.5 of methane sulfonic acid by aqueous ammonia solutions. The solvent B of CTA-SAX was 2 m ammonium methane sulfonate at pH 2.5. The solvent A was water (quality Milli-Q) brought to pH 3 by the addition of methane sulfonic acid. A linear gradient starting from 1% B to 100% B within 74 min was used at a flow rate of 0.22 ml/min. After 74 min, the percentage of B remained at 100%. After each run, a reconditioning step of 18 min was used. Column temperature was 40 °C. Chondroitin Lyases—The ascidian glycans (∼100 μg) were incubated with 0.01 units of chondroitin AC or ABC lyase in 0.1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing 5 mm EDTA and 15 mm sodium acetate. After incubation at 37 °C for 12 h, another 0.01 units of enzyme was added to the mixture, and the reaction continued for an additional 12-h period. Heparan Sulfate and Heparin Lyases—About 50 μg (as dry weight of each) of the glycans extracted from the ascidian tissues were incubated with 0.005 units of either heparan sulfate lyase or heparin lyase in 100 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0), containing 10 mm calcium acetate for 17 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, the mixtures were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, as described earlier. Hexuronic Acid—The hexuronic acid content of the glycans from the various tissues was estimated by the carbazole reaction (42Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5202) Google Scholar). Deaminative Cleavage with Nitrous Acid—Deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid of the sulfated glycans was performed as described by Shievely and Conrad (43Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Chemical Analyses—Total hexose was measured by the phenol-sulfuric acid method of DuBois et al. (44Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-354Crossref Scopus (40807) Google Scholar). After acid hydrolysis (6.0 n trifluoroacetic acid, 100 °C for 5 h), total sulfate was determined by the BaCl2-gelatin method (45Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proportions of the different hexoses in the acid hydrolysates were determined by paper chromatography in butanol/piridine/water (3:2:1, v/v/v) for 36 h or in isobutyric acid, 1.0 NH4OH (5:3, v/v). The sugars were detected on the chromatogram by silver nitrate staining. NMR Spectroscopy—1H spectra were recorded using a Bruker DRX 600 with a triple resonance probe. About 3 mg of the purified plasma polysaccharide was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 99.9% D2O (CIL). All spectra were recorded at 60 °C with hydrogen oxygen deuterium suppression by presaturation. The correlation spectroscopy (COSY) spectrum was recorded using states-TPPI (states-time proportion phase incrementation) for quadrature detection in the indirect dimension. All chemical shifts were relative to external trimethylsilyl-propionic acid for 1H. Antithrombin III Affinity Chromatography—The polysaccharide (10 mg) was chromatographed on an ATIII-Sepharose column (15 × 2.6 cm). The column was prepared by bounding 100 mg of human ATIII (Hyphen Biomed) on cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma). The polysaccharide fraction was eluted by NaCl solution. The low affinity fraction was eluted out of the column at 0.25 m NaCl solution buffered at pH 7.4 with Tris (10 mm) and desalted on Sephadex G10. The high affinity fraction was eluted with 3 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris and desalted on Sephadex G10. Inhibition of Thrombin by Antithrombin in the Presence of Mammalian or Hemocyte Heparins—These effects were evaluated by the assay of amydolytic activity of thrombin, using chromogenic substrate, as described (28Cavalcante M.C. Allodi S. Valente A.P. Straus A.H. Takahashi H.K. Mourão P.A. Pavão M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36189-36196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Incubations were performed in disposable UV semimicrocuvettes. The final concentrations of reactants included 50 nm antithrombin, 15 nm thrombin, and 0–10 μg/ml heparin in 100 μl of 0.02 m Tris/HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1.0 mg/ml polyethylene glycol (pH 7.4) (TS/PEG buffer). Thrombin was added last to initiate the reaction. After a 60-s incubation at room temperature, 500 μl of 100 μm chromogenic substrate Chromogenix TH in TS/PEG buffer was added, and the absorbance at 405 nm was recorded for 100 s. The rate of change of absorbance was proportional to the thrombin activity remaining in the incubation. No inhibition occurred in control experiments in which thrombin was incubated with antithrombin in the absence of heparin; nor did inhibition occur when thrombin was incubated with heparin alone over the range of concentrations tested. Conventional Transmission Electron Microscopy—The hemocytes were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde EM grade, 4% formaldehyde freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) under microwaves (Laboratory Microwaves Processor, Pelco model RFS59MP; 2.45 GHz) for 10 s twice at 45 °C and rinsed twice in cacodylate buffer for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) in a microwave oven for 10 s, dehydrated through a graded series of acetone, and embedded in epoxy resin Poly/Bed 812 (Polyscience, Inc.). Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were obtained (LKB ultramicrotome) and collected on copper grids (300 mesh). The sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 20 min and 1% lead citrate for 5 min. The samples were observed in a Zeiss 900 EM electron microscope, operated at 80 kV. Immunocytochemistry—Circulating hemocytes were slightly centrifuged from hemolymph and fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 4% 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (Sigma) at 4 °C. The samples were washed with 0.05% sodium borohydride in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), dehydrated in a graded series of methanol until 95%, and embedded in LR Gold acrylic resin at room temperature. Ultrathin sections (90 nm) were obtained and collected on nickel grids (300 mesh). The sections were hydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1%) for 10 min, and nonspecific sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in 1% PBS containing 50 mm ammonium chloride for 10 min. The samples were incubated overnight in a humid chamber with anti-heparin monoclonal antibody (46Straus A.H. Travassos L.R. Takahashi H.K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or anti-histamine polyclonal antibodies (Chemicon) diluted in 1% PBS. After washing with 1% PBS, the sections were incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit 10-nm gold-conjugated IgM antibody (Sigma) for 3 h and washed in 1% PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and finally with distilled water. The sections were stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 20 min. The controls were done omitting the incubation with the primary antibody. Histamine N-Methyltransferase Activity—Tissues of S. plicata (intestine, hemolymph, and pharynx) as well as a preparation of rat peritoneal mast cells were homogenized with PBS (1%, v/v), subjected to three consecutive cycles of freeze and thaw, and then centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were then stored at –20 °C until total protein and histamine quantification. Total protein content was spectrophotometrically quantified (540 nm) in the supernatant by means of the Biuret technique (47Fleury P. Eberhard R. Ann. Biol. Clin. 1951; 9: 453-466PubMed Google Scholar). Histamine content was estimated in the supernatant by the radioenzymatic technique of Snyder et al. (48Snyder S.H. Baldessarini R.J. Axelrod J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1966; 153: 544-549PubMed Google Scholar), modified by Côrrea and Saavedra (49Correa F.M.A. Saavedra J.M. Brain Res. 1981; 205: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay was carried out in a final volume of 60 μl, consisting of 10 μl of standard histamine solution or tissue extract and 50 μl of a freshly prepared mixture containing histamine N-methyltransferase preparation, 0.125 μCi of S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine, and 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.9. Measurements were made in duplicate, and the blanks were prepared by replacing the sample test with 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.9. After sample incubation overnight at 4 °C, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of 1 m NaOH containing 10 μl of the unlabeled methylhistamine carrier. The [3H]methylhistamine formed was then extracted into 3 ml of chloroform. After evaporation of the organic phase, the radioactivity was counted with a Beckman LS-100 Scintilograph. The Hemolymph of S. plicata Contains Different Sulfated Polysaccharides—Ascidian hemolymph contains different types of cells, named hemocytes, embedded in liquid plasma. In order to investigate the presence of sulfated polysaccharides, the hemolymph was subjected to proteolytic treatment with papain, and the extracted material was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Two main metachromatic bands with different electrophoretic motilities, corresponding to two different sulfated polysaccharides, were observed in the gel. The low mobility band possesses the same migration as standard heparan sulfate, whereas the band with the higher electrophoretic mobility migrates as standard chondroitin sulfate. To investigate the origin of these sulfated polysaccharides, the hemolymph was separated into plasma and hemocytes by centrifugation, and the glycans were extracted separately by protease digestion and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1, the sulfated polysaccharides from the hemolymph have different origins. The material migrating as chondroitin sulfate originates"
https://openalex.org/W1992727501,"Two homologous apoA-I mimetic peptides, 3F-2 and 3F14, differ in their in vitro antiatherogenic properties (Epand, R. M., Epand, R. F., Sayer, B. G., Datta, G., Chaddha, M., and Anantharamaiah, G. M. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 51404-51414). In the present work, we demonstrate that the peptide 3F-2, which has more potent anti-inflammatory activity in vitro when administered intraperitoneally to female apoE null mice (20 μg/mouse/day) for 6 weeks, inhibits atherosclerosis (lesion area 15,800 ± 1000 μm2, n = 29), whereas 3F14 does not (lesion area 20,400 ± 1000 μm2, n = 26) compared with control saline administered (19,900 ± 1400 μm2, n = 22). Plasma distribution of the peptides differs in that 3F-2 preferentially associates with high density lipoprotein, whereas 3F14 preferentially associates with apoB-containing particles. After intraperitoneal injection of 14C-labeled peptides, 3F14 reaches a higher maximal concentration and has a longer half-time of elimination than 3F-2. A study of the effect of these peptides on the motional and organizational properties of phospholipid bilayers, using several NMR methods, demonstrates that the two peptides insert to different extents into membranes. 3F-2 with aromatic residues at the center of the nonpolar face partitions closer to the phospholipid head group compared with 3F14. In contrast, only 3F14 affects the terminal methyl group of the acyl chain, decreasing the 2H order parameter and at the same time also decreasing the molecular motion of this methyl group. This dual effect of 3F14 can be explained in terms of the cross-sectional shape of the amphipathic helix. These results support the proposal that the molecular basis for the difference in the biological activities of the two peptides lies with their different interactions with membranes. Two homologous apoA-I mimetic peptides, 3F-2 and 3F14, differ in their in vitro antiatherogenic properties (Epand, R. M., Epand, R. F., Sayer, B. G., Datta, G., Chaddha, M., and Anantharamaiah, G. M.

In the present work, we demonstrate that the peptide 3F-2, which has more potent anti-inflammatory activity in vitro when administered intraperitoneally to female apoE null mice (20 μg/mouse/day) for 6 weeks, inhibits atherosclerosis (lesion area 15,800 ± 1000 μm2, n = 29), whereas 3F14 does not (lesion area 20,400 ± 1000 μm2, n = 26) compared with control saline administered (19,900 ± 1400 μm2, n = 22).

These results support the proposal that the molecular basis for the difference in the biological activities of the two peptides lies with their different interactions with membranes. ApoA-I mimetic peptides are increasingly considered as potential effective treatments for atherosclerosis and related inflammatory disorders (1Meyers C.D. Kashyap M.L. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 2005; 20: 307-312PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ballantyne C.M. Nambi V. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2004; 44: 1436-1438PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shah P.K. Chyu K.Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2005; 15: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); therefore, knowledge of the molecular basis of their modulation of membrane properties is important for an understanding of their mechanism of action. Several studies have shown that peptides capable of enhancing the protective effects of HDL 3The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; 3F-2, Ac-DKWKAVYDKFAEAFKEFL-NH2;3F14, Ac-DWLKAFYDKVAEKFKEAF-NH2; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine; CSA, chemical shift anisotropy; SSB, spinning side bands; PON, paraoxonase; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; FID, free induction decay; DMPC, dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine; MAS, magic angle spinning. against inflammation also inhibit atherosclerosis (4Van Lenten B.J. Wagner A.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Fishbein M.C. Adhikary L. Nayak D.P. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Not all HDL populations exhibit similar biological activities (5Navab M. Ananthramaiah G.M. Reddy S.T. Van Lenten B.J. Ansell B.J. Hama S. Hough G. Bachini E. Grijalva V.R. Wagner A.C. Shaposhnik Z. Fogelman A.M. Ann. Med. 2005; 37: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The protective effect of HDL against atherosclerosis is not only dependent on a higher concentration of HDL in the blood but is also dependent on the molecular composition of the HDL. Curiously, another major protein of HDL, the apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II), which also possesses a structural motif related to apoA-I, has proinflammatory activity, and transgenic mice expressing human apoA-II develop atherosclerosis (6Castellani L.W. Navab M. Van Lenten B.J. Hedrick C.C. Hama S.Y. Goto A.M. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 464-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), This is in contrast to transgenic mice expressing human apoA-I, which are resistant to atherosclerosis (6Castellani L.W. Navab M. Van Lenten B.J. Hedrick C.C. Hama S.Y. Goto A.M. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 464-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Whereas apoA-I is easily exchangeable, apoA-II can displace apoA-I, indicating higher lipid affinity and nonexchangeability of this apolipoprotein (7Chung J. Abano D.A. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7456-7464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the antioxidant enzyme paraoxanase is able to associate with apoA-I-alone-containing particles and not with apoA-II-containing particles, indicating a possible reason for increased antiatherogenicity of apoA-I-alone-containing particles (8Gaidukov L. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11843-11854Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 9Blatter Garin M.C. Moren X. James R.W. J.

When the apoA-I mimetic peptide D-4F is administered to mice that possess inflammatory HDL, the HDL is converted to a form that has inhibitory activity against LDL-induced monocyte chemotaxis (11Navab M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Reddy S.T. Hama S. Hough G. Grijalva V.R. Yu N. Ansell B.J. Datta G. Garber D.W. Fogelman A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We have shown that in class A amphipathic helical peptides possessing the same polar face with identical charged residue distribution, subtle differences in the arrangement of the hydrophobic residues result in only subtle differences in physical properties and interaction with lipids but result in large differences in biological properties (12Datta G. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Chaddha M. Kirksey M.A. Garber D.W. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol.

This is perhaps analogous to the differences between apolipoproteins A-I and A-II. These observations prompted the present investigations to understand molecular properties of a pair of class A amphipathic helical peptides with opposing ability to inhibit LDL-induced monocyte chemotaxis in the coculture system. The apoA-I mimetic peptides we have studied contain only 18 amino acid residues, compared with the 243 residues of apoA-I. Despite their small size, some of these peptides are as potent as apoA-I in solubilizing lipid, inhibiting hemolysis caused by lytic peptides, inhibiting oxidized phospholipid-induced monocyte chemotaxis, scavenging lipid hydroperoxides from LDL (12Datta G. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Chaddha M. Kirksey M.A. Garber D.W. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol.

Ou J. Ackerman A.W. Oldham K.T. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1520-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Studies using these peptide analogs clearly show that in vitro anti-inflammatory activities are sensitive to the arrangement of residues on the hydrophobic face of the helix (12Datta G. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Chaddha M. Kirksey M.A. Garber D.W. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol.

Although the anti-inflammatory activities of this series of model class A amphipathic helical peptides are severalfold different, both active and inactive analogs share many of the same physical properties. They are similar in conformation, as shown by CD in both the presence and absence of lipid (12Datta G. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Chaddha M. Kirksey M.A. Garber D.W. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Hama S.

Fluorescence studies of the Trp emission suggest that the peptides bind phospholipids to a similar extent (12Datta G. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Chaddha M. Kirksey M.A. Garber D.W. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol.

HPLC retention times and monolayer exclusion pressures indicated that there is no direct correlation of peptide function with lipid affinity. We hypothesize that the difference in anti-inflammatory activities among these peptides is a result of rather subtle differences in the penetration of the peptide into lipid. It appears that the requirements for anti-inflammatory activity are not based on a specific structure or interaction, since the peptides 3F-1, 3F-2, and 4F all are able to inhibit LDL-induced monocyte chemotaxis despite differences in their sequences (12Datta G. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Chaddha M. Kirksey M.A. Garber D.W. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, even some peptides derived from the sequence of apoJ also have anti-inflammatory properties, although they have very different sequences (15Navab M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Reddy S.T.

The present study demonstrates that one of the 3F peptides, 3F-2, which was able to inhibit LDL-induced monocyte chemotaxis (12Datta G. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Chaddha M. Kirksey M.A. Garber D.W.

Using NMR, we further show that these differences in the inhibition of lesion formation are related to differences in the perturbation of lipid bilayers by these peptides. These observations are related to differences in the modulation of HDL properties in vivo by these two peptides. Materials—Cholesterol and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Specifically deuterated forms of oleic acid were purchased from C/D/N Isotopes, Inc. (Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada). These labeled fatty acids were incorporated into POPC by chemical synthesis by Avanti Polar Lipids. The two forms of deutero-oleoyl POPC were >99% pure with about 5% acyl migration. Peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method with a Protein Technologies PS-3 automatic peptide synthesizer using the procedures described previously (13Datta G. Chaddha M. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Garber D.W. Mishra V.K. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J.

Peptides were purified using a preparative HPLC system (Beckman Gold), and the purity of the peptides was ascertained by mass spectral analysis and analytical HPLC. For obtaining 14C-labeled peptides, during the last step of the synthesis, 14C-labeled acetic acid (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. St Louis, MO) was used to acetylate the peptide instead of normal acetic acid. Animals—Female apoE null mice on a C57BL/6J background were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained on a chow diet (Ralston Purina). The University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal studies. Peptide Administration and Lesion Quantitation—Peptides 3F-2 and 3F14 were solubilized in physiological saline, and concentration was determined using A280 as described earlier (12Datta G. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Chaddha M. Kirksey M.A. Garber D.W. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol.

Two experimental groups received 20 μg/mouse/day peptide solutions administered intraperitoneally daily for 6 weeks, including weekends and holidays. The control group received an equal volume of saline every day for 6 weeks. At the end of the study, blood samples were taken under anesthesia by retro-orbital bleeding, and hearts were excised and subjected to histological examination and quantification of lesion area as described earlier (16Garber D.W. Datta G. Chaddha M. Palgunachari M.N. Hama S.Y. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 545-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide-mediated Modulation of Lipoprotein Properties—Plasma distributions of 14C-labeled peptides 3F-2 and 3F14 were determined by mixing peptides with plasma from apoE null mice (5 μg of peptide/ml of plasma), incubating at 37 °C for 15 min, and then separating plasma lipoproteins using the CLiP procedure as described earlier (19Garber D.W. Kulkarni K.R. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1020-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were collected, and radioactivity in each lipoprotein fraction was determined. Similar separations were done using 14C-labeled peptide-DMPC complexes (1:1 (w/w); 5 μg of peptide/ml of plasma). For determination of changes in HDL subspecies, 20 μg of peptides were administered to female apoE null mice. Plasma was collected 5 h after peptide administration by retro-orbital bleeding. 3.5 μl of plasma was subjected to agarose electrophoresis in one dimension and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension using the method described by us previously (20Handwerger S. Datta G. Richardson B. Schmidt C.M. Siddiqi T. Turzai L. Anantharamaiah G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E384-E389PubMed Google Scholar). Western analysis for apoA-I using apoA-I antibody was performed as described previously (14Ou Z. Ou J. Ackerman A.W. Oldham K.T. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1520-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For determining the distribution of apoA-I after peptide administration, plasma samples were first subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis in duplicates, and one agarose gel in each group was transferred and subjected to Western blot with mouse apoA-I antibody. The other agarose gel was cut into 14 equal fractions, and the apoA-I-containing fractions (as determined by the Western blot) were boiled with equal amounts of 10% SDS to extract apoA-I in these bands. These were then subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis with isolated mouse apoA-I as a standard and subjected to Western blot with mouse apoA-I antibody as described earlier. The mouse apoA-I bands were quantified as relative intensity in arbitrary units and plotted to determine the differences in the comparative amounts of apoA-I in different lipoprotein fractions. Plasma Turnover of the Peptides—14C-Labeled peptides (20 μg/mouse) were administered to apoE null mice intraperitoneally, and the radioactivity in plasma was determined at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 min and at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h. Three samples were taken at each time point. No more than three plasma samples were taken from each animal, and time points for animals were staggered so that no two animals had identical time point assignments. Turnover parameters were calculated on all data points (rather than averages) by PKAnalyst software (MicroMath Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT) using a one-compartment model with first order input and first order output. In a separate experiment, 6-week-old female apoE null mice were treated with 3F-2, 3F14, or saline for 1 week (daily intraperitoneally; 20 μg/mouse/day). Lipid hydroperoxides were determined using a spectrophotometric assay (21Auerbach B.J. Kiely J.S. Cornicelli J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Paraoxonase activity was measured as described earlier (22Navab M. Anantharamaiah G.M. Reddy S.T. Hough G. Grijalva V.R. Wagner A.C. Frank J.S. Datta G. Garber D. Fogelman A.M. Circulation. 2004; 109: 120-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plateletactivating factor-acetylhydrolase activity was measured by using a fluorescent substrate (23Gowri M.S. Van der Westhuyzen D.R. Bridges S.R. Anderson J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2226-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Preparation of Samples for NMR Experiments—Lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). For samples containing peptide, an aliquot of a solution of the peptide in methanol was added to the lipid solution in chloroform/methanol. The solvent was then evaporated under a stream of nitrogen with constant rotation of a test tube so as to deposit a uniform film over the bottom one-third of the tube. The last traces of solvent were removed by placing the tube under high vacuum for several h. The lipid film was then hydrated with 20 mm PIPES, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl with 0.002% NaN3, made either at pH 7.4 in deuterium-depleted water (for 2H NMR) or in 2H2O adjusted to a pH meter reading of 7.0 (pD = 7.4) and suspended by intermittent vortexing. The samples were transferred to 45-μl Kel-F spherical inserts of an 18 × 4-mm ZrO2 rotor, attempting to pack the maximal amount of sample into the insert while maintaining it wet. The samples were then incubated 24 h at 4 °C to allow for equilibration. Assignment of Resonances for POPC—POPC was dissolved in 2HCCl3 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc.) to a concentration of ∼20 mg/ml. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to TMS using the residual solvent signals at 7.26 and 77.16 ppm as internal references for the 1H and 13C spectra, respectively. All spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 700-MHz NMR spectrometer. Proton spectra were acquired at 700.23 MHz using a 5-mm triple resonance inverse cryoprobe with z axis gradient capability. The spectra were obtained in 16 scans in 65,536 data points over a 5.297-kHz spectral width (6.187 s acquisition time). Sample temperature was maintained at 25 °C by a Bruker BVT 3000 digital variable temperature unit. A 1.5-s relaxation delay was used between acquisitions. The free induction decay (FID) was processed using Gaussian multiplication (line broadening, -2.0 Hz; Gaussian broadening, 0.1). The FID was also zero-filled to 131,072 before Fourier transformation. Proton COSY two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded in the absolute value mode using the pulse sequence 90°-t1-45°-acquire and included pulsed field gradients for coherence selection. The data were acquired in two scans for each of the 256 FIDs that contained 2,048 data points in the F2 dimension over a 5.297-kHz spectral width. The 1H 90° pulse width was 8.0 μs. A 1.2-s relaxation delay was used between acquisitions. Forward linear prediction to 512 data points and zero-filling in the F1 dimension produced a 1,024 × 1,024 data matrix with a digital resolution of 5.172 Hz/point in both dimensions. During two-dimensional Fourier transformation, a sine-bell squared window function was applied to both dimensions. The transformed data were then symmetrized. 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 176.07 MHz using the 5-mm triple resonance inverse cryoprobe with z axis gradient capability. The spectra were acquired using the J-modulated spin sort pulse sequence over a 42.373-kHz spectral width in 65,536 data points (0.773 s acquisition time). The 13C pulse width was 15.0 μs (90° flip angle). A relaxation delay of 1.0 s was used. The delay time in the J-modulated spin sort pulse sequence was set at 0.006896 s to produce an edited spectrum containing quaternary and methylene carbons with positive phase, whereas methine and methyl carbons appeared with negative phase. The FID was processed using exponential multiplication (line broadening, 4.0 Hz) and zero-filled to 131,072 before Fourier transformation. Inverse detected 1H-13C two-dimensional chemical shift correlation spectra were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the pulsed field gradient version of the HSQC pulse sequence. The FIDs in the F2 (1H) dimension were recorded over a 5.297-kHz spectral width in 2,048 data points. The 256 FIDs in the F1 (13C) dimension were obtained over a 29.499-kHz spectral width. Each FID was acquired in two scans. The fixed delays during the pulse sequence were a 1.2-s relaxation delay and 1.724-ms delay for polarization transfer. The 90° 1H pulse width was 8.0 μs, whereas the 13C 90° pulse width was 15.0 μs. The data were processed using a sine-bell squared window function shifted by π/2 in both dimensions. Forward linear prediction to 512 data points followed by zero-filling to 1024 data points was also performed in the F1 dimension. Inverse detected 1H-13C two-dimensional chemical shift correlation spectra through two- and three-bond coupling interactions were acquired in the absolute value mode using the pulsed field gradient version of the Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation pulse sequence. The FIDs in the F2 (1H) dimension were acquired over a 5.297-kHz spectral width in 2,048 data points. The 256 FIDs in the F1 (13C) dimension were recorded over a 29.499-kHz spectral width. Each FID was acquired in two scans. The fixed delays during the pulse sequence were a 1.2-s relaxation delay and an 80.0-ms delay to allow evolution of the long range couplings. The 90° 1H pulse width was 8.0 μs, whereas the 13C 90° pulse width was 15.0 μs. The data were processed using a sine-bell window function in both dimensions. Forward linear prediction to 512 data points followed by zero-filling to 1024 data points was also performed in the F1 dimension. 2H Static Powder Pattern—Deuterium powder pattern spectra at a frequency of 92.12 MHz were acquired using a fixed tuned deuterium high resolution (saddle coil) probe on a Bruker AVANCE 600 spectrometer. 100 μl of the suspension in a 5-mm Shigemi NMR tube was centered in the coil of the probe. The quadrupole echo sequence (90x-τ1-90y-τ2-acquire) was used with a 90° pulse length of 9 μs and a relaxation delay of 0.1 s. The value of τ1 was 50 μs, and that of τ2 was very short, so that the top of the echo could be manually found by 22 left shifts of the data. 4,096 data points were acquired with a sweep width of 303.03 kHz for an acquisition time of 0.00681 s. Once the top of the echo was set at the start of the data, the set was zero-filled to 8,192, an exponential multiplication corresponding to a line broadening of 100 Hz was applied, and the data were Fourier transformed and phased. Quadrupole coupling values were measured from the separation of the peaks in the powder pattern. MAS/NMR Measurements—The solid state NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer equipped with a standard bore 11.7-tesla magnet, giving a 500.12 MHz 1H base frequency. The spectrometer was equipped with a 4-mm broad band tunable MAS probe, and the spectra were recorded at ambient temperature. Magic angle spinning was controlled using a Bruker model H2620 pneumatic MAS controller. 13CT1 Measurements—The 13C NMR T1 times were determined using the saturation recovery method together with power-gated decoupling of the protons. The samples were spun at a rate of 5500 Hz. The spectra were recorded at a carbon resonance frequency of 125.77 MHz with a sweep width of 43 kHz, and the acquisition time was set to 0.5 s. Because the saturation recovery method permits rapid repetition, the recycle delay was set to 0.1 s. At least eight different variable delay times were chosen, and their order was randomized in order to eliminate any systematic errors. For each variable delay time, 4096 transients were co-added to give sufficient signal to noise. The raw data were zero-filled to 32,768 points, and exponential multiplication (broadening factor lb = 20 Hz) was applied. The integrated intensities of the peaks were plotted versus delay time, and an exponential fit of the data as per Equation 1 yielded the T1 results. i(t)=i(0)⋅(1−exp(−tT1)) (Eq. 1) SSB of 31P—The 31P NMR spectra were recorded at 202.45 MHz over a 25-kHz sweep width. Raw spectra were recorded using 16,384 data points (acquisition time less than 0.3 s), and the data were processed without zero filling and with exponential multiplication (lb = 50 Hz). At least three different MAS spinning speeds were used for each sample. The chemical shift anisotropies (CSAs) of the 31P NMR from the phospholipid samples were determined using the solid line shape analysis routine from version 1.3 of Bruker's Topspin program. This program calculates the CSA following the Herzfeld-Berger method (24Herzfeld J. Berger A.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1980; 73: 6021-6030Crossref Scopus (1568) Google Scholar). The CSAs were determined from the 31P NMR spectra recorded at at least three different spinning speeds, and the average result is reported. Effect of Peptide Administration on Plasma Cholesterol—In all of the three groups, there was no difference in the total plasma cholesterol values. Fractionation of plasma on two serially connected Superose 6 FPLC columns yielded essentially identical lipoprotein profiles (results not shown). Effect of Peptide Administration on Lesion Formation—Mean lesion cross-sectional areas are presented in Fig. 2. Mice administered peptide 3F-2 showed a significant decrease in lesion area compared with both the control group and the 3F14-administered group. However, administration of the peptide 3F14 did not show any difference compared with the control group (Fig. 2). Kinetics of Plasma Turnover of 14C-Radiolabeled Peptides—Administration of 14C-labeled 3F-2 and 3F14 was done in order to determine the bioavailability of peptides. The results are summarized in Table 1. The half-time of absorption of 3F-2 was somewhat faster than for 3F14, and the maximal concentration of 3F14 was higher. Peptide 3F14 had a slower half-time of clearance compared with 3F-2.TABLE 1[14C]Peptide turnover parameters3F-23F14T½ of absorption (h)0.090.11T½ of elimination (h)0.542.10Time to Cmax (h)0.280.48Cmax (% injected cpm)5.52%12.29% Open table in a new tab Distri"
https://openalex.org/W2059797734,"Substitution of the heme coordination residue Met-80 of the electron transport protein yeast iso-1-cytochrome c allows external ligands like CO to bind and thus increase the effective redox potential. This mutation, in principle, turns the protein into a quasi-native photoactivable electron donor. We have studied the kinetic and spectral characteristics of geminate recombination of heme and CO in a series of single M80X (X = Ala, Ser, Asp, Arg) mutants, using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. In these proteins, all geminate recombination occurs on the picosecond and early nanosecond time scale, in a multiphasic manner, in which heme relaxation takes place on the same time scale. The extent of geminate recombination varies from >99% (Ala, Ser) to ∼70% (Arg), the latter value being in principle low enough for electron injection studies. The rates and extent of the CO geminate recombination phases are much higher than in functional ligand-binding proteins like myoglobin, presumably reflecting the rigid and hydrophobic properties of the heme environment, which are optimized for electron transfer. Thus, the dynamics of CO recombination in cytochrome c are a tool for studying the heme pocket, in a similar way as NO in myoglobin. We discuss the differences in the CO kinetics between the mutants in terms of the properties of the heme environment and strategies to enhance the CO escape yield. Experiments on double mutants in which Phe-82 is replaced by Asp or Gly as well as the M80D substitution indicate that such steric changes substantially increase the motional freedom-dissociated CO.

Experiments on double mutants in which Phe-82 is replaced by Asp or Gly as well as the M80D substitution indicate that such steric changes substantially increase the motional freedom-dissociated CO. Electron transfer reactions between and within proteins bearing redox-active constituents are abundant in the cell. Most physiological electron transfer reactions take place in the sub-millisecond time scale (1Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Experimentally, it is not possible to study the dynamics of such reactions by mechanically mixing the reactants (e.g. stopped-flow spectroscopy). Such dynamics may, however, be studied by the use of light pulses. This approach is obvious for systems where light is a natural trigger, such as photosynthetic systems, but in some cases this approach can also be used with other pigmented proteins. The method we intend to develop relies on the fact that the gaseous ligand carbon monoxide (CO) 4The abbreviations used are: CO, carbon monoxide; cyt., cytochrome; cm-cyt. c, carboxymethylated cytochrome c; ferri-cyt. c, ferricytochrome c; Mb, myoglobin. 4The abbreviations used are: CO, carbon monoxide; cyt., cytochrome; cm-cyt. c, carboxymethylated cytochrome c; ferri-cyt. c, ferricytochrome c; Mb, myoglobin. has a high affinity for ferrous heme proteins but does not bind to the ferric heme counterpart. Therefore, the effect of CO is to increase the apparent redox potential of any heme protein that has a vacant sixth coordination position and is thus able to bind this ligand. The CO molecule can be photo-cleaved from heme with a quantum yield close to unity (i.e. one CO molecule photodissociated for each photon absorbed by the heme group). Thus, a light pulse will dissociate the CO from the heme group, leaving this as a 5-coordinate high spin ferrous species. This has the effect of rapidly switching the redox potential of the protein that stabilizes the ferrous form (the CO adduct) into a good electron donor (5-coordinate ferrous heme). Provided CO does not rebind rapidly (i.e. >10–5 s), photo-induced electron transfer can thus take place. These features have been exploited to investigate intraprotein electron transfer from photodissociated 5-coordinated heme a3 in the active site of native cytochrome c oxidase, where CO acts as an inhibitor (2Boelens R. Wever R. Van Gelder B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and recently used to determine a rate as high as ∼109 s–1 (3Pilet E. Jasaitis A. Liebl U. Vos M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; : 16198-16203Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This study focuses on cytochrome c (cyt. c), a ubiquitous, small, soluble electron transfer protein carrying one heme cofactor. In native cyt. c, the heme iron is coordinated by two internal axial ligands, His-18 and Met-80, and cannot bind CO. However in methionine-modified forms (4Brzezinski P. Wilson M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6176-6179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Larsen R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1619: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), like carboxymethylated cytochrome c (cm-cyt. c), chemical modification of Met-80 precludes formation of the heme iron–Met-80 bond and allows CO to bind. In a sizeable fraction of cm-cyt. c (12–26% depending on the modification protocol (6Silkstone G. Jasaitis A. Vos M.H. Wilson M.T. Dalton Trans. 2005; 21: 3489-3494Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar)), CO rebinding is slow enough to allow flash-induced oxidation of the heme. This technique has been successfully used to study electron transfer from cm-cyt. c to cytochrome c oxidase (4Brzezinski P. Wilson M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6176-6179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and to plastocyanin (7Karpefors M. Wilson M.T. Brzezinski P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These studies have provided proof of principle for the method, but the use of cm-cyt. c, although useful, is not ideal. This is primarily because the carboxymethylation reaction is not specific and can also lead to chemical modification of important “docking” residues on the surface of the protein. With the objective of developing a method for studying inter-protein electron transfer that employs proteins in “quasi-native” states, we have made a series of Met-80 mutants of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c, namely M80A, M80S, M80T, M80D, and M80E (8Silkstone G. Stanway G. Brzezinski P. Wilson M.T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Such mutants bind CO (8Silkstone G. Stanway G. Brzezinski P. Wilson M.T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Bren K.L. Gray H.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 10382-10383Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the solution structure of yeast cyano-M80A ferri-cyt. c (10Bren K.L. Gray H.B. Banci L. Bertini I. Turano P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8067-8073Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with labeled and some important amino acid residues that line the distal heme pocket where CO would normally bind to the ferrous heme iron (see under “Discussion”). The replacement residues for the native Met-80 were selected as those that were not expected to coordinate to the heme iron, especially in the ferrous redox state. However, for electron transfer experiments, these mutants have one drawback, namely that the apparent quantum yield (φ) for photon-induced CO escape from the protein is very small (8Silkstone G. Stanway G. Brzezinski P. Wilson M.T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This is because of rapid and efficient “geminate” recombination of CO and the heme. We have recently shown that in cm-cyt. c such recombination is multiphasic and predominantly takes place on the picosecond time scale (6Silkstone G. Jasaitis A. Vos M.H. Wilson M.T. Dalton Trans. 2005; 21: 3489-3494Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), i.e. much faster than inter-protein electron transfer (typically ∼105 s–1). In contrast to NO recombination, extensive geminate recombination of CO and heme is seldom observed in native natural ligand-binding proteins like myoglobin (Mb), and in particular not on the sub-nanosecond time scale (11Vos M.H. Martin J.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The fact that such recombination, by contrast, dominates in cyt. c can be understood in general terms by the absence of a “natural” ligand exchange pathway and by a different regime of protein dynamics in this electron transfer protein. For efficient low driving force electron transfer to occur, the reorganization energy of the environment of the redox partner (in the case of cyt. c the heme) should be small. Indeed, in cyt. c the heme group is surrounded by a hydrophobic and relatively rigid pocket (12Flynn P.F. Bieber Urbauer R.J. Zhang H. Lee A.L. Wand A.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6559-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Louie G.V. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 527-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and the protein contribution to the reorganization energy of cyt. c is thought to be weak (14Muegge I. Qi P.X. Wand A.J. Chu Z.T. Warshel A. J. Phys. Chem. 1997; 101: 825-836Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Simonson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6544-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Structural flexibility is not advantageous for that function. In contrast, proteins where ligand transfer is essential, structural flexibility is required to create temporary passages through which ligands may diffuse. In a general sense, the constructed CO-binding cyt. c mutants offer a unique chance to study these dynamics-function relations by comparison with functional ligand-binding proteins like Mb. Studying the picosecond/nanosecond recombination dynamics of CO and heme in cyt. c proteins incorporating an M80X mutation can give insight into the heme environment. In a similar way, in wild type and mutant Mb, multiphasic picosecond heme-NO recombination kinetics have proven a sensitive tool for assessing the dynamic, steric, and electrostatic role of the heme environment (16Martin J.-L.

As mentioned above, in Mb, CO geminate recombination is usually less extensive and takes place on a much longer time scale (23Sugimoto T. Unno M. Shiro Y. Dou Y. Ikeda-Saito M. Biophys.

To gain insight into the dynamic properties of the hydrophobic heme-binding core of cyt. c and in particular to investigate ways to optimize the escape probability of photodissociated CO by modifying the heme environment, we have measured CO recombination kinetics in a number of cyt. c mutants. Using spectrally resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, we also determined the heme spectra associated with different decay phases, which are indicators of the interaction of the heme with its environment, and in particular with the dissociated nearby ligand. This initial study concerns a limited number of mutants. By substituting Met-80 the idea was to investigate the effects of introducing both steric and hydrophobic constraints. In addition to proteins bearing Ala, Ser, and Asp at this position, which were previously shown to have a low millisecond CO escape efficiency (φ < 0.05) (8Silkstone G. Stanway G. Brzezinski P. Wilson M.T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we investigate the effect of the more bulky, charged residue Arg. Furthermore, starting from the M80D mutation, the effect of the additional substitution of the close-lying Phe-82 by a smaller residue (Asp or Gly) is explored. Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis, protein expression in Escherichia coli, and purification of yeast iso-1-cytochrome c mutants bearing single (M80A, M80S, M80D, or M80R) mutations in the heme environment were performed as described previously (8Silkstone G. Stanway G. Brzezinski P. Wilson M.T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The double mutations (M80D/F82D or M80D/F82G) were introduced using a single-step PCR approach (8Silkstone G. Stanway G. Brzezinski P. Wilson M.T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and in addition using the M80D mutated pBPCYC1(wt)/3 plasmid construct as template DNA. In these proteins, the Cys-102 residue is also changed to a Thr to prevent dimerization through formation of disulfide bridges. Sample Preparation for Ultrafast Spectroscopy—The samples were prepared to a heme concentration of ∼50 μm in a gas-tight optical cell with an optical path length of 1 mm. Unless indicated otherwise, the buffer was 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0. For the deoxy form, the samples were de-gassed and reduced with 1 mm sodium dithionite. For the carboxy form, the deoxy samples were equilibrated with 1 atm (1 atm = 101.3 kPa) CO. For the nitrosyl form, de-gassed samples were reduced with 10 mm sodium ascorbate and equilibrated with 0.01 atm NO. For the oxy form, 10 mm sodium ascorbate was added to an air-equilibrated sample. Ultrafast Spectroscopy—Multicolor femtosecond absorption spectroscopy (16Martin J.-L. Vos M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 416-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was performed with a 30-fs pump pulse centered at 565 nm and a <30-fs white light continuum probe pulse, at a repetition rate of 30 Hz. Full spectra of the test and reference beams were recorded using a combination of a polychromator and a CCD camera. All experiments were carried out at 21 °C. The sample was continuously moved perpendicular to the beams to ensure sample renewal between shots. Basic data matrix manipulations and presentation were performed using Matlab (The Mathworks, South Natick, MA). The absorbance changes were treated using the SPLYMOD algorithm (26Provencher S.W. Vogel R.H. Deuflhard P. Hairer E. Numerical Treatment of Inverse Problems in Differential and Integral Equations. 2. Birkhauser, Boston1983: 304-319Google Scholar), with a Matlab interface (27Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Puustinen A. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15633-15637Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Determination of Quantum Yield of CO Escape—The apparent quantum yield φ of dissociated CO on the millisecond time scale was also measured by the “pulsed” method developed by Brunori and co-workers (28Brunori M. Giacometti G.M. Antonini E. Wyman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3141-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and as described previously (8Silkstone G. Stanway G. Brzezinski P. Wilson M.T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The method determines the value of φ for a given protein relative to a standard, generally Mb, for which the value is assigned as φ = 1(i.e. unity quantum yield). Bimolecular Binding of Gaseous Ligands to the Ferrous Forms of M80A (CO, O2, and NO) and M80D (CO and NO) by Flow Mixing—Protein concentrations were typically 3–5 μm final after flow mixing. The mutant proteins were reduced prior to mixing by additions of sodium dithionite. For the CO and NO experiments, an excess of sodium dithionite was added to remove any dissolved O2 from solution assumed to be present at a concentration of ∼280 μm at 20 °C (29Weiss R.F. Deep-Sea Res. Ocean. Abstr. 1970; 17: 721-735Crossref Scopus (1530) Google Scholar), therefore eliminating competition between gaseous ligands for the ferrous iron (see below for O2). The temperature was maintained at 20 °C in all flow experiments. The observed rates (kobs, s–1) of ligand binding were fitted to single exponential fits and plotted, for each ligand, as a function of their concentration (μm). The data points for each ligand for M80A were then fitted with a rectangular hyperbola (see “Discussion”). The data points for each ligand for M80D were fitted to straight lines (see “Discussion”). Preparation and Calibration of CO Solutions for Bimolecular Binding Studies—Sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7) was placed into a glass tonometer, and the solution was degassed thoroughly with vigorous shaking. CO was passed into the tonometer with mild shaking until the gas had completely equilibrated with the solution, and a slightly positive pressure was obtained. The CO solution was transferred from the tonometer to an Agla glass syringe connected to a micrometer screw gauge. A Mb sample of an absolute known concentration (∼10 μm) was prepared using an extinction coefficient of 121,000 m–1 cm–1 at 435 nm for the deoxy form (30Antonini E. Physiol. Rev. 1965; 45: 123-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Mb was reduced with a slight excess of sodium dithionite and placed in an ∼3-ml cuvette that had been previously weighed in addition to a suba-seal. The sample was sealed, and no gas phase was present. The cuvette and sample were then re-weighed assuming 1 g = 1 ml. Spectra (375–650 nm) were recorded of the Mb sample titrated with 2-μl additions of the CO solution until saturation of the protein with CO had been achieved (i.e. no further changes in the absorbance on additions of CO). The suba-seal was then removed, and ∼5 ml of pure CO gas was bubbled through the sample so that complete saturation of the solution was achieved. The final spectrum was then recorded. Each addition of 2 μl of CO caused an increase in absorbance at 424 nm, and so the absorbance change at 424 nm minus at 650 nm was plotted against the volume of CO added. The first point on this plot where subsequent additions of CO produced no further change in absorbance was taken as the 1:1 binding of heme with CO (assuming no free heme present), and so with the concentration of Mb exactly known as well as the volume of the solution, the concentration of CO in the sample was deduced and hence that of the stock CO solution. For the stopped-flow reactions of M80A and CO, the stock CO solution was prepared in sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7). For the stopped-flow reactions of M80D and CO, the stock CO solution was prepared in sodium acetate buffer (100 mm, pH 4.8), the CO concentration being determined by titration with Mb at pH 7. Preparation of NO Solutions for Bimolecular Binding Studies—The NO solutions for direct use in the stopped-flow apparatus were prepared using stock solutions of Proli NONOate (Axxora) stored in 25 mm NaOH. The concentration of a stock Proli NONOate solution was determined using the extinction coefficient of 8,600 m–1 cm–1 at 248 nm (commonly 12–14 mm). For each Proli NONOate molecule, 2× NO was released on lowering of the pH. A known amount of stock Proli NONOate solution was added to a glass syringe containing either sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7) for M80A or sodium acetate buffer (100 mm pH 4.8) for M80D prior to mixing. The highest concentration of NO in solution prior to mixing was ∼1 mm and was therefore 0.5 mm in NO after mixing with protein. Both buffer solutions were de-gassed prior to addition of the stock Proli NONOate solution so as to prevent unwanted side reactions of NO and O2. NO solutions were subsequently diluted with de-gassed buffer solutions. Preparation of Fe2+-M80A and O2 Solutions for Bimolecular Binding Studies—The concentration of dissolved oxygen in sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7) was assumed to be ∼280 μm at 20 °C prior to dilution into de-gassed phosphate buffer and flow mixing. M80A was reduced with a minimum amount of sodium dithionite (10–20 μm total) so as to prevent the removal of the O2 being introduced on flow mixing. M80A is very resistant to autooxidation by air, and so can readily form a stable ferrous iron/oxygen adduct. The rate of autooxidation of M80A has been determined as k =∼1.8 days–1 (31Silkstone G. Biophysical Studies on Methionine-80 Mutants of Yeast Iso-1 Cytochrome C, Ph.D. thesis. University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar). M80S can also form a stable ferrous iron/oxygen adduct with k =∼0.7 days–1. However, all other mutant proteins in this study autooxidize sufficiently quickly so that the oxygen adducts cannot be observed in the time frame of the stopped-flow apparatus. CO Rebinding in Met-80 Single Mutants—Fig. 2A shows the transient spectra in the Soret band region at selected delay times after CO dissociation from the M80A mutant. The general shape of the spectra is typical of a 5-coordinate minus 6-coordinate ferrous heme spectrum (32Wood P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 293-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and denotes a red-shift of the Soret band after photolysis. The initial spectrum decays in a multiphasic time course on the picosecond and early nanosecond time scale, reflecting recombination of CO with the heme. Along with this decay the shape of the spectra also changes, and in particular the induced absorption maximum shifts from 424 nm at t = 1psto ∼432 nm on the hundreds of picoseconds time scale. These features are qualitatively similar to those observed for cm-cyt. c (6Silkstone G. Jasaitis A. Vos M.H. Wilson M.T. Dalton Trans. 2005; 21: 3489-3494Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and presumably, they reflect relaxation of the heme configuration during the recombination process. The analysis, in terms of spectra associated with exponential decay processes (decay-associated spectra), is shown in Fig. 2B where these relaxation processes are highlighted. In particular, the fastest decay phase, 14 ps, is associated with a much smaller red-shift than the later decay phases, 85 ps and 1.2 ns. In contrast to cm-cyt. c, at t = 4 ns, virtually all CO has recombined (Figs. 2A and 3). This finding is consistent with the reported very low (φ = 0.004) quantum yield of CO escape from the protein (8Silkstone G. Stanway G. Brzezinski P. Wilson M.T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Table 1) and implies that the geminate heme-CO recombination, which is at the origin of this loss in quantum yield, is completely covered by the 4-ns time window of this study.FIGURE 3CO recombination kinetics in single mutants at position 80 (M80A, ▪; M80D, ◂; M80R, •; M82S, ♦) as measured at 414 nm, near the maximum of the bleaching.

Open table in a new tab The transient spectra of the M80S and M80D mutants are qualitatively similar to the M80A mutant (not shown), but the kinetics are somewhat different (Fig. 3). For M80S, the overall picosecond rebinding kinetics are somewhat faster, and in particular no phase having a τ value longer than 100 ps is discerned. For this mutant also virtually all CO rebinds, in agreement with the low φ (Table 1). The kinetics for CO rebinding in M80D need to be described by three distinct exponential phases, as in M80A, but the time constants for all phases are significantly longer, and at t = 4 ns, ∼4% of the CO has not rebound, in good agreement with the reported φ = 0.04 for this mutant (8Silkstone G. Stanway G. Brzezinski P. Wilson M.T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Table 1). For the M80R mutant, both the transient spectra (Fig. 2C) and the decay kinetics (Fig. 3) stand apart from the Ala, Asp, and Ser mutants. The overall kinetics are relatively slow and can be described by two phases, the fastest of which has a time constant of 80 ps and no sub-50-ps phase. Importantly, the amplitude of the constant, non-rebinding phase (A0), is also much higher, 0.25, which is more than twice that observed in our previous experiments on cm-cyt. c (6Silkstone G. Jasaitis A. Vos M.H. Wilson M.T. Dalton Trans. 2005; 21: 3489-3494Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, the spectral evolution during the decay is far less pronounced (a moderate effect can be discerned from the decay-associated spectra of the 80-ps component; see Fig. 2D), and the shift feature is much more symmetric than in the other mutants, where the induced absorption band is relatively broad at all delay times. Although for these proteins a steady-state 5-coordinate spectrum cannot be generated for direct comparison (see below), this latter finding suggests that in the M80R the heme rapidly adopts a more relaxed deoxy-like configuration after CO dissociation. Indeed, the spectrum is qualitatively similar to the steady-state CO dissociation spectra for Mb (33Petrich J.W. Poyart C. Martin J.-L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and the c-type heme-undecapeptide microperoxidase-11 (5Larsen R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1619: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). CO Rebinding in Double Mutants—To explore whether one may influence the probability of photodissociated CO escaping into bulk by further modifying the protein environment of the heme, we have generated double mutants in which in addition to the Met-80 to Asp mutation Phe-82 was replaced by the less bulky residues Gly or Asp. Both double mutants displayed very similar kinetics (Table 1), which were substantially slower than for the M80D single mutant (Fig. 4), and also the constant (A0) and non-rebinding phase was significantly higher. These findings indicate that the CO escape pathway indeed involves the close surroundings of Phe-82. Interestingly, the transient spectra are more symmetric for the double mutants (Fig. 4, inset), already within picoseconds after CO dissociation. This indicates that the free volume created by the second mutation allows reduction of the interaction of the dissociated CO with heme. Taken together with the spectral and kinetic properties of M80R mutant (for both the differences with respect to the M80D single mutant are more pronounced), these data strongly suggest a correlation between the transient spectra and the speed and yield of heme-CO rebinding. NO Rebinding—In many natural ligand-binding heme proteins, NO rebinds predominantly on the picosecond time scale and in a multiphasic way that is very sensitive to the structure of the heme pocket (11Vos M.H. Martin J.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We have measured the spectral evolution upon excitation of the M80A-NO complex (Fig. 5), and we found that NO rebinding occurs fully in a single exponential phase with a time constant of 7 ps, i.e. in a very similar way as NO rebinding to wild type horse heart cyt. c (34Cianetti S.

https://openalex.org/W2057663335,"Signalling by the TGF-β superfamily member and BMP orthologue Decapentaplegic (Dpp) is crucial for multiple developmental programmes and has to be tightly regulated. Here, we demonstrate that the Drosophila Dpp pathway is negatively regulated by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), which mediates activation-dependent degradation of the Dpp signalling components Mad and Medea. eIF4A mutants exhibit increased Dpp signalling and accumulation of Mad and phospho-Mad. Overexpression of eIF4A decreases Dpp signalling and causes loss of Mad and phospho-Mad. Furthermore, eIF4A physically associates with Mad and Medea, and promotes their degradation following activation of Dpp signalling in a translation-independent manner. Finally, we show that eIF4A acts synergistically with, but independently of, the ubiquitin ligase DSmurf, indicating that a dual system controls SMAD degradation. Thus, in addition to being an obligatory component of the cap-dependent translation initiation complex, eIF4A has a novel function as a specific inhibitor of Dpp signalling that mediates the degradation of SMAD homologues."

However, certain point mutations in the γ-globin gene promoter are capable of maintaining expression of this gene during adult erythropoiesis, a condition called non-deletion hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Among these, the British form of HPFH carrying a T →C point mutation at position –198 of the Aγ-globin gene promoter results in 4–10% fetal hemoglobin in heterozygotes. In this study, we used nuclear extracts from murine erythroleukemia cells to purify a protein complex that binds the HPFH –198 γ-globin gene promoter. Members of this protein complex were identified by mass spectrometry and include DNMT1, the transcriptional coactivator p52, the protein SNEV, and RAP74 (the largest subunit of the general transcription factor IIF). Sp1, which was previously considered responsible for HPFH –198 γ-globin gene activation, was not identified. The potential role of these proteins in the reactivation and/or maintenance of γ-globin gene expression in the adult transcriptional environment is discussed. Expression of the γ-globin gene is silenced in adult humans. However, certain point mutations in the γ-globin gene promoter are capable of maintaining expression of this gene during adult erythropoiesis, a condition called non-deletion hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH).

The potential role of these proteins in the reactivation and/or maintenance of γ-globin gene expression in the adult transcriptional environment is discussed. The human β-globin gene cluster consists of five functional globin genes (ϵ, Gγ, Aγ, δ, and β) arranged in the locus according to the order of their expression during development. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that the expression of these genes during development depends on interactions between the individual globin gene promoters and the locus control region located 6–22 kb upstream of the ϵ-globin gene (1Stamatoyannopoulos G. Grosveld F.G. Hemoglobin Switching.3rd Ed. II. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2001Google Scholar). Two developmental expression switches occur in the β-globin locus: one from the embryonic ϵ gene to the fetal γ genes and later from the fetal γ genes to adult δ and β genes. Adult individuals express very low levels of the γ-globin genes (usually ∼0.5% of the total hemoglobin). However, single point mutations occurring in either the Gγ-or Aγ-globin gene promoter result in continued expression of the γ gene in the adult, a condition termed non-deletion hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) 3The abbreviations used are: HPFH, hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin; TF, transcription factor; MEL, murine erythroleukemia; WT, wild-type; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry. (reviewed in Refs. 1Stamatoyannopoulos G. Grosveld F.G. Hemoglobin Switching.3rd Ed. II. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2001Google Scholar and 2Forget B.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 850: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Structural studies have shown that non-deletion HPFH point mutations are clustered in three regions of the γ gene promoters centered around positions –200, –175, and –115 relative to the transcriptional start site (2Forget B.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 850: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The –200 region is a highly GC-rich region known to be the target for five different but closely spaced point mutations affecting the Gγ promoter at position –202 (C →G) and the Aγ promoter at position –202 (C →T), –198 (T →C), –196 (C →T), or –195 (C →G), respectively (1Stamatoyannopoulos G. Grosveld F.G. Hemoglobin Switching.3rd Ed. II. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2001Google Scholar, 2Forget B.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 850: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the increased γ-globin gene expression in adults carrying non-deletion HPFH mutations. The first proposes that these point mutations decrease the binding of a transcriptional repressor or a complex that is involved in the silencing of γ-globin expression in the adult. Alternatively, these mutations may create binding sites that enhance the binding for a transcriptional activator or complex, thus increasing γ gene expression in the adult. Early in vitro studies focused on characterizing the effects of these mutations on the binding of different DNA-binding proteins. The sequence similarity between the HPFH –198 mutation and the cognate Sp1 response element prompted in vitro studies, which suggested that this mutation increases the binding affinity for the transcriptional activator Sp1 (3Ronchi A. Nicolis S. Santoro C. Ottolenghi S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10231-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Fischer K.D. Nowock J.

Transgenic mice carrying the –117, –175, and –198 mutations display the phenotype of HPFH, providing direct evidence for the mechanistic relationship between mutation and phenotype (6Berry M. Grosveld F. Dillon N. Nature. 1992; 358: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 7Peterson K.R. Li Q.L. Clegg C.H. Furukawa T. Navas P.A. Norton E.J. Kimbrough T.G. Stamatoyannopoulos G.

We have shown previously that the HPFH –198 mutation is able to retain γ gene expression in adult transgenic mice when the CACCC box is disrupted (9Li Q. Duan Z.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because the CACCC box is indispensable for γ gene expression in the adult, these results suggested that the HPFH –198 mutation creates a new element that is able to substitute for the function of the CACCC box in adults. This study focused on the biochemical purification and characterization of proteins that bind to the Aγ-globin gene carrying the HPFH –198 (T →C) point mutation using non-biased methods. Chromatography and mass spectrometry identified a group of proteins that specifically eluted from an HPFH –198 oligonucleotide affinity column. Using commercially available antibodies, we were able to confirm the identity and HPFH –198 binding specificity of a subset of these proteins, including DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1), RAP74 (the largest subunit of the general transcription factor (TF) IIF), and the coactivator p52. Sp1 was not found in this complex. The implication and potential roles of these proteins are discussed in the context of regulating the expression of the γ-globin gene in adults. Gel Shift Assays—The DNA oligonucleotide sequences used in this work are shown in Fig. 1A. Position –198 and the CACCC box present in the human Aγ promoter are underlined, and their mutant counterparts are depicted in italic type. Radio-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (1.5 × 104 cpm, ∼4 fmol) were incubated with 3–6 μg of either murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell nuclear extract or protein from column fractions for 20 min at room temperature in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 0.3 μg of oligo(dI-dC)2). When necessary, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides or the amount of antibodies indicated in the figures was added and preincubated with proteins under similar conditions prior to adding the probe. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 5 mm MgCl2 in 1× Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 4 °C, followed by autoradiography.

Briefly, ∼1.8 × 1010 logarithmic phase MEL cells were harvested and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, followed by washing with a 5-fold packed cell volume of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, leupeptin, bestatin, and aprotinin). MEL cells were suspended in a 3-fold packed cell volume of hypotonic buffer plus protease inhibitor mixture, incubated on ice for 10 min, and homogenized by 10 strokes of a Dounce type B pestle (Wheaton Science Products, Millville, NJ). Cell lysis was checked by trypan blue exclusion under a microscope. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 3300 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, suspended in a 3.5-fold packed cell volume of ice-cold nuclear suspension buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9) 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) plus protease inhibitor mixture, and lysed by 15 strokes of a Dounce type A pestle. The suspension was complemented with the dropwise addition and mixing of 0.1 volume of ice-cold 3 m ammonium sulfate (pH 7.5) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with rocking. Chromatin was precipitated by centrifugation at 65,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C using a Beckman Ti-70 rotor. Proteins present in the supernatant were precipitated with a 65% cut using solid ammonium sulfate. Pelleted proteins were suspended in an ∼1-fold packed cell volume of ice-cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15% glycerol) containing 100 mm KCl (BC100) and supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture, dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against the same buffer, and stored at –70 °C for further use. Fractionation of MEL cell nuclear extract was done at 4 °C unless indicated otherwise. Approximately 500 mg of protein was loaded onto a packed column containing phosphocellulose resin (120 ml) previously equilibrated with BC100. The flow-through fraction was collected; the resin was washed extensively with BC100; and bound proteins were eluted in three batches with buffer C containing 300 (BC300), 500 (BC500), and 1000 (BC1000) mm KCl, respectively. For each elution, fractions (2.6 ml each) were collected, and their protein concentrations were estimated by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Fractions containing >0.1 μg/ml protein were pooled and dialyzed against BC100 prior to analysis of their HPFH –198 binding activity by gel shift assay. We packed Source Q resin (GE Healthcare) into a Tricorn column (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions to create our ownÁKTA-compatible Source Q column (9.5 ml of resin). The pooled 0.5 m phosphocellulose fraction (∼100 ml, 54 mg of total protein) was loaded onto this column, which was previously conditioned with BC100. The flow-through fraction was collected, and the column was washed with the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with BC1000 using a 21-column volume three-step programmed gradient consisting of 15 column volumes of 0–40% buffer C, 3 column volumes of 40–100% buffer C, and 3 column volumes of 100% buffer C. The collected fractions (2 ml) were dialyzed and analyzed for HPFH –198 binding activity in gel shift assays before they were pooled. Protein markers from a size exclusion chromatography kit (GE Healthcare) were used to calibrate a Superdex S-200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (23.56 ml; GE Healthcare) under stringent buffer conditions (BC500 containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40) using anÁKTA chromatography system (GE Healthcare). Nuclear extract from MEL cells (1 mg, 7.6 μg/μl) was fractionated in this column under the same buffer conditions. Fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected, dialyzed against BC100, and stored at –70 °C for further analysis. Aliquots derived from fractions from either the gel filtration (20 μl) or affinity chromatography (200–500 μl precipitated, see below) column were analyzed by Western blotting. Briefly, samples were separated on an 11% mini SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk in 0.3 m Tris/Tween-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Tween 20, 300 mm NaCl). Blots were washed with the same buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody against DNMT1 (1:5000 dilution; Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA), coactivator p52 (1:1000 dilution; ProteinOne, Bethesda, MD), or RAP74 (1:700 dilution; ProteinOne) with rocking. Membranes were washed with 0.3 m Tris/Tween-buffered saline and incubated with goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:2500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1.5 h. Finally, membranes were washed with 0.3 m Tris/Tween-buffered saline, and specific proteins were detected on x-ray films using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Affinity Resins, Tandem Oligonucleotide Affinity Purification, and Mass Spectrometry Identification of Proteins—The following forward (F) and reverse (R) phosphorylated single-stranded oligonucleotides comprising the human wild-type (WT) or HPFH –198 (T →C) point mutation Aγ-globin sequence were used for the preparation of WT and HPFH –198 oligonucleotide affinity resins: 5′-phos-GATCTTTTAGGGGCCCCTTCCCCACACTAT-3′ (WT-F), 5′-phos-TAAAAGATCATAGTGTGGGGAAGGGGCCCC-3′ (WT-R), 5′-phos-GATCTTTTAGGGGCCCCTCCCCCACACTAT-3′ (HPFH-F), and 5′-phos-TAAAAGATCATAGTGTGGGGGAGGGGCCCC-3′ (HPFH-R). The only difference in these sequences is the underlined point mutation at position –198. These oligonucleotides are identical to those used for the gel shift assays shown in Fig. 1A. An additional 9-nucleotide overhang sequence was added at each end to create sticky ends once they were annealed. Online data base searches indicated that this 9-bp extension did not harbor any potential DNA-binding sequence. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis and annealed to form complementary WT and HPFH –198 double-stranded oligonucleotides. Five-hundred μg of each was then ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) to form concatemers (10 copies on average), which were then coupled to 10 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads following published protocols (49Kerrigan L.A. Kadonaga J.T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 12.10.1-12.10.18Google Scholar) to create the WT and HPFH –198 oligonucleotide affinity columns. Before chromatography, the pooled Source Q protein fraction was supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 3 μg/ml oligo(dI-dC)2, thus bringing the buffer conditions similar to those used in gel mobility shift assays. This mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was used as the input material for the tandem oligonucleotide affinity chromatography step. Usually 2 ml of input material was gently rocked for 30 min at room temperature in a column containing an equal volume of packed WT oligonucleotide resin previously equilibrated with affinity buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) containing 100 mm KCl (AF100). The column was placed on a stand, and the flow-through fraction was collected on ice by gravity and reapplied to the column nine more times at room temperature. The last flow-through fraction was collected; the WT –198 oligonucleotide column was washed with 10 column volumes of AF100; and the bound proteins were eluted with 1.5 column volumes of affinity buffer containing 1000 mm KCl (AF1000) and 2000 mm KCl (AF2000), respectively. The last flow-through fraction from the WT oligonucleotide column was combined with its first column volume wash and used as the input material for the HPFH –198 oligonucleotide column. After a similar incubation and reapplication process, the flow-through fraction from the HPFH –198 oligonucleotide column was collected; the resin was washed with 10 column volumes of AF100; and the bound proteins were eluted with 1.5 column volumes of AF500, AF1000, and AF2000, respectively. Collected fractions were dialyzed against BC100 and frozen at –70 °C. To visualize the eluted proteins from the tandem oligonucleotide affinity chromatography step, 150–250-μl aliquots of each of the column fractions were precipitated overnight at –20 °C with 4 volumes of cold acetone in the presence of 10 μg of human recombinant insulin (Sigma) as a carrier. This mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pelleted proteins were washed twice with 1 ml of cold acetone, dried at 37 °C, and suspended in 20 μl of suspension buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, and 5% glycerol). Samples were complemented with 6× SDS loading buffer and run on an 11% mini SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were either transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis (see above) or silver-stained following the kit instructions (Bio-Rad). To identify proteins in the HPFH –198 oligonucleotide column fractions, bands were excised from the silver-stained gel, processed, and in gel-digested with trypsin (Roche Applied Science) following described protocols (11Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar, 12Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). The peptides obtained were identified with a capillary liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure ionization quadrupole orthogonal accelerator time-of-flight hybrid tandem mass spectrometer (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK). Online data mining was done with the Matrix Science Mascot tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) ion search algorithm (www.matrixscience.com) using both the mouse and NCBI non-redundant protein data bases. HPFH –198 Binding Activity Is Related to the CACCC Box but Differs from Sp1—We performed gel shift assays to analyze the binding specificity of the HPFH –198 probe using MEL cell nuclear extract. There were three major retarded bands (Fig. 1B, lane 1, arrows a-c) that were competed away by the unlabeled HPFH –198 oligonucleotide (lane 4), but not by the WT –198 oligonucleotide (lane 5). These bands were partially competed away with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled WT CACCC oligonucleotide (lane 2), but not by the mutant CACCC oligonucleotide (lane 3), suggesting that the proteins forming these retarded bands are associated with the CACCC family, as reported previously (3Ronchi A. Nicolis S. Santoro C. Ottolenghi S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10231-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Fischer K.D. Nowock J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5685-5693Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Gumucio D.L. Rood K.L. Blanchard-McQuate K.L. Gray T.A. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Blood. 1991; 78: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Li Q. Duan Z.J. Stamatoyannopoulos G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Below the three bands, there were several fast migrating bands (bracket d). The occurrence and intensity of these bands varied in different MEL cell extracts. In addition, these bands were not competed away by unlabeled oligonucleotides, including HPFH –198 (lanes 2–6), suggesting that they are nonspecific binding products. A number of reports have characterized the transcriptional activator Sp1 as a potential factor binding to the HPFH –198 mutation (3Ronchi A. Nicolis S. Santoro C. Ottolenghi S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10231-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Fischer K.D. Nowock J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5685-5693Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Gumucio D.L. Rood K.L. Blanchard-McQuate K.L. Gray T.A. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Blood. 1991; 78: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were able to reproduce these results by demonstrating that unlabeled Sp1 oligonucleotide competed away three major complexes as shown in Fig. 1B (lane 6, arrows a–c). However, we found that anti-Sp1 antibody had no effect on the retarded bands generated on the HPFH –198 probe (lane 8). A similar outcome was observed when anti-IgG control antibody was used (lane 9). Used as a positive control, the same anti-Sp1 antibody clearly supershifted the retarded band formed when human recombinant Sp1 protein bound to the Sp1 probe (compare lanes 10 and 11). Titration of either the nuclear extract or the antibodies under these conditions resulted in similar results (data not shown). The presence of Sp1 in MEL cell extracts was confirmed by Western hybridization (Fig. 1C). MEL cell extracts generated strong signals in the immunoblot assay using anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–4). Recombinant Sp1 served as a positive control (lane 5). Moreover, the Sp1 abundance decreased during the purification progress. For instance, only a small amount of Sp1 was detected in Source Q column fractions (lanes 6 and 7). Thus, these experiments strongly suggest that the proteins that binds specifically to the HPFH –198 probe (arrows a–c) are different from Sp1. Moreover, these proteins are able to bind the Sp1 consensus motif, whereas Sp1 protein is unable to bind the HPFH –198 oligonucleotide. Purification Profile and MEL Cell Nuclear Extract Fractionation—Fig. 2A outlines the scheme of purification of the HPFH –198 mutation-binding proteins. Approximately 0.5 g of MEL cell nuclear extract was fractionated by column chromatography using a phosphocellulose resin. The flow-through fraction was collected; the resin was washed extensively with BC100; and bound proteins were eluted into three batches with BC300, BC500, and BC1000, respectively. Fig. 2B shows the HPFH –198 gel shift activity of these batch-eluted fractions after dialysis against BC100. As shown at the top of Fig. 2B, the activity of each batch was then competed by a 100-fold excess of either unlabeled HPFH or WT –198 oligonucleotide as described previously for Fig. 1A. Most of the HPFH –198 binding activity resided in the fractions that eluted at 0.5 and 1.0 m. After four independent chromatography fractionation experiments, the percentage of the total nuclear protein found in the flow-through and 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 m fractions was 39, 47.1, 11.6, and 2.3%, respectively. The 0.5 m phosphocellulose fraction was then loaded into an ÁKTA Source Q column and fractionated using a triphasic isocratic gradient. The elution profile is shown in Fig. 2C. Column fractions were dialyzed against BC100, and their HPFH –198 binding activity was analyzed by gel shift assay (Fig. 2D). We used a shallow gradient and found that the activity consistently eluted between 150 and 370 mm KCl, thus explaining the wide spread among the collected fractions. After quantitative protein analysis of each fraction and considering the elution and activity profiles (Fig. 2, C and D), we pooled only fractions 27–40, thus sacrificing some HPFH –198 binding activity for protein purity. The pooled activity thus represents 8% of the total protein loaded onto the Source Q column and ∼1% of the starting MEL cell nuclear extract. To take advantage of the single point mutation difference between the WT and HPFH –198 oligonucleotides, we designed a tandem oligonucleotide affinity purification step. Following incubation of the Source Q pool with the concatemerized WT –198 oligonucleotide resin, the unbound fraction was combined with the first column volume wash and used as the input material for HPFH –198 oligonucleotide affinity chromatography. The WT resin was extensively washed, and bound proteins were eluted in two steps with 1.5 volumes of AF1000 and AF2000, respectively. Similarly, after incubation with the HPFH –198 resin, the flow-through fraction was collected; the resin was washed extensively; and bound proteins were eluted in 1.5 volumes of AF500, AF1000, and AF2000, respectively. The bulk of the HPFH –198 mutation-bound proteins were present in the first two fractions (see Fig. 4, upper panel), which were combined and dialyzed against BC100. Proteins present in aliquots (200–500 μl) of this combined fraction were precipitated with acetone in the presence of human recombinant insulin (10 μg) and separated on an 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Fig. 3 is a representative silver-stained gel showing the proteins that eluted from the HPFH –198 oligonucleotide column, those in the input material, and molecular mass markers. Bands present in the HPFH –198 lane were excised; proteins were digested with trypsin; and peptides were identified using the liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure ionization quadrupole orthogonal accelerator time-of-flight hybrid tandem mass spectrometer. Data mining was done online with the Matrix Science Mascot MS/MS ion search algorithm using both the mouse and NCBI non-redundant protein data bases. Bands identities are shown on the right of the gel and are summarized in Table 1.FIGURE 3Analysis of proteins that eluted from the HPFH –198 oligonucleotide affinity column. After tandem oligonucleotide affinity purification, aliquots from the 0.5 and 1 m fractions eluted from the HPFH –198 oligonucleotide column were combined, and proteins were precipitated with cold acetone, suspended, and run on an 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands were visualized by silver staining, excised from the gel, and processed for mass spectrometry identification. The protein bands identified are shown on the right lane, and migration of molecular mass markers is shown in the left lane. Proteins present in an aliquot of the input material (30 μl) are shown in the center lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Peptides identified in the putative HPFH –198 complex purified using an affinity columnPeptideNCBI accession no.Molecular massNo. of peptides identifiedProtein coverageDa%DNMT1AAH53.047183,17460∼40CDC5-likeNP69002392,1336∼10RAP74NP59856257,2066∼11SNEVNP59889055,2044∼7p52CAC3494537,4034∼13UnnamedBAB2849037,5485∼18 Open table in a new tab Peptides Identified by Mass Spectrometry—The highest molecular mass protein (183 kDa) that bound to the HPFH –198 oligonucleotide was identified as DNMT1 in seven independent experiments. Mass spectrometry detected a total of 60 unique peptides identified to be portions of DNMT1, representing ∼40% of its amino acid sequence. DNMT1 has been implicated in maintaining methylation patterns established during development and newly synthesized DNA at replication foci in eukaryotes (13Robertson K.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5361-5379Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 14Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5448) Google Scholar). DNMT1 does not bind DNA directly, but is most likely recruited via protein-protein interactions. The protein band migrating at ∼100 kDa was identified in four independent experiments as mouse CDC5-like protein (Fig. 3). We based our identification on six different peptides covering ∼10% of its amino acid sequence. This protein is an ortholog of the G2/M cell cycle regulator protein Cdc5 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The third protein identified in two independent experiments with a total of six peptides covering 11% of its protein sequence was RAP74, the largest subunit of TFIIF. Human RAP74 associates with the smaller subunit RAP30 to form a tetramer and, as such, associates with RNA polymerase II (15Lei L. Ren D. Finkelstein A. Burton Z.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2130-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Flores O. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8913-8921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse nuclear matrix protein SNEV, which migrated as a ghost band (i.e. negatively stained with silver) in the gel at ∼55 kDa, was identified as the forth protein binding to the HPFH –198 mutation. Four different polypeptides covering ∼7% of this protein were identified in five independent experiments. SNEV is 99% identical to the human nuclear matrix protein NMP200 (17Gotzmann J. Gerner C. Meissner M. Holzmann K. Grimm R. Mikulits W. Sauermann G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which is in turn related to the human splicing factor PRP19, thus potentially implicating SNEV in splicing. The fifth protein identified in two independent experiments with four different peptides covering ∼13% of the protein was the coactivator p52. This protein is derived from an alternatively spliced 15-exon gene encoding both p5"
