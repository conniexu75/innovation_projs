https://openalex.org/W2081020587,"Historically, the study of speech processing has emphasized a strong link between auditory perceptual input and motor production output. A kind of 'parity' is essential, as both perception- and production-based representations must form a unified interface to facilitate access to higher-order language processes such as syntax and semantics, believed to be computed in the dominant, typically left hemisphere. Although various theories have been proposed to unite perception and production, the underlying neural mechanisms are unclear. Early models of speech and language processing proposed that perceptual processing occurred in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) and motor production processes occurred in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area). Sensory activity was proposed to link to production activity through connecting fibre tracts, forming the left lateralized speech sensory-motor system. Although recent evidence indicates that speech perception occurs bilaterally, prevailing models maintain that the speech sensory-motor system is left lateralized and facilitates the transformation from sensory-based auditory representations to motor-based production representations. However, evidence for the lateralized computation of sensory-motor speech transformations is indirect and primarily comes from stroke patients that have speech repetition deficits (conduction aphasia) and studies using covert speech and haemodynamic functional imaging. Whether the speech sensory-motor system is lateralized, like higher-order language processes, or bilateral, like speech perception, is controversial. Here we use direct neural recordings in subjects performing sensory-motor tasks involving overt speech production to show that sensory-motor transformations occur bilaterally. We demonstrate that electrodes over bilateral inferior frontal, inferior parietal, superior temporal, premotor and somatosensory cortices exhibit robust sensory-motor neural responses during both perception and production in an overt word-repetition task. Using a non-word transformation task, we show that bilateral sensory-motor responses can perform transformations between speech-perception- and speech-production-based representations. These results establish a bilateral sublexical speech sensory-motor system."
https://openalex.org/W1996025323,"The phytohormone auxin is involved in a wide range of developmental processes and auxin signaling is known to modulate the expression of target genes via two types of transcriptional regulators, namely, Aux/IAA and Auxin Response Factors (ARF). ARFs play a major role in transcriptional activation or repression through direct binding to the promoter of auxin-responsive genes. The present study aims at gaining better insight on distinctive structural and functional features among ARF proteins.Building on the most updated tomato (Solanum lycopersicon) reference genome sequence, a comprehensive set of ARF genes was identified, extending the total number of family members to 22. Upon correction of structural annotation inconsistencies, renaming the tomato ARF family members provided a consensus nomenclature for all ARF genes across plant species. In silico search predicted the presence of putative target site for small interfering RNAs within twelve Sl-ARFs while sequence analysis of the 5'-leader sequences revealed the presence of potential small uORF regulatory elements. Functional characterization carried out by transactivation assay partitioned tomato ARFs into repressors and activators of auxin-dependent gene transcription. Expression studies identified tomato ARFs potentially involved in the fruit set process. Genome-wide expression profiling using RNA-seq revealed that at least one third of the gene family members display alternative splicing mode of regulation during the flower to fruit transition. Moreover, the regulation of several tomato ARF genes by both ethylene and auxin, suggests their potential contribution to the convergence mechanism between the signaling pathways of these two hormones.All together, the data bring new insight on the complexity of the expression control of Sl-ARF genes at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels supporting the hypothesis that these transcriptional mediators might represent one of the main components that enable auxin to regulate a wide range of physiological processes in a highly specific and coordinated manner."
https://openalex.org/W2149919161,"Abiotic stresses are major environmental factors that affect agricultural productivity worldwide. NAC transcription factors play pivotal roles in abiotic stress signaling in plants. As a staple crop, wheat production is severely constrained by abiotic stresses whereas only a few NAC transcription factors have been characterized functionally. To promote the application of NAC genes in wheat improvement by biotechnology, a novel NAC gene designated TaNAC67 was characterized in common wheat. To determine its role, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TaNAC67-GFP controlled by the CaMV-35S promoter was generated and subjected to various abiotic stresses for morphological and physiological assays. Gene expression showed that TaNAC67 was involved in response to drought, salt, cold and ABA treatments. Localization assays revealed that TaNAC67 localized in the nucleus. Morphological analysis indicated the transgenics had enhanced tolerances to drought, salt and freezing stresses, simultaneously supported by enhanced expression of multiple abiotic stress responsive genes and improved physiological traits, including strengthened cell membrane stability, retention of higher chlorophyll contents and Na+ efflux rates, improved photosynthetic potential, and enhanced water retention capability. Overexpression of TaNAC67 resulted in pronounced enhanced tolerances to drought, salt and freezing stresses, therefore it has potential for utilization in transgenic breeding to improve abiotic stress tolerance in crops."
https://openalex.org/W2015363484,"The most widely spread measure of performance, accuracy, suffers from a paradox: predictive models with a given level of accuracy may have greater predictive power than models with higher accuracy. Despite optimizing classification error rate, high accuracy models may fail to capture crucial information transfer in the classification task. We present evidence of this behavior by means of a combinatorial analysis where every possible contingency matrix of 2, 3 and 4 classes classifiers are depicted on the entropy triangle, a more reliable information-theoretic tool for classification assessment. Motivated by this, we develop from first principles a measure of classification performance that takes into consideration the information learned by classifiers. We are then able to obtain the entropy-modulated accuracy (EMA), a pessimistic estimate of the expected accuracy with the influence of the input distribution factored out, and the normalized information transfer factor (NIT), a measure of how efficient is the transmission of information from the input to the output set of classes. The EMA is a more natural measure of classification performance than accuracy when the heuristic to maximize is the transfer of information through the classifier instead of classification error count. The NIT factor measures the effectiveness of the learning process in classifiers and also makes it harder for them to “cheat” using techniques like specialization, while also promoting the interpretability of results. Their use is demonstrated in a mind reading task competition that aims at decoding the identity of a video stimulus based on magnetoencephalography recordings. We show how the EMA and the NIT factor reject rankings based in accuracy, choosing more meaningful and interpretable classifiers."
https://openalex.org/W2111973128,"The eutrophication of freshwaters is a global health concern as lakes with excess nutrients are often subject to toxic cyanobacterial blooms. Although phosphorus is considered the main element regulating cyanobacterial biomass, nitrogen (N) concentration and more specifically the availability of different N forms may influence the overall toxicity of blooms. In this study of three eutrophic lakes prone to cyanobacterial blooms, we examined the effects of nitrogen species and concentrations and other environmental factors in influencing cyanobacterial community structure, microcystin (MC) concentrations and MC congener composition. The identification of specific MC congeners was of particular interest as they vary widely in toxicity. Different nitrogen forms appeared to influence cyanobacterial community structure leading to corresponding effects on MC concentrations and composition. Total MC concentrations across the lakes were largely explained by a combination of abiotic factors: dissolved organic nitrogen, water temperature and ammonium, but Microcystis spp. biomass was overall the best predictor of MC concentrations. Environmental factors did not appear to affect MC congener composition directly but there were significant associations between specific MC congeners and particular species. Based on redundancy analyses (RDA), the relative biomass of Microcystis aeruginosa was associated with MC-RR, M. wesenbergii with MC-LA and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae with MC-YR. The latter two species are not generally considered capable of MC production. Total nitrogen, water temperature, ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen influenced the cyanobacterial community structure, which in turn resulted in differences in the dominant MC congener and the overall toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1986294369,"The benefits of clinical trials registration include improved transparency on clinical trials for healthcare workers and patients, increased accountability of trialists, the potential to address publication bias and selective reporting, and possibilities for research collaboration and prioritization. However, poor quality of information in registered records of trials has been found to undermine these benefits in the past. Trialists' increasing experience with trial registration and recent developments in registration systems may have positively affected data quality. This study was conducted to investigate whether the quality of registration has improved.We repeated a study from 2009, using the same methods and the same research team. A random sample of 400 records of clinical trials that were registered between 01/01/2012 and 01/01/2013 was taken from the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and assessed for the quality of information on 1) contact details, 2) interventions and 3) primary outcomes. Results were compared to the equivalent assessments from our previous study.There was a small and not statistically significant increase from 81.0% to 85.5% in the percentage of records that provided a name of a contact person. There was a significant increase from 68.7% to 74.9% in the number of records that provided either an email address or a telephone number. There was a significant increase from 44.2% to 51.9% in the number of intervention arms that were complete in registering intervention specifics. There was a significant increase from 38.2% to 57.6% in the number of primary outcomes that were specific measures with a meaningful timeframe. Approximately half of all trials continued to be retrospectively registered.There have been small but significant improvements in the quality of registration since 2009. Important problems with quality remain and continue to constitute an impediment to the meaningful utilization of registered trial information."

Using quantitative PCR-based measurements of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage, mtDNA damage was preferentially noted in AEC after exposure to oxidative stress (e.g. amosite asbestos (5–25 μg/cm2) or H2O2 (100–250 μm)) for 24 h.

In contrast, compared with controls, knockdown of Ogg1 (using Ogg1 shRNA in A549 cells or primary alveolar type 2 cells from ogg1−/− mice) augmented mtDNA lesions and intrinsic apoptosis at base line, and these effects were increased further after exposure to oxidative stress.

Aco-2, one of the enzymes participating in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), acts as a biosensor for oxidative stress and preserves mtDNA in yeast independent of Aco-2 activity (20.Bulteau A.L.

However, the role of mtDNA damage in triggering AEC apoptosis as well as whether Aco-2 modulates mtDNA damage in eukaryotic cells (including AEC) are unknown. In this study we reasoned that preservation of mtDNA by mitochondria-targeted hOgg1 and/or Aco-2 is necessary for preventing oxidant (amosite asbestos or H2O2)-induced AEC mitochondrial dysfunction, p53 translocation to the mitochondria, and intrinsic apoptosis. Using a quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR)-based mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage assay, we show that oxidative stress induces preferential mtDNA damage in AEC. Furthermore, using hOgg1 and Aco-2 over- and underexpression conditions, we establish that both hOgg1 and Aco-2 are important in limiting oxidant-induced mtDNA damage and subsequent p53 mitochondrial translocation and intrinsic apoptosis. Intriguingly, primary AT2 cells from ogg1−/− mice have reduced Aco-2 expression and increased levels of mtDNA lesions and intrinsic apoptosis under untreated conditions as compared with wild-type AT2 cells, and these deleterious effects are further enhanced after exposure to oxidative stress. Finally, we show that siRNA against Aco-2 alters the protective effects of mt-hOgg1-Mut but not mt-hOgg1-WT against oxidant-induced mtDNA damage and apoptosis. Collectively, these findings establish a novel role for mt-hOgg1 and Aco-2 in preserving AEC mtDNA integrity that prevents downstream mitochondrial dysfunction, p53 activation, and intrinsic apoptosis.

Genomic DNA, including both nuclear and mtDNA, was assessed by Q-PCR as described elsewhere (23.Santos J.H. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Measuring oxidative mtDNA damage and repair using quantitative PCR.Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 197: 159-176PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen Genomic-tip 20/G and Qiagen DNA Buffer Set (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) per the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were incubated in a lysis buffer containing RNase A (Invitrogen) and proteinase K (Qiagen) for 2 h. Total DNA contained in the extracts is bound to Qiagen Genomic-tip 20/G columns, washed, and eluted. Eluted DNA was incubated with isopropyl alcohol at −80 °C overnight and centrifuged 12,000 × g for 60 min. To wash DNA, we evenly added 0.7 ml (70%) of ethanol to each aliquot and centrifuged samples at 9500 − g for 30 min. After removing the supernatant, Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 7.5) was added the each tube, and the DNA concentration was measured. PCR was performed using Ex-taq (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) with specific primers (Table 1) to amplify a fragment of the mitochondrial genome, both a short and long fragment and nuclear DNA (β-globulin) as described (23.Santos J.H. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Measuring oxidative mtDNA damage and repair using quantitative PCR.Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 197: 159-176PubMed Google Scholar). Each DNA was quantified by Pico-green (Invitrogen) using the FL600 Microplate Fluorescence Reader parameters excitation and emission wavelengths 485 and 530 nm. Then the data were obtained from the small fragment were subsequently used to normalize the results of the mitochondrial long fragment (23.Santos J.H. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B.

Apoptosis was also determined by flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V staining using an APC Annexin V kit (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, the cells were washed twice using cold PBS and then resuspended in 1× binding buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. 1 × 105 cells were transferred to a new test tube, and 5 μl of APC Annexin V was added for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. 400 μl of 1× binding buffer with 3 μm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI, Invitrogen) were added to each tube. At the end of the incubation, the cells were analyzed by a FACSAria 4-Laser (BD Pharmingen). The values were determined with H2O2-induced A549 cells and are described under “Results” (n = 3).

Proteins were resolved in 4∼20% acrylamide gel (Bio-Rad), transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with specific antibodies. Membranes were developed with an ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). The antibodies for Western blotting included polyclonal antibodies directed against hOgg1 (Novus Biological, Cambridge, UK), mitochondrial aconitase (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), cleaved caspase-9 (Cell Signaling Technology), and cytochrome oxidase IV (Cell Signaling Technology). Anti-GAPDH, c-Myc, and p53 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. The protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) and quantified by densitometry using Eagle Eye software (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The results of each experimental condition were determined from the mean of duplicate-triplicate trials. Data was expressed as the means ± S.E. (n = 3 unless otherwise stated). A two-tailed Student's t test was used to assess the significance of differences between two groups. Analysis of variance was used when comparing more than two groups; differences between two groups within the set were analyzed by a Fisher's protected least significant differences test as well as Tukey tests. Probability values <0.05 were considered significant. To investigate the effect of oxidative stress (asbestos or H2O2) on AEC DNA damage, we used a Q-PCR-based measurement of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage. We found that mtDNA lesions in A549 cells are increased in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to asbestos (5–25 μg/cm2) or H2O2 (100–250 μm) over 24 h (Fig. 1A). Oxidative stress also induced mtDNA damage in primary isolated murine AT2, MLE-12, and RLE-6TN rat AT2 cells, although the levels of mtDNA lesions were less than that noted in A549 cells (Fig. 1A). Increased mtDNA lesions after exposure to asbestos or H2O2 corresponded with slightly reduced mtDNA copy number in all four AEC (Fig. 1B). Notably, negligible levels of nuclear DNA damage to β-globulin (human and mice) or clusterin (rat) were detected in these AEC after asbestos or H2O2 exposure over 24 h (Fig. 1). These data show that oxidative stress from either asbestos or H2O2 induces greater levels of mtDNA as compared with nuclear DNA damage in various types of AEC. Previous studies have established that mitochondrial-targeted mt-hOgg1-WT prevents oxidant-induced apoptosis in part by augmenting repair of mtDNA damage, but a similar role in AEC is unclear (8.Dobson A.W.

We aimed to describe the frequency of and factors associated with breathlessness in a cohort of COPD patients identified from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a general practice electronic medical records database.Patients with a record of COPD diagnosis after January 1 2008 were identified in the CPRD. Breathlessness was assessed using the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale, with scoring ranging from 1-5, which has been routinely administered as a part of the regular assessment of patients with COPD in the general practice since April 2009. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression estimated independent associations with dyspnoea. Negative binomial regression evaluated a relationship between breathlessness and exacerbation rate during follow-up.The total cohort comprised 49,438 patients diagnosed with COPD; 40,425 (82%) had any MRC dyspnoea grade recorded. Of those, 22,770 (46%) had moderate-to-severe dyspnoea (MRC ≥ 3). Breathlessness increased with increasing airflow limitation; however, moderate-to-severe dyspnoea was also observed in 32% of patients with mild airflow obstruction. Other factors associated with increased dyspnoea grade included female gender, older age (≥ 70 years), obesity (BMI ≥ 30), history of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations, and frequent visits to the general practitioner. Patients with worse breathlessness were at higher risk of COPD exacerbations during follow-up.Moderate-to-severe dyspnoea was reported by >40% of patients diagnosed with COPD in primary care. Presence of dyspnoea, including even a perception of mild dyspnoea (MRC = 2), was associated with increased disease severity and a higher risk of COPD exacerbations during follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2100750612,"Human activity has been shown to considerably affect the spread of dangerous pests and pathogens worldwide. Therefore, strict regulations of international trade exist for particularly harmful pathogenic organisms. Phytophthora plurivora, which is not subject to regulations, is a plant pathogen frequently found on a broad range of host species, both in natural and artificial environments. It is supposed to be native to Europe while resident populations are also present in the US. We characterized a hierarchical sample of isolates from Europe and the US and conducted coalescent-, migration, and population genetic analysis of sequence and microsatellite data, to determine the pathways of spread and the demographic history of this pathogen. We found P. plurivora populations to be moderately diverse but not geographically structured. High levels of gene flow were observed within Europe and unidirectional from Europe to the US. Coalescent analyses revealed a signal of a recent expansion of the global P. plurivora population. Our study shows that P. plurivora has most likely been spread around the world by nursery trade of diseased plant material. In particular, P. plurivora was introduced into the US from Europe. International trade has allowed the pathogen to colonize new environments and/or hosts, resulting in population growth."
https://openalex.org/W1967734782,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines represent the most commonly used mammalian expression system for the production of therapeutic proteins. In this context, detailed knowledge of the CHO cell transcriptome might help to improve biotechnological processes conducted by specific cell lines. Nevertheless, very few assembled cDNA sequences of CHO cells were publicly released until recently, which puts a severe limitation on biotechnological research. Two extended annotation systems and web-based tools, one for browsing eukaryotic genomes (GenDBE) and one for viewing eukaryotic transcriptomes (SAMS), were established as the first step towards a publicly usable CHO cell genome/transcriptome analysis platform. This is complemented by the development of a new strategy to assemble the ca. 100 million reads, sequenced from a broad range of diverse transcripts, to a high quality CHO cell transcript set. The cDNA libraries were constructed from different CHO cell lines grown under various culture conditions and sequenced using Roche/454 and Illumina sequencing technologies in addition to sequencing reads from a previous study. Two pipelines to extend and improve the CHO cell line transcripts were established. First, de novo assemblies were carried out with the Trinity and Oases assemblers, using varying k-mer sizes. The resulting contigs were screened for potential CDS using ESTScan. Redundant contigs were filtered out using cd-hit-est. The remaining CDS contigs were re-assembled with CAP3. Second, a reference-based assembly with the TopHat/Cufflinks pipeline was performed, using the recently published draft genome sequence of CHO-K1 as reference. Additionally, the de novo contigs were mapped to the reference genome using GMAP and merged with the Cufflinks assembly using the cuffmerge software. With this approach 28,874 transcripts located on 16,492 gene loci could be assembled. Combining the results of both approaches, 65,561 transcripts were identified for CHO cell lines, which could be clustered by sequence identity into 17,598 gene clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2050386368,"Glycerol dehydrogenase (GDH) is an important polyol dehydrogenase for glycerol metabolism in diverse microorganisms and for value-added utilization of glycerol in the industry. Two GDHs from Klebsiella pneumoniae, DhaD and GldA, were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized for substrate specificity and kinetic parameters. Both DhaD and GldA could catalyze the interconversion of (3R)-acetoin/(2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol or (3S)-acetoin/meso-2,3-butanediol, in addition to glycerol oxidation. Although purified GldA appeared more active than DhaD, in vivo inactivation and quantitation of their respective mRNAs indicate that dhaD is highly induced by glycerol and plays a dual role in glycerol metabolism and 2,3-butanediol formation. Complementation in K. pneumoniae further confirmed the dual role of DhaD. Promiscuity of DhaD may have vital physiological consequences for K. pneumoniae growing on glycerol, which include balancing the intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio, preventing acidification, and storing carbon and energy. According to the kinetic response of DhaD to modified NADH concentrations, DhaD appears to show positive homotropic interaction with NADH, suggesting that the physiological role could be regulated by intracellular NADH levels. The co-existence of two functional GDH enzymes might be due to a gene duplication event. We propose that whereas DhaD is specialized for glycerol utilization, GldA plays a role in backup compensation and can turn into a more proficient catalyst to promote a survival advantage to the organism.

https://openalex.org/W1985032406,"Sudden cardiac death is often caused by cardiac arrhythmias. Recently, special attention has been given to a certain arrhythmogenic condition, the long-QT syndrome, which occurs as a result of genetic mutations or drug toxicity. The underlying mechanisms of arrhythmias, caused by the long-QT syndrome, are not fully understood. However, arrhythmias are often connected to special excitations of cardiac cells, called early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which are depolarizations during the repolarizing phase of the action potential. So far, EADs have been studied mainly in isolated cardiac cells. However, the question on how EADs at the single-cell level can result in fibrillation at the tissue level, especially in human cell models, has not been widely studied yet. In this paper, we study wave patterns that result from single-cell EAD dynamics in a mathematical model for human ventricular cardiac tissue. We induce EADs by modeling experimental conditions which have been shown to evoke EADs at a single-cell level: by an increase of L-type Ca currents and a decrease of the delayed rectifier potassium currents. We show that, at the tissue level and depending on these parameters, three types of abnormal wave patterns emerge. We classify them into two types of spiral fibrillation and one type of oscillatory dynamics. Moreover, we find that the emergent wave patterns can be driven by calcium or sodium currents and we find phase waves in the oscillatory excitation regime. From our simulations we predict that arrhythmias caused by EADs can occur during normal wave propagation and do not require tissue heterogeneities. Experimental verification of our results is possible for experiments at the cell-culture level, where EADs can be induced by an increase of the L-type calcium conductance and by the application of I blockers, and the properties of the emergent patterns can be studied by optical mapping of the voltage and calcium."
https://openalex.org/W2066445150,"Background Wnt proteins are conserved signaling molecules that regulate pattern formation during animal development. Many Wnt proteins are post-translationally modified by addition of lipid adducts. Wnt8a provides a crucial signal for patterning the anteroposterior axis of the developing neural plate in vertebrates. However, it is not clear how this protein propagates from its source, the blastoderm margin, to the target cells in the prospective neural plate, and how lipid-modifications might influence Wnt8a propagation and activity. Results We have dynamically imaged biologically active, fluorescently tagged Wnt8a in living zebrafish embryos. We find that Wnt8a localizes to membrane-associated, punctate structures in live tissue. In Wnt8a expressing cells, these puncta are found on filopodial cellular processes, from where the protein can be released. In addition, Wnt8a is found colocalized with Frizzled receptor-containing clusters on signal receiving cells. Combining in vitro and in vivo assays, we compare the roles of conserved Wnt8a residues in cell and non-cell-autonomous signaling activity and secretion. Non-signaling Wnt8 variants show these residues can regulate Wnt8a distribution in producing cell membranes and filopodia as well as in the receiving tissue. Conclusions Together, our results show that Wnt8a forms dynamic clusters found on filopodial donor cell and on signal receiving cell membranes. Moreover, they demonstrate a differential requirement of conserved residues in Wnt8a protein for distribution in producing cells and receiving tissue and signaling activity during neuroectoderm patterning."
https://openalex.org/W2058195401,"In December 2010, the highest recorded Queensland rainfall associated with Tropical Cyclone 'Tasha' caused flooding of the Fitzroy River in Queensland, Australia. A massive flood plume inundated coral reefs lying 12 km offshore of the Central Queensland coast near Yeppoon and caused 40-100% mortality to coral fringing many of the islands of Keppel Bay down to a depth of ∼8 m. The severity of coral mortality was influenced by the level of exposure to low salinity seawater as a result of the reef's distance from the flood plume and to a lesser extent, water depth and whether or not the reef faced the plume source. There was no evidence in this study of mortality resulting from pollutants derived from the nearby Fitzroy Catchment, at least in the short term, suggesting that during a major flood, the impact of low salinity on corals outweighs that of pollutants. Recovery of the reefs in Keppel Bay from the 2010/2011 Fitzroy River flood is likely to take 10-15 years based on historical recovery periods from a similar event in 1991; potentially impacting visitor numbers for tourism and recreational usage. In the meantime, activities like snorkeling, diving and coral viewing will be focused on the few shallow reefs that survived the flood, placing even further pressure on their recovery. Reef regeneration, restoration and rehabilitation are measures that may be needed to support tourism in the short term. However, predictions of a warming climate, lower rainfall and higher intensity summer rain events in the Central and Coastal regions of Australia over the next decade, combined with the current anthropogenic influences on water quality, are likely to slow regeneration with consequent impact on long-term reef resilience."
https://openalex.org/W2062214460,"Toxoplasmosis has been recognized as parasitic zoonosis with the highest human incidence. The human infection by the parasite can lead to severe clinical manifestations in congenital toxoplasmosis and immunocompromised patients. Contamination occurs mainly by foodborne ways especially consumption of raw or undercooked meat. In contrast to other foodborne infections, toxoplasmosis is a chronic infection which would make its economic and social impact much higher than even previously anticipated. Ovine meat was advanced as a major risk factor, so we investigated its parasite survey, under natural conditions. Serological MAT technique and touchdown PCR approaches were used for prevalence determination of the parasite in slaughtered sheep intended to human consumption in Tunis City. The genotyping was carried by SNPs analysis of SAG3 marker. Anti-Toxoplasma antibodies were present in 38.2% of young sheep and in 73.6% of adult sheep. Molecular detection revealed the contamination of 50% of ewes' tissue. Sequencing and SNPs analysis enabled unambiguous typing of meat isolates and revealed the presence of mixed strains as those previously identified from clinical samples in the same area. Our findings conclude that slaughtered sheep are highly infected, suggesting them as a major risk factor of Toxoplasma gondii transmission by meat consumption. Special aware should target consequently this factor when recommendations have to be established by the health care commanders."

Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HF-induced muscle atrophy may contribute to the development of pharmacological strategies to prevent or treat such condition. It has been shown that autophagy-lysosome system is an important mechanism for maintenance of muscle mass. However, its role in HF-induced myopathy has not been addressed yet. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate autophagy signaling in myocardial infarction (MI)-induced muscle atrophy in rats.Wistar rats underwent MI or Sham surgeries, and after 12 weeks were submitted to echocardiography, exercise tolerance and histology evaluations. Cathepsin L activity and expression of autophagy-related genes and proteins were assessed in soleus and plantaris muscles by fluorimetric assay, qRT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. MI rats displayed exercise intolerance, left ventricular dysfunction and dilation, thereby suggesting the presence of HF. The key findings of the present study were: a) upregulation of autophagy-related genes (GABARAPL1, ATG7, BNIP3, CTSL1 and LAMP2) was observed only in plantaris while muscle atrophy was observed in both soleus and plantaris muscles, and b) Cathepsin L activity, Bnip3 and Fis1 protein levels, and levels of lipid hydroperoxides were increased specifically in plantaris muscle of MI rats.Altogether our results provide evidence for autophagy signaling regulation in HF-induced plantaris atrophy but not soleus atrophy. Therefore, autophagy-lysosome system is differentially regulated in atrophic muscles comprising different fiber-types and metabolic characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1980931112,"Sorcin, a protein overexpressed in many multi-drug resistant cancers, dynamically localizes to distinct subcellular sites in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts during cell-cycle progression. During interphase sorcin is in the nucleus, in the plasma membrane, in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternae, and in ER-derived vesicles localized along the microtubules. These vesicles are positive to RyR, SERCA, calreticulin and Rab10. At the beginning of mitosis, sorcin-containing vesicles associate with the mitotic spindle, and during telophase are concentrated in the cleavage furrow and, subsequently, in the midbody. Sorcin regulates dimensions and calcium load of the ER vesicles by inhibiting RYR and activating SERCA. Analysis of sorcin interactome reveals calcium-dependent interactions with many proteins, including Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), Aurora A and Aurora B kinases. Sorcin interacts physically with PLK1, is phosphorylated by PLK1 and induces PLK1 autophosphorylation, thereby regulating kinase activity. Knockdown of sorcin results in major defects in mitosis and cytokinesis, increase in the number of rounded polynucleated cells, blockage of cell progression in G2/M, apoptosis and cell death. Sorcin regulates calcium homeostasis and is necessary for the activation of mitosis and cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2019409408,"Scirrhous gastric carcinoma (SGC) has the worst prognosis of all gastric cancers, owing to its rapid expansion by invasion and frequent peritoneal dissemination. Due to the increased proliferation of stromal fibroblasts (SFs) that occurs within SGC lesions and the peritoneal metastatic sites, SFs have been proposed to support the progression of this disease. However, the biological and molecular basis and the pathological role of the intercellular interaction between SGC cells and SFs remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of SFs in the invasion of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by SGC cells. When SGC cells were cocultured with SFs derived from SGC tissue on three-dimensional (3D) Matrigel, they were attracted together to form large cellular aggregates that invaded within the Matrigel. Time-lapse imaging revealed that this process was associated with extensive contraction and remodeling of the ECM. Immunofluorescence and biochemical analysis showed that SGC cells stimulate phosphorylation of myosin light chain and actomyosin-mediated mechanical remodeling of the ECM by SFs. By utilizing this assay system for inhibitor library screening, we have identified several inhibitors that potently suppress the cooperation between SGC cells and SFs to form the invasive structures. Among them, a Src inhibitor dasatinib impaired the interaction between SGC cells and SFs both in vitro and in vivo and effectively blocked peritoneal dissemination of SGC cells. These results indicate that SFs mediate mechanical remodeling of the ECM by SGC cells, thereby promoting invasion and peritoneal dissemination of SGC."
https://openalex.org/W2068950874,"Background β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in brain's grey matter (GM) are one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and can be imaged in vivo using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with 11C or 18F radiotracers. Estimating Aβ burden in cortical GM has been shown to improve diagnosis and monitoring of AD. However, lacking structural information in PET images requires such assessments to be performed with anatomical MRI scans, which may not be available at different clinical settings or being contraindicated for particular reasons. This study aimed to develop an MR-less Aβ imaging quantification method that requires only PET images for reliable Aβ burden estimations. Materials and Methods The proposed method has been developed using a multi-atlas based approach on 11C-PiB scans from 143 subjects (75 PiB+ and 68 PiB- subjects) in AIBL study. A subset of 20 subjects (PET and MRI) were used as atlases: 1) MRI images were co-registered with tissue segmentation; 2) 3D surface at the GM-WM interfacing was extracted and registered to a canonical space; 3) Mean PiB retention within GM was estimated and mapped to the surface. For other participants, each atlas PET image (and surface) was registered to the subject's PET image for PiB estimation within GM. The results are combined by subject-specific atlas selection and Bayesian fusion to generate estimated surface values. Results All PiB+ subjects (N = 75) were highly correlated between the MR-dependent and the PET-only methods with Intraclass Correlation (ICC) of 0.94, and an average relative difference error of 13% (or 0.23 SUVR) per surface vertex. All PiB- subjects (N = 68) revealed visually akin patterns with a relative difference error of 16% (or 0.19 SUVR) per surface vertex. Conclusion The demonstrated accuracy suggests that the proposed method could be an effective clinical inspection tool for Aβ imaging scans when MRI images are unavailable."
https://openalex.org/W1996852865,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a natural bioactive lipid that acts through six different G protein-coupled receptors (LPA1–6) with pleiotropic activities on multiple cell types. We have previously demonstrated that LPA is necessary for successful in vitro osteoclastogenesis of bone marrow cells. Bone cells controlling bone remodeling (i.e. osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes) express LPA1, but delineating the role of this receptor in bone remodeling is still pending. Despite Lpar1−/− mice displaying a low bone mass phenotype, we demonstrated that bone marrow cell-induced osteoclastogenesis was reduced in Lpar1−/− mice but not in Lpar2−/− and Lpar3−/− animals. Expression of LPA1 was up-regulated during osteoclastogenesis, and LPA1 antagonists (Ki16425, Debio0719, and VPC12249) inhibited osteoclast differentiation. Blocking LPA1 activity with Ki16425 inhibited expression of nuclear factor of activated T-cell cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) and dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein and interfered with the fusion but not the proliferation of osteoclast precursors. Similar to wild type osteoclasts treated with Ki16425, mature Lpar1−/− osteoclasts had reduced podosome belt and sealing zone resulting in reduced mineralized matrix resorption. Additionally, LPA1 expression markedly increased in the bone of ovariectomized mice, which was blocked by bisphosphonate treatment. Conversely, systemic treatment with Debio0719 prevented ovariectomy-induced cancellous bone loss. Moreover, intravital multiphoton microscopy revealed that Debio0719 reduced the retention of CX3CR1-EGFP+ osteoclast precursors in bone by increasing their mobility in the bone marrow cavity. Overall, our results demonstrate that LPA1 is essential for in vitro and in vivo osteoclast activities. Therefore, LPA1 emerges as a new target for the treatment of diseases associated with excess bone loss.

https://openalex.org/W2077001869,"Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most frequent cause of genetic Parkinson’s disease (PD). The biological function of LRRK2 and how mutations lead to disease remain poorly defined. It has been proposed that LRRK2 could function in gene transcription regulation; however, this issue remains controversial. Here, we investigated in parallel gene and microRNA (miRNA) transcriptome profiles of three different LRRK2 mouse models. Striatal tissue was isolated from adult LRRK2 knockout (KO) mice, as well as mice expressing human LRRK2 wildtype (hLRRK2-WT) or the PD-associated R1441G mutation (hLRRK2-R1441G). We identified a total of 761 genes and 24 miRNAs that were misregulated in the absence of LRRK2 when a false discovery rate of 0.2 was applied. Notably, most changes in gene expression were modest (i.e., <2 fold). By real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed the variations of selected genes (e.g., adra2, syt2, opalin) and miRNAs (e.g., miR-16, miR-25). Surprisingly, little or no changes in gene expression were observed in mice expressing hLRRK2-WT or hLRRK2-R1441G when compared to non-transgenic controls. Nevertheless, a number of miRNAs were misexpressed in these models. Bioinformatics analysis identified several miRNA-dependent and independent networks dysregulated in LRRK2-deficient mice, including PD-related pathways. These results suggest that brain LRRK2 plays an overall modest role in gene transcription regulation in mammals; however, these effects seem context and RNA type-dependent. Our data thus set the stage for future investigations regarding LRRK2 function in PD development."
https://openalex.org/W2086056625,"Background A novel injectable cement composed of chitosan-bonded borate bioactive glass (BG) particles was evaluated as a carrier for local delivery of vancomycin in the treatment of osteomyelitis in a rabbit tibial model. Materials and Methods The setting time, injectability, and compressive strength of the borate BG cement, and the release profile of vancomycin from the cement were measured in vitro. The capacity of the vancomycin-loaded BG cement to eradicate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-induced osteomyelitis in rabbit tibiae in vivo was evaluated and compared with that for a vancomycin-loaded calcium sulfate (CS) cement and for intravenous injection of vancomycin. Results The BG cement had an injectability of >90% during the first 3 minutes after mixing, hardened within 30 minutes and, after hardening, had a compressive strength of 18±2 MPa. Vancomycin was released from the BG cement into phosphate-buffered saline for up to 36 days, and the cumulative amount of vancomycin released was 86% of the amount initially loaded into the cement. In comparison, vancomycin was released from the CS cement for up 28 days and the cumulative amount released was 89%. Two months post-surgery, radiography and microbiological tests showed that the BG and CS cements had a better ability to eradicate osteomyelitis when compared to intravenous injection of vancomycin, but there was no significant difference between the BG and CS cements in eradicating the infection. Histological examination showed that the BG cement was biocompatible and had a good capacity for regenerating bone in the tibial defects. Conclusions These results indicate that borate BG cement is a promising material both as an injectable carrier for vancomycin in the eradication of osteomyelitis and as an osteoconductive matrix to regenerate bone after the infection is cured."
https://openalex.org/W1989750250,"The local neighborhood forms an integral part of our lives. It provides the context through which social networks are nurtured and the foundation from which a sense of attachment and cohesion with fellow residents can be established. Whereas much of the previous research has examined the role of social and demographic characteristic in relation to the level of neighboring and cohesion, this paper explores whether particular environmental features in the neighborhood affect social porosity. We define social porosity as the degree to which social ties flow over the surface of a neighborhood. The focus of our paper is to examine the extent to which a neighborhood's environmental features impede the level of social porosity present among residents. To do this, we integrate data from the census, topographic databases and a 2010 survey of 4,351 residents from 146 neighborhoods in Australia. The study introduces the concepts of wedges and social holes. The presence of two sources of wedges is measured: rivers and highways. The presence of two sources of social holes is measured: parks and industrial areas. Borrowing from the geography literature, several measures are constructed to capture how these features collectively carve up the physical environment of neighborhoods. We then consider how this influences residents' neighboring behavior, their level of attachment to the neighborhood and their sense of neighborhood cohesion. We find that the distance of a neighborhood to one form of social hole–industrial areas–has a particularly strong negative effect on all three dependent variables. The presence of the other form of social hole–parks–has a weaker negative effect. Neighborhood wedges also impact social interaction. Both the length of a river and the number of highway fragments in a neighborhood has a consistent negative effect on neighboring, attachment and cohesion."

Therefore, it is important to evaluate their effects on key endocrine pathways in adipose tissue (AT), to further evaluate their potential role in metabolic pathologies such as obesity.THE AIM IS TWOFOLD: (i) evaluate gene expression levels of obesity marker genes, i.e. the adipokines leptin (LEP), adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) and the nuclear receptor, Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor γ (PPARγ) in paired subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) AT of obese subjects (n = 50) and to relate these values to serum concentrations of LEP and ADIPOQ (ii) evaluate the association of expression levels of marker genes in AT and serum with POP concentrations in AT.Leptin and adiponectin levels in serum were positively correlated to respectively expression levels of leptin in SAT and adiponectin in VAT. Our study shows more significant correlations between gene expression of obesity marker genes and POP concentrations in VAT compared to SAT. Since VAT is more important than SAT in pathologies associated with obesity, this suggests that POPs are able to influence the association between obesity and the development of associated pathologies. Moreover, this finding reveals the importance of VAT when investigating the obesogen hypothesis. Concerning PPARγ expression in VAT, negative correlations with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) concentrations were found in non T2D patients. LEP serum concentrations correlated with several PCBs in women whereas in men no correlations were found. This strengthens the potential importance of gender differences in obesity and within the obesogen hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2047051113,"Fifty-one Simmental crossbred steers (357.0±16.5 kg) were used to compare a standard total mix ration (TMR) with variants on animal performance, ruminal fermentation, blood biochemical parameters, and carcass characteristics. Corn grain and cotton seed meal were partially replaced by ensiled mulberry leaves (EML) or sun-dried mulberry fruit pomace (SMFP). Experimental diets had similar amounts of crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and metabolizable energy (ME). Animals were divided into three groups: control group (CONT), 8% EML group, and 6.3% SMFP group. Performance, including average daily weight gain (ADG), and dry matter intake (DMI), was measured. Blood and rumen samples were collected at the end of the experiment (16 weeks). There were no differences in final body weight (P = 0.743), ADG (P = 0.425), DMI (P = 0.642), or ADG/DMI (P = 0.236) between the groups. There were no differences (P = 0.2024) in rumen pH values; ammonia N was lower (P = 0.0076) in SMFP than in the EML and CONT groups. There were differences in the concentrations of total and individual volatile fatty acids, while no differences were determined in blood biochemical parameters (i.e., plasma glucose, urea concentrations, triglycerides, total protein, insulin, IgG, alanine transaminase, and aspartate aminotransferase, P ≥ 0.098). No differences were observed in carcass characteristics (P ≥ 0.513), tenderness (P = 0.844), adipose and lean color values (P ≥ 0.149), and chemical composition (P ≥ 0.400); however, intramuscular fat was lower in the EML and SMFP groups compared to the CONT animals (P = 0.034). In conclusion, diets supplemented with these two mulberry products in an isocaloric and isonitrogenous manner have similar effects to corn grain and cotton seed meals on steer performance, blood biochemical parameters and carcass characteristics, with the exception of ruminal VFA concentrations and lower intramuscular fat content."
https://openalex.org/W2087487368,"Toxoplasma gondii is a highly prevalent obligate intracellular parasite of the phylum Apicomplexa, which also includes other parasites of clinical and/or veterinary importance, such as Plasmodium, Cryptosporidium, and Eimeria. Acute infection by Toxoplasma is hallmarked by rapid proliferation in its host cells and requires a significant synthesis of parasite membranes. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) is the second major phospholipid class in T. gondii. Here, we reveal that PtdEtn is produced in the parasite mitochondrion and parasitophorous vacuole by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and in the endoplasmic reticulum by fusion of CDP-ethanolamine and diacylglycerol. PtdEtn in the mitochondrion is synthesized by a phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (TgPSD1mt) of the type I class. TgPSD1mt harbors a targeting peptide at its N terminus that is required for the mitochondrial localization but not for the catalytic activity. Ablation of TgPSD1mt expression caused up to 45% growth impairment in the parasite mutant. The PtdEtn content of the mutant was unaffected, however, suggesting the presence of compensatory mechanisms. Indeed, metabolic labeling revealed an increased usage of ethanolamine for PtdEtn synthesis by the mutant. Likewise, depletion of nutrients exacerbated the growth defect (∼56%), which was partially restored by ethanolamine. Besides, the survival and residual growth of the TgPSD1mt mutant in the nutrient-depleted medium also indicated additional routes of PtdEtn biogenesis, such as acquisition of host-derived lipid.

Collectively, the work demonstrates a metabolic cooperativity between the parasite organelles, which ensures a sustained lipid synthesis, survival and growth of T. gondii in varying nutritional milieus. Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that causes cerebral and ocular toxoplasmosis in immunosuppressed individuals as well as congenital disease and abortions in animals and humans. It can infect and replicate in nearly all nucleated vertebrate cells and thus poses a major threat to global health. Besides that, the parasite serves as a model organism to understand the biology of parasitic and free living protozoa. Successful infection and transmission of T. gondii depends on the interconversion between its fast replicating tachyzoite and dormant bradyzoite stages. The lytic cycle begins with the infection of host cells by tachyzoites, which cause tissue necrosis and acute infection (1Black M.W. Boothroyd J.C. Lytic cycle of Toxoplasma gondii.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Upon immune and physicochemical stress (pH, temperature, etc.), tachyzoites convert into bradyzoite-containing cysts (chronic infection) (2Sullivan Jr., W.J. Jeffers V. Mechanisms of Toxoplasma gondii persistence and latency.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2012; 36: 717-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Such cysts are commonly formed in the neural and muscular tissues and persist for the entire life of the infected host (2Sullivan Jr., W.J. Jeffers V. Mechanisms of Toxoplasma gondii persistence and latency.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2012; 36: 717-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The promiscuous parasitism of T. gondii in assorted niches necessitates a discretionary access to host resources and fine tuning of the parasite's metabolism. The parasite resides in a parasitophorous vacuole, which provides a safe environment and interface for acquisition of nutrients. The rapid replication of intracellular tachyzoites and concomitant expansion of the parasitophorous vacuole are accompanied by significant membrane synthesis and nutritional import from the host cell (3Coppens I. Targeting lipid biosynthesis and salvage in apicomplexan parasites for improved chemotherapies.Nature reviews. Microbiology. 2013; 11: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

In the second step, the partial ORF (53–2904 bp) containing a C-terminal HA tag was cloned at the MscI and PacI restriction sites. Finally, the 3′-UTR of the TgNTP3 gene was inserted using PacI and NotI (primers in Table 1). Bacterial clones were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The plasmid constructs were transfected into fresh extracellular tachyzoites (Δku80-TaTi or Δku80-hxgprt−) suspended in Cytomix (10 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, 25 mm HEPES, 120 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm glutathione, 5 mm ATP, pH 7.6) using the BTX electroporation instrument (50 μg of DNA, ∼107 parasites, 2 kV, 50 ohms, 25 microfarads, 250 μs). All UPKO-based vectors allow a targeted insertion of the ORF of interest at the TgUPRT (uracil phosphoribosyltransferase) locus following a selection by 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (20Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Insertional mutagenesis and marker rescue in a protozoan parasite. Cloning of the uracil phosphoribosyltransferase locus from Toxoplasma gondii.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 5749-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Parasites with a disrupted UPRT gene locus were selected by 5 μm 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine. Transgenic tachyzoites were transformed with the TgDer1-GFP construct (18Agrawal S. van Dooren G.G. Beatty W.L. Striepen B.

The knock-out vector used to generate a conditional mutant contained the 5′- and 3′-UTR of the TgPSD1mt gene flanking a dihydrofolate reductase thymidylate synthase selection marker (pTKO-TgPSD1mt-5′UTR-DHFR-TS-TgPSD1mt-3′UTR). The UTRs were amplified from tachyzoite gDNA using the indicated primers (Table 1). The 5′-UTR (1 kb) and 3′-UTR (1 kb) were cloned into XcmI/SpeI and HpaI/ApaI restriction sites, respectively. The knock-out plasmid was transfected into the 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine-resistant parasites of the Δku80-TaTi strain expressing an ectopic copy of tetracycline-regulatable TgPSD1mt-HAr, and selected with 1 μm pyrimethamine (21Donald R.G.

The direct knock-out plasmid (pTKO-TgPSD1mt-5′UTR-HXGPRT-TgPSD1mt-3′UTR) consisted of 5′- and 3′-UTR elements (3 kb each) cloned at the KpnI/XhoI and HpaI/ApaI sites flanking the hypoxanthine xanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HXGPRT) resistance cassette (22Donald R.G.

The vector was transfected into the Δku80-hxgprt− strain followed by transgenic selection using mycophenolic acid (25 μg/ml) and xanthine (50 μg/ml) (22Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S.

The drug-resistant parasites were cloned by limiting dilution and tested by crossover-specific PCR (primers in Table 1). For 3′-insertional tagging (3′IT) of the TgPSD1mt gene with a C-terminal HA tag, its 1.3-kb crossover sequence fused to the epitope was amplified from tachyzoite gDNA and digested with XcmI and HpaI. It was cloned into XcmI/EcoRI-digested pTKO-HXGPRT vector, finally eliminating the EcoRI cloning site. The pTKO-HXGPRT-TgPSD1mt-3′IT construct was linearized by EcoRI present in the first half of the crossover sequence, transfected into the Δku80-hxgprt− strain (17Huynh M.H. Carruthers V.B. Tagging of endogenous genes in a Toxoplasma gondii strain lacking Ku80.Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), and then selected for HXGPRT expression, as described above. The resulting strain expressed TgPSD1mt-HA under the control of its endogenous promoter and the TgGRA2–3′UTR. Parasite-infected HFF monolayers cultured on glass coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 24–30 h postinfection, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min), and then neutralized with 0.1 m glycine, PBS (5 min). Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, PBS for 20 min, and nonspecific binding was blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in 0.2% Triton X-100, PBS (30 min). Samples were stained using anti-HA (1:1000; mouse), anti-TgGap45 (1:3000; rabbit), or anti-TgF1B (1:1000; mouse) antibodies for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with 0.2% Triton X-100, PBS and stained with Alexa488- or Alexa594-conjugated antibodies (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse; 1:3000) for 45 min. Following three additional washing steps, samples were mounted in fluoromount G/DAPI (SouthernBiotech) and stored at 4 °C. Images were obtained using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Fresh extracellular tachyzoites (∼3 × 107) were washed with PBS and pelleted (400 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The parasite pellet was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed in 10 mm MOPS/KOH buffer containing 250 mm sucrose and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.2). The samples were probe-sonicated on ice (3× 30-s burst) followed by centrifugation (2000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was centrifuged (30,000 × g, 1 h), and the resulting membrane pellet was suspended in 1% Triton X-100 and 2× sample loading buffer for SDS-PAGE. The immunoblot was probed with anti-HA (1:1000; rabbit; 2 h) or anti-TgHsp90 (1:1000; rabbit; 2 h) as primary antibody and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary (1:20,000; 1 h) antibody. The growth fitness of tachyzoites was examined by plaque assays, recapitulating successive rounds of lytic cycles (i.e. invasion, replication, and egression). Confluent HFF cells in 6-well plates were infected with 200–400 parasites/well. The parasitized host cells were incubated in standard culture medium with 10% FCS for 7 days without perturbation (37 °C, 5% CO2). Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with ice-cold methanol (2 min), and stained with crystal violet (10 min). To set up nutrient-depleted assays, normal FCS was replaced by dialyzed (PAA) or by lipid-depleted FCS (Biowest), as indicated, at the time of infection. The plaques were imaged and quantified using the ImageJ suite (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). To determine parasite replication, confluent HFF cells cultured on coverslips in 24-well plates were infected with tachyzoites (MOI = 1), incubated for 12–60 h, fixed, and then immunostained using anti-TgGap45 antibody (1:3000; rabbit). The mean numbers of parasites per vacuole were scored to compare the replication rates of the strains. Yeast cells were grown in 2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2% glucose or in synthetic uracil-free minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base; Difco) supplemented with appropriate amino acids and 2% glucose. The S. cerevisiae psd1Δpsd2Δ mutants (BY23480 and PTY44) were transformed with the constructs expressing TgPSD1mt, TgPSD1mtΔmtp, or ScPSD1. The TgPSD1mt and TgPSD1mtΔmtp TgPSD1mt(91–427) and TgPSD1mt(113–427) cDNAs were cloned from parasite mRNA, and ScPSD1 ORF was cloned from yeast gDNA (primers in Table 1). The ORFs were ligated into pYES2.1 (Invitrogen) or pESC-Ura (Agilent Technologies) vectors expressing the URA3 gene for selecting yeast transformants in uracil-deficient medium. Both plasmids allow galactose-inducible expression of a protein of interest under the control of the GAL promoter of S. cerevisiae. Transformation was performed using standard yeast protocols. Transgenic cells were grown in synthetic uracil-dropout minimal medium supplemented with 2 mm ethanolamine and 2% glucose at 30 °C, and positive clones were identified by PCR and sequencing. For complementation assays, yeast cells were grown in liquid medium to an A600 of ∼0.1, and serial dilutions (1:5) were stamped or spotted on synthetic uracil-dropout plates containing either glucose, galactose, or lactate (2%) with or without ethanolamine (2 mm). Plates were incubated for 2–3 days at 30 °C. For plasmid loss, yeast cells were serially propagated for 5 days under nonselective conditions (2% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2% glucose) and evaluated by replica plating on selective (uracil-free) and nonselective (uracil-replete) plates in synthetic minimal medium. They were also examined for their ability to grow with or without ethanolamine. Yeast cells were grown to A600 = 0.4–0.8 in synthetic uracil-dropout medium supplemented with 2 mm ethanolamine and 2% galactose. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were washed once with double-distilled H2O and suspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing EDTA (3 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (0.5 mm), and sucrose (0.25 m). Cell extract was prepared by disrupting yeast cells with glass beads (0.5-mm diameter) using a bead beater (Biospec Products) and removing the beads and cell debris by centrifugation (2000 × g, 5 min). Crude mitochondrial preparation was obtained by centrifuging cell extract (10,000 × g, 10 min) and two washes with buffer. The resulting supernatant was used to obtain the microsomes and cytosolic fractions (100,000 × g, 1 h). Yeast cells expressing ScPSD1 (positive control) (10Trotter P.J. Voelker D.R.

The reaction samples were prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) buffer containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, and standard protease inhibitors. PSD activity was determined by trapping 14CO2 released from Ptd[1-14C]Ser on filter paper saturated with 2 m KOH (23Dowhan W. Wickner W.T. Kennedy E.P.

Ptd[1-14C]Ser was made from l-[1-14C]serine and dioleoyl CDP-diacylglycerol using PtdSer synthase. PtdSer synthase was purified from E. coli strain JA-200 harboring the plasmid pPS3155 as described previously (24Ohta A. Waggoner K. Radominska-Pyrek A. Dowhan W.

Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 552-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed at 30 °C in 16 × 100-mm borosilicate tubes sealed with an air-tight rubber septum holding the KOH-saturated filter paper. The 0.8-ml assay mixture contained 60 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 0.17 m sucrose, 0.35 mm PMSF, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm dioleoyl Ptd[U-14C]Ser (0.1 μCi/μmol), and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The reactions were started with 0.2 ml of yeast fractions and terminated after 1 h by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.25 m H2SO4, introduced through the rubber septum using a hypodermic needle. The emitted 14CO2 was trapped for 1 h prior to recovering the filter paper for liquid scintillation spectrometry. The purification of fresh host-free tachyzoites and metabolic labeling were performed as described before (4Gupta N. Zahn M.M. Coppens I. Joiner K.A. Voelker D.R.

https://openalex.org/W1994321055,"The tetraspanins (TSPs) are a family of integral membrane proteins that are ubiquitously expressed at the surface of eukaryotic cells. TSPs mediate a range of processes at the surface of the plasma membrane by providing a scaffold for the assembly of protein complexes known as tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs). We report here the structure of the surface-exposed EC2 domain from Sm-TSP-2, a TSP from Schistosoma mansoni and one of the better prospects for the development of a vaccine against schistosomiasis. This is the first solution structure of this domain, and our investigations of its interactions with lipid micelles provide a general model for interactions between TSPs, membranes, and other proteins. Using chemical cross-linking, eight potential protein constituents of Sm-TSP-2-mediated TEMs were also identified. These include proteins important for membrane maintenance and repair, providing further evidence for the functional role of Sm-TSP-2- and Sm-TSP-2-mediated TEMs. The identification of calpain, Sm29, and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, themselves potential vaccine antigens, suggests that the Sm-TSP-2-mediated TEMs could be disrupted via multiple targets. The identification of further Sm-TSP-2-mediated TEM proteins increases the available candidates for multiplex vaccines and/or novel drugs targeting TEMs in the schistosome tegument."

This Gram-positive bacterium displays a set of virulence-associated surface proteins involved in the interaction with the host, such as adhesion to host cells, invasion of tissues, or subversion of the immune system. In this study, we characterized a cell wall-localized protein as an ecto-5′-nucleoside diphosphate phosphohydrolase (NudP) involved in the degradation of extracellular nucleotides which are central mediators of the immune response. Biochemical characterization of recombinant NudP revealed a Mn2+-dependent ecto-5′-nucleotidase activity on ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside 5′-mono- and 5′-diphosphates with a substrate specificity different from that of known orthologous enzymes. Deletion of the gene coding the housekeeping enzyme sortase A led to the release of NudP into the culture supernatant, confirming that this enzyme is anchored to the cell wall by its non-canonical LPXTN motif. The NudP ecto-5′-nucleotidase activity is reminiscent of the reactions performed by the mammalian ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 involved in regulating the extracellular level of ATP and adenosine. We further demonstrated that the absence of NudP activity decreases bacterial survival in mouse blood, a process dependent on extracellular adenosine. In vivo assays in animal models of infection showed that NudP activity is critical for virulence. These results demonstrate that Group B Streptococcus expresses a specific ecto-5′-nucleotidase necessary for its pathogenicity and highlight the diversity of reactions performed by this enzyme family. These results suggest that bacterial pathogens have developed specialized strategies to subvert the mammalian immune response controlled by the extracellular nucleotide signaling pathways.

Collagen degradation is an important step in the marine nitrogen cycle. However, the mechanism of marine collagen degradation is still largely unknown. Here, a novel subtilisin-like collagenolytic protease, myroicolsin, which is secreted by the deep sea bacterium Myroides profundi D25, was purified and characterized, and its collagenolytic mechanism was studied. Myroicolsin displays low identity (<30%) to previously characterized subtilisin-like proteases, and it contains a novel domain structure. Protein truncation indicated that the Pro secretion system C-terminal sorting domain in the precursor protein is involved in the cleavage of the N-propeptide, and the linker is required for protein folding during myroicolsin maturation. The C-terminal β-jelly roll domain did not bind insoluble collagen fiber, suggesting that myroicolsin may degrade collagen without the assistance of a collagen-binding domain. Myroicolsin had broad specificity for various collagens, especially fish-insoluble collagen. The favored residue at the P1 site was basic arginine. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, together with biochemical analyses, confirmed that collagen fiber degradation by myroicolsin begins with the hydrolysis of proteoglycans and telopeptides in collagen fibers and fibrils. Myroicolsin showed strikingly different cleavage patterns between native and denatured collagens. A collagen degradation model of myroicolsin was proposed based on our results.

The degradation of marine organic nitrogen is an important part of the global nitrogen cycle.

Repeta D.J. Pantoja S. Johnson C.G. Two chemically distinct pools of organic nitrogen accumulate in the ocean.Science. 2005; 308: 1007-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Deep sea sediments contain at least 25% of the global ocean nitrogen burial. Most PON in the sediments can be degraded by microorganisms into dissolved organic nitrogen, which can then participate in ocean nitrogen cycling (2.Brunnegård J. Grandel S. Ståhl H. Tengberg A.

Therefore, sedimentary PON degradation by microorganisms is an important step in ocean nitrogen cycling. Collagen is the most abundant fibrous protein in all higher organisms, including marine animals (4.Exposito J.Y. Valcourt U. Cluzel C. Lethias C. The fibrillar collagen family.Int. J. Mol.

Due to its tight, complicated structure and insolubility in water, collagen is resistant to common proteases and can only be degraded by a limited number of collagenolytic proteases. Collagen is therefore an important component of deep sea sedimentary PON, and its degradation by the extracellular collagenolytic proteases from various deep sea microorganisms is an important biological process for the release of fixed nitrogen into the global nitrogen cycle. The collagen monomer is composed of three helical polypeptide chains containing a repeating Gly-Xaa-Yaa sequence. Collagen monomers assemble into stable collagen fibrils in a parallel staggered arrangement, and various covalent cross-links within or between fibrils maintain the stability of the fibrillar structure (7.Kadler K.E.

Some subtilisin-like proteases from environmental and pathogenic microorganisms have been demonstrated to be collagenolytic proteases. The thermostable protease secreted by Geobacillus collagenovorans MO-1 was the first S8 collagenolytic protease to be studied (25.Okamoto M. Yonejima Y. Tsujimoto Y. Suzuki Y. Watanabe K. A thermostable collagenolytic protease with a very large molecular mass produced by thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain MO-1.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 57: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26.Itoi Y. Horinaka M. Tsujimoto Y. Matsui H. Watanabe K.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6572-6579Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Several subtilisin-like proteases with strong collagenolytic activity are secreted by the pathogens Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acanthamoeba spp. and may serve as targets for the development of therapeutic agents (27.Kim H.K. Ha Y.R. Yu H.S. Kong H.H. Chung D.I. Purification and characterization of a 33 kDa serine protease from Acanthamoeba lugdunensis KA/E2 isolated from a Korean keratitis patient.Korean J.

Deseasin MCP-01 from the deep sea bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913 is a collagenolytic protease of the S8 family with a C-terminal polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domain that is responsible for collagen binding (30.Zhao G.Y. Chen X.L. Zhao H.L. Xie B.B. Zhou B.C. Zhang Y.Z. Hydrolysis of insoluble collagen by deseasin MCP-01 from deep-sea Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913. Collagenolytic characters, collagen-binding ability of C-terminal polycystic kidney disease domain, and implication for its novel role in deep-sea sedimentary particulate organic nitrogen degradation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 36100-36107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). AcpII from the deep sea bacterium Alkalimonas collagenimarina AC40, another S8 collagenolytic protease, contains a protease-associated domain to regulate the access of substrates to the catalytic domain (31.Kurata A. Uchimura K. Kobayashi T. Horikoshi K. Collagenolytic subtilisin-like protease from the deep-sea bacterium Alkalimonas collagenimarina AC40T.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 86: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The collagen degradation mechanisms of subtilisin-like collagenolytic proteases are rarely studied. Myroides profundi D25 is a protease-secreting bacterium isolated from the deep sea sediment of the southern Okinawa Trough at a water depth of 1245 m (32.Zhang X.Y. Zhang Y.J. Chen X.L. Qin Q.L. Zhao D.L. Li T.G. Dang H.Y. Zhang Y.Z. Myroides profundi sp. nov., isolated from deep-sea sediment of the southern Okinawa Trough.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2008; 287: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that the D25 strain produces a novel elastinolytic metalloprotease, myroilysin, which also has strong collagen-swelling ability and cooperates with collagenase in collagen hydrolysis (33.Chen X.L. Xie B.B. Bian F. Zhao G.Y. Zhao H.L. He H.L. Zhou B.C. Zhang Y.Z. Ecological function of myroilysin, a novel bacterial M12 metalloprotease with elastinolytic activity and a synergistic role in collagen hydrolysis, in biodegradation of deep-sea high-molecular-weight organic nitrogen.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 1838-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, a novel collagenolytic protease secreted by strain D25, designated myroicolsin, was purified and characterized. Gene cloning and sequence analysis showed that this enzyme is a novel subtilisin-like protease containing a unique domain structure. The function of some domains and propeptides of myroicolsin was studied by protein truncation, and the collagenolytic mechanism of myroicolsin was revealed in detail through microscopic observation and biochemical analysis. Finally, a collagen degradation model was proposed based on our results. M. profundi D25 isolated from the deep sea sediment of the southern Okinawa Trough was used for protease production (32.Zhang X.Y. Zhang Y.J. Chen X.L. Qin Q.L. Zhao D.L. Li T.G. Dang H.Y. Zhang Y.Z. Myroides profundi sp. nov., isolated from deep-sea sediment of the southern Okinawa Trough.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2008; 287: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli DH5α (Transgen Biotech) was used as the host for gene cloning. pET-22b(+) (Novagen) was used for the construction of expression vectors, and E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Transgen Biotech) was used as the host for protein expression. Insoluble type I collagen fiber (bovine Achilles tendon) was purchased from Worthington. Type II and IV collagens were purchased from BD Biosciences. α-Casein, elastin-orcein, azo dye-impregnated collagen, and decorin from bovine articular cartilage were purchased from Sigma. Gelatin was purchased from Boston Biomedical Inc., and trypsin was from Beijing Solarbio Co. Fish collagen was extracted from Cyprinus carpio skin using the method described previously (34.Sankar S. Sekar S. Mohan R. Rani S. Sundaraseelan J. Sastry T.P. Preparation and partial characterization of collagen sheet from fish (Lates calcarifer) scales.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2008; 42: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Acid-soluble collagen was prepared by dissolving insoluble bovine type I collagen in acetic acid and then dialyzing against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) at 4 °C overnight. All peptides were synthesized by China Peptides Co., Ltd. M. profundi D25 was cultured at 15 °C for 84 h in the fermentation medium containing 0.2% (w/v) yeast extract, 1% (w/v) gelatin, and artificial seawater (pH 8.0) with continuous shaking. The culture was centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 20 min), and the supernatant was precipitated by 55% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate powder. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 min) and dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.5, buffer A). After dialysis against buffer A for desalination, the proteases in the solution were purified on a pre-equilibrated DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) with a linear gradient of 0–0.8 m NaCl in buffer A. The fractions with collagenolytic activity were collected and further purified on a Sephadex G75 column with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5, buffer B). All purification procedures were conducted at 0–10 °C. Protease purity was analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The purified protease was named myroicolsin. Protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. The activities of myroicolsin toward multiple types of collagen and gelatin were assessed according to the method described by Worthington (35.Worthington Biochemical Co Worthington Enzyme Manual. Collagenase. Worthington Biochemical Co., Freehold, NJ1993Google Scholar). Briefly, myroicolsin was incubated for 5 h with insoluble collagen (bovine type I collagen or fish collagen) or for 0.5 h with soluble collagen (type II or type IV) or gelatin. The amino acids liberated were quantified using the colorimetric ninhydrin method with l-leucine as the standard. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1 nmol of l-leucine/h from insoluble collagen fibers or the amount that released 1 nmol of l-leucine/min from soluble collagens or gelatin. The activity against azo dye-impregnated collagen was measured according to the method of Abraham and Breuil (36.Abraham L.D. Breuil C. Isolation and characterization of a subtilisin-like serine proteinase secreted by the sap-staining fungus Ophiostoma piceae.Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1996; 18: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The activity toward casein was determined at 40 °C using the method of He et al. (37.He H.L. Chen X.L. Li J.W. Zhang Y.Z. Gao P.J. Taste improvement of refrigerated meat treated with cold-adapted protease.Food Chem. 2004; 84: 307-311Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The elastinolytic activity was determined with the method described by Chen et al. (33.Chen X.L. Xie B.B. Bian F. Zhao G.Y. Zhao H.L. He H.L. Zhou B.C. Zhang Y.Z. Ecological function of myroilysin, a novel bacterial M12 metalloprotease with elastinolytic activity and a synergistic role in collagen hydrolysis, in biodegradation of deep-sea high-molecular-weight organic nitrogen.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 1838-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The activities against synthetic peptides were measured at 25 °C using a previous method (38.Chen X.L. Xie B.B. Lu J.T. He H.L. Zhang Y. A novel type of subtilase from the psychrotolerant bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. SM9913. Catalytic and structural properties of deseasin MCP-01.Microbiology. 2007; 153: 2116-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The purified myroicolsin in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Sequi-Blot PVDF membrane, Bio-Rad), and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined by Edman degradation on a PROCISE491 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Inhibitor assays indicated that myroicolsin was a serine protease. Based on the N-terminal sequence of myroicolsin and the conserved sequence in the catalytic domain of serine proteases (39.Maciver B. McHale R.H. Saul D.J. Bergquist P.L. Cloning and sequencing of a serine proteinase gene from a thermophilic Bacillus species and its expression in Escherichia coli.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3981-3988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the myroicolsin gene containing 2040 bp was obtained by PCR and thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (40.Liu Y.G. Whittier R.F. Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR. Automatable amplification and sequencing of insert end fragments from P1 and YAC clones for chromosome walking.Genomics. 1995; 25: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). After verification with high fidelity Fastpfu DNA polymerase (Transgen Biotech), the nucleotide sequence of this gene was submitted to the GenBankTM database under accession number JF514144. The DNA fragments encoding mutants of myroicolsin were amplified by PCR using the genomic DNA of M. profundi D25 as a template. The recombinants were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) with the pET-22b(+) expression vector and induced with isopropyl-β-d- thiogalactopyranoside. The constructed recombinants included the following: Δβ/C (β-jelly roll domain and C-pro-secre-tail truncated mutant), Δβ (β-jelly roll domain truncated mutant), Δlinker/β (linker and β-jelly roll domain truncated mutant), and CT-β (expression of β-jelly roll domain). For Δβ/C, Δβ, and Δlinker/β, the cultures were incubated at 15 °C for 3–5 days with 0.05 mm isopropyl-β-d- thiogalactopyranoside. The supernatants were then collected and purified by the same method used for wild-type myroicolsin. For recombinant CT-β, the culture was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d- thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C for 12 h. After centrifuging the culture, the intracellular target proteins were released by sonication in an ice bath and were further purified with a His-Bind column (Novagen). The collagen-binding ability of CT-β was analyzed by using a previous method with minor modifications (26.Itoi Y. Horinaka M. Tsujimoto Y. Matsui H. Watanabe K. Characteristic features in the structure and collagen-binding ability of a thermophilic collagenolytic protease from the thermophile Geobacillus collagenovorans MO-1.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 6572-6579Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Five milligrams of collagen fibers were incubated with buffer B at 0 °C for 30 min, the buffer was discarded, and collagen fibers were mixed with 20 μg of CT-β in 200 μl of buffer B at 0 or 25 °C. Samples were collected at 0, 2, 5, and 8 h and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Collagen fibers incubated with BSA, CT-β incubated in buffer B, and BSA incubated in buffer B were used as controls. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the collagen fiber before and after enzymatic treatment. Five milligrams of collagen fibers were incubated with 5 μg of myroicolsin in 100 μl of buffer B at 30 °C with continuous mixing, and samples were collected at different reaction times. Collagen fibers treated with buffer B served as the negative control. The separated collagen samples were rinsed with distilled water and lyophilized. Then the samples were deposited on aluminum foil and coated with 5 nm of platinum. Imaging was performed on a Hitachi FE-S4800 scanning electron microscope operated at 2.0–5.0 kV. The nanostructures of collagen fibrils and monomers were observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) after collagen fibers (5 mg) were incubated with 5 μg of myroicolsin in 100 μl of buffer B at 30 °C for 48 h with continuous mixing. The samples were rinsed twice with distilled water, spread onto freshly cleaved mica, and dried in air. Imaging was performed in air in ScanAsyst mode using a Multimode Nanoscope VIII AFM (Bruker AXS) with a J-type scanner. Probe NSC11 (MikroMasch) with a cantilever length of 90 μm and a nominal spring constant of 48 newtons/m was used. The cross-section analysis was performed with the associated AFM software Nanoscope Analysis. Two milligrams of collagen fibers were treated with 1 μm myroicolsin at 30 °C for 24 h, and the dry weight of collagen fibers before and after treatment was analyzed using an analytical balance. The amino acids released from 10 mg of collagen fibers by 1 μm myroicolsin at 30 °C were quantified using a colorimetric ninhydrin method with l-leucine as the standard. To test whether myroicolsin could release glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) from the proteoglycan within collagen fibrils simultaneously, the GAG concentration in the supernatant of the digested mixture was quantified by the dimethylmethylene blue assay with chondroitin 4-sulfate as the standard (41.Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Improved quantitation and discrimination of sulphated glycosaminoglycans by use of dimethylmethylene blue.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2902) Google Scholar). Collagen fibers incubated with 5 μm trypsin or buffer B were used as the controls. To analyze the degradation of decorin, the archetypal proteoglycan of the vertebrate extracellular matrix, 0.5 mg of decorin was incubated with 0.1 μm myroicolsin in buffer B at 30 °C for 0, 5, 15, or 40 min. The hydrolyzed product was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Decorin incubated with 0.5 μm trypsin at 30 °C was used as the control. A fluorescence spectroscopy assay was used to detect the release of pyridinolines and deoxypyridinolines from the telopeptides of collagen monomers by myroicolsin. Collagen fibers (20 mg) were incubated with 0.1 μm myroicolsin at 30 °C for 48 h. The supernatant of the digested mixture was detected on an FP-6500 spectrometer (Jasco) at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Collagen fibers incubated with 0.1 μm trypsin or in buffer B were used as the controls. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was performed to analyze the effect of myroicolsin on the secondary structure of collagen monomers according to a method described previously (42.Wang Y.K.

Collagen fibers were incubated with 1 μm myroicolsin in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) at 25 °C and 50 °C. Collagen fibers incubated with buffer were used as the control. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 1% methanoic acid, and the hydrolytic products were separated by HPLC (Shimaduz) on a C18 column (Venusil MP C18). The molecular masses of the hydrolytic products were then determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) at the Beijing Protein Institute Co., Ltd. The sequences of these released peptides were identified by MASCOT MS/MS Ion Research tools and ExPASy tools. To confirm the P1 and P1′ residue preferences of myroicolsin, several peptides were synthesized by China Peptides Co., Ltd., based on the sequences of the peptides released from collagen polypeptide chains. Each of these peptides (250 μg) was mixed with 5 μg of myroicolsin in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5). After incubation at 25 °C for 1 h, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1% methanoic acid. The molecular masses and sequences of all released peptides were analyzed as described above.

The aim of this study was to investigate the factors that may link pioglitazone to bladder cancer. Materials and Methods In total, 34,970 study subjects were identified from the National Health Insurance Research Database in 2003 with follow-up from 2005 to 2009. The demographic characteristics of patients who had used and had never used pioglitazone, including age, sex, diabetes duration, urinary tract disease, nephropathy, bladder cancer, and cumulative dose and duration of pioglitazone therapy, were analyzed using the χ2 test. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to determine the independent effects of pioglitazone on bladder cancer and newly developed chronic kidney disease. Results Among 3,497 ever users and 31,473 never users of pioglitazone, the respective incident cases of bladder cancer were 12 (0.4%) and 72 (0.2%), and for newly developed chronic kidney disease 245 (8.1%) and 663 (2.3%), respectively. Ever use of pioglitazone [1.59(1.32–1.91)], cumulative dose of pioglitazone <10,500 mg [1.69 (1.37–2.01)] and >10,500 mg [1.34 (1.04–1.73)], and duration of therapy <12 months [1.68 (1.36–2.08)] and >12 months [1.39 (1.09–1.76)] were associated with the development of chronic kidney disease. Conclusions There was no association of pioglitazone use with bladder cancer development, however, there was an association with an increased risk of newly developed chronic kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W1964297174,"Background Obesity is increasing dramatically in the Asia-Pacific region particularly China. The population of Hong Kong was exposed to modernization far earlier than the rest of China, reflecting conditions that are likely to be replicated as other Chinese cities undergo rapid change. This study examined the relationship between television viewing and obesity in a Hong Kong sample. Information about the relationship between a key sedentary behavior, TV viewing, and obesity, and its moderation by demographic characteristics may identify sectors of the population at highest risk for excess weight. Methods Data were from Hong Kong Family and Health Information Trends Survey (2009–2010), a population-based survey on the public's use of media for health information and family communication by telephone interviews with 3,016 Hong Kong adults (age≥18 years). TV viewing time, body mass index (BMI), physical activity and other lifestyle variables were analyzed. Results Viewing time was longer in women, increased with age but decreased with education level and vigorous physical activity (all P<0.01). Longer TV viewing time was significantly associated with higher BMI (Coefficients B = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.24) after adjusting for age, gender, employment status, marital status, education level, smoking activity and vigorous physical activity. This association was stronger in women than men (Coefficients B: 0.19 versus 0.15) and strongest in those aged 18 to 34 years (Coefficients B = 0.35). Furthermore, an hour increase in daily TV viewing was associated with 10% greater odds of being obese. Conclusions A significant socioeconomic gradient in television viewing time was observed. TV viewing time positively associated with BMI and obesity. The TV viewing – BMI associations were strongest in women and young adults, suggesting vulnerable groups to target for obesity prevention by decreasing TV viewing."
https://openalex.org/W1977366150,"The 26S double-capped proteasome is assembled in a hierarchic event that is orchestrated by dedicated set of chaperons. To date, all stoichiometric subunits are considered to be present in equal ratios, thus providing symmetry to the double-capped complex. Here, we show that although the vast majority (if not all) of the double-capped 26S proteasomes, both 19S complexes, contain the ubiquitin receptor Rpn10/S5a, only one of these 19S particles contains the additional ubiquitin receptor Rpn13, thereby defining asymmetry in the 26S proteasome. These results were validated in yeast and mammals, utilizing biochemical and unbiased AQUA-MS methodologies. Thus, the double-capped 26S proteasomes are asymmetric in their polyubiquitin binding capacity. Our data point to a potential new role for ubiquitin receptors as directionality factors that may participate in the prevention of simultaneous substrates translocation into the 20S from both 19S caps."

Broad neutralization is attained by antibodies that bind to a handful of invariable but accessible regions of gp120 and gp41. Broadly neutralizing sera raised to gp120 have been found to contain antibodies that target the receptor-binding site, the glycan-V3 site, and the V1V2 loops, whereas antibodies in broadly neutralizing sera raised to gp41 appear to bind exclusively to the “membrane-proximal external region” (MPER) or pre-transmembrane domain within this subunit (7Stamatatos L.

X-ray crystallography further indicated that epitope binding does not involve the hydrophobic apex of the long complementarity-determining region (CDR)-H3 loop, an element shown to be crucial for the neutralizing function of the antibody (37Zwick M.B.

Given the close proximity of the epitope to the envelope surface, it has been proposed that the 2F5 CDR-H3 loop might interact directly with viral membrane lipids (14Ofek G. Tang M. Sambor A.

Alternatively, data have been recently reported suggesting that the CDR-H3 loop apex may establish additional contacts with MPER C-terminal residues in helical conformation (25Guenaga J. Wyatt R.T. Structure-guided alterations of the gp41-directed HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5 reveal new properties regarding its neutralizing function.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002806Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Julien J.P.

Virol. 2010; 84: 4136-4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These two options need not be mutually exclusive for bivalent antibodies targeting the 2F5 epitope on the surface of virions. It has been argued that MAb2F5-like antibodies could use a heteroligation strategy (i.e. to combine strong binding to gp41 and weak binding to viral membrane) to increase its avidity under conditions existing in the HIV envelope (9Klein F. Mouquet H. Dosenovic P. Scheid J.F. Scharf L. Nussenzweig M.C. Antibodies in HIV-1 vaccine development and therapy.Science. 2013; 341: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Here, we provide unprecedented results on the structure and immunogenicity of a peptide spanning the sequence 656NEQELLELDKWASLWNWFNITNWLWYIK683, which includes the complete 2F5 epitope (underlined), the downstream region proposed to establish weak contacts with the CDR-H3 loop of the antibody, and an aromatic-rich block that allows its insertion into the membrane interface (Fig. 1). The NMR data on this peptide, termed MPERp, support the folding of the complete HIV-1 2F5 epitope within a continuous kinked helix. IR confirmed the preservation of the main helical conformation in adjuvants representing licensed vaccine formulations (i.e. aluminum salt and water-in-oil emulsions) and in two different types of liposomes. Because it is predicted that the liposomal MPERs that mimic the 2F5 epitope will be bound by the functional neutralizing antibody, we performed assays to correlate function and binding. Consistent with previous reports (37Zwick M.B. Komori H.K. Stanfield R.L. Church S. Wang M. Parren P.W. Kunert R. Katinger H. Wilson I.A. Burton D.R. The long third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain is important in the activity of the broadly neutralizing anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody 2F5.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3155-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38Julien J.P. Huarte N. Maeso R. Taneva S.G. Cunningham A. Nieva J.L. Pai E.F. Ablation of the complementarity-determining region H3 apex of the anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5 abrogates neutralizing capacity without affecting core epitope binding.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 4136-4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), cell infection blocking in our in-house assay was dependent on the CDR-H3 loop. 2F5 binding to MPERp in liposomes made of anionic phospholipid and lipid A was also dependent on the CDR-H3 loop, whereas binding to the peptide on the surface of lesser charged Chol-containing vesicles did not require this element. All tested MPERp vaccines were immunogenic. However, significant amounts of 2F5 epitope-targeting antibodies with the capacity of blocking cell infection were only recovered from sera of rabbits immunized with liposomal vaccines displaying a correlation between 2F5 antibody function and binding, i.e. those based on the anionic phospholipid and lipid A. Insights into the structural basis for functional antibody generation could be gained by combining IR and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) analyses. These data suggest that membrane-inserted helical bundles, rather than monomers adsorbed to the membrane interface, may embody efficient MPER vaccines. Together, our structural and immunogenicity data conform to the prediction that MPER may fold as a single contiguous antigenic determinant, competent in generating a neutralizing response and therefore supporting the application of derived peptides in combination with liposomes as stand-alone vaccines to target the 2F5 epitope. MPERp and the 2F5 peptide epitopes used in the immunological studies were synthesized in C-terminal carboxamide form by solid phase methods using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, purified by reverse phase HPLC, and characterized by matrix-assisted time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (purity >95%). Peptides were routinely dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, spectroscopy grade), and their concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid microassay (Pierce). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), phosphatidic acid (PA), Chol, and lipid A detoxified (Salmonella minnesota R595) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) was from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). MAb2F5 was kindly donated by Dietmar Katinger (Polymun Scientific, Klosterneuburg, Austria). Fab2F5-WT and Fab2F5-ΔCDR-H3 were produced as described previously (38Julien J.P. Huarte N. Maeso R. Taneva S.G. Cunningham A. Nieva J.L. Pai E.F. Ablation of the complementarity-determining region H3 apex of the anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody 2F5 abrogates neutralizing capacity without affecting core epitope binding.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 4136-4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). NMR samples were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized peptides (∼1 mg) in 0.5 ml of a H2O/D2O (9:1 ratio by volume) solution containing 2 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.0 and either 25% (v/v) 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP; D2, 98%; Cambridge Isotopes Lab) or 20 mm deuterated DPC (D38, 98%; Cambridge Isotopes Lab). Peptide concentrations were ∼0.5 mm. pH was measured with a glass microelectrode and not corrected for isotope effects. A methanol sample was used to calibrate the temperature of the NMR probe. Chemical shifts were referenced to internal sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. The 1H NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance-600 spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 600.13 MHz and equipped with a cryoprobe. One-dimensional spectra were acquired using 32 K data points, which were zero-filled to 64 K data points before performing the Fourier transformation. Phase-sensitive two-dimensional correlated spectroscopy (COSY), total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY), and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra were recorded by standard techniques using presaturation of the water signal and the time-proportional phase incrementation mode, as reported previously (42Mirassou Y.

https://openalex.org/W2078844104,"The experiment was setup to investigate the coordination and control of the degrees of freedom (DFs) of human standing posture with particular reference to the identification of the collective and component variables. Subjects stood in 3 postural tasks: feet side by side, single left foot quiet stance and single left foot stance with body rocking at the ankle joint in the sagittal plane. All three postural tasks showed very high coherence (∼1) of center of pressure (COP) - center of mass (COM) in the low frequency range. The ankle and hip coherence was mid range (∼.5) with the tasks having different ankle/hip compensatory cophase patterns. The findings support the view that the in-phase relation of the low frequency components of the COP-COM dynamic is the collective variable in the postural tasks investigated. The motions of the individual joints (ankle, knee, hip, neck) and couplings of pair wise joint synergies (e.g., ankle-hip) provide a supporting cooperative role to the preservation of the collective variable in maintaining the COM within the stability region of the base of support (BOS) and minimizing the amount of body motion consistent with the task constraint."

Objective To examine the natural history of food hypersensitivity, the natural history of IgE sensitisation to food allergens and to investigate the risk factors for new onset food hypersensitivity. Methods Food hypersensitivity was questionnaire-assessed in 2307 individuals (aged 20–45 years) from Iceland and Sweden during the European Community Respiratory Health Survey both at baseline and follow-up 9 years later. IgE food and aeroallergen sensitisation were assessed in a subgroup of these individuals (n = 807). Values of 0.35 kU/L and above were regarded as positive sensitisation. Results Food hypersensitivity was reported by 21% of the subjects and this proportion remained unchanged at follow-up (p = 0.58). Fruits, nuts and vegetables were the three most common causes of food hypersensitivity, with a similar prevalence at baseline and follow-up. The prevalence IgE sensitisation to food allergens decreased in general by 56% (p<0.001) and IgE sensitisation to peanut decreased in particular by 67% (p = 0.003). The prevalence of timothy grass IgE sensitisation decreased by 15% (p = 0.003) while cat, mite and birch IgE sensitisation did not decrease significantly. Female sex, rhinitis, eczema and presence of IgE sensitisation to aeroallergens were independently associated with new onset food hypersensitivity. Conclusion The prevalence of food hypersensitivity remained unchanged while the prevalence of IgE sensitisation to food allergens decreased in adults over a 9-year follow-up period. The decrease in prevalence of IgE sensitisation to food allergens was considerably larger than the change in prevalence of IgE sensitisation to aeroallergens."
https://openalex.org/W2094885129,"Background Genetic architecture of coronary artery disease (CAD) is still to be defined. Since low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) gene play critical roles in Wnt signal transduction which are important for vascular development and endodermis specification, we therefore resequenced it to search for mutations in CAD patients. Methods We systemically sequenced all the exons and promoter region of LRP6 gene in a sample of 380 early onset CAD patients and 380 control subjects in Chinese. Results In total, we identified 5 patient-specific mutations including K82N (two patients), S488Y (one patient), P1066T (two patients), P1206H (two patients) and I1264V (one patient) All these mutations located at the extracellular domain of LRP6 gene. In vitro functional analysis of patient-specific mutations demonstrated that these mutations resulted in a significant reduction in both protein level transporting to cell membrane and downstream Wnt signal activity. Furthermore, we found that LRP6 novel mutations attenuated proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) when compared with wild type (WT) LRP6. Conclusion Our results demonstrated that these loss-of-function variants might contribute to disease liability in a subset of CAD and defects in Wnt signal activation might be important contributing factors for the onset of CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2045321973,"Despite uncontested evidence for fossils belonging to the early hominin genus Australopithecus in East Africa from at least 4.2 million years ago (Ma), and from Chad by 3.5 Ma, thus far there has been no convincing evidence of Australopithecus, Paranthropus or early Homo from the western (Albertine) branch of the Rift Valley. Here we report the discovery of an isolated upper molar (#Ish25) from the Western Rift Valley site of Ishango in Central Africa in a derived context, overlying beds dated to between ca. 2.6 to 2.0 Ma. We used µCT imaging to compare its external and internal macro-morphology to upper molars of australopiths, and fossil and recent Homo. We show that the size and shape of the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) surface discriminate between Plio-Pleistocene and post-Lower Pleistocene hominins, and that the Ishango molar clusters with australopiths and early Homo from East and southern Africa. A reassessment of the archaeological context of the specimen is consistent with the morphological evidence and suggest that early hominins were occupying this region by at least 2 Ma."
https://openalex.org/W1988333521,"Allee effects are an important component in the population dynamics of numerous species. Accounting for these Allee effects in population viability analyses generally requires estimates of low-density population growth rates, but such data are unavailable for most species and particularly difficult to obtain for large mammals. Here, we present a mechanistic modeling framework that allows estimating the expected low-density growth rates under a mate-finding Allee effect before the Allee effect occurs or can be observed. The approach relies on representing the mechanisms causing the Allee effect in a process-based model, which can be parameterized and validated from data on the mechanisms rather than data on population growth. We illustrate the approach using polar bears (Ursus maritimus), and estimate their expected low-density growth by linking a mating dynamics model to a matrix projection model. The Allee threshold, defined as the population density below which growth becomes negative, is shown to depend on age-structure, sex ratio, and the life history parameters determining reproduction and survival. The Allee threshold is thus both density- and frequency-dependent. Sensitivity analyses of the Allee threshold show that different combinations of the parameters determining reproduction and survival can lead to differing Allee thresholds, even if these differing combinations imply the same stable-stage population growth rate. The approach further shows how mate-limitation can induce long transient dynamics, even in populations that eventually grow to carrying capacity. Applying the models to the overharvested low-density polar bear population of Viscount Melville Sound, Canada, shows that a mate-finding Allee effect is a plausible mechanism for slow recovery of this population. Our approach is generalizable to any mating system and life cycle, and could aid proactive management and conservation strategies, for example, by providing a priori estimates of minimum conservation targets for rare species or minimum eradication targets for pests and invasive species."
https://openalex.org/W2006640208,"Ecological interactions between aboveground and belowground biodiversity have received many attentions in the recent decades. Although soil biodiversity declined with the decrease of plant diversity, many previous studies found plant species identities were more important than plant diversity in controlling soil biodiversity. This study focused on the responses of soil biodiversity to the altering of plant functional groups, namely overstory and understory vegetations, rather than plant diversity gradient. We conducted an experiment by removing overstory and/or understory vegetation to compare their effects on soil microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and nematode diversities in eucalyptus monocultures. Our results indicated that both overstory and understory vegetations could affect soil microbial PLFA and nematode diversities, which manifested as the decrease in Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') and Pielou evenness index (J) and the increase in Simpson dominance index (λ) after vegetation removal. Soil microclimate change explained part of variance of soil biodiversity indices. Both overstory and understory vegetations positively correlated with soil microbial PLFA and nematode diversities. In addition, the alteration of soil biodiversity might be due to a mixing effect of bottom-up control and soil microclimate change after vegetation removal in the studied plantations. Given the studied ecosystem is common in humid subtropical and tropical region of the world, our findings might have great potential to extrapolate to large scales and could be conducive to ecosystem management and service."
https://openalex.org/W2154102709,"Acute heat shock can induce apoptosis through a canonical pathway involving the upstream activation of caspase-2, followed by BID cleavage and stimulation of the intrinsic pathway. Herein, we report that the BH3-only protein BIM, rather than BID, is essential to heat shock-induced cell death. We observed that BIM-deficient cells were highly resistant to heat shock, exhibiting short and long-term survival equivalent to Bax−/−Bak−/− cells and better than either Bid−/− or dominant-negative caspase-9-expressing cells. Only Bim−/− and Bax−/−Bak−/− cells exhibited resistance to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and loss of mitochondrial inner membrane potential. Moreover, while dimerized caspase-2 failed to induce apoptosis in Bid−/− cells, it readily did so in Bim−/− cells, implying that caspase-2 kills exclusively through BID, not BIM. Finally, BIM reportedly associates with MCL-1 following heat shock, and Mcl-1−/− cells were indeed sensitized to heat shock-induced apoptosis. However, pharmacological inhibition of BCL-2 and BCL-XL with ABT-737 also sensitized cells to heat shock, most likely through liberation of BIM. Thus, BIM mediates heat shock-induced apoptosis through a BAX/BAK-dependent pathway that is antagonized by antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members."
https://openalex.org/W2046793133,"Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) can ambiguously behave as either tumor suppressor or oncogene depending on its phosphorylation state and the type of cancer. In this study we show that Cav-1 was phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 (pCav-1) by Src-kinase family members in various human cell lines and primary mouse cultures of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most frequent soft-tissue sarcoma affecting childhood. Cav-1 overexpression in the human embryonal RD or alveolar RH30 cells yielded increased pCav-1 levels and reinforced the phosphorylation state of either ERK or AKT kinase, respectively, in turn enhancing in vitro cell proliferation, migration, invasiveness and chemoresistance. In contrast, reducing the pCav-1 levels by administration of a Src-kinase inhibitor or through targeted Cav-1 silencing counteracted the malignant in vitro phenotype of RMS cells. Consistent with these results, xenotransplantation of Cav-1 overexpressing RD cells into nude mice resulted in substantial tumor growth in comparison to control cells. Taken together, these data point to pCav-1 as an important and therapeutically valuable target for overcoming the progression and multidrug resistance of RMS."
https://openalex.org/W1981871264,"Through physiological integration, clonal plants can support ramets in unfavourable patches, exploit heterogeneously distributed resources and distribute resources that are taken up over large areas. Physiological integration generally increases in adverse conditions, but it is not well known which factors determine the evolution of physiological integration. The aim of this study was to investigate if clonal plants from Southern and Northern populations of the clonal herb Aegopodium podagraria differed in physiological integration in terms of translocation of carbon to the rhizomes, and in biomass production using a reciprocal transplant experiment. Aegopodium podagraria from shaded conditions have been suggested to share more resources than clones from open conditions and therefore, plants from forest and open populations within the Southern and Northern regions were included. The regional growing conditions greatly affected biomass production. Plants grown in North Sweden produced more biomass and allocated more biomass to shoots, while plants grown in South Sweden allocated more biomass to rhizomes. There was a regional origin effect as plants originating from North Sweden produced more biomass in both regions. Within the Northern region, plants from shaded habitats translocated more 14C to the rhizomes, suggesting more storage there than in plants from open habitats. In addition to genetic differentiation in biomass production between Northern and Southern populations, probably as a response to a shorter growing season in the North, there appeared to be genetic differentiation in physiological integration within the Northern region. This shows that both regional and local conditions need to be taken into account in future studies of genetic differentiation of physiological integration in clonal plants."
https://openalex.org/W2058211893,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) is a liver-enriched transcription factor essential for liver development and function. In hepatocytes, HNF4α regulates a large number of genes important for nutrient/xenobiotic metabolism and cell differentiation and proliferation. Currently, little is known about the epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation by HNF4α. In this study, the global and specific alterations at the selected gene loci of representative histone modifications and DNA methylations were investigated in Hnf4a-deficient female mouse livers using the improved MeDIP-, hMeDIP- and ChIP-qPCR assay. Hnf4a deficiency significantly increased hepatic total IPed DNA fragments for histone H3 lysine-4 dimethylation (H3K4me2), H3K4me3, H3K9me2, H3K27me3 and H3K4 acetylation, but not for H3K9me3, 5-methylcytosine,or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. At specific gene loci, the relative enrichments of histone and DNA modifications were changed to different degree in Hnf4a-deficient mouse liver. Among the epigenetic signatures investigated, changes in H3K4me3 correlated the best with mRNA expression. Additionally, Hnf4a-deficient livers had increased mRNA expression of histone H1.2 and H3.3 as well as epigenetic modifiers Dnmt1, Tet3, Setd7, Kmt2c, Ehmt2, and Ezh2. In conclusion, the present study provides convenient improved (h)MeDIP- and ChIP-qPCR assays for epigenetic study. Hnf4a deficiency in young-adult mouse liver markedly alters histone methylation and acetylation, with fewer effects on DNA methylation and 5-hydroxymethylation. The underlying mechanism may be the induction of epigenetic enzymes responsible for the addition/removal of the epigenetic signatures, and/or the loss of HNF4α per se as a key coordinator for epigenetic modifiers."
https://openalex.org/W2169636321,"Fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment are a key determinant in cancer progression and may be a promising target for cancer therapy. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) is known as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer (CRC). The present study investigated the inductive mechanism of IGFBP7 expression in fibroblasts by supernatant from the CRC cell line, SW620. The results showed that the expression of IGFBP7 was up-regulated in the fibroblasts when treated with SW620 supernatant and exogenous TGF-β1. The IGFBP7 induced by SW620 supernatant or TGF-β1 was partially inhibited by the TGF-β1 specific antibody AF and TGF-β1 receptor antagonist SB431542. The Wnt signaling-targeted genes, c-Myc, CCND1 and the proteins Dvl2/3, were all up-regulated in fibroblasts expressing high levels of IGFBP7, and the up-regulation could be inhibited both by the Wnt signaling antagonist Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) and by the TGF-β1 receptor antagonist SB431542. In conclusion, CRC cells promote the high expression of IGFBP7 in fibroblasts, most likely through the co-regulation of TGF-β and Wnt signaling in a Smad2/3-Dvl2/3 dependent manner. Taken together, these data suggest that the fibroblasts could be a novel therapeutic target in tumor therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1984601186,"This survey was conducted in two protected areas in Nigeria to genetically identify individual lions and to determine the genetic variation within and between the populations. We used faecal sample DNA, a non-invasive alternative to the risky and laborious task of taking samples directly from the animals, often preceded by catching and immobilization. Data collection in Yankari Game Reserve (YGR) spanned through a period of five years (2008 –2012), whereas data in Kainji Lake National Park (KLNP) was gathered for a period of three years (2009, 2010 and 2012). We identified a minimum of eight individuals (2 males, 3 females, 3 unknown) from YGR and a minimum of ten individuals (7 males, 3 females) from KLNP. The two populations were found to be genetically distinct as shown by the relatively high fixation index (FST = 0.17) with each population exhibiting signs of inbreeding (YGR FIS = 0.49, KLNP FIS = 0.38). The genetic differentiation between the Yankari and Kainji lions is assumed to result from large spatial geographic distance and physical barriers reducing gene flow between these two remaining wild lion populations in Nigeria. To mitigate the probable inbreeding depression in the lion populations within Nigeria it might be important to transfer lions between parks or reserves or to reintroduce lions from the zoos back to the wild."
https://openalex.org/W1979342628,"Prenatal malnutrition can affect the phenotype of offspring by changing epigenetic regulation of specific genes. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that calcium (Ca) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance syndrome. We hypothesized that pregnant female rats fed a Ca-deficient diet would have offspring with altered hepatic glucocorticoid-related gene expression and that lactation would modify these alterations.We determined the effects of Ca deficiency during pregnancy and/or lactation on hepatic 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (Hsd11b1) expression in offspring. Female Wistar rats consumed either a Ca-deficient (D: 0.008% Ca) or control (C: 0.90% Ca) diet ad libitum from 3 weeks preconception to 21 days postparturition. On postnatal day 1, pups were cross-fostered to the same or opposite dams and divided into the following four groups: CC, DD, CD, and DC (first letter: original mother's diet; second letter: nursing mother's diet). All offspring were fed a control diet beginning at weaning (day 21) and were killed on day 200 ± 7. Serum insulin and adipokines in offspring were measured using ELISA kits.In males, mean levels of insulin, glucose, and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) were higher in the DD and DC groups than in the CC group. We found no difference in HOMA-IR between the CC and CD groups in either males or females. Expression of Hsd11b1 was lower in male DD rats than in CC rats. Hsd11b1 expression in male offspring nursed by cross-fostered dams was higher than that in those nursed by dams fed the same diet; CC vs. CD and DD vs. DC. In females, Hsd11b1 expression in DC rats was higher than that in CC rats.These findings indicated that maternal Ca restriction during pregnancy and/or lactation alters postnatal growth, Hsd11b1 expression, and insulin resistance in a sex-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2040234021,"In β-cells, syntaxin (Syn)-1A interacts with SUR1 to inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP channels). PIP2 binds the Kir6.2 subunit to open KATP channels. PIP2 also modifies Syn-1A clustering in plasma membrane (PM) that may alter Syn-1A actions on PM proteins like SUR1. Here, we assessed whether the actions of PIP2 on activating KATP channels is contributed by sequestering Syn-1A from binding SUR1. In vitro binding showed that PIP2 dose-dependently disrupted Syn-1A·SUR1 complexes, corroborated by an in vivo Forster resonance energy transfer assay showing disruption of SUR1(-EGFP)/Syn-1A(-mCherry) interaction along with increased Syn-1A cluster formation. Electrophysiological studies of rat β-cells, INS-1, and SUR1/Kir6.2-expressing HEK293 cells showed that PIP2 dose-dependent activation of KATP currents was uniformly reduced by Syn-1A. To unequivocally distinguish between PIP2 actions on Syn-1A and Kir6.2, we employed several strategies. First, we showed that PIP2-insensitive Syn-1A-5RK/A mutant complex with SUR1 could not be disrupted by PIP2, consequently reducing PIP2 activation of KATP channels. Next, Syn-1A·SUR1 complex modulation of KATP channels could be observed at a physiologically low PIP2 concentration that did not disrupt the Syn-1A·SUR1 complex, compared with higher PIP2 concentrations acting directly on Kir6.2. These effects were specific to PIP2 and not observed with physiologic concentrations of other phospholipids. Finally, depleting endogenous PIP2 with polyphosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin-1, known to disperse Syn-1A clusters, freed Syn-1A from Syn-1A clusters to bind SUR1, causing inhibition of KATP channels that could no longer be further inhibited by exogenous Syn-1A. These results taken together indicate that PIP2 affects islet β-cell KATP channels not only by its actions on Kir6.2 but also by sequestering Syn-1A to modulate Syn-1A availability and its interactions with SUR1 on PM."
https://openalex.org/W2077594926,"We studied the behavioral and emotional dynamics displayed by two people trying to resolve a conflict. 59 groups of two people were asked to talk for 20 minutes to try to reach a consensus about a topic on which they disagreed. The topics were abortion, affirmative action, death penalty, and euthanasia. Behavior data were determined from audio recordings where each second of the conversation was assessed as proself, neutral, or prosocial. We determined the probability density function of the durations of time spent in each behavioral state. These durations were well fit by a stretched exponential distribution, [Formula: see text] with an exponent, [Formula: see text], of approximately 0.3. This indicates that the switching between behavioral states is not a random Markov process, but one where the probability to switch behavioral states decreases with the time already spent in that behavioral state. The degree of this ""memory"" was stronger in those groups who did not reach a consensus and where the conflict grew more destructive than in those that did. Emotion data were measured by having each person listen to the audio recording and moving a computer mouse to recall their negative or positive emotional valence at each moment in the conversation. We used the Hurst rescaled range analysis and power spectrum to determine the correlations in the fluctuations of the emotional valence. The emotional valence was well described by a random walk whose increments were uncorrelated. Thus, the behavior data demonstrated a ""memory"" of the duration already spent in a behavioral state while the emotion data fluctuated as a random walk whose steps did not have a ""memory"" of previous steps. This work demonstrates that statistical analysis, more commonly used to analyze physical phenomena, can also shed interesting light on the dynamics of processes in social psychology and conflict management."
https://openalex.org/W2135308028,"The effects of an increased disease mortality rate on the transient and asymptotic dynamics of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were investigated. Disease-induced mortality of juvenile salmon has become a serious concern in recent years. However, the overall effects of disease mortality on the asymptotic and transient dynamics of adult spawning abundance are still largely unknown. We explored various scenarios with regard to the density-dependent process, the distribution of survivorship over the juvenile phase, the disease mortality rate, and the infusion of stray hatchery fish. Our results suggest that the sensitivity to the disease mortality rate of the equilibrium adult spawning abundance and resilience (asymptotic return rate toward this equilibrium following a small perturbation) varied widely and differently depending on the scenario. The resilience and coefficient of variation of adult spawning abundance following a large perturbation were consistent with each other under the scenarios investigated. We conclude that the increase in disease mortality likely has an effect on fishery yield under a fluctuating environment, not only because the mean equilibrium adult spawning abundance has likely been reduced, but also because the resilience has likely decreased and the variance in adult spawning abundance has likely increased. We also infer the importance of incorporating finer-scale spatiotemporal information into population models and demonstrate a means for doing so within a matrix population modeling framework."
