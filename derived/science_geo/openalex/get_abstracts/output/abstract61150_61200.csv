https://openalex.org/W2052264293,"I have presented a series of observations on macromolecular interactions which occur during the terminal stages of lens cell differentiation. These are summarized in Fig. 2. Other cell types that undergo similar changes are the erythrocyte and skin cells (epidermis) during the process of keratinization. These other cells are also involved in the synthesis of highly specific proteins, and there are indications that molecular alterations similar to those described for the lens may also occur in these cells (26). Thus, elucidation of a specific series of macromolecular interactions such as those described may provide a basis for the biochemical definition of the terminal stages of cellular differentiation. Differentiation of the reticulocyte, for example, involves inactivation of the nucleus, stabilization of mRNA, and possibly a ribosomal breakdown such as I have described here (26). Furthermore, elucidation of the mechanisms of reactions involving the initiation of tissue-specific protein synthesis and subsequent nuclear inactivation, stabilization of mRNA, and breakdown of the ribosomes may provide a basis for defining the mechanisms of terminal cellular differentiation."

These changes indicate that serotonin in the brain can be released via a specific neural pathway, namely, the system of axons projecting into the forebrain from serotonin-containing neurons in the midbrain raphé."

Genes at this locus also control most of the specificities measured by cytotoxic antiserums to leukocytes. Both of these tests can be used to predict survival of skin grafts. It is proposed that this is the major histocompatibility locus in man.
https://openalex.org/W1552195617,"Abstract Introduction of an amino and a carboxyl group onto carbon 2 of the bicycloheptane ring of norcamphor, by way of the corresponding spirohydantoin, produced a model substrate in which rigidly specified positions are taken by carbon atoms corresponding to those of the ordinary branched chain amino acids. This substance is transported by the system serving for amino acids with apolar (usually, branched) side chains in all cells and tissues tested. No measurable transport of it by any other system has yet been observed, the Na+-dependent systems of various erythrocytes and the Ehrlich cell having been specifically excluded. No unsuspected heterogeneity was detected in the Na+-independent transport of amino acids with apolar side chains by its use. We have used another new synthetic amino acid to illustrate how this substance can be used in conjunction with α-(methylamino)-isobutyric acid for determining by what routes a given amino acid is transported. When the bicyclic amino acid was prepared instead by way of the aminonitrile, the product contained only 31% (rather than the 92% obtained by way of the hydantoin) of the generally effective component, as separated by chromatography on sulfonated polystyrene resin. These two components are presumed to be the endo and exo isomers, although conformations have not yet been assigned. Of the two forms, only the one migrating more slowly on resin columns was taken up by Escherichia coli and that by the system serving for branched chain amino acids. The same product was taken up 2.5 times as fast by the human red blood cell, 3.7 times as fast by the pigeon red blood cell, and 5 times as fast in the Ehrlich cell, as the a isomer. The binding of b-2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid to the leucine-binding protein of E. coli and its inhibition of the binding of leucine were far weaker than predicted from its Km and Ki values for transport and inhibition of leucine transport. The bicyclic amino acid has permitted new discriminations of transport agencies and interactions, and may be expected to assist in the further discrimination of transport systems and other biological receptor systems. Determination of the absolute configuration and conformation of the active isomer should assist in the description of specific transport receptor sites, both that which accepts it and those that exclude it."

https://openalex.org/W1966250251,"Late gastrulae of paracentrotus lividus regenerated cilia after being deciliated in hypertonic sea water. Regeneration was not affected by actinomycin D or puromycin. Actinomycin D also did not affect ciliary protein synthesis during regeneration, although overall embryonic synthesis was depressed. Puromycin inhibited both total embryonic and ciliary protein synthesis. The data indicate that ciliary protein synthesis is controlled by a stable template and that the regenerating cilia are formed from a pool of ciliary proteins. It is suggested that the proteins of the mitotic apparatus and of the ciliamay be related."
https://openalex.org/W1491464889,"Abstract Countercurrent distribution of baker's yeast transfer RNA (tRNA) gives rise to two peaks (I and II) of methionine acceptor activity. Methionine tRNA (tRNAfmet) (Peak I) has been purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and by reverse phase chromatography. It has the following properties. (a) It can be aminoacylated with methionine by either crude yeast or Escherichia coli aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. (b) The methionyl-tRNA thus formed can be further converted to N-formyl-methionyl-tRNA (fMet-tRNAfmet) in the presence of formyl tetrahydrofolic acid and E. coli methionyl-tRNA transformylase. (c) Amino acid incorporation studies in vitro with poly r(U-G) and poly r(A-U-G) as messengers show that, similar to E. coli fMet-tRNAfmet, the yeast fMet-tRNAfmet can bring about the initiation of protein synthesis under the direction of either of the initiator codons G-U-G or A-U-G. Analysis of fragments produced by the action of takadiastase Ribonuclease T1 show that the 5'- and 3'-terminal nucleotide sequences of yeast tRNAfmet are pA-G-, and C-U-A-C-C-A, respectively; the terminal sequences thus derived are not identical with those present in E. coli tRNAfmet. Under conditions of magnesium ion concentration (5 mm) used for the aminoacylation of tRNAfmet (Peak I), tRNAmet (Peak II) is aminoacylated by crude E. coli aminoacyl tRNA synthetases at a slow rate. At 15 mm Mg++, however, tRNAmet (Peak II) is aminoacylated with methionine to the same extent by crude E. coli aminoacyl tRNA synthetases as by yeast aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. Met-tRNA from Peak II cannot be converted to fMet-tRNA by E. coli extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1498518594,"Abstract Protein synthesis is the result of a series of coupled events, many of which can be measured. In this report, the determination of the synthesis of peptides of chain length three and greater was used as a measure of translocation, the movement of the ribosome along the polyribonucleotide template. Translocation was observed both in the presence and absence of one added soluble transfer factor with the use of a polyuridylic acid template; with the use of a polyadenylic acid template, translocation required the transfer factor (Factor G). Characteristics of oligophenylalanine formation in the presence and absence of Factor G suggested several conclusions. The lack of secondary structure of polyuridylic acid templates probably permits oligophenylalanine synthesis in the absence of any additional supernatant transfer factor. High magnesium (g0.04 m) inhibits protein synthesis through its inhibition of translocation; this inhibition is independent of Factor G and therefore is an effect on the template-ribosome-transfer RNA complex. In contrast, the steroid antibiotic fusidic acid inhibits translocation through an effect on Factor G itself."
https://openalex.org/W1572999750,"Abstract Reversible, pH-dependent changes in the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase have been studied by optical rotatory dispersion, circular dichroism, and sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, with the use of the native zinc enzyme, the apoenzyme, and an enzyme in which the zinc has been replaced by cobalt. Ultracentrifugation studies show that the molecule remains a dimer between pH 8 and 4. The weight average molecular weight, Mw, as determined by the Yphantis method of equilibrium centrifugation, over this pH range varies from 80,000 to 100,000 depending on conditions of pH and ionic strength. Optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism spectra show only minor changes in protein conformation in this region. The circular dichroism spectrum shows some contributions from the α-helical conformation of the polypeptide chain with negative ellipticity bands at 222 mµ and 209 mµ. However, a major positive band occurs at 195 mµ, and detailed analysis of the curves indicate that β and random coil conformations of the peptide bond must make major contributions as well. Below pH 4, the molecule undergoes a radical change in conformation associated with the dissociation of the molecule into subunits. Mw is near 40,000 at pH 2. All changes can be completely reversed by returning the molecule to neutral pH. Reassociation of the molecule, however, follows a different pathway, and complete redimerization does not occur until pH 6.0. Thus, a major hysteresis effect occurs in the pH dependence of Mw and s20,w corresponding to the hysteresis previously observed for the hydrogen ion titration of the protein (Schlesinger, M. J., and Barrett, K., J. Biol. Chem., 240, 4284 (1965)). The apoenzyme at neutral pH is about 25% monomer, and has a conformation similar to that of the native enzyme. Determinations of Mw and s20,w as functions of pH show that the apoenzyme undergoes dissociation and reassociation like the native dimer. However, 25% monomer remains on return of the apoenzyme to neutral pH. Addition of either Zn(II) or Co(II) causes the residual monomer to reassociate to the dimer. Equilibrium dialysis studies show that the biosynthesized 65Zn enzyme or the apoenzyme labeled with 65Zn bind between 2 and 3 g atoms of Zn(II) per mole at neutral pH. 65Zn dissociates from the enzyme between pH 6 and 4, and is halfdissociated at pH 5. Reassociation of the metal ion follows the same pH function. Binding studies with 60Co show that 2 g atoms of cobalt are bound to the apoenzyme in the neutral pH range, and that they dissociate about 1 pH unit higher than does zinc."
https://openalex.org/W2009067890,A local invasive-destructive reaction typical of that seen in allograft rejection occurs when Lewis rat spleen cells are inoculated under the capsule of Lewis kidney freshly grafted into F(1) hybrid hosts. Thus the donor lymphoid cells can be immunogenically stimulated by circulating host leukocytes and the interaction of these two cell populations results in nonspecific damage to kidney parenchyma. The results indicate that passenger leukocytes in organ allografts may be important immunogenic agents.

https://openalex.org/W1562179826,"Abstract Previous studies have shown that diazoacetyl--dl-norleucine methyl ester inactivates pepsin, that Cu(II) greatly facilitates the reaction, and that in the presence of Cu(II) substitution occurs specifically at the carboxyl group of an aspartic acid residue in the enzyme. The present experiments were designed to establish the reasons for the speed and specificity of the reaction and the role of the metal ion. Ag(I) proves to be as effective as Cu(II) in promoting the reaction, whereas Cd(II), Co(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II) are not effective. Au(III) inactivates pepsin in the absence of a diazo compound. If Cu(II) and the diazo compound are mixed prior to the addition of pepsin, the rate of inactivation is increased, suggesting that a reactive complex is formed. The pH optimum for inactivation in the presence of Cu(II) is pH 5.5 to 5.8, whereas with Ag(I) it is pH 4.9. If the diazo compound and Cu(II) are mixed prior to the addition of pepsin, the pH optimum is reduced to about pH 5.0. The diazotized inhibitor need not be a substrate analogue, for diazoacetylglycine ethyl ester serves as well as the norleucine derivative. Diazoacetic acid methyl ester also inactivates pepsin rapidly in the presence of Cu(II), but more than 1 eq of reagent is incorporated. Although the rates of inactivation of pepsin prepared from pepsinogen and of commercial pepsin are similar, the stoichiometry of the reaction is not. More diazoacetyl compound is incorporated into commercial pepsin, which is known to be heterogeneous, than into pepsin prepared from pepsinogen. It is suggested that a copper-complexed carbene is the reactive species. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that dimethylsulfonium phenacylide, which is known to form such a complex, rapidly inactivates pepsin in the presence of Cu(II). Reaction of a carbene is thought to occur at a protonated carboxyl and the specificity is determined by the proximity of an ionized carboxyl which serves to orient the positively charged inhibitor molecule. The proposed mechanism of inactivation is compatible with the presence at or near the active site of pepsin of two carboxyl groups of markedly different pK values. One of these carboxyl groups has a pK higher than either of the two groups which previous kinetic studies have implicated in the activity of the enzyme. It thus appears that there may be at least three carboxyl groups involved in the active site of pepsin."

https://openalex.org/W1559585612,"Abstract The synthesis of RNA in two strains of Escherichia coli 15 TAU and CP 78, has been studied. With 3H-uracil-labeling data and the measured specific activity of cellular UTP pools over very short labeling periods at 27°, several observations have been made. 1. The initial observed rate of RNA synthesis is approximately 2.7 times faster than the rate of accumulation of stable RNA. Thus, about 60% of the cellular capacity for RNA synthesis is devoted to production of mRNA. 2. The number of nascent RNA chains in 15 TAU and CP 78 is 5100 chains per cell and 2500 chains per cell, respectively. 3. The two strains of E. coli had different growth rates and different observed rates of RNA synthesis, but the rates of chain elongation were 20 nucleotides per sec per chain for 15 TAU and 23 nucleotides per sec per chain for CP 78. This observation suggests that cellular control of the rate of RNA synthesis operates via regulation of the number of nascent chains, not their rate of elongation. 4. It is estimated that RNA polymerase molecules involved in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA are spaced at approximate intervals of 80 DNA base pairs and that these cistrons must be transcribed tandemly by multiple molecules simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W1596895939,"Abstract A purified enzyme from calf spleen has been found to methylate, in the presence of S-adenosyl-l-methionine-14CH3, a number of added crystalline proteins such as ovalbumin, pepsin, or human serum albumin. Before purification, the enzyme is capable of methylating endogenous protein present in spleen extracts. Incubation of crystalline ovalbumin and purified spleen methylase in the presence of S-adenosyl-l-ethionine-ethyl-1-C14 results in an incorporation of ethyl groups which is less than 3% of the incorporation of methyl groups. Acid or alkaline hydrolysis of radioactive enzymatically methylated ovalbumin yields a steam-distillable, radioactive compound which has been identified as methanol. Chemical studies have revealed that spleen protein methylase, unlike other known protein methylases, methylates an amino acid residue other than lysine or arginine, and, therefore, it represents a new enzymatic protein methylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2015726632,"Mice of the inbred SJL/J strain have a high incidence of a proliferative disease affecting several cell types, including reticulum cells and plasma cells, which is frequently accompanied by γ1 and γ2 paraproteinemia. In only some instances can serially transplantable lines of neoplastic cells be obtained; these are reticulum cell sarcomas. Mice with transplanted reticulum cell sarcomas do not have paraproteinemia and may develop profound hypogammaglobulinemia. The disease may be viewed as an abnormal proliferation of reticulum cells which differentiate into plasma cells with consequent paraproteinemia; the subsequent emergence of transplantable reticulum cell sarcoma appears as an end stage in which this capacity to differentiate is lost."
https://openalex.org/W1484942510,"Abstract Prolyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase of Escherichia coli B exists in vitro as an active dimer or as an inactive monomer, separable by hydroxylapatite chromatography. The monomer neither charges E. coli transfer ribonucleic acid nor catalyzes the proline-dependent adenosine triphosphate-pyrophosphate exchange reaction. At temperatures below 37°, in the absence of glycerol or sucrose, the enzyme is in equilibrium between the active dimer and the inactive monomer. Incubation at temperatures between 37° and 40° or addition of sucrose or glycerol at 0° completely converts the enzyme into the dimer, whereas cooling in the absence of sucrose or glycerol converts the enzyme into the monomer. The dimerization follows second order kinetics. It requires neither divalent cations nor adenosine triphosphate and can occur in various buffers. The dimer is stabilized by adenosine triphosphate or transfer ribonucleic acid. The monomerization follows first order kinetics, the dimer having a half-life of 45 min at pH 6.9 at 0°. In sucrose and glycerol gradient centrifugations the sedimentation velocities of the monomer and dimer are consistent with molecular weights of 47,000 and 94,000, respectively. The enzyme has been purified 250-fold in the presence of 10 to 40% glycerol."

https://openalex.org/W1585469558,"Abstract A specific transport system with high affinity for magnesium ions has been discovered in Escherichia coli. Experiments with 28Mg provided evidence that both uptake of radioactive magnesium into cells and the exit of magnesium from cells are mediated processes. The uptake of magnesium is greatly reduced when the cells are chilled to 0° or treated with sulfhydryl poisons such as N-ethylmaleimide. The exit of radioactive magnesium from cells previously grown on 28Mg takes place only in the presence of a pool of external unlabeled magnesium, and is also blocked by chilling and by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide."

https://openalex.org/W1491763464,Abstract Many T4 bacteriophage amber mutants in gene 43 do not induce the synthesis of either the phage DNA polymerase or the exonuclease which is physically inseparable from the polymerase. One mutant has been found in which a single amber mutation in gene 43 leads to the production of a protein which lacks the polymerase but retains the nuclease function of the wild type enzyme. The enzyme formed by this mutant in two unrelated nonpermissive hosts has chromatographic and enzymatic properties which differ somewhat from the wild type. Single step revertants of this mutant and infection of a permissive host by the mutant result in a polymerase and associated nuclease whose chromatographic and enzymatic properties are close to that of the wild type.

https://openalex.org/W1641897704,"Abstract Tryptic digestion rates of aspartate transcarbamylase, as well as reaction rates of p-mercuribenzoate with the thiol groups of this enzyme, were determined as a function of aspartate or succinate concentration. The two methods gave identical for a given ligand, indicating that increased digestibility and increased availability of thiol groups both reflect the same ligand-induced conformational transition. The shape of the state function given by aspartate alone was markedly different from that obtained with succinate in the presence of carbamyl phosphate. State functions for aspartate determined by digestibility were compared with saturation functions for aspartate obtained by activity measurements in the presence of carbamyl phosphate. This was done by plotting against each other the substrate concentrations required to reach the same degree of completion of the two functions. The resulting plot was linear throughout its entire course indicating that the shapes of the state and the corresponding saturation functions were identical, i.e. the curves were homologous. Such homology is not compatible with a concerted mechanism for allosteric transitions, but is consistent with a sequential mechanism. In fact, calculations using a wide range of assumptions for the concerted mechanism showed that this model cannot generate homologous state and saturation functions, and therefore cannot account for the behavior observed when aspartate was used as the ligand. In contrast to the apparent sequential behavior with aspartate, the data obtained by Gerhart and Schachman (Biochemistry, 7, 538 (1968)) using succinate (in the presence of carbamyl phosphate) were compatible with a concerted mechanism. It seems therefore that whether aspartate transcarbamylase will follow one, or the other, of these mechanisms depends on the ligand which occupies the catalytic site. The conformational effect of the allosteric activator, ATP was also investigated, and is discussed in relation to allosteric models."

The amino-terminal residues and the amino acid compositions of purified peptides were determined in order to establish the sequence of peptides and hence the sites of cleavage by the two enzymes. Evidence is presented indicating that the specificities of both enzymes are broad and similar. However, from the studies with protein as well as synthetic dipeptide substrates, definite differences have been shown. Kinetic parameters, Vmax and Km, for the hydrolysis of several benzyloxycarbonyl-l-tyrosyl peptides and benzyloxycarbonyl-l-tryptophanyl peptides with gastricsin were compared.

https://openalex.org/W1566756293,"Abstract A virus-induced enzyme, T2 exonuclease A, has been purified 250-fold from cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage T2e9. In order to obtain large quantities of infected cells for this purpose, a continuous system was devised for growing, infecting, and harvesting cells. The specificity of T2 exonuclease A is characterized by a stepwise attack beginning at the 3'-hydroxyl terminus of a polydeoxyribonucleotide chain and the liberation of 5'-mononucleotides. One molecule of the enzyme appears to remove terminal nucleotide residues randomly rather than to degrade any one polynucleotide chain completely before attacking another. Polynucleotide chains bearing a terminal 3'-phosphoryl group are not degraded by T2 exonuclease A. Dinucleotides terminated with a 5'-phosphomonoester end group are readily cleaved, but removal of the terminal 5'-phosphoryl group reduces the rate of cleavage 9-fold. Removal of the 5'-phosphoryl group from oligonucleotide chains containing 3 nucleotide residues or more does not affect the initial rate of cleavage of phosphodiester bonds. Although oligonucleotides of degree of polymerization less than 100 are degraded at least 100 times more rapidly than heat-denatured DNA, the enzyme has greater affinity for heat-denatured DNA. Because of these circumstances, heat-denatured DNA is a potent competitive inhibitor of the degradation of oligonucleotides. The enzyme has greater affinity for the DNA of bacteriophage T2, which contains glucosylated residues of hydroxymethylcytosine, than it has for a comparable preparation of salmon sperm DNA. However, it appears that the presence of the glucosylated residues decreases the rate of hydrolysis about 20-fold."

https://openalex.org/W1570451421,"Abstract The binding of 14C-phenylalanyl-tRNA to 70 S ribosomes was inhibited by the addition of the following tRNA preparations: 1, tRNA preparation in which no tRNA was acylated (tRNAmixCpCpA); 2, tRNA preparation in which all tRNA except for the one specific for phenylalanine have lost their terminal adenosine (tRNAmix-pheCpCp and tRNApheCpCpA); 3), tRNA preparation in which all the tRNA have lost their terminal adenosine (tRNAmixCpCp); and 4, tRNA preparation in which all tRNA have lost their terminal adenylic acid (tRNAmixCpC). The efficiency of inhibition was in the order of: 1 g 2 g 3 = 4. The binding of 14C-phenylalanyl-tRNA to the 30 S ribosomal subunits was inhibited by the various tRNA preparations listed above (1, 3, and 4) but there was no difference in the inhibitory efficiencies between these preparations of tRNA. Preparation 2 (tRNAmix-pheCpCp and tRNApheCpCpA) was more efficiently utilized than tRNA Preparation 1 (tRNAmixCpCpA) for polyphenylalanine formation. The 14C-phenylalanyl-tRNA prepared from 2 had a higher rate of binding to the complex of 70 S ribosomes and polyuridylic acid than 14C-phenylalanyl-tRNA prepared from 1. These results indicate that for binding of tRNA to 30 S ribosomal subunits the terminal adenosine of tRNA is not important while binding to 70 S subunits involves both the anticodon region and the terminal adenosine of tRNA. In the latter process, the presence of tRNA other than the specific tRNA coded by the corresponding messenger RNA has an inhibitory effect."

Cells previously labeled with H3-leucine for three generations were incubated for 30 minutes with chloramphenicol. Proteins synthesized during the initial 5 minutes of recovery from chloramphenicol treatment were labeled with C14-leucine. Marked variation in the ratios of C14- to H3-leucine in ribosomal protein occurred in cells that had been treated with chloramphenicol; untreated cells displayed little variation.

https://openalex.org/W1590852411,"Abstract The effects of divalent cation and ionic strength on the formation and the sedimentation properties of complexes of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase with polyribonucleotides have been investigated. At low ionic strength and in the presence of divalent cation, the enzyme binds to a polyribonucleotide, forming two complexes with sedimentation values of approximately 15 S and 21 S as detected by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The 15 S complex is the major one. As the ionic strength is increased, the 21 S and 15 S complexes disappear in that order, and a 13 S complex is detected; then, at a certain ionic strength which varies with the different polyribonucleotides, no complex formation occurs. The polyadenylate-enzyme complex is most sensitive to ionic strength, and the polyuridylate- and transfer RNA-enzyme complexes are least sensitive. At low ionic strength and in the absence of divalent cation, only a 13 S complex is formed. Studies of competition between each of the synthetic polyribonucleotides and transfer RNA for enzyme suggest that the order of reactivity of the polyribonucleotides is as follows: polyadenylate ≅ transfer RNA l polyadenylate-uridylate ≅ polycytidylate l polyuridylate."

https://openalex.org/W1566932595,"Abstract Qualitative and quantitative aspects of the interaction of biosynthetic homopolydeoxynucleotides with ribosomes have been investigated and compared to those for polyribonucleotides. The requirements for polydeoxynucleotide binding are similar to those for the ribose analogues in that there is no requirement for neomycin, supernatant, energy, or monovalent ion. The optimal Mg++ concentration and the kinetics of binding are identical for both polyribouridylic acid and the polydeoxynucleotides tested. Polydeoxynucleotides competitively inhibit the binding of polyribonucleotides, presumably by direct competition for the same binding site on the ribosome. Polymers containing only pyrimidine bases show considerably higher affinity for the ribosome than purine polymers. Alkyl substitution on normal hydrogen bonding sites of polydeoxycytidylate drastically reduces affinity for the ribosome, suggesting that some kind of hydrogen bonding between bases is responsible for this type of binding."
