https://openalex.org/W2024338092,"CHEMICAL1 and enzymic2 studies from these two laboratories suggested that coenzyme A is best represented by formula (I) (cf. ref. 3). While the synthesis of various fragments of the molecule4 has lent considerable support to this structure, the enzymic and chemical evidence did not agree on one point. This concerned the nature of a substance obtained by the action of nucleotide pyrophosphatase on the coenzyme and which stimulated the growth of Acetobacter suboxydans5. Although not isolated in a chemically pure state, it was thought to be a simple phosphate of pantothenic acid6. None of the synthetic pantothenic acid phosphates showed activity towards this organism ; consequently, it was suggested1 that this ‘Acetobacter-stimulatory factor’ might be pantetheine-4′phosphate (II). An unambiguous synthesis of (II) is described here."

In the physiological range of pH, chloroquine exists as an equilibrium mixture of two species which can be designated as B-B’Hf and +HB-B/H+, in which B represents the ring nitrogen and B’ the diethylamino nitrogen of the side chain. Albumin interacts reversibly with species B-B’H+ but does not interact with species +HB-B’H+. The value of the first apparent association exponent, log k’l, was determined to be 3.72 at 30” and ionic strength 1.66. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Irvin, J. L., and Irvin, E. M., J. Biol.

In crude neutral solution, the activation of elastase may be carried out by acidification, dialysis or precipitation with ammonium sulphate1,2. In all these procedures the elastase is being liberated from elastase-inhibitor. It has been pointed out by us that two types of elastase-inhibitor exist, namely, one in the pancreas and another in the blood serum4. Whereas that from the pancreas dialyses in 24–32 hr. and can be demonstrated in the dialysate, that from the serum cannot be dialysed."

https://openalex.org/W101087051,"SUMMARY 1. Crystalline bovine carboxypeptidase was used as an antigen in ob- taining rabbit antisera which contained precipitating antibodies. Studies showed that the system contained only a single antibody and a single antigen as judged by quantitative precipitin tests and by observations with the agar diffusion method. 2. The antibodies interacted slowly with the enzyme to produce a non- competitive inhibition since the extent of inhibition was not influenced by substrate concentration. Moreover, competitive inhibitors of carboxy- peptidase of low molecular weight had no influence on the antigen-antibody interaction. 3. At high temperatures (25-39.5’), the inhibition is described by the equation for an interaction of 1 molecule of antibody for each active site of enzyme. At 6.4”, the data are described by an equation where the enzymatic site reacts with 2 molecules of antibody."

https://openalex.org/W2034668782,"THE type mandible of Telanthropus capensis was found in the Swartkrans excavation in April 1949 by me. Dr. R. Broom and I published a preliminary description in this journal1. In this note the opinion was expressed that this form is “intermediate between one of the ape-men and true man”. This conclusion has been somewhat sceptically received by most workers, who consider, in view of the fact that the same excavation has yielded numerous remains of the ape-man Paranthropus crassidens, that the specimen is more likely to be a small and slightly aberrant P. crassidens than a new type of man."
