https://openalex.org/W2162306092,"Chromatin rearrangements in the meiotic prophase are characterized by the assembly and disassembly of synaptonemal complexes (SC), a protein structure that stabilizes the pairing of homologous chromosomes in prophase. We report the identification of human and mouse cDNA coding for stromalin 3 (STAG3), a new mammalian stromalin member of the synaptonemal complex. The stromalins are a group of highly conserved proteins, represented in several organisms from yeast to humans. Stromalins are characterized by the stromalin conservative domain (SCD), a specific motif found in all proteins of the family described to date. STAG3 is expressed specifically in testis, and immunolocalization experiments show that STAG3 is associated to the synaptonemal complex. As the protein encoded by the homologous gene (Scc3p) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to be a subunit of a cohesin complex that binds chromosomes until the onset of anaphase, our data suggest that STAG3 is involved in chromosome pairing and maintenance of synaptonemal complex structure during the pachytene phase of meiosis in a cohesin-like manner. We have mapped the human STAG3 gene to the 7q22 region of chromosome 7; six human STAG3-related genes have also been mapped: two at 7q22 near the functional gene, one at 7q11.22, and three at 7q11.23, two of them flanking the breakpoints commonly associated with the Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) deletion. Since the WBS deletion occurs as a consequence of unequal meiotic crossing over, we suggest that STAG3 duplications predispose to germline chromosomal rearrangement within this region."

A test pattern of ridges and channels with length scales (40 to 310 μηι) similar to the invaginations found in a native basal lamina was laser machined into the surface of a polyimide master chip. Negative replicates of the chip were produced using polydimethylsiloxane silicone elastomer and these replicates were used as templates for the production of thin (~21 um) membranes of collagen or gelatin. The resulting membranes had a complex topography of ridges and channels that recapitulated the features of the master chip. To demonstrate their utility, these complex membranes were laminated to type I collagen sponges and their surfaces were seeded with cultured human epidermal keratinocytes to form a skin equivalent. The keratinocytes formed a differentiated and stratified epidermis that conformed to the features of the microfabricated membrane. The topography of the membrane influenced the differentiation of the keratinocytes because stratification was enhanced in the deeper channels. Membrane topography also controlled the gross surface features of the skin equivalent; infolds of the epidermis increased as channel depth increased. These novel microfabricated analogs of the basal lamina will help to elucidate the influence of topography on epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation and should have applications in the tissue engineering of skin equivalents as well as other basal lamina-containing tissues.—Pins, G.

https://openalex.org/W1522526317,"Antiflammin-1 and antiflammin-2 are nonapeptides corresponding to the region of highest similarity between glucocorticoid-inducible proteins lipocortin-1 and uteroglobin. We have studied whether antiflammins could affect expression of adhesion molecules on human leukocytes and coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and binding of neutrophils (PMNs) to HCAEC. Although neither antiflammin-1 nor antiflammin-2 affected expression of adhesion molecules on resting PMNs, monocytes, and lymphocytes in whole blood, they attenuated changes in L-selectin and CD11/CD18 expression evoked by platelet-activating factor or interleukin-8 with IC50 values of 4–20 μmol/l. The maximum inhibition was similar to those seen with human recombinant lipocortin-1 (100 μg/ml). Unlike dexa-methasone (100 nmol/l), the antiflammins had little effect on LPS-stimulated expression of E-selectin and ICAM-1 on HCAEC. Consistently, culture of HCAEC with dexamethasone, but not with antiflam-mins, decreased PMN binding to endothelial cells. Preincubation of PMNs with antiflammins markedly decreased their adhesion to LPS-activated HCAEC. Inhibition of adhesion was additive with function blocking anti-E-selectin and anti-L-selectin antibodies, but was not additive with anti-CD18 antibody. These results show that antiflammins inhibit PMN adhesion to HCAEC by attenuating activation-induced up-regulation of CD11/CD18 expression on leukocytes, and suggest that antiflammins may represent a novel therapeutic approach in blocking leukocyte trafficking in host defense and inflammation.—Zouki, C., Ouellet, S., Filep, J. G. The antiinflammatory peptides, antiflammins, regulate the expression of adhesion molecules on human leukocytes and prevent neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells. FASEB J. 14, 572–580 (2000)"
https://openalex.org/W2119627924,"Psoriasis is a T cell-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by hyperproliferation and by aberrant differentiation. We found cathepsin D and zinc-alpha(2)-glycoprotein, two catalytic enzymes associated with apoptosis and desquamation, to be present in the stratum corneum of the normal epidermis but absent from the psoriatic plaque. Psoriasis is characterized by an altered response to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), including the induction of apoptosis in normal but not in psoriatic keratinocytes, often with opposite effects on gene expression of suprabasal proteins. We found that IFN-gamma binding and signaling were attenuated in psoriasis: The IFN-gamma receptor, the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT-1, and the interferon regulatory factor IRF-1 were strongly up-regulated by IFN-gamma in normal keratinocytes, but not in psoriatic ones. IFN-gamma strongly up-regulated the expression of the catalytic enzymes cathepsin D and zinc-alpha(2)-glycoprotein in normal keratinocytes but down-regulated them in psoriatic ones; the reverse was true of the apoptotic suppressor bcl-2. We believe that the aberrant response to IFN-gamma plays a central role in the pathophysiology of psoriasis, particularly the disruption of apoptosis and desquamation."
https://openalex.org/W1577921631,"An unusual nucleotide sequence, called H10, was previously isolated by biopanning with a random peptide library on filamentous phage. The sequence encoded a peptide that bound to the growth hormone binding protein. Despite the fact that the H10 sequence can be expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion to the gene III minor coat protein of the M13 phage, the sequence contained two TGA stop codons in the zero frame. Several mutant derivatives of the H10 sequence carried not only a stop codon, but also showed frameshifts, either +1 or -1 in individual isolates, between the H10 start and the gene III sequences. In this work, we have subcloned the H10 sequence and three of its derivatives (one requiring a +1 reading frameshift for expression, one requiring a -1 reading frameshift, and one open reading frame) in gene fusions to a reporter beta-galactosidase gene. These sequences have been cloned in all three reading frames relative to the reporter. The non-open reading frame constructs gave (surprisingly) high expression of the reporter (10-40% of control vector expression levels) in two out of the three frames. A site-directed mutant of the TGA stop codon (to TTA) in the +1 shifter greatly reduced the frameshift and gave expression primarily in the zero frame. By contrast, a site-directed mutant of the TGA in the -1 shifter had little effect on the pattern of expression, and alteration of the first TGA (of two) in H10 itself paradoxically reduced expression by half. We believe these phenomena to reflect a translational recoding mechanism in which ribosomes switch reading frames or read past stop codons upon encountering a signal encoded in the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA, because both the open reading frame derivative (which has six nucleotide changes from parental H10) and the site-directed mutant of the +1 shifter, primarily expressed the reporter only in the zero frame."
