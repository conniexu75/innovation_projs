https://openalex.org/W2016099951,The effect of electrical stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation upon patterns of discharge of single lateral geniculate neurons was studied. Data were processed by means of a 256-channel scaler analyzer. The rate of spontaneous discharge of geniculate neurons was raised by electrical stimulation of the reticular formation and their ability to respond to intermittent light was enhanced.

https://openalex.org/W147081224,"Changes in porphyrin metabolism attributable to diethyl-1 ,4dihydro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate (DTD)’ were first reported by Solomon and Figge in 1959 (I, 2). After the oral administration of the compound to mice and guinea pigs, increased concentrations of liver coproporphyrin and protoporphyrin and renal uroporphyrin and protoporphyrin were observed. Urine analyses revealed increased coproporphyrin, traces of porphobilinogen, and no significant change in uroporphyrin. Such observations on the effects of DTD are of added interest when considered in light of the extensive work that has been done on experimental porphyria induced by Sedormid and related compounds. Recently, comparisons have been made of the changes in porphyrin metabolism due to DTD with alterations found in Sedormidor 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide-induced porphyria. The conclusions, which were based largely on porphyrin and precursor excretion patterns, were in disagreement as to the manner in which these different compounds affected porphyrin metabolism. Haeger-Aronsen (3) suggested that DTD-induced porphyria in rabbits differed from Sedormidinduced porphyria, principally in terms of a greater urinary cscretion of &aminolevulinic acid. deMatteis and Prior (4), on the other hand, concluded that the experimental porphyrias induced by DTD and Sedormid in rats were probably indistinguishable. In other reports, concerned primarily with b-aminolevulinic acid synthesis (5, 6), DTD has simply been referred to as a porphyria-inducing agent and is presumed to act like Sedormid and related compounds. However, an examination of the DTD molecule reveals that the essential groupings to induce a 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide or Sedormid type of porphyria are absent, and on this basis a different metabolic effect might be expected (7-10). For these reasons, a further investigation of DTD was carried out, but in this instance added emphasis has been placed on metabolism within the liver cell and on subcellular fractions. The results obtained indicate that the inhibition of iron-protoporphyrin chelation is at least one site of action of the compound. Some effects on porphyrin and iron metabolism are compared with those found in 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamideinduced porphyria."

Reliable differences in skin resistance were found in three subjects and in galvanic skin response in two subjects. The magnitude of the skin resistance difference was significantly reduced in four subjects during stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W2028820265,"GUINEA pig serum is known to exert a striking inhibitory effect on certain transplantable leukaemias of the mouse and rat1. Suppression may be seen, not only with long transplanted leukaemias, but also with recently derived spontaneous and radiation-induced leukaemias (preceding communication). Other sera have been tested, but none has shown unequivocal activity1,2. The only rodent other than the guinea pig, the serum of which has been examined and found to be negative, is the rat2. Up to the present time, however, no animal closely related to the guinea pig has been studied."

https://openalex.org/W2075422412,"Pepsin-digested rabbit antibody (5S) provoked reverse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in the guinea pig, but was somewhat less effective, mole for mole, than the native antibody. Fixation of guinea pig complement by the pepsin-digested antibody could not be demonstrated either in vitro or in vivo. Splitting of the 5S fragment into two monovalent fragments (3.5S) markedly reduced the capacity to provoke reverse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis."

https://openalex.org/W2088719401,"A marked difference was observed between the effectiveness of high and low dose rates of ionizing radiation in producing persistent chromosome aberrations in the marrow cells of mice. Clones of cells with chromosome abnormalities were present in the marrow of all the mice previously exposed to single or fractionated doses of x-rays given at a rate of 30 rad/min. The frequency of chromosome aberrations in these mice varied from 14 to 72 percent of the cells exdmined. By contrast, none of the mice exposed to continuous gamma radiation at a low dose rate (1.45 rad/hour) showed definite clones of abnormal marrow cells, and the frequency of persistent chromosome aberrations varied from zero to 8 percent in this group."

https://openalex.org/W196826293,"We do not mean to imply that research on individual differences in word usage is easy or that investigations typically meet with success. Many studies have failed, either because no reliable categories of words were found or, if such categories were found, because no significant correlations were obtained with other forms of behavior. Only the naïve would expect to find more than rather small correlations between individual differences in learning, perception, and social behavior and differences in word usage. Human behavior is so complexly determined that it is illogical to expect various kinds of individual differences to correlate highly. In order to document such small correlations it is necessary to work with relatively large samples of subjects. Usually 300 subjects or more are required for a study."

https://openalex.org/W1987597437,"DURING an investigation of the physiology of the pitcher of Nepenthes, methods suitable for a field laboratory were required for estimating amino-acids produced during ‘digestion’ and for estimating the uptake of amino-acids by the pitcher. The ninhydrin reaction in its usual form was too slow (Milton and Waters1 specify 100° C for 1 h) and the only colorimeter available was unsuited to field use."

https://openalex.org/W2072250389,"THE appearance of non-immune precipitin bands in gel diffusion tests may result from manipulation of the physical environment while the immuno-diffusion test is in progress1. Interactions of serum with granulocytes2 and tissue extracts3, or reaction of albumin with hæmoglobin4 though not antigen–antibody reactions also produce precipitates in agar. When one of the react ants can express a second biological function other than its anti-genicity under the conditions of the gel test, then such non-specific precipitin lines are likely to occur. Our experience with bovine carboxypeptidase A and its rabbit antiserum ultimately revealed two independent artefacts of a type we had not seen referred to elsewhere."

Although platelets are the main source of histamine and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in blood2, nothing is known of the free amino-acids therein. It was thus of interest to determine the total free amino-acid content of platelets and to identify individual components."

It is therefore pertinent that such compounds as 3β-methoxyandrost-5-en-16β-ol5,6 having a strong cytostatic activity should be investigated with regard to their effect on reticulo-endothelial phagocytosis."

White male rats of the laboratory strain weighing 150–200 g were divided into three groups : the first group containing 10 rats formed controls, the second and third groups consisted of 20 rats each. The animals wore fed by a standard diet and accepted water ad libitum."
