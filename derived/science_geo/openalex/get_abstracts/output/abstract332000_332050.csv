https://openalex.org/W2037041276,"Oscillations of Pinus (pine) pollen in a 50,000-year sequence from Lake Tulane, Florida, indicate that there were major vegetation shifts during the last glacial cycle. Episodes of abundant Pinus populations indicate a climate that was more wet than intervening phases dominated by Quercus (oak) and Ambrosia-type (ragweed and marsh-elder). The Pinus episodes seem to be temporally correlated with the North Atlantic Heinrich events, which were massive, periodic advances of ice streams from the eastern margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Possible links between the Tulane Pinus and Heinrich events include hemispheric cooling, the influences of Mississippi meltwater on sea-surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, and the effects of North Atlantic thermohaline circulation on currents in the Gulf."
https://openalex.org/W2106385662,"The natural color pattern of individuals of the unpalatable and mimetic butterfly Heliconius erato was altered to a unique nonmimetic pattern. When returned to natural populations, the nonmimetic individuals remained for shorter periods of time and received more wing damage indicative of predator attacks than did the controls. The results indicate that Müllerian mimicry was functioning to protect the butterflies from predation."
https://openalex.org/W2073815847,"Dense stands of a woody, successional species, Prunus pensylvanica L., develop rapidly, with early closure of canopy and rapid attainment of high values of net annual production and nutrient accumulation. Such rapid growth following disturbance tends to minimize losses of nutrients from the ecosystem, thus promoting a return to steady-state cycling characteristic of a mature forest."
https://openalex.org/W1998268326,"The Landers, California, earthquake of 28 June 1992 (magnitude = 7.3) is the latest of six significant earthquakes in the past 60 years whose epicenters and slip directions define a 100-kilometer alignment running approximately N15°W across the central Mojave region. This pattern may indicate a geologically young throughgoing fault that replaces numerous older strike-slip faults by obliquely cutting across them. These older faults, and perhaps also the bend in the San Andreas fault, may be losing their ability to accommodate upper crustal deformation because they have become unfavorably oriented with respect to the regional stress field."
https://openalex.org/W2029888174,"Tracks attributed to the spontaneous fission of plutonium-244 and of uranium-238 were detected in a large whitlockite crystal in the lunar breccia 14321 from the Fra Mauro formation. For a track-retention age of 3.95 x 10(9) years the number of plutonium tracks relative to the number of uranium tracks is 0.51 +/- 0.15, provided that the rock was not heavily neutron-irradiated 3.95 X 10(9) years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2021398831,The asteroid 1685 Toro has its perihelion inside the Earth's orbit and a period which is 8/ 5 of that of the Earth. A calculation of Toro's orbit covering 200 years shows that this asteroid at present is captured in resonance with the Earth. The capture is due to the gravitational interaction at close encounters between the bodies.
