https://openalex.org/W2036581427,"Evidence is presented to indicate that placebos are far more effective in producing carefully defined relief of pathological pain than they are in the case of experimental pain. This is construed as further support for the view that placebos are more effective when stress is great than they are when stress is not so great. A similar situation holds for morphine. Certain drugs are effective in relieving visceral sensations only if an essential psychological state is present. This is, in effect, a new principle of drug action."

Division of at least 91 percent of the population was made to occur in 1/24 of the life cycle of the cells. The advantages of working with synchronized cultures of obligate autotrophs are discussed.

The result is in keeping with the idea that urethan acts as a promoting factor in leukemogenesis, as defined by the twostage mechanism hypothesis of carcinogenesis. It may also have a practical bearing on leukemia development in man."

https://openalex.org/W2014764827,"A theory for the rapid specific reaction of certain phosphorous-containing esters with many proteolytic enzymes based on the ability of phosphorous to form one additional bond relative to carbon is presented. A stable tetrahedral phosphate ester is compared with a labile tetrahedral orthocarbonyl ester and a relatively stable pentagonal enzyme-phosphate ester complex is compared with a pentagonal enzyme-carbonyl substrate complex. The latter complex is assumed to be the transition state in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. If the theory is correct, it opens up the possibility of studying intermediates and transition states from the known structures of chemical inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1978712894,"Death of mice occurs 2 to 8 hours after intravenous inoculation of concentrated viable elementary bodies of trachoma. Toxic death can be prevented by vaccinating the mice with concentrated suspensions of homologous strains inactivated by formalin or phenol. Judged by toxic challenges, at least two antigenically distinct types of elementary bodies of trachoma occur in Saudi Arabia and Egypt."

No change was observed in the course of posttetanic potentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2120212737,"New findings indicate that hormones may play a permissive role, rather than an inductive one, in mammary tumorigenesis. Hormones supporting normal gland development may result in the emergence of precancerous lesions; hormones maintaining such hyperplastic lesions may result in the emergence of tumors. The ""inherited hormonal influence"" may rest in genetically determined sensitivity of mammary tissue to somatotropin."

https://openalex.org/W155347316,The respiratory computer described here makes it possible to obtain more accurate and precise alveolar ventilation-PCO2 response curves than formerly and with fewer man-hours of labor. It is hoped that the ease of obtaining these response curves will lead to their more frequent use in evaluating respiratory phenomena. Clinical applications in evaluating the effects of changes in compliance and airway resistance on respiration are readily apparent. This technique is being used to study the degree of respiratory depression caused by narcotics and anesthetics and to study the effects of stimulating drugs. Respiratory stimulation and depression in a variety of disease states are also being pursued.

https://openalex.org/W2316778111,"A NUMBER of well-defined physico-chemical differences exist between human adult and fœtal hæmoglobins. These include their electrophoretic and chromatographic behaviour under defined conditions, a large difference in alkali denaturation rates, and the changed position and contour of the tryptophan fine-structure band."

A second lever delivered food only during critical tone periods. Animals were able to discriminate tones presented concurrently with rewarding intracranial stimulation, and they also interrupted self-stimulation behavior to respond appropriately under other reinforcements."

https://openalex.org/W2027707230,SEGAL AND BLOCH showed that non-proliferating suspensions of human tubercle bacilli grown in vivo (LRv) exhibited different biochemical properties as compared with the same strain of tubercle bacilli grown in vitro: (a) they had a lower hydrogen transfer capacity; (b) glucose and its intermediates failed to cause an increase over their endogenous respiration1.

https://openalex.org/W2078136340,"Marsdenia erecta is a plant which grows in Turkey as well as the Near East. Recently some of us1 have studied the morphological and chemical properties of this plant and isolated a glycoside—marsdenin. To identify the sugar contents of this glycoside and compare with the sugars of the other Marsdenia glycosides, we obtained the glycoside, hydrolysed it and identified its sugars by paper chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1976501669,"BENOIT, Leroy, Vendrely and Vendrely1,2,3,4 have described changes in the pigmentation of the Pekin duckling after injection of deoxyribonucleic acid from the Khaki-Campbell drake, which they interpreted as a somatic mutation. Perry and Walker5 and Bearn and Kirby6 have repeated similar work in the rat and failed to produce any change. Hewer and Meek7 injected young mice with deoxyribonucleic acid from herring sperm, and within 23 days produced death from malignant disease of the intestine. Leuchtenberger, Leuchtenberger and Uyeki8 produced cytological changes in the livers of mice by intraperitoneal injection of deoxyribonucleic acid prepared from breast cancers of C

H mice. This work has now been repeated in the rat using deoxyribonucleic acid prepared from rat sarcoma and rat hepatoma."

https://openalex.org/W1964052295,"THE lizard Trachysaurus rugosus has been shown to tolerate very high plasma sodium concentrations, for example, 240 m. equiv./l., both in its natural habitat during summer and in the laboratory after the injection of sodium chloride solution1. The injected sodium chlorate reached osmotic equilibrium with the total body water but electrolyte changes inside the cells were not determined. The nucleated erythrocytes of Trachysaurus offered a useful starting point for intracellular studies in vivo. It has been shown in vitro that the sodium concentration in the nucleated erythrocytes of the turtle is actively maintained by respiration2."

https://openalex.org/W2002901240,"In the method presented here for the correction of sample absorption of C(14) activity, the only requirement is the availability of any C(14)-labeled compound of sufficiently high specific activity to permit addition, in negligible mass, of a number of counts equal to or greater than that in unknown samples and with solubility characteristics that exclude preferential layering during drying of samples. The principle may be applied to liquid scintillation counting. Absorption curves are dispensed with, and the weights of the assayed samples need not be determined."
