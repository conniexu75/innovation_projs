Central to the changes in gene expression, eIF2 phosphorylation also enhances translation of ATF4, a transcriptional activator of genes subject to the integrated stress response (ISR). The ISR increases the expression of genes important for alleviating stress or alternatively triggering apoptosis. One ISR target gene encodes the transcriptional regulator CHOP whose accumulation is critical for stress-induced apoptosis. In this study, we show that eIF2 phosphorylation induces preferential translation of CHOP by a mechanism involving a single upstream ORF (uORF) located in the 5′-leader of the CHOP mRNA. In the absence of stress and low eIF2 phosphorylation, translation of the uORF serves as a barrier that prevents translation of the downstream CHOP coding region. Enhanced eIF2 phosphorylation during stress facilitates ribosome bypass of the uORF due to its poor start site context, and instead it allows scanning ribosomes to translate CHOP. This new mechanism of translational control explains how expression of CHOP and the fate of cells are tightly linked to the levels of phosphorylated eIF2 and stress damage.

Biol. Chem. 2011, 286, 10939–10949 Full-Text PDF Open Access Rapid changes in global and gene-specific translation occur in response to many different environmental stresses.

A central mechanism for this translational control involves phosphorylation of eIF2 (eIF2∼P) by the protein kinase PERK/PEK. eIF2 is a translation initiation factor that combines with initiator Met-tRNAiMet and GTP and participates in the selection of the start codon (1Sonenberg N.

Phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2 at Ser-51 in response to ER stress blocks the exchange of eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP, thus reducing global translation initiation and subsequent protein synthesis.

Accompanying this repression of global translational initiation, eIF2∼P selectively enhances the translation of ATF4 mRNA, encoding a basic zipper transcriptional activator of stress-related genes involved in metabolism, protection against oxidative damage, and regulation of apoptosis (3Ron D.

The idea that ATF4 is a common downstream target that integrates signaling from PERK and other eIF2 kinases has led to the eIF2∼P/ATF4 pathway being collectively referred to as the integrated stress response (ISR) (4Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). Preferential translation of ATF4 mRNA during eIF2∼P occurs by a mechanism involving two upstream ORFs (uORFs) (6Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol.

The 5′-proximal uORF1 is a positive-acting element that enables ribosomes to reinitiate translation at a downstream ORF in the ATF4 transcript (8Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). When eIF2-GTP is readily available in nonstressed cells, ribosomes completing translation of uORF1 resume scanning downstream and reinitiate at the next coding region, uORF2, which is an inhibitory element that blocks ATF4 expression. During stress conditions, eIF2∼P and the lowered levels of eIF2-GTP increase the time required for the scanning ribosomes to reinitiate translation. Delayed reinitiation allows for ribosomes to scan through the inhibitory uORF2 and instead translate the ATF4 coding region (8Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). Elevated ATF4 levels induce additional basic zipper transcriptional regulators, such as CHOP/GADD153 and ATF3, which together direct a program of gene expression important for cellular remediation or, alternatively, apoptosis (4Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol.

The mechanism of delayed translation reinitiation in response to eIF2∼P is also central for control of GCN4, a transcriptional activator of genes subject to the general amino acid control in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (11Hinnebusch A.G.

How are the ATF4-targeted ISR transcripts translated when there is repression of general protein synthesis as a consequence of eIF2∼P? One answer to this question is that ATF4 increases the expression of GADD34, which facilitates feedback control of the eIF2 kinase response by targeting the type 1 Ser/Thr protein phosphatase for dephosphorylation of eIF2∼P (10Marciniak S.J.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). The resulting lowered eIF2∼P then allows for resumption of protein synthesis following the reprogramming of the stress-related transcriptome. However, many of the ISR gene products are highly expressed coincident with robust eIF2∼P, and their expression is central for implementation of the stress response pathway. For example, there are high levels of CHOP protein during ER or nutritional stress, whereas translation initiation is still repressed (9Jiang H.Y. Wek S.A. McGrath B.C. Lu D. Hai T. Harding H.P. Wang X. Ron D. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1365-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 18Zhou D. Palam L.R. Jiang L. Narasimhan J. Staschke K.A. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7064-7073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CHOP expression has been suggested to be required for the transcriptional activation of GADD34 (17Marciniak S.J. Yun C.Y. Oyadomari S. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Jungreis R. Nagata K. Harding H.P. Ron D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). This suggests that CHOP and other ISR target genes are subject to preferential translation when eIF2∼P levels are high (19Dang Do A.N. Kimball S.R. Cavener D.R. Jefferson L.S. Physiol. Genomics. 2009; 38: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Chen Y.J. Tan B.C. Cheng Y.Y. Chen J.S. Lee S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 764-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Supporting this idea, CHOP mRNA is associated with polysomes during amino acid starvation (19Dang Do A.N. Kimball S.R. Cavener D.R. Jefferson L.S. Physiol. Genomics. 2009; 38: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The extent and duration of CHOP protein synthesis are thought to be central for altering the ISR from an adaptive pathway that alleviates cellular injury to one that is maladaptive, thus triggering apoptosis (3Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4879) Google Scholar, 21Rutkowski D.T. Arnold S.M. Miller C.N. Wu J. Li J. Gunnison K.M. Mori K. Sadighi Akha A.A. Raden D.

This study demonstrates that CHOP mRNA is subject to preferential translation during stress and describes a new mechanism for preferential translation in response to eIF2∼P. The CHOP mechanism of translational control involves a single uORF that blocks translation in the 5′-leader of the CHOP mRNA. However, with eIF2∼P induced by stress, scanning ribosomes bypass the inhibitory uORF by a process suggested to involve reduced efficiency of translation at initiation codons with a poor Kozak consensus sequence. This study indicates that eIF2∼P can regulate multiple mechanisms of preferential translation involving uORFs, and these mechanisms direct key ISR genes central to cell survival during stress conditions. A HindIII-NcoI DNA fragment encoding the 5′-leader of the CHOP mRNA, along with the initiation codon of the CHOP coding region, was inserted between the HindIII and NcoI restriction sites in a derivative of plasmid pGL3. The resulting TK-CHOP-Luc plasmid contains this 5′-leader sequence of CHOP fused to a luciferase reporter downstream of a constitutive TK promoter. Primer sequences used in this construct were as follows: sense 5′-GCTCAAGCTTGTTATCTTGAGCCTAACACGTCGATTAT-3′ and antisense 5′-TCATGAGTGCCATGACTGCACGTGG-3′. The ATG1 and ATG2 codons of the CHOP uORF were mutated individually or in combination to AGG in the PTK-CHOP-Luc plasmid, and this and subsequent mutations were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. To extend the uORF to overlap out-of-frame with the luciferase coding region, the encoded stop codon TGA in the uORF of TK-CHOP-Luc was mutated to GGA. Codon 24 (AGA) in the uORF of PTK-CHOP-Luc was mutated to TGA to generate the luciferase reporter with a shortened version of the uORF, which encoded amino acid residues 1–23. All plasmids were sequenced to ensure that there were only desired changes. Sequence changes upstream of the CHOP uORF involved the introduction of a PstI restriction site 10 nucleotides upstream of the uORF in PTK-CHOP-Luc plasmid. A previously described stem-loop structure 5′-CTGCAGCCACCACGGCCCCCAAGCTTGGGCCGTGGTGGCTGCAG-3′, with a ΔG value of −41 kcal/mol, was then inserted into the PstI site of the modified PTK-CHOP-Luc plasmid. Alternatively, an extension of the 5′-leader was achieved by inserting a 120-nucleotide sequence into the PstI site. This sequence was devoid of any start and stop codons or predicted strong secondary structures. The initiation codon context from the uORF1 of ATF4 that shares a Kozak consensus was substituted for the first four codons, including the ATG1 and ATG2, of the CHOP uORF in the in PTK-CHOP-Luc plasmid, generating PTK-ATGATF4-CHOP-Luc. This substitution involved replacing the TATATCATGTTGAAGATGA sequence in the CHOP uORF with GCCACCATGG. These substitutions were carried out by the sequence and ligation-independent cloning method (23Li M.Z. Elledge S.J. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The CHOP mRNA sequences from nucleotide 1 to 133 containing the entire coding region of the CHOP uORF were inserted in-frame with the firefly luciferase coding region in a modified version of pGL3. The resulting plasmid PTK-uORF-Luc expressed the uORF-Luc fusion protein from the TK promoter. Deletions in PTK-uORF-Luc were constructed with in-frame deletions of the CHOP uORF codons 14–34 (Δ14–34), 14–23 (Δ14–23), and 23–34 (Δ24–34). A version of the Δ24–34 version of the PTK-uORF-Luc was also constructed with the uORF1 of ATF4 substituted for the first four codons, including the ATG1 and ATG2, of the CHOP uORF portion of the fusion protein. MEF cells that were derived from S/S (wild-type eIF2α) and A/A (mutant eIF2α-S51A) mice were previously described (24Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 25Jiang H.Y. Wek S.A. McGrath B.C. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5651-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). MEF cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mm nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C. ER stress was induced in MEF cells by the addition of either 0.1 or 1 μm thapsigargin to the medium, followed by incubation for up to 12 h, as indicated. Plasmid transfections were performed using the S/S and A/A MEF cells grown to 40% confluency and the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Co-transfections were carried out in triplicate using wild-type or mutant versions of the TK-CHOP-Luc or TK-uORF-Luc plasmids and a Renilla luciferase plasmid serving as an internal control (Promega). 24 h after transfection, MEF cells were treated with 0.1 μm thapsigargin for 12 h or with no ER stress. Shorter periods of time, from 4 to 6 h of stress, also showed significant elevation of CHOP-Luc expression in response to ER stress that supported the stated conclusions. Dual-Luciferase assays were carried out as described by the Promega instruction manual. Values are a measure of a ratio of firefly versus Renilla luciferase units (relative light units) and represent the mean values of three independent transfections. Renilla luciferase values did not change significantly in the dual reporter assays. Results are presented as means ± S.D. that were derived from three independent experiments. Parallel to the Dual-Luciferase assays, the amount of firefly luciferase mRNA in each transfected condition was measured by the qRT-PCR method. MEF cells cultured in the indicated stress conditions or no stress were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), followed by lysis using a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 100 mm NaF, 17.5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10% glycerol supplemented with protease inhibitors (100 μm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm of pepstatin). Lysates were subjected to sonication for 30 s and precleared by centrifugation. Protein content was determined by using a Bio-Rad protein quantitation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Molecular weight markers were included for size determination of proteins in the immunoblot analyses. Transferred filters were then incubated in TBS-T solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20 supplemented with 4% nonfat milk, followed by incubation with TBS-T solution containing the primary antibody specific to the indicated protein. ATF4 antibody was prepared against recombinant protein (18Zhou D. Palam L.R. Jiang L. Narasimhan J. Staschke K.A. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7064-7073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). CHOP (sc-7351) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and β-actin monoclonal antibody (A5441) was purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated eIF2α at Ser-51 was purchased from BioSource (44-728G). Monoclonal antibody that recognizes either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated forms of eIF2α was provided by Dr. Scot Kimball (Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey). Cell lysates from MEF cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were blotted for firefly luciferase protein by using antibody obtained from Promega (G7451). Following incubation of the filters with the indicated antibodies, the filters were then washed three times in TBS-T followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and chemiluminescent substrate. Proteins in the immunoblot were visualized by exposing filters to x-ray film or by imaging using the LI-COR Odyssey system. Images shown in the figures are representative of three independent experiments. The cDNAs corresponding to the 5′-end of the CHOP mRNAs expressed in S/S MEF cells treated with 0.1 μm thapsigargin, or no stress, were amplified by using an RNA ligase-mediated RACE kit (RLM-RACE kit, Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antisense primers corresponding endogenous CHOP mRNA that were used in the assays include the outer primer 5′-GGACGCAGGGTCAAGAGTAG-3′ and inner primer 5′-TCATGAGTGCCATGACTGCACGTGG-3′. The outer primer used for amplifying CHOP-Luc mRNA 5′-end was 5′-CGAATTCGAACACGCAGAT-3′, which was combined with the same inner primer listed above. The amplified product was then analyzed using electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel. The prominent DNA bands were excised, gel-purified, and sequenced. The transcriptional start site was determined as the first nucleotide that is 3′ to the adapter sequence ligated to the 5′ of the mRNA transcripts. MEF cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, treated with the designated stress conditions and harvested, and total cellular RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instruction manual. Contaminating DNA was digested with RNase-free DNase (Promega). Single strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitation of relative mRNA levels was performed using Light Cycler 480 PCR system (Roche Applied Science) and SYBR Green PCR mix from Applied Biosystems. The amount of firefly luciferase mRNA was measured using Renilla luciferase as an internal control. The oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: firefly luciferase 5′-CTCACTGAGACTACATCAGC-3′ and 5′-TCCAGATCCACAACCTTCGC-3′; Renilla luciferase 5′-GGAATTATAATGCTTATCTACGTGC-3′ and 5′-CTTGCGAAAAATGAAGACCTTTTAC-3′. The endogenous CHOP and ATF4 mRNA levels were measured using the following oligonucleotide primers: CHOP 5′-CCTAGCTTGGCTGACAGAGG-3′ and 5′-CTGCTCCTTCTCCTTCATGC-3′; ATF4 5′-GCCGGTTTAAGTTGTGTGCT-3′ and 5′-CTGGATTCGAGGAATGTGCT-3′. Quantitation of target genes was normalized using the reference β-actin. Primers used were 5′-GTATGGAATCCTGTGGCATC-3′ and 5′-AAGCACTTGCGGTGCACGAT-3′. Light Cycler 480 software (version 1.2.9.11) was used to perform quantification and to generate Cp values. Values are a representation of three independent experiments, with standard deviations as indicated. MEF cells were cultured as described above and treated with 1 μm thapsigargin for 6 h or no stress. 10 min prior to harvesting, cells were treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) solution containing 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, and cell lysates were prepared in a solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.4% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cell lysates were passed though a 23-gauge needle and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cell lysate was precleared with brief centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C) and then layered onto a 10–50% sucrose gradient solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 μg/ml cycloheximide. The sucrose gradients were then subjected to centrifugation in a Beckman SW-41Ti rotor for 2 h at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C. A portion of unfractionated cell lysate was used for determining total mRNA levels of CHOP, ATF4, and β-actin. Gradients were fractionated using a Biocomp Gradient Station, and absorbance of RNA at 254 nm was recorded using an in-line UV monitor. Equivalent amounts of synthetic poly(A)+ luciferase RNA (10 ng/ml) purchased from Promega were added to each collected fraction. RNA was isolated from each fraction using the TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen), and synthesis of single-stranded cDNA was performed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prepared cDNA was used to measure the relative mRNA levels for CHOP, ATF4, and encoded β-actin. qRT-PCR data were normalized with the luciferase mRNA that was added prior to RNA isolation. Data represented are the result of three independent experiments with standard deviations as indicated. Alternatively, MEF cells cultured to 40% confluency were transfected with wild-type TK-CHOP-Luc plasmid or mutant variants with ΔATG1 and ΔATG2, individually or in combination, using the FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with 0.1 μm thapsigargin up to 6 h or no stress. Cell lysates prepared were then subjected to sucrose gradient analyses and fractionated as described above. Equivalent amounts of bacterial control RNA (Affymetrix) were added to each sucrose fraction to serve as internal control for the RNA isolation and in qRT-PCR analysis. RNA isolated from each fraction was used in preparation of single strand cDNA synthesis as described. The amount of firefly luciferase in each fraction was quantitated and normalized to the THR mRNA of bacterial control added in the RNA mixture. Oligonucleotide primers used for the THR mRNA measurement were as follows: forward 5′-AGGATGACGAGACCCAAATG-3′ and reverse 5′-TGATCGCAGCAATGAGGATA-3′. In response to ER stress, eIF2∼P triggers preferential translation of ATF4 mRNA concurrent with repressed global translation initiation. This is illustrated by treatment of MEF cells with thapsigargin, a potent ER stress agent (5Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). Within 1 h of thapsigargin exposure, wild-type MEF cells displayed an enhanced eIF2∼P accompanied by increased expression of ATF4 protein (Fig. 1A). By contrast, MEF cells containing Ala for the eIF2α phosphorylation site Ser-51 (A/A) showed no eIF2∼P and minimal levels of ATF4 protein. In addition to translational control, ATF4 was reported to be subject to transcriptional regulation, with a 3-fold increase in ATF4 mRNA following 6 h of the ER stress (Fig. 1B) (26Dey S. Baird T.D. Zhou D. Palam L.R. Spandau D.F. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 33165-33174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This increase in ATF4 mRNA levels in response to ER stress is substantially blocked in the A/A cells. ATF4 is a transcriptional activator of ISR genes, such as CHOP mRNA. Levels of CHOP protein and mRNA are sharply increased in response to ER stress by a mechanism requiring eIF2∼P (Fig. 1, A and B). Given that increased expression of CHOP protein occurs despite high levels of eIF2∼P, we reasoned that translation of CHOP mRNA may be favored even when global translation initiation is severely restricted. To test this idea, we carried out a polysome analysis using sucrose gradient centrifugation. Thapsigargin treatment of MEF cells significantly reduced polysome levels, concomitant with elevated levels of free ribosomes and monosomes, which is consistent with repressed translation initiation (Fig. 2). This reduction in translation initiation is dependent on eIF2∼P, as the polysome profile was largely unchanged when A/A cells were treated with thapsigargin (supplemental Fig. 1). During nonstressed conditions, the levels of ATF4 transcript, measured as the percentage of total ATF4 mRNA, were most abundant in the monosome and small polysome fractions of the sucrose gradient. In this condition, only 28% of the ATF4 mRNAs were associated with large polysomes consisting of transcripts associated with four or more ribosomes. By comparison, upon ER stress, there was a substantial shift of ATF4 transcripts to the large polysome fractions (67% associated with large polysomes), consistent with earlier reports that ATF4 mRNA is preferentially translated upon eIF2∼P (6Harding H.P.

CHOP mRNA displayed a similar distribution pattern in the polysome profiles as the ATF4 transcripts (Fig. 2). In the absence of stress, CHOP mRNA was most abundant in the monosomes and small polysomes, whereas ER stress triggered increased association of this transcript with the large polysomes (25% associated with large polysomes in nonstressed conditions compared with 52% during ER stress). As a control, we also measured actin mRNA among the fractions in the sucrose gradient and found that this transcript was largely insensitive to ER stress. We next addressed whether the 5′-leader of the CHOP mRNA directs translational control in response to ER stress. The transcriptional start site of the CHOP transcript was determined in MEF cells in the presence or absence of stress by 5′-RACE and DNA sequencing (Fig. 3A). Transcription of CHOP occurs at the same site independent of stress conditions, leading to a 5′-leader sequence 162 nucleotides in length. The CHOP leader sequence encodes a single uORF representing a 34-residue polypeptide that is highly conserved among vertebrates (Fig. 3B) (27Jousse C. Bruhat A. Carraro V. Urano F. Ferrara M. Ron D.

Notable among the conserved residues are Met residues at positions 1 and 4 (encoded by codons designated ATG1 and ATG2), providing for two possible initiation codon"
https://openalex.org/W2082216095,"Body change illusions have been of great interest in recent years for the understanding of how the brain represents the body. Appropriate multisensory stimulation can induce an illusion of ownership over a rubber or virtual arm, simple types of out-of-the-body experiences, and even ownership with respect to an alternate whole body. Here we use immersive virtual reality to investigate whether the illusion of a dramatic increase in belly size can be induced in males through (a) first person perspective position (b) synchronous visual-motor correlation between real and virtual arm movements, and (c) self-induced synchronous visual-tactile stimulation in the stomach area.Twenty two participants entered into a virtual reality (VR) delivered through a stereo head-tracked wide field-of-view head-mounted display. They saw from a first person perspective a virtual body substituting their own that had an inflated belly. For four minutes they repeatedly prodded their real belly with a rod that had a virtual counterpart that they saw in the VR. There was a synchronous condition where their prodding movements were synchronous with what they felt and saw and an asynchronous condition where this was not the case. The experiment was repeated twice for each participant in counter-balanced order. Responses were measured by questionnaire, and also a comparison of before and after self-estimates of belly size produced by direct visual manipulation of the virtual body seen from the first person perspective.The results show that first person perspective of a virtual body that substitutes for the own body in virtual reality, together with synchronous multisensory stimulation can temporarily produce changes in body representation towards the larger belly size. This was demonstrated by (a) questionnaire results, (b) the difference between the self-estimated belly size, judged from a first person perspective, after and before the experimental manipulation, and (c) significant positive correlations between these two measures. We discuss this result in the general context of body ownership illusions, and suggest applications including treatment for body size distortion illnesses."

These heterogeneous carbohydrates consist of glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and frequently fucose and/or N-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or sialic acid) residues via several potential glycosidic linkages.

Similarly, enzymatic degradation of acidic HMOs or milk sialyloligosaccharides (MSOs) requires cleavage of terminal α2–6- and α2–3-linked sialyl moieties (1György P. Jeanloz R.W. von Nicolai H. Zilliken F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 43: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Human milk is a rich source of sialylated glycans, previously determined to be over 40 structures (of over 200 total HMOs) representing nearly 16% of soluble oligosaccharide abundances (2Ward R.E.

Biochem. 2007; 370: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast to lactose, the structural organization of HMOs resist host digestive enzymes, thus are introduced intact to microbial communities established along the nursing infant gastrointestinal tract (GIT) (4Engfer M.B. Stahl B. Finke B. Sawatzki G. Daniel H. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Accordingly, HMOs are potent molecular arbiters at the mammalian-microbial interface as they modulate epithelial surface glycan expression and may modulate systemic immune responses (5Bode L. J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 2127-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Moreover, HMOs limit pathogen colonization by mimicking vulnerable host epitopes thus competing for microbial adhesins. A well-studied example is the inhibition of campylobacter-induced diarrhea in infants by α1–2 fucosylated HMO (6Morrow A.L. Ruiz-Palacios G.M. Altaye M. Jiang X. Guerrero M.L. Meinzen-Derr J.K.

Likewise, sialylated glycans are bound by Helicobacter pylori and are known to mitigate Streptococcus pneumoniae adherence to the nasopharyngeal mucosa (8Barthelson R. Mobasseri A. Zopf D. Simon P.

In addition, sialylated milk glycoproteins confer further protection by neutralizing infectious particles such as rotavirus (11Yolken R.H. Peterson J.A. Vonderfecht S.L. Fouts E.T. Midthun K. Newburg D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1984-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). With a few exceptions, the prominence of sialic acids to eukaryotic biology emerged with the deuterostomes and thus microbial interactions denote an evolved commensal, pathogenic, or saprotrophic relationship with animals (12Schauer R.

Therefore milk laden with sialylconjugates may enrich for microbes that deploy sialidases (EC 3.2.1.18) to metabolize otherwise inaccessible or perhaps deleterious sialosides passing through the nursing neonate. This is consistent with the frequent overrepresentation of infant-type bifidobacteria in this habitat, many of which exhibit sialidase activity (15LoCascio R.G. Ninonuevo M.R. Freeman S.L. Sela D.A.

In addition, we have observed that this infant-associated commensal degrades milk sialic acids and metabolizes Neu5Ac via its fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase pathway (19Ward R.E. Niñonuevo M.

Despite this physiological and genomic evidence, the extent to which B. longum subsp. infantis or other microbes consume MSO is uncertain and is the subject of this study reported herein. Accordingly, MSO utilization and preferred acidic oligosaccharides were determined by monitoring temporal fluxes within a pool of fermented HMO. Moreover, two candidate B. longum subsp. infantis sialidases, one or both of which would be rate-limiting in MSO catabolism were characterized. Genome and gene sequence analysis was conducted using The Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system (22Markowitz V.M. Kyrpides N.C. Methods Mol.

Sialidase sequences from GIT inhabiting bacteria were retrieved from IMG corresponding to clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COG4409). Multiple sequence alignment was performed with MUSCLE and manually curated. The phylogeny of 40 sialidase enzyme sequences was inferred by Maximum Likelihood using the JTT matrix-based model (26Tamura K. Dudley J. Nei M. Kumar S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25632) Google Scholar, 27Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 275-282PubMed Google Scholar). 500 replicates were bootstrapped to assess statistical confidence in inferred phylogenetic relationships (28Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Distances reflect the number of amino acid substitutions per position. All gaps and incomplete positions were excluded from the final analysis that yielded 274 aligned positions. B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC15697 cultures were routinely propagated in Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) broth (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) l-cysteine at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. Bacterial DNA was extracted with the MasterPure Gram-positive DNA Purification Kit (Epicenter, Madison, WI) for cloning. Transformed Escherichia coli strains (Top10 and BL21; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were propagated in Luria Broth under selective conditions (100 μg/ml carbenicillin). Plasmids were extracted with Qiagen (Germantown, MD) plasmid mini-prep kits according to the manufacturer's protocols. Sialidase genes Blon_0646 (nanH1) and Blon_2348 (nanH2) were PCR amplified from the ATCC15697 chromosome using a high-fidelity polymerase with the following primer pairs: nanH1: (5′-CACCATGGCAGCATCCAACCGATC & 5′-GTGCGTTTCGGCCGCGCCGAA) and nanH2: (5′-CACCATGACGGAGAACGGGATGATG & 5′-GCACCCTCCCTCACCAGACAG). PCR products were cleaned using the Qiagen Qiaquick cleanup kit, quantified, and cloned into a pET101-D expression vector with the ChampionTM pET101 Directional TOPO® Expression kit (Invitrogen) to yield a polyhistidine fusion protein when expressed. Vectors were propagated in E. coli TOP10 and were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for heterologous expression. The NanH1 expression strain was grown for 4 h subsequent to achieving A600 0.5–0.6 at 30 °C, 250 RPM prior to cell harvest. His-tagged NanH2 overproduction was induced with the addition of 1 mm IPTG at A600 0.5–0.6 at 37 °C, 250 RPM and grown for an additional 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, 5 min of incubation on ice and washed 2× with sterile PBS. Cells were disrupted by chemical lysis using Pierce B-PER (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Sialidase activity was qualitatively confirmed from the soluble cell-free protein with the BVBlue Diagnostic Assay (Genzyme Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA). The soluble cell-free extract was centrifuged from debris and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography with the Pierce HisPur cobalt spin columns (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified His-tagged proteins were eluted with 150 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. Sialidases were inspected by SDS-PAGE to conform to expected molecular weight and quantified by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (29Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Typical enzymatic assays were performed in duplicate in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing a buffer (200 mm) with a pH in the range of 4.0–9.0, Neu5Acα2–3LacβMU, or Neu5Acα2–6LacβMU (1 mm), and NanH1 (Blon_0646, 3.9 μg) or NanH2 (Blon_2348, 24 ng). The buffers used were: NaOAc-HOAc for pH 4.0–6.0 and Tris-HCl for pH 7.0–9.0. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C and were stopped by adding ice-cold 25% acetonitrile to yield a 10-fold dilution. The samples were analyzed by a Shimadzu LC-2010A system equipped with a membrane on-line degasser, a temperature control unit, and a fluorescence detector. A reverse phase Premier C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm I.D., 5 mm particle size, Shimadzu) protected with a C18 guard column cartridge was used. The mobile phase was 25% acetonitrile. The fluorescent compounds LacβMU and Neu5Acα2–3LacβMU (or Neu5Acα2–6LacβMU) were detected with excitation at 325 nm and emission at 372 nm. The enzymatic assays were carried out for at least two individual experiments. Each experiment was performed in duplicate in a total volume of 20 μl in a NaOAc/HOAc buffer (200 mm, pH 5.0) containing Neu5Acα2–3LacβMU or Neu5Acα2–6LacβMU and a recombinant sialidase (3.9 μg of NanH1 or 24 ng of NanH2). Apparent kinetic parameters were obtained by varying the Neu5Acα2–3LacβMU or Neu5Acα2–6LacβMU concentration from 0.1–40.0 mm (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1, 2, 4, 10, 20, and 40 mm). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C. Apparent kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the data (the average values of duplicate assay results) into the Michaelis-Menten equation using Grafit 5.0. The assays were carried out at 37 °C in duplicate in 384-well plates (Fisher Scientific) in a total volume of 20 μl containing NaOAc/HOAc buffer (100 mm, pH 5.0), NanH1 (3.9 μg), or NanH2 (12 ng), a sialoside substrate (0.3 mm), and β-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae (12 μg, 126 mU) (Sigma-Aldrich). The amount of the β-galactosidase required to completely hydrolyze the GalβpNP within the time frame of the assay was predetermined and confirmed by assays using GalβpNP (0.3 mm). The reactions were carried out for 30 min and were stopped by adding CAPS buffer (40 μl, 0.5 m, pH 10.5). The amount of the para-nitrophenolate formed was determined by measuring the A405 nm of the reaction mixtures using a microtiter plate reader. Reactions of GalβpNP (0.3 mm) and β-galactosidase (12 μg, 126 mU) were used as controls. All substrates used in this assay were synthesized previously as reported (43Cao H. Li Y. Lau K. Muthana S.

Milk oligosaccharides were purified from pooled human milk as previously described (2Ward R.E. Niñonuevo M. Mills D.A. Lebrilla C.B. German J.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 4497-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Isolated B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC15697 colonies were cultured in MRS broth and incubated overnight at 37οC in an anaerobic growth chamber (Coy Laboratory Products). The resultant cultures were inoculated at 1% into 200 μl of reconstituted MRS containing 2% HMO instead of glucose as the sole carbohydrate (MRSHMO) and overlaid with 40 μl of sterile mineral oil in a 96-well microtiter plate. Cell growth was monitored in real time by assessing A600 nm using a BioTek PowerWave 340 plate reader (BioTek, Winoosky, VT) every 30 min preceded by 15 s shaking at variable speed. At least two biological replicates were performed for each physiological collection at approximately A600 nm = 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 0.75, and 1.0. Once harvested, culture supernatants were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 30 min, boiled for 5 min, and filtered through a 0.22-μm pore membrane (Millipore) prior to temporary storage at −80 °C. Aliquots of supernatant were chemically reduced and spiked with an aliquot of deuterated growth medium that served as an internal standard and allowed for consumption analysis(2,30). Following reduction, all samples were desalted using porous graphitized carbon Top Tip solid phase extraction cartridges (Glygen, Columbia, MD) and the HMOs were eluted from the cartridge using a 20% CH3CN solution (2Ward R.E. Niñonuevo M. Mills D.A. Lebrilla C.B. German J.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 4497-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The desalted samples were dried in a centrifugal evaporator to dryness and were then reconstituted in 18 mΩ deionized water to a final concentration of 1000 ppm based on the internal standard. Working samples were prepared for mass spectral analysis by dilution of each 1000 ppm sample to 10 ppm using a solution of H2O:MeOH (1:1, v/v) + 5 mm ammonium acetate. All mass spectrometry experiments were performed on an IonSpec 9.4 T QFT Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS) (Lake Forest, CA) equipped with an Advion Nanomate (Ithaca, NY). Control and programming of the QFT FT-ICR MS was performed in the IonSpec Omega software (version 9.1.2) while the Nanomate was controlled using the accompanying ChipSoft software (version 6.4.5). Prior to the analysis of consumption samples, the experimental parameters of the QFT FT-ICR MS were optimized for oligosaccharide analysis and mass accuracy using maltooligosaccharides (31Clowers B.H. Dodds E.D. Seipert R.R. Lebrilla C.B. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 381: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All spectra were collected with a total ion intensity of 150–200 (arbitrary units) and were recorded at a transient length of 1 s and 1024K data points in each transient. Each recorded transient was shortened from 1024K data points to 256K data points and then internally calibrated to the ions corresponding to the deuterated sialylated HMOs, bringing the measured mass error to less than 10 ppm (32Dodds E.D. Tassone F. Hagerman P.J. Lebrilla C.B. Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 5533-5540Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The masses and their associated intensities were copied as a mass-intensity (MI) table from the Omega software into Microsoft Excel 2007 for further data analysis. The MI table was searched for the monoisotopic and 13C peaks of the sialylated HMOs of interest using a custom Excel macro (33Dodds E.D. German J.B. Lebrilla C.B. Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 9547-9556Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly this macro compares an experimental MI table to a user-defined list of masses of interest and returns those experimental masses, and their intensities, matching the defined list. The percent consumption of each sialylated HMO was calculated using the ratio of the intensities of deuterated internal standard to the sample HMO (D/H ratio) for a consumption sample and a control sample. In calculating the D/H ratio for a given HMO the 13C contribution of the HMO must be removed from the intensity of the internal standard HMO. The IonSpec Exact Mass Calculator software (version 9.0.15) was used to calculate the isotopic distribution of the sample HMOs as percentages of the monoisotopic peak. In this manner the contribution of the 13C peak for the sample HMO could be subtracted from the intensity of the internal standard monoisotopic peak. This is shown in Equation 1, in which ID is the measured intensity for the deuterated HMO internal standard, IH is the intensity for the reduced HMO, and k is a waiting factor adjusting for the 13C contribution of the reduced HMO to the intensity of the deuterated HMO (2Ward R.E.

All bacteria were cultured anaerobically at 37 °C. Mid-log cells (∼A600 nm = 0.5) were harvested on ice, centrifuged at 4 °C followed by the addition of RNAlater (Ambion Inc.) to the aspirated cell pellet following manufacturer's protocols. Cell pellets stored at −20 °C were resuspended in 250 μl of lysozyme (50 mg/ml) and 120 μl of mutanolysin (1000 units/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to the introduction lysis/binding solution from Ambion's RNAqeous kit used to extract total RNA according to manufacturer's protocols. RNA was cleaned with a Qiagen RNeasy kit prior to cDNA synthesis using random hexamers and Superscript II reverse-transcriptase (Invitrogen) following DNase treatment. 5′ nuclease assay (TaqMan) primers and probes were designed with the PRIMEREXPRESS software (Applied Biosytems) targeting nanH1 and nanH2 sequences and are listed in supplemental Table S1. RT-qPCR was performed on an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System using the fast reagents and protocol as directed and supplied by Applied Biosystems. The sequence encoding a cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (Blon_0393) was targeted as a reference as it is constitutively expressed under several culture conditions and verified for our ATCC15697 laboratory strain (34Parche S. Beleut M. Rezzonico E. Jacobs D. Arigoni F. Titgemeyer F. Jankovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1260-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by the ΔΔCt method to determine relative expression by normalizing target values to the reference. p values were determined by a 2-tailed, type 3 t test. MSOs were isolated from pooled HMO by solid phase extraction (SPE) and HPLC. A fraction containing two abundant MSO species were used for sialidase digestion. Disialyl-lacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT) possessing both α2–3- and α2–6-sialyl linkages was obtained from Dextra Laboratory (Earley Gate, UK). The two purified MSO and commercially obtained DSLNT were treated with NanH1, NanH2 and a recombinant Clostridium perfringens α(2–3)-neuraminidase (New England Biolab). The digestion protocol has been previously reported and deviates only by omitting dialysis to conserve enzymes prior to digestion (30Xie Y. Liu J. Zhang J. Hedrick J.L. Lebrilla C.B. Anal. Chem. 2004; 2004: 5186-5197Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35Zhang J.H. Lindsay L.L. Hedrick J.L. Lebrilla C.B. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 5990-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction consisted of 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer, MSO, and enzyme in a 2:1:1 ratio incubated in a water bath at 37 °C. MALDI FT-ICR MS was used to monitor the digestion reaction every 30 min. The extent of sialylation in the HMO pool was determined using a previously described method that utilizes a porous graphitized carbon nano-LC-MS platform for the separation and identification of milk oligosaccharides (36Niñonuevo M. An H. Yin H. Killeen K. Grimm R. Ward R. German B. Lebrilla C. Electrophoresis. 2005; 26: 3641-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of the fermentation medium was spiked with an equal amount of deuterated growth medium as described in the preceeding sections. Six replicate injections of this sample were performed and the generated chromatograms were analyzed to determine the extent of sialylation in the growth medium as percentages of the total ion current. Mass-spectrometry (MS) was employed to ascertain the preferred MSO compositions, and at what point in the cell cycle B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC15697 utilize these acidic glycans. Briefly, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS (FTICR-MS) was used to monitor fluxes in a mixed population of purified HMOs (i.e. <200 neutral and acidic compositions) subjected to bacterial fermentation. Consumption was represented by the ratio of oligosaccharides recovered from the fermentate to a deuterated internal standard generated from the identical, albeit sterile, starting HMO pool. Discrete mass to charge ratios (m/z) corresponds to a characteristic oligosaccharide degree of polymerization (DP) and monosaccharide composition. The four most abundant MSO compositions were examined comprising ∼1.7% of the total oligosaccharide content of the HMO pool (supplemental Table S2). Sialyllactose was not detected despite applying identical methods that have previously isolated sialyllactose from bovine milk (37Tao N. DePeters E.J. Freeman S. German J.B. Grimm R. Lebrilla C.B. J. Dairy Sci. 2008; 91: 3768-3778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To resolve MSO preferences and exclude spurious degradation, culture supernatants were sampled at various cell physiological stages as defined by culture optical densities (A600 nm) ∼0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 0.75, and 1.0 (Fig. 1). Strikingly, only m/z 999, corresponding to sialyllacto-N-tetraose (SLNT), was consumed in a temporal-dependent manner with a final consumption >50% of the starting material. Three SLNT isomers have been isolated from human milk and are either α2–3/6 sialylated type I HMO or an α2–6 sialylated type II (supplemental Fig. S1). Mono- and di-fucosylayed sialylated lacto-N-hexaose (m/z 1511 and m/z 1657) were not consumed appreciably over the course of fermentation. Repression of SLNT utilization by neutral milk oligosaccharides was not observed, although this cannot be excluded for the other MSO compositions. Furthermore, MSO containing O-acetylated Neu5Ac was not detected in the MSO pool, despite the potential to hydrolyze acetyl ester derivatives encoded by a putative sialate O-acetylesterase gene (Blon_1907). Microbes deploy exo-glycolytic sialidases (EC 3.2.1.18) to utilize terminally sialylated glycans. We have identified two-candidate sialidase sequences encoded within the B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC15697 chromosome, Blon_0646 and Blon_2348 (21Sela D.A. Chapman J. Adeuya A. Kim J.H. Chen F.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18964-18969Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). These predictions were verified, and additional sequences excluded, by scanning the ATCC15697 genome for conserved sialidase motifs. The first sialidase gene, nanH1 (Blon_0646) appears in a gene cluster dedicated to sialic acid catabolism including a N-acetyl neuraminic acid lyase (nanA1), a putative kinase and an epimerase (nanE) (Fig. 2). This encoded pathway provides N-acetyl glucosamine-6-P for further processing by NagA (encoded by Blon_0882; EC 3.2.1.49) and NagB (encoded by Blon_0881; EC 3.5.99.6) into fructose-6-P to enter central metabolism as previously observed in ATCC15697 Neu5Ac metabolism (supplemental Fig. S2 and supplemental Table S3) (21Sela D.A.

https://openalex.org/W2014367743,"Background Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) are blood-feeding insects poised to become one of the major pests in households throughout the United States. Resistance of C. lectularius to insecticides/pesticides is one factor thought to be involved in its sudden resurgence. Despite its high-impact status, scant knowledge exists at the genomic level for C. lectularius. Hence, we subjected the C. lectularius transcriptome to 454 pyrosequencing in order to identify potential genes involved in pesticide resistance. Methodology and Principal Findings Using 454 pyrosequencing, we obtained a total of 216,419 reads with 79,596,412 bp, which were assembled into 35,646 expressed sequence tags (3902 contigs and 31744 singletons). Nearly 85.9% of the C. lectularius sequences showed similarity to insect sequences, but 44.8% of the deduced proteins of C. lectularius did not show similarity with sequences in the GenBank non-redundant database. KEGG analysis revealed putative members of several detoxification pathways involved in pesticide resistance. Lamprin domains, Protein Kinase domains, Protein Tyrosine Kinase domains and cytochrome P450 domains were among the top Pfam domains predicted for the C. lectularius sequences. An initial assessment of putative defense genes, including a cytochrome P450 and a glutathione-S-transferase (GST), revealed high transcript levels for the cytochrome P450 (CYP9) in pesticide-exposed versus pesticide-susceptible C. lectularius populations. A significant number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (296) and microsatellite loci (370) were predicted in the C. lectularius sequences. Furthermore, 59 putative sequences of Wolbachia were retrieved from the database. Conclusions To our knowledge this is the first study to elucidate the genetic makeup of C. lectularius. This pyrosequencing effort provides clues to the identification of potential detoxification genes involved in pesticide resistance of C. lectularius and lays the foundation for future functional genomics studies."
https://openalex.org/W2091506777,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by pronounced fibrotic reaction composed primarily of type I collagen. Although type I collagen functions as a barrier to invasion, pancreatic cancer cells have been shown to respond to type I collagen by becoming more motile and invasive. Because epithelial-mesenchymal transition is also associated with cancer invasion, we examined the extent to which collagen modulated the expression of Snail, a well known regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Relative to cells grown on tissue culture plastic, PDAC cells grown in three-dimensional collagen gels induced Snail. Inhibiting the activity or expression of the TGF-β type I receptor abrogated collagen-induced Snail. Downstream of the receptor, we showed that Smad3 and Smad4 were critical for the induction of Snail by collagen. In contrast, Smad2 or ERK1/2 was not involved in collagen-mediated Snail expression. Overexpression of Snail in PDAC cells resulted in a robust membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14)-dependent invasion through collagen-coated transwell chambers. Snail-expressing PDAC cells also demonstrated MT1-MMP-dependent scattering in three-dimensional collagen gels. Mechanistically, Snail increased the expression of MT1-MMP through activation of ERK-MAPK signaling, and inhibiting ERK signaling in Snail-expressing cells blocked two-dimensional collagen invasion and attenuated scattering in three-dimensional collagen. To provide in vivo support for our findings that Snail can regulate MT1-MMP, we examined the expression of Snail and MT1-MMP in human PDAC tumors and found a statistically significant positive correlation between MT1-MMP and Snail in these tumors. Overall, our data demonstrate that pancreatic cancer cells increase Snail on encountering collagen-rich milieu and suggest that the desmoplastic reaction actively contributes to PDAC progression."
https://openalex.org/W2010943289,"Galectin-8 has much higher affinity for 3'-O-sulfated or 3'-O-sialylated glycoconjugates and a Lewis X-containing glycan than for oligosaccharides terminating in Galβ1→3/4GlcNAc, and this specificity is mainly attributed to the N-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (N-domain, CRD) (Ideo, H., Seko, A., Ishizuka, I., and Yamashita, K. (2003) Glycobiology 13, 713-723). In this study, we elucidated the crystal structures of the human galectin-8-N-domain (-8N) in the absence or presence of 4 ligands. The apo molecule forms a dimer, which is different from the canonical 2-fold symmetric dimer observed for galectin-1 and -2. In a galectin-8N-lactose complex, the lactose-recognizing amino acids are highly conserved among the galectins. However, Arg(45), Gln(47), Arg(59), and the long loop region between the S3 and S4 β-strands are unique to galectin-8N. These amino acids directly or indirectly interact with the sulfate or sialic acid moieties of 3'-sialyl- and 3'-sulfolactose complexed with galectin-8N. Furthermore, in the LNF-III-galectin-8N complex, van der Waals interactions occur between the α1-3-branched fucose and galactose and between galactose and Tyr(141), and these interactions increase the affinity toward galectin-8N. Based on the findings of these x-ray crystallographic analyses, a mutagenesis study using surface plasmon resonance showed that Arg(45), Gln(47), and Arg(59) of galectin-8N are indispensable and coordinately contribute to the strong binding of galectins-8N to sialylated and sulfated oligosaccharides. Arg(59) is the most critical amino acid for binding in the S3-S4 loop region."
https://openalex.org/W2076352550,"Acidic extracellular pH is characteristic of the cell microenvironment in several important physiological and pathological contexts. Although it is well established that acidic extracellular pH can have profound effects on processes such as cell adhesion and migration, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Integrin receptors physically connect cells to the extracellular matrix, and are thus likely to modulate cell responses to extracellular conditions. Here, we examine the role of acidic extracellular pH in regulating activation of integrin α(v)β(3). Through computational molecular dynamics simulations, we find that acidic extracellular pH promotes opening of the α(v)β(3) headpiece, indicating that acidic pH can thereby facilitate integrin activation. This prediction is consistent with our flow cytometry and atomic force microscope-mediated force spectroscopy assays of integrin α(v)β(3) on live cells, which both demonstrate that acidic pH promotes activation at the intact cell surface. Finally, quantification of cell morphology and migration measurements shows that acidic extracellular pH affects cell behavior in a manner that is consistent with increased integrin activation. Taken together, these computational and experimental results suggest a new and complementary mechanism of integrin activation regulation, with associated implications for cell adhesion and migration in regions of altered pH that are relevant to wound healing and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1975481954,"Dishevelled (Dvl) is a key component in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Dvl can multimerize to form dynamic protein aggregates, which are required for the activation of downstream signaling. Upon pathway activation by Wnts, Dvl becomes phosphorylated to yield phosphorylated and shifted (PS) Dvl. Both activation of Dvl in Wnt/β-catenin signaling and Wnt-induced PS-Dvl formation are dependent on casein kinase 1 (CK1) δ/ε activity. However, the overexpression of CK1 was shown to dissolve Dvl aggregates, and endogenous PS-Dvl forms irrespective of whether or not the activating Wnt triggers the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Using a combination of gain-of-function, loss-of-function, and domain mapping approaches, we attempted to solve this discrepancy regarding the role of CK1ε in Dvl biology. We analyzed mutual interaction of CK1δ/ε and two other Dvl kinases, CK2 and PAR1, in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We show that CK2 acts as a constitutive kinase whose activity is required for the further action of CK1ε. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the two consequences of CK1ε phosphorylation are separated both spatially and functionally; first, CK1ε-mediated induction of TCF/LEF-driven transcription (associated with dynamic recruitment of Axin1) is mediated via a PDZ-proline-rich region of Dvl. Second, CK1ε-mediated formation of PS-Dvl is mediated by the Dvl3 C terminus. Furthermore, we demonstrate with several methods that PS-Dvl has decreased ability to polymerize with other Dvls and could, thus, act as the inactive signaling intermediate. We propose a multistep and multikinase model for Dvl activation in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway that uncovers a built-in de-activation mechanism that is triggered by activating phosphorylation of Dvl by CK1δ/ε."
https://openalex.org/W2136995156,"Wnt pathways play essential roles in cell proliferation, morphogenesis, and cell fate specification during embryonic development. According to the consensus view, the Wnt pathway prevents the degradation of the key signaling component β-catenin by the protein complex containing the negative regulators Axin and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Stabilized β-catenin associates with TCF proteins and enters the nucleus to promote target gene expression. This study examines the involvement of HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2) in the regulation of different TCF proteins in Xenopus embryos in vivo. We show that the TCF family members LEF1, TCF4, and TCF3 are phosphorylated in embryonic ectoderm after Wnt8 stimulation and HIPK2 overexpression. We also find that TCF3 phosphorylation is triggered by canonical Wnt ligands, LRP6, and dominant negative mutants for Axin and GSK3, indicating that this process shares the same upstream regulators with β-catenin stabilization. HIPK2-dependent phosphorylation caused the dissociation of LEF1, TCF4, and TCF3 from a target promoter in vivo. This result provides a mechanistic explanation for the context-dependent function of HIPK2 in Wnt signaling; HIPK2 up-regulates transcription by phosphorylating TCF3, a transcriptional repressor, but inhibits transcription by phosphorylating LEF1, a transcriptional activator. Finally, we show that upon HIPK2-mediated phosphorylation, TCF3 is replaced with positively acting TCF1 at a target promoter. These observations emphasize a critical role for Wnt/HIPK2-dependent TCF phosphorylation and suggest that TCF switching is an important mechanism of Wnt target gene activation in vertebrate embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2069348681,"A key finding in studies of the neurobiology of learning memory is that the amygdala is critically involved in Pavlovian fear conditioning. This is well established in delay-cued and contextual fear conditioning; however, surprisingly little is known of the role of the amygdala in trace conditioning. Trace fear conditioning, in which the CS and US are separated in time by a trace interval, requires the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. It is possible that recruitment of cortical structures by trace conditioning alters the role of the amygdala compared to delay fear conditioning, where the CS and US overlap. To investigate this, we inactivated the amygdala of male C57BL/6 mice with GABA (A) agonist muscimol prior to 2-pairing trace or delay fear conditioning. Amygdala inactivation produced deficits in contextual and delay conditioning, but had no effect on trace conditioning. As controls, we demonstrate that dorsal hippocampal inactivation produced deficits in trace and contextual, but not delay fear conditioning. Further, pre- and post-training amygdala inactivation disrupted the contextual but the not cued component of trace conditioning, as did muscimol infusion prior to 1- or 4-pairing trace conditioning. These findings demonstrate that insertion of a temporal gap between the CS and US can generate amygdala-independent fear conditioning. We discuss the implications of this surprising finding for current models of the neural circuitry involved in fear conditioning."

We investigated relations of serum levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 to mortality risk from an etiological perspective.The prospective Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) cohort, followed from 1991-1995 for up to 18.1 years. A random population-based sample of 1,082 71-year-old men, no loss to follow-up. Endpoints were all-cause (n = 628), cardiovascular (n = 230), non-cardiovascular (n = 398) and cancer mortality (n = 178), and fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction (n = 138) or stroke (n = 163).Serum MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were associated with risk of all-cause mortality (Cox proportional hazard ratio [HR] per standard deviation 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.19; and 1.11, 1.02-1.20; respectively). TIMP-1 levels were mainly related to risks of cardiovascular mortality and stroke (HR per standard deviation 1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.37; and 1.18, 1.04-1.35; respectively). All relations except those of TIMP-1 to stroke risk were attenuated by adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors. Relations in a subsample without cardiovascular disease or cancer were similar to those in the total sample.In this community-based cohort of elderly men, serum MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were related to mortality risk. An altered extracellular matrix metabolism may be involved in several detrimental pathways, and circulating MMP-9 or TIMP-1 levels may be relevant markers thereof."

The dynamic of this production and more globally the metabolism of this species is still poorly known. A DNA microarray based on the genome of M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 was constructed and used to study the dynamics of gene expression in this cyanobacterium during the light/dark cycle, because light is a critical factor for this species, like for other photosynthetic microorganisms. This first application of transcriptomics to a Microcystis species has revealed that more than 25% of the genes displayed significant changes in their transcript abundance during the light/dark cycle and in particular during the dark/light transition. The metabolism of M. aeruginosa is compartmentalized between the light period, during which carbon uptake, photosynthesis and the reductive pentose phosphate pathway lead to the synthesis of glycogen, and the dark period, during which glycogen degradation, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, the TCA branched pathway and ammonium uptake promote amino acid biosynthesis. We also show that the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, such as microcystins, aeruginosin and cyanopeptolin, occur essentially during the light period, suggesting that these metabolites may interact with the diurnal part of the central metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2072551243,"Corin is a cardiac membrane protease that activates natriuretic peptides. It is unknown how corin function is regulated. Recently, soluble corin was detected in human plasma, suggesting that corin may be shed from cardiomyocytes. Here we examined soluble corin production and activity and determined the proteolytic enzymes responsible for corin cleavage. We expressed human corin in HEK 293 cells and detected three soluble fragments of ∼180, ∼160, and ∼100 kDa, respectively, in the cultured medium by Western blot analysis. All three fragments were derived from activated corin molecules. Similar results were obtained in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Using protease inhibitors, ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate stimulation, small interfering RNA knockdown, and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that ADAM10 was primarily responsible for shedding corin in its juxtamembrane region to release the ∼180-kDa fragment, corresponding to the near-entire extracellular region. In contrast, the ∼160- and ∼100-kDa fragments were from corin autocleavage at Arg-164 in frizzled 1 domain and Arg-427 in LDL receptor 5 domain, respectively. In functional studies, the ∼180-kDa fragment activated atrial natriuretic peptide, whereas the ∼160- and ∼100-kDa fragments did not. Our data indicate that ADAM-mediated shedding and corin autocleavage are important mechanisms regulating corin function and preventing excessive, potentially hazardous, proteolytic activities in the heart."

https://openalex.org/W2082727082,"The pathogenicity of staphylococcus aureus is dependent largely upon its ability to secrete a number of virulence factors, therefore, anti-virulence strategy to combat S. aureus-mediated infections is now gaining great interest. It is widely recognized that some plant essential oils could affect the production of staphylococcal exotoxins when used at subinhibitory concentrations. Perilla [Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton], a natural medicine found in eastern Asia, is primarily used as both a medicinal and culinary herb. Its essential oil (perilla oil) has been previously demonstrated to be active against S. aureus. However, there are no data on the influence of perilla oil on the production of S. aureus exotoxins.A broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of perilla oil against S. aureus strains. Hemolysis, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) release, Western blot, and real-time RT-PCR assays were performed to evaluate the effects of subinhibitory concentrations of perilla oil on exotoxins production in S. aureus. The data presented here show that perilla oil dose-dependently decreased the production of α-toxin, enterotoxins A and B (the major staphylococcal enterotoxins), and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) in both methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).The production of α-toxin, SEA, SEB, and TSST-1 in S. aureus was decreased by perilla oil. These data suggest that perilla oil may be useful for the treatment of S. aureus infections when used in combination with β-lactam antibiotics, which can increase exotoxins production by S. aureus at subinhibitory concentrations. Furthermore, perilla oil could be rationally applied in food systems as a novel food preservative both to inhibit the growth of S. aureus and to repress the production of exotoxins, particularly staphylococcal enterotoxins."

Reports suggest the D-domain or hinge region of ERα plays an important role in mechanisms 1 and 2 above. Studies demonstrating the functionality of the ERα hinge region have resected the full D-domain; therefore, site directed mutations were made to attribute precise sequence functionality to this domain. This study focuses on the characterization and properties of three novel site directed ERα- D-domain mutants. The Hinge 1 (H1) ERα mutant has disrupted nuclear localization, can no longer perform tethered mediated responses and has lost interaction with c-Jun, but retains estrogen response element (ERE)-mediated functions as demonstrated by confocal microscopy, reporter assays, endogenous gene expression and co-immunoprecipitation. The H2 ERα mutant is non-nuclear, but translocates to the nucleus with estradiol (E2) treatment and maintains ERE-mediated functionality. The H2+NES ERα mutant does not maintain nuclear translocation with hormone binding, no longer activates ERE-target genes, functions in ERE- or tethered-mediated luciferase assays, but does retain the non-genomic, non-nuclear, rapid action response. These studies reveal the sequence(s) in the ERα hinge region that are involved in tethered-mediated actions as well as nuclear localization and attribute important functionality to this region of the receptor. In addition, the properties of these ERα mutants will allow future studies to further dissect and characterize the three main ERα mechanisms of action and determine the mechanistic role each action has in estrogen hormone regulation. The three main mechanisms of ERα action are: 1) nuclear, genomic, direct DNA binding, 2) nuclear, genomic, “tethered”-mediated, protein-protein interactions, and 3) non-nuclear, non-genomic, rapid action responses. Reports suggest the D-domain or hinge region of ERα plays an important role in mechanisms 1 and 2 above. Studies demonstrating the functionality of the ERα hinge region have resected the full D-domain; therefore, site directed mutations were made to attribute precise sequence functionality to this domain. This study focuses on the characterization and properties of three novel site directed ERα- D-domain mutants. The Hinge 1 (H1) ERα mutant has disrupted nuclear localization, can no longer perform tethered mediated responses and has lost interaction with c-Jun, but retains estrogen response element (ERE)-mediated functions as demonstrated by confocal microscopy, reporter assays, endogenous gene expression and co-immunoprecipitation.

In addition, the properties of these ERα mutants will allow future studies to further dissect and characterize the three main ERα mechanisms of action and determine the mechanistic role each action has in estrogen hormone regulation. Many of the biological effects of estrogen are mediated through the estrogen receptors (ERs), 2The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; E2, 17β-estradiol; ERE, estrogen response element; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export signal. ERα and ERβ, which belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M.

Focusing on ligand-dependent activation, to date, there are three main mechanisms of action for ERα that include 1) nuclear, genomic, direct DNA binding, 2) nuclear, genomic, “tethered”-mediated protein-protein interactions, and 3) non-nuclear, non-genomic, rapid action responses (2Hewitt S.C.

Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1672-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanism 1 involves liganded ERα bound to estrogen response elements (EREs) of target genes to mediate changes in gene expression via the “classical” ERα DNA binding responses (4McDevitt M.A. Glidewell-Kenney C.

Endocrine Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). The 2nd mechanism involves the recruitment and interaction of ERα which “tethers” to other transcription factors, such as c-Jun and Sp1, forming a protein-protein complex that interacts directly with the AP-1 and Sp1 DNA response elements, respectively (7Kushner P.J.

Vitamins Hormones. 2001; 62: 231-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lastly, the 3rd mechanism, involves a small population of non-nuclear ERα that mediates rapid signaling events which include cellular calcium mobilization, nitric oxide synthesis, and activation of intracellular signaling cascades such as those involving MAPK/ERK, Src, or Akt (5Madak-Erdogan Z.

Endocrine Rev. 2007; 28: 726-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). ERα, as with all nuclear receptors, maintains the classical domain demarcations. Each domain can act independently, but for full functionality, proper spatial orientation is necessary for transactivation of target genes (8Webb P. Nguyen P. Valentine C. Lopez G.N. Kwok G.R.

Steroids. 1999; 64: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The A/B domain of ERα harbors the hormone-independent activation function domain (AF-1), the C-domain holds the DNA binding domain (DBD), the D-domain or hinge region contain putative nuclear localization sequences (NLS), and the E/F domain harbors the ligand binding domain (LBD) and the hormone-dependent activation function (AF-2) (15Kumar R.

The D-domain originally viewed as a flexible linker between the DBD and the LBD, is demonstrating to be critical for proper control of nuclear receptor activity (17Tanner T.M. Denayer S. Geverts B.

The classical ERα-mediated DNA binding responses are well established and are abrogated by specific disruption of two amino acid substitutions (E207A/G208A) in the DNA binding domain (10Jakacka M.

This ERα mutant only performs tethered and rapid action responses, as demonstrated by in vivo microarray of the mouse uterus showing that the tethered response accounts for ∼25% of the WT transcripts (3Hewitt S.C.

The functions of classical and rapid action-mediated ERα responses apart from the tethered-mediated ERα responses are not defined. Rapid action, non-nuclear ERα responses are attributed to the same ERα as the genomic responses (4McDevitt M.A. Glidewell-Kenney C. Jimenez M.A. Ahearn P.C. Weiss J. Jameson J.L. Levine J.E. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar); however, it is challenging to separate the genomic ERα responses from the non-genomic ERα responses. Non-nuclear mechanisms are thought to involve activation of membrane-initiated kinase cascades. ERα does not have a transmembrane domain, but ERα interacts with caveolin-1 (6Song R.X. Zhang Z. Santen R.J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 16: 347-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and contains a palmitoylation sequence (28Acconcia F. Ascenzi P. Bocedi A. Spisni E. Tomasi V. Trentalance A. Visca P. Marino M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), which allows ERα to localize to the membrane. Rapid estrogen signaling via membrane-associated ERα leads to (a) MAPK, Akt, p21Ras, Raf, and PKC activation, (b) alterations of potassium channels, (c) increase in intracellular Ca+2 levels, and (d) release of nitric oxide and stimulation of prolactin secretion in various cell and tissue types (6Song R.X.

Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The estrogen dendrimer complexes (EDCs) activate p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2), Shc, and Src and are ineffective in stimulating endogenous estradiol target genes (30Harrington W.R. Kim S.H. Funk C.C. Madak-Erdogan Z. Schiff R. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Rapid action data obtained from the EDCs allow for ERα signaling from the membrane but, this method does not define non-nuclear actions alone as endogenous ERα is present and able to mediate genomic actions (5Madak-Erdogan Z. Kieser K.J. Kim S.H. Komm B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 2116-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Previously, studies that have examined the hinge region of ERα have completely deleted the D-domain, rendering the receptor without the functionality of this domain (14Ylikomi T. Bocquel M.T. Berry M. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3681-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 31Rai D. Frolova A. Frasor J. Carpenter A.E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol.

These studies attributed to the understanding of the functionality of the D-domain of ERα, but the exact sequences in the hinge region of ERα critical for nuclear localization and interaction with c-Jun are not identified. Functionality of cytoplasmic/membrane only ERα or functionality of ERα apart from tethered-mediated activity have not been described. Therefore, with previous literature suggesting that the D-domain is involved in these functions of ERα, we sought to create specific ERα mutants to define these actions. Mutations in the hinge region of ERα were generated by site directed mutagenesis rather than deletion mutations. Hinge mutants H1 ERα, H2 ERα, and H2+NES ERα have unique properties that block ERα tethered-mediated effects, block nuclear localization without ligand, and block liganded nuclear genomic-mediated actions while maintaining non-nuclear, rapid action responses, respectively. These ERα mutants define sequence(s) in the ERα D-domain responsible for actions involving nuclear localization and gene selective activation and demonstrate that the D-domain of ERα is critical for not only receptor nuclear localization but also in selective transcriptional regulation. 17β-Estradiol (E2) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and ICI 182,780 was from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO).

A 306-bp fragment created from a 156-bp forward primer and a 200-bp reverse primer introducing R267A, K270A, K272A, K273A, and K275A mutations was subcloned and ligated back into pcDNA/mERα via directional cloning into the BsmI and XbaI sites. The pcDNA/Hinge 2 (H2)-mERα mutant was also generated using a 306-bp fragment created from a 156-bp forward primer and a 199-bp reverse primer introducing R260A, K261A, R263A, R264A, R267A, K270A, K272A, R273A, and R275A mutations was sublconed and ligated back into pcDNA/mERα via directional cloning into the Bsm1 and XbaI sites. The pcDNA/H2+NES-mERα mutant was generated from pcDNA/H2-mERα to introduce the nuclear export signal (NES) by using QuikChange Lightning (Stratagene) to introduce R273L and D274L thus creating the sequence shown in Fig. 1A. The pcDNA/NES-mERα was generated from pcDNA/mERα by using QuikChange Lightning to introduce R273L and D274L. To tag the ERα mutants with GFP for cellular localization analysis, each ERα construct was subcloned from the pcDNA3/vector into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). pcDNA/mERα was opened with SphI and blunted with Klenow (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and then cut with EcoRI. The mERα and mERα-mutants were ligated into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of pEGFP-C1. Human kidney cell line 293F was purchased from Invitrogen, and human cervical epithelial cell line HeLa and human kidney cell line HEK293T/17 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Ishikawa, human uterine epithelial cells, have been described previously (35Mueller S.O. Hall J.M. Swope D.L. Pedersen L.C. Korach K.S. The J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12255-12262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 293F were maintained in phenol-red free DMEM (Gibco- Invitrogen, #21063) supplemented with 10% FBS (BenchMark, Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA), and HeLa Ishikawa cells were maintained in phenol-red free DMEM:F12 (Gibco- Invitrogen, #11039) supplemented with 10% FBS. All lentivirus was packaged in HEK293T/17 cells according to published protocols (36Salmon P. Trono D. Current Protocols in Neuroscience. 2006; 37: 4.21.1-4.21.24Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transiently transfected with pMD2G, psPAX2, and pDEST673 carrying the neomycin resistance gene and the desired ERα mutant using Lipofectamine 2000. Supernatant was collected 48 h post transfection and concentrated by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 2 h. Pellets were resuspended in PBS and used for infection. Titers were determined using quantitative PCR to measure the number of lentiviral particles integrated into the host genome. MOI ranging from ∼180 to 25 were used for infection of Ishikawa cells. After 3 days of infection, cells selected with Geneticin (1.2 mg/ml, Invitrogen, #11811-031) and a stably pooled population of cells was obtained after 2 weeks. Stable integration of ERα was verified by Western blot for ERα. Cells were seeded in 24 well plates overnight. A total of 0.5 μg of DNA, including 0.2 μg of expression plasmids (pcDNA/vector, pcDNA/ERα, pcDNA/H1-ERα, pcDNA/H2+NES-ERα, or pcDNA/NES-ERα) 0.2 μg of reporter plasmids (3xERE Luc or AP-1 Luc) and 0.1 μg of pRLTK plasmids, were transfected overnight using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were starved with 10% HyClone Charcoal/Dextran-stripped FBS (sFBS) (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 8 h and then were treated as described in the figure legends. For luciferase experiments co-expressing c-Jun, cells were plated and transfected as above with a total of 0.5 μg of DNA, including 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of ERα expression plasmids and/or 0.1 μg of pRSV/c-Jun and 0.1 μg of pRLTK. For experiments co-expressing SRC-2, cells were plated and transfected as above with a total of 0.75 μg of DNA, including 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of ERα expression plasmid, 0.4 μg of pcDNA3/SRC-2, and 0.05 μg of pRLTK. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Activity System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Data are from three independent experiments. HeLa cells were grown overnight on Lab-Tek 2 well chamber slides (NUNC, Rochester, NY), transfected with 0.5 μg of pEGFP-ERα expression plasmids as described above. Cells were starved with 10% sFBS for 8 h and then were treated as described in the figures and figure legends. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS and coverslipped with ProLong Gold Anti-Fade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen, #P-36931). The cellular localization of ERα was visualized by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM-510 equipped with an argon-krypton laser) using a 40 × 1.2 objective lens. For the Western blot, whole cell lysates were obtained from cells transiently transfected with ERα expression plasmids using RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and 10 μg of whole cell lysate was run on a 10% Tris-glycine gel, transferred to nitrocellulose and the ERα was detected by anti-ERα (MC-20) and GAPDH by anti-GAPDH using the ECL Plus Detection System (Amersham BiosciencesTM, GE Healthcare Biosciences, Corp., Piscataway, NJ). 293F cells were plated in 10-cm dishes overnight. Cells were transfected overnight as above with 2 μg of pcDNA/ERα plasmid (WT and H1 mutant) and/or 3 μg of pRSV/c-Jun. Cells were treated for 36 h with vehicle or 10 nm E2. Cell lysates were prepared in 400 μl of RIPA buffer. HIP buffer ((50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture) was added to the cell lysate to a final volume of 4 ml. The cell lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amerham, CL-4B, 17-0780-01) for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. Protein lysates (1 ml) were immunoprecipitated by using 5 μg of anti-ERα (H-184), anti-c-Jun, rabbit IgG, and mouse IgG overnight at 4 °C with rocking. The protein antibody complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose, suspended in the lysis buffer, for 4 h at 4 °C with rocking. The bound complexes were washed 6 times with HIP buffer, precipitated, and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were then resolved with the 10% Tris-glycine gel system. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and the presence of ERα or c-Jun in the precipitants was detected by anti-ERα (MC-20) or c-Jun. The immunoreactive products were detected by the ECL Plus Detection System. Total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using superscript reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The mRNA levels of progesterone receptor (PR), pS2, and p21 were measured using SYBR green assays (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of primers used in real-time PCR were as follows: for human PR (NM_000926.4): the forward primer 5′-GACGTGGAGGGCGCATAT-3′, reverse primer 5′-GCAGTCCGCTGTCCTTTTCT-3′, for human pS2 (NM_003225.2): the forward primer 5′-GCCCTCCCAGTCTGCAAATA-3′, reverse primer 5′-CTGGAGGGACGTCGATGGTA-3′, for human p21 (NM_078467.1): the forward primer 5′-CCTGTCACTGTCTTGTACCCT-3′, reverse primer 5′-GCGTTTGGAGTGGTAGAAATCT-3′. Cycle time values were obtained using the ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System and analysis software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each sample was quantified against its β-actin transcript content: the forward primer 5′-GACAGGATGCAGAAGGAGATCAC-3′, reverse primer 5′-GCTTCATACTCCAGCAGG-3′, or its GAPDH transcript content: the forward primer 5′-ATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTCG-3′, reverse primer 5′-GGGGTCATTGATGGCAACAATA-3′ and then normalized with respect to the control group. Quantification was performed according to the mathematical model described by Pfaffl (37Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25871) Google Scholar) and as previously described (33Winuthayanon W. Piyachaturawat P. Suksamrarn A. Ponglikitmongkol M. Arao Y. Hewitt S.C.

The experiments were repeated three times and results are presented as fold increase + S.D. Cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes, cultured overnight in phenol red-free DMEM:F12 medium with 10% FBS, and transfected with 2 μg of ERα expression plasmids as indicated in the figure legends for 8 h following the Effectene manufacturer's protocol. The transfected cells were then starved in phenol red-free DMEM:F12 with 0.1% sFBS for 3 days. Ishikawa stable cell lines were seeded and starved as above. Cells were treated with 100 nm E2 for 0, 3, 5, 10 min. Cells were placed on ice, washed with cold PBS, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Igepal (Sigma #56741), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1× complete mini-tab (Roche 11-836-170-001), 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), for 30 min followed by sonication with a probe sonicator for 15 s on ice (setting 6 on 60 Sonic Dismembrator from Fisher Scientific). The supernatant (2 μg) was used for Western blot analysis as described above. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-test was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test was also performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.00. The D-domain of ERα is important for nuclear localization and interaction via the tethered mechanism (10Jakacka M. Ito M. Weiss J. Chien P.Y. Gehm B.D. Jameson J.L. J. Biol.

Computational analysis of ERα by LOCtree and Motif Scan suggested putative nuclear localization signals in the C-domain and D-domain (amino acids 234–240 and 270–275; amino acids 247–263 and 260–276, respectively). Amino acids 234–240 are located in the C-domain/DNA binding domain of ERα. Amino acids 257–276 are located in the D-domain/hinge region and analysis of the suggested nuclear localization signals in the hinge region, revealed two putative bipartite nuclear localization sequences (NLS—K-(K/R)-X-(K/R)). The putative nuclear localization sequences are 100% conserved between mouse and human ERα (Fig. 1A), and in addition, this area is not conserved between ERα and ERβ as seen with alignment analysis. To further characterize the hinge region and to precisely define the sequences involved in ERα nuclear localization and ERα tethered-mediated responses, site-directed mutagenesis was performed in this area of the hinge region of ERα at the sites shown in Fig. 1B. Confocal microscopy was used to demonstrate ERα localization by visualizing enhanced GFP-tagged ERα and mutant ERα proteins in transiently transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). WT ERα is predominately nuclear in the absence or presence of ligand, E2. Examination of the H1 mutant, where part of the bipartite NLS is mutated to alanine, demonstrated a disruption of nuclear localization in the absence of ligand; however, in the presence of E2, this mutant translocated to the nucleus. The H2 ERα mutant, having the full bipartite NLS mutated to alanine, is non-nuclear in the absence of ligand, but in the presence of E2, translocation to the nucleus is observed. To force exclusion of the ERα from the nucleus the NES ERα mutant was engineered to have a nuclear export signal (NES—LXXXLXXLXL (38la Cour T. Kiemer L. Mølgaard A. Gupta R. Skriver K. Brunak S. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar)) in the same area of the hinge region as the putative NLS. The NES ERα mutant translocates to the nucleus in the absence and presence of ligand as is seen"
https://openalex.org/W2095229835,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptors with essential functions in lipid, glucose and energy homeostasis, cell differentiation, inflammation and metabolic disorders, and represent important drug targets. PPARs heterodimerize with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and can form transcriptional activator or repressor complexes at specific DNA elements (PPREs). It is believed that the decision between repression and activation is generally governed by a ligand-mediated switch. We have performed genomewide analyses of agonist-treated and PPARβ/δ-depleted human myofibroblasts to test this hypothesis and to identify global principles of PPARβ/δ-mediated gene regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) of PPARβ/δ, H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II enrichment sites combined with transcriptional profiling enabled the definition of 112 bona fide PPARβ/δ target genes showing either of three distinct types of transcriptional response: (I) ligand-independent repression by PPARβ/δ; (II) ligand-induced activation and/or derepression by PPARβ/δ; and (III) ligand-independent activation by PPARβ/δ. These data identify PPRE-mediated repression as a major mechanism of transcriptional regulation by PPARβ/δ, but, unexpectedly, also show that only a subset of repressed genes are activated by a ligand-mediated switch. Our results also suggest that the type of transcriptional response by a given target gene is connected to the structure of its associated PPRE(s) and the biological function of its encoded protein. These observations have important implications for understanding the regulatory PPAR network and PPARβ/δ ligand-based drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1995926508,"CD40 is a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family protein that plays an important role in B cell development. CD154/CD40L is the physiological ligand of CD40. We have determined the crystal structure of the CD40-CD154 complex at 3.5 Å resolution. The binding site of CD40 is located in a crevice formed between two CD154 subunits. Charge complementarity plays a critical role in the CD40-CD154 interaction. Some of the missense mutations found in hereditary hyper-IgM syndrome can be mapped to the CD40-CD154 interface. The CD40 interaction area of one of the CD154 subunits is twice as large as that of the other subunit forming the binding crevice. This is because cysteine-rich domain 3 (CRD3) of CD40 has a disulfide bridge in an unusual position that alters the direction of the ladder-like structure of CD40. The Ser(132) loop of CD154 is not involved in CD40 binding but its substitution significantly reduces p38- and ERK-dependent signaling by CD40, whereas JNK-dependent signaling is not affected. These findings suggest that ligand-induced di- or trimerization is necessary but not sufficient for complete activation of CD40."
https://openalex.org/W2134420941,"The MSH3 gene is one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes that has undergone somatic mutation frequently in MMR-deficient cancers. MSH3, together with MSH2, forms the MutSβ heteroduplex, which interacts with interstrand cross-links (ICLs) induced by drugs such as cisplatin and psoralen. However, the precise role of MSH3 in mediating the cytotoxic effects of ICL-inducing agents remains poorly understood. In this study, we first examined the effects of MSH3 deficiency on cytotoxicity caused by cisplatin and oxaliplatin, another ICL-inducing platinum drug. Using isogenic HCT116-derived clones in which MSH3 expression is controlled by shRNA expression in a Tet-off system, we discovered that MSH3 deficiency sensitized cells to both cisplatin and oxaliplatin at clinically relevant doses. Interestingly, siRNA-induced down-regulation of the MLH1 protein did not affect MSH3-dependent toxicity of these drugs, indicating that this process does not require participation of the canonical MMR pathway. Furthermore, MSH3-deficient cells maintained higher levels of phosphorylated histone H2AX and 53BP1 after oxaliplatin treatment in comparison with MSH3-proficient cells, suggesting that MSH3 plays an important role in repairing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). This role of MSH3 was further supported by our findings that MSH3-deficient cells were sensitive to olaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor. Moreover, the combination of oxaliplatin and olaparib exhibited a synergistic effect compared with either treatment individually. Collectively, our results provide novel evidence that MSH3 deficiency contributes to the cytotoxicity of platinum drugs through deficient DSB repair.

MutSα, an MSH2/MSH6 heterodimer, recognizes single base mismatches, whereas MutSβ, an MSH2/MSH3 heterodimer, primarily recognizes 2–4-bp insertion-deletion loops (1Kunkel T.A. Erie D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 681-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 2Jiricny J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The MutL complex, mainly MutLα, an MLH1/PMS2 heterodimer, forms a ternary complex with a MutS heterodimer that binds to DNA mismatches during replication and leads to recruitment of other proteins to complete the process of DNA MMR. Germ line mutations in MMR genes result in Lynch syndrome, which is characterized by hereditary predisposition to cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI) in the colon, endometrium, ovaries, and urinary tract (3Hendriks Y.M. de Jong A.E.

In contrast, MMR deficiency resulting from MLH1 promoter methylation causes sporadic MSI tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC) (∼15%), endometrial cancer (20–25%), and ovarian cancer (∼12%) (4Boland C.R.

The MMR system also participates in repairing certain DNA adducts generated by DNA damaging agents such as alkylating agents and 6-thioguanine. The primary cytotoxic lesion generated by alkylating agents is O6-methylguanine (MeG), which causes MeG -T mispairs (7Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 6443-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). MutSα recognizes these mispairs and recruits MutLα for the subsequent repair reactions (8de Wind N. Dekker M. Claij N. Jansen L. van Klink Y. Radman M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Loss of MutSα or MutLα renders a cell tolerant to the cytotoxic effects of these drugs, suggesting that these two complexes are also linked to a signal transduction pathway that leads to cell growth arrest or cell death (10Koi M. Umar A. Chauhan D.P. Cherian S.P. Carethers J.M. Kunkel T.A. Boland C.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4308-4312PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hawn M.T. Umar A. Carethers J.M. Marra G. Kunkel T.A. Boland C.R. Koi M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3721-3725PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, MutSβ recognizes interstrand cross-links (ICLs) generated by DNA cross-linkers such as psoralen and cisplatin. MutSβ is involved in the recognition and uncoupling of the psoralen-induced ICLs in mammalian cell extracts (12Zhang N. Lu X. Zhang X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2388-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that MutSβ interacts with Xeroderma pigmentosum group A-Replication Protein A or Xeroderma pigmentosum group C-RAD23B, both of which are involved in nucleotide excision repair, in the recognition of psoralen ICLs and promotes the nucleotide excision repair process (13Zhao J. Jain A. Iyer R.R. Modrich P.L. Vasquez K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4420-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Vasquez K.M. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2010; 51: 527-539PubMed Google Scholar). The level of homologous recombination (HR) that repairs ICLs is also dependent on MutSβ but not on MutSα or MLH1. These results suggest that MutSβ may cooperate with the nucleotide excision repair, HR and Fanconi anemia proteins for repairing psoralen-induced ICLs (15Zhang N. Liu X. Li L. Legerski R. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 1670-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, MutSβ also binds to cisplatin-induced ICLs together with PARP-1, DNA ligase III, XRCC-1, Ku80, and Ku70, suggesting that MutSβ may also cooperate with other repair pathways to recognize and repair platinum drug-induced ICLs (16Zhu G. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4916-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Oxaliplatin, a third generation platinum drug, is one of the key drugs that is currently being used for the treatment of CRC patients. Similar to cisplatin, oxaliplatin also forms intrastrand cross-links and ICLs (17Chaney S.G. Campbell S.L. Bassett E. Wu Y. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2005; 53: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in repair and the cytotoxic effects of oxaliplatin-induced adducts, especially ICLs, have not been explored extensively. Considering that the MutSβ complex plays a role in repairing ICLs, we hypothesized that MSH3 deficiency may halt the repair of ICLs induced by platinum drugs, resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity of these drugs in cancer patients. Additionally, because MSH3 deficiency results in suppressed HR (15Zhang N. Liu X. Li L. Legerski R. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 1670-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and HR-defective cells are hypersensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (18Bryant H.E. Schultz N.

Nature. 2005; 434: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (4441) Google Scholar), we further hypothesized that MSH3 deficiency may also result in sensitization of cells to PARP inhibitors. In MSI CRC, frequent frameshift mutations (20–50%) within the mononucleotide A8 repeats in exon 7 of MSH3 results in loss or reduction of MSH3 (20Plaschke J. Krüger S. Jeske B. Theissig F. Kreuz F.R.

Recently, we found that MSH3-negative cancer cell population exists within sporadic CRC tissues that exhibit low levels of MSI and/or elevated microsatellite alterations at tetranucleotide repeats (EMAST) (23Haugen A.C. Goel A. Yamada K. Marra G. Nguyen T.P. Nagasaka T. Kanazawa S. Koike J. Kikuchi Y. Zhong X. Arita M. Shibuya K. Oshimura M. Hemmi H. Boland C.R. Koi M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8465-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Intuitively, if MSH3 deficiency dictates the toxicity of platinum drugs and PARP inhibitors in a clinical setting, MSH3 status can be used as a predictive marker for the chemotherapeutic outcome in patients with MSH3-deficient cancers. To explore this possibility, using isogenic cell lines in which MSH3 protein expression can be regulated thorough shRNA expression in a Tet-off system, we investigated the effect of MSH3 deficiency on the cellular sensitivity to two platinum drugs and a well known PARP inhibitor. Herein, we provide novel molecular evidence that MSH3 deficiency in CRC cell lines contributes toward the cytotoxicity of platinum drugs, especially as a result of compromised double strand break (DSB) repair. Cisplatin, oxaliplatin, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, and propidium iodide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX). The human colon cancer cell lines HCT116, HCT116+ch.3 (HCT116+3), HCT116+ch.3+ch.5 (HCT116+3+5) have been described previously (10Koi M. Umar A. Chauhan D.P. Cherian S.P. Carethers J.M. Kunkel T.A.

HCT116+3+5 cells were stably transfected with a tetracycline-regulated retroviral vector, the TMP (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) that encodes shRNA against MSH3. Stable MSH3-deficient clones G1, G2, and G5 were isolated (see “Results” and Ref. 23Haugen A.C. Goel A. Yamada K. Marra G. Nguyen T.P. Nagasaka T. Kanazawa S. Koike J. Kikuchi Y. Zhong X. Arita M.

HCT116, HCT116+3, and HCT116+3+5 cells were grown in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. The G1, G2, and G5 cells were maintained in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.6 μg/ml of puromycin. To turn off the expression of MSH3 shRNA, 1 μg/ml of doxycycline was added to the culture medium. Proteins from cell lysates were prepared, separated on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes as described previously (23Haugen A.C. Goel A. Yamada K. Marra G. Nguyen T.P. Nagasaka T. Kanazawa S. Koike J. Kikuchi Y. Zhong X. Arita M. Shibuya K. Oshimura M. Hemmi H. Boland C.R. Koi M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8465-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Anti-human MSH3 mouse monoclonal antibody (dilution: 1:250, clone 52, BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), anti-human MLH1 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:200, G168–728, BD Pharmingen) and anti-β-actin antibody (1:10,000, clone AC-15, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as primary antibodies for the detection of specific proteins. Goat anti-mouse antibody (1:3000, catalog no. sc-2005, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used as a secondary antibody. The signal amplification and detection was achieved by exposing the membrane to ECL reagent (GE Healthcare), followed by visualization on the Storm imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Two hundred cells were seeded in each well of a six-well plate. For the measurement of the cytotoxicity caused by cisplatin or oxaliplatin, the cells were treated with the drugs for 24 h once the cells were attached to the plate. For the measurement of the cytotoxicity caused by olaparib, cells were treated continuously with the drug during the experiments. After 8–10 days, the number of colonies (colonies with >50 cells) were counted, and the relative change in clonogenic survival of drug-treated versus untreated cells was determined. One million cells were seeded in 10-cm plates. Once attached, the cells lines were treated with oxaliplatin for 24 h. After an additional 48 h, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and fixed in cold 70% ethanol at −20 °C overnight or for several days. The ethanol-fixed cells (2 × 106) were subsequently washed with PBS twice and incubated with 300 μl of PBS and 0.15% RNase A for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were stained with 75 μg/ml propidium iodide for 30 min and then analyzed for DNA content using a FACSCantoII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle data were analyzed by Flowjo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). The proliferation index was measured by BrdU incorporation in HCT116+3+5 and G5 cells, 48 h after the initial 24-h treatment with oxaliplatin (Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdU, Roche Diagnostics). Experiments were performed in triplicate, and data were obtained from three or four independent experiments. MLH1 siRNA, MSH3 siRNA, and nontargeted siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Two hundred thousand cells were seeded in 24-well plates. After an overnight incubation, the cells were transfected with 83 nm of the targeted siRNAs or nontargeted siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested and replated for clonogenic survival assays. Ten thousand cells were grown on glass coverslips in a 12-well plate. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.5) in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then blocked with 10% goat serum (Invitrogen) for 1 h. The cells were subsequently incubated with an anti-active caspase-3 antibody (1:500, G748, Promega, Madison, WI), an anti-phosphorylated histone H2AX (pH2AX) antibody (1:5000, JBW301, Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA), or an anti-53BP1 antibody (1:600, ab21083, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for 1 h, followed by a secondary antibody (1:800, Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody, Invitrogen) for 40 min. Prolong Gold with DAPI (Invitrogen) was used in the mounting medium. The images were obtained using AxioSkop2 multichannel epifluorescence microscope equipped with AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). We first determined whether MSH3 expression in G1, G2, and G5 cell clones of HCT116 CRC cells is controlled by doxycycline. We used HCT116 and HCT116+3 as negative controls and HCT116+3+5 as a positive control for MSH3 expression. HCT116 and HCT116+3 cells showed no detectable MSH3 protein expression (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with HCT116 cells harboring homozygous frameshift mutations in a mononucleotide repeat of the MSH3 exon 7 (23Haugen A.C. Goel A. Yamada K. Marra G. Nguyen T.P. Nagasaka T. Kanazawa S. Koike J. Kikuchi Y. Zhong X. Arita M. Shibuya K. Oshimura M. Hemmi H. Boland C.R. Koi M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8465-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). HCT116+3+5, generated from MSH3-deficient HCT116+3 by transfer of a copy of chromosome 5, showed MSH3 expression. Although no MSH3 was detected in G1, G2 and G5 clones in the absence of doxycycline, addition of doxycycline restored MSH3 expression in all of these clones to ∼40–60% of the levels of parental HCT116+3+5 (Fig. 1, A and B). We believe it is technically challenging to expect complete blockade for the production of MSH3 shRNA in these cell lines even in the presence of doxycycline. However, we think this protein level is enough to analyze the effect of MSH3 on drug sensitivity in this study because we have shown previously that this level of MSH3 in G5 cells is enough to recover MSH3 functions regarding the EMAST phenotype in vitro (23Haugen A.C.

To determine whether MSH3 status affects cellular sensitivity to two platinum drugs, we first examined the clonogenic survival of HCT116 and HCT116-derived cell lines in cisplatin-treated cells. No significant differences in cisplatin sensitivity were observed between MLH1 and MSH3-deficient HCT116 and MSH3-deficient HCT116+3 cell lines, whereas higher resistance was observed in MSH3-proficient HCT116+3+5 cell lines (Fig. 2A). Among various cell lines, the MSH3-deficient G5 clone was more sensitive than its parental HCT116+3+5 (Fig. 2A). To further confirm that MSH3 existence influenced cytotoxicity induced by cisplatin, we compared the clonogenic survival of G5 cells in the presence and absence of doxycycline. We found that restoration of MSH3 expression desensitized the cells to cisplatin (5 μm; Fig. 2B). These results indicate that MSH3 depletion leads to the sensitization of cells to cisplatin. We also analyzed clonogenic survival of the other clones, G1 and G2 and found that these clones behaved similarly to G5 (data not shown). This further strengthened the possible role of MSH3 in the cytotoxicity caused by cisplatin. Next, we determined whether MSH3 deficiency also influenced cellular sensitivity to oxaliplatin. Surprisingly, the MSH3-deficient HCT116, HCT116+3, and G5 clones were significantly more sensitive to oxaliplatin than the parental HCT116+3+5, as was the case for cisplatin (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we observed that the restoration of MSH3 in the MSH3-deficient cells led to restoration of oxaliplatin insensitivity (Fig. 2D). Next, we compared the rate of growth inhibition and the levels of apoptosis between MSH3-proficient and -deficient cells after oxaliplatin treatment. We discovered that the degree of cell growth inhibition (Fig. 2E) and the levels of apoptosis were significantly higher (Fig. 2F) in MSH3-deficient cells than in MSH3-proficient cells, using flow cytometry. We also confirmed that cell proliferation was decreased, and the apoptotic fraction was increased in MSH3-deficient cells treated with oxaliplatin, using a BrdU assay and an immunofluorescence assay, respectively (Fig. 2, G and H). These results are consistent with our findings on growth inhibition obtained via clonogenic assays. To further confirm the role of MSH3-related sensitization to cisplatin and oxaliplatin, we next determined the clonogenic survival frequencies of cells transiently transfected with MSH3 siRNA and nontargeted siRNA. In these experiments, we confirmed that MSH3 protein expression was significantly diminished 72 h after siRNA transfection (98% MSH3 expression inhibition compared with untreated cells) in HCT116+3+5 cells (Fig. 3A). HCT116+3+5 cells were transfected with MSH3 siRNA, and the cells were exposed to cisplatin (5 and 10 μm) or oxaliplatin (2 and 5 μm) 48 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, transfection of MSH3 siRNA rendered HCT116+3+5 cells more susceptible to both cisplatin and oxaliplatin in comparison with cell lines transfected with nontargeted siRNA. To further confirm this increased sensitivity to platinum drugs in MSH3-depleted cells, we also transfected MSH3 siRNA or nontargeted siRNA into another colon cancer cell line, HT29. We confirmed that MSH3 was repressed almost completely in HT29 cells (Fig. 3D) and that HT29 cells treated with MSH3 siRNA became more sensitive to both cisplatin and oxaliplatin (Fig. 3, E and F). These results further strengthen our findings that MSH3 deficiency sensitizes cells to both cisplatin and oxaliplatin. From a clinical viewpoint, it is important to determine whether the MSH3 status influences sensitivity to cisplatin and oxaliplatin in patients with cancers that are also MLH1-deficient. To address this question, we compared the sensitivity of MSH3-deficient G5 cells and MSH3-proficient cells with cisplatin and oxaliplatin by inducing siRNA mediated down-regulation of MLH1 expression (Fig. 4A). When MLH1 was down-regulated in both HCT116+3+5 and G5 cells transfected with MLH1 siRNA, both cell lines became more resistant to N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in comparison with cell lines treated with nontargeted siRNA (Fig. 4B), validating the functional repression of MLH1 in our experimental conditions (10Koi M. Umar A. Chauhan D.P. Cherian S.P. Carethers J.M. Kunkel T.A. Boland C.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4308-4312PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hawn M.T. Umar A. Carethers J.M. Marra G. Kunkel T.A. Boland C.R. Koi M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3721-3725PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this scenario, we observed that G5 cells were more sensitive to cisplatin and oxaliplatin (2 and 5 μm) than HCT116+3+5 (Fig. 4, C and D). These results further support the notion that MSH3-dependent sensitivity to cisplatin and oxaliplatin occurs independently of MLH1 status. Platinum drugs induce DNA intrastrand cross-links and ICLs, and some of the lesions eventually lead to secondary DNA DSBs, presumably as a result of a collapsed replication fork (24Hinz J.M. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2010; 51: 582-603PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether MSH3 is involved in the repair of DSBs, we next analyzed time-dependent changes in the levels of nuclear pH2AX, a surrogate marker for DNA DSBs (25Bonner W.M. Redon C.E. Dickey J.S. Nakamura A.J. Sedelnikova O.A. Solier S. Pommier Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar) using immunofluorescence staining. We found that there were no differences in the number of pH2AX foci-positive cells before and after oxaliplatin treatment in the MSH3-proficient and -deficient cell lines. In contrast, we observed a lower rate of reduction in the number of pH2AX foci-positive cells in the MSH3-deficient G5 cells compared with both MSH3-restored G5 cells and the HCT116+3+5 cell lines during a 48- and 72-h treatment with oxaliplatin (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating that DSB repair is compromised only in MSH3-deficient cell lines. To further confirm this DSB repair inefficiency, we also performed immunofluorescence assays using an anti-53BP1 antibody, another marker for detecting DNA DSB. We confirmed sustained levels of 53BP1 in MSH3-deficient G5 cells after oxaliplatin treatment (Fig. 5, C and D). These results suggest that the higher sensitivity of MSH3-deficient cells to oxaliplatin may in part be due to reduced DNA DSB repair efficiency, rather than a quantitative difference in the burden of DNA damage induced by treatment. PARP inhibitors increase the number of single strand breaks, which eventually leads to DNA DSBs that are repaired by the HR system. HR-defective cells are hypersensitive to PARP inhibitors because of their inability to repair these DSBs (18Bryant H.E. Schultz N. Thomas H.D. Parker K.M. Flower D. Lopez E. Kyle S. Meuth M. Curtin N.J. Helleday T. Nature. 2005; 434: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar, 19Farmer H. McCabe N. Lord C.J. Tutt A.N. Johnson D.A. Richardson T.B. Santarosa M. Dillon K.J. Hickson I. Knights C. Martin N.M. Jackson S.P. Smith G.C. Ashworth A. Nature. 2005; 434: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (4441) Google Scholar). The possible role of MSH3 in DSB repair evidenced from our results (Fig. 5) prompted us to further examine whether MSH3-deficient cells are also sensitive to PARP inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 6A, MSH3-deficient G5 cells were more sensitive to olaparib than the MSH3-restored G5 cell line. These data clearly support the role of MSH3 in DSB repairs in CRC cells. Moreover, the combination of oxaliplatin and olaparib exhibited a synergistic effect in cytotoxicity in the MSH3-deficient G5 cells compared with the parental HCT116+3+5 cells. We also confirmed this effect in two other colon cancer cell lines HT29 (Fig. 6B) and SW480 (data not shown) in a transient knockdown system using MSH3 siRNA. These results suggest the promising potential for a combination therapy of platinum drugs and PARP inhibitors in MSH3-deficient cancers. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether loss of MSH3 affects cellular sensitivity to platinum drugs. It was anticipated that such data could lead to establishment of the diagnostic and therapeutic strategy that MSH3 status may be used as a predictive marker for chemotherapeutic outcome in patients with MSH3-deficient tumors. Using the isogenic colon cancer cell lines in which MSH3 expression is regulated by a Tet-off system, we demonstrate that the depletion of MSH3 expression in colon cancer cells sensitized them to cisplatin, and also to oxaliplatin and a PARP inhibitor. Our data suggest that these effects can be best explained by the reduced ability of MSH3-deficient cells to repair DSBs that are incurred following treatment with these drugs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that selective inhibition of MSH3 increases cellular sensitivity to platinum drugs and a PARP inhibitor. Moreover, we demonstrate that the MSH3-dependent increase in sensitivity to cisplatin and oxaliplatin is not influenced by down-regulation of MLH1 and is probably independent of the canonical MMR system. The role of MutS and MutL homologues in repair of ICLs has been well studied using psoralen ICLs (12Zhang N. Lu X. Zhang X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2388-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Zhao J. Jain A. Iyer R.R. Modrich P.L. Vasquez K.M.

These data suggest that MutSβ is involved in both recognition and processing of certain types of ICLs in cooperation with other proteins such as nucleotide excision repair and HR proteins and the fact that MutSβ also functions in ICL repair independent of its primary role in MMR. Our finding that MSH3-depleted cells are sensitive to cisplatin and oxaliplatin, and that this occurs independent of MLH1 function, is consistent with these findings with psoralen ICLs. Our results together with previous studies support the idea that MutSβ is involved in the repair of toxic DSBs induced by ICL adducts. First, there is existing evidence that MSH3 is co-localized to DSB lesions induced by laser (27Hong Z. Jiang J. Hashiguchi K. Hoshi M. Lan L. Yasui A. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3146-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and by carcinogens such as chromium(VI) (28Reynolds M.F. Peterson-Roth E.C. Bespalov I.A. Johnston T. Gurel V.M. Menard H.L. Zhitkovich A. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Second, we have observed sustained levels of pH2AX and 53BP1 that co-localize with DSBs in MSH3-deficient cells after oxaliplatin treatment compared with MSH3-proficient cells. Third, MSH3-deficient cells are sensitive to a PARP inhibitor that induces DSBs. Thus, our results suggest that unrepaired DSBs due to MSH3 deficiency are the direct cause of cell death. However, a recent study has shown that tumors occurring in MSH2-null mice are more resistant to cisplatin and the combination of 5-Fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin than tumors in mice that have MSH2 G674D mutations (29Kucherlapati M.H. Lee K. Nguyen A.A. Clark A.B. Hou Jr., H. Rosulek A. Li H. Yang K. Fan K. Lipkin M. Bronson R.T. Jelicks L. Kunkel T.A. Kucherlapati R. Edelmann W. Gastroenterology. 2010; 138: 993-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although this missense mutation results in loss of MMR activity, it still retains sensitivity to DNA damage. These results suggest that MSH2 has distinctive functions in MMR activity and chemosensitivity (29Kucherlapati M.H. Lee K. Nguyen A.A. Clark A.B. Hou Jr., H. Rosulek A. Li H. Yang K. Fan K. Lipkin M. Bronson R.T. Jelicks L. Kunkel T.A. Kucherlapati R. Edelmann W. Gastroenterology. 2010; 138: 993-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). MSH2 and MLH1 have been shown to be required for the activation of various proteins involved in apoptotic pathways such as JNK and c-Abl after cisplatin treatment (30Nehmé A. Baskaran R. Nebel S. Fink D. Howell S.B. Wang J.Y. Christen R.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); however, it is not clear whether MutSα or MutSβ or both are involved in the signaling pathways induced by cisplatin or oxaliplatin. However, because our results indicate that loss of MSH3 increases the sensitivity to cisplatin and oxaliplatin, it is likely that MutSβ is mainly involved in the repair of DNA damage, and MutSα is involved in both the repair and signaling pathways that lead to cell death. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact role of MutSα or MutSβ in repair for DNA damage and in damage signaling caused by these drugs. Our results regarding the sensitivity of MSH3-deficient cells to cisplatin and oxaliplatin are inconsistent with a previous report by Vaisman et al. (31Vaisman A. Varchenko M. Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Risinger J.I. Barrett J.C. Hamilton T.C. Chaney S.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3579-3585PubMed Google Scholar). That study reported that the sensitivity to these drugs did not differ between the MSH3-deficient HHUA cells and the MSH3-proficient HHUA complemented with chromosome 5 (31Vaisman A. Varchenko M. Umar A. Kunkel T.A. Risinger J.I. Barrett J.C. Hamilton T.C. Chaney S.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3579-3585PubMed Google Scholar). In their study, the influence by hundreds of other genes of chromosome 5 could not be excluded; therefore, we believe that our present data are more robust as we used isogenic clones of HCT116 colon cancer cells, in which MSH3 expression was regulated selectively as needed. From a clinical standpoint, our results suggest that a considerable population of patients with MSI CRC might benefit from oxaliplatin-based treatment regimens, PARP inhibitors, or in particular, a combination of the two. In CRC, many recent studies have shown that patients with stage III MSI cancer do not benefit from 5-Fluorouracil adjuvant chemotherapy (32Ribic C.M. Sargent D.J. Moore M.J. Thibodeau S.N. French A.J. Goldberg R.M. Hamilton S.R. Laurent-Puig P. Gryfe R. Shepherd L.E. Tu D. Redston M. Gallinger S. N. Engl. J.

Marsoni S. Monges G. Thibodeau S.N. Labianca R. Hamilton S.R. French A.J. Kabat B. Foster N.R. Torri V. Ribic C. Grothey A. Moore M. Zaniboni A. Seitz J.F. Sinicrope F. Gallinger S. J. Clin. Oncol. 2010; 28: 3219-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bertagnolli et al. (35Bertagnolli M.M. Niedzwiecki D. Compton C.C. Hahn H.P. Hall M. Damas B. Jewell S.D. Mayer R.J. Goldberg R.M. Saltz L.B. Warren R.S. Redston M. J. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 27: 1814-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) reported that patients with stage III MSI-CRC benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy containing 5-Fluorouracil and irinotecan, whereas another study has reported that these patients received no benefit from this adjuvant treatment (36Tejpar S. Bosman F. Delorenzi M. Fiocca R. Yan P. Klingbiel D. Dietrich D. Van Cutsem E. Labianca R. Roth A. J. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 27: 4001Crossref Google Scholar). These inconsistent results raise the possibility that there may be subgroups of patients that have different chemosensitivities among MSI CRC. For instance, our results suggest that there are at least two subpopulations of MLH1-deficient CRC, MSH3-proficient and MSH3-deficient CRC, and these may respond differentially to oxaliplatin, a PARP inhibitor, and their combination depending on the MSH3 status. Although our data indicate that MSH3-deficient cells are hypersensitive to combination therapy, a synergistic effect was even noted in the MSH3-proficient cells (Fig. 6). We speculate that MSH3 is just one of the several factors that determine cellular sensitivity to these drugs. The precise molecular details on the specific steps and how MSH3 or the MutSβ complex is involved in repair of platinum-induced DNA damage or PARP inhibitor-induced damage still remain elusive. Nonetheless, we believe that our data indicating this hypersensitivity of MSH3-deficient cancer cells especially to the combination therapy in comparison with MSH3-proficient cells at clinically relevant doses could have important clinical implications in terms of managing MSH3-deficient cancers in the future. In addition to MSH3, several other DNA repair genes are mutated in MSI cancers. MRE11A and RAD50, whose products are in the DSB repair complex MRE11A-hRAD50-NBS1, are among the most frequently mutated genes in MSI cancers (22Hewish M. Lord C.J. Martin S.A. Cunningham D. Ashworth A. Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2010; 7: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mutations in MRE11A and RAD50 have been shown to increase sensitivity to irinotecan, which induces secondary DSBs in cultured cells (37Vilar E. Scaltriti M. Balmaña J. Saura C. Guzman M. Arribas J. Baselga J. Tabernero J. Br. J. Cancer. 2008; 99: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 38Rodriguez R. Hansen L.T. Phear G. Scorah J. Spang-Thomsen M. Cox A. Helleday T. Meuth M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 5476-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have also confirmed that MSH3 deficiency sensitized cells to SN-38, an active metabolite of irinotecan (data not shown). Moreover, loss of the phosphatase and tensin homologue, another gene frequently mutated in MSI cancer, has been shown to sensitize cells to PARP inhibitors through inefficiency of HR repair (39Mendes-Pereira A.M. Martin S.A. Brough R. McCarthy A. Taylor J.R. Kim J.S. Waldman T. Lord C.J. Ashworth A. EMBO Mol. Med. 2009; 1: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 40McEllin B. Camacho C.V. Mukherjee B. Hahm B. Tomimatsu N. Bachoo R.M. Burma S. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, analyzing the genes or proteins that are involved in DSB repair could be helpful for predicting the therapeutic response in patients with MSI cancer. Clinical studies to validate predictive markers for drug therapy in MSI cancer are warranted. Previously, we demonstrated that loss of MSH3 expression caused the EMAST and MSI-low phenotypes and that focal loss of MSH3 expression was associated with EMAST in sporadic CRC tissues (23Haugen A.C. Goel A. Yamada K. Marra G. Nguyen T.P. Nagasaka T. Kanazawa S. Koike J. Kikuchi Y. Zhong X. Arita M. Shibuya K. Oshimura M. Hemmi H. Boland C.R. Koi M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8465-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, most MSI-low CRCs and some proportion of MSS tumors exhibited EMAST, suggesting that these tissues might have experienced MSH3 deficiency (23Haugen A.C. Goel A. Yamada K. Marra G. Nguyen T.P. Nagasaka T. Kanazawa S. Koike J. Kikuchi Y. Zhong X. Arita M. Shibuya K. Oshimura M. Hemmi H. Boland C.R. Koi M. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8465-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). MSH3 deficiency is possibly related to disease progression in MLH1-deficient CRC (20Plaschke J. Krüger S. Jeske B. Theissig F. Kreuz F.R. Pistorius S. Saeger H.D. Iaccarino I. Marra G. Schackert H.K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and MSI-low CRCs have poor prognosis (41Kohonen-Corish M.R. Daniel J.J. Chan C. Lin B.P. Kwun S.Y. Dent O.F. Dhillon V.S.

Leggett B.A. Jass J.R. Macdonald G.A. Gut. 2005; 54: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that loss of MSH3 may be related to the promotion of metastasis or recurrence of CRC. In this scenario, treatment of sporadic CRC containing MSH3-negative cancer cell populations with platinum drugs or PARP inhibitors, or both, may inhibit disease progression. In conclusion, we show that MSH3-deficient cells are sensitive to cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and a PARP inhibitor, possibly resulting from reduced repair of DNA DSBs. Our findings could contribute to a better understanding of the role of MSH3 in DNA repair and drug sensitivity and to better predicting and improving the therapeutic outcome of patients with MSH3-deficient cancers.

https://openalex.org/W2062242556,"Heath facility-based sentinel site surveillance has been proposed as a means of monitoring trends in malaria morbidity but may also provide an opportunity to improve malaria case management. Here we described the impact of a sentinel site malaria surveillance system on promoting laboratory testing and rational antimalarial drug use.Sentinel site malaria surveillance was established at six health facilities in Uganda between September 2006 and January 2007. Data were collected from all patients presenting to the outpatient departments including demographics, laboratory results, diagnoses, and treatments prescribed. Between the start of surveillance and March 2010, a total 424,701 patients were seen of which 229,375 (54%) were suspected of having malaria. Comparing the first three months with the last three months of surveillance, the proportion of patients with suspected malaria who underwent diagnostic testing increased from 39% to 97% (p<0.001). The proportion of patients with an appropriate decision to prescribe antimalarial therapy (positive test result prescribed, negative test result not prescribed) increased from 64% to 95% (p<0.001). The proportion of patients appropriately prescribed antimalarial therapy who were prescribed the recommended first-line regimen artemether-lumefantrine increased from 48% to 69% (p<0.001).The establishment of a sentinel site malaria surveillance system in Uganda achieved almost universal utilization of diagnostic testing in patients with suspected malaria and appropriate decisions to prescribed antimalarial based on test results. Less success was achieved in promoting prescribing practice for the recommended first-line therapy. This system could provide a model for improving malaria case management in other health facilities in Africa."

Other viral gene transfer vectors such as lentiviruses have also allowed successful reprogramming (12Brambrink T. Foreman R. Welstead G.G. Lengner C.J. Wernig M. Suh H. Jaenisch R.

The constitutive retroviral and lentiviral vectors commonly used for reprogramming allow efficient generation of iPS cells from mouse and human somatic cells. However, their permanent integration into the genome limits their use for eventual therapeutic applications due to the risk of both insertional mutagenesis and particularly the reactivation of the reprogramming factors leading to tumor formation (14Nakagawa M.

So far, the simplest protocols for generating transgene-free iPS rely on serial transfection and transient expression of CAG-driven vectors expressing the whole set of reprogramming factors as a single polycistronic transcript, thereafter translated into separate proteins via a ribosomal skipping mechanism allowed by the insertion of the 2A peptide sequence of picornavirus (24Ryan M.D. Drew J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) between the cDNAs encoding each transcription factor (17Gonzalez F. Barragan Monasterio M. Tiscornia G. Montserrat Pulido N.

Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Science. 2008; 322: 949-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). Following this strategy, Okita et al. (19Okita K. Nakagawa M. Hyenjong H. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Science. 2008; 322: 949-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar) obtained mouse iPS lines from MEFs showing no evidence of integration. They performed four serial transfections with FuGENE to transiently express two plasmids (one expressing c-myc and a second construct expressing Oct4, Klf4, and Sox2 as a polycistronic unit). Similarly, we reported that iPS lines without transgene integration can be generated in the mouse by nucleofection of a single plasmid construct expressing OSKM as a single polycistronic unit (17Gonzalez F. Barragan Monasterio M. Tiscornia G. Montserrat Pulido N. Vassena R. Batlle Morera L. Rodriguez Piza I. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8918-8922Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the reprogramming protocols described in these works were only applied to MEFs and showed much lower efficiency of iPS generation (<0.001%) when compared with viral induction (∼0.01%). Therefore, the induction of iPS cells from other tissue origins or other species by these methods will eventually require many improvements. Reprogramming of human fibroblasts is known to require longer expression periods of reprogramming factors than MEFs, and their induction efficiency of iPS generation is reported to be very low (25Maherali N. Ahfeldt T. Rigamonti A. Utikal J. Cowan C. Hochedlinger K. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In addition, delivery of large DNA constructs, such as the polycistronic constructs used for reprogramming using conventional transfection methods such as liposome or nucleofection, have typically achieved low transfection efficiencies, short periods of transgene expression, and low cell viability. Therefore, in an attempt to generate transgene-free human iPS cells by transient expression of a single non-viral polycistronic vector in human foreskin fibroblasts, we used poly-β-amino esters as the transfection reagent to transiently express Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-myc, and a GFP reporter gene (pCAG-OSKMG). Poly-β-amino esters are a class of polycations that were first developed by Langer and co-workers (26Anderson D.G. Lynn D.M. Langer R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 3153-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 27Anderson D.G. Akinc A. Hossain N. Langer R. Mol.

This group has recently described the use of these polymers to successfully deliver a VEGF plasmid into human mesenchymal stem cells and mesenchymal-like stem cells derived from human embryonic stem cells to enhance angiogenesis (30Yang F. Cho S.W. Son S.M. Bogatyrev S.R. Singh D. Green J.J. Mei Y. Park S. Bhang S.H. Kim B.S. Langer R. Anderson D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 3317-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In this work we successfully delivered a large vector of ∼11 kb into human fibroblasts using poly-β-amino esters, achieving higher efficiencies when compared with conventional commercial transfection reagents, such as Lipofectamine and FuGENE. Moreover, after an optimized protocol of 2 or 3 consecutive transfections, we generated human iPS cells in ∼20–28 days. These iPS cell lines expressed the typical set of pluripotency marker genes, had a stable karyotypes, and were able to differentiate in vitro into derivatives of the three germ layers. Although our approach did not allow the generation of transgene-free iPS cell lines, it represents a simple non-viral alternative to produce iPS cells from human fibroblasts, avoiding the time-consuming and labor-intensive task of producing and working with potentially harmful retroviral or lentiviral particles overexpressing potent oncogenes such as c-Myc. Poly-β-aminoesters were synthesized by the addition reaction of primary amines with excess of diol diacrylates. End-capping modification of acrylate-terminated polymers with different kind of diamines improves the ability of the polymers to complex DNA. Three different end-modified poly-β-aminoesters were synthesized after a two-step procedure described elsewhere (28Green J. Zugates G. Tedford N. Huang Y. Griffith L. Lauffenburger D. Sawicki J.A.

Lett. 2008; 8: 3126-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Chemicals were obtained from Sigma and Panreac and used as received. Phosphate-buffered saline (1×) was purchased from Invitrogen. First, acrylate-terminated poly-5-amino-1-pentanol-co-1,4-butanediol diacrylate was synthesized by the addition of 5-amino-1-pentanol (3.44 g, 33 mmol) to 1,4-butanediol diacrylate (7.93 g, 40 mmol) at a 1.2:1 molar ratio of diacrylate monomer to amine monomer. Polymerization was performed under magnetic stirring at 90 °C for 24 h. Afterward, the poly-5-amino-1-pentanol-co-1,4-butanediol diacrylate obtained was end-modified with three different amine monomers. Freshly synthesized poly-5-amino-1-pentanol-co-1,4-butanediol diacrylate was dissolved in THF (1 g, 2 mmol in 2 ml of THF). Then a solution of each amine monomer, 1) 1,3-diaminopropane (0.148 g, 167 μl, 2 mmol) in THF (8 ml), 2) 1,3-diaminopentane (0.204 g, 239 μl, 2 mmol) in THF (8 ml), or 3) 2-methyl-1,5-pentanediamine (0.232 g, 270 μl, 2 mmol) in THF (8 ml), was added to the poly5-amino-1-pentanol-co-1,4-butanediol diacrylate solution and stirred magnetically overnight at room temperature. Each resulting amino-terminated polymer (B1, B2, and B3) was isolated by precipitation in diethyl ether (100 ml) and dried under vacuum. Synthesized structures were confirmed by 1H NMR and FTIR analysis. NMR spectra were recorded in a 400 MHz Varian (Varian NMR Instruments, Claredon Hills, IL) and methanol-d4 was used as the solvent. IR spectra were obtained using a Nicolet Magna 560(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with a KBr beamsplitter using methanol as the solvent in evaporated film. pmaxGFP plasmid (3486 bp) was purchased from Amaxa and used as a control of transfection. pCAG-OSKMG plasmid (11000 bp), which is a vector expressing the whole set of reprogramming factors as a single polycistronic transcript, was previously developed by our group (17Gonzalez F. Barragan Monasterio M. Tiscornia G. Montserrat Pulido N. Vassena R. Batlle Morera L. Rodriguez Piza I. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8918-8922Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Human foreskin fibroblasts were transfected with pmaxGFP plasmid or pCAG-OSKMG plasmid in Opti-MEM medium using the three different poly-β-amino esters. Initial cell density (200,000, 400,000, or 800,000 cells/well of a 6-well plate), amounts of DNA (2.5, 5, or 10 μg/well), DNA to polymer ratio (1:20, 1:40, 1:50, 1:80, or 1:100), and time of transfection (30 min or 1, 2, or 3 h) were optimized to define the optimal conditions for the transfection of the large pCAG-OSKMG plasmid. Polyplexes were formulated by mixing the poly-β-amino esters (B1, B2, and B3) with the plasmids at different ratios (w/w) of DNA to polymer (between 1:20 to 1:100). Briefly, DNA was first dissolved to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in a 25 mm sodium acetate buffer solution at pH 5.2 (NaAc buffer), which was prepared from a 3 m stock (Sigma). The appropriate amount of B1, B2, or B3 polymers at 20 mg/ml in DMSO was then added to the DNA solution and mixed for some seconds. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature to allow for nanoparticle self-assembly, the particle solution was added to cells and incubated for 1 h. After 1 h of incubation, the medium was replaced by fresh growth medium. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and FuGENE HD, two commercially available transfection reagents, were used according to manufacturer's instructions for comparing the efficiency of transfection. Particle size and ζ potential measurements were recorded using a Zetasizer Nano series ZS dynamic Light scattering detector (Malvern Instruments Ltd., 4-milliwatt laser, incident beam 633 nm). Correlation functions were collected at an scattering angle of 90°, and particle sizes were calculated using the Malvern particle sizing software (DTS Version 5.03) using the viscosity and refractive index of water at 25 °C. The efficiency of transfection of pmaxGFP and pCAG-OSKMG plasmids into human fibroblasts was determined by means of GFP-expressing cells 24 h after the transfection. Green fluorescent protein expression was measured using fluorescence-activated cell sorting on a MoFlo cell sorter (DakoCytomation) applying Summit software. Propidium iodide staining was used to exclude dead cells from the analysis. Human foreskin fibroblasts p2 were seeded in 6-well plates at a defined cell density (100,000, 400,000, or 800,000 cells/well) with DMEM medium containing 10% of FBS (fibroblast medium). The next day cells were transfected with pCAG-OSKMG plasmid using poly-β-amino esters. For an optimal transfection polymer-DNA complexes were prepared at 1/50 ratio with 10 μg of DNA (diluted in AcO buffer, pH 5.5, to 0.1 mg/ml) and 25 μl of the polymer at 20 mg/ml for each well of a 6-well plate. Serial transfections with poly-β-amino esters were performed as shown in the timeline depicted in Fig. 3A. After the last transfection fibroblast medium was changed by human embryonic stem cell growth medium, and cells were maintained for 1 week with daily media changes. After 1 week, cells were trypsinized and transferred onto irradiated human feeders using a 1:6 dilution. Approximately, 20–28 days after the plating onto human feeders, the first iPS cell-like colonies appeared. The integration of the transgene was analyzed by PCR. 50 ng of genomic DNA were amplified with Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science) by using two pairs of primers spanning two different areas of the pCAG-OSKMG vector (OS primers amplify a fragment of the pCAG-OSKMG vector between Oct4 and Sox2: forward (5′-TTCCCTCTGTTCCCGTCACT-3′) and reverse (5′-GCTTGCTGATCTCCGAGTTG-3′), and K1/2 primers amplify a fragment of the pCAG-OSKMG vector in Klf4: forward (5′-AACACACACGACTTCCCCCT-3′) and reverse (5′-GTGGGTGGCTGTTCTTTTCC-3′)). Total RNA from each cell line was isolated using All Prep DNA/RNA columns (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's guidelines. All RNA samples were treated with TURBO DNase inhibitor (Ambion) to remove any residual genomic DNA, and 1 μg of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using the Invitrogen SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase kit. 25 ng of cDNA were used to quantify typically pluripotency gene expression markers by using Platinum Syber Green qPCR Super Mix (Invitrogen) in an ABI Prism 7000 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) and primers as previously described (10Aasen T. Raya A. Barrero M.J. Garreta E. Consiglio A. Gonzalez F. Vassena R. Biliæ J. Pekarik V. Tiscornia G. Edel M. Boué S. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1276-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Values were normalized to Gapdh. Similarly, 25 ng of cDNA were used to determine the level of transgene expression using primers that amplify a fragment of the transgene (forward (5′-AAAAGGCCCCCAAGGTAGTG-3′) and reverse (5′-CGGTGGTCCAGATGAACTTC-3′)). Cells were grown on plastic cover slide chambers fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The following antibodies were used: TRA-1-81 (MAB4381, 1:100) from Chemicon, SSEA-3 (MC-631, 1:2) from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa, OCT-3/4 (C-10, Santa Cruz, sc-5279, 1:100), NANOG (Everest Biotech EB06860, 1:100), Tuj1 (Covance, 1:500), GFAP (Dako, 1:1000), α-fetoprotein (Dako, 1:400), FOXA-2 (R&D System, 1:50), smooth muscle actin (Sigma, 1:400), α-sarcomeric actinin (Sigma, 1:200), and anti-GFP (Aves, 1:250). Images were taken using Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Direct AP activity was analyzed using an alkaline phosphatase blue membrane substrate solution kit (Sigma, AB0300) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The analysis was performed on 80% confluent cells growing on Matrigel. Cells were treated with colcemid at 20 ng/ml followed by 45 min of incubation at 37 °C. Then, after trypsinizing the cells into a single cell suspension, they were treated with Carnoy fixative at −20 °C. Finally, the samples were analyzed with the software Cytovision (Applied Imaging). After 3–4 days, the embryoid bodies were transferred to 0.1% gelatin-coated glass chamber slides and cultured in differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, nonessential amino acids, and penicillin-streptomycin) for 2–3 weeks to allow spontaneous endoderm formation. The medium was changed every other day. For mesoderm/cardiomyocyte differentiation, embryoid bodies were maintained on gelatin-coated plate in differentiated medium supplemented with 100 μm ascorbic acid (Sigma). For ectoderm differentiation, embryoid bodies were cultured on Matrigel-coated plates in N2/B27 medium supplemented with 1 μm retinoic acid for 2–3 weeks. Severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) beige male mice, 8 weeks old approximately, were injected with hiPS cells (1 million for each injection site, approximately) subcutaneously in the testicular parenchyma. All procedures involving animals were approved by the institutional Animal Ethical Board, and the protocols were approved by the Conselleria De Salut of Cataluña. Briefly, the mice were briefly anesthetized with a gaseous mixture of halothane:oxygen:ambient air of 0.5:2:97.5. Injections were performed using a 1-ml syringe with a G25 needle. No more than 150 μl of cell suspension were injected. The mice were sacrificed 8 weeks after the injections or when a tumor was detected by palpation, whichever came first. Tumor samples were collected generally in 2 months and processed for paraffin embedding and hematoxylin and eosin staining following standard procedures. Preliminary data showed that transfection of human fibroblasts with pCAG-OSKMG vector using Lipofectamine, FuGENE, or nucleofection resulted in very low transfection efficiencies (lower than 8%) and low cell viability (lower than 50%). Thus, we aimed to improve the transfection efficiency of the large DNA vector pCAG-OSKMG to optimize a method of reprogramming of human fibroblasts by transient expression of the reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc. For this purpose we chose poly-β-amino esters as good candidates for transfection of human cells and investigated the ability of these polymers to transfect pCAG-OSKMG into human fibroblasts. Poly-β-amino esters are a kind of biocompatible polymers that are able to complex DNA by electrostatic interactions forming nanoparticles suitable for gene delivery applications. The presence of ester bonds in their chemical structure confers them the properties of biodegradability and low toxicity. In addition, they are easy to synthesize by a conjugate addition of amine monomers to diacrylates without the production of any byproducts. The development of a large library of 2350 structurally unique poly-β-amino esters using high-throughput combinatorial chemistry was previously reported (26Anderson D.G. Lynn D.M. Langer R. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 3153-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 27Anderson D.G. Akinc A. Hossain N. Langer R. Mol. Ther. 2005; 11: 426-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In that study it was shown that one of the best performing polymers, called C32 polymer, was obtained from an amino alcohol and a hydrophobic diacrylate monomer. The chemical structure of this polymer is shown in Fig. 1A. Moreover, it was reported that chemical end-modification of C32 polymer by the reaction with diamine monomers resulted in improved biomaterials for gene delivery (31Green J.J. Zhou B.Y.

Res. 2008; 41: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Based on these previous reports, we have synthesized the three different end-modified poly-β-amino esters shown in Fig. 1B. Amine-terminated poly-β-amino esters polymers were obtained using a two-step procedure as previously described (28Green J. Zugates G. Tedford N. Huang Y. Griffith L. Lauffenburger D. Sawicki J.A. Langer R. Anderson D.G. Advanced Materials. 2007; 19: 2836-2842Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). B1, B2, and B3 amine-terminated poly-β-amino esters were characterized in terms of molecular structure by 1H NMR and FTIR. 1H NMR spectra were consistent with previously published data (28Green J.

We next investigated the capacity of B1, B2, and B3 polymers to complex DNA and condense the pCAG-OSKMG vector into nanoparticles with appropriate biophysical properties for transfection. We used the pmaxGFP plasmid (4 kb) as the control plasmid for transfection, because as previously reported, the efficiency of transfection of plasmids around this size using these polymers is between 20 and 50% (33Yang F. Green J.J. Dinio T. Keung L. Cho S.W. Park H. Langer R. Anderson D.G. Gene Ther. 2009; 16: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A polymer complex of the pCAG-OSKMG plasmid was optimized based on visual analysis of GFP-expressing cells under a fluorescent microscope. Initial cell density (100,000, 400,000, or 800,000 cells/well of a 6-well plate), amounts of DNA (2.5, 5, or 10 μg/well), DNA to polymer ratio (1:20, 1:30, 1:40, 1:50, 1:80 or 1:100), and time of transfection (30 min and1, 2, or 3 h) were optimized to define the optimal conditions for the delivery of the large pCAG-OSKMG plasmid. It was found that high cell densities were required to efficiently transfect human fibroblasts with this system. Increased amounts of DNA also had a positive effect on the transfection efficiency. The optimal DNA to polymer ratio (w/w) was 1:50 for the 3 polymers, and incubation of the nanoparticles with the cells for 1 h was enough to allow cellular uptake (Fig. 2). Lower DNA to polymer ratios (1:20, 1:30, 1:40) resulted in insufficient comple"
https://openalex.org/W2128892894,"Receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) is a nuclear receptor coregulator that affects a wide spectrum of biological processes. It is unclear whether and how the expression level of RIP140 can be modulated and whether RIP140 is involved in inflammatory diseases. Here, we examine how intracellular cholesterol regulates RIP140 expression, and we evaluate the effect of RIP140 expression on macrophage proinflammatory potential. Macrophages treated with modified low-density lipoprotein express higher RIP140 mRNA and protein levels. Consistently, simvastatin reduces RIP140 levels, which can be reversed by mevalonate. Moreover, a high-fat diet elevates RIP140 but lowers miR-33 levels in peritoneal macrophages, and increases the production of IL-1β and TNF-α in macrophages. Mechanistically, miR-33 targets RIP140 mRNA by recognizing its target located in a highly conserved sequence of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of RIP140 mRNA. Consequentially, miR-33 reduces RIP140 coactivator activity for NF-κB, which is supported by the reduction in NF-κB reporter activity and the inflammatory potential in macrophages. This study uncovers a cholesterol-miR-33-RIP140 regulatory pathway that modulates the proinflammatory potential in macrophages in response to an alteration in the intracellular cholesterol status, and identifies RIP140 as a direct target of miR-33 that mediates simvastatin-triggered anti-inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2039190990,"Epidemiologic studies indirectly suggest that air pollution accelerates atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that individual exposure to particulate matter (PM) derived from fossil fuel would correlate with plasma concentrations of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL), taken as a marker of atherosclerosis. We tested this hypothesis in patients with diabetes, who are at high risk for atherosclerosis.In a cross-sectional study of non-smoking adult outpatients with diabetes we assessed individual chronic exposure to PM by measuring the area occupied by carbon in airway macrophages, collected by sputum induction and by determining the distance from the patient's residence to a major road, through geocoding. These exposure indices were regressed against plasma concentrations of oxidized LDL, von Willebrand factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). We could assess the carbon load of airway macrophages in 79 subjects (58 percent). Each doubling in the distance of residence from major roads was associated with a 0.027 µm(2) decrease (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.048 to -0.0051) in the carbon load of airway macrophages. Independently from other covariates, we found that each increase of 0.25 µm(2) [interquartile range (IQR)] in carbon load was associated with an increase of 7.3 U/L (95% CI: 1.3 to 13.3) in plasma oxidized LDL. Each doubling in distance of residence from major roads was associated with a decrease of -2.9 U/L (95% CI: -5.2 to -0.72) in oxidized LDL. Neither the carbon load of macrophages nor the distance from residence to major roads, were associated with plasma von Willebrand factor or PAI-1.The observed positive association, in a susceptible group of the general population, between plasma oxidized LDL levels and either the carbon load of airway macrophages or the proximity of the subject's residence to busy roads suggests a proatherogenic effect of traffic air pollution."
https://openalex.org/W2090165847,"The AKT/PI3K/mTOR pathway is frequently altered in a range of human tumours, including bladder cancer. Here we report the phenotype of mice characterised by deletion of two key players in mTOR regulation, Pten and Lkb1, in a range of tissues including the mouse urothelium. Despite widespread recombination within the range of epithelial tissues, the primary phenotype we observe is the rapid onset of bladder tumorigenesis, with median onset of approximately 100 days. Single deletion of either Pten or Lkb1 had no effect on bladder cell proliferation or tumour formation. However, simultaneous deletion of Lkb1 and Pten led to an upregulation of the mTOR pathway and the hypoxia marker GLUT1, increased bladder epithelial cell proliferation and ultimately tumorigenesis. Bladder tissue also exhibited characteristic features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, with loss of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and the tight junction protein ZO-1, and increases in the mesenchymal marker vimentin as well as nuclear localization of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulator Snail. We show that these effects were all dependent upon mTOR activity, as rapamycin treatment blocked both EMT and tumorigenesis. Our data therefore establish clear synergy between Lkb1 and Pten in controlling the mTOR pathway within bladder epithelium, and show that loss of this control leads to the disturbance of epithelial structure, EMT and ultimately tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2108269160,"Adequate termination of an immune response is as important as the induction of an appropriate response. CD46, a regulator of complement activity, promotes T cell activation and differentiation towards a regulatory Tr1 phenotype. This Tr1 differentiation pathway is defective in patients with MS, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, underlying its importance in controlling T cell function and the need to understand its regulatory mechanisms. CD46 has two cytoplasmic tails, Cyt1 and Cyt2, derived from alternative splicing, which are co-expressed in all nucleated human cells. The regulation of their expression and precise functions in regulating human T cell activation has not been fully elucidated.Here, we first report the novel role of CD46 in terminating T cell activation. Second, we demonstrate that its functions as an activator and inhibitor of T cell responses are mediated through the temporal processing of its cytoplasmic tails. Cyt1 processing is required to turn T cell activation on, while processing of Cyt2 switches T cell activation off, as demonstrated by proliferation, CD25 expression and cytokine secretion. Both tails require processing by Presenilin/γSecretase (P/γS) to exert these functions. This was confirmed by expressing wild-type Cyt1 and Cyt2 tails and uncleavable mutant tails in primary T cells. The role of CD46 tails was also demonstrated with T cells expressing CD19 ectodomain-CD46 C-Terminal Fragment (CTF) fusions, which allowed specific triggering of each tail individually.We conclude that CD46 acts as a molecular rheostat to control human T cell activation through the regulation of processing of its cytoplasmic tails."
https://openalex.org/W2110236942,"The mammalian embryo relies on maternal circulating retinoids (vitamin A derivatives) for development. β-Carotene is the major human dietary provitamin A. β-Carotene-15,15'-oxygenase (CMOI) has been proposed as the main enzyme generating retinoid from β-carotene in vivo. CMOI is expressed in embryonic tissues, suggesting that β-carotene provides retinoids locally during development. We performed loss of CMOI function studies in mice lacking retinol-binding protein (RBP), an established model of embryonic vitamin A deficiency (VAD). We show that, unexpectedly, lack of CMOI in the developing tissues further exacerbates the severity of VAD and thus the embryonic malformations of RBP(-/-) mice. Since β-carotene was not present in any of the mouse diets, we unveiled a novel action of CMOI independent from its β-carotene cleavage activity. We also show for the first time that CMOI exerts an additional function on retinoid metabolism by influencing retinyl ester formation via modulation of lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) activity, at least in developing tissues. Finally, we demonstrate unequivocally that β-carotene can serve as an alternative vitamin A source for the in situ synthesis of retinoids in developing tissues by the action of CMOI."
https://openalex.org/W2005873811,"Secretins are a family of large bacterial outer membrane protein complexes mediating the transport of complex structures, such as type IV pili, DNA and filamentous phage, or various proteins, such as extracellular enzymes and pathogenicity determinants. PilQ of the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB27 is a member of the secretin family required for natural transformation. Here we report the isolation, structural, and functional analyses of a unique PilQ from T. thermophilus. Native PAGE, gel filtration chromatography, and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses indicated that PilQ forms a macromolecular homopolymeric complex that binds dsDNA. Electron microscopy showed that the PilQ complex is 15 nm wide and 34 nm long and consists of an extraordinary stable “cone” and “cup” structure and five ring structures with a large central channel. Moreover, the electron microscopic images together with secondary structure analyses combined with structural data of type II protein secretion system and type III protein secretion system secretins suggest that the individual rings are formed by conserved domains of alternating α-helices and β-sheets. The unprecedented length of the PilQ complex correlated well with the distance between the inner and outer membrane of T. thermophilus. Indeed, PilQ was found immunologically in both membranes, indicating that the PilQ complex spans the entire cell periphery of T. thermophilus. This is consistent with the hypothesis that PilQ accommodates a PilA4 comprising pseudopilus mediating DNA transport across the outer membrane and periplasmic space in a single-step process.

Natural genetic transformation permits the exchange of DNA among organisms of different domains, and therefore, is suggested to be a driving force for bacterial adaptation and genome evolution (1Johnsborg O.

DNA uptake involves the assembly, action, and regulation of macromolecular DNA transport machineries that span the entire cell wall as well as the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. DNA translocators are similar to and sometimes even share components with type IV pili (T4P), 2The abbreviations used are: T4P, type IV pili; T2SS, type II protein secretion systems; T3SS, type III protein secretion systems; IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane. filamentous phage secretion, type II protein secretion systems (T2SS), and type III protein secretion systems (T3SS) (4Hobbs M.

Moreover, in many Gram-negative bacteria, such as Neisseria, Pseudomonas, and Thermus, natural transformation is coupled to pilus expression (5Tønjum T. Freitag N.E. Namork E. Koomey M. Mol.

Despite the broad analyses of DNA translocator proteins, information on the structure and function of these complex transport machineries is scarce (3Averhoff B. J. Bioenerg.

Extensive studies performed with different Gram-negative mesophilic bacteria suggest at least three distinct substructures: a pilus-like rod that extends from the cytoplasmic membrane through the periplasm to the outer membrane; a ring-like structure, made by multiple copies of the secretin protein, guiding the rod through the outer membrane; and an inner membrane transporter. A cytoplasmic motor domain that powers assembly of the rod is associated with the transporter. In analogy to the dynamic T4P, it is widely assumed that DNA translocators are highly dynamic structures (3Averhoff B. J. Bioenerg.

DNA is suggested to bind to the pilus-like rod, and then the translocator might retract, thus transporting DNA through a pore in the outer membrane composed of secretins, although it has to be noted that the mechanism of DNA binding and transport is still an open question. The preceding hypothesis is corroborated by the observation that T4P are highly dynamic machineries, which have been shown to bind DNA (16Maier B. Koomey M. Sheetz M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To get insights into the structure and function of natural transformation machineries, we chose the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB27 as model bacterium for molecular analyses of DNA uptake systems. A whole genome approach implying insertional mutagenesis followed by characterization of the mutants led to the identification of 16 competence proteins (9Friedrich A. Prust C. Hartsch T. Henne A. Averhoff B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Friedrich A. Hartsch T. Averhoff B. Appl. Environ.

Microbiol. 2003; 69: 3695-3700Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which can be assigned to three different groups based on similarities to known proteins. 1) The first group consists of DNA translocator-specific proteins, such as ComEA and ComEC, which are suggested to be involved in DNA binding and transport across the inner membrane. 2) The second group consists of T4P-related proteins, such as four pilin-like proteins, PilA1–4, which might form a pseudopilus DNA translocator. This DNA translocator is suggested to be guided through the outer membrane (OM) by the secretin-like competence protein PilQ. These suggestions are supported by the finding that a pilQ mutant is devoid of PilA4 in the OM (22Rumszauer J. Schwarzenlander C. Averhoff B. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3261-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PilF, a traffic NTPase that has been purified and found to exhibit NTPase activities, is suggested to power the DNA translocator (23Rose I. Biukovic G. Aderhold P. Müller V. Grüber G. Averhoff B. Extremophiles. 2011; (January 6, 10.1007/s00792–010-0343-2)PubMed Google Scholar). 3) In addition to these T4P-related proteins, PilM, a member of the actin family, and four novel competence proteins, ComZ, PilN, PilO, and PilW, were found to be essential for natural transformation in T. thermophilus. The inner membrane (IM) localization together with the results from mutant studies suggest that PilM, PilN, PilO, and PilW are components of the DNA translocator platform in the IM implicated in the biogenesis of the transporter complex and/or that they aid transport of DNA across the IM channel (22Rumszauer J. Schwarzenlander C. Averhoff B. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3261-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Schwarzenlander C. Haase W. Averhoff B. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 11: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we have isolated a homooligomeric secretin from T. thermophilus HB27 encoded by pilQ. Its structure, as determined by electron microscopy, revealed a unique shape and size that is discussed in view of the unusual architecture of the T. thermophilus cell periphery and of its thermophilic lifestyle. In addition, its function as a potential DNA-binding protein was addressed with the purified protein. For the purification of PilQ, T. thermophilus HB27 was grown at 68 °C on TM+ complex medium containing 4 g of yeast extract, 8 g of Tryptone peptone, and 3 g of NaCl/liter, pH 7.5 (25Koyama Y. Hoshino T. Tomizuka N. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 338-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and harvested in the late exponential growth phase. Washed cells were resuspended in Sol buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and disrupted by sonification (30 s; duty cycle, 50%; output control, 5) followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to remove unbroken cells. The resulting whole cell lysate was analyzed on denaturing 3–12% polyacrylamide gradient SDS gels or on Blue native 3–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar, 27Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schägger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). The presence of PilQ was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant T. thermophilus HB27 PilQ (22Rumszauer J. Schwarzenlander C. Averhoff B. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3261-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Conditions for sample preparation, SDS-PAGE, electroblotting, and antigen detection (dilution of the antisera: 1:6666) have been described elsewhere (22Rumszauer J. Schwarzenlander C. Averhoff B. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3261-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Total membranes were separated from the soluble fraction by ultracentrifugation. Inner and outer membranes were prepared by N-laurylsarcosine extraction and by sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously (22Rumszauer J. Schwarzenlander C. Averhoff B. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3261-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Maier E. Polleichtner G. Boeck B. Schinzel R. Benz R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The purity of outer and inner membranes was verified by Western blot analyses of membrane fractions with antibodies directed against the S-Layer protein (outer membrane) and with antibodies directed against the inner membrane protein PilN of T. thermophilus HB27. To purify PilQ, Thermus cells were grown to the late exponential growth phase and washed with Sol buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol). 60 g of cells were resuspended in 200 ml of Sol buffer (including 0.5 mm PMSF) and disrupted by three passages through a French press followed by sonification (30 s; duty cycle, 50%; output control, 5). The membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 48,000 rpm for 1 h and washed once with Sol buffer containing 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Washed membranes were resuspended in Sol buffer again, and Triton X-100 was added (3 g/g of protein). Solubilized proteins were separated from membranes by ultracentrifugation (48,000 rpm, 4 °C, 1 h). 4% SDS was added to the solubilizate, and the sample was then loaded on a continuous 15–50% (w/v) sucrose gradient (in Sol buffer and 0.1% Triton X-100) and ultracentrifuged at 48,000 rpm and 4 °C for 24 h. PilQ-containing fractions were pooled and diluted with Sol buffer (including 0.1% Triton X-100) without NaCl in a 1:4 ratio to obtain a NaCl concentration of about 100 mm. Samples were loaded on a Q-Sepharose, and bound proteins were eluted by a gradient from 100 mm NaCl to 1 m NaCl (in Sol buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100). Fractions that contained PilQ were pooled and concentrated using a Vivaspin 20 column. The concentrated samples were loaded on a Superose 6 column and eluted with 1.5 column volumes of Sol buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. For detection, the fractions were applied to 3–12% polyacrylamide gradient SDS gels and immunoblotted against the PilQ antiserum. An alternative purification strategy was developed by taking advantage of the SDS resistance of PilQ. Therefore, membranes were treated with 10% SDS and incubated for 15 min at 100 °C. Membranes were separated via ultracentrifugation, and 0.1% Triton X-100 was added to the solubilized proteins, which were incubated at 4 °C overnight to remove the precipitating SDS. The supernatant was concentrated by a (NH4)2SO4 precipitation (20%) and solved in Sol buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Finally, the highly stable PilQ complex was separated by a continuous 15–40% (w/v) sucrose gradient centrifugation, and PilQ-containing fractions were pooled. To analyze the subunit composition, the purified PilQ complex was separated by Blue native-PAGE and electroeluted (27Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schägger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar) and treated with hot phenol as described by Hancock and Nikaido (29Hancock R.E. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 381-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phenol-treated PilQ complex was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. PilQ complexes were negatively stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Electron micrographs were collected using a Philips CM120 at 120 kV under low dose conditions, at a magnification of ×44,000 on Kodak SO-163 electron image film. Negatives checked by optical diffraction for correct defocus and a lack of drift and astigmatism were digitized on a PhotoScan scanner (Z/I Imaging, Aalen, Germany) at a pixel size of 7 μm. Subsequently, adjacent pixels were averaged to yield a pixel size on the specimen of 4.77 Å. Particles were selected using the boxer module from EMAN (30Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). The images were processed using Imagic V (31van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The images were band-pass-filtered and subjected to reference-free alignment and multivariate statistical analysis and classification. Images assigned to the same class were averaged. Probes were made by PCR from genomic DNA of T. thermophilus using primers ComEA-1 (5′-TTTGGAATTCAAGTGCGGGTGGAGGCCCTGGGAAAGGTC-3′) and ComEA-2 (5′-GAATAAGCTTAGGTCCAAGAAGGCCTCATGGCCGGAGGTAG-3′) and from genomic DNA of Halobacillus halophilus using primers RT-reg forward (5′-GATCAGATGACACTTGATG-3′) and RT-reg reverse (5′-AGCTTCCGTAATGGCTTC-3′). The resulting 250- and 230-bp DNA fragments, respectively, were purified and backfilled using Klenow large fragment with α-[32P]CTP and purified using the PCR purification kit from Roche Applied Science. For electromobility shift assays, the indicated quantities (5–200 nm) of the purified PilQ complex and 1 nm unlabeled dsDNA where resuspended in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol. The dsDNA fragments (1 nm, 30,000 cpm) were incubated with or without various amounts of the PilQ complex for 30 min at 37 and 68 °C, respectively, and separated on nondenaturating 3% polyacrylamide gels (in 1-fold Tris acetate/EDTA buffer). Gels were dried and subjected to phosphorimaging analyses using a Typhoon 9100 (GE Healthcare). For competition experiments, PilQ was incubated for 15 min with a 20-fold excess of unlabeled probe. Cell-free extracts of T. thermophilus were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to Western blot analysis with a PilQ antibody (Fig. 1, A and B). An 83-kDa protein reacted with the antibody (Fig. 1B). The apparent molecular mass fits well to the deduced mass of PilQ. In addition, three less abundant proteins of 72, 55, and 43 kDa reacted with the antibody, but they were also detected in a pilQ mutant, indicating that they do not represent degradation products of PilQ. Most interestingly, we reproducibly observed a large protein on top of the gel migrating very slowly. This protein reacted with the PilQ antibody and was not present in the pilQ mutant (Fig. 1B) and thus represents a PilQ-containing,-SDS resistant protein complex. This is consistent with secretin complexes of T2SS and phage secretion, such as PulD and pIV, which also exhibit SDS resistance (32Hardie K.R. Lory S. Pugsley A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 33Spagnuolo J. Opalka N. Wen W.X. Gagic D. Chabaud E. Bellini P. Bennett M.D. Norris G.E. Darst S.A. Russel M. Rakonjac J. Mol.

However, secretins exhibit different resistances against heat treatment, such that XcpQ, BfpB, TcpC, or OutD secretin complexes do not withstand boiling in standard Laemmli sample buffer (40Daniel A. Singh A. Crowther L.J. Fernandes P.J. Schreiber W. Donnenberg M.S. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 2405-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 41Bose N. Taylor R.K. J.

In contrast, the T. thermophilus PilQ complex was even detected in the membranes after boiling the membranes for 30 min in 10% SDS, suggesting an extraordinary high stability of the secretin complex (Fig. 1C). To determine the subcellular localization of the PilQ complex, total membranes were separated from the soluble fraction by ultracentrifugation, and IM and OM were further separated as described previously (22Rumszauer J. Schwarzenlander C. Averhoff B. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3261-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Successful separation of IM and OM was verified using antibodies against the S-layer protein (OM) and PilN (IM). Immunoblotting of the total membranes led to the detection of a PilQ complex retaining on top of the separating gel (Fig. 2, lane M). In addition, substantial amounts of the PilQ monomer and small amounts of PilQ degradation products were detected, and minor amounts of the PilQ monomer and the immunoreactive degradation products were also detected in the soluble fraction. Immunoblotting revealed that PilQ was insoluble in N-laurylsarcosine, which is indicative for PilQ being in the OM; minor amounts of PilQ were found to be sarcosyl-soluble (IM). This may reflect solubility of PilQ in sarcosyl to some extent. On the other hand, when outer and inner membranes were separated from each other by sucrose gradient centrifugation, the PilQ complex was also found to some minor extent in the inner membrane fraction (data not shown). The PilQ complex was purified from Thermus membranes by solubilization with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100, and the addition of 4% SDS to the membrane solubilizate prior to sucrose density gradient centrifugation was followed by anion exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose) and gel filtration (Superose 6). The pooled PilQ fractions after anion exchange chromatography revealed that several proteins copurified with the PilQ complex (Fig. 3, lane 5). After gel filtration, an apparently homogeneous PilQ preparation was obtained (Fig. 3, lane 6). Minor contaminants in the preparation varied from preparation to preparation and contained pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit E1 (102 kDa), chaperonin GroEL (57.8 kDa), a nonconserved 49-kDa protein (TTC1295), and a potential dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (44.5 kDa). To elucidate its subunit composition, the purified PilQ complex was subjected to Blue native-PAGE, electroeluted, and treated with hot phenol (29Hancock R.E. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 381-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, A and B (lane 2), this treatment leads to a dissociation of the PilQ complex and formation of PilQ monomers. Only PilQ monomers were detected after phenol treatment, which provides clear evidence that the PilQ complex is a homomultimer. The apparent molecular mass of the PilQ complex, as determined by Blue native-PAGE, corresponds to ∼960 kDa, which is consistent with a homopolymeric complex comprising 12 monomers (Fig. 4C). The purified PilQ complex was negatively stained and studied by electron microscopy. The sample shows long structures consisting of a number of stripes (Fig. 5A). About 2000 images were selected from 33 micrographs and aligned and classified, and images in the same class were averaged. All class averages showed the same view. The complex has a width of ∼15 nm and a length of 34 nm and consists of five distinct rings, each ∼3 nm thick, followed by a trapezoid density with a dense base (the “cup”) and a conical domain on the top. When membranes were treated with 10% SDS at 100 °C and PilQ was subsequently purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and sucrose density gradient centrifugation, the complex was smaller, with a height of ∼20 nm, consisting of the cone and cup domains as well as a faint image of the first of the five rings, but lacking the lower four rings (Fig. 5B). Presumably, SDS treatment denatures the protein domains forming the lower rings, but not the domains that retain the cone, the cup, and the first ring structure. The SDS-treated PilQ exhibited ring-shaped top views (Fig. 5C), which were not seen in negatively stained samples of the untreated complex with its 34-nm-high complexes. These top views are similar in appearance to other secretin complexes. The rings have a diameter of 15 nm and a thickness of ∼3 nm with a ∼6-nm hole in the center. Weak densities can be seen extending from the edge of the ring, indicating a subunit number of 12–14, which is consistent with the apparent molecular mass of the PilQ complex (Fig. 4C), but the exact number could not be determined unambiguously. In a previous work, we showed that T. thermophilus HB27 is able to bind and transport DNA from members of all three domains of life (24Schwarzenlander C. Haase W. Averhoff B. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 11: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mutant studies revealed that PilQ is implicated in DNA binding. To investigate the ability of the PilQ complex to bind DNA directly, bandshift assays were performed using radioactively labeled DNA from T. thermophilus and H. halophilus. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, Thermus PilQ is shifting dsDNA of H. halophilus in a concentration-dependent manner at 37 and 68 °C. Competition experiments indicate a specific interaction of the PilQ complex with dsDNA. Bandshift assays with Thermus DNA led to the same results (data not shown). Thus, the PilQ complex binds homologous and heterologous DNA. The secretin family is known to form oligomeric ring-like structures in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, which are specialized in translocating their particular substrates (36Bitter W. Koster M. Latijnhouwers M. de Cock H. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 37Koster M. Bitter W. de Cock H. Allaoui A. Cornelis G.R. Tommassen J.

Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here we show that Thermus PilQ forms oligomeric complexes in the membrane fraction and binds DNA. Through these PilQ complexes, pilus structures and the DNA translocator are thought to be extruded because deletion of the pilQ gene leads to a loss of transformation, piliation, and absence of PilA4 in the OM (9Friedrich A. Prust C. Hartsch T. Henne A. Averhoff B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 745-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Rumszauer J. Schwarzenlander C. Averhoff B. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3261-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The PilQ complex was found to be associated with the OM. Because the PilQ complex is part of the DNA translocator in Thermus, which is composed of several inner and outer membrane proteins and protein complexes, an association with the inner membrane is imaginable and might be important for translocating DNA across both membranes. Association with the inner membrane has been found for several secretins of secretion and pilus systems and is explained by trafficking to the outer membrane or interactions at the outer face of the inner membrane (41Bose N.

Indeed, we also found PilQ complex present to some minor extent in the sarcosyl fraction as well as in the inner membrane fraction after separation of IM and OM by density gradient centrifugation. Furthermore, we show that PilQ of T. thermophilus has the most complex structure of a secretin known to date; it measures ∼34 nm in height, and the height of this complex corresponds to the diameter of the extraordinary thick cell wall layers of T. thermophilus, comprising peptidoglycan covered by a thick layer of strongly bound secondary cell wall polymers (49Caston J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2003646327,"Signaling through cAMP regulates most cellular functions. The spatiotemporal control of cAMP is, therefore, crucial for differential regulation of specific cellular targets. Here we investigated the consequences of PDE4B or PDE4D gene ablation on cAMP signaling at a subcellular level using mouse embryonic fibroblasts. PDE4B ablation had no effect on the global or bulk cytosol accumulation of cAMP but increased both basal and hormone-dependent cAMP in a near-membrane pool. Conversely, PDE4D ablation enhanced agonist-induced cAMP accumulation in the bulk cytosol as well as at the plasma membrane. Both PDE4B and PDE4D ablation significantly modified the time course and the level of isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, a membrane cytoskeletal component. A second membrane response through Toll-like receptor signaling, however, was only affected by PDE4B ablation. PDE4D but not PDE4B ablation significantly prolonged cAMP-response element-binding protein-mediated transcription. These findings demonstrate that PDE4D and PDE4B have specialized functions in mouse embryonic fibroblasts with PDE4B controlling cAMP in a discrete subdomain near the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2059812351,"Nanoparticle (NP) exposure has been closely associated with the exacerbation and pathophysiology of many respiratory diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma. Mucus hypersecretion and accumulation in the airway are major clinical manifestations commonly found in these diseases. Among a broad spectrum of NPs, titanium dioxide (TiO2), one of the PM10 components, is widely utilized in the nanoindustry for manufacturing and processing of various commercial products. Although TiO2 NPs have been shown to induce cellular nanotoxicity and emphysema-like symptoms, whether TiO2 NPs can directly induce mucus secretion from airway cells is currently unknown. Herein, we showed that TiO2 NPs (<75 nm) can directly stimulate mucin secretion from human bronchial ChaGo-K1 epithelial cells via a Ca2+ signaling mediated pathway. The amount of mucin secreted was quantified with enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). The corresponding changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration were monitored with Rhod-2, a fluorescent Ca2+ dye. We found that TiO2 NP-evoked mucin secretion was a function of increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration resulting from an extracellular Ca2+ influx via membrane Ca2+ channels and cytosolic ER Ca2+ release. The calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) mechanism played a major role in further amplifying the intracellular Ca2+ signal and in sustaining a cytosolic Ca2+ increase. This study provides a potential mechanistic link between airborne NPs and the pathoetiology of pulmonary diseases involving mucus hypersecretion."

Recently, a glutaminyl cyclase (QC) inhibitor, PBD150, was shown to be able to reduce the deposition of pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-β peptides in brain of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer disease, leading to a significant improvement of learning and memory in those transgenic animals. Here, we report the 1.05–1.40 Å resolution structures, solved by the sulfur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing method, of the Golgi-luminal catalytic domain of the recently identified Golgi-resident QC (gQC) and its complex with PBD150. We also describe the high-resolution structures of secretory QC (sQC)-PBD150 complex and two other gQC-inhibitor complexes. gQC structure has a scaffold similar to that of sQC but with a relatively wider and negatively charged active site, suggesting a distinct substrate specificity from sQC. Upon binding to PBD150, a large loop movement in gQC allows the inhibitor to be tightly held in its active site primarily by hydrophobic interactions. Further comparisons of the inhibitor-bound structures revealed distinct interactions of the inhibitors with gQC and sQC, which are consistent with the results from our inhibitor assays reported here.

Iwatsubo T. Mann D.M. Shimada H. Ihara Y. Kawashima S. Neuron. 1995; 14: 457-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Because of their abundance, resistance to proteolysis, rapid aggregation, and neurotoxicity, the pGlu-modified amyloid-β peptides were suggested to play a crucial role in the initiation of pathological cascades, resulting in the development of Alzheimer disease (21Hook V. Schechter I. Demuth H.U. Hook G. Biol. Chem. 2008; 389: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on this hypothesis, QC inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of Alzheimer disease. Recently, Schilling et al. (13Schilling S. Zeitschel U. Hoffmann T. Heiser U. Francke M. Kehlen A. Holzer M. Hutter-Paier B. Prokesch M. Windisch M. Jagla W. Schlenzig D. Lindner C. Rudolph T. Reuter G. Cynis H. Montag D. Demuth H.U. Rossner S. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 1106-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) have shown that oral application of a QC inhibitor, PBD150, in transgenic mouse models and Drosophila model of Alzheimer disease resulted in significantly reduced depositions of Aβ3(pGlu)-40/42 in brain, which led to a significant improvement of learning and memory in these transgenic animals. PBD150 inhibits human QC with a Ki value in the low nanomolar range (22Buchholz M. Heiser U. Schilling S. Niestroj A.J. Zunkel K. Demuth H.U. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 664-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This inhibitor was developed by applying a ligand-based optimization approach starting from imidazole. More recently, the potency of the inhibitor was further improved by an order of magnitude by the addition of a methyl group to its imidazole ring (23Buchholz M. Hamann A. Aust S. Brandt W. Böhme L. Hoffmann T. Schilling S. Demuth H.U. Heiser U. J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 7069-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, although the crystal structure of human QC is now available (Protein Data Bank code 2AFM) (4Huang K.F. Liu Y.L. Cheng W.J. Ko T.P. Wang A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13117-13122Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the detailed interaction mechanism between human QC and PBD150 remains to be elucidated to optimize the enzyme-inhibitor interactions. In addition to the pathological role in brain tissues, a significantly increased gene (QPCT) expression of QC was reported in the cancer cells of melanoma (24Gillis J.S. J. Transl. Med. 2006; 4: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The elevated QC level was believed to interfere with the vaccine treatments of melanoma because vaccines using peptides that have glutaminyl or glutamyl residue at their N terminus might be interrupted by QCs in the tumor-destructive process. Moreover, the increased gene expression of QC was also reported in the peripheral blood monocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (15Batliwalla F.M. Baechler E.C. Xiao X. Li W. Balasubramanian S. Khalili H. Damle A. Ortmann W.A. Perrone A. Kantor A.B. Gulko P.S. Kern M. Furie R. Behrens T.W. Gregersen P.K. Genes Immun. 2005; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), a disorder characterized by chronic inflammation and destruction of bone and cartilage in diarthrodial joints. The increased QC activity in monocytes presumably promotes the maturation of some pGlu-modified chemokines, such as monocyte chemoattractant proteins, which in turn enhance the activation and migration of monocytes, thus accelerating the progression of the inflammatory disease. Therefore, QC inhibitors may also be used for suppressing inflammation as well as increasing the effectiveness of melanoma vaccines. Apart from the currently well studied human QC that is encoded by the gene QPCT located at chromosome 2p22.2, an isoform of the enzyme was recently identified, encoded by the QPCTL gene that maps to chromosome 19q13.32 (25Cynis H. Rahfeld J.U. Stephan A. Kehlen A. Koch B. Wermann M. Demuth H.U. Schilling S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 966-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Stephan A. Wermann M. von Bohlen A. Koch B. Cynis H. Demuth H.U. Schilling S. FEBS J. 2009; 276: 6522-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The first one possesses an N-terminal secretion signal and is thus believed to be a secretory QC (sQC); in contrast, the latter one carries an N-terminal signal anchor and has been demonstrated to be a Golgi-resident QC (gQC). Except for the different N-terminal signal peptides, these two QCs have similarly sized (∼330 residues) catalytic domains with a sequence identity of ∼45% between them. A tissue distribution analysis in a mouse model revealed that both QCs are ubiquitously expressed (25Cynis H. Rahfeld J.U. Stephan A. Kehlen A. Koch B. Wermann M. Demuth H.U. Schilling S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 966-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the expression of gQC showed no significant difference between different organs, whereas the expression of sQC was higher in neuronal tissues. Another notable difference between these two QCs is that gQC has 2–15-fold weaker QC activities on several synthetic substrates when compared with the activities of sQC (25Cynis H. Rahfeld J.U. Stephan A. Kehlen A. Koch B. Wermann M. Demuth H.U. Schilling S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 966-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that these two QCs have distinct active site structures and different sensitivities toward QC inhibitors. To gain insights into the molecular properties of the Golgi-resident QC, we describe here the atomic resolution (1.13 and 1.05 Å) crystal structures of the Golgi-luminal catalytic domain of human gQC. The structures reveal a relatively wide open and negatively charged active site when compared with the reported structure of sQC. We also determined the structures of gQC-PBD150 and sQC-PBD150, revealing a large loop movement in the active site of gQC upon inhibitor binding. To further compare the inhibitor binding modes between gQC and sQC, we also solved the high-resolution structures of gQC in complex with the inhibitors N-ω-acetylhistamine and 1-benzylimidazole because the structures of sQC in complex with these two inhibitors are available (4Huang K.F.

Lastly, we have analyzed the inhibition effects of these inhibitors on gQC and sQC to confirm our observations on the inhibitor-bound QC structures. Chemicals were purchased as follows: l-glutaminyl 2-naphthylamide from Bachem (Weil am Rhein, Germany); 2-naphthylamide, N-ω-acetylhistamine, and cacodylate from Sigma-Aldrich; and 1-benzylimidazole from Fluka (St. Louis, MO). Human pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase I was prepared as described previously (5Huang K.F. Wang Y.R. Chang E.C. Chou T.L. Wang A.H. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The QC inhibitor PBD150 was chemically synthesized according to a previous report (22Buchholz M. Heiser U. Schilling S. Niestroj A.J. Zunkel K. Demuth H.U. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 664-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of analytical or HPLC grade. The DNA with sequence coding for the Golgi-luminal region (Ser53–Leu382) of human gQC (nucleotide entry: NP_060129) was synthesized and then inserted into a thioredoxin fusion expression vector as described previously via HindIII and XhoI cloning sites (27Huang K.F. Liu Y.L. Wang A.H. Protein. Expr. Purif. 2005; 43: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The resulting construct contained a thioredoxin fusion protein, two His6 tags, and a Factor Xa cleavage site upstream of the gQC coding region. The vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus-RIL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The bacteria were grown in Terrific Broth containing ampicillin (70 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) at 37 °C until the cell density reached an A600 of 0.8–0.9. The cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16–20 h at 20 °C. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation (8983 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) followed by freezing at −80 °C. Frozen bacterial pellets were resuspended in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 150 mm NaCl), and the cells were lysed using a cell disruptor (Constant Systems, Kennesaw, GA). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (104,630 × g for 60 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Amersham Biosciences) column preequilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.8). The column was washed with the same buffer, and the bound materials were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–100% buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.8). The fractions for thioredoxin fusion gQC were pooled and then digested with Factor Xa (0.3 units/ml) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). To reduce the interference from imidazole in the protein solution during Factor Xa digestion, the digestion reaction was carried out in a dialysis bag, and the imidazole was removed by dialysis against buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.8) at 25 °C for 16–20 h. Subsequently, because gQC has relatively high histidine content (4.5%), the cleaved gQC products were isolated from the digest by a second nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column preequilibrated with buffer C. The bound gQCs were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–100% buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.8). The proteins were concentrated and further desalted by a Sephacryl S-100 column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 5% glycerol). The purified gQCs were shown to be homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. The expression and purification of sQC was according to a previous protocol (27Huang K.F. Liu Y.L. Wang A.H. Protein. Expr. Purif. 2005; 43: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mutant W207F of sQC was constructed on the basis of the protocol of the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The QC activity of recombinant gQC was evaluated at 25 °C using the fluorescent substrate l-glutaminyl 2-naphthylamide (Gln-βNA). The 100-μl reaction mixture contained 250 μm fluorogenic substrate, ∼0.2 units of human pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase I (1 unit is defined as the amount hydrolyzing 1 μmol of pGlu-βNA per minute under the same condition), and an appropriately diluted aliquot of recombinant gQC in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 5% glycerol, pH 8.0. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 320 and 410 nm, respectively. The reaction was initiated by the addition of gQC. Enzymatic activity was determined by the amount of released βNA, calculated using a standard curve for βNA under the same assay condition. The measurements were made using a FluoroLog®-3 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ). For testing the inhibition activities of imidazole derivatives and cacodylate on gQC and sQC, the reaction mixture was the same as described above, except for the addition of the inhibitor compound. The enzyme was first incubated with each of the inhibitors at 25 °C for 5 min, and then the enzyme-inhibitor mixture was added to the reaction mixture to initiate the cyclization reaction. The IC50 values were obtained by fitting the initial reaction rate versus the inhibitor concentrations using the software KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Ki values were calculated according to the equation IC50 = Ki (1 + S/Km) (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme System. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 100-118Google Scholar), where S is the substrate concentration and Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant. The Km values of the substrate Gln-βNA on gQC and sQC were referenced from previous reports (3Schilling S. Manhart S. Hoffmann T. Ludwig H.H. Wasternack C. Demuth H.U. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Cynis H. Rahfeld J.U. Stephan A. Kehlen A. Koch B. Wermann M. Demuth H.U. Schilling S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 966-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The concentrations of gQC and sQC used were ∼0.1 μm. The purified gQC was concentrated to ∼7 mg/ml using the centrifugal filter Ultracel® 10 K (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The initial crystallization screening of ∼900 conditions was achieved by the Core Facility for Protein Production and X-Ray Structural Analysis in Academia Sinica (Taipei, Taiwan). The crystals were grown at 20 °C by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. Finally, two crystallization conditions were selected, i.e. (i) 30% (v/v) PEG 200, 5% (w/v) PEG 3000, and 0.1 m Mes, pH 6.0, and (ii) 50% (v/v) PEG 200, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 6.5, because the pH values are close to the physiological condition of Golgi apparatus. The purified gQC was mixed with an equal volume of the crystallization solution, and rod-like crystals with dimensions reaching 0.1 × 0.08 × 0.3 mm appeared within 6–10 days (supplemental Fig. S1C). X-ray-diffraction experiments were performed at the beamlines 13B1 and 13C1 of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). Because of the presence of high concentration PEGs in the crystallization solutions, additional cryoprotectants were not required for the crystals. All diffraction data were processed and scaled with the HKL2000 package (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The data collection statistics are listed in Table 1. The space group of the crystals is P212121, with typical unit cells of a = 53 Å, b = 69 Å, and c = 77 Å and a solvent content of ∼35%, in which an asymmetric unit comprises one gQC molecule. For the structures of gQC-inhibitor complexes, the crystals obtained from the pH 6.0 condition were soaked in the mother liquor added with 5 mm inhibitor at 20 °C for 3–5 days.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData collectionCrystalgQC-pH 6.0gQC-pH 6.5gQC-PBD150gQC-Acet.gQC-Benz.sQC-PBD150sQC-W207FSpace groupP212121P212121P212121P212121P212121R3R32Resolution (Å)30-1.1330-1.0530-1.4030-1.1330-1.1250-1.9550-1.95Cell dimensions (Å)a53.253.153.453.353.6155.8118.8b68.668.569.968.669.2155.8118.8c77.477.377.477.477.480.5332.1Total observations1,412,060905,192406,6371,380,721574,803169,715349,893Unique reflections104,166127,16453,439105,259107,67653,12665,863Redundancy13.6 (9.7)aValues in parentheses correspond to highest resolution shell.7.1 (7.1)7.6 (7.6)13.1 (7.4)5.3 (2.9)3.2 (3.1)5.3 (5.4)Completeness (%)97.9 (91.0)96.4 (96.7)92.3 (100.0)98.7 (92.2)96.9 (91.0)99.1 (95.1)99.7 (99.8)I/σ(I)78.1 (14.5)37.4 (3.5)36.9 (3.3)62.1 (4.4)35.2 (2.2)17.6 (2.3)40.3 (3.1)Rmerge (%)5.4 (18.5)8.3 (59.4)6.3 (52.8)6.3 (29.2)5.3 (41.6)7.5 (49.2)4.7 (49.1)No. of molecules in an ASU1111122RefinementResolution (Å)30-1.1330-1.0530-1.4030-1.1330-1.1230-1.9530-1.95Reflections (>0 σ(F)), working/test93,667/5203114,172/640347,869/267894,677/524496,642/539347,256/267959,162/3335Rfactor/Rfree0.126/0.1530.138/0.1580.157/0.2070.131/0.1610.150/0.1810.181/0.2390.143/0.190r.m.s. deviation bond lengths (Å)/ angles (°)0.027/2.140.027/2.130.024/2.040.026/2.160.028/2.270.021/1.860.029/1.90Average B-factor (Å2)/no. of atomsProtein10.8/246012.6/247414.0/244413.1/247413.0/244440.2/522235.5/5216Inhibitor/ligand9.1/515.4/2214.6/1111.8/1229.1/44Zinc ion5.8/16.7/18.6/17.7/16.9/125.8/228.5/2Water26.6/37427.9/36230.1/40429.3/44828.5/46348.2/28445.3/507Ramachandran plot (%)Most favored91.591.592.691.291.988.290.3Additionally allowed8.58.57.08.87.711.89.5Generously allowed000.400.400.2Disallowed0000000PDB ID code3PB43PB63PB73PB83PB93PBB3PBEa Values in parentheses correspond to highest resolution shell. Open table in a new tab Regarding the sQC mutant W207F, the purified protein (∼8 mg/ml) was mixed with an equal volume of the crystallization buffer (1.7 m (NH4)2SO4, 4% (v/v) dioxane, and 100 mm Mes, pH 6.5) and crystallized at 25 °C by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. For the structure of the sQC-PBD150 complex, 2 μl of wild-type sQC (∼10 mg/ml) was mixed with 0.5 μl of PBD150 (5 mm) and 2 μl crystallization buffer (the same as for W207F) and then crystallized as described above. Subsequent cryoprotectant preparation and x-ray data collection were referenced from a previous report (4Huang K.F. Liu Y.L. Cheng W.J. Ko T.P. Wang A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13117-13122Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of gQC was solved by the sulfur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing method using 1.13 Å resolution data collected at the wavelength of 1.0 Å (see Table 1). The positions and occupancies of the six sulfur atoms in gQC were determined with SHELX C/D/E (30Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80764) Google Scholar). The initial phases were calculated with Phaser (31McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14567) Google Scholar), and the phases were improved by density modification with DM (32Cowtan K.D. Zhang K.Y. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 245-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). An initial ∼86% model was automatically traced into the electron density map with ARP/wARP (33Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar), and the remaining model was manually built with O and Coot (34Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar, 35Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar). The resulting model was subjected to rigid-body refinement, simulated annealing, energy minimization, and B-factor refinement with CNS (36Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Throughout the refinements, a random selection for 5% of the data was set aside as a free data set, and the model was refined against the remaining data with F > 0 as a working data set. The parameters for ideal protein geometry of Engh and Huber (37Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) were used during refinements. Subsequently, several rounds of model building with Coot and refinement with Refmac5 (38Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) were performed to improve the quality and completeness of the structure. The well ordered water molecules and one zinc ion were located with Coot. The refinement converged on a final Rfactor/Rfree of 0.126/0.153 at 30–1.13 Å resolution range. The structures of gQC at pH 6.5 and gQC-inhibitor complexes were determined by the molecular replacement method with Molrep (39Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) using the refined gQC structure as the search model. The structures of sQC mutant and sQC-PBD150 complex were also solved by the molecular replacement method using the wild-type sQC (Protein Data Bank code 2AFM) as the search model. These structures were refined as described above, and the stereochemical quality of the refined structures was checked with Procheck (40Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The final refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. The molecular figures were produced with PyMOL (46DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). The Golgi-luminal region (Ser53–Leu382) of human gQC, which corresponds to the catalytic domain of the enzyme (Fig. 1), was overexpressed in E. coli cells and purified to near homogeneity. Purified gQC showed an ∼3-fold weaker QC activity on the substrate l-glutaminyl 2-naphthylamide when compared with the activity of sQC (supplemental Fig. S1A), consistent with the previous results (25Cynis H. Rahfeld J.U. Stephan A. Kehlen A. Koch B. Wermann M. Demuth H.U. Schilling S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 966-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme revealed CD spectra typical of an α/β-protein (supplemental Fig. S1B), similar to the CD curve for sQC, confirming that the recombinant gQC was correctly folded. The gQC crystals grown at the physiological pH conditions of Golgi apparatus were selected for structure determination (supplemental Fig. S1C). The crystal structure of human gQC was solved by the sulfur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing method due to the six sulfur atoms of the enzyme. Using x-ray data from the crystals grown at pH 6.0 (Table 1), the six sulfur atom sites were successfully located with an average occupancy of 0.33. The structure was solved and refined to 1.13 Å resolution with the Rfactor/Rfree values being 0.126/0.153. Other gQC structures have also been determined and refined to high resolutions on the basis of the refined structure. In general, the gQC structur"
https://openalex.org/W1974205861,"Neospora caninum is an intracellular protozoan parasite which is a major cause of abortion in cattle worldwide. It forms persistent infections which recrudesce during pregnancy leading to foetal infection and in a proportion of cases, abortion. The mechanisms underlying abortion are not understood. In this study, recrudescence of a persistent infection in eight naturally infected cows occurred between 20 and 33 weeks of gestation. Animals were killed at the time of recrudescence and parasites were detected in the placentae and foetuses. An active maternal immune response consisting of an infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and a 46-49 fold increase in interferon-γ and interleukin-4 mRNA was detected. Other cytokines, notably interleukin-12 p40, interleukin-10 and tumour necrosis factor-α were also significantly increased and Major Histocompatibility Class II antigen was expressed on maternal and foetal epithelial and stromal fibroblastoid cells. Significantly, despite the presence of an active maternal immune response in the placenta, all the foetuses were alive at the time of maternal euthanasia. There was evidence of parasites within foetal tissues; their distribution was restricted to the central nervous system and skeletal muscle and their presence was associated with tissue necrosis and a non-suppurative inflammatory response involving lymphocytes and macrophages, irrespective of the gestational age of the foetus. Whilst an active maternal immune response to a pathogen in the placenta is generally considered to be damaging to the foetal trophoblast, our findings suggest that the presence of a parasite-induced maternal immune response in the placenta is not detrimental to foetal survival but may contribute to the control of placental parasitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1999979220,"Neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) proteins transduce Ca2+ signals and are highly conserved from yeast to humans. We determined NMR structures of the NCS-1 homolog from fission yeast (Ncs1), which activates a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase. Ncs1 contains an α-NH2-linked myristoyl group on a long N-terminal arm and four EF-hand motifs, three of which bind Ca2+, assembled into a compact structure. In Ca2+-free Ncs1, the N-terminal arm positions the fatty acyl chain inside a cavity near the C terminus. The C14 end of the myristate is surrounded by residues in the protein core, whereas its amide-linked (C1) end is flanked by residues at the protein surface. In Ca2+-bound Ncs1, the myristoyl group is extruded (Ca2+-myristoyl switch), exposing a prominent patch of hydrophobic residues that specifically contact phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase. The location of the buried myristate and structure of Ca2+-free Ncs1 are quite different from those in other NCS proteins. Thus, a unique remodeling of each NCS protein by its myristoyl group, and Ca2+-dependent unmasking of different residues, may explain how each family member recognizes distinct target proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1990460679,"Plectin belongs to the plakin family of cytoskeletal crosslinkers, which is part of the spectrin superfamily. Plakins contain an N-terminal conserved region, the plakin domain, which is formed by an array of spectrin repeats (SR) and a Src-homology 3 (SH3), and harbors binding sites for junctional proteins. We have combined x-ray crystallography and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to elucidate the structure of the central region of the plakin domain of plectin, which corresponds to the SR3, SR4, SR5, and SH3 domains. The crystal structures of the SR3-SR4 and SR4-SR5-SH3 fragments were determined to 2.2 and 2.95 Å resolution, respectively. The SH3 of plectin presents major alterations as compared with canonical Pro-rich binding SH3 domains, suggesting that plectin does not recognize Pro-rich motifs. In addition, the SH3 binding site is partially occluded by an intramolecular contact with the SR4. Residues of this pseudo-binding site and the SR4/SH3 interface are conserved within the plakin family, suggesting that the structure of this part of the plectin molecule is similar to that of other plakins. We have created a model for the SR3-SR4-SR5-SH3 region, which agrees well with SAXS data in solution. The three SRs form a semi-flexible rod that is not altered by the presence of the SH3 domain, and it is similar to those found in spectrins. The flexibility of the plakin domain, in analogy with spectrins, might contribute to the role of plakins in maintaining the stability of tissues subject to mechanical stress.

Plakins are a family of high molecular weight proteins that interconnect elements of the cytoskeleton and tether them to membrane-associated structures; hence, they are also known as cytolinkers (1Jefferson J.J.

Plakins are also present in invertebrates; Drosophila melanogaster has a single plakin gene named shortstop (also know as kakapo) that encodes at least two protein forms, Shot I and Shot II. Similarly, the only plakin gene in Caenorhabditis elegans, vab-10, encodes two variants VAB-10A and VAB-10B. Plectin is a highly versatile plakin that associates with intermediate filaments (3Foisner R. Leichtfried F.E. Herrmann H. Small J.V. Lawson D. Wiche G. J.

Plectin also connects intermediate filaments to membrane-associated complexes. In stratified epithelia such as the skin, plectin is localized at the hemidesmosomes, which are junctional complexes that link the intermediate filaments to the basement membrane, and links the integrin α6β4 and the bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 (BPAG2, also known as type XVII collagen or BP180) to the cytokeratins (7de Pereda J.M.

Other epithelial plakins such as BPAG1e/n, desmoplakin, periplakin, and envoplakin have the same structure. Near the N terminus plectin contains an actin binding domain (ABD) built up of a tandem pair of calponin homology domains (CH1 and CH2), similar to the ABDs present in dystrophin and other members of the spectrin superfamily. The ABD binds to the first pair of fibronectin type III repeats of the integrin β4 subunit via the CH1 domain (18de Pereda J.M. Lillo M.P. Sonnenberg A.

Adjacent to the ABD extends a ∼1000 residue long region named the plakin domain that is conserved in all plakins, except in epiplakin. The plakin domain of plectin and other plakins contain protein-protein interaction sites and they are important for the localization of plakins at junctional complexes. In plectin this region harbors binding sites for the integrin β4 subunit (24Koster J. van Wilpe S. Kuikman I. Litjens S.H. Sonnenberg A. Mol. Biol.

Commun. 2002; 296: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The central region consists of a coiled-coil rod domain that acts as a structural spacer of the protein-protein binding sites located in the N- and C-terminal regions and mediates homo-dimerization of plectin. Finally, the C-terminal region contains six plakin repeat domains and harbors binding sites for intermediate filaments. Initial analysis of the sequence of the plakin domain suggested that this region contains multiple α-helical bundles (27Virata M.L. Wagner R.M. Parry D.A. Green K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), some of which were later identified as spectrin repeats (SR) (28Baines A.J. Cell Mol. Biol. Lett. 2003; 8: 195-214PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of SRs in the plakin domain was confirmed by the crystal structures of two di-repeat fragments of BPAG1 (29Jefferson J.J. Ciatto C. Shapiro L. Liem R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 244-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and plectin (30Sonnenberg A. Rojas A.M. de Pereda J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1379-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The SR-fold (∼100-residues long) consists of three α-helices connected by short loops that pack in a left-handed helical bundle with up-down-up topology (31Pascual J. Pfuhl M. Rivas G. Pastore A. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Pascual J. Pfuhl M. Walther D. Saraste M. Nilges M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The α-helices show a heptad pattern in which positions a and d are occupied by hydrophobic residues that pack at the core of the bundle. Adjacent SRs in the structures of BPAG1, plectin, and those of other pairs of SRs are connected by a helical linker in which the third α-helix (C) of the N-terminal repeat and the first α-helix (A) of the C-terminal SR are fused into a single helix. Thus, arrays of multiple SRs form rod-like structures, as it was illustrated by the crystal structure of a tetra-repeat rod of α-actinin (33Ylänne J. Scheffzek K. Young P. Saraste M. Structure. 2001; 9: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have previously identified eight canonical SRs in the sequence of the plakin domain of plectin (SR1 to SR5 and SR7 to SR9), and an additional shorter SR-like domain (SR6) (Fig. 1A) (30Sonnenberg A. Rojas A.M. de Pereda J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1379-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The available crystal structures of plectin and BPAG1 correspond to the SR1-SR2 and SR3-SR4, respectively. The SR2 and SR3 of plectin are connected by a ∼20-residues long linker predicted to be non-helical, while repeats SR3 to SR9 occur contiguous in the plectin sequence as observed in the structure of the SR3-SR4 pair of BPAG1 (29Jefferson J.J. Ciatto C. Shapiro L. Liem R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 244-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition to the SRs, there is a Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain toward the middle of the plakin domain (29Jefferson J.J. Ciatto C. Shapiro L. Liem R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 244-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); this is of interest because SH3 domains mediate protein-protein interactions, frequently binding to Pro-rich sequences (34Kaneko T. Li L. Li S.S. Front Biosci. 2008; 13: 4938-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain is inserted in the central repeat, SR5, and this arrangement is almost identical to that of α-spectrin in which there is an SH3 within the central SR; for which the relative organization of the SH3 and the SRs is unknown. Overall, the structural organization of the plakin domain is highly similar to that of α- and β-spectrins and other members of the spectrin superfamily, both regarding the repertoire of modules (ABD, SR, and SH3) and their arrangement. Despite recent advances in the characterization of the structure and function of the plakin domain, important issues remained unanswered. Does the plakin domain adopt a rod-like structure formed by juxtaposed SRs similar to that of spectrins and related proteins? If so, does the insertion of the SH3 domain alter the SR array? Is the structure of the SH3 domain compatible with ligand binding and is its binding site accessible? To address these questions, we have combined x-ray crystallography and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to elucidate the structure of the central region of the plakin domain of plectin, which includes the SR3, SR4, SR5, and the SH3; a region that is involved in protein-protein interactions. Our results have implications for the contribution of the plakin domain of plectin and other plakins to the stability of junctional complexes subject to mechanical forces. The cDNA sequences coding for residues 543–748, 640–918, and 543–918 of human plectin (numbering correspond to the plectin 1c variant, UniprotKB accession number Q15149-2) were cloned into a modified version of the pET15b vector (35Alonso-García N. Inglés-Prieto A. Sonnenberg A. De Pereda J.M. Acta. Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2009; 65: 858-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and were purified by nickel-chelating affinity chromatography as described (22García-Alvarez B. Bobkov A. Sonnenberg A. de Pereda J.M. Structure. 2003; 11: 615-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The His tag present at the N terminus of the fusion proteins was cleaved by digestion with tobacco etch virus protease, and was removed by a second nickel-affinity chromatography. Crystals of SR3-SR4 (residues 543–748) were grown at 4 °C using vapor diffusion methods by mixing a protein solution at 31 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT with an equal volume of mother liquor consisting of 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), 17% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, and 8% (v/v) isopropanol. Prior to data collection, crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), 18% (w/v) PEG 4000, and 6% (v/v) isopropanol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol that was vitrified by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 100 K using a Microstar-H rotating anode x-ray generator (Bruker AXS) and a mar345dtb detector (Marresearch GmbH). Diffraction intensities were indexed and integrated with XDS and reduced with XSCALE (36Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). Crystals belong to space group P21212 and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit (∼54% solvent content) (Table 1). A mixed search model for molecular replacement (37Schwarzenbacher R. Godzik A. Grzechnik S.K. Jaroszewski L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) was built by homology modeling using as template the crystal structure of the equivalent region of BPAG1 (PDB code 2IAK)(29Jefferson J.J. Ciatto C. Shapiro L. Liem R.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 244-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that corresponds to ∼85% of the residues of the plectin fragment and have ∼65% sequence identity. Our data were then phased by molecular replacement using the program PHASER (38McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (13901) Google Scholar) within the CCP4 suite (39Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Refinement was done against data to 2.22 Å resolution using phenix.refine (40Afonine P.V. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. CCP4 Newsl. 2005; 42 (contribution 8)Google Scholar), alternated with manual model building using COOT (41Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar). This partial structure was completed based on additional electron density observed in the 2mFo−DFc maps. Simulated annealing was used in the initial stages of refinement, while gradient-driven positional refinement, individual isotropic B-factor restrained refinement and TLS refinement (42Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) were used at later stages. Three TLS groups identified by using the TLS Motion Determination server (43Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) were refined in each molecule. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were not included during refinement. Solvent molecules were built in peaks over 3σ of mfobs−Dfcalc maps and 1σ of 2mfobs−Dfcalc maps when reasonable H-bonding pattern was observed. Two elongated electron densities not belonging to the protein chains were modeled as two PEG fragments, ethylene glycol and di(hydroxyethyl)ether, respectively. The final model contains residues 545–746 of molecule A, residues 543–745 of the molecule B, 210 water molecules and two PEG fragments. The model has excellent geometry with 99.5% of the main chain torsion angles located in the favored regions of the Ramachandran plot.TABLE 1Summary of crystallographic analysisData CollectionProteinSR3-SR4 (543–748)SR4-SR5-SH3 (640–918)Data setNativeNative1 mm EMTSSpace groupP21212P212121P212121Cell dimensionsa = 97.4 Åa = 72.7 Åa = 72.2 Åb = 119.4 Åb = 108.5 Åb = 107.9 Åc = 44.6 Åc = 112.1 Åc = 113.0 ÅWavelength (Å)1.54181.54181.5418Resolution (Å)2.22 (2.30-2.22)aNumbers in parenthesis correspond to the outer resolution shell.2.95 (3.05-2.95)aNumbers in parenthesis correspond to the outer resolution shell.3.40 (3.53-3.40)aNumbers in parenthesis correspond to the outer resolution shell.Unique reflections260661805122352bKeeping Bijvoet pairs separate.Redundancy7.0 (5.9)aNumbers in parenthesis correspond to the outer resolution shell.14.3 (14.5)aNumbers in parenthesis correspond to the outer resolution shell.7.8 (7.7)aNumbers in parenthesis correspond to the outer resolution shell.Completeness (%)98.4 (92.1)aNumbers in parenthesis correspond to the outer resolution shell.93.6 (85.5)aNumbers in parenthesis correspond to the outer resolution shell.95.1 (98.6)aNumbers in parenthesis correspond to the outer resolution shell.RmeascRmeas is the multiplicity independent R factor as described by Diederichs and Karplus (66).

Open table in a new tab Crystals of the SR4-SR5-SH3 protein (residues 640–918) were grown at 4 °C using vapor diffusion methods by mixing a protein solution at 15 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT with an equal volume of mother liquor consisting of 0.1 m imidazole (pH 7.2), 0.2 m Ca acetate, 9% (w/v) PEG 8000, and 2 mm DTT. After crystals were grown, the drop containing the crystals was equilibrated for ∼36 h against a solution with twice the concentration of all the components in the initial crystallization solution. Before data collection, the crystal was transferred to 0.2 m imidazole (pH 7.2), 0.4 m calcium acetate, 18% (w/v) PEG 8000, 4 mm DTT, and increasing concentrations of glycerol up to 20%. Crystals for heavy atom derivatization were grown as for native crystals, but using 0.1 m imidazole (pH 7.6), 0.2 m calcium acetate, 10% (w/v) PEG 8000, and 2 mm DTT as crystallization solution. Crystals were soaked for 3.5 h in 0.1 m imidazole (pH 7.6), 0.2 m calcium acetate, 12% (w/v) PEG 8000, 1 mm ethylmercurithiosalicylate (EMTS). Excess of EMTS was removed during the equilibration in cryoprotectant solutions consisting of 0.1 m imidazole (pH 7.6), 0.2 m calcium acetate, 12% (w/v) PEG 8000, and 5% to 20% glycerol. Data of the native and EMTS-soaked crystals were collected and processed as for the SR3-SR4 crystals. SR4-SR5-SH3 crystals belong to the space group P212121. The asymmetric unit contains two plectin molecules (∼64% solvent content) that are related by a non-crystallographic translation about 1/2 along axis c (0.00 0.00 0.46), which was evident as a peak in the native Patterson map. Phases were obtained by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) using the native and mercurial datasets. Calculation of approximate substructure amplitudes, heavy atom substructure determination, and initial phase calculations were done with ShelxC/D/E (44Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar) and the HKL2MAP graphical interface (45Pape T. Schneider T.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 843-844Crossref Google Scholar). Phase probability distributions from the top four Hg-sites found by Shelx, were further refined with SHARP (46Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), and allowed for the identification of one additional minor Hg site. Phase improvement and extension with Solomon (47Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar) and DM (48Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) allowed the calculation of an interpretable electron density map (supplemental Fig. S1). Two copies of the SR4 from the SR3-SR4 structure were located by phased-molecular replacement using MOLREP (49Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4098) Google Scholar); in addition, α-helices corresponding to the SR5 were built and two copies of a mixed model (37Schwarzenbacher R. Godzik A. Grzechnik S.K. Jaroszewski L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) of the SH3 domain based on the crystal structure of the SH3 of α-spectrin (PDB code 2PQH) were docked into the SIRAS map. Refinement was done with phenix.refine against native data to 2.95 Å. At early stages, refinement included simulated annealing, while individual positional and grouped B-factor (two groups per residue) refinement combined with the refinement of five TLS groups in each plectin molecule was done at later stages. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints and main-chain H-bond distance restraints were used during refinement. A map calculated using the anomalous differences of the native dataset and the SIRAS phases has the two strongest peaks near Gln-792 in each of the molecules in the asymmetric unit (supplemental Fig. S2A) and the anomalous signal at theses positions was higher than at any of the sulfur atoms of the protein. Based on the environment (near the carbonyls of Asp-789 and Gln-792) these peaks were modeled as Ca2+ ions whose B-factors were refined anisotropically. The final model has good geometry (Table 1) and contains residues 642–915 in both chains, with the exception of residues 871–873 in molecule A and 830–832 in molecule B, for which no clear electron density was observed. Identification of residue pairs that could form disulfide bonds was done with the program SSBOND (50Hazes B. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Analysis of protein motions by pair-wise comparison of conformers was done with the program DynDom (51Hayward S. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Molecular figures were prepared using PyMOL (52DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA, U.S.A2002Google Scholar). Sulfhydryl groups were titrated under denaturing conditions with 5,5′-dithio-nis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as described (22García-Alvarez B.

SAXS measurements were performed at the cSAXS beamline at the Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland). The energy of the x-ray beam was adjusted to 12 KeV (λ = 1.0 Å) and the distance from the sample to the detector (PILATUS 2 m, Dectris Ltd.) was 2.15 meters, covering a scattering vector range (q = 4πsinθ/λ) from 0.015 to 0.5 Å−1, as determined by the silver behenate scattering profile. The buffers used for the last gel filtration step of the protein purifications, containing 5% (v/v) glycerol and 2.5 mm DTT, and protein samples were measured consecutively in the same borosilicate capillary (Ø 1 mm, Hilgenberg GmbH), using an in house designed thermostatized copper holder.

https://openalex.org/W2088557329,"Background High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is a major endogenous danger signal that triggers inflammation and immunity during septic and aseptic stresses. HMGB1 recently emerged as a key soluble factor in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases, but nothing is known of its behaviour during herpesvirus infection. We therefore investigated the dynamics and biological effects of HMGB1 during HSV-2 infection of epithelial HEC-1 cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Despite a transcriptional shutdown of HMGB1 gene expression during infection, the intracellular pool of HMGB1 protein remained unaffected, indicating its remarkable stability. However, the dynamics of HMGB1 was deeply modified in infected cells. Whereas viral multiplication was concomitant with apoptosis and HMGB1 retention on chromatin, a subsequent release of HMGB1 was observed in response to HSV-2 mediated necrosis. Importantly, extracellular HMGB1 was biologically active. Indeed, HMGB1-containing supernatants from HSV-2 infected cells induced the migration of fibroblasts from murine or human origin, and reactivated HIV-1 from latently infected T lymphocytes. These effects were specifically linked to HMGB1 since they were blocked by glycyrrhizin or by a neutralizing anti-HMGB1 antibody, and were mediated through TLR2 and the receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE). Finally, we show that genital HSV-2 active infections also promote HMGB1 release in vivo, strengthening the clinical relevance of our experimental data. Conclusions These observations target HMGB1 as an important actor during HSV-2 genital infection, notably in the setting of HSV-HIV co-infection."
https://openalex.org/W1967328283,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A) is an autosomal dominant axonal form of peripheral neuropathy caused by mutations in the mitofusin 2 gene (MFN2), which encodes a mitochon-drial outer membrane protein that promotes mito-chondrial fusion. Emerging evidence also points to a role of MFN2 in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism. To examine whether mitochondrial dysfunction is a feature of CMT2A, we used a transgenic mouse model expressing in neurons a mutated R94Q form of human MFN2 shown to induce a CMT2A phenotype. Oxygraphic and enzymatic measurements both revealed a combined defect of mitochondrial complexes II and V (40 and 30% decrease, respectively) in the brain of Tg-R94 mice, leading to a drastic decrease of ATP synthesis. These deficiencies were reversed by the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel (mKATP) inhibitor 5-hydroxyde-canoate. Conversely, in controls and wild-type human MFN2 mice, the mKATP activator diazoxide mimicked the deficiency observed with the R94Q mutation. The physical links between complexes II and V, previously proposed as part of mKATP, were reinforced in Tg-R94Q mice. Our results show that the R94Q MFN2 mutation induces a combined defect of complexes II and V linked to the opening of mKATP, which could participate in the pathophysiology of the disease.—Guillet, V., Gueguen, N., Cartoni, R., Chevrollier, A., Desquiret, V., Angebault, C., Amati-Bonneau, P., Procaccio, V., Bonneau, D., Martinou, J.-C., Reynier, P.

https://openalex.org/W1970018793,"Although alternative DNA secondary structures (non-B DNA) can induce genomic rearrangements, their associated mutational spectra remain largely unknown. The helicase activity of WRN, which is absent in the human progeroid Werner syndrome, is thought to counteract this genomic instability. We determined non-B DNA-induced mutation frequencies and spectra in human U2OS osteosarcoma cells and assessed the role of WRN in isogenic knockdown (WRN-KD) cells using a supF gene mutation reporter system flanked by triplex- or Z-DNA-forming sequences. Although both non-B DNA and WRN-KD served to increase the mutation frequency, the increase afforded by WRN-KD was independent of DNA structure despite the fact that purified WRN helicase was found to resolve these structures in vitro. In U2OS cells, ∼70% of mutations comprised single-base substitutions, mostly at G·C base-pairs, with the remaining ∼30% being microdeletions. The number of mutations at G·C base-pairs in the context of NGNN/NNCN sequences correlated well with predicted free energies of base stacking and ionization potentials, suggesting a possible origin via oxidation reactions involving electron loss and subsequent electron transfer (hole migration) between neighboring bases. A set of ∼40,000 somatic mutations at G·C base pairs identified in a lung cancer genome exhibited similar correlations, implying that hole migration may also be involved. We conclude that alternative DNA conformations, WRN deficiency and lung tumorigenesis may all serve to increase the mutation rate by promoting, through diverse pathways, oxidation reactions that perturb the electron orbitals of neighboring bases. It follows that such ""hole migration"" is likely to play a much more widespread role in mutagenesis than previously anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W2080844267,"Similar to mechanisms of recruitment of activated leukocytes to inflamed tissues, selectins mediate adhesion and extravasation of circulating cancer cells. Our objective was to determine whether sialyl Lewis X modified core 2 O-glycans (C2-O-sLeX) present on colon and hepatic carcinoma cells promote their adhesion and invasion. We examined membrane expression of C2-O-sLeX, selectin binding, invasion of human colon and hepatic carcinoma cell lines, and mRNA levels of alpha-2,3 fucosyltransferase (FucT-III) and core 2 beta-1,6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT1) genes, necessary for C2-O-sLeX synthesis, by quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR. Synthesis of core 2 branched O-glycans decorated by sLeX is dependent on C2GnT1 function and thus we determined enzyme activity of C2GnT1. The cell lines that expressed C2GnT1 and FucT-III mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR were highly positive for C2-O-sLeX by flow cytometry, and colon carcinoma cells possessed highly active C2GnT1 enzyme. Cells bound avidly to E-selection but not to P- and L-selectin. Gene knock-down of C2GnT1 in colon and hepatic carcinoma cells using short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) resulted in a 40–90% decrease in C2-O-sLeX and a 30–50% decrease in E-selectin binding compared to control cells. Invasion of hepatic and colon carcinoma cells containing C2GnT1 shRNA was significantly reduced compared to control cells in Matrigel assays and C2GnT1 activity was down-regulated in the latter cells. The sLeX epitope was predominantly distributed on core 2 O-glycans on colon and hepatic carcinoma cells. Our findings indicate that C2GnT1 gene expression and the resulting C2-O-sLeX carbohydrates produced mediate the adhesive and invasive behaviors of human carcinomas which may influence their metastatic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2051673591,"Organisms utilize light as energy sources and as signals. Rhodopsins, which have seven transmembrane α-helices with retinal covalently linked to a conserved Lys residue, are found in various organisms as distant in evolution as bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. One of the most notable properties of rhodopsin molecules is the large variation in their absorption spectrum. Sensory rhodopsin I (SRI) and sensory rhodopsin II (SRII) function as photosensors and have similar properties (retinal composition, photocycle, structure, and function) except for their λ(max) (SRI, ∼560 nm; SRII, ∼500 nm). An expression system utilizing Escherichia coli and the high protein stability of a newly found SRI-like protein, SrSRI, enables studies of mutant proteins. To determine the residue contributing to the spectral shift from SRI to SRII, we constructed various SRI mutants, in which individual residues were substituted with the corresponding residues of SRII. Three such mutants of SrSRI showed a large spectral blue-shift (>14 nm) without a large alteration of their retinal composition. Two of them, A136Y and A200T, are newly discovered color tuning residues. In the triple mutant, the λ(max) was 525 nm. The inverse mutation of SRII (F134H/Y139A/T204A) generated a spectral-shifted SRII toward longer wavelengths, although the effect is smaller than in the case of SRI, which is probably due to the lack of anion binding in the SRII mutant. Thus, half of the spectral shift from SRI to SRII could be explained by only those three residues taking into account the effect of Cl(-) binding."

https://openalex.org/W1964035103,"The tolQRAB-pal operon is conserved in Gram-negative genomes. The TolQRA proteins of Escherichia coli form an inner membrane complex in which TolQR uses the proton-motive force to regulate TolA conformation and the in vivo interaction of TolA C-terminal region with the outer membrane Pal lipoprotein.

When required, cells were treated for 20 min with 0.3 mm copper (II) orthophenanthroline (CuoP; Sigma) prior to blocking with NEM. After centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer in the presence or absence of the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol. To ensure oxidized environmental conditions at the periplasmic and cytoplasmic sides of the TMH, cysteine mutants were also analyzed from membrane preparations; cells were broken by four freeze and thaw cycles, and the suspension was further treated with 2.5 mm NEM. Membranes recovered upon ultracentrifugation were suspended in PBS buffer. Formaldehyde cross-linking was performed as described previously (40Derouiche R. Bénédetti H. Lazzaroni J.C. Lazdunski C. Lloubès R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11078-11084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In vivo cross-linking with ethylene glycol-bis(succinimidylsuccinate) (Pierce), dithiobis(succinimidyl) propionate (Pierce), and dimethyl adipimidate (Pierce) were performed as described previously (41Cascales E. Bernadac A. Gavioli M. Lazzaroni J.C. Lloubes R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and immunodetected with the anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) or the anti-Penta-his (Qiagen) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and secondary antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) and nitroblue tetrazolium (Sigma). For co-immunoprecipitations, cells were treated with formaldehyde and disrupted by sonication. Membranes were recovered by ultracentrifugation (45 min at 90,000 × g) and solubilized in TES buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Samples were diluted 15-fold in TNE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. Solubilized samples were then subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HA mAb coupled to protein G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (22Goemaere E.L. Devert A. Lloubès R. Cascales E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). TolQ8H and TolQ8H-G157C were purified from membrane fractions. Membrane proteins were extracted using 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). TolQ8H was purified by ion metal affinity chromatography using nickel resin (Qiagen) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, buffer supplemented with 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Eluted material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and imidazole was removed by anion exchange chromatography (ResourceQ column, GE Healthcare). Because of the lack of availability of specific anti-sera, the TolQ protein has never been immunodetected using Western blot, precluding any characterization. Interactions involving TolQ have been identified through cross-linking and immunodetection using anti-TolR or anti-TolA polyclonal antibodies (40Derouiche R. Bénédetti H. Lazzaroni J.C. Lazdunski C. Lloubès R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11078-11084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 42Journet L. Rigal A. Lazdunski C. Bénédetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4476-4484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore constructed plasmids pOK-QHA and pQ8R that encode the TolQ protein fused to a C-terminal HA epitope and a histidine tag, respectively. Immunoblot analyzes were performed on cell extracts of strains expressing TolQHA from pOK-QHA or TolQ8H from pQ8R using monoclonal antibodies. We detected a protein of ∼30 kDa, consistent with the predicted TolQ molecular mass. To determine whether the addition of the C-terminal tags affected TolQ function, we checked two phenotypes that correlated with a functional TolQ protein; outer membrane stability was assayed by the level of periplasmic release and of DOC sensitivity, whereas colicin import was assayed by the level of sensitivity to the TolQ-dependent colicins A, E3, and E9. Both constructions (pOK-QHA (co-transformed with the compatible TolR-producing pUC-R plasmid) and pQ8R) restored the outer membrane stability and the colicin susceptibility of tolQR cells to wild-type levels (data not shown). To determine whether the previously described TolQ-TolR interaction might be visualized upon chemical cross-linking, we treated living cells expressing TolQHA with formaldehyde as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two major complexes containing the TolQHA protein were observed, with relative migrations of ∼43 and ∼52 kDa (Fig. 1A). According to their apparent molecular masses, the 43- and 52-kDa complexes correspond to TolQHA-TolR heterodimer and TolQHA homodimer, respectively (Fig. 1A). The composition of the complexes was further validated by the observation that the 43-kDa complex disappeared in cells that do not produce the TolR protein (Fig. 1A) and displayed a shifted mobility in the presence of TolR variants (supplemental Fig. S1). These complexes involve transmembrane or cytoplasmic segments because utilization of the inner membrane-impermeant chemical cross-linkers ethylene glycol-bis(succinimidylsuccinate), dithiobis(succinimidyl) propionate, and dimethyl adipimidate did not allow complex formation (data not shown). All these complexes were not observed when TolQ was expressed instead of TolQHA. Identical experiments in tol-pal mutant strains indicated that none of these complexes contained the TolA, TolB, or Pal subunits (data not shown). Two additional high molecular mass complexes (a, ∼70 kDa; b, ∼100 kDa) were also observed and likely involved TolQ multimers associated with TolR because they disappeared in cells that do not produce TolR (Fig. 1A). To further confirm that TolQ interacts with itself, we purified TolQ8H from n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside-solubilized membranes of Tuner (DE3) cells overproducing TolQ8H from pQ8R. The purified protein was then tested for its ability to form multimers in vitro upon formaldehyde cross-linking and Western blot immunodetections. Results displayed in Fig. 1B showed that TolQ8H dimerizes. This result was further confirmed by co-precipitation experiments using extracts of cells producing both TolQ8H and TolQHA. Immunoprecipitation using anti-HA beads showed that TolQ8H specifically co-purified with TolQHA (Fig. 1C), whereas TolQHA co-purified with TolQ8H on metal affinity beads (data not shown). To gain further insight into TolQ multimerization, we constructed single cysteine variants encompassing the three TolQ TMHs (TMH1, amino-acids 19–37; TMH2, amino acids 138–157; and TMH3, amino acids 169–187) (see the topological model in Fig. 2B). Immunodetection indicated that all the TolQ mutant proteins accumulated at comparable levels. We first carried out a phenotypic analysis of cells expressing these tolQ variants by testing (i) the sensitivity to colicins A and E2 (Tol-dependent) and colicin D (TonB-dependent, used as negative control) and (ii) the outer membrane integrity following bacterial growth on DOC plates. Detailed phenotypic analyses for these 58 single substitutions are presented Table 1 and summarized in Fig. 2. Most cysteine substitutions that conferred tol and discriminative phenotypes gather on one discrete face of TMH1 close to the cytoplasm (Ser28-Ser31-Ile35), two discrete faces of TMH2 (Gly141-Gly144-Gly148 and Tyr139-Leu142-Val146), and also close to the cytoplasm and distribute all along TMH3 (Fig. 2A). The results of this cysteine-scanning study were compared with those of TolQ site-directed mutagenesis, which specifically modified small lateral chains, Pro, and hydrophilic residues (18Goemaere E.L. Cascales E. Lloubès R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1424-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Comparable phenotypes were obtained for substitutions except for some mutations for which the bulk or the charge of the lateral chains differ from that of a cysteine and two substitutions (Gly157 and Glu173; supplemental Fig. S2).TABLE 1Phenotypic analysis of TolQ cysteine mutationsMutationColicin activitiesOM stability (DOC)Complex formationPhenotypeAE2DWT444R−BtolQRR4S−RTMH1L19C444R−BI20C444R−BM21C444R−BL22C444R−BI23C4443−BL24C4443−BI25C4443−BG26C444R−BF27C444R−BS28C4441−CI29C4443−BA30C4443−BS31C3341−CW32C444R−BA33C4443−BI34C4443−BI35C4441−CI36C4443−BQ37C4443−BTMH2P138C4441−CY139C444S−CI140C444R−BG141CRR4S−RL142C4441−CF143C4443−BG144CRR4S−RT145C444R−BV146C3441−CW147C344R−BG148C224S−CI149C4443−BM150C4441−CH151C444R−BA152C4443−BF153C4442−CI154C444R+BA155C3443−BL156C3443−BG157C4443+BTMH3P169C3441−CG170C444R−BI171C2343−BA172C444R−BE173CRR41−RA174C4441−CL175C344S−CI176C444R−BA177C334S−CT178C4441−CA179C444R−BI180C444R−BG181C4441−CL182CRR4S−RF183C4443−BA184C444R−BA185C444R−BI186C3341−CP187C444S−C Open table in a new tab We then tested whether the single cysteine substitutions might induce intermolecular disulfide bonds. Total membrane extracts were treated with the thiol-blocking agent NEM and analyzed using non-reducing SDS-PAGE conditions. Two TolQ cysteine mutants, I154C and G157C, formed homodimers (supplemental Fig. S3). Interestingly, these two residues are present on the same face of TMH2, separated by one helix turn, and close to the periplasmic side. These dimers were not observed in the presence of reducing agent (data not shown). Because the experiments were performed with membrane preparations and could reflect artifactual cysteine oxidization, the experiments were repeated with whole cells producing TolQHA or overproducing TolQ8H that were directly treated by NEM. Identical results to those with membrane preparations were obtained for the TolQHA variant-producing cells (data not shown). The TolQ8H variants that were overexpressed included the residues shown to dimerize (TolQ154C and TolQ157C), the residues flanking the TolQ TMHs, and the TMH2 A155C as control. The results of disulfide bond formation on intact cells overproducing the TolQ8H variants confirmed that TolQ154C and TolQ157C formed homodimers, whereas TolQ155C remained as a monomer (Fig. 3A, upper panel). The addition of the oxidizing agent CuoP on intact (Fig. 3A, lower panel) or disrupted cells (not shown) resulted in an increase of TolQ154C and TolQ157C dimer levels and the apparition of a weak TolQ169C dimer. Coomassie Blue staining of purified TolQ157C further indicated that the dimer accumulated in significant amount even in the a"

In general, small uncharged residues such as alanine and serine are most frequently found at the P3, P1, and P1′ positions of these birnavirus polyprotein cleavage sites. The VP4 protease from birnavirus is a serine endoprotease that utilizes a serine-lysine catalytic dyad mechanism as opposed to the classical serine-histidine-aspartate catalytic triad mechanism (16Ekici O.D.

Besides the unusual feature of utilizing a lysine ϵ-amino group as a general base, these enzymes are also unusual in that their serine Oγ nucleophile attacks the scissile bond from the si-face rather than the re-face as is seen in most serine proteases. TV-1 was first isolated from the sand dwelling marine bivalve mollusk Tellina tenuis (24Hill B.J. Page L.A. Wildlife Diseases. Plenum Press, New York1976: 445-452Google Scholar). Manifestations of the disease include a thin and chalky shell as well as a pale yellow digestive gland. TV-1 VP4 is encoded as part of the 1114-residue long segment A polyprotein. It cleaves after amino acid residue positions 512, 618, and 830 to yield capsid precursor protein pVP2, peptide X, VP4 itself, and ribonucleoprotein VP3 (Fig. 1A) (6Nobiron I. Galloux M. Henry C.

However, the amino acid sequence of TV-1 VP4 is more divergent from the rest of the VP4s and is classified into family S69 instead of family S50 in which the IPNV, infectious bursal disease virus, BSNV, and DXV VP4s have been assigned. The first VP4 structure solved was from BSNV; however, no substrate was bound in its active site (26Feldman A.R. Lee J. Delmas B. Paetzel M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1378-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, the crystal structure of IPNV VP4 revealed an intermolecular (trans) acyl-enzyme complex (27Lee J. Feldman A.R. Delmas B. Paetzel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24928-24937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we report the structure of VP4 from TV-1 at 2.1-Å resolution with the C terminus binding into its own active site forming an intramolecular (cis) acyl-enzyme complex. The DNA region encoding full-length TV-1 VP4 (residue 619–830, Swiss-Prot accession number Q2PBR5) was first amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolab). The forward primer has the sequence 5′-AGGCCCATATGGCCGACAGGCCCATGATC-3′ and the reverse primer has the sequence 5′-CTTGTGAAGGCGGCCGCTCATGCTTGCGCCACGTTCTTTCCGGAGGAGAA-3′. The restriction enzyme-digested PCR product was then cloned into restriction sites NdeI and NotI of plasmid pET28b+. This allowed for the incorporation of an amino-terminal histidine tag when the recombinant protein was expressed. The plasmid was then transformed into NovaBlue cells (Novagen) for plasmid isolation. The sequence of the DNA insert was verified by DNA sequencing. The N terminus of the expressed protein has an extra 21 amino acids (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM) that includes the His6 affinity tag and the linker region. The calculated molecular mass for this construct is 24,745 Da (233 amino acids, calculated isoelectric point, 9.9). Cells for protein overexpression were prepared by transforming the plasmid containing the gene for TV-1 VP4 described above into Escherichia coli strain Tuner (DE3) followed by selection on LB plates with 0.05 mg/ml of kanamycin. For overexpression, a cell pellet from 100 ml of overnight culture grown in LB medium supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml of kanamycin was used to inoculate each liter of M9 minimal medium. Four liters of culture were grown for each batch of protein expressed and purified. After shaking at 37 °C for 8 h, a mixture of L-amino acids (100 mg of lysine, phenylalanine, and threonine; 50 mg of isoleucine, leucine, and valine) and 60 mg of selenomethionine were added to each liter of culture. Each liter of culture was induced with 0.5 ml of 1 m isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside after 15 min. The induced cultures were allowed to grow overnight at 25 °C and were then harvested by centrifugation at 9,110 × g for 7 min. The cell pellet was stored at −80 °C for 15 min to facilitate cell lysis. The frozen cell pellet was re-suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 7 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 units/ml of benzonase, and 0.2 mg/ml of lysozyme) and incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle agitation. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 28,964 × g and the clear supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity column (Qiagen). A step gradient containing 100, 300, and 600 mm imadizole in standard buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT) was used to elute the histidine-tagged VP4. Fractions positive for VP4 were then applied to a 5-ml SP-Sepharose FF cation-exchange column equilibrated with standard buffer and eluted stepwise with 100, 300, and 500 mm NaCl in standard buffer. Fractions positive for VP4 were pooled and loaded onto a size exclusion column (HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-100 HR) equilibrated with crystallization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol). The size exclusion column was connected to a Pharmacia AKTA PrimeTM system that pumped at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Fractions with pure VP4 were pooled and concentrated using a Millipore centrifugal filter (10 kDa cutoff). The concentrated sample was incubated with chymotrypsin overnight at 4 °C and then applied to the same size exclusion column mentioned above. Details of this limited proteolysis procedure are described elsewhere (28Chung I.Y. Paetzel M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2011; 67: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Purified VP4 was concentrated to ∼40 mg/ml for crystallization trials. The crystal used for data collection was obtained using the hanging-drop method at room temperature (∼23 °C). On a coverslip, 1 μl of VP4 was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir reagent and 1 μl of 0.2 m urea as an additive. To aid in crystal nucleation, this drop was seeded with 1 μl of selenomethionine-labeled TV-1 VP4 crystals from an older drop. The drop was allowed to reach vapor equilibrium via incubation over 1 ml of reservoir reagent in a grease-sealed chamber. The optimized reservoir condition was 21% PEG8000, 0.55 m ammonium sulfate. The cryosolution contained 70% of the buffer reservoir and 30% glycerol. The crystal was transferred into the cryosolution, flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen, and then subjected to diffraction analysis. These hexagonal crystals belong to space group P6422, have unit cell dimensions of 59.1 × 59.1 × 208.1 Å with one molecule in the asymmetric unit, a Matthews coefficient of 2.1, and a solvent content of 42.1%. Data collection was carried out at the Canadian Light Source on beam line 08ID-1 at a wavelength of 0.9789 Å with 0.5 degree oscillations and each image was exposed for 5 s. The distance between the crystal and the detector was 350 mm. The diffraction images were indexed and integrated using the program MOSFLM and scaled to 2.1 Å using SCALA (29Collaborative Computing Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19665) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (f′, −7.11; f″, 4.77) using the program AutoSol from the Phenix program suite (30Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W.

Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13708) Google Scholar). The model from AutoSol was 90% complete. The remaining 10% of the molecule was built manually in COOT (34Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (16016) Google Scholar) using a difference density map generated by REFMAC5. Restraints for the acyl-enzyme linkage were prepared using the REFMAC5 library definitions (35Vagin A.A. Steiner R.A. Lebedev A.A. Potterton L. McNicholas S. Long F. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr.

Residue contact and hydrogen bond analysis was performed using the program CONTACT in the CCP4i crystallography software suite (29Collaborative Computing Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The root mean square deviation (r.m.s. deviation) values reported for protein superpositions were calculated using SUPERPOSE (38Maiti R. Van Domselaar G.H. Zhang H. Wishart D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W590-W594Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The secondary structure assignments were performed using STRIDE (39Frishman D. Argos P.

The amino terminus of TV-1 VP4 (residue 619) is defined by its X/VP4 cleavage site and its carboxyl terminus is defined by its VP4/VP3 cleavage site (residue 830) (Fig. 1). We have successfully cloned, expressed, and purified full-length wild-type TV-1 VP4 protease (residue 619–830) with an amino-terminal His6 affinity tag. Limited proteolysis was used to remove disordered amino-terminal residues to promote crystallization. We have crystallized and solved the structure of TV-1 VP4 using single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing methods and refined the structure (residues 637–830) to 2.1-Å resolution (Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsCrystal parametersSpace groupP6422a, b, c (Å)59.1, 59.1, 208.1Data collection statisticsWavelength (Å)0.97893Resolution (Å)52.0-2.1(2.2-2.1)aThe data collection statistics in brackets are the values for the highest resolution shell.Total reflections154,167 (9,938)Unique reflections13,466 (1,841)RmergebRmerge = Σhkl Σi|Ii(hkl) − 〈I(hkl)〉|/ΣhklΣi Ii(hkl), where Ii(hkl) is the intensity of an individual reflection, and 〈I(hkl)〉 is the mean intensity of that reflection.0.107 (0.350)Mean (I)/σ (I)14.5 (4.3)Completeness (%)99.8 (98.5)Redundancy11.4 (5.4)SAD phasingNumber of sites7 (out of a possible 7)Figure of merit (49.7-2.5 Å)0.46Refinement statisticsProtein molecules (chains) in absorbance units1Residues194Water molecules47Total number of atoms1503RcrystcRcryst = Σhkl||Fobs| − |Fcalc||/Σhkl|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes, respectively./RfreedRfree is calculated based on 5% of the reflections randomly excluded from refinement.

Open table in a new tab The overall dimension of TV-1 VP4 is ∼38 Å × 34 Å × 39 Å. Electrostatic analysis reveals a significant amount of positively charged surface, consistent with its theoretical isoelectric point of 9.8 (residues 619–830). This is a unique characteristic of TV-1 VP4, the theoretical isoelectric point of VP4 from other birnaviruses ranges from 4.7 to 6.6. TV-1 VP4 has an α/β-fold consisting of 16 β-strands (β1–β16), four α-helices (α1–α4), and two 310 helices (η1–η2) (Fig. 2). β-Strands 1 to 9, 15, and 16 form two β-sheets that are predominantly arranged in an anti-parallel fashion. This β-sheet region houses the substrate binding groove and specificity pockets. One 310-helix and one α-helix (α1) are also found in this region. Adjacent to this β-sheet platform is a parallel β-sheet made up of three short strands (β10, β13, and β14). This β-sheet is surrounded by three α-helices (α2–α4) and a β-hairpin (β11 and β12). The nucleophilic Ser738 is located at the amino-terminal end of α2 and the general base Lys777 is part of α3. The C-terminal residues (809–830) of TV-1 VP4 wrap around the perimeter of the molecule such that it ultimately arrives with Ala830 (the P1 residue for the VP4/VP3 cleavage site and the last residue in the expressed construct) directly adjacent to the Ser738 nucleophile. The C-terminal residues pack tightly against the VP4 surface with β15 hydrogen bonding with β7 and β16 hydrogen bonding with β2. The loop that connects β15 and β16 passes under the β-hairpin extension made up of β2 and β3 (Fig. 2). There is clear continuous electron density from the Ser738 Oγ to the carbonyl carbon of Ala830 (the C terminus of VP4, P1 residue for the VP4/VP3 cleavage site) (Fig. 3A). The electron density at the active site therefore shows that this structure is an intramolecular (cis) acyl-enzyme complex or intermediate for the TV-1 VP4/VP3 cleavage site. The covalent linkage between the side chain hydroxyl Oγ of Ser738 and the main chain carbonyl of Ala830 fits the electron density with a trigonal planer geometry expected for an ester linkage (44Katona G.

Lee J.M. Lu C.J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6835-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The last three residues of TV-1 VP4 (Ala830(P1) to Ala828(P3) of the VP4/VP3 cleavage site (46Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4695) Google Scholar)) are stabilized by anti-parallel β-sheet type hydrogen bonding interactions with residues 651 to 653 of β-strand 2 and parallel β-sheet type hydrogen bonding interactions with residues 733 to 737 of β-strand 9 (Fig. 3B). The β-sheet style interaction between the C-terminal residues and the VP4 substrate binding groove are extended with the help of an ordered water molecule (water 2). This ordered water forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of the P4 residue (Val827) and the main chain nitrogen of Asp653 (Fig. 3B). The shallow and uncharged S3 binding pocket that accommodates Ala828 (P3) is formed by residues Val650, Leu651, Met652, Phe663, Pro732, Gln733, and Leu734. The P1 residue (Ala830) of the VP4/VP3 junction fits into a pocket made up of atoms from Leu648, Pro649, Val650, Leu734, Ala735, Phe736, Ser738, and Trp739. There are no binding pockets for the P2, P4, or P5 residues as these side chains are pointing away from the substrate binding surface. This wild-type VP4 structure provides an opportunity to observe the atomic position of the catalytic residues during the acyl-enzyme intermediate stage of the reaction cycle for the VP4/VP3 cleavage event, just before the ester bond within the acyl-enzyme intermediate is attacked by a catalytic (deacylating) water. Results from a previous mutagenesis study suggested that TV-1 VP4 utilizes a serine/lysine catalytic dyad (6Nobiron I. Galloux M. Henry C. Torhy C. Boudinot P. Lejal N. Da Costa B. Delmas B. Virology. 2007; 371: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The proposed nucleophilic Oγ of Ser738 is oriented toward the Nζ of the proposed general base Lys777 (Fig. 3B). However, the presence of a sulfate bound just adjacent to Lys777 has steered the Nζ of Lys777 slightly away from the Ser738 Oγ. This sulfate sits in a positively charged pocket just adjacent to the general base Lys777 and is coordinated by the Nζ of Lys777, the Oγ1 of Thr760, the Nδ2 of Asn771, and the main chain amide nitrogens of Leu772 and Leu773. The Nζ of the general base Lys777 is also coordinated via hydrogen bonds to the Oγ1 of Thr760 and a highly ordered and barrier water (water 1) (Fig. 3B). The Nζ of Lys777 is completely buried (0.0 Å2 of accessible surface area) within the active site of this acyl-enzyme intermediate structure (the average accessible surface area for the 10 other lysine Nζ within TV-1 VP4 is 50.7 Å2). The covalently bound C-terminal carbonyl oxygen of Ala830 points into an oxyanion hole assembled from the main chain NH of Ser738 and Asn737. Due to a low level of sequence identity, the TV-1 VP4 is categorized into a separate protease family (S69) from the other VP4 proteases (S50). Despite this low level of sequence identity, a comparison of the BSNV, IPNV, and TV-1 VP4 structures reveals an overall conservation of tertiary structure (Fig. 4). In quantitative terms, TV-1 VP4 shares 20% sequence identity with BSNV VP4 and has a main chain superposition r.m.s. deviation of 3.5 Å. For IPNV VP4, the sequence identity with TV-1 VP4 is only 12% and the main chain superposition r.m.s. deviation is 7.1 Å. A distinguishing feature of TV-1 VP4 is the presence of an α-helix between β-strands 5 and 6, a region that forms a loop structure in both IPNV and BSNV (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 4). Another unique feature of the TV-1 VP4 structure is the presence of two β-strands (β15 and 16) that lead to the C terminus of TV-1 VP4 and form part of the main β-sheet region (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 4). In the intermolecular (trans) acyl-enzyme intermediate structure of IPNV VP4 (Fig. 4C), the C terminus is extended away from the structure and bound to an adjacent active site in a neighboring VP4 molecule. The IPNV VP4 acyl-enzyme structure also has an α-helix near the N terminus. This helix packs against and orders the β-hairpin extension that makes up part of the VP4 sub"

In this work, the stabilization effect of the Sto-RNase HI C-terminal residues was investigated in detail by thermodynamic measurements of the stability of variants lacking the disulfide bond (C58/145A), or the six C-terminal residues (ΔC6) and by structural analysis of ΔC6. The results showed that the C-terminal does not affect overall structure and stabilization is caused by local interactions of the C-terminal, suggesting that the C-terminal residues could be used as a ""stabilization tag."" The Sto-RNase HI C-terminal residues (-IGCIILT) were introduced as a tag on three proteins. Each chimeric protein was more stable than its wild-type protein. These results suggested the possibility of a simple stabilization technique using a stabilization tag such as Sto-RNase HI C-terminal residues."
https://openalex.org/W2028722405,"Residues comprising the guanine nucleotide-binding sites of the α subunits of heterotrimeric (large) G-proteins (Gα subunits), as well as the Ras-related (small) G-proteins, are highly conserved. This is especially the case for the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) where both Gα subunits and Ras-related G-proteins have a conserved serine or threonine residue. Substitutions for this residue in Ras and related (small) G-proteins yield nucleotide-depleted, dominant-negative mutants.

The αT*(S43N) mutant exhibits a significantly higher rate of intrinsic GDP-GTP exchange compared with wild-type αT*, with light-activated rhodopsin (R*) causing only a moderate increase in the kinetics of nucleotide exchange on αT*(S43N). The αT*(S43N) mutant, when bound to either GDP or GTP, was able to significantly slow the rate of R*-catalyzed GDP-GTP exchange on wild-type αT*.

Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 5Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2007; 74: 67-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structures of various Gα subunits have shown that they are composed of two distinct domains: one that highly resembles the GTPase domain of the small G-protein Ras, and a second domain which is mainly α-helical in content and thus referred to as the helical domain. The guanine nucleotide is nestled between these two domains (4Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 5Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2007; 74: 67-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The binding of GTP to αT induces structural changes within 3 regions of the GTPase domain, designated as Switches 1, 2, and 3. The vertebrate visual system in rod cells has provided an excellent model system for understanding how GPCRs activate heterotrimeric G-proteins and subsequently their downstream targets (6Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2005; 48: 387-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 7Chen C.K. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 154: 101-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the visual transduction pathway, the absorption of a photon leads to the isomerization of the covalently-bound chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, to its all-trans configuration. This converts rhodopsin to its functionally active conformation referred to as metarhodopsin II (R*). The heterotrimeric G-protein transducin is made up of a GDP-bound α subunit (αT-GDP), as well as the β1 and γ1 subunits, which are noncovalently complexed to each other and can be dissociated only by denaturation. The R* species binds to heterotrimeric transducin (αT-GDP/β1γ1) with an extremely high affinity. This results in a weakening of the affinity of αT for GDP such that it dissociates from the G-protein. GTP then binds to αT yielding a species (αT-GTP) that has a reduced affinity for both R* and β1γ1. The structural changes in the switch regions of αT-GTP allow it to bind and activate the downstream effector enzyme, the cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). The PDE is made up of two catalytic subunits (αPDE and βPDE) and two smaller regulatory subunits (γPDE) and catalyzes the rapid hydrolysis of cGMP to GMP. The αT-GTP species binds to γPDE and relieves its inhibition of the catalytic activity of the αPDE and βPDE subunits. The activation of PDE is terminated by the hydrolysis of GTP by αT, which is catalyzed by RGS9. The conversion of cGMP to GMP leads to a closure of cGMP-gated channels on the rod cell membrane. This hyperpolarization results in an inhibition of neurotransmitter release, which represents the signal that is conveyed to the optic nerve. Our laboratory has been interested in identifying and biochemically characterizing αT mutants that might help to shed light on the mechanism by which GDP is released from a Gα subunit, thus leading to G-protein activation (8Mittal R.

These efforts have resulted in the identification of various Gα mutants with novel biochemical properties. Owing to the difficulties in overexpressing native αT in Escherichia coli, we have used a chimera of αT and αi1, referred to as αT*, as a starting Gα-backbone for these studies (13Skiba N.P. Thomas T.O. Hamm H.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 502-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). G-proteins belonging to both the monomeric (small) and heterotrimeric (large) G-protein families have a conserved serine or threonine residue in the P-loop. Mutation of this residue in the small G-protein Ras results in the stabilization of its nucleotide-free form relative to both its GDP- and GTP-bound forms (14John J. Rensland H. Schlichting I. Vetter I. Borasio G.D. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This yields a Ras protein that has an enhanced affinity for Ras-guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Ras-GEFs) and thereby has been used as a dominant-negative inhibitor of signaling by endogenous Ras in cells. Mutations of this residue have also been performed in some Gα subunits. In the case of Gαo or Gαi2, such changes resulted in their having an enhanced affinity for the Gβγ subunit complex (15Slepak V.Z. Quick M.W. Aragay A.M. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21889-21894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Slepak V.Z. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A similar mutation in GαS gave rise to an enhanced affinity for the β-adrenergic receptor (17Cleator J.H. Mehta N.D. Kurtz D.T. Hildebrandt J.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study, we have changed the conserved serine residue in the P-loop of αT* to an asparagine residue (S43N). This mutant, unlike wild-type αT*, is able to undergo GDP-GTP exchange at a significant rate even in the absence of R*. Similar to the phenotype shown by the GαS mutant toward the β-adrenergic receptor, the αT*(S43N) mutant, when in the GDP-bound state, slows R*-stimulated GDP-GTP exchange upon wild-type αT*. In addition, we show that the GTPγS-bound form of αT*(S43N) is capable of activating the PDE and of slowing R*-stimulated GDP-GTP exchange upon wild-type αT*. Moreover, using the activation of PDE as a probe, we have been able to show that GTPγS-bound αT*(S43N) stabilizes what may represent an intermediate complex that forms along the G-protein activation pathway and consists of both R* and the β1γ1 subunit complex, together with the αT subunit. During the course of our studies, Artemyev and co-workers (18Natochin M. Barren B. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6488-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) reported the characterization of the same mutation within the chimeric αT* subunit. However, they reported that αT*(S43N) was not capable of undergoing an exchange of GTP for GDP. We believe that this was likely due to a step in their purification protocol that was carried out at room temperature that would have resulted in the loss of the bound nucleotide. We have indeed observed that prolonged incubation of the αT*(S43N) mutant at room temperature renders it unable to bind GTPγS, and while it is still capable of binding to R* and preventing it from activating wild-type αT*, it no longer exhibits many of the features that we describe below. Frozen dark-adapted bovine retina were obtained from Lawson (Lincoln, NE). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Rod outer segment (ROS) membranes were isolated as described (19Fawzi A.B. Northup J.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3804-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Holo-transducin and PDE were obtained from ROS membranes essentially as described (20Kroll S. Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4490-4497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PDE was further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 200 HR26/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with HMAG buffer (20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na-azide, and 10% glycerol). Urea-washed disc membranes were prepared as described and served as the source of R* (21Min K.C. Gravina S.A. Sakmar T.P. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 20: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Holo-transducin was applied to two 5-ml Hitrap Blue-Sepharose columns (GE Healthcare), connected in tandem, that had been pre-equilibrated in G1G0A buffer (10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). The columns were first washed with 250 ml of G1G0A buffer. This was followed by a 250 ml of low salt wash (G1G0A buffer + 100 mm KCl) to elute the β1γ1 complex. The αT subunit was then eluted with 250 ml of high salt buffer (G1G0A buffer + 500 mm KCl). The β1γ1 subunit complex was further purified by ion exchange chromatography using a 5-ml Hitrap Q-Sepharose column by applying a NaCl gradient (0–500 mm, 150 ml) in HMAG buffer (20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na-azide, and 10% glycerol). The β1γ1 complex eluted at a salt concentration of ∼100 mm and was then concentrated, flash-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. We have used a construct designated pHis6Chi8, which was obtained from Dr. Heidi Hamm (Vanderbilt University). This chimera has the corresponding region from αi1 inserted between residues 215 and 295 of αT. In addition, residues 244 and 247 were changed back to the original amino acids in αT, yielding what we refer to as αT*. The recombinant αT* subunits, both wild-type and S43N, were expressed in BL21 (DE3) supercompetent cells and purified as described (11Majumdar S. Ramachandran S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Skiba N.P. Thomas T.O. Hamm H.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 502-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were further purified by ion exchange chromatography as outlined for the β1γ1 complex. The proteins were concentrated, aliquoted, snap-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. The final yield of chimeric αT* was typically ∼1–2 mg of pure protein/liter of bacterial culture. Nucleotide occupancy of the purified recombinant αT* and αT*(S43N) was determined using HPLC (11Majumdar S. Ramachandran S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The amount of active, functional αT* was determined by assaying [35S]GTPγS binding activity. Rhodopsin was light activated (R*) by incubation in ambient light for 5 min on ice. The αT* subunits (500 nm) were incubated in the presence of 50 nm R*, 500 nm β1γ1, and 50 μm [35S]GTPγS, in HMDM buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside) at a total volume of 100 μl, for 1–2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, 40-μl aliquots were applied, in duplicate, to prewet nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell, pore size, 0.45 μm) on a suction manifold. The filters were washed twice with HM buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2), added to scintillation liquid (30% LSC Scintisafe Mixture), and counted in a scintillation counter (LS6500 multipurpose scintillation counter). All protein concentrations of αT* were determined by this procedure. R* and β1γ1 were mixed with [35S]GTPγS to give a final GTPγS concentration of 50 μm in HMDM buffer. The GDP-GTP exchange reaction was initiated by the addition of αT*, with the final volume of the reaction mixture being 300 μl. At different times, 20-μl aliquots were added to prewetted nitrocellulose filters and processed as described in the previous section. Fluorescence measurements were carried out using a Varian eclipse spectrofluorimeter. The binding of aluminum fluoride (AlF4−) was measured by monitoring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of αT* (excitation: 280 nm; emission: 340 nm). αT* (300 nm) was mixed with 1 ml of HMDM buffer at room temperature and the tryptophan fluorescence emission was monitored continuously for 1 min. Subsequently, AlF4− (final concentrations: 5 mm NaF and 100 μm AlCl3) was added while monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence emission in real-time. GTPγS binding to αT* was monitored by premixing R* (prepared as described above) and β1γ1 in HMDM buffer containing GTPγS (50 μm) and monitoring tryptophan fluorescence (excitation: 300 nm; emission: 345 nm) in real-time. Subsequently, αT* (300 nm) was added. All kinetic traces were corrected for the fluorescence from R* and β1γ1. The inhibition of GDP-GTP exchange upon αT*(wild-type) by the GDP-bound form of αT*(S43N) was measured by monitoring the kinetics of GTPγS binding using tryptophan fluorescence. This was carried out with 300 nm αT*(wild-type), R* (5 nm), β1γ1 (300 nm), 50 μm GTPγS, and varying concentrations of αT*(S43N). The GTPγS-bound form of αT*(S43N) was prepared by incubating the protein (5 μm) with 100 μm GTPγS in HMDM buffer at room temperature for 2 h. The protein was subsequently placed on ice. αT*(S43N)-GTPγS was added at varying concentrations to a cuvette containing a mixture of R* (5 nm), β1γ1 (300 nm), and GTPγS (50 μm). Tryptophan fluorescence was monitored for 1 min and αT*(wild-type) was added, and the kinetics of GTPγS binding were monitored. All kinetic data were fitted to a single exponential Equation 1, F=F∞−(F∞−F0)exp(−kobst)(Eq. 1) where F = fluorescence signal at any time t, F0 = fluorescence signal at time t = 0, F∞ = fluorescence signal at t = ∞, kobs = observed rate constant. The β1γ1 complex (10 μm) was incubated in a buffer containing 20 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.5) and 5 mm MgCl2 with a 0.5 mm solution of 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS), dissolved in dimethyl formamide, at room temperature in the dark for 2 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol at 11.2 mm. The labeled β1γ1 was separated from free probe and exchanged into HMAG buffer on a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). The extent of incorporation of the IAEDANS moiety was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 5600 m−1 cm−1 at 336 nm. The stoichiometry of labeling was determined by correcting the absorbance at 280 nm for IAEDANS absorption and measuring the concentration of β1γ1 using the calculated extinction coefficient of 53,600 m−1 cm−1. The stoichiometry of labeling was determined to be 1.2 ± 0.1 mol per mol β1γ1. Anisotropy measurements of IAEDANS-labeled β1γ1 complexes were carried out on a Cary eclipse spectrofluorimeter in the L-format. All reported anisotropy values have been corrected by determination of G-factors using horizontally polarized light. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 336 nm (bandwidth = 10 nm) and 490 nm (bandwidth = 20 nm), respectively. An integration time of 10 s was used for all measurements. The analysis of cGMP hydrolysis by the retinal PDE was carried out as described (22Liebman P.A. Evanczuk A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, a pH microelectrode was used to measure the decrease in pH resulting from the production of a proton for each molecule of cGMP hydrolyzed by PDE. All assays were carried out at 22 °C in a final volume of 300 μl containing 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 (AB buffer). The dose response for the activation of PDE by αT* was determined by mixing R* (118 nm), β1γ1 (370 nm), 100 μm GTPγS, and αT* in AB buffer. This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1–2 h. PDE (70 nm) was added and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 mm cGMP. At the end of each assay period, the buffering capacity (in mV/nmol) was determined by adding 500 nmol of sodium hydroxide. The rate of hydrolysis of cGMP (nmol/s) was determined from the ratio of the initial slope of the pH record (mV/nmol) and the buffering capacity of the assay buffer (mV/nmol). GTPγS-bound αT*(S43N) was prepared by incubating the αT* subunit (5 μm) with GTPγS (100 μm) in AB buffer for 2 h at room temperature. To determine the effects of R* and the β1γ1 subunit complex on PDE activation, R* and/or β1γ1 were mixed with GTPγS-bound αT*(S43N), diluted in AB buffer containing 100 μm GTPγS to a final concentration of 250 nm, and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. PDE and cGMP were added to this mixture and the PDE activity measured as described above. Both the Gα subunits of large G-proteins and the Ras-related small G-proteins bind to GDP with a very high affinity. This explains the requirement for an activated GPCR or a GEF to catalyze the dissociation of GDP from Gα subunits and Ras-related G-proteins, respectively, in order for GDP-GTP exchange to occur. In the case of the small G-proteins, the highly conserved serine/threonine residues in the P-loop help to coordinate Mg2+, which is essential for the high affinity binding of GDP, such that substitutions at this site yield nucleotide-depleted, dominant-negative mutants (14John J. Rensland H. Schlichting I. Vetter I. Borasio G.D. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Magnesium is not necessary for the high affinity binding of GDP to the Gα subunits of large G-proteins, possibly because of their helical domain, which is lacking in the small G-proteins (23Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 762-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the x-ray crystal structure of the GDP-bound form of αT shows that the main-chain nitrogen of the serine residue at position 43 makes a hydrogen bond with one of the non-bridging oxygens on the β-phosphate of GDP, thereby suggesting a potentially important role in high-affinity binding (24Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In addition, there have been suggestions that substitutions for the conserved P-loop serine/threonine residue in Gα subunits yield dominant-negative inhibitors, raising the question of whether these mutants are also nucleotide-depleted (16Slepak V.Z. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4037-4041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Cleator J.H. Mehta N.D. Kurtz D.T. Hildebrandt J.D.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed HPLC analysis to determine whether the αT*(S43N) mutant, following its purification, still contained bound guanine nucleotide. We found that as in the case for the wild-type αT* subunit, the αT*(S43N) mutant was purified with stoichiometric amounts of bound GDP (Fig. 1), i.e. with stoichiometries of 1 ± 0.1 mol GDP per mol αT* and 0.8 ± 0.1 mol GDP per mol αT*(S43N). The x-ray crystal structure for the aluminum fluoride (AlF4−)/GDP-bound form of αT shows that AlF4− occupies the γ-phosphate-binding site of GTP (28Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). This structure has been postulated to resemble the transition state for GTP hydrolysis. When AlF4− binds to the GDP-bound form of αT, there is an increase in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence due to a conformational change in the Switch 2 region, one of three regions of αT that change conformation upon binding GTP (29Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15498-15505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, a robust increase in tryptophan fluorescence was observed upon addition of AlF4− to the wild-type αT* subunit (Fig. 2). However, the addition of AlF4− to the αT*(S43N) mutant did not cause a detectable change in tryptophan fluorescence. This was not entirely unexpected since the presence of Mg2+ is required for the AlF4−-induced enhancement in tryptophan fluorescence. The x-ray crystal structures of both the GTPγS- and AlF4−-bound forms of αT show that the side-chain hydroxyl oxygen of Ser-43 is one of the coordination sites for the bound divalent cation (Mg2+ in the GTPγS-bound αT structure and Ca2+ in the AlF4−-bound αT structure) (28Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 30Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Thus, the αT*(S43N) mutant would have a reduced affinity for Mg2+ and, consequently, might not be able to undergo the AlF4−-induced conformational change that alters the position of Switch 2 and enhances its intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Wild-type αT* undergoes very slow guanine nucleotide exchange when assayed in the absence of R* and β1γ1, as monitored by either the enhancement in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence that accompanies the exchange of GDP for GTPγS (kobs = 0.01 min−1), or by using a filter binding assay to measure the exchange of GDP for [35S]GTPγS (0.02 min−1) (Fig. 3A, open squares). This is similar to the spontaneous nucleotide exchange rate reported earlier (31Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7865-7869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that the αT*(S43N) mutant undergoes nucleotide exchange with a rate constant that is about 4–8-fold faster than that for the wild-type αT* subunit (kobs = 0.09 min−1) as monitored using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 3A, dotted line). A similar rate constant was obtained when using a filter binding assay to measure the exchange of GDP for [35S]GTPγS (kobs = 0.08 min−1). A filter binding assay was used to measure the rate of dissociation of GDP using wild-type αT* or αT*(S43N) that had been pre-loaded with [3H]GDP. This experiment showed that the rate of release of GDP from αT*(S43N) was 4-fold faster than that of wild-type αT* (Fig. 3A, inset). Thus, changing the serine to asparagine at position 43 within the αT* subunit apparently causes a change in the conformation of the P-loop such that there is an increase in the rate of GDP dissociation, which has been suggested to be the rate-limiting step for GDP-GTP exchange (32Ferguson K.M. Higashijima T. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7393-7399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When R* was added together with the β1γ1 subunit complex to wild-type αT*, there was the expected marked increase in the rate of GDP-GTP exchange. For example, the addition of 12 nm R*, along with 300 nm β1γ1, to 300 nm wild-type αT* increased the rate constant for guanine nucleotide exchange by at least 500-fold (Fig. 3B, inset, open triangles). This rate enhancement due to light-activated rhodopsin is similar to what has been reported earlier (10Majumdar S. Ramachandran S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40137-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the addition of even relatively high levels of R* to the αT*(S43N) mutant had only minimal effects on the rate of nucleotide exchange (Fig. 3B). Specifically, when the αT*(S43N) mutant was assayed in the presence of 112 nm R* and 400 nm β1γ1, the rate constant for GDP-GTP exchange was increased by only ∼3-fold. The rate of GDP-GTP exchange upon wild-type αT* was too fast to be measured under these conditions (Fig. 3B, inset, open squares). These findings suggested either that the αT*(S43N) mutant is impaired in its ability to interact with R* or that the release of R* from the activated, GTPγS-bound mutant is slow relative to its rate of release from wild-type αT*, thus compromising the ability of R* to act catalytically. The β1γ1 subunit complex has been shown to increase the affinity of GPCRs like R* for their Gα-signaling partners, as well as to help GPCRs to further increase the rate of G-protein activation (33Phillips W.J.

https://openalex.org/W2114388025,"Background After dental extraction, the external surface of alveolar bone undergoes resorption at various rates, and a group of patients develop excessive jawbone atrophy. Oral mucosa overlying the atrophied jawbone is unusually thin; therefore, we have hypothesized that excessive jawbone atrophy may be associated with abnormal oral mucosa contraction. FGFR1OP2/wit3.0, a cytoskeleton molecule initially identified in oral wound fibroblasts, has been shown to induce oral mucosa contraction after dental extraction. This study examined the genetic association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FGFR1OP2/wit3.0 and excessive atrophy of edentulous mandible. Methods and Findings First, the expression of FGFR1OP2/wit3.0 was determined in gingival tissues of 8 subjects before and after dental extraction. In situ hybridization revealed that all subject increased FGFR1OP2/wit3.0 expression in the post-operative oral mucosa tissues; however, significantly high levels of FGFR1OP2/wit3.0 were observed in 3 out of 8 subjects. In a separate study, 20 long-term edentulous subjects (66.4±9.4 years) were recruited. Tag-SNPs in the FGFR1OP2/wit3.0 allele were determined by Taqman-based polymerase chain reaction. The mandibular bone height was determined following the American College of Prosthodontists (ACP) protocol. Subjects with minor allele of rs840869 or rs859024 were found in the highly atrophied group by the ACP classification (Chi square test, p = 0.0384 and p = 0.0565, respectively; Fisher's Exact, p = 0.0515 and p = 0.2604, respectively). The linear regression analysis indicated a suggestive association between rs859024 and the decreased bone heights (Mann-Whitney, p = 0.06). The average bone height of the subjects with rs840869 or rs859024 minor alleles (10.6±3.2 mm and 9.6±3.2 mm, respectively) was significantly smaller than that of those subjects with the major alleles (14.2±4.5 mm, p<0.05). Conclusions The patients with the minor allele of rs840869 or rs859024 were associated with excessive atrophy of edentulous mandible. This study may provide the basis for a genetic marker identifying susceptible individuals to develop jawbone atrophy after dental extraction."

We have previously established a chronic cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-treated human oral normal keratinocyte model, demonstrating an elevated frequency of mitochondrial mutations in CSE treated cells. Using this model we further characterized the mechanism by which chronic CSE treatment induces increased cellular proliferation.We demonstrate that chronic CSE treatment upregulates PDK2 expression, decreases PDH activity and thereby increases the glycolytic metabolites pyruvate and lactate. We also found that the chronic CSE treatment enhanced HIF1α accumulation through increased pyruvate and lactate production in a manner selectively reversible by ascorbate. Use of a HIF1α small molecule inhibitor blocked the growth induced by chronic CSE treatment in OKF6 cells. Furthermore, chronic CSE treatment was found to increase ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, and application of the ROS scavengers N-acetylcysteine abrogated the expression of PDK2 and HIF1α. Notably, treatment with dichloroacetate, a PDK2 inhibitor, also decreased the HIF1α expression as well as cell proliferation in chronic CSE treated OKF6 cells.Our findings suggest that chronic CSE treatment contribute to cell growth via increased ROS production through mitochondrial mutations, upregulation of PDK2, attenuating PDH activity thereby increasing glycolytic metabolites, resulting in HIF1α stabilization. This study suggests a role for chronic tobacco exposure in the development of aerobic glycolysis and normoxic HIFα activation as a part of HNSCC initiation. These data may provide insights into development of chemopreventive strategies for smoking related cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2086303352,"In a previous study, we observed that associations between APOE rs439401 and metabolic traits were moderated by chronic stress. Thus, in a population of stressed and non-stressed Danish men, we examined whether associations between APOE rs439401 and a panel of metabolic quantitative traits, all metabolic traits which may lead to T2D and CVD were moderated by psychological stress.Obese young men (n = 475, BMI ≥ 31.0 kg/m(2)) and a randomly selected control group (n = 709) identified from a population of 141,800 men were re-examined in two surveys (S-46: mean age 46, S-49: mean age 49 years) where anthropometric and biochemical measures were available. Psychological stress factors were assessed by a self-administered 7-item questionnaire. Each item had the possible response categories ""yes"" and ""no"" and assessed familial problems and conflicts. Summing positive responses constituted a stress item score, which was then dichotomized into stressed and non-stressed. Logistic regression analysis, applying a recessive genetic model, was used to assess odds ratios (OR) of the associations between APOE rs439401 genotypes and adverse levels of metabolic traits.The APOE rs439401 TT-genotype associated positively with BMI (OR = 1.09 [1.01; 1.17]), waist circumference (OR = 1.09 [1.02; 1.17]) in stressed men at S-46. Positive associations were observed for fasting plasma glucose (OR = 1.42 [1.07; 1.87]), serum triglycerides (OR = 1.41 [1.05; 1.91]) and with fasting plasma insulin (OR = 1.48 [1.05; 2.08]) in stressed men at S-49. Rs439401 TT-genotype also associated positively with surrogate measures of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; OR = 1.21 [1.03; 1.41]) and inversely with insulin sensitivity (Stumvoll index; OR = 0.90 [0.82; 0.99], BIGTT-S(I); OR = 0.60 [0.43; 0.85]) in stressed men. No significant associations were observed in non-stressed men, albeit the estimates showed similar but weaker trends as in stressed men.The present results suggest that the APOE rs439401 TT-genotype is associated with an adverse metabolic profile in a population of psychologically stressed Danish men."
https://openalex.org/W2054641355,"Background In the continuum between a stroke and a circle including all possible ellipses, some eccentricities seem more “biologically preferred” than others by the motor system, probably because they imply less demanding coordination patterns. Based on the idea that biological motion perception relies on knowledge of the laws that govern the motor system, we investigated whether motorically preferential and non-preferential eccentricities are visually discriminated differently. In contrast with previous studies that were interested in the effect of kinematic/time features of movements on their visual perception, we focused on geometric/spatial features, and therefore used a static visual display. Methodology/Principal Findings In a dual-task paradigm, participants visually discriminated 13 static ellipses of various eccentricities while performing a finger-thumb opposition sequence with either the dominant or the non-dominant hand. Our assumption was that because the movements used to trace ellipses are strongly lateralized, a motor task performed with the dominant hand should affect the simultaneous visual discrimination more strongly. We found that visual discrimination was not affected when the motor task was performed by the non-dominant hand. Conversely, it was impaired when the motor task was performed with the dominant hand, but only for the ellipses that we defined as preferred by the motor system, based on an assessment of individual preferences during an independent graphomotor task. Conclusions/Significance Visual discrimination of ellipses depends on the state of the motor neural networks controlling the dominant hand, but only when their eccentricity is “biologically preferred”. Importantly, this effect emerges on the basis of a static display, suggesting that what we call “biological geometry”, i.e., geometric features resulting from preferential movements is relevant information for the visual processing of bidimensional shapes."
