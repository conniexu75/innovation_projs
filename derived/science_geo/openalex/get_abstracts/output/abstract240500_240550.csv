https://openalex.org/W2128631317,"A growing body of evidence indicates that an inflammatory process in the substantia nigra, characterized by activation of resident microglia, likely either initiates or aggravates nigral neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). To study the mechanisms by which nigral microglia are activated in PD, the potential role of alpha-synuclein (a major component of Lewy bodies that can cause neurodegeneration when aggregated) in microglial activation was investigated. The results demonstrated that in a primary mesencephalic neuron-glia culture system, extracellular aggregated human alpha-synuclein indeed activated microglia; microglial activation enhanced dopaminergic neurodegeneration induced by aggregated alpha-synuclein. Furthermore, microglial enhancement of alpha-synuclein-mediated neurotoxicity depended on phagocytosis of alpha-synuclein and activation of NADPH oxidase with production of reactive oxygen species. These results suggest that nigral neuronal damage, regardless of etiology, may release aggregated alpha-synuclein into substantia nigra, which activates microglia with production of proinflammatory mediators, thereby leading to persistent and progressive nigral neurodegeneration in PD. Finally, NADPH oxidase could be an ideal target for potential pharmaceutical intervention, given that it plays a critical role in alpha-synuclein-mediated microglial activation and associated neurotoxicity."

Mitochondria from Ppif–/– mice had no CyP-D and displayed a striking desensitization of the PTP to Ca2+, in that pore opening required about twice the Ca2+ load necessary to open the pore in strain-matched, wild-type mitochondria. Mitochondria lacking CyP-D were insensitive to Cyclosporin A (CsA), which increased the Ca2+ retention capacity only in mitochondria from wild-type mice. The PTP response to ubiquinone 0, depolarization, pH, adenine nucleotides, and thiol oxidants was similar in mitochondria from wild-type and Ppif–/– mice. These experiments demonstrate that (i) the PTP can form and open in the absence of CyP-D, (ii) that CyP-D represents the target for PTP inhibition by CsA, and (iii) that CyP-D modulates the sensitivity of the PTP to Ca2+ but not its regulation by the proton electrochemical gradient, adenine nucleotides, and oxidative stress. These results have major implications for our current understanding of the PTP and its modulation in vitro and in vivo.

The “permeability transition” is a sudden increase of the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability to ions and solutes, which causes dissipation of Δψm, 1The abbreviations used are: Δψm, mitochondrial membrane potential; CsA, cyclosporin A; CRC, calcium retention capacity; CyP-D, cyclophilin D; Δp, proton electrochemical gradient; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PTP, permeability transition pore; Ub0, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (ubiquinone 0). loss of mitochondrial ion homeostasis, impairment of ATP synthesis, and diffusion of solutes down their concentration gradient (1Hunter D.R.

In vitro, at least, this is followed by an osmotically obligatory water flux across the inner membrane with passive swelling, outer membrane rupture, and cytochrome c release (2Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). This complex phenomenon is due to opening of a regulated, high conductance channel of unknown molecular structure, the PTP. PTP opening requires matrix Ca2+, and its open-closed transitions are affected by a striking number of agents that may converge on a set of control elements such as the Δψm (3Bernardi P. J. Biol.

Interest in the permeability transition as an executioner mechanism of cell death through Ca2+ deregulation and ATP depletion dates to the early 1990s (6Broekemeier K.M. Carpenter Deyo L. Reed D.J.

The ensuing caspase 9 activation may lead to activation of effector caspase 3 in the so called intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway to apoptosis (12Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). A fundamental discovery was the identification of CsA as a high affinity inhibitor of the PTP (13Fournier N. Ducet G. Crevat A.

The putative receptor for CsA is CyP-D, a matrix peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase that is inhibited by CsA in the same range of concentrations that inhibits the pore (16Davidson A.M. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) through an effect that does not require calcineurin inhibition (17Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V.

Largely through the use of CsA key advances have been made in understanding the role of the PTP in several ex vivo and in vivo models of disease such as ischemia-reperfusion injury of the heart (18Griffiths E.J.

Hepatology. 2000; 31: 674-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Evidence that CyP-D is a modulator of the PTP remains indirect, however, and CyP-D overexpression did not cause the expected sensitization to cell death but rather protected from cell death induced by oxidative stress and mediated by mitochondria (35Lin D.T. Lechleiter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31134-31141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To unambiguously resolve basic questions related to the role of CyP-D in PTP regulation, and the function of the permeability transition in normal biological processes like programmed and accidental cell death, we have generated a mouse line in which the expression of CyP-D has been eliminated by “knock-out” of the Ppif gene. We report here for the first time the properties of the permeability transition in mitochondria from Ppif–/– animals, which are devoid of CyP-D. Part of these results have already been presented in abstract form (36Basso E. Bernardi P. Forte M. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 357AGoogle Scholar). Generation and Characterization of Ppif–/–Mice—To identify mouse homologs of human CyP-D gene, degenerate oligonucleotide primers representing sequences encoding the unique N terminus of this molecule (amino acid sequence (residues 30–47) obtained from the purified human protein) and the common C terminus (amino acids 200–208) were used to PCR-amplify sequences encoding this molecule from cDNA generated from mouse liver RNA. To identify and characterize the region of the mouse genome encoding CyP-D, a unique set of PCR probes was generated from full-length mouse cDNA and used to screen a mouse bacterial artificial chromosome genomic library prepared from 129Sv ES cells. Several overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome clones were identified and genomic regions encoding Ppif identified by restriction enzyme digestion, PCR analysis, and Southern blotting. Eventually, a 23.5-kb fragment of genomic sequence containing the Ppif gene was characterized. To generate mice in which the expression of Ppif has been eliminated, ES cells were cultured using standard conditions, transfected by electroporation with the targeting construct, transfectants selected with appropriate antibiotics (G418 and ganciclovir), and candidate ES cells screened by PCR analysis and Southern blotting for replacement of the endogenous Ppif gene with the targeting construct. Male chimeras were subsequently mated with black, non-agouti C57BL/6 female mice and offspring evaluated for germ line transmission. Several of the chimeric males were able to pass the Ppif knock-out gene to progeny as assessed by both PCR analysis and Southern blotting. F1 heterozygotes were then back-crossed for eight generations into a C57BL/6 genetic background and isogenic heterozygotes intercrossed to generate homozygous wild-type and Ppif–/– animals. To assess the expression of CyP-D protein in mice of the indicated genotypes, mitochondria were prepared from liver, heart, and kidney by homogenization and differential centrifugation following published protocols. Mitochondrial proteins were then separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, proteins transferred to nitrocellulose, and blots probed for CyP-D using an antibody generated to unique N-terminal epitope from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO) or the antibody described by Lin and Lechleiter (35Lin D.T. Lechleiter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31134-31141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). An anti-voltage-dependent anion channel antibody kindly provided by Dr. William Craigen (Baylor College of Medicine) was used as a control for loading. Assays on Isolated Mouse Liver Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated from the livers of wild-type and Ppif–/– C57BL/6 mice exactly as described previously for rat liver mitochondria (37Costantini P. Petronilli V. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Toxicology. 1995; 99: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) except that 10 ml of isolation medium per liver were used. The CRC of mitochondrial preparations was assessed fluorimetrically in the presence of the Ca2+ indicator Calcium Green-5N (Molecular Probes) with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorimeter exactly as described previously (38Fontaine E. Eriksson O. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12662-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically with a Clark oxygen electrode in a closed 2-ml vessel. Mitochondrial swelling was measured as the decrease of 90° light scattering at 540 nm in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 650-40 spectrofluorimeter. All instruments were equipped with magnetic stirring and thermostatic control. The incubation conditions are specified in the figure legends. CyP-D (also known as CyP-F in mice) is a member of the larger cyclophilin family and is equivalent to the previously cloned cDNA encoding human CyP-3 (39Bergsma D.J. Eder C. Gross M. Kersten H. Sylvester D. Appelbaum E. Cusimano D. Livi G.P. McLaughlin M.M. Kasyan K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23204-23214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CyP-D is nuclearly encoded and contains a mitochondrial targeting presequence that is cleaved after translocation of the protein into the matrix (39Bergsma D.J. Eder C. Gross M. Kersten H. Sylvester D. Appelbaum E. Cusimano D. Livi G.P. McLaughlin M.M. Kasyan K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23204-23214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, mature forms of the protein also contain a unique N terminus, which serves to identify CyP-D from other CyP isoforms. Probes generated from sequences encoding human CyP-D were used to identify cDNAs encoding murine CyP-D. Subsequently, sequences representing the Ppif gene encoding CyP-D were characterized (see “Experimental Procedures”) and included 11 kb upstream and 6.5 kb downstream of the translational start and stop sites (Fig. 1). The Ppif gene itself encompasses 5.5 kb of genomic DNA and consists of six protein-coding exons separated by five introns (Fig. 1). Scans of complete human and mouse genome data bases indicate that a single gene encodes CyP-D in mammals and that the murine Ppif gene is located on chromsome 14. To generate strains of mice deficient in CyP-D, a targeting plasmid was generated in which the neo gene was positioned so that the first three exons of the Ppif gene, including 20 bp upstream of the initiating ATG, were eliminated (Fig. 1). The targeting vector itself contained 7 kb of Ppif homology upstream of the initiating ATG and 2 kb of genomic sequence within the Ppif gene flanking the neo gene. The neo gene itself was positioned so that its transcription occurred from the strand opposite to that used to code for Ppif. ES cell lines in which the Ppif gene had been disrupted were identified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA and Southern blotting (data not shown). Positive ES cells were then injected into blastocysts and chimeric offspring evaluated for the ability to generate Ppif+/– offspring. F1 heterozygotes carrying the targeted allele were back-crossed eight times to C57BL/6 animals and heterozygotes then intercrossed to generate isogenic wild-type and Ppif–/– mice. PCR analysis of genomic DNA from Ppif+/+, Ppif+/–, and Ppif–/– mice confirmed that the Ppif gene had been disrupted (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Analysis of CyP-D at the protein level revealed that expression was reduced to roughly 50% in liver mitochondria from Ppif+/– animals and that no CyP-D protein was detectable in mitochondria prepared from liver (Fig. 2A, lower panel), kidney, or heart (data not shown) of Ppif–/– mice. Despite the absence of CyP-D, mitochondria from Ppif–/– mice displayed basal, ADP- and uncoupler-stimulated rates of respiration that were indistinguishable from those of mitochondria prepared from wild-type mice (Fig. 2B), suggesting that CyP-D does not grossly affect energy conservation and ATP synthesis. We then tested the properties of the permeability transition in liver mitochondria from wild-type and Ppif–/– mice with the sensitive CRC test, which measures the threshold Ca2+ required to open the PTP in a population of mitochondria in suspension. The experiments of Fig. 2C show that mitochondria from Ppif–/– mice required about twice the amount of Ca2+ necessary to open the PTP in wild-type mitochondria (compare traces a and a′). Addition of CsA caused the expected increase of CRC in wild-type (trace b) but not in Ppif–/– mitochondria (trace b′), while both populations were equally sensitive to Ub0 (compare traces c and c′) (see Fig. 4 statistical analysis). These experiments prove that CyP-D modulates the affinity of the PTP for Ca2+ and represent the first direct demonstration that CyP-D is the target for the inhibitory effects of CsA on the PTP. The PTP is modulated by the Δp, in the sense that the pore open probability increases upon depolarization (i.e. as the membrane potential becomes less negative inside) and decreases at acidic matrix pH values (3Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether the lack of CyP-D affected the PTP voltage dependence, we tested the effect of the addition of uncouplers to energized mitochondria preloaded with a small amount of Ca2+ that is not sufficient to open the PTP per se but is permissive for the subsequent opening by depolarization. Like mitochondria from wild-type animals, mitochondria from Ppif–/– mice readily opened the PTP upon the addition of FCCP (Fig. 3A, compare traces a and a′). At variance from the case of wild-type mitochondria, the PTP-dependent swelling response of Ppif–/– mitochondria was insensitive to CsA (compare traces b and b′), while it was as sensitive to Ub0 (compare traces c and c′). It should be stressed that no inhibitory effect was observed in Ppif–/– mitochondria even if the concentration of CsA was raised to 6.4 μm (results not shown). The PTP open probability also displays a remarkable dependence on the pH of the incubation medium (1Hunter D.R. Haworth R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 40Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 715-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PTP inhibition occurs as pH is decreased from 7.4 to 6.4, and we have shown that the inhibitory effect is exerted from the matrix side of the inner membrane (3Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) through reversible protonation of histidyl residues (4Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The PTP is also inhibited as the pH is increased above 7.4 through an undefined mechanism (4Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To assess the dependence of PTP opening on matrix pH we used deenergized mitochondria incubated in a KSCN-based medium (4Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In this system Ca2+ uptake is driven by the SCN– diffusion potential (41Selwyn M.J. Dawson A.P. Dunnett S.J. FEBS Lett. 1970; 10: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ accumulation occurs without changes of matrix pH, which under these conditions closely matches external pH (4Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the PTP response was indistinguishable in Ppif–/– and wild-type mitochondria in the pH range 6.0–7.5, while the Ppif–/– mitochondria were somewhat more sensitive to inhibition by pH 8.0. These results indicate that CyP-D does not mediate the inhibitory effects of acidic matrix pH on the PTP and that the regulatory histidyl residue(s) that can be reversibly blocked by diethylpyrocarbonate (4Nicolli A. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) are not located on CyP-D. The PTP is extremely sensitive to oxidative stress, and a dithiol-disulfide interconversion at vicinal dithiol(s) is of particular relevance in modulating the PTP response to depolarization. The PTP is sensitized as the couple is poised to a more oxidized state (5Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria from Ppif–/– mice were as sensitive as those from wild-type animals to the PTP-inducing effects of diamide (Fig. 3C), which acts through the redox-sensitive dithiol (5Petronilli V. Costantini P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Passamonti S. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16638-16642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If anything, Ppif–/– mitochondria appeared to require slightly lower concentrations of diamide, although the maximal effect was nearly identical to that observed in wild-type mitochondria (see also Fig. 4). Quantitative assessment of the effects on the CRC already described for CsA, Ub0, and diamide is presented in Fig. 4, which also documents the effects of ADP plus oligomycin, which inhibits the PTP (1Hunter D.R. Haworth R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 195: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and of the vicinal dithiol cross-linker phenylarsine oxide, a potent PTP inducer that is effective even in the absence of added Ca2+ (3Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Lenartowicz E. Bernardi P. Azzone G.F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1991; 23: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It can be seen that Ppif–/– mitochondria were fully sensitive to Ub0, which inhibits the pore through a specific site (43Fontaine E. Ichas F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25734-25740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and to ADP, which may be acting through a conformational effect on the adenine nucleotide translocator by locking it in the so-called m-conformation (2Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). The impression that Ub0 and ADP plus oligomycin are more potent inhibitors of the PTP in Ppif–/– than in wild-type mitochondria depends on their higher CRC. Indeed, if the basal CRC values are subtracted from those obtained in the presence of Ub0 or of ADP plus oligomycin the net effects of these treatments are not significantly different in the two groups of animals. Finally, Fig. 4 shows that both diamide and phenylarsine oxide equally affected the PTP in wild-type and Ppif–/– mitochondria. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that the PTP can form and open in the absence of CyP-D. The lack of effects of CsA on the PTP in Ppif–/– mitochondria suggests that CyP-D represents the unique target for PTP inhibition by CsA. A second clear point emerging from our study is that CyP-D modulates the PTP sensitivity to Ca2+. The Ca2+ resistance of the Ppif–/– mitochondria is similar to that observed in mitochondria from mice with genetic inactivation of the adenine nucleotide translocators (44Kokoszka J.E. Waymire K.G. Levy S.E. Sligh J.E. Cai J. Jones D.P. MacGregor G.R. Wallace D.C. Nature. 2004; 427: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar), suggesting that the PTP sensitivity to Ca2+ may depend on multiple factors. It is important to stress that the PTP of Ppif–/– mitochondria maintains its basic regulatory features by the Δp and its sensitivity to activators other than Ca2+ and to inhibitors other than CsA. Ppif–/– pups were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and were otherwise indistiguishable from wild-type, Ppif+/+ C57BL/6 animals suggesting that CyP-D is dispensible for embryonic development and viability of adult mice. It is possible that this lack of an overt phenotype may be due to adaptive responses whereby the decreased sensitivity of the PTP to Ca2+ is bypassed by compensatory mechanisms that are not detectable in isolated mitochondria. An alternative explanation is offered by the finding that CyP-D overexpression desensitized cells from apoptotic stimuli, suggesting that CyP-D may also play a role as a cell survival-signaling molecule acting on one or more targets other than the PTP (35Lin D.T. Lechleiter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31134-31141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This dual function of CyP-D suggests that the proapoptotic and antiapoptic functions may eventually balance in the Ppif–/– animals and that assessing the existence of specific phenotypes in Ppif–/– animals may require the thorough testing of in vivo disease models."

https://openalex.org/W2963080633,"In a pioneering experiment, Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) demonstrated that noise correlations could be used to probe the properties of a (bosonic) particle source through quantum statistics; the effect relies on quantum interference between possible detection paths for two indistinguishable particles. HBT correlations--together with their fermionic counterparts--find numerous applications, ranging from quantum optics to nuclear and elementary particle physics. Spatial HBT interferometry has been suggested as a means to probe hidden order in strongly correlated phases of ultracold atoms. Here we report such a measurement on the Mott insulator phase of a rubidium Bose gas as it is released from an optical lattice trap. We show that strong periodic quantum correlations exist between density fluctuations in the expanding atom cloud. These spatial correlations reflect the underlying ordering in the lattice, and find a natural interpretation in terms of a multiple-wave HBT interference effect. The method should provide a useful tool for identifying complex quantum phases of ultracold bosonic and fermionic atoms."

https://openalex.org/W2018604772,"Progress in the fabrication of nanometre-scale electronic devices is opening new opportunities to uncover deeper aspects of the Kondo effect--a characteristic phenomenon in the physics of strongly correlated electrons. Artificial single-impurity Kondo systems have been realized in various nanostructures, including semiconductor quantum dots, carbon nanotubes and individual molecules. The Kondo effect is usually regarded as a spin-related phenomenon, namely the coherent exchange of the spin between a localized state and a Fermi sea of delocalized electrons. In principle, however, the role of the spin could be replaced by other degrees of freedom, such as an orbital quantum number. Here we show that the unique electronic structure of carbon nanotubes enables the observation of a purely orbital Kondo effect. We use a magnetic field to tune spin-polarized states into orbital degeneracy and conclude that the orbital quantum number is conserved during tunnelling. When orbital and spin degeneracies are present simultaneously, we observe a strongly enhanced Kondo effect, with a multiple splitting of the Kondo resonance at finite field and predicted to obey a so-called SU4 symmetry."
https://openalex.org/W2036937372,"The 100,000-year timescale in the glacial/interglacial cycles of the late Pleistocene epoch (the past ∼700,000 years) is commonly attributed to control by variations in the Earth's orbit1. This hypothesis has inspired models that depend on the Earth's obliquity (∼ 40,000 yr; ∼40 kyr), orbital eccentricity (∼ 100 kyr) and precessional (∼ 20 kyr) fluctuations2,3,4,5, with the emphasis usually on eccentricity and precessional forcing. According to a contrasting hypothesis, the glacial cycles arise primarily because of random internal climate variability6,7,8. Taking these two perspectives together, there are currently more than thirty different models of the seven late-Pleistocene glacial cycles9. Here we present a statistical test of the orbital forcing hypothesis, focusing on the rapid deglaciation events known as terminations10,11. According to our analysis, the null hypothesis that glacial terminations are independent of obliquity can be rejected at the 5% significance level, whereas the corresponding null hypotheses for eccentricity and precession cannot be rejected. The simplest inference consistent with the test results is that the ice sheets terminated every second or third obliquity cycle at times of high obliquity, similar to the original proposal by Milankovitch12. We also present simple stochastic and deterministic models that describe the timing of the late-Pleistocene glacial terminations purely in terms of obliquity forcing."

Myostatin blockade therefore offers a strategy for reversing muscle wasting in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) without resorting to genetic manipulation. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacological blockade using a myostatin propeptide stabilized by fusion to IgG-Fc improved pathophysiology of the mdx mouse model of DMD. Functional benefits evidenced by specific force improvement, exceeded those reported previously using myostatin antibody-mediated blockade. More importantly, use of a propeptide blockade strategy obviates possibilities of anti-idiotypic responses that could potentially limit the effectiveness of antibody-mediated myostatin blockade strategies over time. This study provides a novel pharmacological strategy for treatment of diseases associated with muscle wasting such as DMD and since it uses an endogenous inhibitor of myostatin should help circumvent technical hurdles and toxicity associated with conventional gene or cell based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1979428706,"Several methanogenic archaea lack cysteinyl–transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase (CysRS), the essential enzyme that provides Cys-tRNA Cys for translation in most organisms. Partial purification of the corresponding activity from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii indicated that tRNA Cys becomes acylated with O -phosphoserine (Sep) but not with cysteine. Further analyses identified a class II–type O -phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase (SepRS) and Sep-tRNA:Cys-tRNA synthase (SepCysS). SepRS specifically forms Sep-tRNA Cys , which is then converted to Cys-tRNA Cys by SepCysS. Comparative genomic analyses suggest that this pathway, encoded in all organisms lacking CysRS, can also act as the sole route for cysteine biosynthesis. This was proven for Methanococcus maripaludis , where deletion of the SepRS-encoding gene resulted in cysteine auxotrophy. As the conversions of Sep-tRNA to Cys-tRNA or to selenocysteinyl-tRNA are chemically analogous, the catalytic activity of SepCysS provides a means by which both cysteine and selenocysteine may have originally been added to the genetic code."

In human cells hPOT1 is involved in telomere length regulation, but the mechanism of this regulation remains unknown. Examination of the high-resolution crystal structure of the hPOT1-TTAGGGTTAG complex suggested that it would not be extended by telomerase, a hypothesis that we confirm by <i>in vitro</i> assays with recombinant telomerase. On the other hand, when hPOT1 is bound at a position one telomeric repeat before the 3′-end, leaving an 8-nucleotide 3′-tail, the complex is extended with improved activity and processivity.

By fitting the crystal structure of PspF(1-275) at 1.75 angstroms into the EM map, we identified two loops involved in binding sigma54.

FtsZ plays a prominent role in the division of most bacteria and Archaea assembling into a ring on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane at the site of cell division. It is an ∼40-kDa GTPase with structural homology to eukaryotic tubulin (1Löwe J. Amos L.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 2Romberg L. Levin P.A. Annu. Rev.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) because the protein (from Methanococcus jannaschii) is able to polymerize in the absence of nucleotide. Under different conditions, FtsZ polymers can grow in vitro as straight single-stranded filaments (7Romberg L. Simon M. Erickson H. J. Biol.

Like eukaryotic actin and tubulin, it requires energy provided by nucleotide hydrolysis (2Romberg L. Levin P.A. Annu. Rev.

The apparent cooperativity observed during assembly is not compatible with the existence of linear single-stranded filaments (15Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), although both can be explained by polymer cyclization (16González J.M. Velez M. Jimenez M. Alfonso C.

Finally, it is not known whether polymer growth takes place exclusively at the ends or whether fragmentation and annealing participate in filament dynamics. In the present work, we have used atomic force microscopy (AFM) 1The abbreviation used is: AFM, atomic force microscopy. to study the structure and dynamics of polymer assembly on a mica surface covered by a buffer solution. AFM provides enough spatial resolution to distinguish individual protofilaments in an aqueous environment and has allowed us to observe the polymerization and depolymerization of individual protofilaments. We show that fragmentation and annealing play a role in FtsZ polymer dynamics and that curved and circular single-stranded filaments form from GTP-bound monomers both in solution and on the mica surface. Polymers formed in the presence of non-hydrolyzable nucleotide analogues or in the presence of GDP and aluminum fluoride (AlF3) are structurally similar but showed a slower dynamic behavior, pointing toward a role of GTP hydrolysis in regulating the monomer exchange rate in the filaments. The data presented here provide experimental evidence supporting the model of single-strand polymerization plus cyclization recently proposed to explain the hydrodynamic behavior of the FtsZ polymers in solution (16González J.M. Velez M. Jimenez M. Alfonso C. Schuck P. Mingorance J. Vicente M. Minton A.P. Rivas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Reagents—Guanine nucleotides GDP and GTP were from Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. The nucleotide analogue GMPCPP, which hydrolyzes more slowly than GTP, was purchased from Jena Bioscience. Other analytical grade chemicals were from Merck or Sigma. Protein Purification and Assay—Escherichia coli FtsZ was purified by the calcium-induced precipitation method as described previously (22Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S.

The protein concentration was measured using the BCA assay (Pierce), with spectrophotometrically calibrated FtsZ standards (22Rivas G. Lopez A. Mingorance J. Ferrandiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). GTPase activity was measured by thin layer chromatography, nucleotide exchange was measured with a nitrocellulose filter binding assay, and polymerization was followed by light scattering and electron microscopy using methods described previously (12Mingorance J. Rueda S. Gómez-Puertas P. Valencia A. Vicente M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Formation of AlF3 in solution was done by addition of NaF and AlCl3 to concentrations of 10 mm and 100 μm, respectively. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were done as described previously (16González J.M. Velez M. Jimenez M. Alfonso C. Schuck P. Mingorance J. Vicente M. Minton A.P. Rivas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in a Beckman XL-I ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) at 40,000 rpm and 20 °C. Differential sedimentation coefficient distributions, c(s), were calculated by least squares boundary modeling of sedimentation velocity data using the program SEDFIT (23Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 4D, as in Ref. 16González J.M. Velez M. Jimenez M. Alfonso C. Schuck P. Mingorance J. Vicente M. Minton A.P. Rivas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, correspond to sedimentation coefficients corrected for temperature and buffer composition. Atomic Force Microscopy—Atomic force microscope images were taken with a microscope from Nonatec Electrónica (Madrid, Spain) operated in the jump mode (24Moreno-Herrero F. de Pablo P.J. Fernández-Sánchez R. Colchero J. Gómez-Herrero J. Baró A.M. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2002; 81: 2620-2622Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The scanning piezo was calibrated using silicon calibrating gratings (NT-MDT, Moscow, Russia). Silicon nitride tips (DI Instruments) with a force constant of 0.05 Newton/m were used. A drop of the solution with the FtsZ polymers (formed upon addition of 10 mm GTP to FtsZ protein solutions in Tris 50 mm,pH7,0.5 m KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 buffer) was incubated over freshly cleaved circular pieces of mica glued onto a Teflon surface. After a few minutes, the protein solution was removed, and samples were washed extensively with working buffer and imaged under buffer solution containing 1 mm GTP. Images of the same area were acquired over a period of more than 1 h. To confirm that the imaging itself was not perturbing the dynamic behavior of the polymers, we analyzed regions away from the previously scanned surface and always observed similar changes (images not shown). The thickness of the filaments given was measured at the full width half maximum of each filament profile in order to eliminate the effect of the tip width convolution. At least three different tips were used for the measurements. Structure of FtsZ Filaments—FtsZ polymerization was started in solution by adding GTP or the non-hydrolyzable analogue GMPCPP at neutral pH and high potassium concentration (see “Materials and Methods”). These conditions have been shown previously to produce maximal polymerization as measured by light scattering and maximal GTPase activity, while minimizing the degree of oligomer formation by FtsZ-GDP. The reactions were placed over freshly cleaved circular mica pieces, and after a few minutes, the reaction mixture was exchanged by buffer, and the protein adsorbed to the mica surface was observed with the atomic force microscope in a liquid environment (Fig. 1). The concentration of FtsZ was varied between 0.5 and 0.01 mg/ml. At the highest concentrations, the excess of protein made observations difficult, whereas at the lowest concentrations, isolated short filaments were observed. At a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml, a dense layer of continuous polymers containing straight and curved segments was observed. The filaments had a trend to align and aggregate laterally into bundles and covered most of the mica surface, indicating that they were not simply adsorbed to the mica but that they rearranged and adapted to fill the entire available surface. The thickness of the filaments was measured from surfaces with a low density of filaments (Fig. 1A) (see “Materials and Methods”), in which the height was measured to be 4 nm, and on densely packed surfaces (Fig. 1B), in which the tip could not penetrate to reach the mica surface, and the width was measured as the distance between adjacent filaments. In both cases, the width measurements are only compatible with single-strand filaments forming a single layer of proteins on the mica surface. Dynamics of Individual FtsZ Filaments—FtsZ filaments formed in solution in the presence of GTP were layered on mica and observed under a buffer solution containing 1 mm GTP. When the protein solution is replaced by the buffer, the concentration of the remaining monolayer of protein is very low, in the nanomolar range, resulting in a slow GTP consumption rate that provides enough time to image the depolymerization process. During the reaction, the filaments were dynamic and grew, shrunk and redistributed continuously over the surface. After some time, net depolymerization led to a decrease in the density of the material deposited and curved filaments of smaller radius were formed. Fig. 2 shows representative images of a sequence that documented every 2 min the evolution of the reaction (the complete sequence assembled in a movie can be found in Supplemental material). Examination of the images provides information regarding the mechanism by which the restructuring of the filaments takes place. We observe fragmentation of some filaments that eventually reanneal, constituting a new filament (Fig. 3A); formation of filament bundles by lateral interaction of independent filaments (Fig. 3B); and cyclization of filaments (Fig. 3C). The radius of curvature of the filaments is variable, and from the length of the circles and the monomer size, we estimate that the angle between monomers is within the range of 1° to 6°. FtsZ Polymer Dynamics in the Presence of GDP-AlF3—To investigate the role of nucleotide hydrolysis in the curvature and dynamics of the polymers, we used AlF3. This compound is a high affinity analogue of the γ-phosphate of GTP at the active site of G proteins and microtubules (17Carlier M.F. Didry D. Melki R. Chabre M. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3628Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 18Bigay J. Deterre P. Pfister C. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2907-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and inhibits the GTPase activity of FtsZ (19RayChaudhuri D. Park J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22941-22944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We looked at the nucleotide exchange rate and the stability and structure of the filaments when GTP was replaced by the GDP-AlF3 complex. We have previously shown that the nucleotide turnover of FtsZ polymers is very fast (12Mingorance J. Rueda S. Gómez-Puertas P. Valencia A. Vicente M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), reflecting not only GDP/GTP exchange after GTP hydrolysis but also that the GTP-binding site is open to the reaction solution (6Huecas S. Andreu J.M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Mingorance J. Rueda S. Gómez-Puertas P. Valencia A. Vicente M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Oliva M.A. Cordell S.C. Löwe J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To study the effect of AlF3 on the nucleotide exchange dynamics, [α-32P]GTP was added to the reaction mix and left for several minutes to obtain [α-32P]GDP-bound FtsZ, and then AlF3 was added, the nucleotide was chased with an excess of cold GDP, and the bound nucleotide was measured with a nitrocellulose binding assay (12Mingorance J. Rueda S. Gómez-Puertas P. Valencia A. Vicente M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that most of the label is chased by an excess of unlabeled GTP in a few seconds, irrespective of the polymerization state of the protein. In the presence of AlF3, ∼70% of the label remained bound to the protein after 10 min (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the GDP-AlF3 has high affinity for the nucleotide-binding site and blocks the nucleotide exchange, consequently inhibiting GTP hydrolysis. The polymerization of FtsZ in the presence of AlF3 was studied by light scattering (Fig. 4B). The protein was incubated at 25 °C with fresh GDP in polymerization buffer. Addition of AlF3 induced a rapid polymerization that remained stable for at least 30 min. The same finding was observed when the protein was incubated with GTP, and the AlF3 was added after the protein had polymerized and depolymerized completely. Polymerization was not induced by AlF3 in the absence of nucleotide, and neither NaF nor AlCl3 alone induced polymerization, indicating that the complex AlF3 binds to FtsZ-GDP and that the bound GDP-AlF3 is a high affinity analogue of GTP that induces polymerization but cannot be exchanged, and therefore the polymers formed are stable. The apparent critical concentration of the polymerization reaction in the presence of GDP and AlF3 was calculated from the light scattering signal obtained at different FtsZ concentrations (Fig. 4C). The critical concentration obtained was 2 μm, which is not very different from the concentrations measured in previous works (∼1 μm) (10González J.M. Jimenez M. Velez M. Mingorance J. Andreu J.M. Vicente M. Rivas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37664-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), indicating that AlF3 binding does not alter the affinity between protein subunits. We have previously found by sedimentation velocity that in the presence of GTP (and a GTP regenerating system), FtsZ polymers sediment as a sharp peak that indicates that they have a size limit and are relatively homogeneous (16González J.M. Velez M. Jimenez M. Alfonso C. Schuck P. Mingorance J. Vicente M. Minton A.P. Rivas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similar sedimentation velocity behavior has been found in the case of FtsZ polymers induced by binding of GDP and AlF3. At low FtsZ concentrations, several peaks were seen, ranging from low to high sedimentation coefficients, whereas at higher concentrations, most of the protein concentrates into a single sharp peak with a sedimentation coefficient comparable to the fast-sedimenting peak previously observed in the presence of GTP (Fig. 4D). Curvature of FtsZ Filaments in the Presence of GDP-AlF3— The polymers formed in the presence of AlF3 were studied by electron microscopy and AFM (Fig. 5). Electron micrographs showed that the polymers were thin, apparently single-stranded filaments 5.6 ± 0.1 nm wide (n = 51) that formed circular and curved structures similar to those observed in GTP at low protein concentrations (16González J.M. Velez M. Jimenez M. Alfonso C. Schuck P. Mingorance J. Vicente M. Minton A.P. Rivas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). AFM images also showed curved and circular structures, with a tendency to interact laterally, indistinguishable from the structures formed in the presence of GTP. The difference, however, was observed in their higher stability because the structures remained relatively stable for up to 30 min (Fig. 5B), as compared with the highly dynamic behavior observed in the GTP polymers shown in Fig. 2. The atomic force microscope has allowed us to visualize and follow the growth and depolymerization of individual FtsZ protofilaments on a mica surface kept under buffer solution. We have obtained information about two functionally relevant traits of FtsZ polymers: 1) the assembly/disassembly processes and 2) their tendency to form curved structures. Dynamic Restructuring and Flexibility—Filaments polymerized in solution and adsorbed onto mica covered the surface with a network of continuous individual and highly flexible filaments. A strong tendency to align laterally and to aggregate into transient bundles was observed (Fig. 1), suggesting the presence of lateral interactions. The 4-nm filament height measured corresponds well with the crystal structure dimensions (1Löwe J. Amos L.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar), indicating that under our imaging conditions, the interaction with the mica and the imaging tip did not significantly deform the protein (Fig. 1). GTP consumption was accompanied by a continuous restructuring of the filaments. The observed behavior is better explained considering the filaments as linear polymers of interacting monomers, all having the potential to dissociate from neighboring monomers. There are two distinctive characteristics of the FtsZ polymers that could explain why this mechanism is energetically possible: 1) FtsZ filaments are single-stranded, and 2) single-stranded FtsZ polymers consist largely of GTP-bound subunits (12Mingorance J. Rueda S. Gómez-Puertas P. Valencia A. Vicente M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For single-stranded filaments, the energetic difference between dissociating a monomer from the end and dissociating it from the interior is the difference between breaking one or two energetically equivalent bonds. For double- or multi-stranded filaments, this difference is larger, given the multiple interactions of the internal monomers. For single-stranded filaments, the balance between GTP hydrolysis and rapid GDP/GTP exchange along the filament (12Mingorance J. Rueda S. Gómez-Puertas P. Valencia A. Vicente M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Romberg L. Mitchison T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Huecas S. Andreu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46146-46154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) could produce transient and labile monomer interactions that could make inner monomer dissociation as energetically feasible as dissociation of end monomers. Fig. 3A points out individual episodes of protofilament rearrangement showing fragmentation due to dissociation between internal monomers and reannealing with adjacent filaments providing experimental support for this interpretation. The highly dynamic and plastic behavior observed in the filaments is therefore explained through a versatile and flexible mechanism for polymerization allowed for in single-stranded filaments capable of fragmenting at any point and reannealing with adjacent filaments. Fragmentation of polymer filaments might be important to determine polymer dynamics either in solution or on a surface. In contrast, reannealing with other filaments is more likely to be relevant for surface dynamics, whereas in solution, self-annealing inducing cyclization might be favored. The more static behavior of filaments formed in the presence of GDP-AlF3 suggests that the energy provided by nucleotide hydrolysis is relevant in maintaining the dynamism underlying the observed structural plasticity of the filaments, as has been suggested previously (6Huecas S. Andreu J.M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Polymer Curvature—The second issue addressed in this work is the nucleotide dependence of the filament curvature. We observe curved filaments in all conditions explored: 1) in the presence of an excess of GTP (where, given the biochemical evidence that most monomers in the polymer are GTP-bound, we can assume that at any moment only a small number of monomers have GDP); 2) in the presence of GMPCPP (low hydrolyzing nucleotide; therefore, a low rate of GDP formation and presumably a low GDP-monomer concentration); the curvatures observed in both of the above conditions are smooth and not kinked, as would be expected if the curvature was only induced at the points of insertion of GDP monomers in the filaments; and 3) in the presence of AlF3. The GDP-AlF3 complex is a high affinity (non-exchangeable) analogue of GDP-Pi that is anchored in the GTP-binding site. We can therefore assume that under these conditions, there are no GDP-bound monomers present in the filaments and that the curved filaments observed are constituted by monomers that mimic the GTP-bound conformation. The range of angles between monomers we observed is different from the larger angle needed for the formation of previously described mini-rings of about 25 nm in diameter (9Erickson H. Taylor D. Taylor K.A. Bramhill D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The curved structures we observe are, however, well within the range of diameters compatible with the cellular dimensions during the constriction that leads to cell division. The operation of lateral interactions between existing protofilaments can also be inferred from our results as being relevant for determining the higher order structures of the polymers (Fig. 3B). We had previously reported that the presence of crowding agents to mimic the high excluded volume present in the interior of the living cell induced higher order polymer structures that are compatible with the existence of these lateral interactions (10González J.M.

Until now, the existence of single-stranded filaments had been difficult to reconcile with the cooperative polymerization behavior observed in vitro (15Chen Y. Bjornson K. Redick S.D. Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, recent experimental evidence from analytical centrifugation has led us to propose an isodesmic polymerization plus cyclization model that explains the cooperative behavior earlier attributed only to the formation of double-stranded filaments (16González J.M. Velez M. Jimenez M. Alfonso C. Schuck P. Mingorance J. Vicente M. Minton A.P. Rivas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1895-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The highly flexible and circular single-stranded filaments formed in the presence of GTP or GDP-AlF3 described in this work provide further experimental support to the proposed polymerization model. In summary, we have observed that curved single-stranded filaments form in the presence of GTP at neutral pH and high ionic strength, supporting the recently proposed isodesmic cyclization model. We have also provided direct evidence that fragmentation and reannealing, two processes that affect the assembly kinetics, occur in FtsZ filaments on a surface. This behavior might be relevant for the dynamic assembly of the FtsZ ring on the inner cell membrane during bacterial cell division.

https://openalex.org/W1991964259,"Physiologic sites for inhaled anesthetics are presumed to be cavities within transmembrane 4-alpha-helix bundles of neurotransmitter receptors, but confirmation of binding and structural detail of such sites remains elusive. To provide such detail, we screened soluble proteins containing this structural motif, and found only one that exhibited evidence of strong anesthetic binding. Ferritin is a 24-mer of 4-alpha-helix bundles; both halothane and isoflurane bind with K(A) values of approximately 10(5) M(-1), higher than any previously reported inhaled anesthetic-protein interaction. The crystal structures of the halothane/apoferritin and isoflurane/apoferritin complexes were determined at 1.75 A resolution, revealing a common anesthetic binding pocket within an interhelical dimerization interface. The high affinity is explained by several weak polar contacts and an optimal host/guest packing relationship. Neither the acidic protons nor ether oxygen of the anesthetics contribute to the binding interaction. Compared with unliganded apoferritin, the anesthetic produced no detectable alteration of structure or B factors. The remarkably high affinity of the anesthetic/apoferritin complex implies greater selectivity of protein sites than previously thought, and suggests that direct protein actions may underlie effects at lower than surgical levels of anesthetic, including loss of awareness."

https://openalex.org/W2158427090,"Inflammation in the brain has increasingly been recognized to play an important role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Progress in the search for effective therapeutic strategies that can halt this degenerative process remains limited. We previously showed that micromolar concentrations of dextromethorphan (DM), a major ingredient of widely used antitussive remedies, reduced the inflammation-mediated degeneration of dopaminergic neurons through the inhibition of microglial activation. In this study, we report that femto- and micromolar concentrations of DM (both pre- and post-treatment) showed equal efficacy in protecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced dopaminergic neuron death in midbrain neuron-glia cultures. Both concentrations of DM decreased LPS-induced release of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, prostaglandin E2 and superoxide from microglia in comparable degrees. The important role of superoxide was demonstrated by DM's failure to show a neuroprotective effect in neuron-glia cultures from NADPH oxidase-deficient mice. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effect elicited by femtomolar concentrations of DM is mediated through the inhibition of LPS-induced proinflammatory factors, especially superoxide. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic concept of using ""ultra-low"" drug concentrations for the intervention of inflammation-related neurodegenerative diseases."

As a member of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family of homodimeric flavoenzymes, each subunit of GR contains one FAD, two substrate binding sites, and, in oxidized GR(Eox), an intramolecular disulfide. During the reductive half-reaction electrons are transferred rapidly from NADPH on the re side of the flavin to the cystine disulfide on the si side of the flavin. In the oxidative half-reaction the final electron acceptor GSSG is reduced to 2 GSH, regenerating the disulfide at the active site of GR. Under physiological, reducing conditions GR(EH2) presumably occurs as the principal species of the enzyme in vivo (8Böhme C.C. Arscott L.D. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Williams Jr., C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37317-37323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The flow of electrons during a catalytic cycle can be monitored by specific spectral changes, using the flavin as an inherent redox indicator. The reductive half-reaction is characterized by a loss of absorbance at 460 nm coupled to a slight blue shift of the local maximum. In addition, the absorbance at 540 nm increases because of the formation of a thiolate-FAD charge-transfer complex (CTC), formed between the flavin and the proximal or charge-transfer thiolate of Cys63 in hGR. Cys58 in hGR provides the interchange or distal thiol that forms a mixed disulfide with glutathione as an intermediate. Reoxidation of the enzyme, which is coupled to the formation of GSH during the oxidative half-reaction, reverses the spectral changes (3Krauth-Siegel R.L. Arscott L.D. Schönleben-Janas A.

Phospholes are phosphacyclopentadienes that have very limited aromatic character (for an example, see the central unit of the compound shown in Fig. 1) and a nucleophilic phosphorus atom, which makes them good reagents for chemical modifications, for example, with thiols (16Hay C.

Thus, they are interesting candidates for inhibitor studies on disulfide reductases such as thioredoxin reductase and GR because they exhibit inhibitor concentrations for 50% inhibition (I0.5) in the lower micromolar range (15Irmler A.

Here, we describe a novel, highly potent gold-phosphole inhibitor (GoPI) of hGR.

We propose a mechanism for the reaction of GoPI with hGR based on studies using mass spectrometry, titrations, stopped-flow kinetics, and steady-state kinetics. The potential of GoPI as a lead compound for the development of novel anti-tumor drugs was confirmed by first experiments with glioblastoma cells cultured in vitro.

Steady-state Kinetics and Inhibition Studies—Steady-state kinetics were monitored spectrophotometrically at 25 °C using a Hitachi U-2001 or a Beckmann DU 650 UV-visual spectrophotometer. All experiments were performed in the presence of the same concentration of DMF without inhibitor as a control. The type of inhibition was characterized by analyzing Km values for GSSG in the presence of GoPI or PPh3AuCl, and for NADPH in the presence of GoPI. All reactions were started by the addition of NADPH unless otherwise described. To determine the half-maximal inhibition of hGR by GoPI in comparison with other disulfide reductase inhibitors (I0.5), 1.4 or 2.8 nm hGR was incubated for 10 min with 100 μm NADPH and 0.5–10 nm GoPI or 10–100 nm PPh3AuCl, respectively. Then, 100 μm GSSG was added, and the residual activity of hGR was measured. Alternatively, hGR was incubated with GoPI for 10 min in the absence of NADPH, followed by addition of NADPH and GSSG. Time-dependent inactivation of hGR by GoPI was analyzed under two sets of conditions: first, as described by Kitz and Wilson (21Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was to preincubate 0.1 μm NADPH-reduced hGR with 1–3-fold excess GoPI at 4 °C. Higher concentrations of GoPI lead to complete and very rapid inactivation of hGR, which prevented measurement. Aliquots of 5 μl were taken after 0.5–10 min and used for measuring the residual activity at 25 °C in a 500-μl assay mixture. Second, 1.7 nm NADPH-reduced hGR at 25 °C was incubated with inhibitor (1.7–5.0 nm). After various intervals (0.5–10 min) of incubation, the enzymatic activity was measured by adding 1 mm GSSG to the mixture and compared with that of an untreated control. Based on this second approach a second-order rate constant of the reaction between enzyme and inhibitor was determined from the equation, d[E]/dt = k[E][I] (22Davioud-Charvet E. McLeish M.J. Veine D.M. Giegel D. Arscott L.D. Andricopulo A.D. Becker K. Müller S. Schirmer R.H. Williams Jr., C.H. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13319-13330Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Titration and Rapid Reaction Experiments—Titrations were carried out at 25 °C and stopped-flow measurements at 4 °C. To produce hGR(EH2) in the absence of NADP(H), NaBH4 was added at a ∼50-fold molar excess over hGR(Eox) (7Rietveld P. Arscott L.D. Berry A. Scrutton N.S. Deonarain M.P. Perham R.N. Williams Jr., C.H.

Salt concentrations and pH of the GR buffer do not change significantly after addition of the NaBH4-containing solution (<4% v/v); excess NaBH4 is degraded rapidly at pH 6.9 (7Rietveld P.

Titration of Oxidized and Reduced hGR with GoPI—Oxidized enzyme was titrated (in duplicate) with 0–10 eq of GoPI under aerobic conditions (initial concentration of enzyme was 9.6 or 9.7 μm, the final concentration of DMF was 1.8 or 1.6%, v/v). For each experiment GR buffer was titrated with inhibitor as a reference. In a control experiment hGR was titrated with DMF without GoPI, and the spectra and specific enzymatic activity were not affected significantly up to a concentration of 2.7% (v/v). NaBH4-reduced hGR(EH2) was titrated with 0–1.1 eq of inhibitor under anaerobic conditions (initial concentration of enzyme was 16.6 μm, final concentration of DMF was 2.7%, v/v). At the end of the titration, the protein solution was washed repeatedly in a Centricon 30 (Millipore) and assayed for specific activity to test the reversibility of the inhibition. Reduction of hGR(Eox) after Preincubation with GoPI—Oxidized enzyme (8.2 μm) was incubated aerobically with 10 eq of inhibitor, followed by titration with 0–11.3 eq of NADPH (0–88 μm) under anaerobic conditions. At the end of the titration, the protein solution was washed repeatedly in Centricon 30 to attempt to remove the inhibitor. Alternatively, 16.3 μm hGR(Eox) was incubated with 1.25 eq of GoPI, followed by a reduction with 0–20 eq of NaBH4 under aerobic conditions. GR buffer containing only the inhibitor was treated identically and served as a spectral control. Reactivity of GoPI with Dithiothreitol, GSH, and Bovine Serum Albumin—To analyze spectral changes of GoPI in the presence of different thiols, solutions of 15–20 μm inhibitor in GR buffer were incubated for 10 min with 10 eq of GSH or dithiothreitol. In addition, GoPI was added to a solution containing 48 μm (2.4 eq) bovine serum albumin, and incubated for 10 min. Rapid Reaction Kinetics—Rapid reaction kinetics of the oxidative half-reaction were measured under anaerobic conditions in the diode array mode in a Hi-Tech SF-61DX2 stopped-flow photometer (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, Wiltshire, United Kingdom). The reaction was initiated by mixing equal volumes of substrate and NaBH4-reduced enzyme (preincubated with or without GoPI) in the stopped-flow instrument: in a series of control experiments the first syringe was loaded with 28.1 μm hGR(EH2), and the second syringe was loaded with GR buffer containing 0, 30, 60, 120, or 600 μm GSSG. Afterward, 0.9 eq of GoPI was added to hGR(EH2) in the first syringe (0.86% DMF, v/v) and mixed again with 0, 30, 60, 120, or 600 μm GSSG. Finally, GoPI was added to the enzyme-containing solution at an excess over hGR (∼2.4 eq, ∼3% DMF, v/v) and mixed with 600 μm GSSG. The data from kinetic traces at selected wavelengths were fitted to single exponential functions using the software KinetAsyst3 (Hi-Tech Scientific). Molecular Modeling—GoPI was manually built with GaussView (Gaussian, Inc.). The geometry of the molecule was subsequently refined by molecular mechanics methods using the UFF force field. GoPI was manually fitted to the active site of hGR (5Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) with the program O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) and refined with the program CNS (25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16949) Google Scholar). SELDI-TOF MS—Purified hGR was analyzed on NP20 Protein-Chip® Arrays (normal phase, hydrophilic properties; Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc.) to detect masses of untreated hGR(Eox) compared with enzyme after pre-reduction with NADPH and incubation with GoPI. Each sample was prepared in triplicate. GR (85 μm) was reduced with 50 eq of NADPH and then incubated with 1 or 10 eq of GoPI for 30 min at room temperature. The resulting solution was diluted 1:100 in double-distilled water and 1 μl of each sample (0.85 pmol) was applied directly to NP20 ProteinChip® Array spots, which were prewetted with 1 μl of double-distilled water. The array surface was allowed to dry for 30 min, and was washed twice with 5 μl of double-distilled water to remove residual salt. Saturated sinapinic acid solution (1 μl 50%) dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid was added and air-dried twice. Subsequently, mass analysis of bound hGR was performed using the ProteinChip Reader (PBS IIc, Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc.). The ProteinChip Arrays were analyzed by averaging 100 laser shots collected in the positive ion mode. The accelerating potential was +20 kV and the extraction delay time was set to 1620 ns. Deflector settings were used to filter out peaks with m/z <8000. Calibration was performed with the following proteins: bovine β-lactoglobulin A (18,363 Da), horseradish peroxidase (43,240 Da), bovine serum albumin (66,433 Da), and chicken conalbumin (77,490 Da). Proliferation Assays—Cell cultures of glioblastoma cells NCH37, NCH82, and NCH89 were established in our laboratory (26Herold-Mende C. Steiner H.H. Andl T. Riede D. Buttler A. Reisser C. Fusenig N.E. Mueller M.M. Lab. Investig. 1999; 79: 1573-1582PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured routinely in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% air in a humidified incubator with medium changes twice a week. After reaching confluence, cells were harvested by a brief incubation with a trypsin/EDTA solution (Viralex, PAA, Linz, Austria) and seeded into a fresh 75-cm2 plastic tissue culture flask. Proliferation assays were performed as described earlier (26Herold-Mende C. Steiner H.H. Andl T. Riede D. Buttler A. Reisser C. Fusenig N.E. Mueller M.M. Lab. Investig. 1999; 79: 1573-1582PubMed Google Scholar) using the BrdU Labeling and Detection Kit III (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Cells were seeded in 8 replicas in 96-well plates into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics, each well receiving 7 × 103 cells. After 24 h GoPI was added at different concentrations (1, 5, 10, and 20 μm). 48 h later, 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine was added to the wells at a final concentration of 100 μm. The 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation assay was processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mean value of the absorbance of the control samples containing no GoPI was defined as 100% proliferation rate. All values are means of at least two independent experiments (each comprising 8 replicas). Chemical Properties of GoPI—GoPI is a symmetric aromatic phosphole-gold complex (Fig. 1), which is stable at room temperature. The phosphorus atom behaves as a classical 2-electron donor toward the gold(I) atom (18Fave C. Cho T.Y. Hissler M. Chen C.W. Luh T.Y. Wu C.C. Réau R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9254-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The simplicity of the 13C NMR spectra recorded in solution is in favor of a symmetric structure. However, theoretical calculations and modeling of the structure predict a low energy barrier for the pyridyl rings to rotate around the C-C bonds connecting them to the phosphole ring (16Hay C. Hissler M. Fischmeister C. Rault-Berthelot J. Toupet L. Nyulaszi L. Réau R. Chem. Eur. J. 2001; 7: 4222-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It is thus very likely that this dynamic process is rapid in solution at room temperature. Steady-state Kinetics—Inhibition of hGR(Eox) by GoPI is competitive for GSSG at high concentrations of inhibitor (Fig. 2): all straight lines in the Lineweaver-Burk plot intersect at the ordinate with almost identical Vmax values, and plots of [GSSG]/ν against [GoPI] lead to predominantly parallel lines when using data points for 0.01, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 μm GoPI. The Kic is 0.46 μm (for competitive inhibition of pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases, see for example Ref. 10Becker K. Herold-Mende C. Park J.J. Lowe G. Schirmer R.H. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 2784-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), calculated using the equation Kic = Km[GoPI]/(Km ′ - Km) for 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 μm GoPI. Km ′ is the apparent Michaelis constant in the presence of inhibitor obtained from the x axis intercepts of the Lineweaver-Burk plots. The Km for GSSG in the absence of inhibitor is 71 μm. Km for NADPH (4.4–5.6 μm) was not significantly changed in the presence of 0.65–2.5 μm inhibitor (data not shown). In contrast to the competition with GSSG that was observed at high inhibitor concentrations, only ∼1 nm GoPI was sufficient to inactivate 50% of 1.4 nm NADPH-reduced hGR, when hGR was preincubated for 10 min with GoPI. Preincubating oxidized hGR with inhibitor in the absence of NADPH for 10 min requires 6.2 nm inhibitor to achieve 50% inactivation. Time-dependent Inactivation—GoPI also inhibits hGR irreversibly in a time-dependent process. The inactivation of GoPI was monitored over a period of 10 min using two different preincubation protocols as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the first approach enzyme activity decreased with pseudo first-order kinetics (kapp = kinact[I]0/(Ki + [I]0), see also Refs. 21Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 27Bisswanger H. Enzymkinetik. 3rd Ed. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim2000Crossref Google Scholar), and was dependent on the inhibitor concentration (data not shown). The maximal rate constant for inhibition in the presence of excess inhibitor (kinact) was ∼1.2 min-1,"

The number (n) of isoprene units in the polyprenyl tail (Qn) is distinct in different organisms; humans produce Q10, Caenorhabditis elegans Q9, Escherichia coli Q8, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Q6. Within the inner mitochondrial membrane Q functions in respiratory electron transport, where it transfers two electrons from either complex I or complex II to complex III (1Dutton P.L. Ohnishi T.

Q is present in almost all organisms, with the quantity roughly matching the respiratory capability of the tissue from which it is isolated (2Crane F.L. Morton R.A. Biochemistry of Quinones. 1. Academic Press, London1965: 183-206Google Scholar). In addition to this role, Q has been found to act as a chain-breaking antioxidant (3Kagan V.E. Nohl H. Quinn P.J. Cadenas E. Packer L. Handbook of Antioxidants. Marcel Dekker, New York1996: 157-201Google Scholar) and to be involved in the electron transport chains of plasma and lysosomal membranes (4Santos-Ocana C. Cordoba F.

Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 473-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As observed with other redox active compounds, Q has the potential to act as a source of oxidative stress. In certain species, the amount of reactive oxygen species generated by mitochondria has been related to Q content (9Lass A. Agarwal S. Sohal R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19199-19204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Nakai D. Shimizu T. Nojiri H. Uchiyama S. Koike H. Takahashi M. Hirokawa K. Shirasawa T. Aging Cell. 2004; 3: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These described dual roles as antioxidant and prooxidant associate Q with both extended and shortened life spans. C. elegans fed E. coli diets lacking Q8, and C. elegans clk-1 mutants with defects in Q biosynthesis show increased life spans, and we have proposed that the decreased levels of Q are associated with a decreased level of the Q semiquinone radical ( (Q−˙)) and a decreased propensity to produce superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (11Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Science. 2002; 295: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 12Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Faull K.F. Clarke C.F. Larsen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45020-45027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, supplementation of the E. coli Q8-replete diet with Q10 leads to enhanced life span in C. elegans (13Ishii N. Senoo-Matsuda N. Miyake K. Yasuda K. Ishii T. Hartman P.S. Furukawa S. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2004; 125: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The mechanisms producing these different life span outcomes are unknown. Many of the gene products required for Q biosynthesis have been identified in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (14Meganathan R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 131-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Turunen M. Olsson J. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1660: 171-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Yeast mutants with defects in Q biosynthesis (the coq mutants) have provided a valuable system for understanding eukaryotic Q biosynthesis (16Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2001: 185-208Google Scholar). The functions of the Coq polypeptides identified so far include synthesis of the polyprenyl diphosphate tail (Coq1) and its transfer to the benzoquinone precursor 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (Coq2), and subsequent ring modifications (Coq3, Coq5, Coq6, and Coq7/Clk-1) (Fig. 1). Two Coq polypeptides, Coq4 and Coq8, are essential for Q biosynthesis but function in an unknown manner (18Belogrudov G.I. Lee P.T. Jonassen T. Hsu A.Y. Gin P. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem.

Yeast strains harboring null mutations in coq3, coq4, coq5, coq6, coq7, or coq8 accumulate the first lipid-associated intermediate 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HHB) (Fig. 1) (20Poon W.W.

Biophys. 1995; 320: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This lipid intermediate is detected after metabolic labeling with the dedicated precursor 4-[U-14C]hydroxybenzoic acid. When the orthologous genes are mutated in E. coli, more distinct intermediates characteristic of each blocked step accumulate (22Gibson F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1973; 1: 317-326Crossref Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the difference in the accumulation of Q intermediates between E. coli and yeast is that in yeast the Coq polypeptides assemble into a multisubunit complex necessary to perform each of the steps subsequent to formation of HHB. This prediction is supported by the presence of DMQ6 (2-hexaprenyl-6-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, Fig. 1) (23Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol.

Recently, we have observed a co-dependence between the COQ gene products and the stability of Coq3p, Coq4p, and Coq6p (25Gin P. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2676-2681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Each of the coq -null mutants showed decreased steady-state levels of Coq3p, Coq4p, and Coq6p; however, levels of Coq1p and Coq5p were not affected. Hsu et al. (26Hsu A.Y. Do T.Q. Lee P.T. Clarke C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) showed that O-methyltransferase activity was decreased in the coq-null mutants relative to respiratory deficient control mutants (atp2, cor1). COQ3 mRNA levels were constant, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. The decrease in Coq3p, Coq4p, and Coq6p levels observed in the coq mutants may thus be caused by their degradation secondary to a destabilized Coq multisubunit complex(es). Of the eight proteins involved in the biosynthesis of Q in S. cerevisiae, five have been identified as mitochondrial matrix proteins peripherally associated with the inner membrane (18Belogrudov G.I.

At the present time the submitochondrial localization of Coq2p has not been characterized, but it has been proposed to contain four transmembrane domains based on hydropathy predictions (32Ashby M.N.

Schatz G. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here we characterize the yeast Q-biosynthetic complex. Coq3p is a key polypeptide component of the proposed complex because it functions in both an early step and the last step of Q biosynthesis (27Poon W.W. Barkovich R.J. Hsu A.Y. Frankel A. Lee P.T.

The enzymatic assay for Coq3p methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.114), converting DMeQ3H2 (2-farnesyl-5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinol) to Q3H2 (Fig. 1), provides a surrogate for Q biosynthesis and complex activity. In this study, detergent solubilization of mitochondria, Blue Native (BN)-PAGE analyses, size exclusion chromatography, and avidin capture of biotinylated Coq3 provide the first physical evidence of interactions between Coq polypeptides and identify Coq3p and Coq4p as defining members of a Q-biosynthetic Coq polypeptide complex. Yeast Strains and Materials—Yeast strains (Table I) were grown at 30 °C in YPGal medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% galactose, 0.1% dextrose) prepared as described previously (34Burke D.

Open table in a new tab Mitochondrial Isolation and Solubilization—Yeast cultures were grown to an A600 nm of 3–4, and mitochondria were isolated and purified on nycodenz gradients as described previously (35Glick P.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), except that mitochondria were collected from the interface of the 14%/20% step gradient. Mitochondria were stored frozen as 1–2-mg aliquots as described but without bovine serum albumin. Nycodenz-purified mitochondria were solubilized as described previously (36Schagger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 231-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 2 mg of mitochondria was solubilized in 200 μl of 2% digitonin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.6 mm Pefabloc/AEBSF (Sigma), and 0.39 mg/ml protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. Alternatively, the digitonin/protein ratio was adjusted as described. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation in a Beckman Airfuge (100,000 × g, 10 min, chilled centrifuge tubes and rotor), and the supernatant was collected. Proteins were assayed by BCA assay (Pierce), with standards and samples in 0.2% Triton X-100 as a diluent. Gel Filtration Analyses—Gel filtration was performed as described previously (37Cruciat C.M. Brunner S. Baumann F. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The supernatant from 2 mg of digitonin-solubilized mitochondria (200 μl) was applied to a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and eluted (0.40 ml/min) with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05% digitonin. Fractions (0.6 ml) were collected and analyzed for O-methyltransferase activity, quinone content by mass spectroscopy, and for Coq protein content by immunoblot. Calibration standards (Amersham Biosciences) were as follows: thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; ferritin, 440 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; and ribonuclease A, 13.7 kDa. BN-PAGE—BN-PAGE was performed as described previously (36Schagger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 231-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 5–13.5% or 6–16% gradient gels, except that gel volumes were decreased to use the Bio-Rad mini gel format. First dimension gels were 1 mm thick. Special combs (polystyrene, 1.5 mm thick, Orange County Industrial Plastics, Anaheim, CA) were made by the UCLA physics machine shop for casting the preparative well and included three separate lanes for molecular mass standards and control yeast extracts in the second dimension analysis. First dimension gel slices were soaked in 500 μl of 65 °C 2× SDS sample buffer for 10 min before loading onto pre-cast 10–13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205522) Google Scholar). Proteins were routinely blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the dyes removed by serial immersion in 100% methanol prior to blocking in 1% nonfat milk, phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. Detection of proteins was by ECL using Super Signal West Pico (Pierce) and luminescence detected by VersaDoc image processing software (Bio-Rad). Immunoblot Analysis—Equal aliquots (200 μl) of each gel filtration fraction were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%) and resuspended in 25 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and 25 μl of 2× sample buffer. 10 μl of each fraction was loaded on a 12% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore). Immunoblot analysis and treatment of membranes for re-use with another antiserum were performed as described by Schleicher & Schuell. An exception to the stated protocol was the use of washing buffer: 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibodies were used at the following concentrations: anti-Coq1p, 1:10,000; anti-Coq3p, 1:1,000; anti-Coq4p, 1:1,000; anti-Coq5p, 1:5,000; anti-Coq6p, 1:500; anti-Rip1p, 1:10,000; and anti-IDH, 1:5,000. Goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem) were each used at a 1:10,000 dilution. Synthesis of DMeQ3—An improved synthesis of DMeQ3 was developed. Fumagatin was prepared in three steps from 3,4,5-trimethoxytoluene using slight modifications of previously published procedures (27Poon W.W. Barkovich R.J. Hsu A.Y. Frankel A. Lee P.T. Shepherd J.N.

Soc. 1941; 63: 670-672Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). DMeQ3 was prepared from fumagatin using farnesyltrimethyl stannane and BF3·OEt2 at –78 °C in CH2Cl2, followed by oxidation with Ag2O in Et2O (40Matarasso-Tchiroukhine E. Cadiot P. J. Organomet. Chem. 1976; 121: 155-168Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 41Naruta Y. J. Org. Chem. 1980; 45: 4097-4104Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The synthetic scheme is depicted in Fig. 2. 2-Hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxy-6-methylacetophenone (1)—Under an argon atmosphere, aluminum chloride (11 g, 82 mmol) was dissolved in Et2O (32 ml). Acetyl chloride (2.1 ml, 30 mmol) was added followed by the addition of 3,4,5-trimethoxytoluene (4.6 ml, 27 mmol). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min and then quenched with H2O. The resulting mixture was brought to pH 1 with concentrated HCl and extracted with Et2O. The organic layers were combined and extracted with 1 m NaOH. The aqueous layers were then combined and adjusted to pH 1 as before, extracted with Et2O, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo to obtain compound 1 (3.8 g, 65% yield). 2-Hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxy-6-methylphenol (2)—All necessary glassware was soaked overnight in 0.1 m aqueous NaOH and 0.1 m H2O2 prior to the reaction. Compound 1 (5.00 g, 23.8 mmol) and NaOH (19.0 g, 47.6 mmol) were dissolved in 75 ml of H2O. A solution of 6.0 ml of 30% H2O2 and 90 ml of H2O was transferred to the reaction flask, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min. Concentrated HCl was added to quench the reaction until pH 3 was reached. This solution was extracted with EtOAc, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. Flash chromatography (8:2 Hex/EtOAc) using silica gel provided compound 2 (3.7 g, 85%). 2-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (3) (Fumagatin)— Cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (7.40 g, 13.6 mmol) and 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (2.30 g, 13.6 mmol) were dissolved in 25 ml of 1:1 CH3CN/H2O and cooled to 0 °C. This solution was added to compound 2 (1.00 g, 5.40 mmol), which had been dissolved in 25 ml of 7:3 CH3CN/H2O and cooled to 0 °C. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min, quenched with H2O, and extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic layers were combined and rinsed with saturated NaHCO3. The aqueous layers were then combined and adjusted to pH 3 with concentrated HCl. This solution was extracted with CH2Cl2, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo to give fumagatin (0.50 g, 55% yield). 2-Farnesyl-5-hydroxy-3-methoxy-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (4) (DMeQ3)—All steps were performed under argon in the absence of light. Granular lithium metal (278 mg, 40.0 mmol) was suspended in 8 ml of tetrahydrofuran, and the mixture was cooled to –70 °C. Trimethyltin chloride (1.0 ml, 8.0 mmol) was added dropwise, and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature over 30 min. The resulting (Me)3SnLi solution was transferred via syringe to a new vessel and cooled to –78 °C. Farnesyl chloride (2.3 ml, 8.8 mmol) was added to the solution, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h before warming to room temperature. The reaction was quenched with brine, extracted with Et2O, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo to give farnesyl trimethylstannane. Fumagatin (250 mg, 1.50 mmol) was dissolved in 30 ml of CH2Cl2 and cooled to –78 °C before adding BF3·OEt2 (0.56 ml, 4.5 mmol). Farnesyl trimethylstannane (604 mg, 1.60 mmol) was then dissolved in 1 ml of CH2Cl2 and added to the mixture. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h and then worked up as before. The crude DMQ3H2 was dissolved in 20 ml of Et2O before adding Ag2O (344 mg, 0.32 mmol). After 1 h, the reaction mixture was filtered and then worked up as before. Flash chromatography (6.5:3.5 Hex/EtOAc) was performed using silica gel to obtain DMeQ3 (53 mg, 21%). Methyltransferase Assays—Coq3 methyltransferase assays were performed as described (26Hsu A.Y. Do T.Q. Lee P.T. Clarke C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Each 250-μl reaction contained 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm ZnSO4,1mm NADH, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 mm 2-farnesyl-5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4 benzoquinone (27Poon W.W. Barkovich R.J. Hsu A.Y. Frankel A. Lee P.T. Shepherd J.N. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21665-21672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and 6.9 μCi of adenosyl-l-S-[methyl-3H]methionine (55–81.5 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Methyltransferase assays contained aliquots of intact mitochondria (80–200 μg), detergent-solubilized mitochondrial supernatants (80–200 μg), or gel filtration fractions (200 μl) and were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To stop the reaction, each tube was transferred to dry ice, and samples were extracted twice with 1 ml of heptane. Extracts were dried under N2 gas and stored at –20 °C. Reverse phase HPLC (Betabasic C18, 150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, Thermo Electron Corporation) was used to separate the 3H-labeled product, Q3. Initial conditions were: Solvent A (2 mm borate) 30% and Solvent B (95% ACN, 5% 2 mm borate) 70%. After injection the buffer composition and flow rate were linearly changed (time min/%B/flow rate (ml/min): 0/70/1, 2/70/1, 5/100/1.4). After 14 min the mobile phase and flow rate reverted to the initial state. HPLC fractions (1 min) were collected, added to 10 ml of Safety Solvent (Research Products International), and subjected to scintillation counting. Methyltransferase assays of gel filtration fractions were performed on the same day the gel filtration fractions were collected. Construction of Plasmids Containing Biotin-tagged Coq3—The gene for biotinylated Coq3p was constructed by an in-frame fusion of a PCR-amplified fragment containing the COQ3 open reading frame and 650 bp of 5′-flanking sequence to the vector YEp352-Bio6 (42Glerum D.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15585-15590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The amplification was carried out with pRS12A2-2.5Sma as template DNA (43Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a forward primer pBC3-1 (5′-TAAATTTCTGAGCTCGCCCCCGGGTATTTCATTTG-3′) and a reverse primer pBC3-2 (5′-CGCGGGATCCATTCAGTCTCTGAATAGCCA-3′). The PCR product was digested with SacI and BamHI and ligated to the SacI and BamHI sites of YEp352-Bio6 to generate pBT3-1. To construct a single copy vector containing the biotinylation site, pRS316 (44Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and SacI, treated with Klenow to generate blunt ends, and the vector re-ligated. This modified vector was then digested with HindIII and EcoRI and ligated with the 250-bp HindIII/EcoRI fragment obtained from YEp352-Bio6 to generate pSBT1. The COQ3 amplicon described above was then inserted into the SacI and BamHI sites of pSBT1 to generate pSBT3-1. The Coq3-biotinylated fusion protein (Coq3bt) retains activity as assayed by the ability of either the single copy or the multicopy plasmid construct to rescue the coq3 null yeast strain for growth on a nonfermentable carbon source (YPG). Avidin Capture—Mitochondria (500 μg) were lysed in 125 μl of digitonin buffer as above at a digitonin/protein ratio of 2:1. 10% of a high speed supernatant was reserved as a gel loading control, and the remaining supernatant was incubated 2 h at 4 °C with 100 μl of avidin-agarose (Pierce). Digitonin conditioning and wash buffer was 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 1.6 mm AEBSF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% digitonin. The agarose was collected by a brief centrifugation (500 × g, 30 s) the supernatant reserved, and the agarose beads were washed twice with wash buffer (1-ml volume, with and without 500 mm NaCl). The original supernatant and each wash were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%). The remaining agarose pellet was resuspended in an equivalent volume of 2× SDS sample buffer at 74 °C. After gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted as described in figure legends. NeutraAvidin-horseradish peroxidase antisera were obtained from Pierce and used as suggested. Reverse Phase HPLC-APCI-MS/MS Multiple Reaction Monitoring Analysis—An aliquot of each gel filtration fraction (150 μl) was placed into 5-ml borosilicate glass conical tubes with Teflon-lined caps and stored at –20 °C until extraction. Samples were thawed at 4 °C with gentle shaking, 968 pmol of internal standard was added (Q4, Sigma), followed by 1 ml of hexane/2-propanol (3:2, v/v) (45Radin N.S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). After shaking at 200 rpm for 10 min the samples were vortexed vigorously for 10 s and the phases allowed to separate (room temperature). The upper phase was transferred to a 2-ml amber glass vial. The lower phase was reextracted with heptane (1 ml) and the pooled organic phases concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and stored dry at –20 °C. Standard samples were prepared simultaneously with each batch of gel filtration samples. The standard samples"

https://openalex.org/W2033200165,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent inflammatory mediator, is involved in endothelial permeability. This study was designed to characterize PAF receptor (PAF-R) expression and its specific contribution to the modifications of adherens junctions in mouse endothelial cells. We demonstrated that PAF-R was expressed in mouse endothelial cells and was functionally active in stimulating p42/p44 MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3'-kinase)/Akt activities. Treatment of cells with PAF induced a rapid time- and dose-dependent (10(-7) to 10(-10) M) increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a subset of proteins ranging from 90 to 220 kDa, including the VE-cadherin, the latter effect being prevented by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbimycin A and bis-tyrphostin. We demonstrated that PAF promoted formation of multimeric aggregates of VE-cadherin with PtdIns3'-kinase, which was also inhibited by herbimycin and bis-tyrphostin. Finally, we show by immunostaining of endothelial cells VE-cadherin that PAF dissociated adherens junctions. The present data provide the first evidence that treatment of endothelial cells with PAF promoted activation of tyrosine kinases and the VE-cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation and PtdIns3'-kinase association, which ultimately lead to the dissociation of adherens junctions. Physical association between PtdIns3'-kinase, serving as a docking protein, and VE-cadherin may thus provide an efficient mechanism for amplification and perpetuation of PAF-induced cellular activation."
https://openalex.org/W2051297868,"In the present study, we employed a well established JB6 mouse epithelial cell model to define the molecular mechanism of efficacy of a naturally occurring flavonoid silibinin against ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced skin tumorigenesis. UVB exposure of cells caused a moderate phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt and a stronger phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15, which was enhanced markedly by silibinin pretreatment. Kinase activity of ERK1/2 for Elk-1 and Akt for glycogen synthase kinase-3β was also potently enhanced by silibinin pretreatment. Furthermore, silibinin increased the UVB-induced level of cleaved caspase 3 as well as apoptotic cells. Based on these observations, next we investigated the role of upstream kinases, ATM/ATR and DNA-PK, which act as sensors for UVB-induced DNA damage and transduce signals leading to DNA repair or apoptosis. Whereas UVB strongly activated ATM as observed by Ser1981 phosphorylation, it was not affected by silibinin pretreatment. However, pretreatment of cells with the DNA-protein kinase (PK) inhibitor LY294002 strongly reversed silibinin-enhanced Akt-Ser473 and p53-Ser15 as well as ERK1/2 phosphorylation together with a dose-dependent decrease in cleaved caspase 3 and apoptosis (p < 0.05). In addition, silibinin pretreatment strongly enhanced H2A.X-Ser139 phosphorylation and DNA-PK-associated kinase activity as well as the physical interaction of p53 with DNA-PK; pretreatment of cells with LY294002 but not caffeine abolished the silibinin-caused increase in both DNA-PK activation and p53-Ser15 phosphorylations. Together, these findings suggest that silibinin preferentially activates the DNA-PK-p53 pathway for apoptosis in response to UVB-induced DNA damage, and that this could be a predominant mechanism of silibinin efficacy against UVB-induced skin cancer.

Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In recent years, chemoprevention is considered to be a promising strategy for the control of this malignancy, where several studies have shown that various phytochemicals from both nutritive and non-nutritive sources protect against UVB-induced skin cancer (2Katiyar S.K.

In this regard, silymarin (a polyphenolic flavonoid antioxidant from milk thistle) and silibinin (the bioactive component in silymarin) have also shown strong potential in preventing UV-induced skin damages and photocarcinogenesis (2Katiyar S.K.

We also found that silymarin protects against chemical carcinogenesis in SENCAR mouse skin by modulating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and inducing apoptosis (3Singh R.P. Tyagi A.K.

In a more recent study, we observed a strong protective effect of silibinin against UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis in SKH-1 mice where topical applications before or after UVB or its dietary feeding were effective in inhibiting tumor multiplicity as well as tumor volume (7Mallikarjuna G. Dhanalakshmi S. Singh R.P. Agarwal C. Agarwal R. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6349-6356Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Also, we have reported the dual effects of silibinin in protecting from or enhancing apoptosis in response to UVB-induced moderate/excessive damage in spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte HaCaT cells (5Dhanalakshmi S. Mallikarjuna G.U. Singh R.P. Agarwal R. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Exposure of skin to UVB results in genotoxic stress which is a major cause for skin cancer initiation (1Bachelor M.A. Bowden G.T. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In recent years, important roles of ataxia telangiectasia mutated and ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related (ATM/ATR) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) were identified in DNA damage recognition and subsequent initiation of downstream protein kinase cascades (8Yang J. Yu Y. Hamrick H.E. Duerksen-Hughes P.J. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Both ATM and ATR are activated by DNA damage although ATR has been shown to be specifically associated with damage induced by UV (9Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). DNA-PK has recently been identified as a crucial molecule activating apoptotic machinery in response to DNA damage, particularly DNA double strand breaks (10Burma S. Chen D.J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DNA-PK is a nuclear serine-threonine kinase composed of a catalytic subunit and a Ku70/80 subunit, which is activated during DNA damage induced by both ionizing and UV radiations (10Burma S. Chen D.J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and is regarded as a DNA damage sensor (10Burma S. Chen D.J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DNA-PK complexed with p53 has been shown to act as a sensor of abnormal DNA structures (11Achanta G. Pelicano H. Feng L. Plunkett W. Huang P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8723-8729PubMed Google Scholar), and p53 has been shown as an effector for DNA-PK-mediated signaling where DNA-PK selectively regulates a p53-dependent apoptotic response (12Wang S. Guo M. Ouyang H. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. Fuks Z. Ling C.C. Li G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1584-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that these damage sensor molecules such as ATM/ATR and DNA-PK play a pivotal role in protecting from UV-caused tumor initiation and promotion (9Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar, 10Burma S. Chen D.J. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).In addition to its direct DNA damaging effects causing tumor initiation, UVB also acts as a tumor promoter in the development of non-melanoma skin cancer (13Brash D.E. Ziegler A. Jonason A.S. Simon J.A. Kunala S. Leffell D.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1996; 1: 136-142PubMed Google Scholar, 14Whittaker S. Br. J. Hosp. Med. 1996; 56: 515-518PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports show that UVB-induced diverse mitogenic and survival signaling pathways are responsible for its tumor promoting effects (15Heck D.E. Gerecke D.R. Vetrano A.M. Laskin J.D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2004; 195: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Sodhi A. Sethi G. Immunol. Lett. 2003; 90: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) where these signals converge into activating transcription factors such as AP1 and nuclear factor-κB that are crucial in tumor promotion (17Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar, 18Huang C. Huang Y. Li J. Hu W. Aziz R. Tang M.S. Sun N. Cassady J. Stoner G.D.

For instance, it has been shown that activation of MAPK ERK1/2 is indispensable for UVB-induced cell transformation and promotion of JB6 cells (20Huang C. Ma W.Y. Young M.R. Colburn N. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) where UVB-caused p53-Ser15 phosphorylation is ERK1/2-dependent (21She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 22Kaji A. Zhang Y. Nomura M. Bode A.M. Ma W.Y. She Q.B. Dong Z. Mol. Carcinog. 2003; 37: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ERK1/2 also induces apoptosis in response to various stress signals, in both p53-dependent and -independent manners (23She Q.B. Bode A.M. Ma W.Y. Chen N.Y. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1604-1610PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rul W. Zugasti O. Roux P. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Franke T.F. Lenormand P. Fort P. Hibner U. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) is another kinase that is activated in response to many growth factors and mitogens, including UVB, and controls cellular signaling molecules responsible for preventing cell death (26Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 27Fresno Vara J.A. Casado E. de Castro J. Cejas P. Belda-Iniesta C. Gonzalez-Baron M. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2004; 30: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar).Induction of apoptosis is one of the key mechanisms by which various chemopreventive agents provide protection from DNA damage-induced tumor initiation and subsequent clonal expansion of the initiated cells during tumor promotion (28Sinha R. El-Bayoumy K. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 29Holmes W.F. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 199: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). p53 is critical in the UVB-mediated DNA damage response, and depending on the magnitude of DNA damage, p53 aids in either DNA repair or in inducing apoptosis (30Huang L.C. Clarkin K.C. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4827-4832Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p53 in response to UVB radiation leads to its stabilization and activation (21She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), which is crucial in p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis (31Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 32Chao C. Saito S. Kang J. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4967-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that agents, which could modulate UVB-induced signaling pathways, especially damage sensors such as ATM/ATR and DNA-PK or an effector molecule such as p53 could be both novel and useful in protecting against photocarcinogenesis. In the present study, we assessed the effect of silibinin on UVB-induced apoptosis and associated molecular mechanisms employing well studied JB6 mouse keratinocytes as a model.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and UVB Irradiation—JB6 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 25 μg/ml gentamicin, and 5% serum under standard culture conditions. For all treatments, cells were grown to 80% confluence and then either treated with silibinin (100 μm) for 24 h or treated for 2 h with the indicated inhibitors before silibinin treatment. Before UVB irradiation, media was removed from culture plates; cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice and then covered with a thin layer of phosphate-buffered saline followed by UVB irradiation. Control cultures were identically processed but not irradiated. The UVB light source was a bank of four FS24T12-UVB-HO sunlamps equipped with a UVB Spectra 305 Dosimeter (Daavlin Co., Bryan, OH), which emitted about 80% radiation in the range of 280–340 nm with a peak emission at 314 nm as monitored with a SEL 240 photodetector, 103 filter and 1008 diffuser attached to an IL 1400 Research Radiometer (International Light, Newburyport, MA).Reagents and Antibodies—Silibinin was purchased from Sigma, and its purity was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography as 100% pure (33Zhao J. Agarwal R. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 2101-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies against phosphorylated and total ERK1/2, p38, JNK1/2, and Akt, cleaved caspase 3, phospho-p53-Ser15 as well as other phospho-p53 for different serine sites were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Anti-ATM (ps1981) was from Rockland Immunochemicals (Gilbertsville, PA). Anti-γH2A.X (Ser139) was from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-DNA-PK, MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, and DNA-PK inhibitor LY294002 were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). DNA-cellulose was obtained from Sigma. DNA-PK substrate peptide (Glu-Pro-Pro-Leu-Ser-Gln-Glu-Ala-Phe-Ala-Asp-Leu-Trp-Lys-Lys) was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Biosciences.Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared in non-denaturing lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 units/ml aprotinin), and protein concentration in lysates was determined using Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). For immunoblot analyses, 40–100 μg of protein per sample was denatured in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on Tris/glycine gels. The separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes followed by blocking with 5% nonfat milk powder (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then probed with specific primary antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and visualized by ECL detection system. Data presented for Western blots are representative of at least two to three independent experiments in each case.Kinase Activity Assay for ERK1/2 and Akt/PKB—Kinase activity assays for ERK1/2 and Akt were done according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA) with some modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm PMSF) after the desired treatments and cell extracts were prepared. Two hundred μg of protein from each sample was immunoprecipitated using immobilized phospho-specific ERK p44/p42 or Akt antibody at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes obtained were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The bead pellets were re-suspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of substrate (Elk-1 for ERK and GSK-3α/β for Akt) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated with 5× SDS sample buffer, and samples were boiled for 5 min, centrifuged, and supernatants were loaded on 12% Tris/glycine gel. Substrate phosphorylation was visualized by immunoblotting using phospho-specific antibody for Elk-1 and GSK-3α/β.Propidium Iodide Staining and Flow Cytometry Analysis—For analysis of cell cycle distribution, JB6 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes, and the next day treated with silibinin (100 μm) for 24 h. Cells were then either unexposed or sham-irradiated to 100 mJ/cm2 UVB. Cells were collected at 24 h after UVB exposure, stained with saponin/propidium iodide (PI), and analyzed by flow cytometry in the FACS Analysis Core Facility at the University of Colorado Cancer Center, Denver, CO.Annexin/PI Staining and Flow Cytometry Analysis—For apoptosis analysis, JB6 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes, and the next day treated with silibinin (100 μm) alone, the desired inhibitors alone, or pre-treated with inhibitors for 2 h before silibinin treatment. After 24 h, cells were either unexposed or exposed to 100 mJ/cm2 UVB. Cells were collected at the indicated times after UVB exposure, stained with annexin V/PI (Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's protocol, and apoptotic cell population was then analyzed immediately by flow cytometry in the FACS Analysis Core Facility, University of Colorado Cancer Center, as published earlier (6Mohan S. Dhanalakshmi S. Mallikarjuna G.U. Singh R.P. Agarwal R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Morphological Analysis—Following the desired treatments, pictures for cellular morphology were taken using a Kodak DC290 camera under an inverted microscope at ×100 magnification and processed using the Kodak Microscopy Documentation System 290 (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY).DNA-PK Pull-down and Kinase Assay—JB6 cells after the desired treatments were harvested by trypsinization, pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 mm PMSF and again with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm PMSF. The cell pellets were then re-suspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 mm DTT and 0.2 mm PMSF) and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Finally, cells were re-suspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer, incubated on ice for 10 min, and flash frozen and stored at –80 °C until further use. The cell extracts were quickly thawed at 37 °C and 50 μl of the each extract was removed and added with 5.5 μl each of 5 m NaCl, 100 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT. To dilute the salt, the extracts were then added with 4 volumes of 50 mm HEPES, 0.5 m KCl (pH 7.5). The diluted extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 3 min and supernatants were collected and used for the assay. Briefly, to the diluted supernatant, a 40-μl slurry of 5 mg of DNA-cellulose/sample (pre-equilibrated overnight with wash buffer, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF) was added and incubated with gentle rotation at 4 °C for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged and re-extracted with 20 μl of DNA-cellulose. The pellets were then re-suspended in 30 μl of wash buffer. For the kinase assay, 14 μl of the DNA-cellulose bound sample was added with 2 μl of 0.1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm DTT, 2 μl of substrate peptide, 2 μl of 1 mm ATP containing [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 30% acetic acid containing 2.5 mm cold ATP. 15 μl of each sample was spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper, washed 4 times with 15% acetic acid, and counted using a liquid scintillation counter.DNA-PK-p53 Binding Assay—For the DNA-PK-p53 binding assay, we used DNA-cellulose-extracted samples from the DNA-PK pull-down assay. These samples were added with 2× sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was then loaded on a 4 (for DNA-PK) or 12% (for p53) Tris/glycine gel and Western blotting was carried out as mentioned above. Membranes were probed with DNA-PK or p53 primary antibody followed by secondary antibodies and ECL detection as mentioned above.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat 2.03 software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) as needed. Data were analyzed using t test as needed and a statistically significant difference was considered to be at p < 0.05.RESULTSSilibinin Enhances UVB-caused Phosphorylation and Kinase Activity of ERK1/2 and Akt/PKB—First, we assessed the effect of silibinin pre- or post-treatment on UVB-induced MAPK family molecules ERK1/2, p38, and JNK, and Akt/PKB, as these molecules are crucial transducers of UVB-induced signaling cascades. JB6 cells without any serum starvation were treated with Me2SO alone or different doses of silibinin (25, 50, and 100 μm) in Me2SO for 24 h and then irradiated with 100 mJ/cm2 UVB dose. In some cultures, silibinin was added at similar doses immediately after UVB exposure. In all cases, cells were collected 24 h after UVB exposure and cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for the desired signaling molecules. Exposure of cells to UVB caused a weak phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 1A), p38 (Fig. 1B), JNK1/2 (Fig. 1C), and Akt-Ser473 (Fig. 1D), which were either not detectable or were at low levels in mock-irradiated controls. Interestingly, UVB-caused phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 1A) and Akt (Fig. 1D) was strongly enhanced by silibinin pre-treatment at 100 μm dose without any change in their total protein levels. Pretreatment of cells with lower doses of silibinin or post-treatment at all doses did not show any changes compared with UVB alone (data not shown). In addition, there was no observable change in the phospho- or total levels of p38 and JNK with silibinin treatments (Fig. 1, B and C).Because we found a further increase in UVB-induced ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation by silibinin pre-treatment, we next assessed whether this is accompanied by an increase in their kinase activity as well as phosphorylation of their downstream substrates Elk-1 and GSK-3α/β, respectively. Phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-Akt were immunoprecipitated from total lysates employing their specific primary antibodies and then in vitro kinase assays were performed using Elk-1 and GSK-3 as substrates, respectively. Kinase activities of ERK1/2 and Akt as observed by the phosphorylation of Elk-1 (Fig. 1E) and GSK-3α/β (Fig. 1F), respectively, were also enhanced strongly by silibinin pre-treatment as compared with UVB alone. Similarly, silibinin pre-treatment also caused a strong increase in the phosphorylation of Elk-1 (Fig. 1G) and GSK-3α/β (Fig. 1H); actin immunoblotting confirmed equal protein loading (Fig. 1I). All together, these results were comparable with an increase in ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation observed by Western blotting, and support the notion that silibinin pre-treatment upregulates kinase activities of ERK1/2 and Akt when cells are exposed to UVB.Silibinin Enhances UVB-mediated p53-Serine 15 Phosphorylation—p53 is known to play a crucial role in UVB-induced cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, and serine 15 phosphorylation is essential for stabilization and activation of p53 (21She Q.B. Chen N. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20444-20449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Accordingly, next we assessed the effect of silibinin pre-treatment on UVB-induced p53 phosphorylation and its total levels by Western immunoblotting. Under identical treatment protocols as for ERK1/2 and Akt analyses (Fig. 1A–I), compared with sham irradiated and silibinin (100 μm) alone treated controls, UVB exposure at 100 mJ/cm2 dose resulted in a strong p53-Ser15 phosphorylation and accumulation (Fig. 1J); however, pre-treatment of cells with silibinin for 24 h before UVB exposure resulted in a much stronger increase in both p53-Ser15 phosphorylation and stabilization (Fig. 1J). The effect of silibinin pre-treatment on UVB-induced p53 phosphorylation was specific to Ser15, as we did not observe any considerable change in Ser6, and Ser392 phosphorylation sites of p53 (Fig. 1, K and L). Additionally, phospho-p53-Ser9 and phospho-p53-Ser20 were not detectable in our experimental conditions following UVB, silibinin plus UVB, and silibinin alone treatments (data not shown).Differential Kinetics of Silibinin plus UVB-Versus UVB-caused ERK1/2, Akt, and p53 Phosphorylation and p53 Stabilization—Based on our findings that silibinin pre-treatment for 24 h followed by UVB irradiation at 100 mJ/cm2 dose and analyzing samples 24 h thereafter causes strong ERK1/2, Akt, and p53 phosphorylation and p53 stabilization, two different studies were next performed seeking a UVB dose-response and a time kinetics of the observed effects following UVB irradiations. Under the identical experimental conditions mentioned above, an increase in UVB dose from 100 to 200 and 400 mJ/cm2 did result in an alteration in ERK1/2 (Fig. 2A) and Akt (Fig. 2B) phosphorylation, but interestingly decreased both UVB alone and silibinin plus UVB-caused p53-Ser15 phosphorylation and stabilization (Fig. 2C). Based on our observations that a UVB dose higher than 100 mJ/cm2 does not result in an additional increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, or p53, all further studies were done employing 100 mJ/cm2 UVB as the dose.Fig. 2Sustained enhancing effect of silibinin on UVB-induced ERK1/2 and Akt activation, and p53-Ser15 phosphorylation. JB6 cells were treated with Me2SO or 100 μm silibinin for 24 h and then either mock-irradiated or irradiated with (A–C) the indicated doses of UVB and harvested 24 h later, and cell lysates were prepared for the analysis of p-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 (A), p-Akt and total Akt (B), and p-p53-Ser15 and total p53 (C) by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” JB6 cells with or without silibinin pretreatment were exposed to a 100 mJ/cm2 UVB dose and harvested at different times after UVB exposure (D–G) and analyzed for phosphorylated and total levels of ERK1/2 (D), Akt (E), and p53 (F and G) by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the time kinetic studies at 3, 6, and 12 h, compared with UVB alone, silibinin pre-treatment started showing a very strong increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation beginning 3 h after UVB irradiation and remained sustained at 6 and 12 h (Fig. 2D). Additional studies at 24, 48, and 72 h showed similar sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation in silibinin plus UVB-exposed cells compared with a marginal response in UVB alone samples (data not shown). In the case of Akt phosphorylation, compared with UVB alone, silibinin pre-treatment started showing a further increase at 6 h after"
https://openalex.org/W2111622139,"Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is a critical signaling factor for a variety of developmental pathways during embryogenesis, including the specification of left-right asymmetry in the heart. Mice that lack Hedgehog signaling show a delay in the induction of cardiomyogenesis, as indicated by a delayed expression of Nkx2-5. To further examine a role for Shh in cardiomyogenesis, clonal populations of P19 cells that stably express Shh, termed P19(Shh) cells, were isolated. In monolayer P19(Shh) cultures the Shh pathway was functional as shown by the up-regulation of Ptc1 and Gli1 expression, but no cardiac muscle markers were activated. However, Shh expression induced cardiomyogenesis following cellular aggregation, resulting in the expression of factors expressed in cardiac muscle including GATA-4, MEF2C, and Nkx2-5. Furthermore, aggregated P19 cell lines expressing Gli2 or Meox1 also up-regulated the expression of cardiac muscle factors, leading to cardiomyogenesis. Meox1 up-regulated the expression of Gli1 and Gli2 and, thus, can modify the Shh signaling pathway. Finally, Shh, Gli2, and Meox1 all up-regulated BMP-4 expression, implying that activation of the Hedgehog pathway can regulate bone morphogenetic protein signals. Taken together, we propose a model in which Shh, functioning via Gli1/2, can specify mesodermal cells into the cardiac muscle lineage.

GATA-4 is one of the earliest expressed cardiac transcription factors in the developing murine heart (8Heikinheimo M. Scandrett J.M. Wilson D.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). GATA-4 can physically interact and function synergistically with Nkx2-5 and MEF2 (9Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J.

GATA-4, MEF2C, or Nkx2-5 can activate each other's expression (11Dodou E. Verzi M.P. Anderson J.P. Xu S.M. Black B.L.

Finally, mice lacking any one of these transcription factors display severe defects in heart formation (5Lyons I. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Li R. Andrews J.E. Robb L. Harvey R.P.

Thus, the expression of GATA-4, MEF2C, and Nkx2-5 is indicative of a cardiac muscle phenotype. Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted glycoprotein that is involved in a plethora of developmental processes (20Goodrich L.V. Scott M.P. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1243-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 21Ming J.E. Roessler E. Muenke M. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 343-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is a key signal in determining left-right asymmetry that includes situating the heart on the left side of the body (22Levin M. Johnson R.L. Stern C.D. Kuehn M. Tabin C. Cell. 1995; 82: 803-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 23Tsukui T. Capdevila J. Tamura K. Ruiz-Lozano P. Rodriguez-Esteban C. Yonei-Tamura S. Magallon J. Chandraratna R.A.

Biol. 1999; 210: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The Shh signaling pathway is mediated by Gli1/2/3, a family of zinc-finger transcription factors that are regulated at the protein and expression level by Shh (25Platt K.A. Michaud J. Joyner A.L. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Kim J. Kim P. Hui C.C. Clin. Genet. 2001; 59: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 27Ruppert J.M.

The transmission of Shh signaling is accomplished via its receptor Patched1 (Ptc1) and Smoothened (Smo). The current model proposes that Shh binds to Ptc1 and, upon complex formation, both proteins are brought into the cell by endocytosis and degraded by the lysosomal pathway. This allows the trafficking of Smo, situated in the Golgi apparatus, to the plasma membrane. Smo then mediates the activation of intracellular factors resulting in the positive regulation of the Gli2/3 protein. In turn, these factors regulate the expression of Shh target genes such as Ptc1 and Gli1 (28Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests a role for the Shh signaling pathway in heart morphogenesis. Shh–/– and Gli2–/–Gli3–/+ mice both display a heart-looping defect (23Tsukui T. Capdevila J. Tamura K. Ruiz-Lozano P. Rodriguez-Esteban C. Yonei-Tamura S. Magallon J. Chandraratna R.A. Chien K. Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Belmonte J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1998; 20: 54-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), and Ptc1–/– mice exhibit heart morphological defects (30Goodrich L.V. Milenkovic L. Higgins K.M. Scott M.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several studies also support an involvement for Shh and Gli factors in regulating cardiomyogenesis. Mice lacking the Smo gene (31Zhang X.M. Ramalho-Santos M. McMahon A.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 781-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) were embryonic lethal, likely due to defects in cardiac looping. Upon examination of the cardiac crescent in these mice, Nkx2-5 expression was found to be severely down-regulated. Upon fusion of the pre-cardiac fields, Nkx2-5 expression returned to wild-type levels. Finally, in the same study homozygous Ptc1 mutant mice displayed a widened expression domain of Nkx2-5 in the cardiac crescent in comparison to wild-type mice. Therefore, Shh signaling via Ptc1 and Smo seems to be critical for maintaining wild-type levels of Nkx2-5 expression in the cardiac crescent. Shh and Gli factors are expressed throughout the mesoderm during gastrulation (22Levin M. Johnson R.L. Stern C.D. Kuehn M. Tabin C. Cell. 1995; 82: 803-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 32Hui C.C. Slusarski D. Platt K.A. Holmgren R. Joyner A.L. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 402-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Particularly, Shh is expressed in Henson's node and other early mid-line structures (31Zhang X.M. Ramalho-Santos M. McMahon A.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 781-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). This indicates that Shh and Gli factors are present at the correct time in embryonic heart development to be involved in specifying early mesodermal cells to progress into the cardiac lineage. Meox1/2 are homeobox-containing transcription factors (33Candia A.F. Hu J. Crosby J. Lalley P.A. Noden D. Nadeau J.H. Wright C.V. Development. 1992; 116: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that have been investigated for their roles in skeletal myogenesis and sclerotome formation (34Mankoo B.S. Collins N.S. Ashby P.

Biol. 2004; 24: 2757-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as they are expressed in the developing somite (33Candia A.F. Hu J. Crosby J. Lalley P.A. Noden D. Nadeau J.H. Wright C.V. Development. 1992; 116: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Candia A.F. Wright C.V. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 40: 1179-1184PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Meox1/2 have a distinctive expression pattern in several stages of heart development in the mouse. Meox1/2 proteins are expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm at E7.5–E8 (38Skopicki H.A. Lyons G.E. Schatteman G. Smith R.C. Andres V. Schirm S. Isner J. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 452-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), with Meox1 mRNA detected just prior to the protein expression (33Candia A.F. Hu J. Crosby J. Lalley P.A. Noden D. Nadeau J.H. Wright C.V. Development. 1992; 116: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In later heart stages Meox1 mRNA is found in the outflow tract of the premature heart at E10.5 (33Candia A.F. Hu J. Crosby J. Lalley P.A. Noden D. Nadeau J.H. Wright C.V. Development. 1992; 116: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the Meox2 protein is expressed in the linear heart tube at E8.0 and E12.5 in the atrial/ventricular myocytes (38Skopicki H.A. Lyons G.E. Schatteman G. Smith R.C. Andres V. Schirm S. Isner J. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 452-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Meox1 protein is also found in the primitive streak where pre-cardiac cells are first thought to be specified to the heart lineage (37Candia A.F. Wright C.V. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 40: 1179-1184PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, there is a MEF2 binding site in the Meox2 promoter, and MEF2C and Meox2 have very similar spatio-temporal expression patterns in the developing heart. Interestingly, mice lacking both Meox1/2 genes showed no gross abnormality of the heart at p.c. 16.5 (35Mankoo B.S. Skuntz S. Harrigan I. Grigorieva E. Candia A. Wright C.V. Arnheiter H. Pachnis V. Development. 2003; 130: 4655-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recent results in our laboratory utilizing the P19 cell system have shown that Meox1 and Gli2 are involved in a positive regulatory loop (39Petropoulos H. Gianakopoulos P.J. Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23874-23881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in differentiating P19 cells. P19 cells comprise a pluripotent embryonal carcinoma stem cell line that can differentiate into cardiomyocytes in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and with cellular aggregation (40Skerjanc I.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of Shh, Gli2, and Meox1 in the context of embryonic stem cells, we expressed each of these factors in P19 cells and examined the differentiation potential of each cell line. Aggregated P19 cells expressing either Shh, Gli2, or Meox1 were capable of differentiating into cardiac muscle in the absence of Me2SO. Therefore, these factors appear to play a role in the specification of mesodermal cells into the cardiac muscle lineage. Plasmid Constructs—Meox1 cDNA was sub-cloned into the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) vector as described previously (39Petropoulos H. Gianakopoulos P.J. Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23874-23881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The coding domain of Shh was amplified by PCR utilizing the oligonucleotides 5′-AAACTCGAGCCACCATGCTGCTGCTGCTGGCC-3′ and 3′-AAACTCGAGTCAGCTGGACTTGACCGC-5′ at an annealing temperature of 67.7 °C. The 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides contained XhoI sites (boldface) to facilitate cloning. Amplified cDNA was then sub-cloned into pCR-Blunt Vector (Invitrogen). Shh cDNA was subsequently sub-cloned into the PGK vector containing the pgk-1 promoter (41Adra C.N. Boer P.H. McBurney M.W. Gene. 1987; 60: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The PGK-Puro and PGK-LacZ constructs were described previously (42Rogerson P.J. Jamali M. Skerjanc I.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—P19 cells were cultured as described (43Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1999; 35: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in α-minimum essential media supplemented with 5% Cosmic calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 5% fetal bovine serum (CanSera, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada). Stable cell lines were isolated as described previously (15Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19033-19039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PGK-Meox1 stable cell lines were prepared as described previously (39Petropoulos H.

Briefly, CMV-Gli2 and PGK-Shh were stably transfected using the FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent per the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). A mixture containing 2.04 μg of CMV-Gli2, PGK-Shh, or PGK vector alone for controls, and 0.09 μg of PGK-puro, 0.17 μg of PGK-LacZ, and 0.77 μg of B17 were used to create the Gli2 and Shh cell lines. For all stable transfections, a mixture of DNA and the FuGENE™ 6 reagent was added to 2.5 × 105 cells in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. Transfection efficiency for each experiment was assessed by β-galactosidase assays as described (48Norton P.A. Coffin J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 281-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were selected for puromycin resistance (2 μg/ml) for 7–9 days. Resulting colonies were tested for expression by slot blot analysis, and stable cells lines were isolated and termed P19(Gli2), P19(Shh), or P19(control) cells. P19(control), P19(Gli2), P19(Shh) and P19(Meox1) cells were differentiated in the absence of Me2SO, and P19 cells were differentiated in the presence of 0.8% Me2SO as described (15Skerjanc I.S.

Differentiation involved aggregation of cells for 4 days in Petri dishes (in the absence or presence of Me2SO) followed by plating into tissue culture dishes on day 4. Cells were harvested for total RNA on day 6. Immunofluorescence—For assaying myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and cardiac α-actin expression, cells were plated onto gelatin-coated coverslips on day 4 and fixed on day 6 in –20 °C methanol. Cells were rehydrated in PBS, MyHC expression was detected utilizing the monoclonal MF20 antibody supernatant (50Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), and cardiac α-actin expression was detected utilizing the Ac1–20.4.2 antibody (Research Diagnostics Inc.). Nuclei were detected by Hoechst stain as described previously (47Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19033-19039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In brief, 100 μl of a 1:1 dilution of the MF20 supernatant or 100 μl of a 1:10 dilution of Ac1-20.4.2 in 2% albumin and 2% sheep serum PBS was incubated on coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed three times for 5 min each time in PBS and incubated with 100 μl of a 1:100 dilution of goat anti-mouse Cy3-linked antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. After the PBS washes, coverslips were mounted, and immunofluorescence for MyHC was visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Images were captured on a Sony 3 charge-coupled device camera and processed utilizing Axiovision, Adobe Photoshop7, and Canvas8 software. Immunofluorescence for cardiac α-actin was visualized with an Olympus BX50 microscope. Images were captured on a Roger Scientific Cool Snap camera and processed utilizing Image Pro-Plus 5.1 (Media Cybernetics) and Canvas 9 software. For assaying GATA-4 expression, cells were plated as above and fixed on day 6 with 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were then perforated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 2% horse serum and 2% albumin PBS. Expression was detected utilizing a goat anti-GATA-4 antibody (sc-1237; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Briefly, 100 μl of a 1:100 dilution of anti-GATA-4 antibody in blocking solution was incubated on coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed as described above and incubated with 100 μl of a 1:800 dilution of donkey anti-goat Cy3-linked antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at room temperature for 1 h. After PBS washes, immunofluorescence was visualized, and images were processed on cardiac α-actin-stained coverslips as described above. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from each differentiation utilizing the LiCl method, as described (44Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 12 μg of total RNA were separated on a 1% agarose and formaldehyde gel, transferred onto Hybond-N (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary action, and cross-linked by UV light irradiation. Blots were then hybridized to DNA probes labeled with (α-32P)dNTP by multi-prime labeling (Amersham Biosciences) for 16 h at 42 °C. Probes for BMP-4, Nkx2-5, GATA-4, MEF2C, Meox1, Gli2, and 18S (for standardization of loading) have been described previously (47Ridgeway A.G. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19033-19039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The probes used were a 908-bp BamHI fragment of mouse Shh cDNA, an 841-bp EcoRI fragment of mouse Ptc1 cDNA, a 1.6-kb EcoRI fragment of Gli1 cDNA, an 0.8-kb EcoRI fragment of Gli3 cDNA, a 2.1-kb EcoRI fragment of a mouse Zic1 expressed sequence tag clone (EST) (clone identifier 6418777; Invitrogen), and a 992-bp SstI fragment of a mouse Zic3 EST clone (clone identifier 5120056; Invitrogen). The Ptc1 probe utilized for Southern blot analysis of RT-PCR products consisted of full-length mouse Ptc1 cDNA. Northern blots were then washed five times for 5 min each in low stringency wash (2× SSC, 0.2% SDS) at 42 °C and for 15 min in high stringency wash (0.1× SSC, 0.2% SDS) at 65 °C. Blots were visualized by autoradiography. Quantitative analyses were performed using National Institutes of Health Image 1.63 software. Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was harvested on day 6 utilizing the LiCl method, followed by purification with the RNeasy® mini kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Approximately 1 μg of DNase I-treated RNA was used to synthesize first strand DNA, utilizing the Superscript first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Random hexamers (50 ng) were utilized per the manufacturer's protocol. Two microliters of first strand DNA was then used for PCR reactions. The oligonucleotides and PCR conditions for Nkx2-5 and tubulin have been described previously (15Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34904-34910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for amplifying Ptc1 were 5′-AACAAAAATTCAACCAAACCTC-3′ and 3′-TGTCTTCATTCCAGTTGATGTG-5′ at an annealing temperature of 55 °C. Oligonucleotides for amplifying β-actin were 5′-TCGTCGACAACGGCTCCGGC-3′ and 3′-CCAGCCAGGTCCAGACGCAG-5′ at an annealing temperature of 56 °C. Oligonucleotides for amplifying Shh were 5′-TCTGTGATGAACCAGTGGCC-3′ and 3′-GCCACGGAGTTCTCTGCTTT-5′ at an annealing temperature of 58 °C. Oligonucleotides for amplifying MEF2C were 5′-TAATGGATGAGCGTAACAGACAGG-3′ and 3′-ATCAGACCGCCTGTGTTACC-5′ at an annealing temperature of 61 °C. First strand reactions were tested for linearity with each set of oligonucleotides, and negative controls included RT experiments in the absence of RNA or reverse transcriptase enzyme and PCR in the absence of a first strand reaction. Southern blot analysis was carried out to analyze RT-PCR products by utilizing probes for tubulin, Nkx2-5 as described previously (15Skerjanc I.S. Petropoulos H. Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34904-34910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and Shh as described for Northern blot analysis. The probe for β-actin consisted of an ∼520-bp fragment of the PCR product amplified with the primers described above. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—P19(Shh), P19(control), and P19 cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm tissue culture dishes. The media were then retrieved, and the concentration of Shh was measured therein using the R&D Systems DuoSet ELISA development kit (DY461) and the SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate reader and software (Molecular Devices). Shh Induces Cardiomyogenesis in Aggregated P19 Cells— Because previous studies have implicated a role for Shh signaling in heart morphogenesis, we tested whether Shh signaling was sufficient to induce cardiomyogenesis in P19 cells. As such, we isolated clonal populations of P19 cells overexpressing Shh termed P19(Shh) cells. Subsequently, we aggregated P19(Shh) cells and P19(control) cells in the absence of Me2SO. On day 6 of the differentiation, cultures were examined for the presence of cardiomyocytes. Staining with an anti-MyHC antibody showed the formation of cardiomyocytes in P19(Shh) cells but not in P19(control) cells (Fig. 1, compare panel D with panel B). Although MyHC is expressed in both cardiac and skeletal myocytes, the morphology indicated a rounded cardiomyocyte phenotype as opposed to a bipolar skeletal myocyte phenotype. Hoechst dye staining was included as a control for cell number in both stains (Fig. 1, A and C). Eleven stable P19 cell lines overexpressing Shh with the capacity to induce cardiomyogenesis over controls were isolated. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we determined the concentration of extracellular Shh in the media of confluent cultures of the three P19(Shh) clones that were used for further analysis, as well as the P19(control) and parental P19 cells. The concentration of Shh found in the extracellular media of P19(Shh) cells was found to be between ∼8 and 19 μg/ml (data not shown), whereas the concentration of Shh in the extracellular media of P19(control) and P19 cells was found to be lower than the detectable limit of the assay, which was 7.5 pg/ml. To further analyze the cardiac muscle phenotype, the induction of gene expression was monitored by Northern blot or RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2, panels I and II, respectively), and the induction of protein expression was monitored via immunofluorescence (Fig. 3). Northern blot analysis showed that Shh transcripts were overexpressed in P19(Shh) cells, whereas P19(control) cells, both positive and negative, showed no detectable Shh expression at this exposure level (Fig. 2, panel I, section A). GATA-4, BMP-4, MEF2C, and Nkx2-5 gene expressions were found to be up-regulated in P19(Shh) cells on day 6 but not in P19(control) cells (Fig. 2, panel I, sections B and C and panel II, sections L and M, respectively), confirming the presence of cardiomyocytes.Fig. 3GATA-4 and cardiac α-actin proteins accumulate in the nucleus of Shh-expressing P19 cells. P19 control cells (A, B, E, and F) and P19(Shh) cells (C, D, G, and H) were differentiated in the absence of Me2SO. On day 6 of differentiation, cells were fixed and reacted with Hoechst dye to detect nuclei (A, C, E, and G), anti-GATA-4 antibody (B and D) or anti-cardiac α-actin antibody (E and H). Magnification is 400×.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the up-regulation of GATA-4 transcript levels corresponded to an increase in protein expression, we examined the expression of the GATA-4 protein in differentiated P19(Shh) cells by immunofluorescence with an anti-GATA-4 antibody. Nuclear expression of GATA-4 was observed in P19(Shh) cells but not in P19(control) cells (Fig. 3, compare panel D with panel B). A Hoechst stain was included as a control for cell number and location of the nucleus. To further confirm the presence of muscle-specific structural proteins found in embryonic cardiac cells, we also stained for the expression of cardiac α-actin. As expected, cardiac α-actin was expressed in P19(Shh) cells and not in P19(control) cells (Fig. 3, compare panel H with panel F) and showed the characteristic morphology of cardiac muscle. To further dissect the Shh signaling pathway, Ptc1 and Gli1/2/3 transcripts were examined for changes in gene expression by Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2).

Intriguingly, systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the agonist for TLR4, confers a cardio-protective effect against ischemic injury. However, the mechanisms leading to the cardiac protection remain largely unknown. The present study was designed to investigate the role of TLR4 activation by LPS in protecting cardiomyocytes (CM) against apoptosis in an in vitro model of ischemia and to explore the downstream mechanisms leading to the protective effect. Incubation with LPS led to activation of IRAK-1 and protected CMs against serum deprivation (SD)-induced apoptosis as demonstrated by DNA laddering, histone-DNA fragment enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and activation of caspase-3. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and IκB kinase β appear to contribute to the anti-apoptotic effect of LPS since the specific inhibitors, wortmannin, PD98059, and dominant negative IKKβ transgene expression reversed the LPS effect. To assess whether LPS improves CM function, we examined intracellular Ca2+ transients and cell shortening in single adult rat CMs. SD for 6 h dramatically inhibited Ca2+ transients and CM contractility. LPS at 500 ng/ml significantly improved the [Ca2+]i transients and enhanced contractility in control CMs as well as in CMs subjected to SD. Importantly, transient ischemia led to rapid activation of IRAK-1 in cultured CMs and in adult rat myocardium. Adenovirus-mediated transgene expression of IRAK-1 but not its kinase-deficient mutant IRAK-1(K239S) protected CMs against SD-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these data suggest an important role of TLR4 signaling via IRAK-1 in protecting against SD-induced apoptosis.

Investig. 1994; 94: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is a tightly regulated and energy-dependent process that requires specialized cellular machinery. The central component of this machinery is a proteolytic system involving a family of proteases called caspases (11Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). The biochemical and cellular hallmarks of apoptosis are characterized by nuclear and DNA fragmentation and condensation, membrane blebbing, and cellular shrinkage. LPS signal transduction involves multiple signaling proteins such as LPS binding protein, CD14, MD-2, and TLR4. TLR4 dimerizes and becomes activated upon association with LPS·MD2·CD14 complex. Activated TLR4 recruits downstream the serine-threonine kinases, IRAKs, through the adapter protein MyD88. All IRAKs are multidomain proteins consisting of a conserved N-terminal death domain and a central kinase domain (12Janssens S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The death domain is a protein interaction motif implicated in binding of IRAKs to the upstream adapter protein MyD88. The recruited IRAK-1 becomes multiply phosphorylated, either by IRAK-1 itself or by IRAK-4. Phosphorylated IRAK-1 has reduced affinity for MyD88 and increased affinity for TRAF-6. A point mutation in the ATP binding pocket (K239S) creates a catalytically inactive IRAK-1, IRAK-1(K239S) (13Knop J. Martin M.U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). IRAK-1 and TRAF-6 complex then activate TAK1 through a process involving cytosol translocation of TAK1 and two TAK1-binding proteins from membrane to cytosol and ubiquitination of TRAF-6. Activated TAK1 then phosphorylates IKKα/β as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinases, leading to activation of NF-κB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/p38 MAPKs, respectively (14Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). LPS also activates ERK in macrophages (15Watters J.J. Sommer J.A.

Although innate immunity signaling components such as TLR4 are present predominantly in immune cells (17Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), other tissues and organs such as the heart also possess functionally intact innate immune systems (18Cowan D.B. Poutias D.N.

A growing body of evidence suggests that the myocardial innate immune system may play an important role in mediating the inflammatory response and modulating cardiac function in response to LPS (21Knuefermann P. Nemoto S. Misra A. Nozaki N. Defreitas G. Goyert S.M. Carabello B.A. Mann D.L. Vallejo J.G. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2608-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Baumgarten G.

Intriguingly, evidence from several lines of investigation suggests that LPS may activate intracellular survival mechanisms and protect the myocardium against ischemia and reperfusion injury. For example, in animal models, administration of LPS or its non-pyrogenic derivative mono-phosphoryl lipid A reduces cardiac arrhythmia and myocardial infarction after ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) (23Brown J.M. Grosso M.A. Terada L.S. Whitman G.J. Banerjee A. White C.W. Harken A.H. Repine J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2516-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 24Eising G.P.

Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In a rabbit model systemic administration of LPS before ischemia led to a reduction in infarct size by 54% (28Belosjorow S. Schulz R. Dorge H. Schade F.U. Heusch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2470-H2475PubMed Google Scholar). Using an ex vivo Langendorff model, Meng et al. (29Meng X. Ao L. Brown J.M. Meldrum D.R. Sheridan B.C. Cain B.S. Banerjee A. Harken A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1894-H1902PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that prior systemic treatment of rats with LPS led to an improved cardiac function during reperfusion phase after transient ischemic insult as compared with the control saline-treated rats. Although the cardio-protective effects of LPS against IRI are well documented, its effect on myocardial apoptosis is unclear. LPS has been shown to activate parallel pro-apoptotic and survival pathways in other cell types. Activation of TLR4 triggers expression of cell survival and inflammatory genes via NF-κB-dependent mechanisms, although in endothelial cells, NF-κB activity seems dispensable for the LPS-induced cytoprotective activity (16Wong F. Hull C. Zhande R. Law J. Karsan A. Blood. 2004; 103: 4520-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). LPS also activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways in some cell types (30Venkataraman C. Shankar G. Sen G. Bondada S. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 69: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31Vivarelli M.S. McDonald D. Miller M. Cusson N. Kelliher M. Geha R.S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells LPS induces apoptotic signaling through a mechanism involving TRAF-6-mediated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation (32Hull C. McLean G. Wong F. Duriez P.J. Karsan A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2611-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, LPS-induced apoptosis is often cell type-specific (most in endothelial cells) and depends on the simultaneous administration of cycloheximide or proteasome inhibitor to block the synthesis of endogenous survival molecules (33Bannerman D.D.

The survival signals in LPS-treated endothelial cells appear to include both an inducible and constitutively active components (34Bannerman D.D. Tupper J.C. Ricketts W.A. Bennett C.F. Winn R.K.

Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we examined the anti-apoptotic effect of TLR4 activation by LPS in an in vitro model of ischemia, i.e. hypoxia/serum deprivation (SD). LPS pretreatment led to improved survival and function of CMs subjected to SD. Employing transgene expression and pharmacological inhibitors, we explored the roles of IRAK-1 and other three survival molecules, Akt, ERK1/2, and IKKβ in LPS cardio-protective effects. Finally, we demonstrated that IRAK-1, an important component of TLR4 innate signaling, is dynamically activated in CMs subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation and in myocardium subjected to coronary artery ligation. These results suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect of LPS-TLR4 signaling may play an important role in protecting CMs and that the myocardial innate immune system involving IRAK-1 may represent an intrinsic mechanism of cardio-protection. Materials—LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4), collagenase, myelin basic protein, and β-actin antibody were from Sigma. Antibodies for cleaved caspase-3, Akt, P-Akt, and P-ERK were from Cell signaling (Beverly, MA), and antibodies for IRAK-1 were from Pro-Sci Co. (catalog number 1007) and Santa Cruz (F4, sc-5288), respectively. Wortmannin and PD98059 were from Calbiochem. Cell death detection ELISA kits were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Caspase-3 activity assay kits were from R&D Systems. Neonatal Rat CM Preparation—CMs were prepared from 1–2-day-old rats using collagenase and pancreatin. Briefly, the hearts were isolated, dissected from major vessels, and cut into small pieces. The heart tissues were then incubated in ADS buffer (116 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.8 mm Na2HPO4, 5.6 mm glucose, 5.4 mm KCl, and 0.8 mm MgSO4) containing 0.04% collagenase and 0.06% pancreatin (Worthington) at 37 °C for 20 min in a shaker. Cell suspension was slowly removed, and the remaining myocardial tissues were further incubated with the enzyme buffer. Cells in suspension were collected, spun, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 4.5% d-glucose. Fibroblasts were removed by plating cells on 10-cm dishes for 30 min. Neonatal CMs were then plated in Petri dishes and incubated in CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 3–4 days before experiments were performed. Adult Rat CM Isolation—Isolated adult ventricular cardiomyocytes were prepared using an enzymatic perfusion method as described by Martin et al. (36Martin B.J. Valdivia H.H. Bunger R. Lasley R.D. Mentzer Jr., R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H8-H17PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the heart was perfused with an enzyme solution containing 0.08% collagenase Type II (Worthington) and 0.04% hyaluronidase (Sigma) in oxygenated Ca2+-free Krebs-Henseleit solution. The heart was perfused for 25 min, and the resulting cell suspension was filtered and triturated with Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 0.5 mm Ca2+ for 5 min. The cells were spun down at 1000 rpm for 1 min and then resuspended in Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 1.0 mm Ca2+. Adult CMs were incubated in RPMI 1640 with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. In Vitro Model of Apoptosis and LPS Treatment—Three days after plating, cultured beating neonatal CMs were washed 3 times with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin and incubated in the same medium. In some experiments cell cultures were then placed in a hypoxic chamber filled with humidified flowing hypoxic gas (95% nitrogen and 5% CO2) at 37 °C for 4–6 h. Our previous studies have demonstrated that SD alone for 4–24 h induces significant caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. Hypoxia leads to only modest additional activation of caspase-3 and DNA laddering in the SD model (37Chao W. Shen Y. Li L. Rosenzweig A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31639-31645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Chao W. Matsui T. Novikov M.S. Tao J. Li L. Liu H. Ahn Y. Rosenzweig A. J. Gene Med. 2003; 5: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For LPS experiments, cell cultures were pre-treated with saline or LPS at the indicated concentrations for 60 min. Cells were then washed three times and then incubated with either regular serum-containing RPMI medium or serum-free medium depending on experimental design. Second doses of fresh LPS were added to cell cultures accordingly. In some experiments LPS was added at the time of SD without preincubation. Apoptosis/Cell Viability Assays—For DNA laddering, cells were lysed, and cellular DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform. 1.5 μg of genomic DNA fragments were treated with RNase, 32P-labeled by Klenow DNA polymerase, and then separated by electrophoresis in 1.8% agarose gel (37Chao W.

Rosenzweig A. J. Gene Med. 2003; 5: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For cell death ELISA, apoptosis-induced histone-DNA fragments were quantitated using cell death detection ELISA (37Chao W. Shen Y. Li L. Rosenzweig A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31639-31645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Chao W. Matsui T. Novikov M.S. Tao J. Li L. Liu H. Ahn Y. Rosenzweig A. J. Gene Med. 2003; 5: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For caspase activity assays, caspase-3 activity was examined by using the caspase colorimetric assay kit from R&D Systems as previously described (37Chao W. Shen Y. Li L. Rosenzweig A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31639-31645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the MTT assay, neonatal CMs cultured in 24-well plates (6 × 105/well) were incubated in either regular RPMI medium or serum-free medium as indicated for 6 h. At the end of incubation, 1.5 ml of fresh regular RPMI medium containing 0.05% MTT was added into each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The MTT-containing medium was then removed, 1.5 ml of Me2SO was added in each well, and absorbance was measured at 570 nm. Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, and IRAK-1 Kinase Assay— CMs (∼2 × 106 cells) were scraped from 60-mm dishes in RPMI 1640 medium, spun down, and washed once with 15 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets or freshly frozen rat myocardial tissue (see “In Vivo Model of Ischemia Reperfusion”) were dissolved in 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaVO3, 1 mm NaF, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin) and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell lysate was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and supernatant was removed. For immunoprecipitation, 2.5 μg of polyclonal anti-IRAK-1 antibody (Pro-Sci Co.) was added to cell lysates containing equal amount of proteins and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h or overnight on a rotator. To harvest IRAK-1-antibody complex, 50 μl of pre-washed 50% slurry protein G (Amersham Biosciences) was added, incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, spun down at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge, and washed 4 times with cold lysis buffer. Half of the protein G beads were used for IRAK-1 Western blotting (F4 antibody from Santa Cruz) as described previously (39Li L. Cousart S. Hu J. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The remaining beads were washed twice and incubated in 110 μl of kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaVO3, and 1 mm benzamidine). To start IRAK-1 kinase assay, 2 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma), 5 μm cold ATP, and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added to 110 μl of immunoprecipitates and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. At the end of the assay, immunoprecipitates were mixed with SDS sample buffer, heated, and separated in 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE. 32P-Labeled MBP was visualized by autoradiography. Measurement of Ca2+ Transient and Cell Shortening—Adult CMs were loaded with 5 μm Fluo 4-AM (Molecular Probe) at room temperature for 20 min. Cells attached to the coverslip were continuously perfused with Tyrode solution (130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 4 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 22 mm glucose, 0.01 μg/ml insulin, pH 7.4 with NaOH) and electrically stimulated (0.5 Hz, 35 V, 100 ms). Ca2+ transients were measured using a Nikon Diaphot confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MR-1). Fluo 4-AM was excited at 488 nm, with emitted fluorescence measured at 515 nm. All images were taken in the line-scan mode (2 ms/line, 0.1–0.3 μm/pixel, with the scan line oriented along the long axis of CM, avoiding the nuclei of the cell). Ca2+ transients were analyzed with an automated computer program. All experiments were performed at room temperature. In Vivo Model of Ischemia Reperfusion—Sprague-Dawley rats (200–300 g) were anesthetized, and midline sternotomy was performed (38Chao W. Matsui T. Novikov M.S. Tao J. Li L. Liu H. Ahn Y. Rosenzweig A. J. Gene Med. 2003; 5: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). LAD was ligated with silk suture (5.0) ∼4 mm from its origin with a slipknot. Ischemia was confirmed by myocardial bleaching. 5 min into ischemia, fluorescent microspheres (300 μl, 10-μm FluoSpheres, Molecular Probes) were injected into the left ventricle cavity. For IRI, after 30 min the LAD ligature was released, and reperfusion was visually confirmed. For straight infarct, a permanent tie was used instead of a slipknot. In the sham-operated animals, a slipknot tie was passed under the LAD but not tied. To harvest heart tissues, animals were anesthetized and exsanguinated. The heart was removed, and ventricular chambers were opened, washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for subsequent DNA/protein analysis and IRAK kinase assay. Recombinant Adenoviral Vector—All Ad constructs have been made using the pAdEasy system as described (40He T. Zhou S. da Costa L. Yu J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar) and have been characterized. These included Ad vectors carrying cDNAs for IRAK-1, kinase-deficient mutant IRAK-1(K239S), IKKβ-dn (41Meiler S.E. Hung R.R. Gerszten R.E. Gianetti J. Li L. Matsui T. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Rosenzweig A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 349-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and β-galactosidase/green fluorescent protein (controls). cDNAs for IRAK-1 and IKKβ-dn were kindly provided by Dr. Z. Cao and Dr. D. Goeddel, respectively, at Tularik. High titer stocks were prepared, and expression was confirmed in neonatal and/or adult CMs in vitro and in rat myocardium in vivo. Wild-type Ad contamination was excluded by the absence of PCR-detectable E1 sequences. Statistics—Unless stated otherwise, all data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments and were analyzed with a two-tailed, unpaired Student's t test. The null hypothesis was rejected for p < 0.05. LPS Induces IRAK-1 Activation and Protects CMs against Hypoxia/SD-induced CM Apoptosis—We have established an in vitro kinase assay for IRAK-1 both in isolated neonatal rat CMs and in adult rat myocardium to test innate immunity signaling. As shown in Fig. 1, LPS activated IRAK-1 kinase in cultured CMs with enhanced phosphorylation of MBP. The IRAK-1 kinase activity was specific for the LPS-TLR4-signaling pathway as TNFα failed to stimulate IRAK-1 activity. A similar concentration of TNFα leads to NF-κB activation as demonstrated by gel shift (data not shown). The LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of MBP was dependent on IRAK-1, as the immunoprecipitates with control rabbit IgG from the LPS-stimulated CMs did not show any increase in IRAK-1 activity as compared with the nonspecific background (Fig. 1A). LPS activates IRAK-1 rapidly, reaching the peak within 30 min (Fig. 1B). An in vitro model of hypoxia and re-oxygenation was used to mimic in vivo ischemia and involved a brief incubation of CMs in SD and hypoxic conditions. The in vitro model has been demonstrated to induce significant CM apoptosis (37Chao W. Shen Y. Li L. Rosenzweig A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31639-31645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Chao W. Matsui T. Novikov M.S. Tao J. Li L. Liu H. Ahn Y. Rosenzweig A. J. Gene Med. 2003; 5: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the combination of hypoxia and serum deprivation for 24 h led to an increase in DNA laddering, and treatment of CMs with LPS at the time of SD substantially inhibited DNA fragmentation. Quantitative analysis using histone-DNA fragment ELISA further demonstrated that hypoxia/SD induced up to an 8.2-fold increase in DNA fragmentation within 9 h in CMs and a 2.4-fold increase in human umbilical vein endothelial cells within 5 h. LPS significantly inhibited hypoxia/SD-induced apoptosis by 45% in cultured rat CMs but failed to inhibit apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, suggesting the cyto-protective effect of LPS is cell type-specific (Fig. 2B). To further explore the anti-apoptotic effect of LPS, caspase-3 cleavage and activity were measured. LPS dramatically inhibited the pro-caspase-3 cleavage in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Similar to what we documented previously (37Chao W. Shen Y. Li L. Rosenzweig A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31639-31645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), hypoxia/SD induced a time-dependent cleavage and activation of pro-caspase-3, both of which were correlated well with each other. LPS treatment led to a decrease in caspase-3 activity for up to 6 h of SD (Fig. 2, D and E). Consistent with its anti-apoptotic effect, LPS also improved the viability of serum-deprived CMs as demonstrated by MTT assay (Fig. 2F). LPS Improves Function of Adult CMs Subjected to SD—To learn whether activation of TLR4 innate signaling by LPS improves CM function in an in vitro model of ischemia, cultured adult rat CMs were pre-treated with LPS (500 ng/ml) or saline for 1 h in regular RPMI, washed, and incubated in the presence or absence of serum as indicated. Additional doses of LPS or saline were added after the wash. Five hours later [Ca2+]i transients were recorded (Fig. 3-A). It is noteworthy that only beating CMs were chosen to record [Ca2+]i transients and cell contractility in all four groups of CMs. Three-dimensional graphics as changes of fluorescence ratio ΔF/F0 (F0 is the base-line Ca2+ signal before depolarization, ΔF = F – F0) is presented in Fig. 3B. The average amplitudes (ΔF/F0) of Ca2+ transients from control CMs (+serum, saline, n = 36) was 3.1 ± 0.45 (Fig. 3C), the time-to-peak Ca2+ was 138 ± 41 ms (Fig. 3D), the time constant (τ) during reuptake and relaxation was 299 ± 65 ms (Fig. 3E), and the cell shortening was 10.1 ± 1.5% (Fig. 3F). Surprisingly, CMs treated with 500 ng/ml LPS in normal serum-containing conditions (+serum, LPS, 6 h, n = 31) demonstrated improved Ca2+ homeostasis and contractility with a 19% increase in the average amplitudes of Ca2+ (Fig. 3C), a 23% decrease in the time-to-peak Ca2+ (Fig. 3D), and a 35% increase in the cell shortening (Fig. 3F) but no signifi"

They can also affect it indirectly by changing the scattering properties of clouds and, because desert dusts are particularly active ice-forming agents, by affecting the formation and thermodynamic phase of clouds.

https://openalex.org/W2100773246,"The crucial functions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and endothelial nitric oxide/NO in the regulation of arterial blood pressure have been emphasized by the hypertensive phenotype of mice with systemic inactivation of either the guanylyl cyclase-A receptor for ANP (GC-A-/-) or endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS-/-). Intriguingly, similar levels of arterial hypertension are accompanied by marked cardiac hypertrophy in GC-A-/-, but not in eNOS-/-, mice, suggesting that changes in local pathways regulating cardiac growth accelerate cardiac hypertrophy in the former and protect the heart of the latter. Our recent observations in mice with conditional, cardiomyocyte-restricted GC-A deletion demonstrated that ANP locally inhibits cardiomyocyte growth. Abolition of these local, protective effects may enhance the cardiac hypertrophic response of GC-A-/- mice to persistent increases in hemodynamic load. Notably, eNOS-/- mice exhibit markedly increased cardiac ANP levels, suggesting that increased activation of cardiac GC-A can prevent hypertensive heart disease. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice with systemic inactivation of eNOS and cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of GC-A by crossing eNOS-/- and cardiomyocyte-restricted GC-A-deficient mice. Cardiac deletion of GC-A did not affect arterial hypertension but significantly exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in eNOS-/- mice. This was accompanied by marked cardiac activation of both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK 1/2 and the phosphatase calcineurin.

The heart is involved in cardiovascular homeostasis by the secretion of two natriuretic peptides, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) 1The abbreviations used are: ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; GC-A, guanylyl cyclase-A; CM GC-A KO, cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of GC-A; eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; MHC, myosin heavy chain; α-sk-actin, α-skeletal actin; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; CM, cardiomyocyte; HW, heart weight; LVW, left ventricular weight; BW, body weight. and B-type natriuretic peptide (1De Bold A.J. Borenstein H.B. Veress A.T. Sonnenberg H. Life Sci. 1981; 28: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2664) Google Scholar). Natriuretic peptides activate a common guanylyl cyclase A (GC-A) receptor expressed in a wide variety of tissues, which results in elevation of intracellular cGMP concentrations (2Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocrine Rev. 1994; 13: 135-162Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 3Kuhn M. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). ANP is secreted from atrial granules into the circulation in response to acute or chronic atrial stretch, where it functions as an antihypertensive and antihypervolemic factor through GC-A in distant organs (3Kuhn M. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 700-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In chronic hemodynamic overload, there is a significant increase in ANP and, in particular, B-type natriuretic peptide expression in the cardiac ventricles (4De Bold A.J. Ma K.K. Zhang Y. de Bold M.L. Bensimon M. Khoshbaten A. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2001; 79: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is postulated that in this situation natriuretic peptides not only act as endocrine factors but also exert local antihypertrophic (ANP) and antifibrotic (B-type natriuretic peptides) actions (5Tamura N. Ogawa Y. Chusho H. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Suda M. Kasahara M. Hashimoto R. Katsuura G. Mukoyama M. Itoh H. Saito Y. Tanaka I. Otani H. Katsuki M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4239-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). For example, ANP counters hypertrophic growth of cultured cardiac myocytes and proliferation of fibroblasts via GC-A (6Calderone A. Thaik C.M. Takahashi N. Chang D.L. Colucci W.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In addition, targeted overexpression of GC-A in cardiomyocytes exerts antihypertrophic effects in vivo (7Kishimoto I. Rossi K. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2703-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Conversely, mice with a genetic, systemic disruption of the GC-A gene (GC-A-/- mice) not only have increased systemic blood pressure but also display a marked cardiac hypertrophy that is disproportionate to their increased blood pressure and is resistant to antihypertensive medication (8Lopez M.J. Wong S.K. Kishimoto I. Dubois S. Mach V. Friesen J. Garbers D.L. Beuve A. Nature. 1995; 378: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 9Knowles J.W. Esposito G. Mao L. Hagaman J.R. Fox J.E. Smithies O. Rockman H.W. Maeda N. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 975-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). By comparison, other mutant mice with similar increases in blood pressure, i.e. mice with systemic disruption of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS-/-), do not have this pronounced hypertrophic phenotype (10Huang L.A.

Bidmon H.-J. Gödecke S. Schrader J. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus, hearts from GC-A-deficient mice seem to be abnormally susceptible to the development of cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload, corroborating the hypothesis that ANP, via GC-A, counterregulates cardiomyocyte growth in a local, paracrine/autocrine way. Indeed, our observation that mice with conditional, (αMHC-CRE recombinase/loxP-mediated) cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of GC-A (CM GC-A KO mice) exhibit blood pressure-independent cardiac hypertrophy, provided final proof to this concept (13Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F. Schneider M.D. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the antihypertrophic effects of ANP remain completely uncharacterized. Here we sought to determine the mechanisms by which local ANP/GC-A signaling moderates basal cardiomyocyte growth and the cardiac growth response to chronic arterial hypertension. To investigate the impact of a loss of function of cardiomyocyte GC-A on the development of hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte (CM)-specific GC-A KO mice (13Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F. Schneider M.D. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) were crossed with mice deficient in endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS-/-), a model with chronic arterial hypertension (12Gödecke A. Decking U.K.M. Ding Z. Hirchenhain J. Bidmon H.-J. Gödecke S. Schrader J. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This genetic approach was based on the observations that eNOS-/- mice exhibit modest cardiac hypertrophy (10Huang L.A. Huang Z. Mashimo H. Bloch K.D. Moskowitz M.A. Bevan J.A. Fishmanm M.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar, 11Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laubach V.E. Sherman P.A. Sessa W.C. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Physiol. 2000; 278: H971-H981PubMed Google Scholar and this study), suggesting that increased local ANP can ameliorate hypertensive cardiac remodeling. Indeed, our studies indicate that ANP/GC-A/cyclic GMP signaling functions as a local cardiac system that can inhibit both MAPK/ERK- and calcineurin/NFAT-dependent pathways of cardiomyocyte growth. Animals—CM GC-A KO and eNOS-/- mice were generated by methods described previously (12Gödecke A. Decking U.K.M. Ding Z. Hirchenhain J. Bidmon H.-J. Gödecke S. Schrader J. Circ.

Control (floxed GC-A mice with normal GC-A and eNOS expression levels), CM GC-A KO (floxed GC-A mice harboring the αMHC-CRE recombinase), eNOS-/- (floxed GC-A mice with normal GC-A expression levels and systemic disruption of eNOS), and double KO mice (eNOS-/-, CM GC-A KO) used in the present study were generated from heterozygous mice after crossbreeding single eNOS-/- (12Gödecke A. Decking U.K.M. Ding Z. Hirchenhain J. Bidmon H.-J. Gödecke S. Schrader J. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and CM GC-A KO mice (13Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F. Schneider M.D. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The animals were in a mixed genetic background (C57BL/6 × 129SV). Male and female littermates ∼6–8 months old were examined. The animals were housed under a 12-h day/night cycle and fed a standard diet containing 0.6% NaCl (normal salt conditions). Genotypes were identified by PCR analyses of tail-tip DNA. All experimental protocols were approved by the local animal care committee and conform with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U. S. National Institutes of Health (Publication No. 85–23, revised 1996). Hemodynamic Measurements and Tissue Harvesting—Heart rate and diastolic and systolic blood pressure were measured in conscious mice by tail cuff (Softron, Tokyo) (15Kuhn M. Holtwick R. Baba H.A. Perriard J.-C. Schmitz W. Ehler E. Heart. 2002; 87: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mice were then sacrificed, the hearts were weighed, and the atria and right ventricular free wall (RV) were dissected away from the left ventricle (LV) inclusive of the septum (13Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F. Schneider M.D. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 15Kuhn M. Holtwick R. Baba H.A. Perriard J.-C. Schmitz W. Ehler E. Heart. 2002; 87: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The ratios of whole heart and left ventricular weights to the body weight (HW/BW and LVW/BW) were calculated and used as an index of cardiac enlargement. The left ventricles were bisected and frozen in liquid nitrogen (for RNA or protein extraction) and fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde (for histology). Histology and Morphometrical Analyses—Formaldehyde-fixed ventricles were embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin eosin, periodic acid Schiff (to discriminate cardiomyocyte cell borders), or 0.1% picrosirius red (for collagen). Photomicrographs of the sections were evaluated by a computer-assisted image analysis system (VIDAS 25; Zeiss) (13Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F.

Heart. 2002; 87: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), with the investigator blinded to the genotypes. The mean cross-sectional cardiomyocyte diameters were calculated by measuring 100 cells with a centrally located nucleus per specimen. Interstitial collagen fractions were obtained by calculating the ratio, in percent, between the collagen area and the total ventricular area in the corresponding section (13Holtwick R. van Eickels M.

Perriard J.-C. Schmitz W. Ehler E. Heart. 2002; 87: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from the left ventricle by use of TRIzol (Invitrogen). Ventricular mRNA levels of ANP, α-skeletal actin (α-sk-actin), α- and β-myosin heavy chain (α/β-MHC) were determined from 20 μg of total RNA (13Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A.

Ehler E. Heart. 2002; 87: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using Northern blot analysis. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used for normalization. Specific mouse ANP, α-sk-actin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes (15Kuhn M. Holtwick R. Baba H.A. Perriard J.-C. Schmitz W. Ehler E. Heart. 2002; 87: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Oligonucleotides for α-MHC and β-MHC were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Radioactive signals were visualized in a PhosphorImager™ and quantified by the ImageQuant software (13Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F.

Heart. 2002; 87: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Frozen left ventricles were homogenized and proteins were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The primary antibodies were against phosphorylated forms of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK 1/ERK 2, p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and against the MAPK phosphatase MKP-1 (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Igs. All signals were normalized to the cardiomyocyte-specific protein junctin (16Kirchhefer U. Neumann J. Baba H.A.

To analyze the activation status of endogenous calcineurin, the relative phosphorylation status of its endogenous transcriptional effector, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), was determined as described previously in detail (17Van Rooij E. Doevendans P.A. Crijns H.J.G.M. Heeneman S. Lips D.J. van Bilsen M. Williams R.S. Olson E.N. Bassel-Duby R. Rothermel B.A. De Windt L.J. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: e18-e26Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In brief, left ventricular frozen samples were lysed in ice-cold buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 g/ml leupeptin, 10 g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 2 g/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Protein concentration in lysates was determined using a protein dye assay (Bio-Rad). 400 mg of ventricular protein extract was immunoprecipitated overnight with either a monoclonal anti-NFATc2 antibody (sc-7925; Santa Cruz) or a monoclonal anti-NFATc4 antibody (H-74; Santa Cruz) and protein A/G-agarose. Immunoprecipitates were separated on gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Filters were blocked for 1 h at room temperature using 10% nonfat dry milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Primary antibody was a rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-serine antibody (ab9332; Abcam). To evaluate the total amount of immunoprecipitated NFATc2 and c4, the blots were stripped and reprobed with polyclonal antibodies against c2 or c4, respectively. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) (17Van Rooij E. Doevendans P.A. Crijns H.J.G.M. Heeneman S. Lips D.J. van Bilsen M. Williams R.S. Olson E.N.

All data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test, with the exception of the results from Northern and Western blot analyses, which were evaluated by Student′s t-Test. Results were considered statistically significant in all analyses at p <0.05. Cardiomyocyte-restricted Deletion of GC-A Does Not Affect Arterial Hypertension but Provokes Cardiac Enlargement in eNOS-/- Mice—In accordance with our previous study (13Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F. Schneider M.D. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), the average diastolic and systolic blood pressure level of CM GC-A KO mice tended to be slightly lower as compared with control mice (Fig. 1). Both eNOS-/- and double KO mice were clearly hypertensive, with increased diastolic blood pressure (by 12 ± 3 and 9 ± 1.7 mm Hg, respectively) and systolic blood pressure levels (by 31 ± 6 and 28 ± 2 mm Hg) as compared with controls (Fig. 1). This increase is comparable with that originally seen in eNOS-/- mice (12Gödecke A. Decking U.K.M. Ding Z. Hirchenhain J. Bidmon H.-J. Gödecke S. Schrader J. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in heart rate between control and CM GC-A KO mice (635 ± 21 and 597 ± 9 bpm). In contrast, arterial hypertension in eNOS-/- and double KO mice was accompanied by significant bradycardia (519 ± 15 and 535 ± 5 bpm, respectively; both p <0.01 versus controls). There was no difference in blood pressure or heart rate between sexes. Even under conditions of slight arterial hypotension, CM GC-A KO mice showed increased HW/BW and LVW/BW ratios as compared with controls (by 28.5 and 22%, respectively; see Fig. 2). HW/BW and LVW/BW were only marginally, but not significantly, increased in eNOS-/- mice (by 12.7 and 11.1%) but markedly increased in double KO mice (by 61.4 and 48%) as compared with control mice (Fig. 2). Thus, although eNOS-/- mice have chronic arterial hypertension, they only display moderate cardiac enlargement. In contrast, cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of GC-A leads to significant left ventricular enlargement already under normal (CM GC-A KO) and even more under increased pressure load conditions (double KO mice). Cardiomyocyte-restricted Deletion of GC-A Causes Excessive Left Ventricular Remodeling in eNOS-/- Mice—To determine whether cardiomyocyte GC-A deletion and/or systemic eNOS ablation influenced individual cardiomyocyte size, we next measured myofiber diameters on periodic acid Schiff-stained left ventricular paraffin sections. The average diameter was significantly increased in CM GC-A KO mice (15.9 ± 0.01 mm) as compared with controls (12.6 ± 0.2 mm), whereas cardiomyocytes from eNOS-/- mice were slightly, but not significantly, enlarged (13.3 ± 1 mm) (Fig. 3). Cardiomyocytes from double KO mice were markedly hypertrophic (average diameter 17.7 ± 0.3 mm) as compared with all three other genotypes (Fig. 3). Sirius red stainings showed that left ventricular interstitial collagen fractions were not different between control, CM GC-A KO, and eNOS-/- mice (Fig. 4). Notably, in left ventricles of double KO mice interstitial collagen fractions were almost doubled (Fig. 4), indicating increased proliferation and/or collagen production of fibroblasts. Thus, hypertensive eNOS-/- mice are protected from cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and abolition of the local effects of ANP removes this protection.Fig. 4Morphometrical analyses of cardiac sections. Total interstitial collagen fractions were estimated by quantitative morphometry of sirius red-stained ventricular sections of control (n = 8), CM GC-A KO (n = 7), eNOS-/- (n = 12), and double KO mice (n = 11). *, p <0.05 versus all other genotypes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cardiac Hypertrophy in Double KO Mice Is Accompanied by Increased Expression of Hypertrophy Marker Genes—Because cardiac hypertrophy is accompanied by an activation of the cardiac fetal gene program in the ventricle, we next examined ventricular mRNA expression of ANP, α- and β-MHC, and α-sk-actin. Left ventricular ANP mRNA levels in eNOS-/- mice were ∼3-fold higher as compared with controls (Fig. 5). The levels of α-sk-actin and α-MHC were not significantly altered, but the expression levels of β-MHC and the ratios β-MHC/α-MHC were significantly increased (by ∼1.6- and 1.4-fold, respectively) (Fig. 5). These changes in gene expression levels were even more pronounced in the double KO mice (increases in cardiac ANP mRNA by 2.5-fold, β-MHC mRNA by 2.4-fold, and β/α-MHC by 5-fold as compared with eNOS-/- mice) (Fig. 5). Thus, ablation of cardiomyocyte ANP/GC-A signaling enhances the reactivation of the fetal gene program in hearts of eNOS-/- mice. Cardiac Hypertrophy in Double KO Mice Is Accompanied by Increased Activation of the Mitogen-activated Protein Kinases ERK 1/2 and the Phosphatase Calcineurin—To characterize the intermediate intracellular signaling factors that ultimately drive the hypertrophic response in CM GC-A KO and double KO mice, we first examined the phosphorylation state of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) ERK 1/2, JNK 1/2, and p38. As shown in Fig. 6, the cardiac expression levels of phosphorylated p38 and JNK 1/2 were not different between controls and transgenic mice of the three different genotypes (Fig. 6, A–C). However, we observed a significant increase in the cardiac levels of the dually phosphorylated (Thr-202/Tyr-204), active forms of ERK 1 and ERK 2 in hearts of CM GC-A KO mice (by ∼1.4-fold, see Fig. 6A), and of double KO mice (by 3.2-fold, Fig. 6C) as compared with controls. In contrast, no significant changes in ERK 1/2 phosphorylation levels were detected in hearts from eNOS-/- as compared with control mice (Fig. 6B). Because ANP was shown to induce the expression levels of MKP-1, a specific phosphatase that suppresses MAPK activity (18Sugimoto T. Haneda M. Togawa M. Isono M. Shikano T. Araki S.-I. Nakagawa T. Kashiwagi A. Guan K.-L. Kikkawa R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 544-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we also examined cardiac MKP-1 expression but failed to observe significant genotype-dependent variations (Figs. 6, A–C). Lastly, we studied myocardial calcineurin activity. Because activated calcineurin dephosphorylates members of the NFAT family, two endogenous NFAT isoforms, NFATc2 and NFATc4, were analyzed for their relative phosphorylation status. Both NFATc2 and NFATc4 were present in a hyperphosphorylated (inactive) state in hearts of control, CM GC-A KO, and eNOS-/- mice, consistent with a relatively low calcineurin activity (Fig. 7). In contrast, the cardiac levels of phospho-NFATc2 and phospho-NFAT-c4 were decreased by ∼77 and 59% in double KO mice, respectively, consistent with relatively higher endogenous calcineurin activity (Fig. 7). Collectively, these results indicate that cardiac hypertrophy in normotensive CM GC-A KO mice is accompanied by activation of ERK 1/2, whereas calcineurin-NFAT signaling is unaltered. In contrast, the more pronounced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in hypertensive double KO mice is associated with marked activation of both the MAPK ERK 1/2 and the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathways. We used a genetic approach to study the impact of a loss of function of the local, cardiac ANP/GC-A system on cardiac remodeling under normotensive and hypertensive conditions and to uncover the intracellular mechanisms responsible for its purported protective effects. Despite normal or even diminished arterial blood pressure, CM GC-A KO mice exhibit subtle but significant cardiac hypertrophy associated with slight MAPK/ERK 1/2 activation and unaltered calcineurin-NFAT activity. Despite elevated arterial blood pressure, eNOS-/- mice do not show cardiac remodeling or increased cardiac activity of the MAPK and calcineurin-NFAT cascades. However, selective inactivation of the GC-A receptor in cardiomyocytes of hypertensive eNOS-/- mice (double KO) results in pronounced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, which is accompanied by marked activation of both ERK 1/2 and the phosphatase calcineurin. The selective activation of the MAPK ERK 1/2 is consistent with a series of recent reports indicating that the stress-activated protein kinases JNK and p38 may actually serve as negative (not positive) regulators of pathologic cardiac hypertrophy (comprehensively reviewed in Refs. 19Bueno O.F. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar and 20Liang Q. Molkentin J.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1385-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ERK 1/2 and calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathways likely occupy a central co-regulatory, cooperative, and even interconnected position in almost every form of reactive, i.e. in load-induced cardiac hypertrophy (21Molkentin J.D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 22Sanna B. Bueno O.F. Dai Y.-S. Wilkins B.J. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 865-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that local ANP/GC-A signaling counter-regulates MAPK/ERK-mediated cardiomyocyte growth already under basal, normal pressure load conditions. Even more, ANP, via GC-A, can prevent cardiac activation of ERK 1/2 and calcineurin in response to enhanced pressure load. Lastly, our observations also suggest that increased cardiac ANP expression in eNOS-/- mice provides an endogenous protective pathway preventing hypertensive heart disease. In past years, the role of nitric oxide in the regulation of cardiac remodeling has been extensively investigated. Both neuronal and endothelial (eNOS) nitric-oxide synthases are constitutively expressed within the heart, in cardiomyocytes and adjacent cells (23Balligand J.L. Cannon P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1846-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 24Barouch L.A. Harrison R.W. Skaf M.W. Rosas G.O. Cappola T.P. Kobeissi Z.A. Hobai I.A. Lemmon C.A. Burnett A.L. O′Rourke B. Rodriguez E.R. Huang P.L. Lima J.A.C. Berkowith D.E. Hare J.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 337-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies with cultured cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes suggested that nitric oxide can inhibit cardiac fibrosis (6Calderone A. Thaik C.M. Takahashi N. Chang D.L. Colucci W.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 25Wang D. Yu X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33027-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (6Calderone A. Thaik C.M. Takahashi N. Chang D.L. Colucci W.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 26Ritchie R.H. Schiebinger R.J. La Pointe M.C. Marsh J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1370-H1374PubMed Google Scholar). However, the relevance of these findings to the in vivo situation is unclear. Three independent eNOS-/- mouse lines have been generated by gene targeting (10Huang L.A. Huang Z. Mashimo H. Bloch K.D. Moskowitz M.A. Bevan J.A. Fishmanm M.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar, 11Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laubach V.E. Sherman P.A.

Schrader J. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and studies in all three lines consistently demonstrated that the lack of eNOS increases mean arterial blood pressure, on average by ∼30 mm Hg. However, very discrepant observations regarding the cardiac phenotype of eNOS-/- mice have been made. Surprisingly, the mouse lines generated by Huang et al. (10Huang L.A. Huang Z. Mashimo H. Bloch K.D. Moskowitz M.A. Bevan J.A. Fishmanm M.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar) and Gödecke et al. (12Gödecke A. Decking U.K.M. Ding Z. Hirchenhain J. Bidmon H.-J. Gödecke S. Schrader J. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) do not consistently develop cardiac hypertrophy under baseline conditions, despite chronic arterial hypertension (27Ichinose F. Bloch K.D. Wu J.C. Hataishi R. Aretz H.T. Picard M.H. Scherrer-Crosbie M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H1070-H1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, the eNOS-/- line established by Shesely et al. (11Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laubach V.E. Sherman P.A. Sessa W.C. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13176-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) exhibits significant cardiac hypertrophy. The reasons for this discrepancy remain unclear, but taken together they seem to indicate that either nitric oxide is not a critical local modulator of cell growth within the heart and/or that other endogenous antihypertrophic mechanisms are able to compensate for a loss of function of eNOS in vivo. Based on published (14Gyurko R. Kuhlencordt P. Fishman M.C. Huang P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H971-H981PubMed Google Scholar) and own observations of increased, ectopic ANP mRNA expression levels in the left ventricular myocardium of eNOS-/- mice (see Fig. 5), we hypothesized that enhanced local ANP/GC-A signaling may confer endogenous protection. Indeed, our genetic experiment, in which absence of cardiomyocyte GC-A markedly exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in eNOS-/- mice, indicates that the increased local ANP levels play a significant local role in preventing hypertensive ventricular remodeling in the latter. The downstream signaling pathways that mediate the effects of the ANP/GC-A/cGMP system on ERK 1/2 and calcineurin activity in cardiomyocytes remain unclear and will be an important question for our future studies. In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells ANP directly inhibits MAPK activation via cGMP (28Sharma G.D. Nguyen H.T. Antonov A.S. Gerrity R.G. von Geldern T. Pandey K.N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 233: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, ANP was shown to induce the expression of MKP-1, a specific phosphatase that suppresses MAPK and, in particular, ERK 1/2 activity (18Sugimoto T. Haneda M. Togawa M. Isono M. Shikano T. Araki S.-I. Nakagawa T. Kashiwagi A. Guan K.-L. Kikkawa R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 544-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe decreases in cardiac MKP-1 expression in double KO as compared with control mice. Neuroendocrine growth factors that typically stimulate ERK 1/2 signaling in cardiac myocytes via G protein-coupled receptors are angiotensin II, endothelin, and catecholamines. ANP inhibits not only the vasoconstrictor and hypertrophic effects of these factors but also their levels of expression and release (29Fujisaki H. Ito H. Hirata Y. Tanaka M. Hata M. Lin M. Adachi S. Akimoto H. Marumo F. Hiroe M. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that cardiomyocyte GC-A dysfunction and the subsequent local functional imbalance between ANP and these neuroendocrine growth factors leads to increased activation of ERK 1/2 and thereby to pressure-independent cardiac hypertrophy. Notably, although the normotensive CM GC-A KO mice showed only moderate cardiac MAPK/ERK 1/2 activation, unaltered calcineurin-NFAT activity, and modest cardiac hypertrophy, hypertensive double KO mice exhibited greater MAPK/ERK 1/2 activation together with elevated calcineurin activity, and this was associated with pronounced cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, similar levels of arterial hypertension in eNOS-/- mice were not accompanied by cardiac ERK 1/2 and/or calcineurin activation or by cardiac hypertrophy. Taken together, these results suggest that increased local ANP/GC-A signaling (e.g. in eNOS-/- mice) can prevent the activation of ERK 1/2 and calcineurin in response to hemodynamic load and thereby ameliorate hypertensive hypertrophy. Abolition of this local protective pathway (e.g. in double KO mice) facilitates load-induced activation of ERK 1/2 and calcineurin in cardiomyocytes, where these pathways directly coregulate the hypertrophic growth response (22Sanna B. Bueno O.F. Dai Y.-S. Wilkins B.J. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 865-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been suggested that calcineurin is inactive in an unstimulated heart, given the observation that dominant negative calcineurin-expressing transgenic mice have similar calcineurin phosphatase activity compared with wild-type controls (31Zou Y. Hiroi Y. Uozumi H. Takimoto E. Toko H. Zhu W. Kudoh S. Mizukami M. Shimoyama M. Shibasaki F. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Circulation. 2001; 104: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, how GC-A/cGMP signaling counteracts load-induced activation of ERK 1/2 and calcineurin is unclear. Activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase I might be involved because it was shown that activation of this kinase inhibits calcineurin-NFAT signaling in cultured cardiomyocytes in part by inhibiting L-type Ca2+ channels (32Fiedler B. Lohmann S.M. Smolenski A. Linnemuller S. Pieske B. Schroder F. Molkentin J.D. Drexler H. Wollert K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Deletion of cardiomyocyte GC-A in eNOS-/- mice (double KO) not only accentuated cardiac hypertrophy but also markedly enhanced the fibrotic response to pressure overload. These findings extend our previous observations of increased interstitial fibrosis in CM GC-A KO mice after transverse aortic banding (13Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F. Schneider M.D. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). GC-A receptors are present on fibroblasts and mediate anti-fibrotic effects (6Calderone A. Thaik C.M. Takahashi N. Chang D.L. Colucci W.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 29Fujisaki H. Ito H. Hirata Y. Tanaka M. Hata M. Lin M. Adachi S. Akimoto H. Marumo F. Hiroe M. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and should not have been affected by our strategy of conditional, cardiomyocyte-restricted gene deletion. Thus, increased fibrosis after deletion of cardiomyocyte GC-A is most likely mediated by an effect on cardiomyocyte production of pro- or anti-fibrotic factors. Cardiomyocytes produce angiotensin II (33Li Y. Kishimoto I. Saito Y. Harada M. Kuwahara K. Izumi T. Takahashi N. Kawakami R. Tanimoto K. Nakagawa Y. Nakanishi M. Adachi Y. Garbers D.L. Fukamizu A. Nakao K. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1722-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β (34Rosenkranz S. Cardiovascular Res. 2004; 63: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and maybe even aldosterone (35Ito T. Yoshimura M. Nakamura S. Nakayama M. Shimasaki Y. Harada E. Mizuno Y. Yamamuro M. Harada M. Saito Y. Nakao K. Kurihara H. Yasue H. Ogawa H. Circulation. 2003; 107: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and these and other profibrotic and proinflammatory factors may be regulated by natriuretic peptides via GC-A (29Fujisaki H. Ito H. Hirata Y. Tanaka M. Hata M. Lin M. Adachi S. Akimoto H. Marumo F. Hiroe M. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 35Ito T. Yoshimura M. Nakamura S. Nakayama M. Shimasaki Y. Harada E. Mizuno Y. Yamamuro M. Harada M. Saito Y. Nakao K. Kurihara H. Yasue H. Ogawa H. Circulation. 2003; 107: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, in future studies this model provides an opportunity to explore the effects of ANP on cardiomyocyte-fibroblast interactions. ANP is a robust marker of cardiac hypertrophy, which always increases early during induction and decreases during regression of hypertrophy (Ref. 36Friddle C.J. Koga T. Rubin E.M. Bristow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6745-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, and many others). Together with our previous report (13Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F. Schneider M.D. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), our present extended analyses in mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of the ANP receptor emphasize that the induction of ANP expression in response to ventricular stretch is not only part of the reactivation of the fetal gene program but also has an important endogenous counter-regulatory, growth-moderating function. The observation that two molecules (ANP, NO), which both signal via cGMP, exert different effects on cardiomyocyte growth is striking. It is conceivable that spatial confinement of different guanylyl cyclase receptors (GC-A, soluble GC) within distinct microdomains of cardiomyocytes allows cGMP to locally regulate different effector molecules and, ultimately, to exert different effects on cardiomyocyte growth and contractile functions. For instance, it has been shown that GC-A, but not soluble GC, has potent effects on plasma membrane control of the calcium ATPase pump (37Zolle O. Lawrie A.M. Simpson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25892-25899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that ANP/GC-A, but not NO/soluble GC, stimulates the translocation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase I to the plasma membrane (30Airhart N. Yang Y.-F. Roberts C.T. Silberbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38693-38698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hence, the mechanisms for compartmentation of cGMP-mediated signaling within cardiomyocytes, and in particular the specific immediate downstream targets ultimately mediating the ERK 1/2 and calcineurin-inhibiting, antihypertrophic effects of ANP/GC-A/cGMP, remain intriguing issues. We thank Melanie Voss and Danuta Mitko for excellent experimental assistance."

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PARG on the modulation of the inflammatory response caused by splanchnic ischemia and reperfusion. SAO shock in rats and wild-type (WT) mice was associated with a significant neutrophil infiltration in the ileum and production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Reperfused ileum tissue sections from SAO-shocked WT mice and rats showed positive staining for P-selectin and ICAM-1 localized mainly in the vascular endothelial cells. Genetic disruption of the PARG gene in mice or pharmacological inhibition of PARG by PARG inhibitors significantly improved the histological status of the reperfused tissues associated with reduced expression of P-selectin and ICAM-1, neutrophil infiltration into the reperfused intestine, and TNF-alpha production. These results suggest that PARG activity modulates the inflammatory response in ischemia/reperfusion and participates in end (target) organ damage under these conditions."

Renin, through its participation in an enzymatic cascade that results in the production of angiotensin II, the major effector molecule of the renin-angiotensin system, plays a major role in blood pressure regulation and electrolyte homeostasis. Expression of the renin gene is subject to complex tissue-specific and developmental regulation. Progress has been made recently in understanding the mechanisms of this regulation (1Pan L. Gross K.W.

This cell line was developed from a Ren-2-T antigen transgenic line and has been shown to retain many features characteristic of renin-expressing juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney (5Sigmund C.D.

A HOX·PBX-binding site has been located within the Ren-1c proximal promoter region (6Pan L. Xie Y. Black T.A. Jones C.A. Pruitt S.C. Gross K.W. J. Biol.

Mutation of the site in a construct containing 4.1 kb of the Ren-1c 5′-flanking sequence caused a more than 10-fold decrease in transcriptional activity. HOXD10 is capable of pairing with PBX1b and binding to the Ren-1c HOX·PBX site with high affinity. Moreover, PREP1 has been shown to form a ternary complex with HOXD10 and PBX1b on the Ren-1c promoter. The HOX·PBX-binding site is also present in human and rat renin promoters, suggesting an important role of this site in the regulation of renin expression. Notch is a transmembrane receptor that regulates expression of genes in a cell type-specific fashion to determine cell fate and patterning through cell-cell communication (see Refs. 7Lai E.C. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 8Kopan R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1095-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schweisguth F. Curr.

Upon receipt of extracellular signals mediated via binding of the specific ligands, Jagged and Delta-like, the intracellular domain of Notch is released by proteolytic cleavages and translocates to the nucleus, where it subsequently interacts with the transcriptional repressor CBF1 and converts it to a transcriptional activator through replacement of the CBF1-bound co-repressor complex with a co-activator complex. Several co-repressors have been identified, including CIR, SMART, and N-CoR (10Hsieh J.J. Zhou S. Chen L. Young D.B. Hayward S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2269-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), whereas Mastermind appears to be a major co-activator for Notch signaling (12Petcherski A.G. Kimble J. Nature. 2000; 405: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Wu L. Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Lake R. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Griffin J.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified two new transcription factor-binding sites, a CBF1- and an Ets-binding site, in the promoter region of the rat renin gene in addition to the HOX·PBX-binding site identified previously (6Pan L. Xie Y. Black T.A. Jones C.A. Pruitt S.C. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32489-32494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The CBF1-binding site acts as a negative regulatory element in renin-expressing Calu-6 cells and non-renin-expressing COS-7 cells, whereas the Ets-binding site is a positive regulatory element in all cell lines tested. Moreover, we showed that N1IC 1The abbreviations used are: N1IC, intracellular domain of Notch1; N3IC, intracellular domain of Notch3; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus. 1The abbreviations used are: N1IC, intracellular domain of Notch1; N3IC, intracellular domain of Notch3; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus. and Ets-1 activated the rat renin promoter through the CBF1- and Ets-binding sites, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that N1IC, Ets-1, and HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1 were capable of cooperating with each other to activate the rat renin promoter. Plasmids—Plasmid rR240 was constructed by inserting a fragment containing the rat renin gene region from -241 to +16, which was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from a bacterial artificial chromosome, CH230 101 J7, containing the rat renin genomic sequence, into the XhoI/HindIII-digested pGL2-basic (Promega). Plasmids containing mutations in the transcription factor-binding sites of the rat renin promoter (see Fig. 3) were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides used to generate mutations in the CBF1-, Ets-, and HOX·PBX-binding site are 5′-CTGGGTTCAGCCATGTTTaaagCACTCGATTCCTGCCACTC-3′, 5′-CCTGCCACTCTGCTTCGCTTaaGGCTCCTGCTTATCCCTC-3′, and 5′-GGACCCTGGGGTAAccAActAGAGCAGGGCCTG-3′, respectively. Plasmid 7XrCBF1-SV40 or 5XmrCBF1-SV40 was constructed by inserting seven tandem copies of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the rat renin CBF1-binding site (5′-tcgagGCCATGTTTCCCACACTCGATTc-3′) or five tandem copies of an oligonucleotide containing the mutated CBF1-binding site (5′-tcgagGCCATGTTTaaagCACTCGATTc-3′), respectively, into the XhoI site of pGL2-Promoter (Promega). The expression vectors for Ets-1, Ets-2, and CBF1 contain the I.M.A.G.E. full-length cDNA clones inserted in pCMV·SPORT6 and were purchased from Open Biosystems. The mouse N1IC expression plasmid contains the intracellular domain of Notch1 under the control of a CMV promoter and was kindly provided by Dr. R. Kopan (Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO) (14Kopan R. Nye J.S. Weintraub H. Development. 1994; 120: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VP16-CBF1 was constructed by inserting the polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA encoding CBF1 into the EcoRI/XbaI-digested pVP16 (BD Biosciences). The expression vectors for HOXD10, PBX1b, and PREP1 contain the mouse full-length cDNAs inserted in pcDNA3.1/myc-His(+)A and were described previously (6Pan L. Xie Y. Black T.A. Jones C.A.

Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—As4.1 and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Calu-6 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with non-essential amino acids and 10% fetal bovine serum. All three of these cell lines were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). For each transfection in a 35-mm culture dish, ∼2 μg of DNA (see figure legends for the amount of each plasmid added in a transfection assay) were mixed with 6 μl of Lipofectamine. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were harvested and measured for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and Galacto-Light Plus chemiluminescent reporter assay (Tropix), respectively. Luciferase activity is normalized with β-galactosidase activity to correct for differences in transfection efficiency between experiments. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments. EMSA—The EMSA was performed as described previously (3Pan L. Black T.A. Shi Q. Jones C.A. Petrovic N. Loudon J. Kane C. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45530-45538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The CBF1 antiserum (K-0043) (15Hamaguchi Y. Yamamoto Y. Iwanari H. Maruyama S. Furukawa T. Matsunami N. Honjo T. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) used in supershift assay was purchased from the Institute of Immunology, Tokyo, Japan. Identification of a CBF1-binding Site in the Rat Renin Promoter—A phylogenetic footprinting comparison of human, rat, and mouse renin promoter sequences identifies a highly conserved sequence consisting of a TTCCCACA motif (Fig. 1A). Further analysis using the transcription factor database Mat-Inspector suggests that it is a putative binding site for the transcriptional repressor, CBF1. Results from EMSA showed that a double-stranded oligonucleotide, rRen, which represents the rat promoter sequence from -185 to -166 bp containing putative CBF1-binding site, formed a complex with nuclear proteins prepared from As4.1 cells (Fig. 1B). This complex could be efficiently competed by 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled rRen itself, mRen, a corresponding mouse renin promoter sequence, and oligonucleotides containing previously identified CBF1-binding sites, including 23/24, HES-1, NF-kB, and IL-6kB, whereas it could not be competed by oligonucleotides that do not contain the CBF1-binding site such as IL-2kB and IgkB (Fig. 1, A and B) (16Palmieri M. Sasso M.P. Monese R. Merola M. Faggioli L. Tovey M. Furia A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2785-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a CBF1-specific antibody supershifted the DNA·protein complex. These results demonstrate that the rat promoter sequence from -175 to -168 is a CBF1-binding site. To test in vivo whether the rat renin CBF1-binding site functions as a binding site for CBF1 and target for activation by the Notch signaling pathway, a construct containing seven tandem copies of the rat renin CBF1-binding site inserted immediately upstream an SV40 promoter (7XrCBF1-SV40) was cotransfected into COS-7 cells with an expression vector for CBF1, VP16-CBF1, or N1IC. Results showed that overexpression of CBF1 did not have a significant effect on promoter activity, whereas VP16-CBF1 or N1IC activated the promoter by >20- or >200-fold, respectively (Fig. 1C). Moreover, neither VP16-CBF1 nor N1IC has any stimulatory effect on activity of the promoter containing five tandem copies of the mutated rat renin CBF1-binding site (5XmrCBF1-SV40). These results indicate that the rat renin CBF1-binding site is capable of binding the CBF1·N1IC complex in vivo. Results from transfection analysis also showed that N1IC-induced promoter activity of construct 7XrCBF1-SV40 was reduced by overexpression of CBF1, consistent with previous reports (17Oswald F. Liptay S. Adler G. Schmid R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chen H. Chong Y. Liu C.-L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1675-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Identification of an Ets-binding Site within the Rat Renin Promoter—An Ets-binding site has been identified in the human renin promoter, which resides immediately 3′ to the TATA box (19Borensztein P. Germain S. Fuchs S. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, no Ets-binding site is identifiable at the same position in the rat renin promoter. The rat renin promoter sequence does, however, contain several GGA(A/T) (or inverting (T/A)TCC) motifs, which are the consensus binding sequences for the Ets family transcription factors. Oligonucleotide (rR150), which contains a putative Ets-binding site located between -143 and -138 bp of the rat renin promoter, was found to bind nuclear proteins prepared from As4.1 cells (Fig. 2). Competition EMSA using a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides containing truncations and mutations within rR150 confirmed that the critical base pairs for nuclear protein binding include TTCC. Moreover, the DNA·protein complexes in EMSA are efficiently competed by an oligonucleotide (Fig. 2, conEts) containing the consensus Ets-binding site. These results demonstrate that the rat renin promoter contains an Ets-binding site located between -143 and -138 bp. Effect of Mutation in the CBF1-, Ets-, or HOX·PBX-binding Site on Promoter Activity of the Rat Renin Gene—To test whether mutation of the CBF1-, Ets-, or HOX·PBX-binding site affects activity of the rat renin promoter, constructs containing single, double, or triple mutations in these sites (Fig. 3) were transfected into Calu-6, As4.1, or COS-7 cells. Calu-6 cells were developed from a human pulmonary carcinoma and express their endogenous renin gene (20Lang J.A. Yang G. Kern J.A. Sigmund C.D. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 704-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas COS-7 cells do not express their endogenous renin gene but have been widely used to study the Notch signaling pathway. Consistent with this, a 60-fold higher basal expression from the rat renin promoter was observed in Calu-6 cells than in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4). Moreover, mutation of the CBF1-binding site resulted in a significant increase in promoter activity in both Calu-6 and COS-7 cells, indicating that CBF1 binds to the rat renin promoter and acts as a transcriptional repressor. However, mutation of the CBF1-binding site had no effect on promoter activity in As4.1 cells, suggesting that one or more co-repressors necessary for CBF1-mediated repression may be absent in As4.1 cells. Alternatively, the Notch pathway may be constitutively active in these cells. Mutation of the Ets-binding site reduced promoter activity by 63, 33, and 78% in Calu-6, As4.1, and COS-7 cells, respectively, demonstrating an important role for Ets family transcription factors in regulating rat renin gene expression. Our results also show that mutation of the HOX·PBX-binding site alone did not significantly alter transcriptional activity of the rat renin promoter in these three cell lines. Only when the HOX·PBX-binding site is mutated in a construct that already contains mutations in the CBF1- and Ets-binding sites was a significant decrease in promoter activity observed in As4.1 cells (compare promoter activity of rR240/mEC with that of rR240/mPHEC). Another interesting finding was that mutation of the CBF1-binding site did not significantly increase transcriptional activity of the rat renin promoter lacking the Ets-binding site in any of the three cell lines (compare promoter activity of rR240/mEts with that of rR240/mEC), suggesting that the repressor function of CBF1 may be dependent on the presence of the Ets-binding site. Activation of the Rat Renin Promoter by HOX D10·PBX1b· PREP1, Ets-1, and N1IC in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the reporter construct rR240 and expression vectors for N1IC, Ets-1, and/or Ets-2 to determine whether these transcription factors are capable of activating the rat renin promoter individually or in combination. As shown in Fig. 5A, either N1IC or Ets-1 by itself activated the promoter by 2-fold, whereas overexpression of Ets-2 did not have any effect. The Ets-2-expressing vector used in this study could activate an Ets-responsive human chorionic gonadotropin subunit α-promoter-luciferase reporter (38Ghosh D. Sachdev S. Hannink M. Roberts R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1049-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in COS-7 cells (data not shown), indicating that active Ets-2 protein is generated from the vector. N1IC was capable of further increasing the Ets-1-mediated transactivation to 6-fold, indicating that N1IC and Ets-1 activate the rat renin promoter cooperatively. Ets-2, however, was incapable of collaborating with N1IC (data not shown). When COS-7 cells were transfected with the reporter construct rR240/mCBF1, which contains a mutation in the CBF1-binding site, induction by N1IC on basal promoter activity was reduced to 1.4-fold. Moreover, N1IC had no effect on the Ets-1-mediated activation. These results suggest that the CBF1-binding site is important for the function of N1IC. Finally, when the renin promoter construct containing the mutation in the Ets-binding site (rR240/mEts) was tested, no induction of promoter activity by either N1IC or Ets-1, or both, was observed, showing that the Ets-binding site is necessary not only for the effect of Ets-1 on the rat renin promoter but for the effect of N1IC as well. We next examined whether HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1, which has been shown to bind to the HOX·PBX-binding site in the mouse, rat, or human renin promoter (Ref. 6Pan L. Xie Y. Black T.A. Jones C.A. Pruitt S.C. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32489-32494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and data not shown), is capable of activating the rat renin promoter alone or in cooperation with N1IC in COS-7 cells. Results from transfection assays showed that HOXD10 alone activated the rat renin promoter in construct rR240 by 2.3-fold, whereas either PBX1b or PREP1 alone had no effect (Fig. 5B). Moreover, cotransfection of both PBX1b and PREP1 caused a 2-fold increase in rat renin promoter activity. HOXD10 further enhances the induction by PBX1b and PREP1 to 5.3-fold. The HOX·PBX-binding site is important for the activation of the rat renin promoter by HOXD10, PBX1b, and PREP1 since mutation of the site resulted in a 2.7-fold decrease in the activation by these homeodomain proteins. However, mutation of the HOX·PBX binding site did not completely abolish the induction by HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1, suggesting that there may be one or more cis-elements present in the rat renin promoter mediating their effect. Our results also showed a cooperative activation of the rat renin promoter by N1IC and HOXD10·PBX1b· PREP1. The addition of N1IC caused a 3.8-fold further enhancement of the induction by HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1 of promoter activity of the rat renin gene. The enhancement by N1IC of the HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1 induction was reduced to 1.7- or 2.5-fold when the CBF1- or HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1-binding site, respectively, was mutated. When COS-7 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for Ets-1, HOXD10, PBX1b, and PREP1 altogether with rRen240, a 14.4-fold induction over basal promoter activity of the rat renin gene was observed (Fig. 5C). N1IC further enhanced this induction to 31.4-fold. Interestingly, N1IC decreased Ets-1·HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1-mediated induction by 2-fold in COS-7 cells transfected with the rat renin promoter containing the mutated CBF1-binding site. Although Ets-1 alone had no effect on activity of the rat renin promoter containing the mutated Ets-1-binding site, it is capable of further increasing the HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1-mediated activation of the same promoter. It is possible that Ets-1 may directly or indirectly interact with the HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1 complex. Moreover, overexpression of N1IC did not alter the effect of Ets-1·HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1 on activity of this mutant promoter, demonstrating again that not only is the activation of the rat renin promoter by N1IC dependent on the presence of the CBF1-binding site but on the Ets-1-binding site as well. On the contrary, mutation of the HOX·PBX-binding site did not change the effect of N1IC. A 2-fold induction by N1IC over the Ets-1·HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1-mediated activation of the promoter was still observed. Finally, when the construct rRen240/mPHEC, in which the HOX·PBX-, Ets-1-, and CBF1-binding sites are all mutated, was tested in COS-7 cells, no significant effect from N1IC, Ets-1, or HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1 by themselves on promoter activity was detected. When compared with the 31.4-fold activation of the wild-type rat renin promoter, only a 2-fold activation of this promoter was observed in COS-7 cells simultaneously expressing Ets-1, HOXD10, PBX1b, PREP1, and N1IC, suggesting critical roles for these three cis-regulatory sites in regulating renin gene expression. In this study, a CBF1- and an Ets-binding site were identified in the promoter region of the rat renin gene. Transcription factor Ets-1 binds to the Ets-binding site and activates the rat renin promoter, whereas CBF1 acts as a transcriptional repressor in renin-expressing Calu-6 and non-renin-expressing COS-7 cells. Moreover, N1IC is capable of counteracting the negative effect of CBF1 and activating the rat renin promoter via the CBF1-binding site in cooperation with Ets-1 and HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1. The Ets transcription factors are implicated in cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and cell-cell interactions (21Maroulakou I.G. Bowe D.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6432-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). An Ets-binding site has also been identified in the human renin promoter (19Borensztein P. Germain S. Fuchs S. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is located immediately 3′ to the TATA box and capable of binding Ets-1 (22Konoshita T. Germain S. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1515-1524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23Konoshita T. Makino Y. Wakahara S. Ido K. Yoshida M. Kawai Y. Miyamori I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, whether it contributes to promoter activity of the human renin gene has not been determined. Ets-1 has been reported to play a role in vascular development and angiogenesis (24Sato Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Mice deficient for Ets-1 have severe kidney abnormalities and/or lethal angiogenic defects (25Gomez R.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1643PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that renin-expressing cells are associated with the branching of renal arterioles (26Reddi V. Zaglul A. Pentz E.S. Gomez R.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 63-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Jones C.A. Hurley M.I. Black T.A. Kane C.M. Pan L. Pruitt S.C. Gross K.W. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), Ets-1 may be one of transcription factors critical for renin gene expression. Whether any of the Ets consensus sequences present in the mouse renin promoter is a functional Ets-binding site remains to be investigated. The Notch signaling pathway also plays an important role in forming the vasculature (28Shawber C.J. Kitajewski J. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in genes encoding Notch, Notch ligands, and components of the Notch signaling pathway all show vascular defects. Notch and Notch ligands are expressed throughout the vasculature early in embryonic development but restricted to arterial vessels later. This is consistent with the notion that renin expression is only detected in developing arteries in the mouse or rat fetal kidney (29Jones C.A. Sigmund C.D. McGowan R.A. Kane-Haas C.M. Gross K.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Gomez R.A. Lynch K.R. Sturgill B.C. Elwood J.P. Chevalier R.L. Carey R.M. Peach M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F850-F858PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of the renin gene as the downstream target of the Notch signaling pathway provides us with some clues in understanding the tissue-specific regulation of renin gene expression. We have previously hypothesized that the binding of transcriptional repressors to the renin promoter may be the reason that renin transcription is turned off in non-renin-expressing cells (2Petrovic N. Black T.A. Fabian J.R. Kane C. Jones C.A. Loudon J.A. Abonia J.P. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here, we show that CBF1 is one of those hypothesized repressors. Upon activation of notch signaling, the direct interaction of NIC with CBF1 turns CBF1 from a repressor to an activator. However, the renin gene is not expressed in every cell in which Notch signaling is activated, suggesting that Notch is necessary but not sufficient for renin gene expression. Cooperation between CBF1·Notch and other transcription factors such as Ets-1 and HOX D10· PBX1b·PREP1 may be necessary for renin expression. This fits a model proposed by Furriols and Bray (31Furriols M. Bray S. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 60-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) for Notch target gene regulation. They suggest that in the absence of Notch, DNA-bound CBF1 prevents transcriptional activators from enhancing transcription. Notch activation can alleviate the repression so that CBF1 is capable of cooperating with other DNA-bound activators to promote transcription. We observed that N1IC had reduced but still significant stimulatory effect on the promoter activity of the rat renin gene even when the CBF1-binding site is mutated. However, when the Ets-binding site is mutated, no significant effect by N1IC is observed. It is possible that N1IC directly or indirectly interacts with DNA-bound Ets-1 to promote this increase. Interactions of N1IC with transcription factors other than CBF1 have been reported. For example, N1IC is capable of inhibiting NF-κB activity in the nucleus by a direct interaction (32Wang J. Shelly L. Miele L. Boykins R. Norcross M.A. Guan E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, N1IC can act as a co-activator for transcription factor LEF-1 (33Ross D.A. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7537-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We showed that the wild-type rat renin promoter or the promoter containing triple mutations in the HOX·PBX-, Ets-, and CBF1-binding site exhibits considerably stronger activity in renin-expressing Calu-6 than in COS-7 cells (Fig. 4). This suggests that there are still unidentified cell-specific transcription factors binding at the rat renin promoter important for expression and that the Calu-6 cell line can be used as a model system to identify these transcription factors. These unidentified transcription factors may also cooperate with Notch to promote renin transcription. A number of transcription factor-binding sites have been identified in the human renin promoter using primary cultures of renin-expressing human chorionic cells (19Borensztein P. Germain S. Fuchs S. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition to the HOX·PBX- and Ets-binding site, a cAMP-responsive element, a chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII)-binding site, and two unidentified transcription factor-binding sites are present in the human promoter. These cis-regulatory sites could also be present in the rat renin promoter considering that strong sequence conservation is found in this region upon aligning these two promoters (1Pan L. Gross K.W. Hypertension. 2005; 45: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The rat renin promoter with the mutation in the CBF1-binding site did not show any increased activity when compared with the wild-type promoter when assayed in As4.1 cells. This result suggests that the repressive function of CBF1 is lost in As4.1 cells. However, results from EMSA show that CBF1 is expressed in As4.1 cells (Fig. 1B). It is possible that one or more co-repressors are absent or that the Notch pathway is constitutively active in this cell line. Since As4.1 cells were selected from tumors initiated by transgene-targeted oncogenesis with a mouse renin promoter driving SV40 T antigen, the renin gene promoter is probably maximally stimulated, and any negative regulation of the renin promoter may be lost or diminished in these cells. We showed previously that high level expression of Ren-1c in As4.1 cells is partly due to a constitutively active cAMP-dependent protein kinase (3Pan L. Black T.A. Shi Q. Jones C.A. Petrovic N. Loudon J. Kane C. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45530-45538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the intracellular domain of Notch3 (N3IC), in contrast to N1IC, is a poor activator and is capable of acting as a repressor by blocking the N1IC-activated gene expression (34Beatus P. Lundkvist J. Oberg C. Lendahl U. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have found that N3IC can also cooperate with Ets-1 or HOXD10·PBX1b·PREP1 to activate the rat renin promoter, although the effect by N3IC is smaller than that of N1IC (data not shown). Moreover, an additive effect was obtained when both N1IC and N3IC were cotransfected with the promoter-reporter construct in the presence or absence of other expression vectors (data not shown). These results suggest that members of the Notch family may have redundant roles in regulating renin gene expression. We are currently studying the renin expression pattern in mice deficient for Notch3 expression (35Krebs L.T. Xue Y. Norton C.R. Sundberg J.P. Beatus P. Lendahl U. Joutel A. Gridley T. Genesis. 2003; 37: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which have been shown to have defects in arterial differentiation and maturation of vascular smooth muscle cells (36Domenga V. Fardoux P. Lacombe P. Monet M. Maciazek J. Krebs L.T. Klonjkowski B. Berrou E. Mericskay M. Li Z. Tournier-Lasserve E. Gridley T. Joutel A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2730-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), to further understand the mechanisms of regulation of renin gene expression by Notch. A screen of the Drosophila X chromosome for genes whose dosage affects the function of the HOX gene Deformed revealed that Notch is one of these genes (37Florence B. McGinnis W. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1497-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notch also affects the function of another HOX gene, Ultrabithorax. These results suggest that Notch may be generally involved in homeotic function. Here, we show that Notch signaling and HOX·PBX· PREP complex functionally interact with each other to activate renin gene expression. The finding suggests a role for renin in the development of renal vasculature. We thank Dr. R. Kopan for providing the mouse N1IC expression vector. We also thank Colleen Kane for cell culture preparation. This research utilized core facilities supported in part by Roswell Park Cancer Institute's National Cancer Institute-funded Cancer Center support Grant CA-16056."
https://openalex.org/W2067885841,"We investigated expression regulation of the human atrial myosin light chain 1 (hALC-1) gene using a cardiomyocyte H9c2 cell line stably transfected with a construct consisting of the human ALC-1 promoter cloned in front of the luciferase gene (H9c2T1). H9c2T1 cells were stimulated with vasopressin, which is known to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and to activate a panel of signaling pathways. Those pathways involved in hALC-1 promoter activity regulation were dissected by using pharmacological inhibitor substances. Stimulation with vasopressin was associated with nuclear NFAT translocation and significantly increased human ALC-1 promoter activity. Inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin A blocked the effects of vasopressin on ALC-1 promoter activity to approximately 50%. This suggests that the Ca2+-calmodulin-calcineurin-NFAT pathway is involved in human ALC-1 promoter activation. However, inhibition of multifunctional Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK) by KN-93 decreased human ALC-1 promoter activity to almost basal levels. CaMK regulation of ALC-1 promoter activity effect could well be mediated by CaMKIV, which accumulated in the nucleus upon vasopressin stimulation. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms by bisindolylmaleimide had no significant influence on human ALC-1 promoter activity. Thus, our results demonstrate a dominant role of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent signaling pathways in the regulation of human ALC-1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2150676681,"Replicative senescence is thought to relate to aging in vivo and tumor suppression. In this report, we isolated a gene and designated it as RDL (replicative senescence down-regulated Leo1-like gene). RDL's expression decreased upon replicative senescence of human diploid 2BS fibroblasts. Overexpression of RDL slightly delayed 2BS fibroblast senescence, whereas suppression of RDL expression imposed no obvious effects on senescence. However, introduction of cDNA fragment encoding the Leo1-like domain of RDLp (Leo) alone shortened the replicative life span of 2BS fibroblasts and promoted several senescent features; the introduction of truncated RDL cDNA fragment resulting from deletion of Leo (RDL-Leo-) significantly prolonged 2BS life span and caused a noticeable delay of these senescent features. We demonstrated that introduction of Leo obviously increased the expression of p16INK4a, p21WAF1, and PTEN, whereas introduction of RDL-Leo- distinctly decreased p16INK4a expression. Taken together, our results suggest that the Leo1-like domain of RDLp is a senescence-associated domain that accelerates the senescence of 2BS fibroblasts and that there should be another counteractive domain in the remaining part of RDLp."
