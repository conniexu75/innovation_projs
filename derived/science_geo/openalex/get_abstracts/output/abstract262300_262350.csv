https://openalex.org/W2133938268,"We describe the results of a genome-wide analysis of human cells that suggests that most protein-coding genes, including most genes thought to be transcriptionally inactive, experience transcription initiation. We found that nucleosomes with H3K4me3 and H3K9,14Ac modifications, together with RNA polymerase II, occupy the promoters of most protein-coding genes in human embryonic stem cells. Only a subset of these genes produce detectable full-length transcripts and are occupied by nucleosomes with H3K36me3 modifications, a hallmark of elongation. The other genes experience transcription initiation but show no evidence of elongation, suggesting that they are predominantly regulated at postinitiation steps. Genes encoding most developmental regulators fall into this group. Our results also identify a class of genes that are excluded from experiencing transcription initiation, at which mechanisms that prevent initiation must predominate. These observations extend to differentiated cells, suggesting that transcription initiation at most genes is a general phenomenon in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1966227354,"Autophagy involves de novo formation of double membrane-bound structures called autophagosomes, which engulf material to be degraded in lytic compartments. Atg8 is a ubiquitin-like protein required for this process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that can be conjugated to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine by a ubiquitin-like system. Here, we show using an in vitro system that Atg8 mediates the tethering and hemifusion of membranes, which are evoked by the lipidation of the protein and reversibly modulated by the deconjugation enzyme Atg4. Mutational analyses suggest that membrane tethering and hemifusion observed in vitro represent an authentic function of Atg8 in autophagosome formation in vivo. In addition, electron microscopic analyses indicate that these functions of Atg8 are involved in the expansion of autophagosomal membranes. Our results provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying the unique membrane dynamics of autophagy and also indicate the functional versatility of ubiquitin-like proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2143368326,"The reproducibility and precision of biological patterning is limited by the accuracy with which concentration profiles of morphogen molecules can be established and read out by their targets. We consider four measures of precision for the Bicoid morphogen in the Drosophila embryo: the concentration differences that distinguish neighboring cells, the limits set by the random arrival of Bicoid molecules at their targets (which depends on absolute concentration), the noise in readout of Bicoid by the activation of Hunchback, and the reproducibility of Bicoid concentration at corresponding positions in multiple embryos. We show, through a combination of different experiments, that all of these quantities are ∼10%. This agreement among different measures of accuracy indicates that the embryo is not faced with noisy input signals and readout mechanisms; rather, the system exerts precise control over absolute concentrations and responds reliably to small concentration differences, approaching the limits set by basic physical principles. The reproducibility and precision of biological patterning is limited by the accuracy with which concentration profiles of morphogen molecules can be established and read out by their targets.

This agreement among different measures of accuracy indicates that the embryo is not faced with noisy input signals and readout mechanisms; rather, the system exerts precise control over absolute concentrations and responds reliably to small concentration differences, approaching the limits set by basic physical principles. The macroscopic structural patterns of multicellular organisms have their origins in spatial patterns of morphogen molecules (Wolpert, 1969Wolpert L. Positional information and the spatial pattern of cellular differentiation.J. Theor. Biol. 1969; 25: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar, Lawrence, 1992Lawrence P.A. The Making of a Fly: The Genetics of Animal Design. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford1992Google Scholar). Translating this qualitative picture into quantitative terms raises several difficulties. First is the problem of precision (Figure 1): Neighboring cells often adopt distinct fates, but the signals that drive these decisions involve very small differences in morphogen concentration, and these must be discriminated against the inevitable background of random noise. The second problem is reproducibility: If cells “know” their location based on the concentration of particular morphogens, then generating reproducible final patterns requires either that the absolute concentrations of these molecules be reproducible from embryo to embryo or that there exist mechanisms which achieve a robust output despite variable input signals. These problems of precision and reproducibility are potentially relevant to all biochemical and genetic networks, and analogous problems of noise (de Vries, 1956de Vries H.

Here we address these issues in the context of the initial events in fruit fly development. The primary determinant of patterning along the anterior-posterior axis in the fly Drosophila melanogaster is the gradient of Bicoid (Bcd), which is established by maternal placement of bcd mRNA at the anterior end of the embryo (Driever and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1988aDriever W.

Targeting gene expression to the head: the Drosophila orthodenticle gene is a direct target of the Bicoid morphogen.Development. 1998; 125: 4185-4193PubMed Google Scholar). This cascade of events generates a spatial pattern so precise that neighboring nuclei have readily distinguishable levels of expression for several genes (as reviewed by Gergen et al., 1986Gergen J.P. Coulter D. Wieschaus E.F. Segmental pattern and blastoderm cell identities.in: Gall J.G. Gametogenesis and The Early Embryo. Liss Inc., New York1986: 195-220Google Scholar), and these patterns are reproducible from embryo to embryo (Crauk and Dostatni, 2005Crauk O. Dostatni N.

Dyn. 2006; 235: 2949-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In trying to quantify the precision and reproducibility of the initial events in morphogenesis, we can ask four conceptually distinct questions:•If cells make decisions based on the concentration of Bcd alone, how accurately must they “measure” this concentration to be sure that neighboring cells reach reliably distinguishable decisions?•What is the smallest concentration difference that can be measured reliably, given the inevitable noise that results from random arrival of individual Bcd molecules at their target sites along the genome?•What level of precision does the system actually achieve (for example in the transformation from Bcd to Hb)?•How reproducible are the absolute Bcd concentrations at corresponding locations in different embryos? The answer to the first question just depends on the spatial profile of Bicoid concentration (Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002Houchmandzadeh B. Wieschaus E. Leibler S. Establishment of developmental precision and proportions in the early Drosophila embryo.Nature. 2002; 415: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). To answer the second question we need to know the absolute concentration of Bcd in nuclei, and we measure this using the Bcd-GFP fusion constructs described in a companion paper (Gregor et al., 2007Gregor T. Wieschaus E.F. McGregor A.P. Bialek W. Tank D.W. Stability and nuclear dynamics of the Bicoid morphogen gradient.Cell. 2007; 130 (this issue): 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar [this issue of Cell]). To answer the third question we characterize directly the input/output relation between Bcd and Hb protein levels in each nucleus of individual embryos. Finally, to answer the fourth question we make absolute concentration measurements on many embryos, as well as using more classical antibody staining methods. In the end, we find that all of these questions have the same answer: ∼10% accuracy in the Bcd concentration. While this number is interesting, it is the agreement among the four different notions of precision that we find most striking. A number of previous groups have argued that the central problem in thinking quantitatively about the early events in development is to understand how an organism makes precise patterns given sloppy initial data and noisy readout mechanisms (von Dassow et al., 2000von Dassow G.

Analysis of pattern precision shows that Drosophila segmentation develops substantial independence from gradients of maternal gene products.Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 2949-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results lead us to the problem of understanding how extreme precision and reproducibility—down to the limits set by basic physical principles—are achieved in the very first steps of pattern formation. Two to three hours after fertilization of the egg, adjacent cells have adopted distinct fates, as reflected in their patterns of gene expression. At this stage, the embryo is ∼500 μm long, and neighboring nuclei are separated by Δx ∼ 8μm. Distinct fates in neighboring cells therefore means that they acquire positional information with an accuracy of ∼1%–2% along the anterior-posterior axis. Measurements of Bcd concentration by immunostaining reveal an approximately exponential decay along this axis, c(x)=c0exp(−x/λ), with a length constant λ ∼ 100 μm (Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002Houchmandzadeh B. Wieschaus E. Leibler S. Establishment of developmental precision and proportions in the early Drosophila embryo.Nature. 2002; 415: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Neighboring nuclei, at locations x and x+Δx, thus experience Bcd concentrations which differ by a fractionΔc(x)c(x)=1c(x)|dc(x)dx|Δx=Δxλ∼0.1.(1) To distinguish individual nuclei from their neighbors reliably using the Bcd morphogen alone therefore would require each nucleus to “measure” the Bcd concentration with an accuracy of ∼10%. The difficulty of achieving precise and reproducibly functioning biochemical networks is determined in part by the absolute concentration of the relevant molecules: for sufficiently small concentrations, the randomness of individual molecular events must set a limit to precision (Berg and Purcell, 1977Berg H.C.

Since Bcd is a transcription factor, what matters is the concentration in the nuclei of the forming cells. A variety of experiments on Bcd (Ma et al., 1996Ma X. Yuan D. Diepold K. Scarborough T.

In Figure 2A we show an optical section through a live Drosophila embryo that expresses a fully functional fusion of the Bcd protein with the green fluorescent protein, GFP (Gregor et al., 2007Gregor T. Wieschaus E.F. McGregor A.P. Bialek W. Tank D.W. Stability and nuclear dynamics of the Bicoid morphogen gradient.Cell. 2007; 130 (this issue): 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) of the native Bcd. In scanning two-photon microscope images we identify individual nuclei to measure the mean fluorescence intensity in each nucleus, which should be proportional to the protein concentration. To establish the constant of proportionality we bathe the embryo in a solution of purified GFP with known concentration and thus compare fluorescence levels of the same moiety under the same optical conditions (see Experimental Procedures). Some of the observed fluorescence is contributed by molecules other than the Bcd-GFP, and we estimate this background by imaging wild-type embryos under exactly the same conditions. As shown in Figure 2B, this background is almost spatially constant and essentially equal to the level seen in the Bcd-GFP flies at the posterior pole, consistent with the idea that the Bcd concentration is nearly zero at this point. Figure 2B shows the concentration of Bcd-GFP in nuclei as a function of their position along the anterior-posterior axis. The maximal concentration near the anterior pole, corrected for background, is cmax = 55 ± 3 nM, while the concentration in nuclei near the midpoint of the embryo, near the threshold for activation of hb expression (at a position x/L ∼ 48% from the anterior pole), is c = 8 ± 1 nM. This is close to the disassociation constants measured in vitro for binding of Bcd to its target sequences in the hb enhancer (Ma et al., 1996Ma X. Yuan D. Diepold K. Scarborough T. Ma J. The Drosophila morphogenetic protein Bicoid binds DNA cooperatively.Development. 1996; 122: 1195-1206PubMed Google Scholar, Burz et al., 1998Burz D.S. Pivera-Pomar R. Jackle H. Hanes S.D.

The activity of the Drosophila morphogenetic protein Bicoid is inhibited by a domain located outside its homeodomain.Development. 2002; 129: 1669-1680PubMed Google Scholar). Our interest in the precision of the readout mechanism for the Bcd gradient is heightened by the theoretical difficulty of achieving precision on the ∼10% level. To begin, note that 1 nM corresponds to 0.6molecules/μm3, so that the concentration of Bcd in nuclei near the midpoint of the embryo is c = 4.8 ± 0.6 molecules/μm3 or 690 total molecules in the nucleus during nuclear cycle 14. A 10% difference in concentration thus amounts to changes of ∼70 molecules. Berg and Purcell, 1977Berg H.C. Purcell E.M. Physics of chemoreception.Biophys. J. 1977; 20: 193-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar emphasized, in the context of bacterial chemotaxis, that the physical limit to concentration measurements is set not by the total number of available molecules but by the dynamics of their random arrival at their target locations. Consider a receptor of linear size a and assume that the receptor occupancy is integrated for a time T. Berg and Purcell argued that the precision of concentration measurements is limited toδcc∼1DacT,(2) where c is the concentration of the molecule to which the system is responding and D is its diffusion constant in the solution surrounding the receptor. Recent work shows that the Berg-Purcell result really is a lower limit to the noise level (Bialek and Setayeshgar, 2005Bialek W. Setayeshgar S. Physical limits to biochemical signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 10040-10045Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, Bialek and Setayeshgar, 2006Bialek, W., and Setayeshgar, S. (2006). Cooperativity, sensitivity and noise in biochemical signaling. http://arXiv.org/q-bio.MN/0601001.Google Scholar): the complexities of the kinetics describing the interaction of the receptor with the signaling molecule just add extra noise but cannot reduce the effective noise level below that in Equation 2. These theoretical results encourage us to apply this formula to understand the sensitivity of cells not just to external chemical signals (as in chemotaxis) but also to internal signals, including morphogens such as Bcd. Here we estimate the parameters that set the limiting accuracy in Equation 2; for details see Supplemental Data. The total concentration of Bcd in nuclei is c = 4.8 ± 0.6 molecules/μm3 near the point where the “decision” is made to activate Hb (Figure 2B). Bicoid diffuses slowly through the dense cytoplasm surrounding the nuclei with a diffusion constant D<1μm2/s (Gregor et al., 2007Gregor T. Wieschaus E.F. McGregor A.P. Bialek W. Tank D.W. Stability and nuclear dynamics of the Bicoid morphogen gradient.Cell. 2007; 130 (this issue): 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), which is similar to that observed in bacterial cells (Elowitz et al., 1999Elowitz M.B. Surette M.G. Wolf P.E. Stock J.B. Leibler S. Protein mobility in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 197-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we take this as a reasonable estimate of the effective diffusion constant for Bcd in the nucleus. Receptor sites for eukaryotic transcription factors are ∼10 base pair segments of DNA with linear dimensions α ∼ 3 nm. The remaining parameter, which is unknown, is the amount of time T over which the system averages in determining the response to the Bcd gradient; the longer the averaging time, the lower the noise level. Putting together the parameters above, we haveδcc∼[DacT]−1/2=[(1μm2/s)(3nm)(4.8/μm3)T]−1/2∼(70sT)1/2.(3) Thus to achieve precision on the ∼10% level (i.e., δc/c ∼ 0.1) requires T ∼ 7000 s or nearly two hours. This is almost the entire time available for development from fertilization up to cellularization, and it seems implausible that downstream gene expression levels reflect an average of local Bcd concentrations over this long time, especially given the enormous changes in local Bcd concentration during the course of each nuclear cycle (Gregor et al., 2007Gregor T. Wieschaus E.F. McGregor A.P. Bialek W. Tank D.W. Stability and nuclear dynamics of the Bicoid morphogen gradient.Cell. 2007; 130 (this issue): 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Our discussion ignores all noise sources other than the fundamental physical process of random molecular arrivals at the relevant binding sites; additional noise sources would necessitate even longer averaging times. Although there are uncertainties, the minimum time required to push the physical limits down to the ∼10% level seems inconsistent with the pace of developmental events. The fact that neighboring cells can generate distinct patterns of gene expression does not mean that any single step in the readout of the primary morphogen gradients achieves this level of precision. Here we measure more directly the precision of the transformation from Bcd to Hb, one of the first steps in the generation of anterior-posterior pattern. In Figure 3A we show confocal microscope images of a Drosophila embryo fixed during nuclear cycle 14 and immunostained for DNA, Bcd, and Hb; the fluorescence peaks of the different labels are sufficiently distinct that we can obtain independent images of the three stains. The DNA images allow us to locate automatically the centers and outlines of the ∼1200 nuclei in a single image of one embryo (see Experimental Procedures). Given these outlines we can measure the average intensity of Bcd and Hb staining in each nucleus (Figure 3B). We have shown in a companion paper (Gregor et al., 2007Gregor T. Wieschaus E.F. McGregor A.P. Bialek W. Tank D.W. Stability and nuclear dynamics of the Bicoid morphogen gradient.Cell. 2007; 130 (this issue): 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) that immunofluorescent staining intensity I is proportional to protein concentration c plus some nonspecific background, I=Ac+B, where A and B are constant in a single image. With this linearity, a single image provides more than 1000 points on the scatter plot of Hb expression level versus Bcd concentration, as in Figure 3C. Scatter plots as in Figure 3 contain information both about the mean “input/output” relation between Bcd and Hb and about the precision or reliability of this response. We can think of these data as the generalization to multicellular, eukaryotic systems of the input/output scatter plots measured for engineered regulatory elements in bacteria (e.g., Figure 3B of Rosenfeld et al., 2005Rosenfeld N. Young J.W. Alon U. Swain P.S. Elowitz M.B. Gene regulation at the single cell level.Science. 2005; 307: 1962-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). To analyze these data we discretize the Bcd axis into bins, grouping together nuclei which have very similar levels of staining for Bcd; within each bin we compute the mean and variance of the Hb intensity. We measure the Hb level in units of its maximal mean response and the Bcd level in units of the level which generates (on average) half-maximal Hb. Input/output relations between Bcd and Hb are shown for nine individual embryos in Figure 4A. Results from different embryos are very similar (see Experimental Procedures for discussion of normalization across embryos), and pooling the results from all embryos yields an input/output relation that fits well to the Hill relation,Hb=HbmaxBcdnBcdn+Bcd1/2n.(4) The best fit is with n=5, consistent with the idea that Hb transcription is activated by cooperative binding of effectively five Bcd molecules, as expected from the identification of seven Bcd-binding sites in the hb promoter (Struhl et al., 1989Struhl G. Struhl K. Macdonald P.M. The gradient morphogen Bicoid is a concentration-dependent transcriptional activator.Cell. 1989; 57: 1259-1273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, Driever and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1989Driever W. Nüsslein-Volhard C. The Bicoid protein is a positive regulator of hunchback transcription in the early Drosophila embryo.Nature. 1989; 337: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In Figure 4B we show the standard deviation in Hb levels as a function of the Bcd concentration. Output fluctuations are below 10% when the activator Bcd is at high concentration, similar to results on engineered systems (Elowitz et al., 2002Elowitz M.B. Levine A.J. Siggia E.D. Swain P.D. Stochastic gene expression in a single cell.Science. 2002; 207: 1183-1186Crossref Scopus (3546) Google Scholar, Raser and O'Shea, 2004Raser J.M. O'Shea E.K. Control of stochasticity in eukaryotic gene expression.Science. 2004; 304: 1811-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). If we think of the Hb expression level as a readout of the Bcd gradient, then we can convert the output noise in Hb levels into an equivalent level of input noise in the Bcd concentration. This is the same transformation as for the propagation of errors: we ask what level of error δc in Bcd concentration would generate the observed level of variance in Hb expression,σHb2(Bcd)=|d[Hb]d[Bcd]|2(δc)2,(5) orδcc=σHb(Bcd)|d[Hb]dln[Bcd]|−1.(6) It is this equivalent fractional noise level (Figure 4C) that cannot fall below the physical limit set by Equation 2. For individual embryos we find a minimum value of δc/c ∼ 0.1 near c=c1/2. It should be emphasized that all of the noise we observe could in principle result from our measurements. In particular, because the input/output relation is very steep, small errors in measuring the Bcd concentration will lead to a large apparent variance of the Hb output. In separate experiments (see Experimental Procedures) we estimate the component of measurement noise which arises in the imaging process. Subtracting this instrumental variance results in values of δc/c ∼ 0.1 on average (circle with error bars in Figure 4C). The true noise level could be even lower, since we have no way of correcting for nucleus-to-nucleus variability in the staining process. Before proceeding it is important to emphasize the limitations of our analysis. We have treated the relationship between Bcd and Hb as if there were no other factors involved. In the extreme one could imagine (although this is not true) that both Bcd and Hb concentrations vary with anterior-posterior position in the embryo but are not related causally. In fact, if we look along the dorsal-ventral axis, there are systematic variations in Bcd concentration (cf. Figure 3), and the Hb concentrations are correlated with these variations, suggesting that Bcd and Hb really are linked to each other rather than to some other anterior-posterior position signal. It has been suggested, however, that hb expression may be responding to signals in addition to Bcd (Howard and ten Wolde, 2005Howard M. ten Wolde P.R.

If these signals ultimately are driven by the local Bcd concentration itself, then it remains sensible to say that the Hunchback concentration provides a readout of Bcd concentration with an accuracy of ∼10%. If additional signals are not correlated with the local Bcd concentration, then collapsing our description into an input/output relation between Bcd and Hb treats these other variables as an extrinsic source of noise; the intrinsic reliability of the transformation from Bcd to Hb would have to be even better than what we observe. The observed precision of ∼10% is difficult to reconcile with the physical limits (Equation 3) given the available averaging time. If the precision cannot be increased to the observed levels by averaging over time, perhaps the embryo can achieve some averaging over space: If the Hb level in one nucleus reflects the average Bcd levels in its N neighbors, the limiting noise level in Equation 3 should decrease by a factor of N. If communication among nuclei is mediated by diffusion of a protein with diffusion constant comparable to that of Bcd itself, then in a time T it will cover a radius r∼4DT and hence an area A ∼ 4πDT.

https://openalex.org/W2083459920,"Inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity has been identified as a prerequisite for the transformation of human cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which PP2A activity is inhibited in human cancers are currently unclear. In this study, we describe a cellular inhibitor of PP2A with oncogenic activity. The protein, designated Cancerous Inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), interacts directly with the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc, inhibits PP2A activity toward c-Myc serine 62 (S62), and thereby prevents c-Myc proteolytic degradation. In addition to its function in c-Myc stabilization, CIP2A promotes anchorage-independent cell growth and in vivo tumor formation. The oncogenic activity of CIP2A is demonstrated by transformation of human cells by overexpression of CIP2A. Importantly, CIP2A is overexpressed in two common human malignancies, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and colon cancer. Thus, our data show that CIP2A is a human oncoprotein that inhibits PP2A and stabilizes c-Myc in human malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2011879414,"The RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) is a ribonucleoprotein particle composed of a single-stranded short interfering RNA (siRNA) and an endonucleolytically active Argonaute protein, capable of cleaving mRNAs complementary to the siRNA. The mechanism by which RISC cleaves a target RNA is well understood, however it remains enigmatic how RISC finds its target RNA. Here, we show, both in vitro and in vivo, that the accessibility of the target site correlates directly with the efficiency of cleavage, demonstrating that RISC is unable to unfold structured RNA. In the course of target recognition, RISC transiently contacts single-stranded RNA nonspecifically and promotes siRNA-target RNA annealing. Furthermore, the 5' part of the siRNA within RISC creates a thermodynamic threshold that determines the stable association of RISC and the target RNA. We therefore provide mechanistic insights by revealing features of RISC and target RNAs that are crucial to achieve efficiency and specificity in RNA interference."
https://openalex.org/W2171005709,"Patterning in multicellular organisms results from spatial gradients in morphogen concentration, but the dynamics of these gradients remain largely unexplored. We characterize, through in vivo optical imaging, the development and stability of the Bicoid morphogen gradient in Drosophila embryos that express a Bicoid-eGFP fusion protein. The gradient is established rapidly (approximately 1 hr after fertilization), with nuclear Bicoid concentration rising and falling during mitosis. Interphase levels result from a rapid equilibrium between Bicoid uptake and removal. Initial interphase concentration in nuclei in successive cycles is constant (+/-10%), demonstrating a form of gradient stability, but it subsequently decays by approximately 30%. Both direct photobleaching measurements and indirect estimates of Bicoid-eGFP diffusion constants (D < or = 1 microm(2)/s) provide a consistent picture of Bicoid transport on short ( approximately min) time scales but challenge traditional models of long-range gradient formation. A new model is presented emphasizing the possible role of nuclear dynamics in shaping and scaling the gradient."

https://openalex.org/W2149240296,"The high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), originally identified as an architectural nuclear protein, exhibits an inflammatory cytokine-like activity in the extracellular space. Here we show that treatment with neutralizing anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody (mAb; 200 microg, twice) remarkably ameliorated brain infarction induced by 2-h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats, even when the mAb was administered after the start of reperfusion. Consistent with the 90% reduction in infarct size, the accompanying neurological deficits in locomotor function were significantly improved. Anti-HMGB1 mAb inhibited the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, the activation of microglia, the expression of TNF-alpha and iNOS, and suppressed the activity of MMP-9, whereas it had little effect on blood flow. Intracerebroventricular injection of HMGB1 increased the severity of infarction. Immunohistochemical study revealed that HMGB1 immunoreactivity in the cell nuclei decreased or disappeared in the affected areas, suggesting the release of HMGB1 into the extracellular space. These results indicate that HMGB1 plays a critical role in the development of brain infarction through the amplification of plural inflammatory responses in the ischemic region and could be an outstandingly suitable target for the treatment. Intravenous injection of neutralizing anti-HMGB1 mAb provides a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke."

We find that eIF4AIII, a core exon junction complex (EJC) component loaded onto mRNAs by pre-mRNA splicing, is associated with neuronal mRNA granules and dendritic mRNAs. eIF4AIII knockdown markedly increases both synaptic strength and GLUR1 AMPA receptor abundance at synapses. eIF4AIII depletion also increases ARC, a protein required for maintenance of long-term potentiation; arc mRNA, one of the most abundant in dendrites, is a natural target for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Numerous new NMD candidates, some with potential to affect synaptic activity, were also identified computationally. Two models are presented for how translation-dependent decay pathways such as NMD might advantageously function as critical brakes for protein synthesis in cells such as neurons that are highly dependent on spatially and temporally restricted protein expression."

Upon infection, the leukocyte-specific protein coronin 1 is actively recruited to mycobacterial phagosomes, where it blocks lysosomal delivery by an unknown mechanism. Analysis of macrophages from coronin 1-deficient mice showed that coronin 1 is dispensable for F-actin-dependent processes such as phagocytosis, motility, and membrane ruffling. However, upon mycobacterial infection, coronin 1 was required for activation of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, thereby blocking lysosomal delivery of mycobacteria. In the absence of coronin 1, calcineurin activity did not occur, resulting in lysosomal delivery and killing of mycobacteria. Furthermore, blocking calcineurin activation with cyclosporin A or FK506 led to lysosomal delivery and intracellular mycobacterial killing. These results demonstrate a role for coronin 1 in activating Ca2+ dependent signaling processes in macrophages and reveal a function for calcineurin in the regulation of phagosome-lysosome fusion upon mycobacterial infection.

Mycobacterium spp. include highly successful pathogens that evade innate immunity by manipulating the host to ensure long-term survival. One of the strategies employed by pathogenic mycobacteria relies on their capacity to block phagosomal maturation; while, normally, all microbes that are internalized by macrophages are transferred to lysosomal organelles followed by their degradation, mycobacteria have evolved strategies to block delivery to lysosomes (Armstrong and Hart, 1971Armstrong J.A.

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), thereby ensuring their survival within phagosomes. The capacity of mycobacteria to block phagosome-lysosome fusion relies on the expression of several virulence factors that ensure their retention within mycobacterial phagosomes (Vergne et al., 2005Vergne I. Chua J. Lee H.H. Lucas M. Belisle J. Deretic V. Mechanism of phagolysosome biogenesis block by viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

At the host side, a number of factors have been characterized that modulate the outcome of the entry of mycobacteria into macrophages. For example, the small GTPase LRG-47 appears to be involved in the regulation of phagosome maturation (MacMicking, 2005MacMicking J.D. Immune control of phagosomal bacteria by p47 GTPases.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Singh et al., 2006Singh S.B. Davis A.S. Taylor G.A. Deretic V. Human IRGM induces autophagy to eliminate intracellular mycobacteria.Science. 2006; 313: 1438-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the plasma-membrane component cholesterol is involved in allowing mycobacteria to enter macrophages, possibly by modulating signal transduction following engagement of surface receptors, or via rearrangement of the membrane-cytoskeleton network during phagocytosis (Gatfield and Pieters, 2000Gatfield J. Pieters J. Essential role for cholesterol in entry of mycobacteria into macrophages.Science. 2000; 288: 1647-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, Peyron et al., 2000Peyron P. Bordier C.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 5186-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Finally, mycobacteria actively recruit coronin 1 (also known as P57 or TACO, for tryptophan aspartate containing coat protein), a host cytoskeleton-associated molecule that links the cytoskeleton with the plasma membrane in leukocytes (Gatfield et al., 2005Gatfield J.

However, in yeast, upon deletion of the crn gene, actin dynamics as well as F-actin-dependent processes remain unaltered (Heil-Chapdelaine et al., 1998Heil-Chapdelaine R.A. Tran N.K. Cooper J.A. The role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae coronin in the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian macrophages no biological activity has been assigned to any of the coronin isoforms expressed. To analyze a role for coronin 1 in vivo, we generated mice containing a targeted deletion of the coronin 1 gene. In this work, we show that in macrophages, coronin 1 was dispensable for F-actin-dependent processes such as cell motility, phagocytosis, and macropinocytosis. However, upon mycobacterial infection of wild-type macrophages, coronin 1 was essential for the activation of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, thereby blocking lysosomal delivery of mycobacteria. In the absence of coronin 1, calcineurin was not activated, resulting in lysosomal transfer and death of internalized mycobacteria. Coronin 1 is therefore an essential survival factor for mycobacteria within macrophages through activation of calcineurin. To analyze a function for coronin 1 in macrophages, coronin 1 expression was ablated using gene targeting in mice (Figure S1). The resulting coronin 1-deficient mice were fertile, reproduced normally, and appeared healthy. Bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from coronin 1-deficient mice showed the absence of coronin 1 by immunoblotting as well as immunostaining on fixed cells, whereas the F-actin and tubulin cytoskeleton was not affected (Figures 1A–1C). Since in Dictyostelium coronin is an F-actin-interacting protein (de Hostos et al., 1991de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G. Coronin, an actin binding protein of Dictyostelium discoideum localized to cell surface projections, has sequence similarities to G protein beta subunits.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4097-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether coronin 1 is involved in the redistribution of F- versus G-actin using a biochemical assay to analyze in situ F-actin levels. To that end, macrophages from either wild-type or coronin 1-deficient animals were lysed under conditions that preserve F-actin, and the F-actin cytoskeleton was isolated as described in Experimental Procedures. As a control, macrophages were treated either with the F-actin-stabilizing compound Jasplakinolide (Bubb et al., 1994Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L. Korn E.D. Jasplakinolide, a cytotoxic natural product, induces actin polymerization and competitively inhibits the binding of phalloidin to F-actin.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the F-actin-depolymerizing reagent Latrunculin B (Spector et al., 1989Spector I. Shochet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Latrunculins–novel marine macrolides that disrupt microfilament organization and affect cell growth: I. Comparison with cytochalasin D.Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) prior to cell lysis. Whereas Jasplakinolide and Latrunculin B resulted in significant changes in the ratio of G- versus F-actin, the presence or absence of coronin 1 did not alter the ratio of F- versus G-actin (Figure 1D). To analyze the capacity of macrophages to spread on a surface upon activation, macrophages were incubated with the phorbol ester PMA for 30 min, fixed, and stained for actin. Both wild-type as well as coronin 1-deficient macrophages showed similar spreading and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Figure 1E). Also, in vitro proliferation of macrophages was unaltered in the absence of coronin 1 (Figure 1F). To analyze whether in macrophages the absence of coronin 1 affects migration, as is the case in Dictyostelium (de Hostos et al., 1993de Hostos E.L. Rehfuess C. Bradtke B. Waddell D.R. Albrecht R. Murphy J. Gerisch G. Dictyostelium mutants lacking the cytoskeletal protein coronin are defective in cytokinesis and cell motility.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), macrophages from wild-type or coronin 1-deficient macrophages were analyzed by Transwell assay. Both upon stimulation of the cells by zymosan, as well as by the macrophage-specific migration factor monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), similar numbers of macrophages migrated into the lower chamber (Figure 1G). To analyze migration of wild-type and coronin 1-deficient macrophages in vivo, recruitment of macrophages to the peritoneum upon stimulation was analyzed. Both wild-type as well as coronin 1-deficient macrophages were recruited in similar numbers to the peritoneal cavity (Figure 1H). Finally, macrophages derived from wild-type or coronin 1-deficient mice were analyzed by video microscopy to asses membrane dynamics and random cell movements in the presence and absence of coronin 1. As shown in Figures 1I and 1J and the accompanying videos, membrane dynamics and ruffling as well as cell motility was similar in wild-type and coronin 1-deficient macrophages. Together, these results suggest that coronin 1 is dispensable for these F-actin-mediated processes in macrophages. In Dictyostelium, coronin is involved in phagocytosis and macropinocytosis, and several reports have suggested that coronin 1 may perform a similar function in macrophages (Schuller et al., 2001Schuller S. Neefjes J. Ottenhoff T. Thole J. Young D. Coronin is involved in uptake of Mycobacterium bovis BCG in human macrophages but not in phagosome maintenance.Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Yan et al., 2005Yan M. Collins R.F. Grinstein S. Trimble W.S. Coronin-1 function is required for phagosome formation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3077-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To directly analyze a role for coronin 1 in phagocytosis, macrophages derived from either coronin 1−/− mice or wild-type littermates were incubated with human serum treated Lactobacillus casei expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) or IgG-coated fluorescent polystyrene beads for 30 min at 37°C. Both wild-type as well as coronin 1−/− macrophages were found to have a similar capacity to take up cargo by either complement receptor or Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis (Figures 2A and 2B). Similarly, uptake of latex beads, E. coli, as well as Salmonella was identical in macrophages derived from wild-type or coronin 1-deficient mice (Figures 2C–2E). To analyze a potential role for coronin 1 in phagocytosis in more detail, wild-type or coronin 1−/− macrophages were incubated with beads ranging in size from 1 to 6 μm, and the amount of beads phagocytosed as well as the number of beads internalized per cell was quantified. No qualitative or quantitative differences were apparent between wild-type and coronin 1-deficient macrophages (Figure S2). Finally, phagocytosis of latex beads by wild-type or coronin 1−/− macrophages was analyzed by video microscopy, showing no qualitative differences (Figure 2F and the accompanying videos). Analysis of macropinocytosis showed that both the number of macropinosomes as well as the percentage of cells undergoing macropinocytosis was identical in the absence or presence of coronin 1 (Figures 3A and 3B). To analyze qualitative or temporal differences in macropinocytic activity between wild-type and coronin 1−/− cells, macrophages were stimulated with PMA (Albrecht et al., 2006Albrecht I. Gatfield J.

No differences in macropinosome formation were apparent in wild-type or coronin 1-deficient cells (Figure 3C and the accompanying video sequences). Together these data establish that coronin 1 is not essential for phagocytosis or macropinocytosis in macrophages. Although coronin 1 does not participate directly in phagocytosis (see above), upon infection with mycobacteria, coronin 1 is recruited around nascent phagosomes and is actively retained by living bacilli on mycobacterial phagosomes (Ferrari et al., 1999Ferrari G.

To assess whether coronin 1 plays a role in the internalization of mycobacteria, wild-type or coronin 1-deficient macrophages were stimulated as indicated in Figures 4A and 4B prior to infection with M. bovis BCG expressing the GFP (Dhandayuthapani et al., 1995Dhandayuthapani S.

Both in wild-type as well as in coronin 1−/− macrophages similar numbers of mycobacteria were internalized (Figures 4A and 4B). Furthermore, video microscopy revealed no qualitative differences in the uptake process between wild-type and coronin 1-deficient macrophages (Figure 4C). However, analysis of the intracellular localization of mycobacteria showed that while in wild-type macrophages, as expected, mycobacteria were predominantly retained in nonlysosomal phagosomes, in macrophages lacking coronin 1, mycobacteria were largely present in lysosomal organelles as judged by colocalization of mycobacteria and lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) or the acidotrophic compound LysoTracker (Figures 4D and 4E). In addition, subcellular fractionation by organelle electrophoresis (Hasan et al., 1997Hasan Z. Schlax C. Kuhn L. Lefkovits I. Young D. Thole J. Pieters J.

The lysosomal delivery of mycobacteria could result in their killing through mycobacteriocidal activities residing within lysosomes. To directly analyze bacterial viability, wild-type or coronin 1−/− macrophages were incubated with mycobacteria for the times indicated in Figures 4G and 4H, and mycobacterial proliferation and survival were analyzed by incorporation of tritiated uracil and colony-forming unit enumeration, respectively. While in wild-type macrophages, as expected, mycobacteria were able to proliferate, in coronin 1-deficient macrophages bacteria could not proliferate and failed to survive (Figures 4G and 4H). Together, these results demonstrate that coronin 1 prevented lysosomal delivery and mediated intracellular survival of mycobacteria. Since in T cells, coronin 1 regulates Ca2+ entry (P.M., J.M., R.J., I.A., C. Blum, R. Ceredig, H.-R. Rodewald, A.G., J.P., unpublished data), we analyzed whether in macrophages, the role for coronin 1 in sustaining mycobacterial viability was due to its role in modulating intracellular Ca2+ concentration. To analyze intracellular Ca2+ fluxes, macrophages from wild-type or coronin 1-deficient animals were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Rhod-2 AM. Upon addition of mycobacteria to Rhod-2-loaded macrophages, the cells responded with an immediate raise in cytosolic Ca2+ (Figure 5A, blue line). In contrast, when coronin 1-deficient macrophages were incubated with mycobacteria, no increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was observed (Figure 5A, red line). The difference in cytosolic calcium release between wild-type and coronin 1-deficient macrophages was not due to an intrinsic problem with the intracellular Ca2+ stores, since treatment of the cells with thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of the sarco-endoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase (Thastrup et al., 1990Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Thapsigargin, a tumor promoter, discharges intracellular Ca2+ stores by specific inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2(+)-ATPase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2928) Google Scholar), induced store release in both wild-type as well as coronin 1-deficient macrophages, whereas subsequent Ca2+ entry was drastically depressed in the absence of coronin 1 (Figure S3). To analyze whether the coronin 1-mediated Ca2+ influx was responsible for the block in lysosomal delivery and survival of mycobacteria, calcium was chelated using either the cell permeable chelator BAPTA-AM or cell impermeable reagent BAPTA before and during the internalization of mycobacteria. Subsequently, the degree of lysosomal localization as well as intracellular survival was analyzed as judged by colocalization with LAMP or LysoTracker as well as incorporation of 3H-uracil and colony-forming unit enumeration. As shown in Figures 5B–5F, in the presence of BAPTA-AM as well as BAPTA, virtually all mycobacteria were transported to lysosomes and killed, to a similar degree as in coronin 1-deficient macrophages. To directly analyze a role for coronin 1 in mediating Ca2+ release that results in blocking lysosomal delivery of mycobacteria, coronin 1-deficient macrophages were incubated in the presence of a low dose of the Ca2+ ionophore calcimycin to increase cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Subsequently, the intracellular residence of the internalized mycobacteria was analyzed by colocalization with LysoTracker. As shown in Figure 5D, the presence of calcimycin prevented the lysosomal delivery of mycobacteria in coronin 1-deficient macrophages to a similar degree as wild-type macrophages. The block of lysosomal transfer by calcimycin treatment of coronin 1-deficient macrophages was confirmed by organelle electrophoresis (Figure S4). Furthermore, mycobacterial proliferation and survival in coronin 1−/− macrophages was drastically enhanced in the presence of calcimycin (Figures 5E and 5F). An immediate result of an increase in cytosolic calcium is the activation of calcineurin (Winslow et al., 2003Winslow M.M. Neilson J.R. Crabtree G.R. Calcium signalling in lymphocytes.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To assess whether calcineurin was differentially activated upon mycobacterial infection in macrophages, wild-type or coronin 1-deficient macrophages were infected with mycobacteria followed by the determination of calcineurin activity. While calcineurin phosphatase activity was close to background levels in lysates from both wild-type and coronin 1-deficient cells, infection of mycobacteria resulted in a drastic increase in calcineurin activity in wild-type lysates, whereas no increase was observed in lysates from coronin 1-deficient macrophages (Figure 5G). Incubation of macrophages with the Ca2+ ionophore calcimycin resulted in calcineurin activation in both wild-type as well as coronin 1-deficient macrophages (Figure 5H), showing no intrinsic defect with calcineurin activation in the absence of coronin 1. Also, coronin 1 was not involved in altering the subcellular distribution of calcineurin following mycobacterial uptake, since similar amounts of calcineurin were recovered from cytosol or membrane fractions in infected wild-type or coronin 1-deficient macrophages (Figure S5). Together these data indicate that while in wild-type macrophages, infection of mycobacteria induced calcineurin activation, in the absence of coronin 1 calcineurin was not activated. To investigate whether the coronin 1-dependent phagosomal retention and survival of mycobacteria was dependent on calcineurin-induced gene transcription (Gallo et al., 2006Gallo E.M. Cante-Barrett K. Crabtree G.R. Lymphocyte calcium signaling from membrane to nucleus.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), mycobacteria were internalized in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. While cycloheximide efficiently blocked protein synthesis without compromising macrophage viability, the presence of cycloheximide did not result in alteration of the intracellular routing or survival of mycobacteria (Figure S6), indicating that the coronin 1-mediated block of phagosome-lysosome fusion did not occur as a result of induction of translation due to the activation of transcription factors. To further substantiate that activation of calcineurin was responsible for prevention of lysosomal transfer and death of internalized mycobacteria we made use of the specific calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK506. Cyclosporin A and FK506 are chemically unrelated natural products that are highly specific inhibitors of calcineurin activity (Liu et al., 1991Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Calcineurin is a common target of cyclophilin-cyclosporin A and FKBP-FK506 complexes.Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar). To analyze the consequence of calcineurin inhibition on intracellular mycobacterial trafficking and survival, macrophages were incubated with either cyclosporin A or FK506, followed by infection with M. bovis BCG. Staining of fixed cells for mycobacteria as well as lysosomes showed that both inhibitors induced a complete relocation of mycobacteria to lysosomes (Figures 6A and 6B). Similarly, when murine J774 macrophages were infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv in the presence of cyclosporin A or FK506, the majority of the internalized mycobacteria were found within lysosomes (Figure 6C). Furthermore, mycobacteria were unable to survive and proliferate within macrophages when calcineurin was blocked by either cyclosporin A or FK506, as analyzed by mycobacterial proliferation (Figure 6D) or colony-forming units enumeration (Figure 6E). Together these results show that coronin 1-dependent calcineurin activation is essential to allow intracellular survival of mycobacteria within macrophages. To reveal whether the differential trafficking in wild-type versus coronin 1-deficient macrophages could be demonstrated in vivo, coronin 1-deficient mice or wild-type littermates were infected with either M. bovis BCG or M. tuberculosis H37Rv.

Bile acids are amphipathic cholesterol metabolites essential for the absorption of lipophilic nutrients and cholesterol homeostasis (1Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). They are synthesized by the liver and stored in the gall bladder (2Chiang J.Y. J.

The cycle of gallbladder filling and emptying controls the flow of bile into the intestine for digestion. Because bile acid accumulation can lead to hepatotoxicity and cholestasis, this process is tightly regulated (3Trauner M. Boyer J.L. Curr. Opin.

Bile acids bind to the farnesoid X receptor, a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-regulated transcription factors, which is highly expressed in liver and intestine. In the liver, farnesoid X receptor activation represses the transcription of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), 2The abbreviations used are:CYP7A1cholesterol 7α-hydroxylaseFGFfibroblast growth factorFGFRfibroblast growth factor receptorFRSFGFR substrateKLBKlotho betaERKextracellular signal-regulated kinasepERKphosphorylated ERKPBSphosphate-buffered salineRTreverse transcriptionsiRNAsmall interfering RNA , a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of bile acids (4Jelinek D.F.

Although FGF19 binds only to FGFR4, the liver-specific activity of FGF19 cannot be explained solely by the distribution of this receptor because of its wide tissue expression. Klotho beta (KLB) encodes a 130-kDa type 1 transmembrane protein with a short (29 amino acids) intracellular domain that has no predicted kinase activity (13Ito S. Kinoshita S. Shiraishi N.

KLB has two extracellular glycosidase domains that lack a characteristic glutamic acid residue essential for enzymatic activity. Klb-deficient mice (Klb-/-) have increased CYP7A1 expression and decreased gallbladder size, indicating that Klb-/- mice can no longer suppress bile acid synthesis (6Inagaki T. Choi M. Moschetta A.

In this study, we demonstrate that KLB acts as an FGFR4 co-receptor required for FGF19 binding, intracellular signaling, and downstream modulation of gene expression. KLB and FGFR4 are co-expressed in the liver where they mediate the tissue-specific activity of FGF19. DNA Constructs—Total RNA from HepG2 cells was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The KLB gene was cloned using the SuperScript III One-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) and the following primers: forward, 5′-CGGGCGCTAGCATGAAGCCAGGCTGTGCGGCAGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CAGTGGATCCTTACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCGCTAACAACTCTCTTGCCTTTCTTTC-3′. The resulting KLB PCR product was digested with NheI and BamHI and ligated into pCMV-Tag4A (Stratagene) to obtain the full-length KLB with a FLAG tag at the C-terminal end (pCMVKLB-FLAG). The secreted KLB extracellular domain (KLBΔTM) was obtained by PCR using pCMVKLB-FLAG as the template and the following primers: forward, 5′-GAA TTC CAC CAT GAA GCC AGG CTG TGC GGC AGG ATC TCC AG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGC GCG CCG ACA AGG AAT AAG CAG ACA GTG CAC TCT G-3′. The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and AscI and ligated into pRK5_c-His (Genentech Inc.). The human FGFR4 cDNA was cloned from total HepG2 cell RNA using the SuperScript III One-step RT-PCR kit and the following primers: forward, 5′-CCGCCGGATATCATGCGGCTGCTGCTGGCCCTGTTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGCCGGAATTCTGTCTGCACCCCAGACCCGAAGGGG-3′. The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRV and EcoRI and ligated into pIRESpuro3 (Clontech). KLBΔTM-conditioned Medium—HEK 293 cells were transfected with the KLBΔTM or the corresponding empty vector and maintained in serum-free PS25 medium for 72-96 h. The resulting media were filtered, supplemented with HEPES, pH 7.2 (final concentration 40 mm), concentrated, and evaluated for KLBΔTM content by immunoblotting using a KLB-specific antibody (MAB3738 antibody; R&D Systems). Co-precipitation Assay—The control or KLBΔTM-conditioned medium was supplemented with Triton X-100 (Calbiochem) to a final concentration of 0.5% and incubated with or without 0.5 μg/ml FGFR-Fc (R&D Systems), 0.5 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), 1 μg/ml FGF19 (R&D Systems), and 10 μl of protein A-agarose gel (Sigma) at 4 °C for 18 h. The affinity matrix was centrifuged and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/0.5% Triton X-100 and once with PBS. Immunoblot analysis was performed using antibodies against KLB (R&D Systems), FGF19 (clone 1A6; Genentech Inc.), or FGFR4 (clone 8G11; Genentech Inc.) and a horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated antibody against human IgG (Jackson Immunochemical). Cell Culture and Stable Cell Lines—HEK 293, HepG2, and Hep3B cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in an F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium mix (50:50) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. HEK 293 cells stably expressing empty vector, hFGFR4, KLB-FLAG, or hFGFR4 and KLB-FLAG were created and grown in selective medium containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin and 2.5 μg/ml puromycin. Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK 293 cells that transiently (24-48 h transfection) or stably expressed empty vector, hFGFR4, KLB-FLAG, or hFGFR4 and KLB-FLAG were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Total protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein for each sample lysate were incubated in the absence or presence of 0.5 μg/ml heparin along with control- or FGF19-conditioned medium and immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-FGFR4 (1G7; Genentech, Inc.) agarose affinity matrix at 4 °C for 18 h. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed twice with PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 and twice with PBS and then analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against KLB, FGFR4, and FGF19. FGF Pathway Activation—HEK 293 cells transiently or stably expressing empty vector, hFGFR4, KLB-FLAG, or hFGFR4 and KLB-FLAG were starved of serum for 24 h before they were exposed to 0-500 ng/ml FGF19 (R&D Systems) for 10 min. Hep3B or HepG2 cells were transfected with control or KLB siRNA for 72 h (starved of serum for the final 24 h) before exposure to 0 or 100 ng/ml FGF19 (Genentech, Inc.) for 10 min. In each case, cells were treated with 20 ng/ml FGF1 (FGF acidic, R&D Systems) or 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Roche Applied Science) as positive controls. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology) supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 (Sigma). Equal amounts of protein were analyzed by immunoblot using antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2), phospho-FRS2 (pFRS2), ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), FRS2 (Upstate Biotechnology), KLB (R&D Systems), or β-actin (Sigma). Quantitation of FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation was performed as described previously, with modifications (15Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.-J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Briefly, the densitometric analysis of the pFRS2, pERK1/2, total FRS2, and total ERK1/2 protein bands was done using NIH ImageJ software. The normalized relative density values (RDV) were determined as follows: RDV pFRS2 = (DV pFRS2 - DV background)/(DV total FRS2 - DV background). Normalized RDV pFRS2 = [(ΣRDV pFRS2)/n for a given treatment] - [(ΣRDV pFRS2)/n at no treatment] ± S.E. (n = 3). The same method was used to determine the normalized RDV for pERK1/2. Values were plotted as normalized RDV. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Specific primers and fluorogenic probes were used to amplify and quantitate gene expression (see the supplemental data for sequences) (16Winer J. Jung C.K. Shackel I. Williams P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The gene-specific signals were normalized to the RPL19 housekeeping gene. All Taq-Man RT-PCR reagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). A minimum of a triplicate set of data was analyzed for each condition. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. siRNA Transfection—KLB and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) siRNA oligos were from Dharmacon (see supplemental data for sequences). The various siRNA duplexes were transfected using the DharmaFECT transfection kit (Dharmacon) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. In Silico Expression Analysis—For expression analysis, box- and whisker-plots were generated with the normalized gene expression data extracted from the BioExpress™ data base (Gene Logic, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The distribution of KLB and FGFR4 expression was evaluated using the signals associated to the probes 244276_at and 204579_at, respectively. In Vivo Experiments—All animal protocols were approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Female FVB mice at 5 or 6 weeks old were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. The mice were provided standard feed and water ad libitum until 12 h before injection, at which time feed was removed. Mice were given intravenous injections of vehicle (PBS) or 1 mg/kg FGF19. After 30 min, mice from all groups were sacrificed, and tissue samples were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. Total RNA from frozen tissue samples was prepared using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). Groups of 3-5 animals were analyzed for each condition. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. and were analyzed by the Student's t test. KLB Forms a Complex with FGFR4, FGF19, and Heparin—We first tested the binding of KLB to FGF19 and FGFRs using a co-precipitation assay. FGF19, heparin and different FGFR-Fc fusion proteins were incubated in conditioned medium containing KLBΔTM. The protein interactions were then analyzed by co-precipitation. Strikingly, we found that KLB and FGF19 co-associated only with FGFR4 and were pulled down only with FGFR4-Fc (Fig. 1A). We used the same assay to evaluate the contribution of each component to the complex formation. Control or KLBΔTM containing conditioned medium was incubated in the presence or absence of FGFR4-Fc, FGF19, and/or heparin. In the absence of heparin and FGF19, no interaction was detected between KLB and FGFR4-Fc (Fig. 1B). Heparin was a weak promoter, whereas FGF19 was a strong promoter of the KLB-FGFR4 interaction. The maximal level of stabilization of the KLB-FGFR4-Fc interaction occurred in the presence of both heparin and FGF19. Conversely, FGF19 binding to FGFR4-Fc required the presence of heparin or KLB. The maximal level of FGF19 binding to FGFR4 occurred when both heparin and KLB were included in the reaction. These data demonstrate that KLB is sufficient to support FGF19 binding to FGFR4. They also show that KLB promotes the previously demonstrated heparin-dependent interaction of FGF19 with FGFR4 (9Xie M.H. Holcomb I. Deuel B. Dowd P. Huang A. Vagts A. Foster J. Liang J. Brush J. Gu Q. Hillan K. Goddard A. Gurney A.L. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Therefore, each individual component contributes to the stability of the FGF19-FGFR4-KLB-heparin complex. To test whether KLB and FGFR4 also participate in the formation of a complex with FGF19 and heparin at the cell surface, we evaluated the ability of FGFR4 and KLB to immunoprecipitate FGF19 from lysates of transiently or stably transfected cells in the presence or the absence of heparin. No detectable FGF19 was co-precipitated from lysates of cells transfected with only a control or an FGFR4 expression vector (Fig. 1, C and D). KLB pulled down FGF19 from KLB-transfected cell lysate only in the presence of heparin, indicating that KLB expression promotes heparin-dependent FGF19 binding to the endogenous HEK 293 FGFR4. In lysate from KLB- and FGFR4-co-transfected cells, KLB and FGFR4 readily pulled down FGF19. This interaction was further stabilized in the presence of heparin (Fig. 1, C and D). These data show that KLB is required for FGF19 binding to the cell surface FGFR4 and that heparin promotes this interaction. In addition, FGFR4 and KLB readily interacted in a heparin- and ligand-independent manner in co-transfected cells. This result contrasts with the heparin- and ligand-dependent complex formation observed with the secreted chimeric FGFR4 and KLB proteins. This discrepancy indicates a role for the KLB and FGFR4 transmembrane domains in the complex formation. To test the hypothesis that KLB and FGFR4 form a constitutive complex at the cell surface, we evaluated whether KLB co-immunoprecipitated with FGFR4 from HepG2 cell lysates in the absence of FGF19 or heparin. Incubation of HepG2 cell lysates with an antibody against FGFR4-immunoprecipitated FGFR4 and KLB, whereas no protein was immunoprecipitated with the control antibody (Fig. 1E), showing that the endogenous transmembrane KLB and FGFR4 form a constitutive heparin- and ligand-independent complex. KLB Is Required for FGF19 Signaling—To test whether KLB contributes to the activation of the FGF19 signaling pathway, we evaluated the effects of FGF19 on FRS2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in KLB- and/or FGFR4-transfected HEK 293 cells as well as in controls. FGF19 did not promote FRS2 or ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cells transfected with an empty expression vector (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). HEK 293 cells transfected with KLB or FGFR4 showed only a weak, dose-dependent increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation but no detectable FRS2 phosphorylation following exposure to FGF19. The co-transfection of FGFR4 with KLB promoted FGF19 signaling in HEK 293 cells, indicated by the robust, dose-dependent increase of both FRS2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. One possible explanation for this effect is that local, high concentrations of FGF19 and FGFR4 allow for weak signaling in the absence of KLB. However, because FGF19 has an endocrine function and its average circulating concentration is 193 ± 36 pg/ml (a range of 49 to 590 pg/ml), this explanation is unlikely (8Lundasen T. Galman C. Angelin B. Rudling M. J. Intern. Med. 2006; 260: 530-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Therefore the robust induction of FGF19 signaling by KLB is likely to occur at physiological concentrations of FGF19. KLB Is Required for FGF19 Downstream Modulation of Gene Expression—Because KLB is required for FGF19 signaling, we evaluated the effect of FGF19 on KLB expression in various cell lines. We detected high KLB expression in liver cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B) but only traces in kidney (HEK 293) or colon cell lines (Fig. 3A, SW620 and Colo205). Upon exposure to FGF19, KLB expression in HepG2 and Hep3B cells was gradually repressed to 50-60% the level of unexposed cells after 6 h, and it remained at this level for at least 24 h. Exposure to FGF19 did not affect KLB expression levels in the other cell lines. The repression of KLB expression by FGF19 might be a regulatory negative feedback mechanism in liver cells. Because a plethora of physiological and pathological stimuli induce the genes of the Fos and Jun family in a wide variety of cell types, we tested whether FGF19 modulates c-Fos, JunB, and c-Jun expression in various cell lines (17Ashida R. Tominaga K. Sasaki E. Watanabe T. Fujiwara Y. Oshitani N. Higuchi K. Mitsuyama S. Iwao H. Arakawa T. Inflammopharmacology. 2005; 13: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Hess J. Angel P. Schorpp-Kistner M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5965-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 19Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). FGF19 up-regulated c-Fos and JunB expression, as well as c-Jun expression to a lesser extent, in KLB-expressing cells (Fig, 3, B-D, HepG2 and Hep3B). The induction of c-Fos, JunB, and c-Jun expression occurred within 30 min of exposure to FGF19, and in most cases, expression returned to basal levels after 6 h. JunB expression remained elevated for at least 24 h in Hep3B cells (Fig. 3C). To test whether KLB promotes FGF19 signaling and c-Fos induction in Hep3B and HepG2 cells, we inhibited KLB expression using specific siRNAs. KLB siRNA transfection significantly reduced KLB mRNA and protein expression in Hep3B (Fig. 3, E and G) and HepG2 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). The individual transfection of four different KLB siRNAs significantly attenuated FGF19-mediated FRS2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3F). In addition, transfection of Hep3B cells with KLB siRNA inhibited FGF19-mediated c-Fos induction by 62-80% compared with the control cells (Fig. 3G). Similarly, transfection of HepG2 cells with KLB siRNA reduced the levels of FGF19-dependent FRS2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation as well as c-Fos induction as compared with the control cells (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that KLB expression is required for FGF19-dependent pathway activation and c-Fos induction. To further assess the participation of KLB in FGF19-mediated c-Fos induction, we transfected HEK 293 cells with empty, KLB, or FGFR4 vector or a combination of KLB and FGFR4 expression vectors and exposed the cells to FGF19. Only cells transfected with both KLB and FGFR4 expression vectors induced c-Fos in response to FGF19 (Fig. 3H). These data indicate that KLB is required for FGF19 pathway activation and modulation of gene regulation. KLB and FGFR4 Distribution Dictate FGF19 Tissue-specific Activity—We evaluated KLB and FGFR4 expression in a variety of human tissues by analyzing the BioExpress data base (Gene Logic, Inc.). In decreasing order of signal intensity, KLB was expressed in adipose, liver, pancreas, and breast tissues (Fig. 4A). In decreasing order of signal intensity, FGFR4 was expressed in liver, lung, gall bladder, small intestine, pancreas, colon, lymphoid, ovary, and breast tissues (Fig. 4B). These data show that KLB expression is restricted to only a few tissues, whereas FGFR4 expression is more widely distributed. A high level of co-expression of KLB and FGFR4 was observed only in liver and pancreas. Because the expression of KLB and FGFR4 are required for FGF19 activity, these findings suggest that liver and pancreas are the major organs in which they are active. Marginal levels of KLB and FGFR4 expression were also observed in breast tissues. KLB was highly expressed in adipose tissues, but the absence of FGFR4 precludes the function of FGF19 in this tissue. To test the hypothesis that FGF19 acts only on tissues that express both FGFR4 and KLB, we first surveyed Klb and FGFR4 distribution in various mouse organs using semiquantitative RT-PCR. The relative mRNA levels represent the relative -fold expression compared with brain (organ with the lowest expression surveyed). Klb was predominantly expressed in liver (Fig. 4C). Lower levels of Klb expression were also found in adipose and colon tissues. Additional organs tested showed marginal expression of Klb. FGFR4 was highly expressed in liver, lung, adrenals, kidney, and colon (Fig. 4D). Lower levels of FGFR4 expression were also observed in intestine, ovaries, muscle, and pancreas. The overall Klb and FGFR4 distribution in mouse tissues was similar to that of human tissues. However, contrary to the findings in human tissues, no consistent Klb or FGFR4 expression could be detected in mouse pancreas. In addition, a low level of Klb expression was detected in mouse colon, whereas no expression was found in the corresponding human tissues. These differences might be attributable to species- and/or strain-specific tissue distribution. These data indicate that liver is the only mouse organ in which Klb and FGFR4 are highly co-expressed. To determine the FGF19-specific site of action, we compared the levels of c-Fos expression in organs of mice injected with FGF19 with those of mice injected with PBS (controls). We chose to monitor the c-Fos response to FGF19 because c-Fos expression is ubiquitous and its induction is sensitive to FGF19 stimulation. C-Fos expression was 1300-fold higher in the livers of mice injected with FGF19 compared with the livers of mice injected with PBS (Fig. 4E). The FGF19-dependent c-Fos induction was at least 150-fold lower in all other organs tested. The activity of FGF19 in liver was confirmed by a 98% inhibition of CYP7A1 expression (Fig. 4F). These data demonstrate that FGF19 acts specifically in liver, the only mouse organ that expresses high levels of both Klb and FGFR4. In this study we have provided evidence that FGF19 requires KLB for binding to FGFR4, intracellular signaling, and down-stream gene modulation. However, the reason for such a requirement is still unclear. Compared with the paracrine FGF family members, FGF19 has a low heparin-binding affinity that allows it to act in an endocrine fashion without being tethered to the pericellular proteoglycan of the secreting cells (6Inagaki T.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The topology of the FGF19 heparin-binding site prevents FGF19 from forming hydrogen bonds with heparin when FGF19 is bound to its receptor (21Goetz R. Beenken A. Ibrahimi O.A. Kalinina J. Olsen S.K. Eliseenkova A.V. Xu C. Neubert T.A. Zhang F. Linhardt R.J. Yu X. White K.E. Inagaki T. Kliewer S.A. Yamamoto M. Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Kuro O.M. Lanske B. Razzaque M.S. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3417-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Therefore KLB may act as an FGFR4 co-receptor that stabilizes the weak FGF19-FGFR4-heparin interaction. In addition, we have shown that FGFR4 and KLB readily interacted in a heparin- and ligand-independent manner at the cell surface (Fig. 1, C-E). This result contrasts with the heparin- and ligand-dependent complex formation observed with the secreted chimeric FGFR4 and KLB proteins (Fig. 1, A and B). This discrepancy may indicate a role for the KLB and FGFR4 transmembrane domains in the complex formation. The KLB and FGFR4 transmembrane domains could directly interact with each other or promote the interaction of the proteins by tethering them to the cell surface. The KLB-FGFR4 cell surface complex might alter the heparin- and ligand-induced receptor dimerization that was described previously for paracrine FGFs (22Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 23Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A.

However, the absence of FGFR4 expression (Fig. 4D) precludes FGF19 activity in this tissue. Therefore, it is possible that KLB promotes the activity of other endocrine FGF family members with different FGFR binding specificity in adipose tissues. Notably, KLB was recently shown to be required for FGF21 adipose-specific activity (24Ogawa Y. Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M. Kuro-o M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7432-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Because of its low heparin-binding affinity, FGF21 might require KLB to signal through FGFR1 and FGFR2 (21Goetz R. Beenken A. Ibrahimi O.A. Kalinina J. Olsen S.K. Eliseenkova A.V. Xu C. Neubert T.A.

Together, these data demonstrate that FGF19 requires KLB for binding to FGFR4, intracellular signaling, and downstream gene modulation. Most importantly, the requirement for KLB restricts the endocrine activity of FGF19 to tissues that express both FGFR4 and KLB. The liver-specific activity of FGF19 is supported by this molecular mechanism. We are grateful to Pete Haverty for assistance with the preparation of figures.

https://openalex.org/W2164453525,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC), or cyclosome, is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that collaborates with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to assemble polyubiquitin chains on proteins important for cell-cycle progression. It remains unclear how the APC - or many other E3s - promotes the multiple distinct reactions necessary for chain assembly. We addressed this problem by analyzing APC interactions with different E2s. We screened all budding yeast E2s as APC coenzymes in vitro and found that two, Ubc4 and Ubc1, are the key E2 partners for the APC. These proteins display strikingly different but complementary enzymatic behaviors: Ubc4 supports the rapid monoubiquitination of multiple lysines on APC targets, while Ubc1 catalyzes K48-linked polyubiquitin chain assembly on preattached ubiquitins. Mitotic APC function is lost in yeast strains lacking both Ubc1 and Ubc4. E2-25K, a human homolog of Ubc1, also promotes APC-dependent chain extension on preattached ubiquitins. We propose that sequential E2 proteins catalyze K48-linked polyubiquitination and thus proteasomal destruction of APC targets."

To explore whether stimuli that increase [Ca2+]i also trigger vesicular ATP release from astrocytes, we labeled ATP-containing vesicles with the fluorescent dye quinacrine, which exhibited a significant co-localization with atrial natriuretic peptide. The confocal microscopy study revealed that quinacrine-loaded vesicles displayed mainly non-directional spontaneous mobility with relatively short track lengths and small maximal displacements, whereas 4% of vesicles exhibited directional mobility. After ionomycin stimulation only non-directional vesicle mobility could be observed, indicating that an increase in [Ca2+]i attenuated vesicle mobility. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging in combination with epifluorescence showed that a high percentage of fluorescently labeled vesicles underwent fusion with the plasma membrane after stimulation with glutamate or ionomycin and that this event was Ca2+-dependent. This was confirmed by patch-clamp studies on HEK-293T cells transfected with P2X3 receptor, used as sniffers for ATP release from astrocytes. Glutamate stimulation of astrocytes was followed by an increase in the incidence of small transient inward currents in sniffers, reminiscent of postsynaptic quantal events observed at synapses.

In our recent study we have shown that transport of ANP-containing vesicles through the cytoplasm of astrocytes is supported by different types of the cytoskeleton (30Potokar M. Kreft M. Li L.

The aim of the present study was to characterize the nature and behavior of ATP-containing vesicles in astrocytes and to further explore the properties of exocytosis as a potential mechanism of ATP release from astrocytes. To this end, we used several approaches: first, we stained ATP vesicles with quinacrine (14Coco S. Calegari F. Pravettoni E. Pozzi D. Taverna E. Rosa P. Matteoli M. Verderio C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1354-1362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 31Bodin P. Burnstock G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2001; 38: 900-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and examined their subcellular localization with immunocytochemistry. Second, using total internal reflection fluorescence and confocal microscopy, we analyzed vesicle mobility and their fusion with the plasma membrane after various stimulatory challenges. Third, to directly test the properties of ATP release from astrocytes, a sniffer cell approach was used. For this purpose, HEK-293T cells, co-transfected with the purinergic P2X3 receptor and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), were plated onto cultured cortical astrocytes; green fluorescent HEK-293T cells were then patch-clamped to record ATP-mediated membrane currents during stimulation of neighboring astrocytes. Our experimental evidence shows a high degree of co-localization of quinacrine-loaded vesicles and vesicles containing ANP, demonstrating a likely co-storage of ATP and ANP. We report the SNARE-dependent reduction in number of quinacrine-loaded vesicles after stimulation with ionomycin, indicating the involvement of exocytotic cargo release. The mobility of the remaining vesicles, observed in the cytoplasm, significantly decreased after stimulation of cells. Finally, in sniffer engineered HEK-293T cells plated on astrocytes we detected small transient inward currents (STICs), which likely report the quantal release of ATP from astrocytes and are reminiscent of postsynaptically detected ATP-mediated events (26Fabbro A. Skorinkin A. Grandolfo M. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, a sustained release of ATP because of permeation of channels or transporters would result in sustained increase in inward current in HEK-293T cells, whereas transient currents similar to STICs can only be reproduced with very short (10 ms) pulses of ATP application (26Fabbro A. Skorinkin A. Grandolfo M. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The frequency of STICs increased after astrocyte stimulation by glutamate and drastically decreased in the absence of calcium in the extracellular solution. Together, these data demonstrate that various stimuli trigger a Ca2+-dependent, most likely vesicular release of ATP from astrocytes. Primary Rat Cortical and Hippocampal Astrocyte Cultures—Primary cortical astrocyte cultures were prepared from the cerebral cortices of 2-3-day-old rats as described (32Pangršič T. Potokar M.

Briefly, cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, and 25 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2/95% air. When cells reached confluence, they were shaken three times overnight at 200 rpm and, after each shaking, the medium was changed. The cells were then trypsinized. After reaching confluence again, they were subcultured onto 22-mm diameter poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and used in the experiments during the following 3 days. Hippocampi of Wistar rat embryos (E18) were removed and dissociated mechanically in a Ca2+- and Mg2+-free balanced salt solution (CMF-BSS) at pH 7.4, containing 137 mm NaCl, 5.36 mm KCl, 0.27 mm Na2HPO4, 1.1 mm KH2PO4, 6.1 mm glucose. After centrifugation at 1,000 rpm (200 g) for 5 min, the pellet was resuspended in culture medium (pH 7.6) containing Neurobasal medium, penicillin 100 units/ml and streptomycin 100 μg/ml. The cells were plated at a density of 1.5·105 cells/cm2 on MatTek dishes pre-treated with poly-l-lysine. Cultures were maintained in 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C, allowed to grow to confluence and used at 14-21 days in vitro. Medium was changed every 3-4 days. Astrocytes were identified on the basis of their flat morphology and close adhesion to the substrate. Immunocytochemistry—Prior to immunocytochemistry, cortical astrocytes were labeled with quinacrine dihydrochloride (1 μm; 15 min at room temperature). Thereafter, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Nonspecific staining was minimized by incubating cells in blocking buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10% goat serum in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were stained with primary and secondary antibodies, diluted into 3% BSA in PBS and incubated at 37 °C, and then treated with Light Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). A primary antibody against ANP (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and a secondary antibody against rabbit IgG (Alexa Fluor 546; 1:600; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) were used (28Kržan M. Stenovec M. Kreft M. Pangršič T. Grilc S. Haydon P.G. Zorec R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1580-1583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—Images of live cortical astrocytes loaded with quinacrine dihydrochloride for detection of vesicle mobility and images of immunolabeled cells were obtained with an inverted Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Jena, Germany). After incubation in quinacrine solution as described above, cells were rinsed, supplied with extracellular solution and observed with an oil immersion objective 63 ×/NA 1.4. In the study of the mobility of cell vesicles images were recorded every 2 s. For excitation of quinacrine 488 nm line of the Ar-Ion laser was used. The fluorescence signal was band-pass filtered at 505-530 nm. For cell stimulation, 2 μm ionomycin was applied by bath superperfusion. In immunocytochemical studies we used the 543 nm beam of the He-Ne laser to excite Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The emission fluorescence was long-pass filtered at 560 nm. For excitation of quinacrine, the Ar-Ion laser was used, as described above. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy—TIRF-equipped CellR (Olympus Europe, Hamburg, Germany) was used to study vesicles distribution and dynamics near the plasma membrane (33Axelrod D. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 361: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). TIRF microscopy selectively reveals membrane-proximal fluorescent molecules through use of evanescent excitation light that decays exponentially in intensity along the direction perpendicular to the glass/liquid interface to which the cells adhere (33Axelrod D. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 361: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The exponentially decaying excitation light causes fluorescently tagged vesicles to appear progressively brighter as they move toward the interface, while the vesicles located >150-200 nm from the interface are invisible in TIRF. Conversely, the intensity of wide-field epifluorescence image of the same vesicles is insensitive to their sub-micrometer translocations in the vertical direction. The ratio between the vesicle image brightness in TIRF and its epifluorescence brightness (34Kolikova J. Afzalov R. Giniatullina A. Surin A. Giniatullin R. Khiroug L. Brain Cell Biol. 2006; 35: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was used to estimate the percentage of vesicles docked on the plasma membrane under resting conditions. To characterize the time course of stimulus-induced docking of individual quinacrine-loaded vesicles on the basal plasma membrane, time-lapse image series were generated by taking a pair of images (TIRF and epifluorescence) every 1-5 s. Vesicle docking was detected as an increase in its TIRF fluorescence with epifluorescence unchanged. Fusion of a vesicle and release of its content into extracellular space was detected as a signal loss both in TIRF and epifluorescence. Vesicle Tracking and Co-localization Analysis—Vesicle mobility was analyzed with Particle TR software (Celica, Ljubljana, Slovenia) as previously described (35Potokar M. Kreft M. Pangršič T. Zorec R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We calculated the following parameters of vesicle mobility: current time (time from the beginning of single vesicle tracking), step length (displacement of a vesicle in each time interval), track length (the total length of the analyzed vesicle pathway), maximal displacement (a measure of the net translocation of a vesicle) and the directionality index (maximal displacement/total track length) of vesicles as described previously (35Potokar M. Kreft M. Pangršič T. Zorec R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36Wacker I. Kaether C. Kromer A. Migala A. Almers W. Gerdes H.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of vesicle mobility was performed for epochs of 30 s. The analysis of the co-localization degree between fluorescent pixels labeling different vesicles was performed with ColoC software (Celica, Ljubljana, Slovenia). Briefly, the software counts the number of green, red and co-localized pixels in each image. The degree of co-localization used in the analysis was expressed as the degree (%) of co-localized pixels in the cell in comparison to all green pixels in the cell, which are labeling ATP-containing vesicles. Overlaid green and red signals, indicating the co-localization between the ATP and peptide hormones, were observed as a yellow color in the images. Co-cultures of Astrocytes and Transfected HEK-293T Cells—Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared as mentioned above. Astrocytes were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips on the day of HEK-293T cell transfection. HEK-293T cells, obtained from the SISSA cell bank, were maintained in culture using the medium for astrocytes. Co-transfection of HEK-293T cells with plasmids encoding for mutated rat P2X3 receptor (provided by SISSA) and for GFP (EGFP-N1, Clontech, Takara Bio Europe, Saint-Germain-enLaye, France) was performed using the calcium phosphate transfection method (37Fabbretti E. Sokolova E. Masten L. D'Arco M. Fabbro A. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53109-53115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For these experiments, we used the rP2X3 receptor mutated at D266A to exploit the fact that, because this mutant shows very reduced desensitization (37Fabbretti E. Sokolova E. Masten L. D'Arco M. Fabbro A. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53109-53115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it greatly improves the detection of ATP-evoked current responses. HEK-293T cells were trypsinized 24 h after transfection and replated on top of astrocytes attached to coverslips. Apyrase (1 unit/ml) was added to coverslips to prevent excessive stimulation of transfected HEK-293T cells by ambient ATP. Co-cultures were used within the next 2 days after P2X3-expressing HEK-293T cell plating. The successfulness of co-transfection of P2X3 and EGFP was tested by immunofluorescence experiments. Paraformaldehyde-fixed co-trasfected HEK-293T cells were processed with anti-P2X3 receptor antibody (dilution 1:200, Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) and an AlexaFluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (dilution 1:500, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). In addition, cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. If not otherwise mentioned, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Electrophysiological Recordings and Analysis—Coverslips with co-cultures of astrocytes and HEK-293T cells were bathed in extracellular medium containing (in mm): NaCl 152, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 2, Na HEPES 10, d-glucose 10, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Patch-clamp pipettes had a resistance of 2-5 MΩ and were filled with (in mm): CsCl 130, MgCl2 1, HEPES 20, Na2ATP 3, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. All recordings were made at room temperature. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were performed with SWAM IIB (Celica, Ljubljana, Slovenia). Green fluorescent P2X3-expressing HEK-293T cells lying on top of or beside astrocytes were voltage clamped at -60 mV. Whole cell currents were acquired at 10 kHz, filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized by WinWCP software (Strathclyde University, Glasgow, UK). Off-line data analysis was performed using software subroutines written in MATLAB (MathWorks Inc.) with additional digital filtering as required. Slow drifts/fluctuations in the signal were digitally subtracted. We measured peak amplitude, rise time (20-80% of the peak amplitude) and half-decay time (to 50% of the peak amplitude) of transient current events and their apparent inter-event interval. To stimulate ATP release from astrocytes 100-300 μm glutamate was added to the extracellular solution. All data are given as mean ± S.E.; n denotes the number of individual cells assessed in patch-clamp studies or the number of events detected. Statistical differences were determined by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test and considered significant at p < 0.05. Quinacrine Loading into ATP Vesicles in Astrocytes—To visualize ATP-containing vesicles in astrocytes we incubated cultures in 1 μm quinacrine dihydrochloride (14Coco S. Calegari F. Pravettoni E. Pozzi D. Taverna E. Rosa P. Matteoli M. Verderio C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1354-1362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 31Bodin P. Burnstock G. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2001; 38: 900-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, displaying one section of a rat astrocyte, shows the presence of large numbers of ATP vesicles (∼80 vesicles/cell), which are randomly distributed over the cell profile. To identify the nature of ATP-containing vesicles, treated cells were immunolabeled with antibodies against ANP (Fig. 1). The double staining revealed a high degree of co-localization between two dyes (green for quinacrine, see Fig. 1A, and red for anti-ANP, see Fig. 1B), observed as yellow fluorescence (Fig. 1C). The average degree of quinacrine and ANP co-localization between containing vesicles, expressed as the ratio between all co-localized pixels and all green pixels in the cell, was 39.48 ± 6.59% (n = 12; n represents the number of analyzed cells). These results show that ATP was substantially co-stored in peptidergic vesicles with ANP in astrocytes. The Mobility of Quinacrine-loaded Vesicles Decreased after Stimulation—The total number of tracked quinacrine-stained vesicles was 817 in non-stimulated cells (n = 10), while in ionomycin-stimulated (2 μm, 1 min) cells (n = 6) only 109 vesicles could be tracked after bath application of the Ca2+ ionophore. When ionomycin was omitted from the bath, the total image fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S1A, filled bars) and the number of quinacrine-stained vesicles per cell did not change significantly over time (supplemental Fig. S1B, filled bars). On the contrary, when cells were stimulated by 2 μm ionomycin, the total image fluorescence decreased from 100% to 93.8 ± 2.3% (mean ± S.E., n = 6) within 1 min (supplemental Fig. S1, open bars) and the number of quinacrine-stained vesicles decreased from 110 ± 13 to 93 ± 10 vesicles per cell (from 100% to 84.6 ± 3.0%) (p < 0.05, paired Student's t test). Following 2 min of incubation in the presence of ionomycin, the total image fluorescence decreased to 87.4 ± 3.7% and the number of quinacrine-stained vesicles decreased to 84 ± 10 vesicles per cell (the relative number of vesicles was reduced to 76.6 ± 5.2%), (supplemental Fig. S1, open bars), which is consistent with the Ca2+-dependent, exocytotic fluorescent cargo release from quinacrine-stained vesicles in stimulated astrocytes. To further test that these results reflect exocytotic cargo release from quinacrine-stained vesicles as considered previously (10Pascual O. Casper K.B. Kubera C. Zhang J. Revilla-Sanchez R. Sul J.-Y. Takano H. Moss S.J. McCarthy K. Haydon P.G. Science. 2005; 310: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 14Coco S. Calegari F. Pravettoni E. Pozzi D. Taverna E. Rosa P. Matteoli M. Verderio C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1354-1362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), astrocytes were transfected with a construct to express the dominant-negative SNARE domain peptide, which blocks the formation of the SNARE complex (24Zhang Q. Pangršič T. Kreft M. Kržan M. Li N. Sul J.Y. Halassa M. Van Bockstaele E. Zorec R. Haydon P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12724-12733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Transfected cells displaying cytosolic EGFP fluorescence were stained with quinacrine and stimulated by 2 μm ionomycin to trigger Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. In transfected cells, the number of quinacrine-stained vesicles per cell was not reduced significantly (p > 0.05, paired Student's t test) following ionomycin stimulation (supplemental Fig. S1B, gray bars) clearly indicating that the decrease in quinacrine-stained vesicles is a SNARE-dependent process. To estimate the mobility these vesicles were tracked for 30 s in resting conditions and from 30 to 60 s after the addition of 2 μm ionomycin. Vesicles in resting conditions predominantly displayed non-directional mobility as only a few vesicles had almost rectilinear directional mobility (Fig. 2A). Directional and non-directional mobility was determined as described (35Potokar M. Kreft M. Pangršič T. Zorec R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Ionomycin application greatly affected both types of vesicle mobility. In non-stimulated cells, the maximal displacement of directional vesicles (nd) was 2.49 ± 0.38 μm (nd = 35) and the track length was 3.46 ± 0.37 μm. Following ionomycin application, none of tracked vesicles displayed directional mobility within 30-60 s after stimulation (note the absence of rectilinear tracks in Fig. 2B). However, ionomycin also significantly affected the mobility of non-directional vesicles. The maximal displacement of non-directional vesicles was significantly reduced from 0.37 ± 0.01 μm (nn = 782); (n represents the number of vesicles) in non-stimulated cells to 0.30 ± 0.01 μm in ionomycin-stimulated cells, (n = 109; p < 0.001). Similarly, the mean vesicle track length was significantly shorter in stimulated (1.14 ± 0.04 μm; n = 109) than in non-stimulated cells (1.30 ± 0.02 μm; p < 0.001). Directionality index (see “Experimental Procedures”) decreased from 0.66 ± 0.03 (nd) and 0.34 ± 0.001 (nn) to 0.28 ± 0.001 in stimulated cells. Following the elevation of free cytosolic [Ca2+] by ionomycin, vesicles are like"

In the present study, we determined the mechanism by which FASN and acetyl-CoA carboxylase α (ACCα) could be induced by HER2 overexpression. SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells, breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2, expressed higher levels of FASN and ACCα compared with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in which HER2 expression is low. The induction of FASN and ACCα in BT474 cells were not mediated by the activation of SREBP-1. Exogenous HER2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells induced the expression of FASN and ACCα, and the HER2-mediated increase in ACCα and FASN was inhibited by both LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, and rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor. In addition, the activation of mTOR by the overexpression of RHEB in MDA-MB-231 cells increased the synthetic rates of both FASN and ACCα. On the other hand, FASN and ACCα were reduced in BT-474 cells by a blockade of the mTOR signaling pathway. These changes observed in their protein levels were not accompanied by changes in their mRNA levels. The 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of both FASN and ACCα mRNAs were involved in selective translational induction that was mediated by mTOR signal transduction. These results strongly suggest that the major mechanism of HER2-mediated induction of FASN and ACCα in the breast cancer cells used in this study is translational regulation primarily through the mTOR signaling pathway.

FASN, a lipogenic enzyme, catalyzes the biosynthesis of palmitic acid that is used for the synthesis of triacylglycerol as a storage fuel molecule as well as membrane lipids including phospholipids and sphingolipids (4Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev. Biochemistry. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In breast cancer cells, the expression of FASN is closely related to the aggressiveness of cancers as well as to the development, maintenance, and cell cycle progression of human cancers (5Jensen V. Ladekarl M. Holm-Nielsen P. Melsen F. Soerensen F.B. J. Pathol. 1995; 176: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Kuhajda F.P. Piantadosi S. Pasternack G.R. N. Engl. J.

Breast cancer cells that overexpress FASN undergo apoptosis when treated with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against FASN or FASN inhibitors, such as C75 and cerulenin (8Menendez J.A. Mehmi I. Atlas E. Colomer R. Lupu R. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 591-608PubMed Google Scholar, 9Menendez J.A. Mehmi I. Verma V.A. Teng P.K. Lupu R. Mol.

A. 2004; 101: 10715-10720Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, the activities of lipogenic enzymes, including FASN, are tightly regulated by nutritional and hormonal parameters at the transcription level. Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2) are the major transcription factors that mediate this regulation (12Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar). SREBPs reside in endoplasmic reticulum membranes as inactive precursors. To become active, the NH2-terminal segments of SREBPs are released from the endoplasmic reticulum by proteolytic cleavage and enter the nucleus where they activate their target genes. SREBP-1 preferentially activates the genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, whereas SREBP-2 preferentially activates the genes involved in cholesterol synthesis. Activation of SREBPs has been suggested as one of the major mechanisms by which the induction of FASN in breast cancer cells occurs (13Menendez J.A. Colomer R. Lupu R. Med. Hypotheses. 2005; 64: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). SREBP-1-mediated induction of the expression of FASN was shown in MCF10a epithelial cells transformed by H-ras; SREBP-1 was activated by mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways (14Yang Y.A.

Progestin also can induce FASN expression in T47D breast cancer cells through SREBP-1 activation (16Martel P.M. Bingham C.M. McGraw C.J. Baker C.L. Morganelli P.M. Meng M.L. Armstrong J.M.

For the overexpression of FASN in breast cancer cell lines, human epithelial growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) was reported to play an important role (8Menendez J.A. Mehmi I. Atlas E. Colomer R. Lupu R. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 591-608PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kumar-Sinha C. Ignatoski K.W. Lippman M.E. Ethier S.P. Chinnaiyan A.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 132-139PubMed Google Scholar). HER2 belongs to the type I family of growth factor receptors in which four structurally related proteins are included: HER1 (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3), and HER4 (ErbB4). HER2 forms a heterodimer with other HER family members to activate its intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity, triggering a cascade of signal transduction events that result in cellular proliferation (18Alimandi M.

It was reported that HER2 gene amplification and/or protein overexpression occurs in 14–30% of all breast cancer cases (21Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar, 22Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Press M.F.

Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, Herceptin, a monoclonal antibody that blocks signals transduced by HER2, has been shown to augment the effects of chemotherapeutic agents in metastatic breast cancers (25Slamon D.J. Leyland-Jones B. Shak S. Fuchs H. Paton V. Bajamonde A. Fleming T. Eiermann W. Wolter J. Pegram M. Baselga J. Norton L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (9491) Google Scholar). One of the suggested mechanisms that correlates FASN overexpression with HER2 is that aberrant PI3K transduction cascades by HER2 drive the constitutive activation of SREBP-1c, resulting in transcriptional induction of the FASN gene (13Menendez J.A. Colomer R. Lupu R. Med. Hypotheses. 2005; 64: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Yang Y.A. Morin P.J. Han W.F. Chen T. Bornman D.M. Gabrielson E.W. Pizer E.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 282: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A number of growth factors, hormones, and cytokines activate PI3K, which in turn activates Akt. Activated Akt phosphorylates tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2), then represses the GTPase-activating protein activity of TSC1/TSC2 on RHEB, the major regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The mTOR protein, one of the downstream effectors of PI3K, is a Ser/Thr kinase that controls cell growth and proliferation by the regulation of protein synthesis (26Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar, 27Harris T.E. Jr. Lawrence J.C. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: re15PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of either TSC1 or TSC2, RHEB-GTP levels are high, which leads to the constitutive activation of the mTOR-raptor signaling pathway. The activation of mTOR leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation of eIF4E-binding protein, resulting in the derepression of translation. Another target of mTOR is the 70-kDa subunit of S6 kinase 1 that controls protein synthesis in response to various hormones, mitogens, and nutrients (28Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 29Proud C.G. Wang X. Patel J.V. Campbell L.E. Kleijn M. Li W. Browne G.J. Biochem. Soc.

It was reported that mTOR, which is activated by HER2 overexpression, plays a role in the proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo (31Zhou X. Tan M. Stone Hawthorne V. Klos K.S. Lan K.H. Yang Y. Yang W. Smith T.L. Shi D. Yu D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 6779-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that mTOR inhibition sensitizes certain resistant cancer cells to endocrine therapy with tamoxifen (32deGraffenried L.A. Friedrichs W.E. Russell D.H. Donzis E.J. Middleton A.K. Silva J.M. Roth R.A. Hidalgo M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 8059-8067Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 33Johnston S.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 889s-899PubMed Google Scholar) and certain chemotherapeutic drugs, such as paclitaxel, and carboplatin, thus suggesting that the mTOR signaling pathway is a candidate molecular target for breast cancer treatment (34Mondesire W.H. Jian W. Zhang H. Ensor J. Hung M.C. Mills G.B. Meric-Bernstam F. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 7031-7042Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Although lipogenesis has proven to be an important process for the survival and proliferation of breast cancer cells, little is known about the mechanisms by which HER2 mediates the regulation of lipogenic enzymes. In the present study, we show that the expression of two lipogenic enzymes, FASN and ACCα, is increased by HER2 overexpression, and that the activation of mTOR by HER2 plays an important role in their overexpression through the selective translational activation of their mRNAs. It is suggested that the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of both FASN and ACCα mRNAs contribute to the increase in the translational efficiency of their mRNAs by mTOR. Cell Culture—Human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, BT-474, and SK-BR-3, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in the respective media (Invitrogen) as recommended by the ATCC at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Preparation of Recombinant Adenovirus and Viral Transfection—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing HER2 (AdHER2) and RHEB (AdRHEB) were constructed using the AdEasy adenoviral vector system vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cDNAs encoding HER2 and RHEB were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pShuttle-CMV plasmid. The recombinant shuttle vector constructs and pAdEasy-1 vector were co-transformed into BJ5183 Escherichia coli by electroporation. The positive recombinant adenovirus plasmids were identified by restriction digestion. Five micrograms of the recombinant adenovirus plasmids were linearized by digestion with PacI, then transfected into HEK-293A cells using Lipofectamine and the PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). The adenoviruses were amplified in 293A cells, and infective viruses were isolated using CsCl2 ultracentrifugation. The infective recombinant adenoviruses were desalted and the viral titers were determined by plaque-forming assay using an agarose overlay in HEK-293A cells. MDA-MB-231 and BT-474 cells were transduced with recombinant adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 in serum-free media at 37 °C. Culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics 2 h after transduction. After an overnight incubation, cells were treated with LY294002 (Alexis, San Diego, CA), Herceptin (a generous gift from Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), or rapamycin (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) for 24 h. The cells were harvested at 48 h after viral transduction and processed for either immunoblot analysis or RNA isolation. A replicon-defective adenoviral vector expressing green fluorescence protein (AdGFP) was used as a control. Immunoblot Analyses—The cells treated as indicated in the figure legends were harvested and lysed in 2× SDS loading buffer, then briefly sonicated. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk, and probed with primary antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. The following antibodies were used: polyclonal antibodies against rat ACCα from Genepia (Seoul, Korea); polyclonal antibodies against S6 protein, phospho-S6 protein, mTOR, phospho-mTOR, and RHEB from Cell Signaling Technology; polyclonal antibodies against HER2 from Oncogene (San Diego, CA); and monoclonal antibodies against α-tubulin from Calbiochem. Polyclonal antibodies against FASN and SREBP-1 were described previously (35Kim K.S. Park S.W. Kim Y.S. Yonsei Med. J. 1992; 33: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 36Oh S.Y. Park S.K.

Antibodies against human SREBP-2, and bovine low density lipoprotein receptor were kindly provided by Jay Horton (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate System (Pierce). siRNA Experiment—siRNA oligonucleotides for mTOR were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). A scrambled siRNA (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) was used as a control. Transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 100 pmol of siRNA and 6 μl of FuGENE 6 were mixed in 100 μl of serumfree media. After 30 min of incubation, the siRNA-FuGENE 6 mixture was added to the cultured cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, lysates were prepared and immunoblot analyses were performed. Cell Viability Assay—Cells (3 × 103 cells/well) were placed in a 96-well culture plate on day 0. On day 1, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 μg/ml cerulenin (Sigma) solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide. On day 2, cell viability was determined using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Northern Blot Analysis and Real-time (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern blot hybridization, 20 μg of total RNA were denatured and subjected to electrophoresis on denaturing agarose gels containing formaldehyde. RNA was then transferred to nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), UV cross-linked, and hybridized with SREBP-1, ACLY, ACCα, FASN, and β-actin cDNAs as probes. The probes were labeled using Rediprime II random primer labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) and [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For quantitative RT-PCR, cDNAs were synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) and SuperScript reverse transcriptase II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resulting cDNA was subsequently mixed with 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and various sets of gene-specific primers and then subjected to RT-PCR quantification using the ABI PR PRISM 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of the primers used were as follows: FASN,5′ primer, 5′-TCGTGGGCTACAGCATGGT, and 3′ primer, 5′-GCCCTCTGAAGTCGAAGAAGAA-3′; ACCα,5′ primer, 5′-CTGTAGAAACCCGGACAGTAGAAC-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-GGTCAGCATACATCTCCATGTG-3′; ACLY,5′ primer, 5′-TGCTCGATTATGCACTGGAAGT-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-ATGAACCCCATACTCCTTCCCAG-3′; glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5′ primer, 5′-CCCCTTCATTGACCTCAACTAC-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-GAGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAAG-3′. All reactions were performed in triplicate. The relative amounts of the RNAs were calculated by using the comparative CT method. As an invariant control, GAPDH mRNA was used. Measurement of RHEB-induced Translational Activation of FASN and ACCα—MDA-MB-231 cells (8 × 105 cells/10-cm dish) were plated on day 0. On day 1, the cells were transduced with either AdGFP or AdRHEB at a multiplicity of infection of 100 as described above. Twenty-four hours after transduction, the medium was replaced with methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) for 1 h. Rates of protein synthesis were measured by a pulse labeling experiment; [35S]Met-Cys (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the medium at a final concentration of 0.3 mCi/ml. Cells were incubated for 0, 1, 2, and 4 h. After incubation, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with 500 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) on ice. Protein degradation was measured by pulse-chase assay; the cells were rinsed after a 4-h pulse labeling, incubated in medium containing 2 mml-methionine and 20 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0, 1, 2, and 4 h, and then harvested in lysis buffer. The cell lysates were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and precleared by mixing with 50 μlof protein A-agarose (50% slurry), followed by incubation for 2 h on a rotating device at 4 °C. After removal of protein A-agarose by centrifugation, the indicated antibodies were added to the cleared cell lysates and incubated overnight on a rotating device at 4 °C. After the addition of 50 μl of protein A-agarose, the mixture was incubated for 2 h. The protein A-agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.05% (w/v) deoxycholate, and washed once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.05% (w/v) deoxycholate. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the protein A-agarose by boiling for 5 min with 1× SDS loading buffer, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were soaked in 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 10 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Generation of Promoter-Reporter Constructs and Transient Transfection Assay—To evaluate the regulatory roles of the UTRs of ACCα, FASN, and ACLY mRNAs on gene expression, two ACCα 5′-UTRs, designated Ex1 (599 bp) and Ex2 (161 bp), the 5′-UTR of FASN (100 bp), and the 5′-UTR of ACLY (101 bp) were amplified from the cDNA prepared using total RNA isolated from BT-474 cells. The amplified PCR fragments were inserted into the HindIII/NcoI sites of the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega), resulting in constructs harboring the amplified 5′-UTR fragments immediately upstream of the open reading frame of the firefly luciferase gene in the pGL3 promoter. The 3′-UTR sequences of ACCα, FASN, and ACLY were obtained by digesting human ACCα cDNA image clone 3874305 with XhoI/BamHI, human FASN cDNA image clone 6172538 with NcoI/XhoI, and the human ACLY cDNA image clone 2959339 with NdeI/XhoI, respectively. The digested fragments with sizes of 2.4, 1, and 1 kb for ACCα, FASN, and ACLY, respectively, were subcloned into the XbaI site of the pGL3 promoter vector, resulting in constructs harboring the 3′-UTR fragments downstream of the firefly luciferase gene. To construct the pGL3 promoter containing both the 5′- and 3′-UTRs, the amplified 5′-UTR fragments were inserted upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the pGL3 promoter constructs containing the 3′-UTRs of ACCα, FASN, and ACLY downstream of the luciferase gene. After transient transfection of these constructs into MDA-MB-231 cells, both the luciferase assay and PCR were performed to determine the role of the UTR sequences in gene expression under conditions of RHEB overexpression. The cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates on day 0. On day 1, the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine and the PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol with a minor modification for the simultaneous transduction with AdRHEB. Plasmid DNA (0.6 μg) was mixed with Lipofectamine and the PLUS reagent in serum-free media. While the complexes were forming, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with 1 ml of serum-free media containing a multiplicity of infection of 100 of either AdGFP or AdRHEB. After 15 min, the Lipofectamine-DNA complexes were added to the medium. After a 3-h transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For BT-474 cells, the same transfection procedures were performed except for transduction with adenoviruses. On day 2, the cells were treated with rapamycin for 24 h. On day 3, the cells were harvested and lysed with 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The luciferase activity assay was performed using 5 μl of the cell extract and 45 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Each transfection experiment was performed in triplicate, and mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments were calculated. For quantitative analysis of the luciferase mRNA in the transfected cells, poly(A)-rich RNAs were isolated using the PolyATtract mRNA isolation system IV (Promega) from total RNA, and treated with RNase-free DNase (Ambion) to remove the transfected DNA. PCR for the luciferase mRNA was performed using the luciferase primer set: 5′ primer, 5′-AGCGACCAACGCCTTGATT-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-ACTTCAGGCGGTCAACGATG-3′. To verify the complete removal of transfected DNA, amplification of the SV40 promoter region of the reporter constructs was performed as a negative control with the following primers: 5′ primer, 5′-CTAGCAAAATAGGCTGTCCCC-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTC C-3′. FASN Expression Is Closely Linked to HER2 Expression in Breast Cancer Cell Lines—Increased expression of FASN has previously been demonstrated in breast and ovarian cancer cells (5Jensen V.

FASN and HER2 expression levels were evaluated by immunoblot analysis in four human breast cancer cell lines. HER2 was not detected in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, whereas overexpression of HER2 was shown in BT-474 and SK-BR-3 cells (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previous reports, cells that overexpress HER2 showed higher expression levels of FASN (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4) than cells lacking detectable levels of HER2. To determine whether expression of FASN is important for cell growth and survival in these cells, cells were treated with cerulenin (10 μg/ml) for 24 h and viable cells were assayed. Cerulenin, a natural product derived from Cephalosporium caerulens, is a suicide inhibitor that binds irreversibly to the catalytic site of the β-ketoacyl synthase domain of multifunctional FASN (39D'Agnolo G. Rosenfeld I.S. Awaya J. Omura S. Vagelos P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 326: 155-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 40Vance D. Goldberg I. Mitsuhashi O. Bloch K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). BT-474 and SK-BR-3 cells that overexpress FASN and HER2 showed higher susceptibility to cerulenin than did MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells, resulting in lower cell viability (Fig. 1B). These results suggest a strong association between FASN expression and HER2; the increased expression of FASN might be an important factor for cell growth and survival in breast cancer cells that overexpress HER2. SREBP-1 Is Not the Major Regulator for the Expression of Lipogenic Enzymes in Breast Cancer Cells—To study the role of SREBP-1 on HER2-related increases in FASN, we compared the relative amounts of FASN, ACCα, ACLY, and SREBP-1 in BT-474 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2A). Whereas certain studies have reported that SREBP-1c is the mediator that induces the transcription of FASN in cancer cells (3Menendez J.A. Lupu R. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2006; 9: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 41Swinnen J.V. Brusselmans K. Verhoeven G. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2006; 9: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), the amounts of the precursor form of SREBP-1 were very similar in both cell lines. The amount of the nuclear form of SREBP-1, which has transcriptional activity, was significantly lower in BT-474 compared with MDA-MB-231 cells. However, the expression levels of ACCα and FASN were significantly increased in BT-474 cells compared w"
https://openalex.org/W2157475463,"Treatment of emotional disorders involves the promotion of extinction processes, which are defined as the learned reduction of fear. The molecular mechanisms underlying extinction have only begun to be elucidated. By employing genetic and pharmacological approaches in mice, we show here that extinction requires downregulation of Rac-1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), and upregulation of p21 activated kinase-1 (PAK-1) activity. This is physiologically achieved by a Rac-1-dependent relocation of the Cdk5 activator p35 from the membrane to the cytosol and dissociation of p35 from PAK-1. Moreover, our data suggest that Cdk5/p35 activity prevents extinction in part by inhibition of PAK-1 activity in a Rac-1-dependent manner. We propose that extinction of contextual fear is regulated by counteracting components of a molecular pathway involving Rac-1, Cdk5 and PAK-1. Our data suggest that this pathway could provide a suitable target for therapeutic treatment of emotional disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2101116053,"Structural studies of the Bacillus stearothermophilus PcrA protein along with biochemical studies of the single-stranded (ss) DNA translocation activity of PcrA monomers have led to the suggestion that a PcrA monomer possesses processive helicase activity in vitro. Yet definitive studies testing whether the PcrA monomer possesses processive helicase activity have not been performed. Here we show, using single turnover kinetic methods, that monomers of PcrA are able to translocate along ssDNA, in the 3′ to 5′ direction, rapidly and processively, whereas these same monomers display no detectable helicase activity under the same solution conditions in vitro. The PcrA monomer ssDNA translocation activity, although necessary, is not sufficient for processive helicase activity, and thus the translocase and helicase activities of PcrA are separable. These results also suggest that the helicase activity of PcrA needs to be activated either by self-assembly or through interactions with accessory proteins. This same behavior is displayed by both the Escherichia coli Rep and UvrD monomers. Hence, all three of these SF1 enzymes are ssDNA translocases as monomers but do not display processive helicase activity in vitro unless activated. The fact that the translocase and helicase activities are separable suggests that each activity may be used for different functions in vivo.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4154-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), may be dependent only on the ability of these enzymes to translocate along ssDNA rather than on helicase activity. DNA helicases have been grouped into families and superfamilies defined by conserved amino acid sequence motifs (17Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). These enzymes can also be divided into two distinct structural classes, with one class functioning as toroidal or ring-like hexamers (4Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). By far, the largest number of helicases and putative helicases belong to the nonhexameric SF1 or SF2 superfamilies (17Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). single-stranded double-stranded nonlinear least squares SF1 enzymes have often been considered to be monomeric helicases (18Soultanas P. Wigley D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 47-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Soultanas P. Wigley D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Yet direct experimental tests of whether a monomeric protein has helicase activity have been performed for only a few enzymes. The most direct experimental approach to address the question of what oligomeric form of the enzyme is needed for helicase activity requires examination of the DNA unwinding kinetics under single turnover conditions, such that only a single round of DNA binding is allowed. In such an experiment, the DNA substrate is prebound with enzyme under conditions such that the oligomeric form of the enzyme is known (e.g. a monomer), and the reaction is started by the addition of nucleoside triphosphate (e.g. ATP) along with a “trap” for free enzyme (20Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 21Lucius A.L. Maluf N.K. Fischer C.J. Lohman T.M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2224-2239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Any DNA unwinding that is observed in such a single turnover experiment must be catalyzed by the form of the enzyme that was prebound to the DNA because the trap prevents additional enzyme from binding to the DNA. In contrast, multiple turnover DNA unwinding experiments have been the most common method used to examine helicase activity. Such multiple turnover kinetics experiments cannot provide an unambiguous answer to this question because enzyme dissociation and reassociation can occur during the reaction, and thus the oligomeric state of the enzyme involved in the unwinding process is not known with certainty and even can change during the multiple turnover reaction. Using such single turnover DNA unwinding experiments, it has been shown that the SF1 enzymes E. coli Rep (22Cheng W. Hsieh J. Brendza K.M. Lohman T.M. J. Mol.

Yet with the exception of the Tra I helicase, the SF1 and SF2 helicases alone generally unwind DNA with low processivity in vitro. On the other hand, in a complex with accessory proteins, the processivity of some SF1 enzymes can be increased dramatically. For example, E. coli RecB in complex with RecC is a highly processive SF1 helicase (30Bianco P.R. Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Yeh Y. Kowalczykowski S.C. Baskin R.J.

Interestingly, removal of a subdomain (subdomain 2B) from the E. coli Rep protein activates the helicase activity of the monomer, indicating that the 2B subdomain is autoinhibitory for Rep monomer helicase activity (23Brendza K.M. Cheng W. Fischer C.J. Chesnik M.A. Niedziela-Majka A. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10076-10081Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The hepatitis C NS3 SF2 enzyme also appears to require dimerization to unwind RNA in vitro (37Serebrov V. Pyle A.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Hence, translocation and helicase activities for some SF1 and SF2 enzymes are separable in that the different activities require different oligomeric forms of the protein (7Fischer C.J. Maluf N.K.

Bacillus stearothermophilus PcrA is an SF1 helicase with a monomeric structure (41Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) that is very similar to the monomer structures of both E. coli Rep (42Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and E. coli UvrD (43Lee J.Y. Yang W. Cell. 2006; 127: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Based on structural and biochemical studies of the B. stearothermophilus PcrA protein, it has been proposed that a PcrA monomer is the active form of the helicase in vitro (18Soultanas P. Wigley D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 47-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and a monomeric inchworm model has been proposed for how a monomer of PcrA might unwind DNA (18Soultanas P. Wigley D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 47-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Yet the suggestion that a monomer is the active form of the PcrA helicase in vitro is based on three pieces of circumstantial evidence. The first is that only a PcrA monomer is observed in crystal structures of PcrA bound to a 3′-ss/dsDNA junction (10-bp DNA duplex with a 7-nucleotide 3′ ssDNA flanking region) (44Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The second is that a PcrA monomer possesses the ability to translocate processively with 3′ to 5′ directionality along ssDNA (5Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The third is that only PcrA monomers are observed in the absence of DNA when examined by gel filtration at high salt concentrations (200 mm NaCl) (45Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2686-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Based on these results it has been assumed that a PcrA monomer must also be responsible for helicase activity in vitro. Yet definitive tests using single turnover experiments of whether B. stearothermophilus PcrA monomers possess processive helicase activity in vitro have not been reported. In this report we examine the ssDNA translocation and helicase activities of the B. stearothermophilus PcrA monomer using single turnover kinetic approaches. These studies demonstrate that although PcrA monomers possess robust directional (3′ to 5′) ssDNA translocation activity, in agreement with previous studies (5Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), PcrA monomers are unable to unwind DNA duplexes as short as 18 base pairs. Hence, just like Rep and UvrD monomers, PcrA monomers are very good ssDNA translocases, yet are ineffective as helicases in vitro. Buffers and Miscellaneous Stocks—Buffers were made with reagent grade chemicals using distilled water that was further deionized using a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Buffer A is 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA. Storage Buffer is 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 200 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercapthoethanol. Heparin buffer is 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2. ssDNA buffer is 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 25 °C) and 50 mm NaCl. Buffer H is 53 mm Tris (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 151 mm NaCl, 3.2 mm MgCl2, 1.4% (v/v) glycerol. Buffer L is 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 4 mm dithiothreitol. Buffer T is 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 4 mm dithiothreitol. Spectrophotometric grade glycerol (Aldrich) was used for these buffers. TBE buffer is 89 mm Tris-base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA-Na3 (pH 8.3 at 25 °C). ATP (Sigma-Aldrich) stock solutions were prepared in 50 mm NaOH (pH 7.5), and 500-μl aliquots were stored at -20 °C. ATP concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient (259 nm) of 15.4 × 103 m-1 cm-1. Heparin (sodium salt) (Sigma-Aldrich; catalog number H-3393) stocks were dialyzed versus Heparin buffer at 4 °C, and the concentrations were determined as described (46Mascotti D.P. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2908-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). PcrA Purification—B. stearothermophilus PcrA was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, from plasmid pET-22b-pcrA, containing the wild type PcrA gene, kindly provided by P. Soultanas (University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK) and purified from 2 liters of culture, essentially as described (45Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2686-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 47Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B.

All of the purification steps were performed at 4 °C with some modifications as follows. Protein eluted from the 40-ml Heparin Poros column (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was loaded onto a 40-ml High Q Poros column (Applied Biosystems) equilibrated with buffer A plus 0.1 m NaCl. The protein sample was diluted with buffer A as it was being loaded using the gradient mixer of the AKTA Purifier (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) such that the resulting conductivity of the diluted protein sample was no higher than that of the equilibration buffer. This was necessary to avoid precipitation of the PcrA. The High Q Poros column was washed with buffer A plus 0.1 m NaCl until the absorbance (280 nm) returned to baseline and the column was eluted with a 360-ml linear NaCl gradient (0.1–1 m NaCl) in buffer A (8 ml/min collecting 5-ml fractions). PcrA elutes at ∼180 mm NaCl. Fractions containing PcrA were pooled and loaded onto a ssDNA cellulose column (50 ml) equilibrated with buffer A plus 0.1 m NaCl by mixing directly with buffer A during loading as described above so that the conductivity was no higher than that of the equilibration buffer. The column was washed with buffer A plus 0.1 m NaCl and eluted with a 350-ml linear gradient (0.1–1 m NaCl) in buffer A (2.5 ml/min collecting 4-ml fractions). PcrA elutes at ∼700 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were pooled, and protein was precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 at 25 °C. The ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of buffer A plus 0.2 m NaCl, clarified by 30 min of centrifugation at 18,000 rpm, and applied (0.1 ml/min) to a 125-ml Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A plus 0.2 m NaCl. PcrA protein was dialyzed against Storage Buffer, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. PcrA was determined to be >98% pure based on Coomassie Blue staining of serial dilutions run on an SDS-PAGE gel. PcrA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically in 6 m guanidinium hydroxychloride, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5 at 25 °C) using ϵ280 = 7.183 × 104 m-1 cm-1 (0.87 ml mg-1 cm-1), calculated from its amino acid sequence (49Lohman T.M.

The final yield was 0.5–1 mg of PcrA/g of E. coli cell paste. DNA—Unlabeled and Cy3-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized and purified as described (52Wong I. Chao K.L. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7596-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6032-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and dialyzed versus 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and stored at -20 °C. Oligodeoxynucleotide concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically after digestion to a mixture of mononucleotides with snake venom phosphodiesterase I as described (7Fischer C.J. Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1287-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 54Holbrook J.A. Capp M.W. Saecker R.M. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8409-8422Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). DNA unwinding substrates (3′-dTn-18bp) consisted of an 18-bp duplex region possessing a 3′ ssDNA tail composed of n deoxythymidylates (dTn). The sequence of the top strand (the strand without the 3′ ssDNA tail) was 5′-GCCTCGCTGCCGTCGCCA-3′. Oligodeoxynucleotides were radiolabeled with 32P at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (U.S. Biochemical Corp, Cleveland, OH), and purified as described (52Wong I. Chao K.L. Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7596-7610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The duplex DNA was formed by annealing radiolabeled top strand (∼600 nm) with 1.25-fold molar excess of unlabeled complementary bottom strand in ssDNA buffer by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and slow cooling to room temperature over a period of 2 h. Duplex DNA formation was confirmed by native PAGE on 10% acrylamide gel in TBE buffer. Poly(dT) (Midland Certified Reagents, Inc., Midland, TX) was fractionated using size exclusion chromatography to obtain a high molecular weight fraction (average length, 3.5–16 kb) as described (7Fischer C.J. Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1287-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and was stored at -20 °C after dialysis versus ssDNA buffer. ssDNA Translocation Kinetics—PcrA monomer translocation along ssDNA was examined in both Buffer L at 25 °C and Buffer H at 20 °C as indicated using an SX18MV stopped flow instrument (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK) under single turnover (single round) conditions (no rebinding of dissociated PcrA to ssDNA) by monitoring the arrival of PcrA at the 5′ end of the DNA using 5′-Cy3-(dT)L as described (7Fischer C.J. Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1287-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). PcrA was preincubated with ssDNA in the appropriate buffer (Buffer H or Buffer L) in one syringe, and the reactions were initiated by mixing in a 1:1 volume ratio with the same buffer containing ATP and heparin. All of the concentrations given are the final concentrations after mixing in the stopped flow. For experiments performed in Buffer L, the final solution conditions were: 40 nm PcrA monomer, 120 nm ssDNA, 2.5 mm ATP, 4 mg/ml heparin at 25 °C. For experiments performed in Buffer H, the final solution conditions were: 20 nm PcrA monomer, 100 nm ssDNA, 0.5 mm ATP, 4 mg/ml heparin at 20 °C. Control experiments show that when PcrA in one syringe is rapidly mixed with ssDNA and heparin in the other syringe, under identical solution conditions and concentrations, no translocation is observed, indicating that all of the free PcrA is trapped by the heparin. Multiple time courses for PcrA translocation determined for a series of DNA lengths with 5′-Cy3-(dT)L were analyzed globally by nonlinear least squares (NLLS) analysis using Equation 1(schemes 1 and 2) to obtain estimates of the kinetic parameters as described (7Fischer C.J. Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1287-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). f(t)=A1+nrL-11s+kend×1+ktrs+kd1-kts+kt+kdn(Eq. 1) . In Equation 1, (L-1) is the inverse Laplace transform operator; s is the Laplace variable; A is the signal associated with protein initially bound to ssDNA; kt is the translocation rate constant; n is the maximum number of steps required for PcrA to translocate from the 3′ end to the 5′ end of a ssDNA of length L, and taking m nucleotides per kinetic step, r is the ratio of the probability of PcrA binding to any position on the DNA other than the 5′ end to the probability of protein binding to the 5′ end. The rate constants, kd and kend, are for PcrA dissociation from the internal sites and the 5′ end of DNA, respectively. In this analysis, kt, r and kend were floated as global parameters (i.e. constrained to be the same for all ssDNA lengths), whereas kd was constrained to the value determined independently by monitoring dissociation from poly(dT) as described (7Fischer C.J. Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1287-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the NLLS analysis, the parameters A and n were allowed to float for each ssDNA length. The uncertainties in the fitted parameters (68% confidence limits) were determined by performing a 100 cycle Monte Carlo (55Straume M. Johnson M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) simulation routine in Conlin (56Williams D.J. Hall K.B. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 321: 330-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The maximum number of translocation steps, n, for a ssDNA of length, L (nucleotides), is related to m and the PcrA contact size, d (nucleotides) by Equation 2. n=L-dm(Eq. 2) Kinetics of PcrA Monomer Dissociation from poly(dT)—The dissociation rate constant of PcrA monomer from internal ssDNA sites, kd, during PcrA translocation was measured using poly(dT) by monitoring the enhancement of PcrA tryptophan fluorescence upon dissociation from the poly(dT) as described (7Fischer C.J. Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1287-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The final solution conditions after mixing were 40 nm PcrA monomer, 2.5 mm ATP, 4 mg/ml heparin, 12 μm poly(dT) (in units of nucleotides) in Buffer L at 25 °C or 20 nm PcrA monomer, 0.5 mm ATP, 4 mg/ml heparin, 10 μm poly(dT) (in units of nucleotides) in Buffer H at 20 °C. Single Turnover DNA Unwinding Time Courses—DNA unwinding experiments under single turnover conditions were performed using a three pulsed quenched flow apparatus (Kin-Tek RQF-3, University Park, PA) as described (20Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 24Maluf N.K. Fischer C.J. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 913-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). PcrA was preincubated with the DNA substrate (cold DNA was spiked with 1 nm 32P-labeled DNA of the same sequence) on ice for 20 min in Buffer L or Buffer H and then loaded in one loop (18 μl) of the quenched flow apparatus. The other loop was loaded with Buffer L containing 2.5 mm ATP, 4 mg/ml heparin (a trap for free PcrA protein), and 2.5 μm of the unlabeled top strand of the DNA substrate (to prevent reannealing of the unwound DNA) or Buffer H containing 0.5 mm ATP, 4 mg/ml heparin, and 2.5 μm unlabeled top DNA strand. All of the concentrations are final concentrations after mixing. The two loops were incubated for 5 min at the indicated temperature before initiating the reaction by mixing. The reactions were terminated by mixing with quench solution (0.4 m EDTA + 10% (v/v) glycerol) after time intervals ranging from 40 ms to 60 s. The background fraction of ssDNA at t = 0 was determined by mixing the PcrA-DNA complex with Buffer H or Buffer L containing traps but in the absence of ATP, and these values were subtracted from each time point. An aliquot of 10% (v/v) SDS solution was added to each sample to a final concentration of 1% and mixed by vortexing. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in a nondenaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel to separate the ssDNA product from the dsDNA substrate. The radioactivity in each band was quantified using a STORM 840 phosphorimager (GE Healthcare), and the fraction of DNA duplexes unwound as a function of time, f(t), was calculated using Equation 3 (57Amaratunga M.

https://openalex.org/W1982008071,"The Ctr1 family of integral membrane proteins is necessary for high affinity copper uptake in eukaryotes. Ctr1 is also involved in cellular accumulation of cisplatin, a platinum-based anticancer drug. Although the physiological role of Ctr1 has been revealed, the mechanism of action of Ctr1 remains to be elucidated. To gain a better understanding of Ctr1-mediated copper and cisplatin transport, we have monitored molecular dynamics and transport activities of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ctr1 and its mutant alleles. Co-expression of functional Ctr1 monomers fused with either cyan or yellow fluorescent protein resulted in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), which is consistent with multimer assembly of Ctr1. Copper near the Km value of Ctr1 enhanced FRET in a manner that correlated with cellular copper transport. In vitro cross-linking of Ctr1 confirmed that copper-induced FRET reflects conformational changes within pre-existing Ctr1 complexes. FRET assays in membrane-disrupted cells and protein extracts showed that intact cell structure is necessary for Ctr1 activity. Despite Ctr1-dependent cellular accumulation, cisplatin did not change Ctr1 FRET nor did it attenuate copper-induced FRET. A Ctr1 allele defective in copper transport enhanced cellular cisplatin accumulation. N-terminal methionine-rich motifs that are dispensable for copper transport play a critical role for cisplatin uptake. Taken together, our data reveal functional roles for structural remodeling of the Ctr1 multimeric complex in copper transport and suggest distinct mechanisms employed by Ctr1 for copper and cisplatin transport.

FRET assays in membrane-disrupted cells and protein extracts showed that intact cell structure is necessary for Ctr1 activity. Despite Ctr1-dependent cellular accumulation, cisplatin did not change Ctr1 FRET nor did it attenuate copper-induced FRET. A Ctr1 allele defective in copper transport enhanced cellular cisplatin accumulation. N-terminal methionine-rich motifs that are dispensable for copper transport play a critical role for cisplatin uptake. Taken together, our data reveal functional roles for structural remodeling of the Ctr1 multimeric complex in copper transport and suggest distinct mechanisms employed by Ctr1 for copper and cisplatin transport. Copper is a vital micronutrient required for the normal growth and development of many organisms from bacteria to humans (1Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper.in: Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar). Copper mediates electron transfer reactions by virtue of its ability to donate or accept electrons through redox reactions (1Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper.in: Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, copper can serve as a cofactor for enzymes involved in a variety of essential physiological processes, including respiration, free radical detoxification, neurotransmission, iron metabolism, and signaling (1Linder M.C. Biochemistry of Copper.in: Plenum Press, New York1991Crossref Google Scholar, 2Pena M.M. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). However, copper can readily catalyze reactions, which result in the production of toxic hydroxyl radicals (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.

The essential yet toxic nature of copper has been underscored by copper-related disorders in humans and animals. Nutritional copper deficiency leads to defects in growth and development (1Linder M.C.

Menkes and Wilson diseases are characterized by symptoms resulting from copper deficiency and excess accumulation, respectively (5Kaler S.G. Am. J. Clin.

Delicate mechanisms for uptake, distribution, storage, and excretion of copper are involved in homeostatic copper metabolism. The baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been a useful model for the characterization of molecular mechanisms of copper metabolism in eukaryotes, because the structure and function for most of the molecular components involved in homeostatic metabolism of copper in yeast are conserved in other eukaryotes, including humans (2Pena M.M.

Extracellular copper exists in its oxidized form and is reduced by cell surface metalloreductases prior to transport (16Hassett R. Kosman D.J. J. Biol.

Characterization of yeast, mice, and human cell lines where the Ctr1 gene is deleted or overexpressed have demonstrated that Ctr1 is a necessary factor in high affinity copper uptake and supplies copper for all known copper-dependent physiological processes (17Dancis A.

Several proteins, such as Cox17 and Sco1, are involved in copper insertion into cytochrome c oxidase (23Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

Copper sequestration is handled by metallothioneins, which chelate excess copper to protect organisms from copper toxicity (26Mehra R.K. Winge D.R. J. Cell.

Given that Ctr2 is a vacuolar copper exporter (28Rees E.M. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54221-54229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the vacuole may also serve as a copper storage and detoxification organelle. The copper-dependent transcriptional regulation of genes encoding components of copper acquisition and detoxification, including Ctr1 and metalloreductases, has been characterized in yeast (2Pena M.M.

In addition, copper can also trigger the internalization and degradation of Ctr1 in yeast and human cells (51Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 52Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

However, given that contrasting results have been reported as well (58Klomp A.E. Tops B.B. Van Denberg I.E. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem.

Recent studies have implicated a new role for Ctr1 in the cellular accumulation of the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin 2The abbreviations used are:cisplatincis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)BCSbathocuproine disulfonic acidECFPenhanced cyan fluorescent proteinEGSethyleneglycol bis(succinimidylsuccinate)EYFPenhanced yellow fluorescent proteinFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidSCsynthetic completeICPMSinductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)) and its analogues. Deletion of the yeast and mouse Ctr1 results in increased cisplatin resistance and a decrease in cisplatin accumulation (60Ishida S. Lee J. Thiele D.J. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ATP7A and ATP7B, two copper efflux transporters, are also involved in cisplatin efflux (63Safaei R. Howell S.B. Crit. Rev. Oncol.

Molecular Biology of Metal Homeostasis and Detoxification: From Microbes to Man (Topics in Current Genetics).in: Tamás M. Martinoia E. 14. SpringerVerlag, Berlin Heidelberg2006: 1-36Google Scholar), however site-directed mutagenesis and truncation of Ctr1 have identified several residues that play roles in multimer assembly and copper transport (36Puig S.

For example, the methionine-rich motifs, which reside at the extracellular surface of Ctr1 family members appear to be involved in enhancing the efficiency of copper transport (36Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Three conserved methionine residues, one at the extracellular N terminus and two at the predicted second trans-membrane domain, have been proposed as copper binding residues during copper translocation (36Puig S.

Several lines of biochemical, genetic, and biophysical analyses indicate that Ctr1 multimerizes at the plasma membrane (31Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

A recent projection structure of human Ctr1 determined using two-dimensional cryoelectron crystallography further showed that human Ctr1 forms a compact trimer with a novel channel-like architecture rather than the structural design of active transporters (53Aller S.G. Unger V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This feature of Ctr1 assembly suggests that copper is translocated through the pore formed at the center of the Ctr1 trimer complex. Alternatively, like other typical transporters Ctr1-mediated copper translocation may be coupled with structural remodeling in the Ctr1 multimeric complex. Because Ctr1 family members do not carry a domain that is implicated in ATP utilization as a source of energy (2Pena M.M. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 17Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D.

Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To gain better insights into the mechanisms of action of Ctr1, we monitored molecular events coupled with Ctr1 transport activities and measured cellular copper and cisplatin uptake in yeast S. cerevisiae. Co-expression of yeast Ctr1 monomers tagged with either cyan or yellow fluorescent protein at the cytoplasmic C terminus resulted in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in yeast cells. Quantification of copper-induced FRET changes between Ctr1 monomers in situ and cross-linking and Western blot analysis of Ctr1 showed that copper induces conformational changes of the Ctr1 multimeric complex. Correlation of FRET changes in Ctr1 with cellular copper uptake revealed an implication of structural remodeling of Ctr1 in copper translocation, which suggests transporter-like activity of Ctr1. Measurement of cisplatin-induced Ctr1 FRET and cellular cisplatin accumulation by Ctr1 mutant alleles showed that the mechanism of cisplatin uptake differs from the one employed during copper uptake. Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—A BY4741 haploid S. cerevisiae strain (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0), in which Ctr1 gene is knocked out (ctr1::kanMX4) and Ctr3 gene is not expressed (Open Biosystems) (43Winzeler E.A.

Yeast cells were cultured with synthetic complete (SC) media (2% dextrose, 0.2% amino acid mixture, and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base) lacking specific markers for plasmid selection or YPD (2% dextrose, 2% Bacto-peptone, 1% yeast extract) media. Solid media were prepared with the supplementation of 1.5% agar. SUCFM medium (51Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (0.67% yeast nitrogen base minus copper (Bio 101), 0.08% amino acid mixture, 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.1) was used for culturing cells at low copper growth conditions. Yeast cell growth on non-fermentable carbon source media was tested using YPEG media (2% Bacto-peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% ethanol, 3% glycerol, 1.5% agar). Yeast cells were cultured at 30 °C, if no growth temperature is specified. Plasmid Construction and Manipulation—Ctr1 and Ctr3 coding sequence was amplified from yeast genomic DNA by PCR using gene-specific primer sets that are flanked by HindIII (5′-end) and XhoI (3′-end) sites. For the epitope tagging at the C terminus of Ctr1, an NotI restriction enzyme site was inserted in the reverse primer just before the stop codon. The HindIII- and XhoI-digested PCR product was cloned into the p415-TEF or p416-TEF yeast vector (44Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) for a constitutive TEF gene promoter-mediated expression of Ctr1 and Ctr3. ECFP and EYFP coding sequences without start and stop codons were PCR-amplified from pECFP-C1 and pEYFP plasmids (BD Biosciences-Clontech), respectively, with gene-specific primer sets flanked by NotI sites. The ECFP and EYFP PCR products were inserted into the NotI site of Ctr1 cloned in p416-TEF and p415-TEF vectors, respectively. A Ctr1 mutant allele carrying a site-directed mutation of the conserved methionine (Met-127) to alanine (M1) and a mutant allele with a deletion of all eight N terminus Met-rich motifs (Δ8) (36Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) was inserted into the same vectors. ECFP or EYFP was fused at the C-terminal tail of the Ctr1 mutant alleles. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Common molecular biology techniques, including plasmid amplification using Escherichia coli, and purification, followed previously established methods (45Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocol in Molecular Biology. 1987; (Wiley, New York)Google Scholar). Plasmid transformation into yeast was performed using the lithium acetate method (46Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Cells transformed with the p415-TEF and p416-TEF vectors were selected and maintained using SC media lacking leucine and uracil. Functional Assays of Ctr1 Fused with ECFP and EYFP—The function of wild-type Ctr1 and Ctr1 fused with either ECFP or EYFP was determined by complementation studies in the BY4741 yeast strain carrying a Ctr1 deletion (ctr1Δ). Briefly, BY4741 ctr1Δ cells expressing empty vector, wild-type Ctr1, or Ctr1 fused with ECFP and EYFP were grown to mid-log phase (A600 = 1.0) in SC-selective media. Cells (∼5 μl) were spotted on YPEG media containing non-fermentable carbon sources where BY4741 ctr1Δ cells are not able to grow due to a defect in copper-dependent cytochrome c oxidase activities. Growth of BY4741 ctr1Δ cells transformed with vectors expressing Ctr1 or ECFP- or EYFP-fused Ctr1 was compared. Fluorescence Microscopy—BY4741 ctr1Δ cells expressing wild-type or ECFP-tagged and/or EYFP-tagged Ctr1 were grown in SC media lacking leucine and uracil to mid-log phase. Cells were visualized using a confocal microscope (Olympus FV500) to localize Ctr1-ECFP and Ctr1-EYFP and determine the FRET between Ctr1 monomers. Cells were excited at 433 nm and 500 nm to observe ECFP and EYFP, respectively. Emission signals of ECFP and EYFP were detected at 475 nm and 525 nm, respectively. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 8.0. Quantification of FRET—A scanning fluorometer was used to quantify FRET from yeast cells (BY4741 ctr1Δ) co-expressing functional Ctr1 tagged with either EYFP or ECFP at the C terminus. The method for measuring FRET efficiency in yeast cells suspended in buffer using a scanning fluorometry has been previously described (47Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41463-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells cultured to mid-log phase in selective media were washed twice using PIPES buffer (50 mm, pH 6.0), and re-suspended in the same buffer to A600 1.0 (∼107 cells/ml). Fluorescent emission spectra by the excitation of ECFP or EYFP were obtained using a scanning fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50). Cells were excited at 433 nm (ECFP excitation), and the emission was recorded from 460 nm to 580 nm. The following factors were considered to calculate the FRET efficiency in cells expressing both Ctr1-ECFP and Ctr1-EYFP. First, the emission spectrum from cells expressing untagged Ctr1 was subtracted to eliminate signal coming from auto fluorescence. Second, the emission spectrum of cells expressing Ctr1-ECFP and Ctr1 upon excitation of ECFP at 433 nm was obtained. This spectrum was subtracted to eliminate emission resulting from excitation of ECFP. Third, the emission spectrum upon excitation of EYFP at 433 nm of cells expressing Ctr1-EYFP with untagged Ctr1 was subtracted, which eliminates EYFP emission resulting from direct excitation at 433 nm. The spectrum obtained after completing these three steps is the EYFP emission resulting from FRET. FRET efficiency was calculated by dividing the EYFP emission peak area resulting from FRET by the peak area of the EYFP emission resulting from direct excitation of EYFP at 500 nm. Excel and Igor Pro (version 5.0) programs were used for data processing and statistical analysis. Metal-induced FRET—To measure copper-induced changes in FRET, copper (CuCl2, 2.5–25 μm) was added to PIPES buffer (50 mm, pH 6.0) containing yeast cells. Cells were gently mixed with copper at room temperature for 0–45 s and were scanned with a fluorometer for 75 s (total incubation time, 75–120 s). To determine metal specificities and cisplatin effect on Ctr1 FRET, we applied several metal ions, including silver (AgNO3), cobalt (CoSO4), zinc (ZnCl2), and cadmium (CdCl2) purchased from Sigma, and cisplatin (American Pharmaceutical Partners Inc. and Sigma). Temperature dependence in copper-induced FRET was measured from cells preincubated at 0, 10, 25, and 30 °C for 15 min. In Vitro FRET Assays—BY4741 ctr1Δ cells transformed with Ctr1-ECFP and/or Ctr1-EYFP expression plasmids were cultured in selective media to mid-log phase. Cells were washed with ice-cold water and suspended in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5) with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science). Cells were vortexed with acid-washed glass beads at full speed six times for 2 min and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was considered as a broken-cell fraction. To solubilize proteins, the samples were incubated with Triton X-100 (1% final concentration) for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant containing total protein extract was collected. Plasma membrane-disrupted cells, and total protein extracts were suspended in PIPES buffer (50 mm, pH 6.0) at the concentration of 60 μg/ml. FRET efficiency in the samples was measured with or without copper supplementation by scanning fluorometry using the same method as described above. Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were denatured in SDS sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Ctr1-ECFP was detected by chemiluminescence using anti-GFP antibodies (1:2,000) that detects not only GFP but also ECFP and EYFP, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:8,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphoglycerate kinase was detected as loading control by chemiluminescence u"

Here, we demonstrate that the telomere bouquet plays a crucial role in controlling the behavior of the fission yeast microtubule-organizing center (known as the spindle pole body or SPB) and the meiotic spindle. Using mutations that specifically disrupt the bouquet, we analyze chromosome, SPB, and spindle dynamics throughout meiosis. If the bouquet fails to form, the SPB becomes fragmented at meiosis I, leading to monopolar, multiple, and mislocalized spindles. Correct SPB and spindle behavior require not only the SPB recruitment of telomere proteins but also that the proteins are properly bound to telomeric DNA. This discovery illuminates an unanticipated level of communication between chromosomes and the spindle apparatus that may be widely conserved among eukaryotes.

This discovery illuminates an unanticipated level of communication between chromosomes and the spindle apparatus that may be widely conserved among eukaryotes. Sexual reproduction and genetic variation are instigated by the halving and blending of parental genomes that occur during meiosis. To promote reductional nuclear division and homolog recombination, the meiotic cycle differs from the mitotic cycle in key ways. While both have at their core the formation of a spindle that carries chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell in a highly choreographed fashion, the separation of homologs, rather than sisters, at meiosis I entails a different mode of chromosome-spindle interaction. Hence, it is perhaps not surprising that dramatic chromosome movements are an inherent feature of meiotic prophase. During the early stages of meiosis, all the telomeres in the cell gather at the nuclear envelope, often near the centrosome. This polarized chromosome arrangement has been dubbed the “bouquet,” as the collected chromosome ends reminded early 20th century microscopists of the stems of a floral bouquet. The extraordinary conservation of the bouquet throughout eukaryotes suggests that it plays an important role in promoting successful meiosis. As the bouquet stage coincides with the period in which homologous chromosome pairing begins, a reasonable proposal has evolved that by anchoring all chromosome ends within a limited volume, the bouquet functions to facilitate the homology search. Here we extend the view of bouquet function to include a role in setting up a special chromosome-spindle interaction that is crucial for meiotic progression. The meiotic bouquet of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is particularly easy to discern and analyze. The small chromosome number of this organism (three per haploid genome) confers a tight focal appearance to the gathered telomeres, which remain in the bouquet configuration for the entirety of meiotic prophase. Fission yeast grow as haploids, but when they are exposed to conditions of nitrogen starvation, haploids of opposite mating type undergo sexual differentiation, mating, and meiosis, ultimately forming an ascus that contains four haploid spores. These events are accompanied by progressive alterations in nuclear organization: During mitotic interphase, centromeres localize to a single cluster adjacent to the SPB (Funabiki et al., 1993Funabiki H. Hagan I. Uzawa S. Yanagida M. Cell cycle-dependent specific positioning and clustering of centromeres and telomeres in fission yeast.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 961-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), which is located on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear membrane (Ding et al., 1997Ding R. West R.R. Morphew D.M. Oakley B.R. McIntosh J.R. The spindle pole body of Schizosaccharomyces pombe enters and leaves the nuclear envelope as the cell cycle proceeds.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1461-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, in cells responding to the pheromones that are secreted upon sexual differentiation, the telomeres gather at the SPB. Once these haploids mate to form the zygote, their SPBs fuse, duplicate, and separate from the centromeres, leaving the telomere bouquet as the only connection between chromosomes and the SPB (Chikashige et al., 1994Chikashige Y. Ding D.Q. Funabiki H. Haraguchi T. Mashiko S. Yanagida M. Hiraoka Y.

Meiotic nuclear reorganization: switching the position of centromeres and telomeres in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This bouquet persists through the subsequent stage in which the nucleus oscillates back and forth through the cytoplasm, creating an elongated nuclear shape that has been dubbed the “horsetail” (Chikashige et al., 1994Chikashige Y. Ding D.Q. Funabiki H. Haraguchi T. Mashiko S. Yanagida M. Hiraoka Y. Telomere-led premeiotic chromosome movement in fission yeast.Science. 1994; 264: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This moving nucleus is led by the SPB, which is pulled by cytoplasmic microtubules powered by the meiosis-specific dynein motor (Ding et al., 1998Ding D.Q. Chikashige Y. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Oscillatory nuclear movement in fission yeast meiotic prophase is driven by astral microtubules, as revealed by continuous observation of chromosomes and microtubules in living cells.J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1233-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). During this horsetail stage, meiotic recombination occurs, having been initiated by Rec12, the fission yeast Spo11 homolog that creates meiotic DNA breaks (De Veaux et al., 1992De Veaux L.C. Hoagland N.A. Smith G.R. Seventeen complementation groups of mutations decreasing meiotic recombination in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Genetics. 1992; 130: 251-262PubMed Google Scholar). Horsetail movement ceases just prior to meiosis I, and the SPB undergoes a poorly defined maturation process, in which its components accumulate and it divides in two. The resulting SPBs insert into the nuclear membrane, a bipolar intranuclear spindle is generated between them, and the chromosomes undergo the reductional segregation of meiosis I. The telomeres are known to dissociate from the SPB prior to meiosis I (Chikashige et al., 1994Chikashige Y. Ding D.Q. Funabiki H. Haraguchi T. Mashiko S. Yanagida M. Hiraoka Y. Telomere-led premeiotic chromosome movement in fission yeast.Science. 1994; 264: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Meiosis II comprises a second round of SPB maturation and spindle formation, followed by equational chromosome segregation. Several genes involved in bouquet formation have been isolated in S. pombe. Fragmentation of the bouquet was first observed in kms1Δ cells (Shimanuki et al., 1997Shimanuki M. Miki F. Ding D.Q. Chikashige Y. Hiraoka Y. Horio T. Niwa O. A novel fission yeast gene, kms1+, is required for the formation of meiotic prophase-specific nuclear architecture.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 238-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, this deletion disrupts the SPB itself, while leaving telomeres associated with the dispersed SPB fragments. Bouquet formation itself is disrupted in cells lacking the telomere-binding protein Taz1, its interacting partner Rap1, or the heterochromatin factors Rik1 or Clr4 (Chikashige and Hiraoka, 2001Chikashige Y.

Finally, systematic microarray-based screens have recently identified a pair of meiosis-specific proteins, Bqt1 and Bqt2, whose activities are crucial to bouquet formation (Chikashige et al., 2006Chikashige Y.

Despite progress in understanding the mechanisms of bouquet formation, its function is still a matter of speculation. The taz1Δ strain shows reduced homolog pairing along chromosome arms, although pairing in the centromere region is unaffected (Ding et al., 2004Ding D.Q. Yamamoto A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Dynamics of homologous chromosome pairing during meiotic prophase in fission yeast.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells lacking Taz1, Bqt1, or Bqt2 show reduced levels of meiotic recombination (Chikashige et al., 2006Chikashige Y. Tsutsumi C. Yamane M. Okamasa K. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y.

Defective meiosis in telomere-silencing mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Nature. 1998; 392: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Hence, the idea that the bouquet promotes homologous pairing and meiotic recombination has found qualitative support in accordance with the classic speculation (reviewed in Harper et al., 2004Harper L. Golubovskaya I. Cande W.Z. A bouquet of chromosomes.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4025-4032Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, the extent to which recombination is reduced in bouquet-deficient strains is not entirely consistent with their defects in spore formation. Horsetail-deficient mutants of S. pombe (dhc1Δ, ssm4Δ, hrs1(mcp6)Δ, and num1(mcp5)Δ), in which telomeres cluster properly at the SPB but the SPB fails to traverse the zygote, show more severely impaired meiotic recombination than bouquet-defective strains without compromised spore viability (Niccoli et al., 2004Niccoli T.

Hence, the bouquet may promote recombination largely by allowing horsetail movement, but it clearly serves other functions that are not dependent on horsetail movement. These observations stimulated us to explore the phenotypes of cells lacking stable bouquet formation in greater depth. Using fission yeast genetics and live microscopy, we demonstrate that telomere clustering to the SPB is crucial for SPB maturation and proper meiotic spindle formation, highlighting an unexpected level of control of the spindle apparatus by chromosomes. To investigate the function of the meiotic bouquet, we examined the phenotypes of cells harboring mutations that disrupt bouquet formation. taz1+ deletion abolishes the stable association of telomeres with the SPB and yields reduced levels of meiotic recombination along with strikingly aberrant asci whose spores are largely inviable (Cooper et al., 1997Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Regulation of telomere length and function by a Myb-domain protein in fission yeast.Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, Cooper et al., 1998Cooper J.P. Watanabe Y.

In principle, the latter defects may stem from the disruption of bouquet formation conferred by taz1+ deletion. However, taz1Δ zygotes suffer an additional defect, as loss of Taz1 leads to telomere fusions, mediated by the nonhomologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ), during the G1 arrest period that precedes meiosis (Ferreira and Cooper, 2001Ferreira M.G. Cooper J.P. The fission yeast Taz1 protein protects chromosomes from Ku-dependent end-to-end fusions.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To specifically address bouquet function without complications from chromosome end fusions, we deleted the genes encoding participants of the NHEJ pathway (Lig4 or pKu70) in a taz1Δ background. lig4+ or pku70+ deletion prevents taz1Δ telomere fusions and partially rescues the defects in ascus formation and spore viability seen in taz1Δ meiosis (Tuzon et al., 2004Tuzon C.T. Borgstrom B. Weilguny D. Egel R. Cooper J.P. Nielsen O. The fission yeast heterochromatin protein Rik1 is required for telomere clustering during meiosis.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 759-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar; Figure 1B). Nonetheless, while no meiotic defects are seen in lig4Δ single mutants, taz1Δlig4Δ meiosis is markedly defective (Figures 1A and 1B). To characterize the defects in taz1Δlig4Δ meiosis, we examined the distribution of DNA and SPB signals in asci in which the SPB component Cut12 (Bridge et al., 1998Bridge A.J. Morphew M. Bartlett R. Hagan I.M. The fission yeast SPB component Cut12 links bipolar spindle formation to mitotic control.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 927-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) is tagged with GFP at its endogenous locus (Figure 1A). Approximately 50% of taz1Δlig4Δ asci are normal tetrads in which all spores have equal amounts of DNA and SPB signal (Figures 1Aa and 1B); these spores are largely viable (Figure S1A). However, the remaining taz1Δlig4Δ asci are aberrant, having fewer than four spores or four spores of uneven size and shape. The majority of these asci appear to have failed in meiotic progression and have undergone spore formation without completing meiosis (Figures 1Ab–1Ae). We also observe asci in which some DNA is left outside of any spore (Figure 1Af). However, in those asci containing two masses of DNA, the two masses are often equal in DAPI staining intensity (Figure 1Ac), suggesting that when meiosis I does occur, the chromosomes tend to segregate equally. Likewise, in asci containing three masses of DNA, there are usually two masses of equal DAPI staining intensity and a third that is twice as intense, suggesting that meiosis I and II occurred properly in half of the ascus, while meiosis II failed in the other half (Figure 1Ad). Thus, while lig4+ deletion partially rescues the profound chromosome segregation defect seen in taz1Δ meiosis, meiotic progression in a taz1Δlig4Δ background is often impeded and uncoupled from spore formation. The meiotic bouquet is thought to promote pairing and recombination between homologs, which are in turn crucial for reductional chromosome segregation at meiosis I. We measured intergenic recombination between a number of loci at various positions along chromosome II in the taz1Δlig4Δ background (Figure 1C). While the progeny derived from lig4Δ meiosis show wild-type (WT) levels of recombination, taz1Δlig4Δ meiosis yields a reduction in recombination frequency between two pairs of markers, leu1-mat1 and his3-leu1, both of which lie near the centromere. Recombination within the long interval leu1-arg4 is frequent enough to guarantee ≥1 crossover in this region, although its length prohibits us from assigning significance to differences between strains. We note that we may underestimate deficits in recombination, as we can only assess recombination in colonies produced from viable spores. At a more telomere-proximal region, taz1+ deletion does not yield reduced recombination. We speculate that this stems from two competing effects: the loss of Taz1 confers a subtelomeric hyper-recombination phenotype (M.G. Ferreira and J.P.C., unpublished data; Miller et al., 2006Miller K.M. Rog O. Cooper J.P. Semi-conservative DNA replication through telomeres requires Taz1.Nature. 2006; 440: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), which might counteract any reduction in meiotic recombination conferred by disruption of the bouquet. Thus, while gene conversion frequencies throughout chromosome II are moderately reduced in taz1Δlig4Δ strains, at least one crossover is expected to be established and should be sufficient for meiosis I. We also confirmed that reductional segregation occurs properly in those taz1Δlig4Δ zygotes that undergo meiosis I (Figure S1). During the bouquet stage, telomeres associate with the SPB via physical interactions between Taz1, Rap1, Bqt1, and Bqt2 (Chikashige et al., 2006Chikashige Y. Tsutsumi C. Yamane M. Okamasa K. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Meiotic proteins bqt1 and bqt2 tether telomeres to form the bouquet arrangement of chromosomes.Cell. 2006; 125: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Rap1 is a Taz1-binding protein whose loss leads to telomere fusions upon G1 arrest as well as a complete loss of bouquet formation. As seen for taz1Δ meiosis, the defects in rap1Δ meiosis are partially rescued by the concomitant deletion of lig4+. rap1Δlig4Δ strains show high levels of abnormal asci and reduced levels of meiotic recombination (Figures 1B and 1C). bqt1Δ strains, which also completely lack telomere bouquets, show defects in spore formation and meiotic recombination similar to those seen in rap1Δlig4Δ strains (Chikashige et al., 2006Chikashige Y. Tsutsumi C. Yamane M. Okamasa K. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Meiotic proteins bqt1 and bqt2 tether telomeres to form the bouquet arrangement of chromosomes.Cell. 2006; 125: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, Martin-Castellanos et al., 2005Martin-Castellanos C.

Biol. 2005; 15: 2056-2062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar; and Figures 1C and S2 and Table S3). Thus, all of the bouquet-defective strains show abnormal ascus formation and reduced meiotic recombination. To gain perspective on the severity of the recombination deficiency seen in the bouquet-defective strains, we compared them with strains lacking the fission yeast dynein motor protein, Dhc1, which is required for meiotic horsetail movement but not for formation of the bouquet (Figure S2; Yamamoto et al., 1999Yamamoto A. West R.R. McIntosh J.R. Hiraoka Y. A cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain is required for oscillatory nuclear movement of meiotic prophase and efficient meiotic recombination in fission yeast.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1233-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). dhc1Δ meiosis produces largely four-spored asci despite markedly lower levels of meiotic recombination (Yamamoto et al., 1999Yamamoto A. West R.R. McIntosh J.R. Hiraoka Y. A cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain is required for oscillatory nuclear movement of meiotic prophase and efficient meiotic recombination in fission yeast.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1233-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar; Figures 1B and 1C). Thus, bouquet mutants show defects in ascus formation that are disproportionate to their mild defects in recombination. The foregoing results indicate that taz1Δlig4Δ zygotes have a spore formation defect, showing numerous asci in which either meiosis I or meiosis II has failed. Nonetheless, in those taz1Δlig4Δ zygotes that do undergo the first meiotic division, chromosomes undergo an accurate reductional segregation. This observation suggests that the defects in taz1Δlig4Δ asci cannot be due entirely to defects in homologous recombination. Hence, we performed a detailed live analysis to determine when and how meiotic progression fails. To monitor meiotic progression in live cells, we constructed strains in which one copy of the gene encoding histone H3 is tagged with mRFP (Campbell et al., 2002Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. A monomeric red fluorescent protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar) and the SPB component Pcp1 (orthologous to budding yeast Spc110; Flory et al., 2002Flory M.R. Morphew M. Joseph J.D. Means A.R. Davis T.N.

Under the conditions we use for live analysis, most WT cells finish meiosis normally and produce four healthy spores (see Experimental Procedures). Delayed segregation of a fraction of chromosomes (the “lagging chromosome” phenotype) is occasionally observed, but this does not affect the final chromosome distribution (Figure S3A). Thus, the experimental stress of repeated exposure to light imposed by timelapse microscopy appears not to significantly affect meiosis. Pcp1 signals are weak during meiotic prophase in WT cells, and their foci can be seen to migrate back and forth across the zygote as the horsetail nucleus traverses the cell. Throughout this period, chromosome movement follows SPB movement (Figure 2A; ∼60 min). The Pcp1 signal intensifies at the end of the horsetail stage (70 min), localizes to the center of the cell, and divides to form two SPB signals that migrate symmetrically to opposite ends of the zygote as it undergoes meiosis I (75∼110 min). Then the SPBs duplicate for meiosis II, during which each pair of SPBs remains near the respective tip of the zygote (120∼160 min). In taz1Δlig4Δ zygotes, SPBs move normally during the horsetail stage even though they are rarely associated with chromatin. However, as the horsetail stage ends and meiosis I begins, the Pcp1-GFP signals appear brighter than in WT cells and are markedly disorganized (Figure 2B; 75 min). In addition, they frequently fail to localize to opposite ends of the zygote at anaphase I (Figures 2B and 2C). This phenomenon is also observed in bqt1Δ single mutant backgrounds (Figure 2D) in which telomere integrity is intact (data not shown), indicating that it stems not from some aspect of the DNA-damage response that occurs at taz1Δ telomeres but rather from the failure of these telomeres to form a bouquet. Moreover, similar results were obtained by visualizing the SPB through other tagged SPB components, including Sid4-GFP, Sad1-GFP, and Cut12-GFP (Figure S4; data not shown). Hence, the SPB behaves aberrantly in the absence of stable bouquet formation. Chromosome segregation defects can also be observed in some taz1Δlig4Δ zygotes that contain normal SPB signals. These defects include cases in which chromosomes fail to reach the tips of the zygote and repeatedly pull back toward the middle but eventually segregate (Figures S3C and S3E). This rare phenotype is specific to the taz1Δlig4Δ background and is not found among rap1Δlig4Δ or bqt1Δ zygotes (Figure S3D and Table S3). We suspect that this aberrant chromosome behavior stems from the defect in replication fork progression seen in taz1Δ cells but not in rap1Δ or bqt1Δ cells. As expected, chromosome fusions that are not resolved at anaphase are frequently seen in taz1Δ meiosis when Lig4 is present (Figure S3B) and the nuclei fail to segregate (Figure S1B). As the SPB nucleates the yeast spindle, we next asked whether the aberrant SPB behavior seen in the absence of a stable bouquet is associated with defective spindle formation. To visualize microtubules, we use strains containing an ectopically integrated copy of the gene encoding α-tubulin fused with GFP (GFP-Atb2; Ding et al., 1998Ding D.Q. Chikashige Y. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Oscillatory nuclear movement in fission yeast meiotic prophase is driven by astral microtubules, as revealed by continuous observation of chromosomes and microtubules in living cells.J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 701-712PubMed Google Scholar). During WT meiotic prophase I, microtubules move back and forth across the cytoplasm, pulling the horsetail nucleus (Figure 3A; ∼55 mi"

Currently, it is not understood what the factors and events are that specify de-condensation. Here, we demonstrate that chromosome de-condensation needs the function of an inner nuclear membrane (INM) protein hsSUN1 and a membrane-associated histone acetyltransferase (HAT), hALP. We propose that nascently reforming nuclear envelope employs hsSUN1 and hALP to acetylate histones for de-compacting DNA at the end of mitosis.

We propose that nascently reforming nuclear envelope employs hsSUN1 and hALP to acetylate histones for de-compacting DNA at the end of mitosis. The eukaryotic nucleus is separated from other organelles by an envelope containing two membrane layers continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum. Nuclear membrane proteins fall into three categories according to their localization. The first group is the trans-nuclear membrane proteins resident in the nuclear pore complex (NPC). 2The abbreviations used are:NPCnuclear pore complexSUNSad1-UNC84ChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationINMinner nuclear membraneH3pSer10phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 10hALPhuman acetyl-transferase-like proteinLAPlamin-associated polypeptideLBRlamin B receptorHAThistone acetyltransferaseHDAChistone deacetylaseORFopen reading frameRIPAradioimmune precipitation assay bufferPBSphosphate-buffered salineGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutininDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleGFPgreen fluorescent proteinWTwild type 2The abbreviations used are:NPCnuclear pore complexSUNSad1-UNC84ChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationINMinner nuclear membraneH3pSer10phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 10hALPhuman acetyl-transferase-like proteinLAPlamin-associated polypeptideLBRlamin B receptorHAThistone acetyltransferaseHDAChistone deacetylaseORFopen reading frameRIPAradioimmune precipitation assay bufferPBSphosphate-buffered salineGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutininDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleGFPgreen fluorescent proteinWTwild type The second group contains the inner membrane proteins (INM), which include the lamin B receptor (LBR), emerin, and lamin-associated polypeptides (LAPs). The third group includes proteins underlying the nuclear membrane such as nuclear lamina (1Taddei A. Hediger F. Neumann F.R. Gasser S.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 305-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Functionally, the INM provides a physical barrier; the NPC serves for the transport of material between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (2Fahrenkrog B. Koser J. Aebi U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 175-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); and the nuclear lamina erects a meshwork, which maintains nuclear structure and assists indirectly in DNA replication and RNA processing (3Hutchison C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 848-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 4Mattout-Drubezki A. Gruenbaum Y. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 2053-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Most INM proteins are associated with the nuclear lamina. In a proteomic study of INM proteins, in addition to 13 known proteins, 67 uncharacterized open reading frames (ORFs) were identified (5Schirmer E.C. Florens L. Guan T. Yates J.R. II I Gerace L. Science. 2003; 301: 1380-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). 23 of these ORFs map to chromosome regions linked to a variety of dystrophies collectively termed “nuclear envelopathies” (5Schirmer E.C. Florens L. Guan T. Yates J.R. II I Gerace L. Science. 2003; 301: 1380-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These diseases have phenotypes ranging from cardiac and skeletal myopathies, lipodystrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and premature aging (6Burke B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E273-E274Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Burke B. Mounkes L.C. Stewart C.L. Traffic. 2001; 2: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Burke B.

Investig. 2004; 113: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have associated mutations in emerin, lamin A/C, and lamin B receptor with such pathologies (7Burke B. Mounkes L.C. Stewart C.L. Traffic. 2001; 2: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 9Worman H.J. Courvalin J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 349-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An emerging notion is that the INM proteins are needed to maintain nuclear integrity and guard against mechanical stress (10Holaska J.M. Wilson K.L. Mansharamani M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 11Holmer L. Worman H.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1741-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 12Shumaker D.K. Kuczmarski E.R. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Plausibly, then, tissues that experience high mechanical stress may have increased sensitivity to the consequence of mutated INM proteins. Nonetheless, a fuller understanding of how abnormalities in nuclear membrane contribute to pathogenesis remains to be elucidated.Some INM proteins have a Sad1-UNC84 (SUN) domain at their C termini (13Starr D.A. Han M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The SUN domain was first identified based on the sequence alignment of Sad1 of Schizosaccharomycespombe and UNC-84 of Caenorhabditis elegans (14Malone C.J. Fixsen W.D. Horvitz H.R. Han M. Development. 1999; 126: 3171-3181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All SUN proteins contain putative transmembrane regions, suggesting that they localize to membranes at some periods during the cell cycle. Curiously, steady state S. pombe Sad1 predominates at spindle pole bodies and has been inferred to function in the formation of the mitotic spindle (15Hagan I. Yanagida M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1033-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar); on the other hand, UNC-84 localizes in the C. elegans nuclear envelope (16Lee K.K. Starr D. Cohen M. Liu J. Han M. Wilson K.L. Gruenbaum Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 892-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Mammals have four SUN proteins, SUN1 (also called UNC84A), SUN2 (also called UN84B), a sperm-associated antigen 4-like (SPAG4) protein, and a hypothetical protein, MGC33329. To date, other than a described ability to bind nesprin-2 (17Crisp M. Liu Q. Roux K. Rattner J.B. Shanahan C. Burke B. Stahl P.D. Hodzic D. J.

We find that hsSUN1 is one of the earliest INM factors to associate with segregated daughter chromosomes in anaphase. Knockdown of hsSUN1 leads to hypoacetylated histones and delayed de-condensation of chromosomes at the end of mitosis. A HAT protein, hALP, previously reported to be associated with mammalian inner nuclear membrane (5Schirmer E.C. Florens L. Guan T. Yates J.R. II I Gerace L. Science. 2003; 301: 1380-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), was found to bind hsSUN1 and to be required for proper mitotic chromosome de-condensation. Our findings broach a mechanism used by nascently enveloped daughter nuclei to de-compact chromosomes, preparing them for gene expression in the impending interphase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—HsSUN1 (KIAA0810) and hALP cDNA (KIAA1709) were from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (22Kikuno R. Nagase T. Waki M. Ohara O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Full-length hsSUN1 (amino acids 1-785) was amplified from the KIAA0810 (hk05647s1) clone using PCR and ligated into pCDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen). HA-tagged full-length hsSUN1 and N- and C-terminal deletion mutants (amino acids 1-581, 1-479, 1-377, 1-238, 40-173, 103-785, 205-785, 307-785, 501-785) were constructed by amplifying the indicated sequences by PCR and cloning into pCDNA3.1+ vector. Full-length hALP (amino acids 1-1025, clone fj18302) was amplified by PCR and tagged with FLAG for detection purposes.Anti-hsSUN1 Antibody Preparation—HsSUN1 amino acids 362-785 were expressed in the pGEX5x-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant GST-fused hsSUN1-(362-785) protein was used for rabbit immunization (Spring Valley Laboratories). Rabbit hsSUN1 antiserum (αhsSUN1-C) was first captured with protein A-agarose (Bio-Rad), and then affinity-purified using GST-hsSUN1-(362-785) fusion protein conjugated to Affi-Gel15 (Bio-Rad).Western Blotting—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and antibiotics. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped from the culture plate, pelleted, and lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences)) containing 1% SDS. For the peptide competition assay, total cell lysates were analyzed by 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and subjected to immunoblotting. Affinity-purified anti-hsSUN1 was either preincubated with GST-agarose, GST-agarose plus 100 μl of purified GST (400 μg/ml), or GST-agarose plus GST-hsSUN1-(362-785) fusion protein (300 μg/ml, 50 and 200 μl, respectively). Antibodies after incubation with/without GST-agarose plus GST or GST-hsSUN1 fusion proteins were then added to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes blocked with 0.2% I-Block (Tropix) in PBS and 0.1% Tween-20 (Bio-Rad). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody was added, and the blots were developed by chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's protocol (Tropix).Chromatin Association Assay—The chromatin association assay was performed by modifying the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) protocol described by Upstate. Briefly, cells were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 24 h later, cells were cross-linked by adding 1% formaldehyde to the medium and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by addition of 0.125 m glycine and incubation at room temperature for another 10 min. Cells were washed with cold PBS, scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation. To extract soluble chromatin and its associated proteins, cells were lysed in SDS-lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture) and sonicated for 5 times for 10-s pulses (Branson, Sonifier, Model 450) and incubated on ice inbetween. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Soluble fractions of cell lysates were diluted 50 times in RIPA buffer (as described in Western blotting) and incubated with monoclonal anti-HA or anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) for 16 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed five times with RIPA buffer. Before analyzing the samples with SDS-PAGE, samples were boiled in one volume of 2× Laemmli loading buffer (2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, bromphenol blue) for 30 min to reverse the cross-linking.Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. To block nonspecific binding, cells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Antibodies against hsSUN1, emerin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), nuclear pore complex (mab414, Covance), α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), CENP-A (MBL) and anti-LAP2 (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-LBR (Epitomics) were added to cells at dilutions of 1:200 to 1:2000 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then probed with fluorescent (Alexa-488, Alexa-594, or Alexa-647)-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes). Cells on the coverslips were mounted on glass slides with antifade reagents (Molecular Probes). Slides were monitored using a Leica TCS-NP/SP confocal microscope. For time-lapse confocal microscopy, live cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified Pe-Con environmental chamber supplied with 5% CO2.RNAi—Synthetic siRNA duplexes targeting hsSUN1 (5′-CCAUCCUGAGUAUACCUGUCUGUAU-3′) and hALP (5′-CGGCCUUCAGUGCUGUGGUGUUAUA-3′) were from Invitrogen. HeLa cells were transfected with hsSUN1 RNAi using TransMessenger transfection reagent (Qiagen). A GFP-expressing plasmid (Clontech) was co-transfected with hsSUN1 RNAi to monitor transfection efficiency. We also employed unrelated siRNAs with the same GC content as controls. 24-72 h after transfection, cells were analyzed by Western blotting or confocal microscopy.RESULTSDeterminants of hsSUN1 Localization to the Nuclear Envelope—HsSUN1 was initially described to contain 824 amino acids (13Starr D.A. Han M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, various lengths (ranging from 909 to 974 amino acids) for SUN1 (UNC84A) have been suggested (17Crisp M.

Updated sequencings (KIAA0810, clone hk05647s1) from Kazusa DNA Research Institute and from our own cloning of cDNAs (data not shown) from several human cells (Jurkat, HeLa, and primary human lymphoblastoid cells) reveal that hsSUN1 is 785 amino acids in length. At its C terminus, hsSUN1 conserves with C. elegans UNC-84 a 190-amino acid SUN domain (Fig. 1A). In silico analyses indicate that hsSUN1 has three transmembrane regions located at amino acids 239-256, 263-282, and 289-306; and two coiled-coils at positions 377-402 and 428-466 (Fig. 1A).Evidence supports that hsSUN1 is an INM protein. However, published reports do not agree on which hsSUN1 domain specifies nuclear location (17Crisp M. Liu Q. Roux K. Rattner J.B. Shanahan C. Burke B. Stahl P.D. Hodzic D. J.

To clarify structure-function relationship, we constructed several hsSUN1 deletion mutants (Fig. 1B) and expressed each in HeLa cells. We observed that hsSUN1 despite removal of amino acids 480-785 (Fig. 1C, panels 1-3, see WT, ΔC1, and ΔC2 proteins) still retained a nuclear envelope pattern indicating that hsSUN1 C terminus, including its SUN domain, is dispensable for nuclear membrane localization. When we deleted into hsSUN1 coiled-coils, as in hsSUN1 ΔC3, ∼10% of the protein partitioned from the nuclear envelope into the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C, panel 4). Further removal of all three transmembrane regions (amino acids 1-238, ΔC4; Fig. 1C, panel 5) dispersed increased amounts of hsSUN1.The above analyses were complemented with deletions starting from the N terminus. Removing the first 102 N-terminal amino acids from hsSUN1 (amino acids 103-785 ΔN1, Fig. 1C, panel 6) shifted more than 60% of the protein from the envelope into the ER. Removing the next 102 amino acids (amino acids 205-785 ΔN2, Fig. 1C, panel 7) did not cause further changes. However, when the deletion was extended to amino acid 306, hsSUN1 ΔN3 (amino acids 307-785) became wholly cytoplasmic (Fig. 1C, panel 8). Collectively, the results show hsSUN1 three putative transmembrane motifs and its first 102 N-terminal amino acids are needed for retention in the nuclear envelope.HsSUN1 Nucleates Daughter Nuclear Envelope Formation—Because antibodies are not available, we generated and affinity-purified rabbit antisera (αhsSUN1-C) to hsSUN1 C-terminal 362-785 amino acids (Fig. 2A). Using αhsSUN1-C, we first studied the distribution of cell endogenous hsSUN1. Interphase hsSUN1 stained with lamin B1 around the nucleus (Fig. 2B). In early mitosis even as the envelope commences breakdown, hsSUN1, along with lamin B1 and emerin, is found at the nuclear membrane, (Fig. 2C, panels 1-6). During this period, hsSUN1 and the nuclear pore complex (NPC, detected with mab414, which recognizes the conserved FXFG repeats in nucleoporins) are partially overlapping (Fig. 2C, panels 7-9). As the cell moves into metaphase, hsSUN1, lamin B1, and emerin disperse into the mitotic cytosol (Fig. 2D, panels 1-6) while NPC-staining with mab414 is extinguished (Fig. 2D, panels 7-9). By anaphase, hsSUN1 reorganizes around nascently separated daughter DNAs (Fig. 2E) at the peripheral edges of condensed chromosomes (see Fig. 2F; compare the locations of hsSUN1 and CENP-A). We note that as hsSUN1 reforms structurally from metaphase to anaphase NPC-staining follows co-incidentally (Fig. 2E, panels 1-3). By contrast, re-organization of anaphase lamin B1 (Fig. 2E, panels 4-6) lags initially (compare NPC and lamin B1 staining relative to α-tubulin-staining; Fig. 2E, panels 2, 5, and 8); but by telophase, lamin B1 too converges with hsSUN1 at newly reformed daughter nuclear envelopes (Fig. 2G). While other interpretations are possible, these sequential views suggest that hsSUN1 leads NPC and lamin B1 in nucleating daughter envelopes.FIGURE 2Cell cycle localization of hsSUN1.

We next queried whether the hsSUN1 association with segregated chromatids (Fig. 2E) occurs prior to or after LAP2/LBR.To assess the relative ordering of hsSUN1 and LAP2, we immunostained simultaneously cell-endogenous hsSUN1 and LAP2. HsSUN1 and LAP2 are together in interphase (Fig. 3A, panels 1-3). By metaphase, both hsSUN1 and LAP2 become dispersed (Fig. 3A, panels 4-6). In early anaphase, hsSUN1 reorganizes at the peripheral edges of chromosomes (Fig. 3A, panels 7-9) with LAP2 following later to chromosome proximal locales (Fig. 3A, panels 10-15 and Ref. (27Dechat T. Gajewski A. Korbei B. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Haraguchi T. Furukawa K. Ellenberg J. Foisner R. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6117-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)). These comparisons place hsSUN1 interaction with newly segregated chromosomes before LAP2.FIGURE 3HsSUN1 binds chromatin prior to LAP2. A, localization of hsSUN1 (green) and LAP2 (red) were compared in interphase (panels 1-3), metaphase (panels 4-6), anaphase (panels 7-12), and telophase (panels 13-15) cells. HsSUN1 appears first at the peripheral rim of separated sister chromatids, as denoted by arrows with LAP2 appearing later (indicated by arrowheads). DNA was stained with DAPI (blue). Bar, 10 μm. B, alignment of N-terminal amino acids of human and mouse SUN1. Identities are shaded in gray; conserved basic amino acids are shaded in black. The basic domains of human and mouse SUN1 are underlined. C, chromatin binding assay was performed using HeLa cells expressing transfected full-length HA-hsSUN1-WT (lane 2), HA-hsSUN1-BD (lane 4), or HA-hsSUN1-SUN (lane 5), or FLAG-BAF (lanes 7). Lanes 1, 3, and 4 are mock-transfected samples. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-HA- (lanes 1-5) or monoclonal anti-FLAG- (lanes 6 and 7) agarose beads. Histone H2B co-immunoprecipitated by HA-hsSUN1-BD or FLAG-BAF was detected by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A current notion is that LAP2/LBR forms a scaffold onto which other NE proteins coalesce to assemble a new nuclear envelope. LAP2 and LBR contain basic amino acid chromatin-binding domains (31Ulbert S. Platani M. Boue S. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because SUN1 associates with segregated chromosomes before LAP2, we wondered if SUN1 also has a chromatin-binding domain. We compared human and mouse SUN1 sequences and noted that both conserved a basic N-terminal amino acid region (hsSUN1 amino acids 40-109; musSUN1 amino acids 40-111; both pIs are 11.5, Fig. 3B). To check if this N-terminal fragment can bind chromatin, we overexpressed HA-tagged wild type full-length hsSUN1 (hsSUN1-WT) and the hsSUN1 basic domain (hsSUN1-BD, amino acids 40-173, Fig. 3C) and performed a modified chromatin precipitation assay (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). As a positive control, the known chromatin-binding protein, BAF (barrier-to-autointegration factor), was used in a parallel assay (Fig. 3C, lane 7). Indeed, full-length hsSUN1-WT and hsSUN1-BD co-precipitated histone H2B (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 4) like BAF (Fig. 3C, lane 7); by contrast, a protein containing only the hsSUN1 SUN domain (hsSUN1-SUN, amino acids 501-785) did not (Fig. 3C, lane 5). These results identify a chromatin-association domain in the N terminus of hsSUN1.Cells Depleted for hsSUN1 Have Defective Nuclear Envelope—Next, using RNAi-mediated depletion, we characterized the requirement for hsSUN1 in nuclear envelope integrity (Fig. 4A). HsSUN1-siRNA or control-siRNAi was introduced separately into cells with a nuclear-targeted green fluorescent protein (GFP). Green cells from hsSUN1-siRNA or control-siRNA transfections were compared, and hsSUN1 protein was found to be depleted from the former but not the latter (Fig. 4B, compare panel 7 to panel 2). Interestingly, whereas nuclear-targeted GFP was wholly circumscribed in the nucleus in control-RNAi cells (compare GFP to DAPI, Fig. 4B, panels 1 and 3), the GFP protein showed a whole-cell distribution in hsSUN1-RNAi cells (Fig. 4B, panels 6 and 8). This latter profile suggests a nuclear envelope defect in hsSUN1-depleted cells, which fail to retain nuclear-targeted GFP.FIGURE 4Depletion of hsSUN1 impairs nuclear envelope integrity and NPC formation. A, immunoblotting of lysates from cells treated with 0, 1, or 4 μg (lanes 1-3) of hsSUN1 siRNA and probed with αhsSUN1-C. Actin was used as a loading control. B, HeLa cells were co-transfected with a GFP-expressing plasmid and control- (panels 1-5) or hsSUN1- (panels 6-10) siRNA and immunostained with αhsSUN1-C. GFP is green; hsSUN1 is red; and DNA (DAPI) is blue. GFP-expressing cells (arrows) indicate cells transfected with siRNA. Bar, 10 μm. C, control- (panels 1-3) or hsSUN1- (panels 4-6) siRNA transfected cells were stained using αhsSUN1-C (green, panels 1 and 4) and mab414 (NPC, red, panels 2 and 5). DAPI (blue) was used to visualize DNA. Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To independently check nuclear envelope integrity, we stained for NPC. In control cells, NPC staining was seen appropriately in anaphase (Fig. 4C, panels 1-3; Refs. 32Hetzer M.W. Walther T.C. Mattaj I.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 347-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 33Margalit A. Vlcek S. Gruenbaum Y. Foisner R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 454-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By contrast, hsSUN1-RNAi cells were absent for hsSUN1 and showed failed NPC staining/reorganization at the edges of segregated DNA masses in anaphase (Fig. 4C, panels 4-6, arrow-heads). Hence, hsSUN1 appears to be required in anaphase for NPC formation; failed NPC assembly may explain the inability of nuclear envelope to retain nuclear-GFP (Fig. 4B, panels 6 and 9).hsSUN1-depleted Cells Have Delayed Chromosome Decondensation—Two events occur at the end of mitosis: daughter nuclei form and chromosomes de-condense. Currently, it is unclear whether these two events are linked. To ask if the daughter nuclear envelope reassembly influences DNA de-condensation, we visualized chromosome segregation in control and hsSUN1 RNAi cells. We digitized signals from DAPI-stained chromosomes using heightened colored intensities to reflect increased DNA compaction (Fig. 5A, panels 4 and 8). By this measure, control-RNAi cells compared with hsSUN1-RNAi cells at the same juncture during cell division (as monitored by α-tubulin staining) had consistently lower DAPI intensity (see Fig. 5A, panels 4 and 8; the averaged fluorescent intensity is 2.7 times lower in panel 4 than panel 8). Thus, hsSUN1 depletion affects nuclear envelope integrity (Fig. 4B) and results in an apparent increase in DNA compaction (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5Knockdown of hsSUN1 prolonged chromatin condensation with hypoacetylated histones.

https://openalex.org/W2055802125,"Induction of the yeast <i>PHO5</i> and <i>PHO8</i> genes leads to a prominent chromatin transition at their promoter regions as a prerequisite for transcription activation. Although induction of <i>PHO8</i> is strictly dependent on Snf2 and Gcn5, there is no chromatin remodeler identified so far that would be essential for the opening of <i>PHO5</i> promoter chromatin. Nonetheless, the nonessential but significant involvement of cofactors can be identified if the chromatin opening kinetics are delayed in the respective mutants. Using this approach, we have tested individually all 15 viable Snf2 type ATPase deletion mutants for their effect on <i>PHO5</i> promoter induction and opening. Only the absence of Snf2 and Ino80 showed a strong delay in chromatin remodeling kinetics. The <i>snf2 ino80</i> double mutation had a synthetic kinetic effect but eventually still allowed strong <i>PHO5</i> induction. The same was true for the <i>snf2 gcn5</i> and <i>ino80 gcn5</i> double mutants. This strongly suggests a complex network of redundant and mutually independent parallel pathways that lead to the remodeling of the <i>PHO5</i> promoter. Further, chromatin remodeling kinetics at a transcriptionally inactive TATA box-mutated <i>PHO5</i> promoter were affected neither under wild type conditions nor in the absence of Snf2 or Gcn5. This demonstrates the complete independence of promoter chromatin opening from downstream <i>PHO5</i> transcription processes. Finally, the histone variant Htz1 has no prominent role for the kinetics of <i>PHO5</i> promoter chromatin remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W1986342700,"Redox regulation has been shown to be of increasing importance for many cellular processes. Here, redox homeostasis was addressed in Aspergillus nidulans, an important model organism for fundamental biological questions such as development, gene regulation or the regulation of the production of secondary metabolites. We describe the characterization of a thioredoxin system from the filamentous fungus A. nidulans. The A. nidulans thioredoxin A (AnTrxA) is an 11.6-kDa protein with a characteristic thioredoxin active site motif (WCGPC) encoded by the trxA gene. The corresponding thioredoxin reductase (AnTrxR), encoded by the trxR gene, represents a homodimeric flavoprotein with a native molecular mass of 72.2 kDa. When combined in vitro, the in Escherichia coli overproduced recombinant proteins AnTrxA and AnTrxR were able to reduce insulin and oxidized glutathione in an NADPH-dependent manner indicating that this in vitro redox system is functional. Moreover, we have created a thioredoxin A deletion strain that shows decreased growth, an increased catalase activity, and the inability to form reproductive structures like conidiophores or cleistothecia when cultivated under standard conditions. However, addition of GSH at low concentrations led to the development of sexual cleistothecia, whereas high GSH levels resulted in the formation of asexual conidiophores. Furthermore, by applying the principle of thioredoxin-affinity chromatography we identified several novel putative targets of thioredoxin A, including a hypothetical protein with peroxidase activity and an aldehyde dehydrogenase.

Due to the metabolism of molecular oxygen as the final electron acceptor of the respiratory chain, all aerobic organisms are exposed to reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). 2The abbreviations used are:ROIreactive oxygen intermediateTrxthioredoxinTrxRthioredoxin reductaseAMMAspergillus minimal mediumAnTrxAA. nidulans thioredoxin AAnTrxRA. nidulans thioredoxin reductaseDTTdithiothreitolGSSGoxidized glutathionePrxperoxiredoxinALDHaldehyde dehydrogenaseDTNB or NBS25,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) Whereas low concentrations of ROI are supposed to function as secondary messengers, elevated ROI levels can lead to damage of biological macromolecules, like DNA, lipids, and proteins. However, there are several enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense mechanisms that are able to detoxify ROI efficiently. These mechanisms include superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxidases, and the tripeptide glutathione. Glutathione is the most abundant intracellular thiol compound and serves as a powerful antioxidant and radical scavenger. Another important redox system is formed by the thioredoxin system. Thioredoxin systems are composed of two enzymes, i.e. thioredoxin (Trx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) (1Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thioredoxins are small, ubiquitously distributed proteins with a molecular mass of 12–13 kDa. Due to their redox-active cysteine pair in the active site (WCGPC), they are able to cycle between their oxidized disulfide (Trx-S2) and reduced dithiol [Trx-(SH)2] forms. In an NADPH-dependent protein disulfide reduction reaction TrxR catalyzes the reduction of oxidized thioredoxin using NADPH as electron donor, its own redox-active cysteine pair and FAD as cofactor. Reduced Trx directly reduces the disulfide in the target protein. This NADPH-dependent disulfide reduction mechanism is required for several intracellular processes. Since the discovery of the first Escherichia coli Trx, which was shown to be involved in DNA synthesis by acting as an electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase (3Laurent T.C. Moore E.C. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3436-3444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a number of Trx target proteins were identified. Until now, the physiological functions assigned to Trx include protein disulfide reduction, sulfur assimilation, detoxification of reactive oxygen species, protein repair and redox regulation of enzymes and transcription factors. Also, regulatory effects of Trx on apoptosis as well as co-cytokine-, chemokine-, and growth-stimulating activities have been discussed (reviewed in Ref. 4Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). reactive oxygen intermediate thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase Aspergillus minimal medium A. nidulans thioredoxin A A. nidulans thioredoxin reductase dithiothreitol oxidized glutathione peroxiredoxin aldehyde dehydrogenase 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) TrxRs are members of the larger family of pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases, which also includes enzymes like glutathione reductase, mercuric reductase, and lipoamide dehydrogenase (5Ghisla S. Massey V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Two classes of TrxRs have evolved, i.e. the low molecular weight TrxRs found in prokaryotes, archaea, plants, and fungi, and the high molecular weight TrxRs present in higher eukaryotes. Both classes have certain features in common. They are homodimeric flavoenzymes containing a redox active disulfide and binding sites for FAD and NADPH in each subunit (6Williams Jr., C.H. Arscott L.D. Müller S. Lennon B.W. Ludwig M.L. Wang P.-F. Veine D.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6110-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 7Moore E.C. Reichard P. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3445-3452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The basis of their reaction mechanism is the transfer of reducing equivalents from NADPH to an active disulfide by using FAD as cofactor (8Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). However, low molecular mass TrxRs are homodimers of 35–36 kDa subunits, whereas the high molecular mass TrxRs from higher eukaryotes are composed of two subunits with a molecular mass of 55–58 kDa. In contrast to low molecular mass TrxRs, high molecular mass TrxRs possess an additional redox active site in the C-terminal extension, which is responsible for the interaction with the substrate Trx (6Williams Jr., C.H. Arscott L.D. Müller S. Lennon B.W. Ludwig M.L. Wang P.-F. Veine D.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6110-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 9Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The rapidly growing literature on thioredoxin reductases, thioredoxins, and redox-regulated proteins indicates the deep impact of oxidoreductase systems on cellular processes. In microbial eukaryotes, ROIs are involved in development, cell differentiation (10Aguirre J. Rios-Momberg M. Hewitt D. Hansberg W. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), and host-pathogen interaction (11Aguirre J. Hansberg W. Navarro R. Med. Mycol. 2006; 44: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Also, a possible role of oxidoreductase systems in the penicillin biosynthesis has been discussed for Penicillium chrysogenum and Streptomyces clavuligerus (12Aharonowitz Y. Av-Gay Y. Schreiber R. Cohen G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 623-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cohen G. Argaman A. Schreiber R. Mislovati M. Aharonowitz Y. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 973-984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the isolation and characterization of a thioredoxin system from A. nidulans, which is an important model organism to study all kinds of biological questions, including development and the production of secondary metabolites (14Brakhage A.A. Al-Abdallah Q. Tüncher A. Spröte P. Phytochemistry. 2005; 66: 1200-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As shown here, the thioredoxin system is essential for development of A. nidulans, and novel target proteins of thioredoxin were identified. Furthermore, the in vitro and in vivo data indicate that this thioredoxin system possesses a key role in the redox regulation of A. nidulans, because correlations with other redox systems, such as catalases, the glutathione system, and a thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase seem to exist. Strains and Molecular Genetic Techniques—Bacterial and fungal strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. A detailed oligonucleotide description can be found in the supplemental data (Table S1). Standard techniques in the manipulation of DNA were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from A. nidulans mycelia, grown for 24–48 h in Aspergillus minimal medium (AMM), was isolated by using the MasterPure™ Yeast DNA purification kit from Biozym Scientific (Oldendorf, Germany) according to a modified isolation protocol (16Wickes B.

Van den Brulle J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2781-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If required, uridine (1 g/liter), p-aminobenzoic acid (3 mg/liter), riboflavin (2.5 mg/liter), pyridoxine-HCl (500 mg/liter), or reduced glutathione (307 mg/liter to 30.7 g/liter) was added to the medium. Isolation of Total RNA—A. nidulans strain AXB4A2 was grown at 37 °C in AMM supplemented with p-aminobenzoic acid and uridine. Mycelia were harvested, and cell extracts were obtained using liquid nitrogen as previously described (18Litzka O. Then Bergh K. Brakhage A.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen following the “RNeasy Mini Protocol for Isolation of Total RNA from Plant Cells and Tissues and Filamentous Fungi.” Aliquots (1–2 μg) of total RNA were used for the synthesis of AnTrxA-cDNA and AnTrxR-cDNA, as described in the following section. Synthesis of AnTrxA-cDNA and AnTrxR-cDNA—AnTrxA-cDNA was synthesized with the gene-specific primers AnTrxAf and AnTrxA-His6r by using the BioScript™ One-Step RT-PCR kit from Bioline (Luckenwalde, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. AnTrxR-cDNA was synthesized by using the gene-specific primers AnTrxR-His6f and AnTrxRr. Generation of Recombinant Plasmids for AnTrxA and AnTrxR Overproduction—For the overproduction of the C-terminal His-tagged AnTrxA(wt) fusion protein AnTrxA-cDNA was cloned into the NdeI-NcoI site of the pET-39b(+) vector (Novagen) to generate the plasmid pET39-AnTrxA(wt)-H6. For the overproduction of the C-terminally His-tagged AnTrxA(C39S) fusion protein a cysteine residue (Cys-39) in AnTrxA(wt) was replaced by a two-step PCR amplification technique, as described by Ho et al. (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using pET39-AnTrxA(wt)-H6 as template and the primers AnTrxC39Sf and AnTrxC39Sr for mutagenesis. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned into the NdeI-NcoI site of the pET-39b(+) vector to generate the plasmid pET39-AnTrxA(C39S)-H6. For the overproduction of the N-terminally His-tagged AnTrxR fusion protein AnTrxR-cDNA was cloned into the NdeI-HindIII site of the pET-39b(+) vector to generate the plasmid pET39-H6-AnTrxR. The DNA sequence of the inserts was verified by sequence analysis. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The recombinant soluble His6-tagged proteins AnTrxA(wt), AnTrxA(C39S), and AnTrxR were overproduced and purified by Ni2+ chelate and anion exchange chromatography, as described elsewhere (20Hortschansky P. Eisendle M. Al-Abdallah Q. Schmidt A.D. Bergmann S. Thön M. Kniemeyer O. Abt B. Seeber B. Werner E.R. Kato M. Brakhage A.A. Haas H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3086-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For storage at -20 °C, the recombinant AnTrxA(wt), AnTrxA(C39S), and AnTrxR proteins were transferred into 50% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), using a HiPrep desalting column (GE Healthcare, Freiberg, Germany). Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using the Coomassie Plus™ protein assay reagent (Pierce). Purity and Molecular Weight Determination—The purity and molecular weights of the recombinant proteins were determined by SDS-PAGE. In addition, the AnTrxA(wt) and AnTrxR proteins were subjected to gel filtration using a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a buffer containing 100 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. FAD Content and Reconstitution of the AnTrxR Holo-enzyme with FAD—The concentration of enzyme-bound FAD was determined by measuring the absorbance at 454 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 11.3 mm-1 × cm-1 for FAD (22Williams Jr., C.H. Zanetti G. Arscott L.D. McAllister K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5226-5231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the high production levels of AnTrxR in E. coli BL21(DE3) and the following purification procedures, the majority of the enzyme was present as an apo-enzyme. To reconstitute the AnTrxR holo-enzyme for further characterization, AnTrxR was incubated with a 60-fold molar excess of FAD for 20 min before adding on a NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare) to remove the excess of FAD. Thioredoxin Reductase Activity—TrxR activity of the purified AnTrxR was determined by using two different methods. In the NBS2 reduction assay AnTrxR activity was determined by the NADPH-dependent reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (23Arnér E.S. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). One enzyme unit is defined as the NADPH-dependent production of 2 μmol of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (ϵ412 nm = 2 × 13.6 mm-1 × cm-1) per min. TrxR activity was also assayed based on the ability of AnTrxR to reduce AnTrxA(wt), which then reduces insulin disulfide bridges (24Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AnTrxR activity was calculated from the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm-1 × cm-1 for NADPH. One enzyme unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that leads to the consumption of 1 μmol of NADPH per minute. Trx Activity—Trx activity was determined by using the TrxR-dependent insulin precipitation assay (24Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After starting the reaction by the addition of NADPH, the NADPH consumption was followed by recording the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, until turbidity appeared. The increase of turbidity was measured at 650 nm. Trx-dependent GSSG Reduction Assay—The Trx-dependent GSSG-reduction assay was carried out as described elsewhere (25Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. Türbachova I. Iozef R. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40180-40186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). After addition of NADPH, the activity was calculated from the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Transformation of A. nidulans and Generation of trxA Deletion and Complemented Strains—As a parental strain for gene deletion, the uracil auxotrophic strain TN02A7 (ΔnkuA) was used (26Nayak T. Szewczyk E. Oakley C.E. Osmani A. Ukil L. Murray S.L. Hynes M.J. Osmani S.A. Oakley B.R. Genetics. 2006; 172: 1557-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). As a selectable marker, the pyr-4 gene, encoding orotidine-5′-monophosphate decarboxylase from Neurospora crassa, was applied. The trxA gene, including 1500-bp up-stream and downstream flanking regions, was amplified from genomic DNA of the wild-type strain AXB4A2 by the use of the oligonucleotides TrxA1500for and TrxA1500rev. The PCR product was cloned into the PCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) to yield plasmid pAnTrxA-FLANK. Plasmid DNA of pAnTrxA-FLANK was cut with ClaI and BmgBI (blunt end cutter) to release a 1606-bp fragment, including the complete trxA gene, 650 bp of the upstream region, and 552 bp of the downstream region. For the introduction of the pyr-4 gene, plasmid DNA of pKTB (27Spröte P. Brakhage A.A. Arch. Microbiol. 2007; 188: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was restricted with ClaI and PvuII (blunt end cutter). The resulting pyr-4-containing DNA fragment was then ligated with the ClaI- and BmgBI-restricted pAnTrxA-FLANK vector backbone to give plasmid pAnTrxAKO. Plasmid pAnTrxAKO was digested with NsiI and Acc65I to remove the PCR2.1 vector backbone. After gel purification (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Qiagen) the DNA fragment was directly used for transformation of A. nidulans TN02A7 (ΔnkuA) as previously described (28Weidner G. d'Enfert C. Koch A. Mol P.C. Brakhage A.A. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Transformants were pre-screened for their ability to sporulate on AMM agar plates containing 20 mm reduced glutathione and their inability to sporulate on AMM-agar plates without reduced glutathione. Genomic DNA of putative trxA deletion strains was subjected to Southern blot analysis. Complementation experiments were carried out by transformation of strain AnTrxAKO with a trxA-encoding PCR product, including 1.5-kb upstream and downstream flanking regions. Genomic DNA of transformants that behaved like the wild type was subjected to Southern blot analysis. For detection of DNA fragments, the digoxigenin system (Roche Applied Science) was used. Trx-affinity Chromatography—5 mg of AnTrxA(C39S) were coupled to a Hi-Trap NHS-activated 1-ml affinity column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A. nidulans mycelia of the wild-type strain TN02A7 and the trxA deletion strain AnTrxAKO were ground in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle. The powder was resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min) the soluble protein-containing supernatants were applied to the prepared thioredoxin-affinity column by injection at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 100 mm potassium phosphate and 250 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, at 1 ml/min. Elution was carried out with 100 mm potassium phosphate containing 10 mm DTT, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. Aliquots of the supernatants, flow-through, wash, and elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Identification of AnTrxA Targets—Protein bands of the elution fraction were excised manually and digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Peptides were extracted as described (29Kniemeyer O. Lessing F. Scheibner O. Hertweck C. Brakhage A.A. Curr. Genet. 2006; 49: 178-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and peptide mass fingerprint and fragmentation data were collected on a Bruker ultraflex TOF/TOF using Bruker Compass 1.2 software (FlexControl/FlexAnalysis 3.0). Obtained peak lists were sent to a Mascot in-house server (version 2.1.03) with the current NCBInr data base for protein identification. Search parameters were set as follows: mass tolerance of 200 ppm for peptide mass fingerprint and 0.5 Da for fragmentation, maximum of one missed cleavage by trypsin, taxonomy “fungi,” fixed carbamidomethyl modification, and optional methionine oxidation. The most significant hits were verified by comparison with the combined peptide mass fingerprint/fragmentation spectrum. With the chosen settings protein scores of >67 are significant (p < 0.05). Trx-dependent Peroxidase Activity—The elution fractions of AnTrx(C39S) affinity-purified protein solutions were applied to a NAP-10 column to remove the excess of DTT. Then aliquots of the DTT-free protein solution in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, were incubated with or without the recombinant A. nidulans thioredoxin system and 200 μm NADPH. After addition of H2O2, the activity was calculated from the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Hydrogen Peroxide Sensitivity Assay—1.5 × 108 spores of the strains TN02A7 and AnTrxAKO were inoculated in 30 ml of liquid AMM agar (2% w/v) containing 0 mm, 1 mm, and 20 mm GSH. After the agar became solidified a hole of 1 cm in diameter in the center of the agar plate was created and filled with 150 μl of a 4.5% (v/v) H2O2 solution. The agar plates were incubated at 37 °C, and the zone of growth inhibition was measured after 48 h. Catalase Activity—A. nidulans mycelia and freshly harvested spores of the strains TN02A7 and AnTrxAKO were ground in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle. The obtained powder was resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min) the soluble protein extracts were diluted in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, to a final concentration of 5–50 μg of protein × ml-1. After adding H2O2 (20 mm) the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm was measured. Catalase activity was calculated from the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 0.0436 mm-1 × cm-1 for H2O2 (30Beers R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Catalase activity was also investigated by zymography (31Goldberg I. Hochman A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 991: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cloning and Sequence Analysis of the trxA and trxR Genes from A. nidulans—Two genes with the accession numbers XM_652682 and XM_656093 have been annotated to encode a classic cytoplasmatic thioredoxin (TrxA) and a hypothetical protein similar to thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), respectively. By using gene-specific primers for the reverse transcription and cDNA synthesis of the gene encoded by XM_652682, a DNA fragment was synthesized encoding a sequence identical to the deposited trxA cDNA. The deduced AnTrxA protein contains the thioredoxin-specific active site motif WCGPC and further highly conserved amino acids (see sequence alignment with other thioredoxins in supplemental Fig. S1A). AnTrxA exhibits all the characteristics of thioredoxins and represents the A. nidulans thioredoxin sequence (accession number AAB24444) described earlier (32Le Marechal P. Hoang B.M. Schmitter J.-M. Van Dorsselaer A. Decottignies P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here, by reverse transcription of the gene designated with accession number XM_656093, we identified a shorter cDNA version for the A. nidulans thioredoxin reductase (accession number AM396558). This coding sequence is identical to an updated version of the trxR coding sequence deposited in the A. nidulans data base (AN3581.3). It contains a putative FAD-binding domain formed by the GXGXX(A/G) motif in the N-terminal region and the TXXXXVFAAGD motif at the C terminus of the protein (33Jeon S.J. Ishikawa K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5423-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Serrato A.J. Pérez-Ruiz J.M. Cejudo F.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). An NADPH-binding domain was also identified near the middle of the protein encoded by the motif GGGXXA (33Jeon S.J. Ishikawa K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5423-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Serrato A.J. Pérez-Ruiz J.M. Cejudo F.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it contains the pyridine-nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductases class-II active site motif, including a redox-active cysteine pair (CAVC). This motif was found by a pattern search using the “PROSITE data base of protein families and domains” (http://www.expasy.org/prosite/). The motif is characteristic of prokaryotic and eukaryotic thioredoxin reductases (8Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 9Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 35Kuriyan J. Krishna T.S.

(Tokyo). 1991; 109: 678-683Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and a probable oxidoreductase encoded by the Clostridium pasteurianum rubredoxin operon (39Mathieu I. Meyer J. Moulis J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). An alignment of AnTrxR with other low molecular weight thioredoxin reductases can be found in the supplemental data (Fig. S1B). Both AnTrxA(wt) and AnTrxR were overproduced as His-tagged proteins in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified to homogeneity. Additionally, an AnTrxA mutant version (AnTrxA(C39S)) was created, which had the second cysteine of the AnTrxA active site substituted by serine (Cys-39 → Ser-39). SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified proteins showed molecular masses of 12.7 and 37.6 kDa for AnTrxA and AnTrxR, respectively (Fig. 1A). After subtracting the molecular mass due to the His tag, the molecular masses of both proteins are in agreement with the values deduced from the respective cDNA sequences. The data obtained by gel filtration revealed apparent native molecular masses of 12.9 kDa for the AnTrxA(wt) and 88.0 kDa for the AnTrxR protein (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that, without the His tag, the native AnTrxA is a monomer of 11.6 kDa, whereas the native AnTrxR is a homodimer of 72.2 kDa. Consequently, the concentrations of AnTrxR given in the following refer to the homodimer. AnTrxR Is a Flavoenzyme—Both the sequence analysis and the yellow color of the purified AnTrxR led to the assumption that the enzyme is a flavoenzyme. Consistently, the UV-visible absorbance spectrum of the reconstituted AnTrxR holo-enzyme with absorbance maxima at 280, 380, and 460 nm and an absorbance ratio A280:A460 of 7.6 (Fig. 1C) is characteristic of a pure thioredoxin reductase with one FAD molecule per subunit (33Jeon S.J. Ishikawa K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5423-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 40Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The creation of the reduced form of AnTrxR by adding a12 m excess of NADPH resulted in a decreased absorbance at 460 nm (Fig. 1D). TrxR Substrate Specificity—For the determination of the kinetic parameters of the AnTrxR protein, we used the NBS2, insulin, and GSSG reduction assays, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Cys-39 → Ser-39 substitution in the active site led to an AnTrxA mutant protein (AnTrxA(C39S)), which was unable to cycle between its oxidized disulfide (Trx-S2) and reduced dithiol [Trx-(SH)2] form. Thus, this mutant protein did not serve as a substrate"
https://openalex.org/W1992116057,"Copper is essential for human growth and survival. Enterocytes mediate the absorption of dietary copper from the intestinal lumen into blood as well as utilizing copper for their biosynthetic needs. Currently, the pathways for copper entry into enterocytes remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that the basolateral copper uptake into intestinal cells greatly exceeds the apical uptake. The basolateral but not apical transport is mediated by the high affinity copper transporter hCTR1. This unanticipated conclusion is supported by cell surface biotinylation and confocal microscopy of endogenous hCTR1 in Caco2 cells as well as copper influx measurements that show saturable high affinity uptake at the basolateral but not the apical membrane. Basolateral localization of hCTR1 and polarized copper uptake are also conserved in T84 cells, models for intestinal crypt cells. The lateral localization of hCTR1 seen in intestinal cell lines is recapitulated in immunohistochemical staining of mouse intestinal sections. Biochemical and functional assays reveal the basolateral localization of hCTR1 also in renal Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and opossum kidney cells. Overexpression of hCTR1 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells results in both apical and basolateral delivery of the overexpressed protein and greatly enhanced copper uptake at both cell surfaces. We propose a model of intestinal copper uptake in which basolateral hCTR1 plays a key role in the physiologically important delivery of copper from blood to intracellular proteins, whereas its role in the initial apical uptake of dietary copper is indirect.

We propose a model of intestinal copper uptake in which basolateral hCTR1 plays a key role in the physiologically important delivery of copper from blood to intracellular proteins, whereas its role in the initial apical uptake of dietary copper is indirect. Copper is required by higher eukaryotes, including mammals, for a variety of metabolic processes, for mitochondrial respiration as an essential cofactor in cytochromes, in the synthesis of collagen and the production of connective tissue and skin, and in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and brain peptides as well as in protection against reactive oxygen species in cells and tissues by virtue of its catalytic involvement in superoxide dismutase. At the same time, elevated levels of copper are toxic, as a result of its redox chemistry and its propensity to form stable adducts with protein sulfhydryl residues. Thus, most organisms have developed a series of sophisticated mechanisms to regulate the acquisition and excretion of this metal. About 1-2 mg of copper is delivered to humans in their daily diet to be absorbed in the intestine or excreted, largely in the feces (1Linder M.C. Hazegh-Azam M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 63,: 797S-811SPubMed Google Scholar). Copper uptake in eukaryotes is mediated by CTR proteins that were first characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76,: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 3Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269,: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In humans high affinity copper entry is mediated largely by hCTR1, the human copper transporter. hCTR1 was first cloned and its sequence determined in 1997 (4Zhou B. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94,: 7481-7486Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The mouse homolog, mCTR1, is 92% identical to hCtr1 (5Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Dagenais S.L. Glover T.W. Thiele D.J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254,: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Deletion of mCTR1 results in embryonic lethality, death occurring in utero in midgestation, around E9.5 (6Kuo Y.M. Zhou B. Cosco D. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98,: 6836-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 7Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98,: 6842-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). hCTR1 is a small, methionine-rich protein (190 amino acid residues) that has three transmembrane segments and oligomerizes to form functional trimers that most likely cooperate to form a specific ion pathway for copper across the membrane (8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277,: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 9Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280,: 9635-9639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The complex mediates copper uptake with a Km value in the 2-5 μm range. However, it is clear that other systems may be involved in cellular copper entry, as ctr1-/- mouse fibroblasts still carry out copper uptake at about 20-30% that of the rate of normal cells (13Lee J. Petris M.J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277,: 40253-40259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Candidates for other copper uptake pathways include DMT1, the relatively nonspecific divalent cation transporter that has been shown to transport copper (14Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388,: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2653) Google Scholar, 15Arredondo M. Munoz P. Mura C.V. Nunez M.T. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284,: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Copper exit and delivery of cellular copper into the secretory pathway of cells is accomplished by the ATP-dependent copper transporters, ATP7A and ATP7B, which are members of the P-type ATPase family (16Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34,: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). These are two intrinsic membrane proteins that utilize the energy of hydrolysis of ATP to fuel the transport of copper across cell membranes (17Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191,: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Disruption of ATP7A or ATP7B leads to the two human genetic diseases, Menkes and Wilson diseases, respectively. In polarized epithelia of the intestine and kidney, reabsorptive transepithelial transport of ions and nutrients is accomplished by separating the entry step (from the lumen into the cells) from the exit step from the cells into the blood. This is done by the exclusive localization of entry mechanisms to the apical surface and of exit mechanisms to the basolateral surface. Such polarization is an essential property of epithelia and is maintained by the presence of tight junctions between epithelial cells. In keeping with this well established model it has been supposed that major copper entry mechanisms will be limited to the apical epithelial membrane and P-type ATPases to the basolateral side (18Tennant J. Stansfield M. Yamaji S. Srai S.K. Sharp P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527,: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The two major candidates so far identified for mediating copper uptake are DMT1, a nonspecific divalent cation transporter, shown to be at the apical surface of human intestinal epithelial cells (19Tandy S. Williams M. Leggett A. Lopez-Jimenez M. Dedes M. Ramesh B. Srai S.K. Sharp P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275,: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and hCTR1. It has also been argued that whereas hCTR1 may be responsible for copper uptake in the brain, its involvement in dietary copper uptake in intestinal tissue remains uncertain (20Sharp P.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35,: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported after immunohistochemical staining of tissue that hCTR1 is present in intracellular locations in mouse intestine (21Nose Y. Kim B.E. Thiele D.J. Cell Metab. 2006; 4,: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 22Kuo Y.M. Gybina A.A. Pyatskowit J.W. Gitschier J. Prohaska J.R. J. Nutr. 2006; 136,: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and perhaps at the apical surface of intestinal cells (21Nose Y. Kim B.E. Thiele D.J. Cell Metab. 2006; 4,: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this latter study, when hCTR1 was selectively disrupted in mouse intestine, cellular intestinal levels of copper were elevated rather than lowered. In another recent study it was reported that hCTR1 in both placental tissue and a placental cell line was found both in the cytoplasm and at the lateral membrane (23Hardman B. Manuelpillai U. Wallace E.M. Monty J.F. Kramer D.R. Kuo Y.M. Mercer J.F. Ackland M.L. Placenta. 2006; 27,: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of these different locations on copper uptake have not previously been reported. In the present work we utilize Caco2 cells, a well established model for enterocytes, T84 cells (an intestinal crypt cell model), and also MDCK 2The abbreviations used are: MDCKMadin-Darby canine kidney cellsOKopossum kidneyDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumΩohmsFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered saline.2The abbreviations used are: MDCKMadin-Darby canine kidney cellsOKopossum kidneyDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumΩohmsFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered saline. and OK renal cell lines that represent cells from the distal and proximal nephron, respectively. Measurements of copper entry demonstrate a saturable high affinity uptake from the basolateral but not apical cell surface. Confocal imaging and cell surface biotinylation confirm the basolateral localization of hCTR1 in these cells. Evidently, intestinal cells acquire their essential copper for intracellular processes from the blood as do other cells and must utilize an alternative uptake mechanism to carry out the absorption of dietary copper.

Cell Cultures—Cell cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere in growth media supplemented with an antibiotic-antimycotic mixture of 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone (Invitrogen #15240), 5 μg/ml Plasmocin (InvivoGen #ant-mpt), and 15 mm Hepes buffer (Invitrogen #15140). All cells were subcultured at 1:5 ratios, except for T84 cells, which were subcultured at a 1:2 ratio; growth media were exchanged twice per week. Specifically, Caco2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) medium (Invitrogen #11995) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals #s11550), T84 cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen #11765) supplemented with 5% FBS, whereas, MDCK and OK cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For generation of tetracycline-regulated MDCK cell lines that stably express the C-terminal-tagged FLAG-hCTR1, we used a Flip-In Invitrogen system (catalog #K6010). Briefly, MDCK cells were transfected with pFRT/lacZeo to create a Zeocine-resistant, Flip-In host cell line. Next, pcDNA5/FRT vector containing a FLAG-tagged hctr1 construct was co-transfected with pOG44 plasmid into the MDCK Flip-In host cell line and selected for hygromycin resistance. To convey tetracycline regulation, the hygromycin-resistant cells were then transfected with a regulatory plasmid, pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen #V1025) and selected for Blasticidin resistance. In the absence of tetracycline, a Tet repressor protein expressed from pcDNA6/TR vector represses transcription of the hctr1 gene, whose expression is induced upon the addition of tetracycline. Antibodies—The affinity-purified rabbit anti-hCTR1 antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide (SWKKAVVVDITEHCH) was described previously (9Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277,: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The anti-hCTR1 antibodies described here were raised against a 46-amino peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic loop (KIARESLLRKSQVSIRYNSMPVPGPNGTILMETHKTVGQQMLSFPH) purchased from Biopeptide Co., LLC (San Diego, CA). This peptide was used to immunize rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA). Preimmune and immune sera were tested for reactivity against the immunizing peptides, against purified hCTR1 expressed in yeast (a kind gift from Dr. V. Unger, Yale University), and against membranes from various cells expressing hCTR1. For affinity purification of antibody, hCTR1 cytoplasmic loop peptide was coupled to Actigel ALD resin matrix using instructions provided by the manufacturer (Sterogene, Carlsbad, CA). Post-coupled resin was washed and packed into columns and used to purify anti-hCTR1 antibody from whole rabbit sera. Bound antibody was eluted with Actisep elution medium (Sterogene), which was subsequently removed by desalting into PBS. The antibody was concentrated to the original serum volume in spin concentrators (Vivascience AG, Hanover Germany) and stored in 0.05% azide. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cells were grown on 24-mm polyester membrane Transwells with 0.4-μm pores (Corning, #3450) until confluent. Caco2 cells were grown on membranes that were coated with collagen (Sigma #C8919) and diluted 1:100 in 70% ethanol, and then Transwells were dried for ∼2h. When the cells were confluent, the growth medium was exchanged every 1-2 days. Formation of tight junctions was monitored by the measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance using an EVOM meter and STX2 electrodes (World Precision Instruments). Cells were judged to be ready for biotinylation when the transepithelial electrical resistance value was ∼250 Ω× cm2 for Caco2, ∼2500 Ω× cm2 for T84, ∼4000 Ω× cm2 for MDCK, ∼2000 Ω× cm2 for OK cells. Before biotinylation cells were placed on ice for ∼10 min, and all the subsequent steps were done on ice with all the solutions pre-chilled to ∼4 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mm MgCl2. EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin reagent (Pierce #21331) was diluted into a biotinylation buffer (PBS, pH 7.5, supplemented with 10 mm triethanolamine, 2 mm CaCl2, and 150 mm NaCl) to the working concentration of 0.8 mg/ml. An aliquot of 0.5 ml of the biotin reagent was added to the apical compartment, keeping the basolateral compartment filled with buffer, or 1.5 ml of the biotin reagent was added to the basolateral compartment, keeping the apical compartment filled with buffer only. Plates were incubated on ice with a slow rocking motion. The reaction was quenched by replacing the biotinylation solution with 1 ml of apical and 2 ml of basolateral quench buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm glycine) and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min with a slow rocking motion. The quenching procedure was repeated once more. Then quench buffer was removed, and the permeable membrane was excised from the Transwell with a scalpel. The membrane was placed in a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube with 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and incubated at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation for 1 h. The permeable membrane was removed, and samples were vortexed briefly and spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. An aliquot of 50 μl was taken for Western blot analysis of the total cell lysate. 700 μl of the sample was placed into a Zeba spin column (Pierce #89868), and 100 μl of streptavidin-coupled Sepharose beads (Pierce #20349) was added. Samples were incubated overnight with end-over-end rotation in the cold room, they were then spun down at 500 × g for 5 min to remove buffer, and the beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, twice with salt wash buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5), and once with buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The final spin to remove buffer was at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Biotinylated protein was eluted from the streptavidin-coupled beads with 50 μl of 2× sample buffer (working concentration of 80 mmdl-dithiothreitol, 5.6% SDS, 0.008% bromphenol blue, 16% glycerol, and 240 mm Tris, pH 8.9). Mini spin columns were placed into fresh 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes, and samples were incubated at room temperature overnight. Final elution step was done by spinning samples for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Confocal Microscopy—Cells were seeded onto permeable membranes in 1.12-cm2 Transwells (Corning #3460) and grown until ∼95% confluence. They were then washed in PBS and fixed on ice in -20 °C acetone for 30 s and then re-hydrated in PBS for 10min. Cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% gelatin in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies, rabbit anti-loop hCTR1 (1:100), and mouse anti-β1 (1:500 dilution, Affinity Bioreagents #MA3-930) were diluted in the blocking buffer and simultaneously applied for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, cells were washed 3 times with PBS, and secondary antibodies, diluted in the blocking buffer, were applied sequentially for 30 min at room temperature, with three PBS washes between each addition and after the final treatment. We used AlexaFluor 488 anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes #A11001) at a 1:800 dilution and cy3 anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-165-146) at 1:800 dilution. Membranes were then placed on a glass slide with cells facing upward, and a drop of mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vectashield #H-1200) was applied. A cover glass was placed over the cells and sealed with nail polish. Confocal images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal microscope with a multi-track configuration applied to collect tricolor images. The primary dichroic mirror HFT 405/488/543 was used in all tracks. In track 1, we used a laser beam of 543 nm to excite Cy3 fluorophore, and all of its emitted light was collected with a long pass filter 560 and detected in one channel. To detect signal from AlexaFluor 488, a laser beam of 488 nm was used for excitation. Light emitted by this fluorophore passed through the secondary dichroic mirror NFT 515 and a band pass filter (505-530 nm) before it was detected in a second channel. The third channel was used for fluorescence produced by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (excited with 405 nm laser beam). Light emitted by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole passed through the secondary dichroic mirror NFT 490 and a filter (band pass 420-480 nm) to be detected in the third channel. Immunohistochemistry—Sections of mouse intestine fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin were a generous gift from Dr. Angela L. Tyner (University of Illinois in Chicago). Tissues were deparaffinized with xylenes (Fisher #X3P-1GAL) and a graded alcohol series followed by antigen retrieval in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 20 min at a subboiling temperature, and cooling for 30 min at room temperature. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories #PK-6101) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nonspecific binding was blocked by the incubation of tissues with 10% goat serum followed by avidin/biotin blocking (Vector Laboratories #SP-2001). Tissues were then incubated with the same primary antibodies that were used in confocal microscopy (see above) followed by biotinylated secondary antibodies and then an avidin-conjugated peroxidase enzyme. Immunohistochemical staining was visualized by adding a chromogenic peroxidase substrate, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Vector Laboratories #SK-4100), which produces a brown precipitate. As a negative control, instead of the primary antibody, a rabbit immunoglobulin G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc-2027) was used. Cell Fractionation—Fractionation of cells was carried out using a five-step sucrose gradient with a total volume of 36 ml consisting of the following sucrose concentrations layered from the bottom to top: 3.0 ml of 2.0 m sucrose, 6 ml of 1.6 m sucrose, 12 ml of 1.4 m sucrose plus homogenate, 12 ml of 1.2 m sucrose, and 3.0 ml of 0.8 m sucrose. Cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped from the plates and collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g, at 4 °C. They were then homogenized on ice with a Dounce homogenizer using HB buffer, ∼3 ml per 500 μl of cell pellet (HB buffer: 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 2 mm EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture tablet Roche #11836153001). Cell homogenate was spun at low speed to remove nuclei and unbroken cells, and supernatant was adjusted with 2.55 m sucrose to a final concentration of 1.4 m sucrose and loaded onto the gradient. Tubes were spun in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 25,000 rpm for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Three fractions enriched in plasma membrane, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum containing visible bands of protein were collected from the top to bottom. To remove sucrose each fraction was diluted to 25 ml with HB buffer and spun at 30,000 rpm for 30 min in Beckman 50.2Ti rotor. The pellets were re-suspended in an appropriate volume of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). 64Cu Uptake Assays—For copper uptake experiments, cells were plated on 4.67-cm2 permeable membrane supports in Transwells (Corning) and grown as described above for biotinylation. The cells were washed twice in PBS, and fresh DMEM medium with 10% FBS was added to the apical (1.35 ml) and to the basal (1.8 ml) compartments. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Copper uptake was initiated by adding 150 μl apically or 200 μl basolaterally of 10× copper solution containing trace levels of 64Cu (MIR radiological sciences, Washington University Medical School) and the desired concentration of CuCl2. Cells were incubated for the desired times at 37 °C, and copper transport was terminated by the addition of ice-cold stop buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 10 mm Na2-EDTA), after which cells were washed 3 additional times with ice-cold stop buffer. The media were then aspirated, and membrane supports were excised from the Transwells with a scalpel and placed in a container with added Eco-Lume scintillation liquid (ICN Biomedicals #882470) for scintillation counting (Beckman-Coulter LS6500). All transport determinations were carried out in triplicate. 64Cu content of the initial tracer-containing buffer was determined for the calculation of specific activity. Copper uptake was then expressed as pmol of copper taken up by the cells per mg of protein after determination of the protein content of the cell monolayer by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad #500-0006). Inhibitory effects of silver and cadmium ions on 64Cu uptake were determined by including a 50-fold molar excess of AgNO3 or CdCl2 in the transport medium in each compartment of the Transwell and then running the copper uptake assay as described above. Our transport experiments were carried out under conditions designed to optimize the determination of the true initial rate of copper uptake into the cells (that is, only a very small fraction, less than 2%, of the applied apical copper enters the cells). Under these conditions we found that less than 0.15% of the applied apical copper appeared in the basolateral solution, indicating that the cell monolayer was not leaky. Western Blots—Sample preparation for Western blot analysis included addition of 2× sample loading buffer (5% SDS, 1.6 m urea, and 240 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and 1.5% mercaptoethanol followed by heating for 10 min at 50 °C. About 30-50 μg of samples were loaded in each lane of 12% Laemmli gels. Gels were run at constant 24 mA for about 2 h and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore #IPVH00010) at 180 mA for 3 h. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk and then treated with antibodies diluted in 1% milk. For detection of hCTR1 protein, the following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-C terminus hCtr1 antibody at 1:10,000 dilution or rabbit anti-loop hCtr1 antibody at 1:500 dilution followed by anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences, NA934V). Blots were developed using SuperSignal West Pico peroxide and enhancer solutions (Pierce, #1856135 and 1856136). The intensity of the Western signals was measured using chemiluminescent imaging with the ChemiDoc XRS (Bio-Rad) and quantitated using QUANTITY ONE Version 4.6.2 software (Bio-Rad). Copper Uptake Measurements in Intestinal Cells—Caco2 cell line, derived from human colon adenocarcinoma, can be cultured to a high confluence as a continuous monolayer, forming tight junctions and spontaneously differentiating into polarized epithelial cells with characteristics of mature enterocytes, including formation of an apical brush border. Caco2 monolayers serve as a well established model for the evaluation of absorption of drugs and nutrients by the intestinal epithelium and have been used previously to assess the mechanisms of metal ion absorption (19Tandy S. Williams M. Leggett A. Lopez-Jimenez M. Dedes M. Ramesh B. Srai S.K. Sharp P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275,: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). T84 cells, derived from a human colorectal carcinoma, are also capable of developing tight junctions and desmosomes, and they differentiate into polarized columnar cells resembling intestinal crypt epithelia (24Uribe J.M. McCole D.F. Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2002; 283,: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We initially characterized the relative ability of intestinal cells to carry out copper uptake across either their apical or basolateral plasma membranes by measuring radioisotopic copper uptake from each of these sides independently. The results of these experiments revealed a striking asymmetry in the rates of copper uptake (Fig. 1). Using 1 μm copper there was a 12-fold higher rate of copper uptake from the basolateral than the apical surface in Caco2 cells and about 20-fold higher basolateral uptake in T-84 cells. At 3 μm copper this difference decreased somewhat to about 7- and 10-fold in the Caco-2 and T-84 cells, respectively, but remained high, indicative of the basolateral membrane being a predominant route of copper entry. The observation that with the increasing copper concentrations the ratio between basolateral and apical transported changing suggested that the copper dependence of uptake differed at two membranes. Consequently, we determined the concentration dependence for copper transport at each membrane by measuring the initial rates of uptake using a wide range of copper concentrations. The data for Caco2 cells are shown in Fig. 2. Uptake across the apical membrane increases monotonically with copper concentration and shows no sign of saturation in the range studied (up to 35 μm). In contrast, copper uptake across the basolateral surface is composed of two components. In the range of physiological copper concentrations (1-10 μm) the basolateral uptake is largely composed of a saturating component (see the inset in Fig. 2) and a small contribution from a non-saturating component. Correction for the linear component of this data yielded a maximal transport rate for the saturable component of 891 pmol of copper/mg × h, with a Km of 5.4 μm. There are two unexpected aspects to these observations. First, it was anticipated that in intestinal cells copper uptake would be high from the apical surface, because such uptake would have to satisfy both intracellular needs as well as provide copper for further distribution to the body. Clearly this is not the case. Uptake at the basolateral surface is not only higher, but it is also mediated via a high affinity system, whereas the lower apical transport is of low affinity. The Km value for basolateral transport we obtained is close to the values of 1-5 μm previously reported for hCTR1 (8Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Heparosan (N-acetylheparosan) (-GlcUA-β1,4-GlcNAc-α1,4-) is the repeating sugar backbone of the polysaccharide found in the capsule of certain pathogenic bacteria as well as the biosynthetic precursor of heparin or heparan sulfate found in animals from hydra to vertebrates (1DeAngelis P.L.

In mammals, the sulfated forms bind to a variety of extremely important polypeptides including hemostasis factors (e.g. antithrombin III, thrombin), growth factors (e.g. EGF, VEGF), and chemokines (e.g. interleukin-8, platelet factor 4) as well as the adhesive proteins for viral pathogens (e.g. herpes, Dengue fever) (4Capila I.

In the future, similar polymers and derivatives should also be useful for pharmacological intervention in a variety of pathologic conditions including neoplasia and viral infection. Several enzyme systems have been identified that synthesize heparosan. In bacteria, either a pair of two separate glycosyltransferases (Escherichia coli KfiA and KfiC) (6Hodson N. Griffiths G.

The heparosan synthases from P. multocida possess both a hexosamine and a glucuronic acid transfer site in the same polypeptide chain, as shown by mutagenesis studies (10Kane T.A. White C.L. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and are therefore referred to as “dual action” or bifunctional glycosyltransferases. These enzymes are complex because they employ both an inverting and a retaining mechanism when transferring the monosaccharide from UDP precursors to the nonreducing terminus of a growing chain. The two Pasteurella heparosan synthases, PmHS1 and PmHS2, are ∼70% identical at the amino acid sequence level. The two genes are found in different regions of the bacterial chromosome: PmHS1 (hssA) is associated with the prototypical Gram-negative type II carbohydrate biosynthesis gene locus, but PmHS2 (hssB) resides far removed in an unspecialized region (8DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8529-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that the catalytic utility of PmHS1 and PmHS2 are very distinct as measured by various criteria including their ability to produce polymers either with monodisperse size distributions or with unnatural sugar compositions. Materials—Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher unless otherwise noted. Custom synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Various HA molecular weight standards were obtained from Hyalose LLC (Oklahoma City, OK). Construction and Purification of Recombinant Maltose-binding Fusion Construct Proteins—PmHS1 and PmHS2 were both expressed as a carboxyl-terminal fusion to maltose-binding protein (MBP) using the pMAL-c2X vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Polymerase chain reaction was employed to subclone the open reading frames from our previous pET-Blue-1 constructs (7DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7209-7213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8529-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For PmHS1, new unique flanking restriction sites (BamHI and HindIII) were added with the primers used for amplification (15 cycles: 94 °C, 30 s; 52 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 2 min) with Taq DNA polymerase. For PmHS2, restriction sites (BamHI and PstI) were added with the primers used for amplification (21 cycles: 94 °C, 30 s; 52 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 3.5 min) with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The amplicons were gel-purified, restriction-digested with both appropriate enzymes (Promega, Madison, WI), and ligated to similarly double cut pMAL-c2X plasmid. E. coli One Shot® Top 10F′ (Invitrogen) was used for the initial transformation on LB ampicillin (100 μg/ml) plates and grown at 30 °C. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (OMRF Sequencing Facility, Oklahoma City, OK). To facilitate extracting the enzymes, the expression host E. coli XJa (Zymo Research, Orange, CA), which encodes a phage lysin enzyme, was employed allowing for simple freeze/thaw lysis. Cultures were grown in Superior Broth (AthenaES, Baltimore, MD) at 30 °C with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and l-arabinose (3.25 mm; to induce the lysin enzyme). At mid-log phase, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.2 mm final) was added to induce fusion protein production. One hour after induction, the cultures were supplemented with fructose (12.8 mm final) and grown for ∼5–12 h before harvesting by centrifugation at 4 °C. The bacteria were resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and protease inhibitors (p-[4–2-aminoethyl]benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, pepstatin, benzamidine, N-[N-(l-3-trans-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-leucyl]-agmatine, leupeptin) on ice, and frozen and thawed twice allowing lysin to degrade the cell walls. The lysates was clarified by centrifugation. The synthases were affinity purified via the MBP unit using amylose resin (New England Biolabs). After extensive washing with column buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), the protein was eluted in column buffer containing 10 mm maltose. Protein concentration was quantitated by the Bradford assay (Pierce) using a bovine serum albumin standard. The purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE with copper negative staining or Coomassie Blue staining (protein molecular weight standards, Bio-Rad). Western blot analyses employed either (a) a rabbit anti-peptide antibody directed to the KGDIIFFQDSDDVCHHERIER sequence of PmHS1 and PmHS2 (8DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8529-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or (b) a rabbit anti-MBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by detection with protein A-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Calbiochem) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt/nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride. Yields were about 1–2 mg of protein/liter of culture. Aliquots were stored at -80 °C; the activity of the synthases was stable to several freeze/thaw cycles. Western blotting was used to normalize the amounts of intact PmHS1 and PmHS2 polypeptide used in kinetic assays. Acceptor Preparations—The ∼55-kDa heparosan polysaccharide acceptor (8DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8529-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control and a normalization factor for many experiments. Heparosan oligosaccharides ((GlcUA-GlcNAc)n-(GlcUA-anhydromannitol), n = 1, 2, or 3) were prepared by partial deacetylation with base, nitrous acid hydrolysis, and reduction (11Chen M. Bridges A. Liu J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12358-12365Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); these polymers contain intact nonreducing termini but an anhydromannitol group at the reducing end. The fragments were purified by gel filtration on a P2 column (Bio-Rad) in 0.2 m ammonium formate followed by normal phase thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica plates (Whatman) with butyl alcohol/acetic acid/water (1:1:1). The bands were detected by staining the side lanes with napthoresorcinol (12DeAngelis P.L. Oatman L.C. Gay D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35199-35203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The size and purity of oligosaccharides were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (12DeAngelis P.L. Oatman L.C. Gay D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35199-35203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fluorescein di-β-d-glucuronide (A-F-A; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a commercially available synthetic acceptor that mimics a glycosaminoglycan trisaccharide that was identified in previous work with the Pasteurella HA synthase (13Williams K.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 5391-5397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), was used as the starting material to prepare the A-F-AN (GlcUA-F-GlcUA-GlcNAc) and NA-F-AN (GlcNAc-GlcUA-F-GlcUA-GlcNAc) acceptors using UDP-GlcNAc with PmHS2 under conditions described later under “Single Sugar Addition Assays.” These longer acceptors were purified by TLC (silica plates and butyl alcohol/acetic acid/water, 2:1:1). In addition to lower costs than authentic oligosaccharides, the A-F-A-based acceptors also yielded better signals in mass spectrometric analyses. Polymerization Assays—Radiolabeled sugar incorporation assays using UDP-[3H]GlcUA or UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (13Williams K.J. Halkes K.M. Kamerling J.P. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5391-5397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were employed to monitor substrate usage and pH dependence. Polymerization reactions (40 μl) typically contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.5–1.0 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 0.5–1 mm UDP-GlcUA, 0.1 μCi of UDP-[3H]sugar, and ∼4–5 μg of enzyme (unless noted). The reactions were typically incubated at 30 °C for 15–30 min and then stopped with SDS (2% final). Descending paper chromatography was used to separate unincorporated UDP-sugars from the polymer product (i.e. longer than ∼14 sugars) (13Williams K.J. Halkes K.M. Kamerling J.P. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5391-5397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Three separate experiments were completed for each data set, and each assay was verified to be in the linear range with respect to time and enzyme concentration. Less than 5% of the UDP-sugar was consumed. For acceptor usage tests, a “no acceptor” control was performed for all assays to determine the de novo initiation heparosan synthesis for each enzyme; this value was subtracted from the value attained in parallel assays with an acceptor. For initial tests querying the ability of a synthase to misincorporate a non-authentic UDP-sugar donor, the test compound was used at ∼0.5–1.5 mm in the presence of carrier-free UDP-[3H]GlcUA or UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (0.1 μCi) without acceptor for 12–48 h. Subsequent assays to obtain relative kinetic rates employed radiolabeled authentic UDP-sugar diluted to 0.6 mm for 90 or 180 min. Monodisperse Heparosan Synthesis—A mixture of heparosan tetrasaccharide and hexasaccharide (∼1:4 by mass, respectively) acceptors was used to prime synthesis of narrow size distribution heparosan polymers. The length of the chain was controlled by altering the stoichiometry of the UDP-sugar to acceptor as for the nonhomologous PmHAS, the Pasteurella HA synthase (14Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42345-42349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These reactions typically contained 5 mm UDP-sugars in the same reaction buffer used for polymerization assays and were incubated overnight at 30 °C. Single Sugar Addition Assays—Tests were performed under the same buffer conditions as for polymerization assays but contained only a single UDP-sugar substrate (∼1–3 mm final) and an appropriately terminated acceptor (e.g. heparosan oligosaccharide, A-F-A or A-F-AN). The incorporation of sugar from the donor substrate was also detected by the increase in mass to the appropriate predicted molecular weight product by MALDI-TOF MS. Sugar Analysis Techniques—The sizes of the heparosan polymers were analyzed with agarose gels (1.2–3%, 1× Tris acetate-EDTA buffer, 30 V for 5–6 h) and Stains-All (1-ethyl-2-[3-(1-ethylnaphtho[1,2-d]thiazolin-2-ylidene)-2-methylpropenyl]naphtho-[1,2-d]thiazolium bromide) detection (15Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) or with polyacrylamide gels (15%, 29:1 monomer:bis, 1× Tris borate-EDTA, 250 V for 30 min) and Alcian blue staining (16Ikegami-Kawai M. Takahashi T. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 311: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The size distribution of the polymers was determined by high performance size exclusion chromatography-multi-angle laser light scattering (14Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42345-42349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For yield estimates, the polymers were purified by heat treatment (95 °C, 1 min) and centrifugation (14,000 × g) to remove protein followed by desalting on PD10 columns (Sephadex G25; GE Healthcare) eluted with 0.2 m ammonium formate, a volatile buffer. The appropriate void volume fractions were pooled and lyophilized three times. The concentration of authentic heparosan polymers was assayed using the carbazole assay for uronic acid with GlcUA as the standard (17Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5192) Google Scholar). The unnatural GlcUA analogs used here did not have significant color yield in this assay (due to substitution of the pyranose ring), and therefore relative comparisons were made by densitometric analysis (ImageJ, version 1.37; rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) of Alcian blue-stained gels with a titration of matched sets of natural and unnatural polymers. Sugar molecular masses were measured by MALDI-TOF MS (Voyager Elite DE, Applied Biosystems Inc.; reflector mode, negative ions) using 6-aza-2-thiothymine or 2,4,6-trihydroxy-acetophenone matrix (5–10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) (12DeAngelis P.L. Oatman L.C. Gay D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35199-35203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To assess the linkages of the polymers, samples were treated with heparin lyase III (recombinant E. coli-derived Flavobacterium heparinum, EC 4.2.2.8) (18Duncan M.B. Liu M. Fox C. Liu J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 1232-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, at 37 °C for ∼6 h. UDP-glucosamine Synthesis—UDP-glucosamine (UDP-GlcN) was chemoenzymatically synthesized from GlcN-1-PO4 and UTP using immobilized recombinant GalU (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) and PPA (inorganic pyrophosphatase) enzymes from E. coli. GalU and PPA were both expressed as amino-terminal His6-tagged proteins with pET15b (Novagen) constructs (19Liu Z. Zhang J. Chen X. Wang P.G. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Enzymes were freeze/thaw extracted from the cell paste of E. coli XJa (DE3) (Zymo Research) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm imidazole in the presence of protease inhibitors and DNase/RNase (10 μg/ml). Each enzyme was immobilized in a purified state via the His6 tags using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid SuperFlow resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After washing with extraction buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, the resins were equilibrated with a reaction buffer composed of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 2 mm K2HPO4, and 10 mm MgCl2. A mixture of resins containing bound GalU and PPA enzymes was incubated overnight at room temperature with 15–39 mm GlcN-1-PO4 and 15–39 mm UTP in reaction buffer. UDP-GlcN was purified by preparative TLC (silica with butyl alcohol/acetic acid/water, 1.75:1:1) with UV shadowing (254 nm) detection followed by gel filtration on a P2 column in 0.2 m ammonium formate. The pure compound was lyophilized three times from water, and the negative ion molecular mass was verified by MALDI-TOF MS (predicted 564.03 Da, observed 564.13 Da). UDP-N-propionylglucosamine and UDP-N-butyrylglucosamine Synthesis—UDP-GlcN (15–25 mg/ml) was mixed with saturated NaHCO3 (pH∼10, 2–3 volumes), and any sodium silicate precipitate was removed by centrifugation. For UDP-N-propionylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNPro) and UDP-N-butyrylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNBut) preparation, a 5% solution of propionic anhydride or butyric anhydride in water (65 molar excess) was added and reacted at room temperature for 5 or 15 min, respectively. Reactions were desalted using a P2 column and lyophilization as for UDP-GlcN. The product negative ion molecular masses were verified by MALDI-TOF MS (UDP-GlcNPro predicted 620.06 Da, observed 620.38 Da; UDP-GlcNBut predicted 634.08 Da, observed 634.12 Da). UDP-α-d-N-acetylglucosaminuronic Acid, UDP-2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-α-d-glucose, and UDP-2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-α-d-glucuronic Acid Synthesis—As we reported recently (20Rejzek M. Mukhopadhyay B. Wenzel C.Q. Lam J.S. Field R.A. Carbohydr. Res. 2007; 342: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), UDP-α-d-N-acetyl-glucosaminuronic acid (UDP-GlcNAcUA), an analog possessing identical functional groups at the same positions as the authentic pair of donors, was prepared by direct oxidation of commercial UDP-α-d-N-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) using platinum-catalyzed oxidation with molecular oxygen. Following purification by strong anion exchange chromatography, the resulting triammonium salt of UDP-GlcNAcUA was converted to the more water-soluble trisodium salt by treatment with a cation exchange resin (Dowex 50WX8–200, Na+ form). UDP-2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-α-d-glucose (UDP-GlcdiNAc), an analog with an additional amide group at the C-3 position as compared with authentic UDP-GlcNAc, was synthesized from commercially available N-acetyl-d-glucosamine by a multistep synthesis (full details will be published elsewhere). UDP-2,3-diacetamido-2,3-dideoxy-α-d-glucuronic acid (UDP-Glcdi-NAcUA) was prepared by direct oxidation of UDP-GlcdiNAc using the platinum-catalyzed oxidation procedure described above (20Rejzek M. Mukhopadhyay B. Wenzel C.Q. Lam J.S. Field R.A. Carbohydr. Res. 2007; 342: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The triammonium salt was again converted into the trisodium salt for use in enzymatic reactions. Improved Catalysts with Distinct Kinetic Properties—The maltose-binding protein/heparosan synthase fusion constructs had greatly increased protein expression in comparison with the earlier generation thioredoxin PmHS1 fusion construct (10Kane T.A. White C.L. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The MBP also allowed for efficient purification as depicted in Fig. 1; in contrast, the thioredoxin affinity handle was observed to leach substantial amounts of target protein, thus thwarting purification attempts (data not shown). Furthermore, both MBP-PmHS constructs possessed increased stability at useful reaction temperatures (e.g. active at pH 7.2 at 30 °C for 24 h). Previous studies on the efficiency of cognate acceptor utilization by the crude native sequence enzymes suggested that these relatively homologous Pasteurella synthases had different catalytic properties; the acceptor stimulated PmHS1 sugar incorporation ∼7–25-fold (by serving as a primer to circumvent the slow initiation step), whereas PmHS2 is boosted only by ∼2.5-fold (7DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7209-7213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8529-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These levels of acceptor stimulation were also observed for the purified fusion enzymes. In polymerization assays without acceptor, it also appears that purified PmHS2 has an ∼2-fold higher level of de novo initiation of sugar chains compared with purified PmHS1 (∼5.2 versus ∼2.6 pmol of monosaccharide transferred/min/μg protein). On the other hand, it appears that PmHS1 has an elongation rate that is ∼3-fold faster than PmHS2 (∼76 versus ∼28 pmol of monosaccharide transferred/min/μg protein). The pH profiles as determined by polymerization assays were also different; the purified PmHS1 catalyst preferred a neutral pH, whereas purified PmHS2 preferred acidic (pH ∼4–5) conditions (Fig. 2). This result of differential activity was not expected considering that the protein sequences of PmHS1 and PmHS2 are relatively homologous. Simplistically, based on expected amino acid side-chain pKa values, it may be likely that one or more histidine residues in PmHS2 (but not present in PmHS1) are protonated at the lower pH, thus gaining a positive charge, making a better contact, or providing improved electrostatic steering for a negatively charged substrate (either a heparosan oligosaccharide or a UDP-sugar). Alternatively, one or more glutamate or aspartate residues in PmHS2 (but not PmHS1) are protonated at lower pH and thus neutralized, reducing potential electrostatic repulsion of a negatively charged substrate. It is important to note that even though PmHS2 prefers the acidic pH for maximal activity, this catalyst is not very stable in those conditions. The PmHS2 protein did not demonstrate noticeable additional proteolysis at low pH as assessed by Western blotting (not shown); thus the loss of activity must be due to denaturing via an unfolding event. We examined the size of acceptor oligosaccharide preferred by each of the synthases. The heparosan tetrasaccharide was about ∼150- and ∼8-fold better than the corresponding disaccharide for PmHS1 or PmHS2, respectively. In addition, the synthetic glycoside, A-F-A, was also a useful acceptor for PmHS1 and PmHS2. These findings suggest that the size of the active site pockets of the heparosan synthases may be similar to those hypothesized for the acceptor sites of PmHAS, the HA synthase (13Williams K.J. Halkes K.M. Kamerling J.P. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5391-5397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); a site that appears to bind 3 or 4 monosaccharides is hypothesized to make contact with the nascent HA chain. Monodisperse Heparosan—Synchronized polymerization reactions should result in monodisperse polymers as observed previously for PmHAS (14Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42345-42349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The formation of heparosan with a narrow size distribution is dependent on the ability of the glycosyltransferase to be primed by acceptors (thus avoiding a slow de novo initiation event yielding out-of-step elongation events) and to efficiently transfer monosaccharides from UDP-sugars. It is likely that PmHS1 catalyzes the synthesis of higher molecular weight monodisperse polymer when compared with PmHS2 because of its better ability to utilize and rapidly elongate exogenously supplied acceptors. As determined by agarose gel and SEC-MALLS analyses (Fig. 3), PmHS1 produced various sizes of monodisperse high molecular weight heparosan (∼70% average yield based on starting UDP-sugars), whereas under identical conditions PmHS2 did not. Such monodisperse heparosan polymer may serve as the starting material for the creation of defined molecules that are more predictable with respect to biological responses and potency. Polymers with Unnatural Structures—The testing of a variety of different UDP-sugar donor substrates is a means of determining the tolerance of the synthase active sites for a variety of donor and acceptor functional groups. Characterizing donor preference is obvious, but in the case of a polymer with repeating saccharide units, once a sugar is added onto the nonreducing terminus of the nascent chain, the unnatural sugar then serves as an acceptor substrate. Therefore, a successful analog must be able to play multiple roles to produce a polysaccharide chain. MALDI-TOF MS analyses and radiolabeled sugar incorporation assays revealed that PmHS2 has the ability to catalyze the incorporation of several unnatural donor sugar analogs, whereas PmHS1 appears much more strict (Table 1, Fig. 4). The GlcNAc-transferase site of PmHS2 will accept different acyl chain lengths at the C-2 position as long as the amine is acylated but does not appear to tolerate substitution at the C-3 or C-5 positions. Interestingly, UDP-GlcNPro, the UDP-GlcNAc analog with an extra methylene group in the acyl chain, is preferred by both enzymes more than the authentic substrate; perhaps a hydrophobic pocket is responsible for this catalyst/substrate contact. However, this pocket must have limited dimensions because UDP-GlcNBut, a molecule with two more additional methylene units than the authentic donor, is a worse substrate. By analogy, a hydrophobic pocket on glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins or receptors such as the HA-binding site of TSG-6 (21Blundell C.D. Almond A. Mahoney D.J. DeAngelis P.L. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18189-18201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) may bind with higher affinity to polymers containing hexosamines with longer acyl chains, and thus new sugar ligand derivatives with more potent inhibition or signaling effects may be possible.TABLE 1Donor substrate usage by PmHS1 and PmHS2 Each UDP-sugar analog was tested for its ability to substitute for UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GlcUA by radiolabeled sugar polymerization assays and paper chromatography. An authentic UDP-sugar and the appropriate second UDP-sugar analog (e.g. UDP-GlcUA and a potential UDP-GlcNAc substitute) were co-incubated with enzyme. The rates for the combination of both authentic donors, UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA, are set to 100%. Analogs are presented as: +++, >200%; ++, 100-11%; +, 10-1%; -, <∼0.2%; NA, not applicable. All positive compounds were verified by single sugar addition assays with mass spectrometry (Fig. 4) except for UDP-GlcdiNAcUA because of low transfer efficiency. Overall, PmHS2 can misincorporate several analogs, but PmHS1 appears to have more restricted donor usage.UDP-sugar analogPmHS1 substitutes for:PmHS2 substitutes for:UDP-GlcUA?UDP-GlcNAc?UDP-GlcUA?UDP-GlcNAc?UDP-GlcNNA–NA–UDP-GlcNAcUA––+–UDP-GlcdiNAcNA–NA–UDP-GlcdiNAcUA––+–UDP-GlcNButNA–NA+UDP-GlcNProNA+++NA+++ Open table in a new tab The GlcUA-transferase site of PmHS2, but not PmHS1, is tolerant of extra chemical groups at the C-2 or C-3 position (Table 1). The UDP-GlcNAcUA analog possesses within a single pyranose unit both the C-6 carboxylate and the C-2 acetylated amide groups (normally found separately on two adjacent pyranose units in native heparosan). It was observed that the PmHS2 enzyme utilizes this analog to only substitute for the uronic acid unit of the disaccharide repeat and not the hexosamine (Table 1). At this time, it is difficult to predict whether this analog fails as a hexosamine because it is a poor donor and/or a poor acceptor. Preparative syntheses employing PmHS2 catalyst with no acceptor gave average polymer yields of ∼60% or ∼22% for authentic heparosan versus unnatural GlcNAcUA-containing heparosan, respectively. Higher concentrations of UDP-sugar precursor helped compensate for the slower incorporation rates of some unnatural analogs. The relaxed specificity of PmHS2 could be because of different active site geometry or different surrounding residues other than PmHS1, which facilitates the favorable binding interactions and/or avoids certain hindrances (e.g. steric, electrostatic) with the analogs. Overall, these results help to elucidate the nature of the synthase active site without an experimentally determined three-dimensional enzyme structure. From previous work (7DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7209-7213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8529-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and here with purified PmHS1 and PmHS2, the isomeric state of the C-4 hydroxyl of the UDP-sugar precursors appears to be critical for these synthases because the C-4 epimers of the authentic substrates, UDP-Gal-NAc and UDP-GalUA, are not functional analogs in the polymerization assay (not shown). This observed stringency is probably because of the importance of the hydroxyls forming the glycosidic linkages of the heparosan chain (-GlcUA-β1,4-Glc-NAc-α1,4-) residing in the correct orientation for catalytic residues to couple the saccharide units. The evolutionary history of PmHS1 and PmHS2 is not yet known. Two opposing hypotheses are possible: i) the “traditional” scenario, where a gene encoding a substrate selective PmHS1 progenitor is duplicated, and the resulting PmHS2 ancestor, unfettered from its normal duty of making heparosan, becomes less specific for a potential hitherto unknown function; or ii) a more recently recognized scenario (22Jensen R.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1976; 30: 409-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), where a gene encoding a nonspecific PmHS2 progenitor is duplicated resulting in a PmHS1 ancestor that becomes more substrate-specific in order to make heparosan. As PmHS2 (but not PmHS1) occurs in many type A and type F strains (HA or chondroitin capsule producers, respectively) (8DeAngelis P.L. White C.L. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8529-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), model ii may be more likely. More DNA sequence information from other isolates and species may be required to establish whether PmHS1 or PmHS2 was the primordial enzyme. Pathogenic bacteria are under extreme selective pressure from host defenses, and thus the potential to alter capsule composition and maintain virulence is a valuable asset. The promiscuity of PmHS2 makes it a useful catalyst for preparing glycosaminoglycan polymer analogs with new biological or chemical properties. For example, unnatural polymers containing the GlcNAcUA monomer are not digested by heparin lyase III, an enzyme known to digest most other heparinoids (Fig. 5). Depending on the substitutions, similar heparinoids may have a slower turnover rate potentially making it a longer acting therapeutic. These new polymers should also prove to be very useful in the pursuit of understanding the structure/function relationships of the polymer and the interaction of heparinoids with various binding proteins including receptors, growth factors, and coagulation factors.

All of these PanK isoforms share a common, highly homologous catalytic core that is composed of about 355 residues (e.g. the identity of ∼83%).

The NH2-terminal domain of PanK2 includes two mitochondrial targeting signals, which are removed proteolytically concomitant with its mitochondrial localization (3Hortnagel K. Prokisch H.

Patients with PKAN exhibit motor symptoms, such as dystonia, dysarthria, intellectual impairment, and gait disturbance (9Gregory A. Hayflick S.J.

A current hypothesis of PKAN pathogenesis states that PANK2 mutations lead to a loss of PanK2 function and reduced phosphopantothenate, resulting in the accumulation of cysteine-containing molecules and CoA deficiency (6Johnson M.A. Kuo Y.M.

A common feature of the PanK isoforms is that they are feedback inhibited by CoA and its thioesters. This regulation is a primary mechanism that controls PanK activity and hence the intracellular CoA level (2Rock C.O. Karim M.A. Zhang Y.M. Jackowski S.

Due to the low sequence homology, the structural interpretation of the disease-causing human PanK2 mutations using the SaPanK model is limited to three missense mutations that directly affect the active site (17Hong B.-S.

We have determined the homodimeric structures of the catalytic cores of human PanK1α and PanK3 in complex with acetyl-CoA. These crystallographic data provide the first look at the structures of metazoan PanKs and their allosteric regulation. The high degree of similarity between human PanK3 and PanK2 allows an analysis of the mutations associated with PKAN. PanK2 missense mutations mapped onto the active site, dimerization interface, and protein interior tend to be associated with the early onset of PKAN phenotypes and their corresponding PanK3 mutant proteins show PanK inactivation and destabilization. On the other hand, mutations of surface residues have less severe effects on enzyme function and correlate with the mixed early and late onsets of disease. Protein Expression and Purification—The genes encoding the catalytic core domains of human PanK1α (residues 231–597, abbreviated PanK1 below) and PanK3 (residues 12–368) were amplified using PCR and cloned into the expression vector pET28a to obtain NH2-terminal His6 tag fusion proteins. E. coli BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) was transformed with the resulting plasmids and both recombinant PanK1 and PanK3 proteins were overexpressed upon 1.0 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction for 18 h at 18 °C. The proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity and Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) gel-filtration columns. Purified PanK1 and PanK3 samples were concentrated to 25 and 30 mg/ml, respectively, and stored at -80 °C in the gel filtration buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol). Crystallization—PanK proteins were crystallized using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. To achieve full occupancy of bound ligands, the proteins were mixed with 5-fold molar excess of an ATP analogue AMP-PNP or acetyl-CoA. The mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir solution were combined for crystallization. Crystals of PanK1 were grown at 0.1 m Na-Hepes (pH 7.5), 28% PEG400, 0.2 m CaCl2, and 0.02 m tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride-HCl, and PanK3 was crystallized in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 16% PEG3350, 0.2 m ammonium citrate, and 0.02 m octaethyleneglycol dodecyl ether (C12E8). The mercury derivatives were obtained by soaking PanK1 crystals in the reservoir solution with 5 mm ethylmercury thiosalicylate overnight. All crystals were cryoprotected in the 50:50 mixture of Paratone-N and mineral oil, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The diffraction quality crystals of PanK1 were obtained in the presence of acetyl-CoA. Although AMP-PNP was added for the crystallization of PanK3, we found acetyl-CoA molecules in the structure that co-purified with PanK3. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Diffraction data were collected on beamline 19-BM at the Advanced Photon Source, running at 100 K and processed using the HKL2000 program package (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The program SOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was used to locate four mercury sites and to calculate initial phases of PanK1 and the program RESOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar) to improve the initial phases. The model of PanK1 was completed in several repetitions of manual building with the program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The structure of PanK3 was solved by the molecular replacement method using the program MOLREP in the CCP4 package (23Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the PanK1 structure as a search model, and built using the program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Finally, both PanK structures were refined with the program REFMAC5 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). The crystals of PanK1 contained a dimer in the asymmetric unit and the two monomers were related by noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry. In PanK3, two dimers were in the asymmetric unit. A dimer state is the most common functional organization for PanK proteins (4Kotzbauer P.T. Truax A.C. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J.

Med. 2003; 348: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), site-directed mutagenesis in PanK3 was accomplished using the Stratagene QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Prior to protein expression, the sequences of all mutations were verified by sequencing, and each mutant protein was purified as described for the wild-type protein, except the concentration of dithiothreitol was 1.0 mm. PanK Activity Assay—The effect of acetyl-CoA on the PanK1α and PanK3 Km values for ATP was investigated by using the assay previously described (2Rock C.O. Karim M.A. Zhang Y.M. Jackowski S. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 291: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Rock C.O. Park H.W. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3410-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 180 μm d-[1-14C]pantothenate (Amersham Biosciences), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 ng of PanK1α or 100 ng of PanK3 and increasing concentrations of ATP and acetyl-CoA, as indicated. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and the radioactive product was quantitated by scintillation counting as described previously (11Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 107-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Activities of PanK3 mutant proteins were compared with the wild-type using the standard pantothenate kinase assay (11Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 107-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 90 μm d-[1-14C]pantothenate, 2.5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 100 ng of purified protein, and assayed as described above. Relative activities of the mutant proteins were checked three times and these data were combined. UV-visible Spectra and Mass Spectrometry—UV-visible spectra of PanK3 wild-type and mutant proteins (1 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% (v/v) glycerol) were recorded as described previously (27Leonardi R. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Zhang Y.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1494-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The supernatant (100 μl) from a heat-denatured sample of PanK3 (1.8 mg/ml in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0) was desalted on a C-8 MicroTip column (Harvard Apparatus), washed with water, and the protein-bound small molecules were eluted with methanol (100 μl), dried under N2 flow, and resuspended in methanol:water (1:1, v/v, 10 μl). Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using a Finnigan™ TSQ® Quantum™ (Thermo Electron Corporation, San Jose, CA) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with the nanospray ion source. Stability Studies by Differential Static Light Scattering—The thermostabilities of PanK3 and its mutant proteins were studied using differential static light scattering (28Senisterra G.A. Markin E.

A. 2006; 103: 15835-15840Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), monitoring protein stability by its aggregation properties. Protein samples at 0.2 mg/ml were heated from 25 to 80 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min in clear bottom 384-well plates (Nunc) in 50 μl of buffer (100 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Protein aggregation was measured by recording the scattered light using a CCD camera and taking images of the plate every 0.5 °C. The pixels intensities in a preselected region of each well were integrated using proprietary software to generate a value representative of the total amount of scattered light in that region. These intensities were plotted against temperature for each sample well and fitted to Equation 1 as described by Matulis et al. (30Matulis D. Kranz J.K. Salemme F.R. Todd M.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5258-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), I=If+Io-If1+e(-ΔH/R)(1/T-1/Tagg)+ΔCpInTTagg+TaggT-1(Eq. 1) where Io and If are the intensities of light scattered by the protein before and after denaturation, ΔH is the enthalpy of unfolding, R is the general gas constant, Tagg is the temperature of aggregation that represents the melting temperature, and ΔCp is the heat capacity difference between the unfolded and folded states of the protein. ΔCp of 4.93 kcal/mol was calculated based on the protein sequence and was used in all subsequence calculations (31Robertson A.D. Murphy K.P. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1251-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The free energy difference ΔΔG between the wild-type and each mutant protein at the temperature of aggregation of the wild-type was calculated using Equation 2, ΔΔGm(Twt)=ΔHm-[Twt/Tm]·ΔHm(Eq. 2) where ΔΔGm(Twt) is the denaturation free energy difference between the wild-type and mutant PanK3, Twt and Tm are the aggregation temperatures of the wild-type and mutant proteins, respectively. Stability Studies by Isothermal Aggregation (ITA)—Isothermal aggregation was measured at 37 °C. Protein samples at 0.2 mg/ml were incubated at 37 °C in clear bottom 384-well plates (Nunc) in 50 μl of buffer (100 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Protein aggregation was monitored by detecting the scattered light by taking images every 30 s using a CCD camera for 2 h. Images were analyzed and the intensities were plotted versus time. All curves were normalized to compensate for small differences in initial intensities. The time it takes to have 50% of the protein in the aggregation state, here on, is termed ITA50. Each experiment was repeated 5 times and the average has been reported here. The PanK1 and PanK3 proteins we crystallized represent the catalytic core domain, which is highly conserved in all human PanK isoforms. The identity between the catalytic core domains of the two isoforms is ∼84% (ClustalW 1.7). The overall monomer fold places the human PanKs in the actin fold protein kinase superfamily (32Kabsch W. Holmes K.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and contains two domains (Fig. 1A). The A domain consists of a six-stranded β-sheet (strands Ab1–Ab6) flanked by five helices (Ah1–Ah3 on one side and Ah4 and Ah11 on the other side) and a glycine-rich loop, characteristic of many nucleotide-binding sites (33Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar, 34Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar), lies between strands Ab1 and Ab2. The B domain consists of a nine-stranded β-sheet (strands Bb7–Bb15). One side of this sheet is flanked by six helices (Bh5–Bh10) and an extended loop region between helices Bh6 and Bh9, whereas the other side faces the A domain. The B domains of PanK1 and PanK3 contain an extensive dimerization interface. Whereas the overall root mean square deviation of the two PanK structures including both A and B domains was ∼1.5 Å for the Cα atoms, the root mean square deviation of the A domain was 1.4 Å, and the root mean square deviation of the B domain was 0.85 Å, suggesting that the B domains are structurally more conserved than the A domains (supplemental Fig. S1). As the A domain in the PanK1 model was partly incomplete due to poor electron density (supplemental Fig. S1), the PanK3 structure was used for “Results” and “Discussion,” and only its differences from PanK1 were pointed out. The major portion of the dimerization interface is composed of two long helices, Bh9 and Bh9′ from each monomer, which interact with each other in parallel resulting in a V-shaped conformation (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S2A). Helices Bh9 and Bh9′ widen at their NH2-terminal ends and form a four-helix bundle with two short helices Bh5 and Bh5′ (supplemental Fig. S2A). The center of the four-helix bundle is lined by non-polar residues forming a compact hydrophobic core. The narrow COOH-terminal ends of helices Bh9 and Bh9′ are held together by van der Waals interactions between Val304 and Met307 of each monomer, and are capped by Asn311 and Asn311′ which face each other. The middle of helices Bh9 and Bh9′ is attached by both direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds between Asn300 and Asn300′. Additional van der Waals interactions exist between Bh5 of one monomer and the extended loop of the second monomer contributing to the stabilization of the PanK dimer (supplemental Fig. S2B). In both PanK1 and PanK3 structures, the acetyl pantetheine diphosphate moiety of acetyl-CoA is bound parallel to the β strands of the B domain of one monomer and covered on the other side by the extended loop of the second monomer (Fig. 2A). The main interactions of acetyl-CoA with PanKs occur via the acetyldiphosphopantetheine moiety (Fig. 2B). The 3′-phosphoadenonsine moiety is poorly defined in the electron density map, suggesting that it is disordered and thus not included in the final PanK structures. Residues lining the binding site of the acetyldiphosphopantetheine are identical in both the PanK structures, with the exception of residues 266 and 340 involved in hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 2B). The acetyldiphosphopantetheine moiety forms direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions with the protein core. The polar residues involved in hydrogen bonds are from the β strands of one monomer (Bb9–Bb11) and the non-polar residues involved in van der Waals interactions are contributed by the extended loop and Bh10′ of the second monomer (Fig. 2A). Acetyl-CoA was very tightly bound to PanK3 in the structure, consistent with the low IC50 value for acetyl-CoA inhibition of the enzyme (5Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32594-32601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The ATP binding site of PanK3 was modeled on the basis of its structural similarity to the SaPanK·AMP-PNP complex (Protein Data Bank code 2EWS) (17Hong B.-S. Yun M. Zhang Y.-M. Chohnan S. Rock C.O. White S.W. Jackowski S. Park H.-W. Leonardi R. Structure. 2006; 14: 1251-1261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the location of the conserved glycine-rich loop (Fig. 3A). Superposition of the B domain of PanK3 and the corresponding domain of the SaPanK·AMP-PNP complex placed the ATP molecule between the two domains of the human PanKs. The two domains of PanK3 and also PanK1 were in an “open” conformation compared with the “closed” conformation SaPanK·AMP-PNP (Fig. 3A). The binding of the acetyl-CoA kept PanK in the open conformation, characteristic of the ligand-free structures of actin-fold proteins (32Kabsch W. Holmes K.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA was a competitive inhibitor of both PanK1 and PanK3 (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that the binding of acetyl-CoA interfered with the ATP binding by stabilizing the open conformation. Based on the superimposed structures of PanK3·acetyl-CoA and SaPanK·AMP-PNP, the α,β-phosphates of acetyl-CoA and the β,γ-phosphates of ATP occupied the same space (Fig. 3A), explaining the competitive nature of acetyl-CoA and ATP for PanK. Also, we found that a high proportion of purified PanK3 was bound to acetyl-CoA. Heat denaturation of the protein released the bound compound into the supernatant, and analysis of this supernatant by mass spectrometry identified it as acetyl-CoA (Fig. 3D). This indicates that acetyl-CoA remained bound to PanK3 during purification. The Pan binding site was predicted on the basis of the location of bound acetyl-CoA in PanK3.

https://openalex.org/W1982888373,"Cells have a variety of strategies for dealing with misfolded proteins. Heat shock response involves transcriptional induction of chaperones to promote and/or correct folding, and also activation of the ubiquitin/proteasome system to degrade defective proteins. In the secretory pathway, it is primarily luminal misfolded or unassembled proteins that trigger the unfolded protein response which, like heat shock, induces chaperones and components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. To understand cellular response to a misfolded polytopic membrane protein of the secretory pathway, we studied Pma1-D378S, a model ERAD substrate. Expression of misfolded Pma1 induces heat shock response in the absence of increased temperature. Overexpression of <i>HSF1</i>, the transcription factor that mediates heat shock response, increases degradation of Pma1-D378S without temperature upshift. Nevertheless, efficient Pma1-D378S degradation occurs in an <i>hsf1</i> mutant that maintains basal transcription levels but cannot mediate transcriptional activation. Thus, heat shock protein induction enhances but is not necessary for ERAD. The Ssa group of cytoplasmic Hsp70 chaperones is required for ERAD of both Pma1-D378S and another transmembrane ERAD substrate, Ste6*. In the absence of Ssa chaperones, ubiquitination of both substrates is impaired, resulting in stabilization. We suggest a role for Hsp70 cytoplasmic chaperones in recognition by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated ubiquitination machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2067416937,"ICI182,780 (Fulvestrant) is a pure anti-estrogen used in adjuvant therapies of breast cancer. This compound not only inhibits the transcriptional activities of the estrogen receptor-α (ERα) but also induces its proteasome-dependent degradation. The latter activity is believed to be required for the antiproliferative effects of ICI182,780. Estrogen receptor-related receptor-α (ERRα) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that is expressed in a wide range of tissues including breast tumors, in which its high expression correlates with poor prognosis. Although not regulated by any natural ligand, ERRα can be deactivated by the synthetic molecule XCT790. Here we demonstrate that this compound also induces a proteasome degradation of ERRα. We also show that although it does not act directly on the steady-state level of ERα, XCT790 potentiates the ICI182,780-induced ERα degradation. We suggest that treatment with XCT790 could thus enhance the efficacy of ICI182,780 in ERα-dependent pathologies such as breast cancer. ICI182,780 (Fulvestrant) is a pure anti-estrogen used in adjuvant therapies of breast cancer. This compound not only inhibits the transcriptional activities of the estrogen receptor-α (ERα) but also induces its proteasome-dependent degradation. The latter activity is believed to be required for the antiproliferative effects of ICI182,780. Estrogen receptor-related receptor-α (ERRα) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that is expressed in a wide range of tissues including breast tumors, in which its high expression correlates with poor prognosis. Although not regulated by any natural ligand, ERRα can be deactivated by the synthetic molecule XCT790. Here we demonstrate that this compound also induces a proteasome degradation of ERRα. We also show that although it does not act directly on the steady-state level of ERα, XCT790 potentiates the ICI182,780-induced ERα degradation. We suggest that treatment with XCT790 could thus enhance the efficacy of ICI182,780 in ERα-dependent pathologies such as breast cancer.

Gronemeyer H. The Nuclear Receptor Factbook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002Google Scholar). Upon interaction with E2, the ligand binding domain (LBD) of ERα adopts an active conformation that allows the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators and the up-modulation of the expression of target genes, on the promoter of which the receptor binds. ERα and its cognate ligands are involved in several physiological processes such as metabolism, regulation of female reproduction, and bone homeostasis (2Barkhem T. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Am. J. Pharmacogenomics. 2004; 4: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). estrogen receptor-α 17β-estradiol ligand binding domain estrogen receptor-related receptor-α peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ PPARγ coactivator 1α 4-OH-tamoxifen small interfering RNA. estrogen receptor-α 17β-estradiol ligand binding domain estrogen receptor-related receptor-α peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ PPARγ coactivator 1α 4-OH-tamoxifen small interfering RNA. Estrogens are also instrumental in various pathological conditions. For example, breast cancers are often dependent upon estrogens that positively regulate cell proliferation (3Ariazi E.A. Ariazi J.L. Cordera F. Jordan V.C. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 181-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). For this reason, molecules that block the transcriptional activities of ERα in the mammary gland were identified (4Osborne C.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 5Ali S. Coombes R.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). These compounds inhibit E2-induced proliferation and some are widely used in adjuvant therapy in breast cancer. This is the case of 4-OH-tamoxifen (OHT), a mixed antagonist (i.e. that displays agonist or antagonist activity depending on the tissue), or ICI182,780 (Fulvestrant), a pure antagonist. Upon interaction with E2, ERα not only becomes transcriptionally active but is also targeted for degradation by the proteasome machinery (6Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W.

Antagonists affect ERα protein stability in a more complex manner. OHT stabilizes the receptor in an inactive conformation, whereas ICI182,780 induces a rapid degradation of the receptor. Various pathways are identified that contribute to ligand-induced ERα degradation (9Lonard D.M. Nawaz Z. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Mol.

Some of these pathways are required for the antiproliferative activities of ICI182,780 (11Fan M. Bigsby R.M. Nephew K.P. Mol. Endrocrinol. 2003; 17: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Estrogen receptor-related receptor-α (ERRα) is another member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that is identified on the basis of its high level of sequence identity to ERα (1Laudet V. Gronemeyer H. The Nuclear Receptor Factbook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002Google Scholar, 16Giguère V. Yang N. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1988; 331: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). ERRα is involved in the regulation of metabolism in cooperation with the PGC-1α coactivator. Indeed, ERRα regulates lipid and glucose metabolism (17Luo J. Sladek R. Carrier J. Bader J.A. Richard D. Giguère V. Mol. Cell.

The receptor is also essential to the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis exerted by PGC-1α (23Schreiber S.N. Emter R. Hock M.B. Knutti D. Cardenas J. Podvinec M. Oakeley E.J. Kralli A. Proc.

ERRα is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, and its high expression correlates with poor prognosis in breast, colon, and ovarian cancers (25Ariazi E.A. Clark G.M. Mertz J.E.

Chem. 2006; 6: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), although its roles in tumors have not been determined. The transcriptional activities of ERRα are not regulated by estrogens; however, several levels of interference occur between ERRα and estrogen signaling (30Giguère V. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 220-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 31Horard B. Vanacker J.-M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For example, estrogens regulate the expression of ERRα in mouse uteri (32Shigeta H. Zuo W. Yang N. DiAugustine R. Teng C.T. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 19: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); in turn ERRα positively regulates the expression of aromatase (33Yang C. Zhou D. Chen S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5695-5700PubMed Google Scholar), the limiting enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis. Furthermore, ERα and ERRα display complex positive and negative interactions in the transcriptional regulation of common genes, such as osteopontin, lactoferrin, and TFF1/pS2 (34Zhang Z. Teng C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20837-20846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 35Lu D. Kiriyama Y. Lee K.Y. Giguère V.

In vitro far Western experiments show that ERα and ERRα physically interact (39Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5795-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). No natural ligand was identified for ERRα, which is considered an orphan receptor (31Horard B. Vanacker J.-M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies show that this receptor spontaneously adopts an active conformation (40Kallen J. Schlaeppi J.M. Bitsch F. Filipuzzi I. Schilb A. Riou V. Graham A. Strauss A. Geiser M. Fournier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49330-49337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although ERRα regulates transcription in a constitutive manner, some of its activities, such as DNA binding or contact with coactivators, can be regulated by phosphorylation (41Barry J.B. Giguère V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6120-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Compounds such as the phytoestrogen genistein can inhibit the transcriptional activities of ERRα (42Suetsugi M. Su L. Karlsberg K. Yuan Y. Chen S. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 981-991PubMed Google Scholar). Based on its capacity to disrupt the interaction between ERRα and PGC-1α, the synthetic molecule XCT790 is identified as an ERRα specific ligand and acts as an inverse agonist (43Willy P.J. Murray I.R. Qian J. Busch B.B. Stevens W.C. Martin R. Mohan R. Zhou S. Ordentlich P. Wei P. Sapp D.W. Horlick R.A. Heymann R.A. Schulman I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8912-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that XCT790 not only represses the transcriptional activities of ERRα but also induces its proteasome-dependent degradation. Although it does not directly affect ERα stability, XCT790 also potentiates the ICI182,780-induced ERα degradation. This effect is dependent on ERRα and on new protein synthesis, indicating an indirect effect. Treatment with XCT790 may enhance the efficacy of ICI182,780 in diseases involving ERα such as breast cancer. Materials—The following antibodies and reagents were used in this study. Anti-ERRα raised in a rabbit, using a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide mapping a region conserved between mouse and human ERRα but divergent in other ERR subfamily members, was used. Anti-ERα (HC-20) and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Tebu, France) and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Actinomycin D, MG132, cycloheximide, XCT790, E2, and OHT were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and ICI182,780 was purchased from Tocris Cookson Ltd (Bristol, UK). Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The human mammary epithelial cell line MCF7 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Prior to experiments involving treatment with estrogens, cells were cultured in hormone-free medium (phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum for 3 days. In all experiments except for dose response a 5 μm XCT790 concentration was used. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells (105) were seeded in a 24-well plate in hormone-free medium and transfected using 3 μl of Exgen500 (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) with UAS-(Gal4-binding) luciferase reporter constructs, along with Gal4DBD (Gal4) or constructs fusing the Gal4DBD to ERRα- or ERα-LBD (50 ng). CMV-βGal plasmid (50 ng) was added to normalize transfection efficiency, and pSG5 plasmid was added as a carrier up to 500 ng. Six hours later, cells were treated or not with XCT790 or E2 (100 nm) for 48 h and then lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (125 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol, 5% Triton X-100). Luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized based on β-galactosidase levels. Transfections were performed in triplicate. Expression Analysis—RNAs were isolated by guanidinium-thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction. Total RNA was converted to first-stand cDNA using a SuperScript II retro-transcription kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed in a 96-well plate by using the SYBR Green JumpStart kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Data were normalized to 36b4 mRNA. Primers used in this study were: ERRα, 5′-CAAGCGCCTCTGCCTGGTCT-3′ and 5′-ACTCGATGCTCCCCTGGATG-3′; c-Myc, 5′-GCCACGTCTCCACACACTAG-3′ and 5′-TCTTGGCAGCAGGATAGTCCTT-3′; hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, 5′-CTGACCTGCTGGATTACA-3′ and 5′-GCGACCTTGACCATCTTT-3′; and 36B4, 5′-GTCACTGTGCCAGCCCAGAA-3′ and 5′-TCAATGGTGCCCCTGGAGAT-3′. RNA Interference (siRNA)—The ERRα (Dharmacon) and ERα (Fisher Invitrogen) siRNAs were tranfected into MCF7 cells with Oligofectamine and Lipofectamine RNAiMax, respectively, according to manufacturer's protocol (Fisher Invitrogen). Cells were transfected twice with ERRα or ERα siRNA, first in 10-cm plates for 48 h and then in a 6-well plate for 24 h. Cells were then preincubated with XCT790 or ICI182,780 for 48 h and then treated for 16 h with ICI182,780 or XCT790 depending on the first incubation. In other experiments, cells were transfected with siRNA only once for 48 h and treated with drugs as described above. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, MCF7 cells were seeded in 6-well plate (5 × 105) and treated or not with MG132 (4 μm), cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), XCT790, tamoxifen (1 μm), ICI182,780 (1 μm) for the indicated times. Cells were lysed in radioactive immunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) and then centrifuged for 15 min at 13,200 rpm. Proteins were quantified using the Bradford protein assay kit (Pierce, Perbio Science Co.) and boiled for 10 min in Laemmli buffer. Proteins (30 μg) were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). The blots were saturated in TBST (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and then probed with specific antibodies (anti-ERRα, anti-ERα, anti-actin) and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL kit, GE Healthcare) with appropriate specific peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (GE Healthcare). XCT790 Induces ERRα Protein Degradation—To verify that XCT790, an ERRα inverse agonist, specifically inactivated this receptor in human mammary cells, an UAS-Luc reporter plasmid was transfected in MCF7 cells with a Gal4-ERRαLBD fusion plasmid. XCT790 down-regulated the activation driven by the latter construct in a dose-dependent manner, but not in the manner exerted by a Gal4-ERαLBD plasmid (Fig. 1A). We analyzed the effect of XCT790 on ERRα protein expression. As shown by Western blot, XCT790 reduced the amount of ERRα protein in a dose- (Fig. 1B) and time-dependent (Fig. 1C) manner. This effect of XCT790 was transient because the expression of ERRα was restored to its original level 8 h after withdrawal of the drug (Fig. 1D). We established whether XCT790 exerted its effect on ERRα expression at the RNA or protein level. As determined by quantitative PCR, no reduction in the steady-state level of ERRα mRNA was evidenced upon XCT790 treatment even after 48 h (Fig. 2A, left panel). It has been reported that expression of the ERRα gene can be enhanced by its own product (44Laganière J. Tremblay G.B. Dufour C.R. Giroux S. Rousseau F. Giguère V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18504-18510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A reduction of ERRα protein level is expected to result in a drop of ERRα mRNA expression, which could be masked by a high stability of ERRα mRNA. However, when cells were treated with actinomycin D, a global transcriptional inhibitor, the steady-state level of ERRα mRNA was rapidly reduced (Fig. 2A, right panel). The half-life of this mRNA was clearly shorter than 2 h, comparable with that of c-Myc (used as an unstable mRNA control) and well beyond that of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (used as a stable mRNA control). ERRα protein might not participate in the basal expression level of its corresponding mRNA in the conditions used here. Furthermore, XCT790 does not act on ERRα expression at the mRNA level. Treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, blocked the effect of XCT790 (Fig. 2B) indicating that the drug induced the ERRα protein degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Treatment by cycloheximide did not impair the effect of XCT790 (Fig. 2C), implying an accelerated ERRα protein turnover induced by the drug in a direct manner (i.e. new protein synthesis-independent). These data show that the effect of XCT790 on ERRα receptor is comparable with that of ICI182,780 on ERα (i.e. down-regulation of the activity as well as acceleration of receptor degradation). XCT790 Effects on Antagonist-induced ERα Degradation—We next addressed the specificity of action of XCT790. When used alone the drug reduced the expression of ERRα protein but had no effect on ERα (Fig. 3A, left panel). As expected, a 16 h treatment with ICI182,780, an ERα antagonist, reduced the protein expression of ERα, but not ERRα. Strikingly, exposure to both molecules led to a complete disappearance of ERα signal, indicating that XCT790, inactive per se on ERα, greatly potentiated the degradation-inducing effect of ICI182,780. XCT790 acted at the protein level because the steady-state level of ERα mRNA was not modulated (Fig. 3A, right panel). In contrast ICI182,780 treatment was accompanied by an up-modulation of ERα mRNA level, an expected result because ERα is autoregulated in MCF7 cells (45Donaghue C. Westley B.R. May F.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1934-1950PubMed Google Scholar). We next tested the possibility of the converse effect, i.e. an effect of ICI182,780 on XCT790-induced ERRα degradation (Fig. 3B). To this end, we modified the order and length of exposure to the drugs. After 48 h, ICI182,780 reduced the expression of ERα protein but not that of ERRα (Fig. 3B, left panel). XCT790 induced a moderate reduction of ERRα expression, an effect that was dramatically enhanced upon ICI182,780 treatment. Again this potentiation effect was at the protein, but not the mRNA, steady-state level (Fig. 3B, right panel). We concluded that XCT790 and ICI182,780 potentiate the degradation-inducing effect of one another in addition to their direct action on their cognate receptor. In contrast to ICI182,780, OHT, another ERα-antagonist in MCF7 cells, stabilizes ERα, thus leading to an elevation of the steady-state level of the receptor (7Wijayaratne A.L. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35684-35692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). We examined the relationships between OHT and XCT790 (Fig. 3C). Pretreatment with the latter drug did not enhance or reverse the stabilizing effect of OHT on ERα (Fig. 3C, left panel). Similarly, OHT did not enhance the XCT790-induced degradation of ERRα (Fig 3C, right panel). XCT790 Acts Indirectly on ERα Stability in an ERRα-dependent Manner—XCT790 acts on both the transcriptional activity and expression of ERRα protein. It is possible that the modulation of antagonist-induced ERα degradation by XCT790 is because of the absence of ERRα receptor. If so, knocking down ERRα should also result in a potentiation of the ERα-degrading effect of ICI182,780. Transfection of an siRNA directed against ERRα resulted in a nearly complete elimination of the receptor (Fig. 4A, left panel). However, under these conditions ICI182,780 did not display any enhanced ERα-degrading effect as compared with cells transfected with a control siRNA. This indicates that the indirect effect of XCT790 on ERα stability is not simply a consequence of ERRα disappearance. This result also questions the requirement of ERRα in XCT790 effect on ICI182,780-induced ERα degradation. Cells were thus transfected with ERRα-directed siRNA and subsequently treated with XCT790 (Fig. 4A, right panel). Under these conditions, the drug was unable to enhance ICI182,780-induced ERα degradation, indicating that ERRα is absolutely required for the effect of XCT790. We also tested whether the absence of ERα resulted in an enhanced ERRα degradation effect of XCT790. XCT790 was not more potent in inducing ERRα degradation in cells treated with an ERα-targeting siRNA than in siRNA-treated controls (Fig. 4B, left panel). However, ICI182,780 absolutely required ERα to modulate XCT790-induced ERRα degradation (Fig. 4B, right panel). Cross-modulation of ERRα and ERα Stability Requires New Protein Synthesis—The above results show that receptor absence and treatment by antagonist drugs are not equivalent. Furthermore, a pretreatment by a given drug is required to enhance the capacity of the other drug to degrade its cognate receptor (i.e. a cotreatment is inefficient for this promotion, data not shown). This 48-h pretreatment (Fig. 3) could be reduced to 12 h (Fig. 5). This suggests an active role of the drugs in modulating the expression of an intermediate factor involved in receptor stability. To evaluate this possibility, cells were treated with cycloheximide, subsequently with XCT790, and then with ICI182,780 (Fig. 5A). Under these conditions, XCT790 did not up-modulate ERα sensitivity to ICI182,780, indicating that new protein synthesis was required for the indirect effect of XCT790 on ERα. We also performed the converse experiment in which cells were treated with cycloheximide, subsequently with ICI182,780, and then with XCT790 (Fig. 5B). Our results show that ICI182,780 required the new protein synthesis of an intermediate protein to up-modulate ERRα sensitivity to XCT790. XCT790 as an ERRα Degradation-inducing Agent—XCT790, a synthetic compound identified on the basis of its capacity to disrupt the interactions between ERRα and the PGC-1α coactivator, down-regulates the constitutive transcriptional activity of ERRα (43Willy P.J. Murray I.R. Qian J. Busch B.B. Stevens W.C. Martin R. Mohan R. Zhou S. Ordentlich P. Wei P. Sapp D.W. Horlick R.A. Heymann R.A. Schulman I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8912-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The effect has been observed in CV-1 and also in COS1 cells (46Nichol D. Christian M. Steel J.H. White R. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32140-32147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This observation can be extended to other cell types: XCT790 acts as a powerful ERRα inverse agonist in MCF7 and MDA-MB231 cells (this study and data not shown). XCT790 promotes the degradation of ERRα protein. Expression of the corresponding mRNA is unaffected. Induction of cognate receptor protein degradation, independent of any effect on the corresponding mRNA, was demonstrated for other NR/ligand pair such as ERα/ICI182,780 or PPARγ/pioglitazone (47Alarid E.T.

The ERRα mRNA is very unstable (half-life < 2 h), which is consistent with the circadian regulation of its expression in vivo (50Horard B. Rayet B. Triqueneaux G. Laudet V. Delaunay F. Vanacker J.-M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast the ERRα protein is very stable, as its half-life is estimated to be over 24 h based on cycloheximide treatment (data not shown). The ERRα gene is positively auto-regulated (41Barry J.B. Giguère V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6120-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 44Laganière J. Tremblay G.B. Dufour C.R. Giroux S. Rousseau F. Giguère V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18504-18510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Lowering the level of ERRα protein could result in reduction of the level of the corresponding mRNA, a phenomenon we could not observe. However, if ERRα clearly binds to its own promoter in the absence of any given stimulus (41Barry J.B. Giguère V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6120-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), activation of the promoter is only seen in the presence of PGC-1α, a factor that we could not detect in the MCF7 strain we used (data not shown). Another nonexclusive hypothesis is that ERRα activity on its own promoter requires additional factors or stimuli. XCT790 requires the proteasome, but no new protein synthesis, to induce the degradation of ERRα, but the precise mechanism of this degradation remains to be determined. XCT790-induced degradation also requires the N-terminal domain of ERRα, because a deletion mutant lacking this part of the receptor is resistant to this effect (data not shown). It could be hypothesized that the phosphorylation events that occur in this region of the receptor (41Barry J.B. Giguère V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6120-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) may be involved in regulating the stability of ERRα. However, blocking various phosphorylation pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, or PKCδ did not alter the potency of XCT790 (data not shown). The effect of XCT790 on ERRα is comparable with that of ICI182,780 on ERα in that each compound blocks the transcriptional effect of its cognate receptor and induces its proteasome-dependent degradation (7Wijayaratne A.L. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35684-35692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). It is distinct from the effect of OHT, a mixed ERα antagonist that stabilizes ERα. A New Level of Cross-talk between ERα and ERRα—Previous research shows that XCT790 specifically targets ERRα (43Willy P.J. Murray I.R. Qian J. Busch B.B. Stevens W.C. Martin R. Mohan R. Zhou S. Ordentlich P. Wei P. Sapp D.W. Horlick R.A. Heymann R.A. Schulman I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8912-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Consistently, XCT790 did not exert a direct effect on ERα either by modulating transcriptional activity or by modifying its stability. On the contrary, XCT790 potentiated the degradation-inducing effect of ICI182,780 on its cognate receptor in a strictly ERRα-dependent manner. Far Western experiments show that ERRα and ERα could physically interact with each other in vitro (39Yang N. Shigeta H. Shi H. Teng C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5795-5804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It could be that these receptors heterodimerize in vivo and that these contacts could “protect” each other from antagonist-induced degradation. Eliminating one receptor by a degradation-inducing antagonist would result in oversensitivity of the other receptor to its own antagonist. In this respect, we noted that ERRα is more sensitive to XCT790 in MDA-MB231 (ERα-deficient cells) than in MCF7 (ERα-positive cells) (data not shown). However, restoration of ERα expression in the former cells did not yield a reduced sensitivity of ERRα to XCT790. Furthermore, treatment of MCF7 cells with a siRNA directed against one receptor does not result in enhanced sensitivity of the other receptor to its antagonist (Fig. 4). The above hypothesis assumes that ERRα and ERα heterodimerize, a phenomenon that we could not observe by glutathione S-transferase pull-down or by coimmunoprecipitation in vivo (data not shown). Altogether, this suggests that XCT790 plays an indirect but active role (i.e. more than through inducing ERRα degradation) in enhancing the effect of ICI182,780 on ERα degradation. Consistent with this, the effect of XCT790 could only be observed after a minimum 12-h pretreatment time and not upon cotreatment, suggesting additional factors must be produced. This hypothesis was confirmed when cycloheximide treatment blocked the enhancing effect of XCT790. We tested the effect of XCT790 on the expression of factors involved in proteasome-dependent ICI182,780-induced ERα degradation (6Nawaz Z. Lonard D.M. Dennis A.P. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl.

No response to XCT790 was observed for Uba3 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme 3, the catalytic subunit on the NEDD8 pathway), E6AP (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), or UbcH7 (an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) (data not shown). The potentiation of XCT790-induced degradation by ICI182,780 also requires both ERα and new protein synthesis of an unknown factor. ICI182,780 and XCT790 behaved in a similar manner, although it is not known whether the intermediate factor required is identical in both cases. XCT790 potentiates the degradation induced by ICI182,780, but not the degradation induced by E2, the natural agonist of ERα (data not shown). This phenomenon is, however, not intrinsically linked to the antagonist nature of ICI182,780. OHT, which behaves as an ERα antagonist in MCF7 cells, induces ERα stabilization, and this effect could not be reverted by XCT790. ICI182,780 treatment leads to the inhibition of ERα-dependent transcriptional activity. Pretreatment with XCT790 did not enhance this blocking effect (data not shown), indicating that the effect of ICI182,780 on transcription can be separated from that on ERα degradation with only the latter being targeted by XCT790 through ERRα. Our results indicate a new level of interference between ERα and ERRα, in that a destabilizing antagonist to one receptor modulates the degradation of the other induced by a cognate antagonist, although the precise mechanism by which they do so remains to be determined. Possible Consequences in Anti-estrogenic Therapies—ICI182,780 is used in neoadjuvant therapy of breast cancer because it blocks estrogen-dependent cell proliferation. In MCF7 cells, blocking the NEDD8 pathway, an essential component of ICI182,780-induced ERα degradation, reduces the antiproliferative efficacy of the drug, suggesting that receptor degradation is an integral part of the antiproliferative effect (11Fan M. Bigsby R.M. Nephew K.P. Mol. Endrocrinol. 2003; 17: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It can be expected that treatment with XCT790, as potentiating the degradation of ERα induced by ICI182,780, could also enhance the antiproliferative effect of the anti-estrogen. However, in MCF7 cells, pretreatment with XCT790 did not potentiate the negative effect of ICI182,780 on proliferation. Each ERα moiety contacted by ICI182,780 is transcriptionally blocked immediately and rapidly degraded by the proteasome. This “all-or-nothing” approach may not be effective in vivo, particularly with patients with intact tumors. The kinetics of ERα occupancy by ICI182,780 might not be identical in cells and in vivo. A high ERRα expression in breast tumors correlates with poor prognosis. An inverse correlation between ERRα and ERα has been suggested (25Ariazi E.A. Clark G.M. Mertz J.E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6510-6518PubMed Google Scholar) but not confirmed in a larger screen (26Suzuki T. Miki Y. Moriya T. Shimada N. Ishida T. Hirakawa H. Ohuchi N. Sasano H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4670-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Tumors should thus exist that express both ERα and ERRα. For these tumors, our data suggest that pretreatment with XCT790 could induce a component involved in ICI182,780-induced ERα degradation and thereby enhance the efficacy of the latter drug and reduce its efficient dose.

We found that ectopic expression of AP-2β reactivated hTERT promoter-driven reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and endogenous hTERT gene expression in normal cells, enhanced GFP gene expression in lung cancer cells, and prolonged the life span of primary lung bronchial epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of endogenous AP-2β expression by AP-2β gene-specific small interfering RNAs effectively attenuated hTERT promoter-driven GFP expression, suppressed telomerase activity, accelerated telomere shortening, and inhibited tumor cell growth by induction of apoptosis in lung cancer cells.

The elevated expression of hTERT is necessary to transform normal human cells into cancer cells and is regarded as a hallmark of tumorigenesis (14Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100,: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22579) Google Scholar). The hTERT promoter has been showed to be capable of promoting both constitutive hTERT gene and transgene expression selectively in tumors but not in normal cells (15Ducrest A.L. Szutorisz H. Lingner J. Nabholz M. Oncogene. 2002; 21,: 541-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kirkpatrick K.L. Clark G. Ghilchick M. Newbold R.F. Mokbel K. Eur. J. Surg.

Today. 2004; 34,: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This is largely attributed to the unique ability of tumor cells to up-regulate hTERT transcription. The expression of hTERT is tightly regulated by various cellular factors. For example, expression of c-Myc has been shown to induce the expression of hTERT, whereas the expression of SP1 (stimulating protein-1) suppresses it (18Kirkpatrick K.L. Ogunkolade W. Elkak A.E.

Two E-boxes and an activating enhancer-binding protein-2 (AP-2) site in a 320-bp region of the hTERT promoter have been shown to be essential for the transcriptional activity of the hTERT gene in RD rhabdomyosarcoma cells (20Ma H. Urquidi V. Wong J. Kleeman J. Goodison S. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1,: 739-746PubMed Google Scholar). The transforming growth factor-β signaling molecule Smad3 has also been shown recently to participate in regulating hTERT gene transcription by acting as a repressor directly (21Li H. Xu D. Toh B.-H. Liu J.-P. Cell Res. 2006; 16,: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how hTERT is inactivated during development and how it is reactivated during tumorigenesis. We hypothesized that certain cellular regulatory factors that are differentially expressed or specifically bind to the hTERT promoter in either tumor or normal cells regulate cell-selective activation or repression of hTERT expression. In this study, we discovered and identified several potential tumor-specific hTERT promoter-binding proteins by streptavidin-agarose pulldown assay and high-throughout proteomics in human lung cancer cells. One of the proteins we identified is the transcription factor AP-2β, which was detected in the hTERT promoter DNA-protein complexes in nuclear extracts prepared only from lung cancer cells but not from normal cells. human telomerase reverse transcriptase activating enhancer-binding protein-2 reverse transcription green fluorescent protein small interfering RNA non-small cell lung cancer human bronchial epithelial primary human bronchial epithelial cytomegalovirus phosphate-buffered saline mass spectrometry chromatin immunoprecipitation terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling fluorescence-activated cell sorting nonspecific control small interfering RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay. AP-2β is a member of the AP-2 transcription factor family, the members of which bind GC-rich consensus sequences and regulate the expression of many downstream genes. The AP-2 family consists of five different isoforms known as AP-2α, AP-2β, AP-2γ, AP-2δ, and AP-2ϵ. They are encoded by separate genes and have different biologic functions (22Williams T. Admon A.

Decreased expression of AP-2α or AP-2γ has been found in these tumor cells and is associated with disease progression and the metastatic capabilities of the tumors. Restoration of AP-2α or AP-2γ expression reduces tumorigenesis and inhibits tumor cell growth. However, so far, the role of AP-2β in regulating cancer-related gene expression is largely unknown. Here we show that AP-2β specifically bound to the hTERT promoter and activated hTERT promoter-driven gene expression in human cancer cells. In vitro and in vivo DNA-protein binding assays revealed the tumor cell-selective binding of AP-2β to the hTERT promoter. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunoblot analyses also showed high expression of AP-2β at the mRNA and protein levels in various lung cancer cells. Moreover, we found that exogenous overexpression of AP-2β considerably enhanced hTERT promoter-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene expression in human lung cancer cells and reactivated GFP gene expression in normal lung cells cotransfected with AP-2β- and hTERT-GFP-expressing plasmids. However, treatment with AP-2β-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) largely attenuated hTERT promoter-mediated gene expression in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that the AP-2β siRNA could greatly inhibit telomerase activity and tumor cell growth in human lung cancer cells. Because the expression of hTERT is closely related to tumorigenesis and tightly regulated at the transcriptional level, our identification of AP-2β as a tumor-specific hTERT promoter activator suggests that the AP-2β protein might serve as a biomarker for diagnosing cancer or as a cancer therapeutic target by inhibiting hTERT activity and tumor cell growth. Cell Lines—Human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (H1299, A549, and H322) and an immortalized human embryonic kidney cell line (293) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% glutamine. Telomerase-transformed and immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial (HBE) and primary HBE (PHBE) cells (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) were cultured in the medium supplied by the manufacturer according to the instructions provided. Normal human lung fibroblast WI-38 and VA13 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were incubated in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% carbon dioxide. Plasmid Vectors—Recombinant plasmid vectors expressing wild-type AP-2β (driven by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter) and a GFP reporter (driven by a CMV or an hTERT promoter) were used in the transfection experiments. The plasmid vector LacZ, which contains a β-galactosidase gene, was used as a nonspecific negative control. These recombinant plasmid vectors were constructed at our laboratory. DNA-Protein Binding Assay—DNA-protein binding assays were performed using a streptavidin-agarose bead pulldown assay as described previously (39Deng W.-G. Wu K.K. J. Immunol. 2003; 171,: 6581-6588Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40Deng W.-G. Tang S.T. Tseng H.P. Wu K.K. Blood. 2006; 108,: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Briefly, 80-90% confluent cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared. The biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were synthesized by Sigma based on hTERT promoter sequence -378 to +60 or the AP-2 consensus sequence (sense, 5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′). A non-relevant biotinylated sequence (5′-AGAGTGGTCACTACCCCCTCTG-3′) was included as a control. The binding assay was performed by mixing 1 mg of the nuclear proteins, 10 μg of the biotin-labeled DNA oligonucleotides, and 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with shaking. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g in a microcentrifuge for 1 min and washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The bound proteins were eluted for further analysis. Identification of hTERT Promoter-binding Proteins—The hTERT promoter-binding proteins were separated by 4-15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. The protein bands of interest were cut and digested with trypsin on a gel or chip. The digested samples were subjected to peptide mapping and N-terminal amino acid sequencing using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization interfaced with new high-end quad-ruple time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc. Fremont, CA) and other micro-protein sequencing methods. The identities of the proteins were searched and verified via available data bases and software such as TagIdent (ca.expasy.org) for calculated protein pI and mass, ProFound (prowl.rockefella.edu/) for peptide mass, and Biomarker Wizard (Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc.) for MS-based peptide mapping. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—The ChIP assay was done as described previously (39Deng W.-G. Wu K.K. J. Immunol. 2003; 171,: 6581-6588Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40Deng W.-G. Tang S.T. Tseng H.P. Wu K.K. Blood. 2006; 108,: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1% formaldehyde was added to the culture medium; after incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped, and lysed for 10 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, and aprotinin). Lysates were sonicated three times for 10 s each, and the debris was removed by centrifugation. One-third of the lysate was used as the DNA input control. The remaining two-thirds of the lysate was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA), followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with anti-AP-2β antibody or non-immune rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoprecipitated complexes were collected using protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The precipitates were extensively washed and incubated in elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) at room temperature for 20 min. Cross-linking of DNA-protein complexes was reversed at 65 °C for 5 h, followed by treatment with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 3 h at 50 °C. The DNA was extracted three times with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Pellets were resuspended in Tris/EDTA buffer and subjected to PCR amplification using specific hTERT promoter primers (5′-primer, -378TGGCCCCTCCCTCGGGTTAC-359; and 3′-primer, +60CCAGGGCTTCCCACGTGCGC+41). The resulting product of 438 bp for the hTERT promoter was separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Transient Transfection—The cells were transfected with N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxyl)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammoniummethyl sulfate/cholesterol-encapsulated plasmid DNA nano-particles. In brief, 2 μl of N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxyl)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammoniummethyl sulfate/cholesterol and 4 μg of plasmid DNA were mixed, and the mixture was slowly added to each well in a 6-well plate and incubated for 72 h. The GFP-expressing plasmid vector was used a transfection control to assess the transfection efficiency. The transfection efficiency was in the range of 40-60% in these cell lines. Western Blot Analysis—Western blots were probed with a specific antibody to AP-2, general transcription factor IIB, or β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated using TriReagent RNA isolation reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots (1 μg) of total RNA were used to produce cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)15 primer (Roche Applied Science) in a final volume of 20 μl. The cDNA products (1 μl) obtained were used for the PCR amplification of AP-2β. The sense and antisense primers used for AP-2β were as follows -378TGGCCCCTCCCTCGGGTTAC-359 (5′-primer) and +60CCAGGGCTTCCCACGTGCGC+41 (3′-primer), respectively. The 438-bp DNA fragment amplified by PCR was obtained. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 5 min; 30 amplification cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products from each sample were subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. Cell Viability and Apoptosis Assay—Cell growth inhibition and apoptosis analysis was performed as described previously (41Ueda K. Kawashima H. Ohtani S. Deng W. Ravoori M. Bankson J. Gao B. Girard L. Minna J.D. Roth J.A. Kundra V. Ji L. Cancer Res. 2006; 66,: 9682-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cell viability was analyzed by counting viable cells using a trypan blue exclusion assay. The percentage of viable cells was calculated in terms of the number of treated cells relative to the number of control cells. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-based fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) assay. The relative number of apoptotic cells was calculated in terms of the TUNEL-positive values in cells. Experiments were repeated three times with quadruplicate samples for each treatment in each experiment. siRNAs—The siRNAs expressing vector were prepared with a transcription-based method using a Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). The sequences of 21-nucleotide sense and antisense RNAs were as follows: siAP-2β-1, 5′-GCUGUUCACUUAGCUAGGGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCUAGCUAAGUGAACAGCTT-3′ (antisense) for the AP-2β gene (-998 to -978); siAP-2β-2, 5′-GCUGUUCACUUAGCUAGGGTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCCUAGCUAAGUGAACAGCTT-3′ (antisense); and nonspecific control siRNA (siNSC), 5′-AAUGGUCCGAAUCUAGUGUUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAAAACACUAGAUUCGGACCA-3′ (antisense) (as a nonspecific control scrambled siRNA). These siRNAs were prepared with a transcription-based method using the Silencer siRNA construction kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Oligofectamine reagent. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The AP-2 consensus oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′; and antisense, 5′-CAGGGCCGCGGGCGGTCAGTTCGATC-3′) were obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The hTERT promoter oligonucleotides with an AP-2-binding site (-43 to -18) were synthesized by Sigma. The probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 kinase (Promega Corp.). EMSA was prefomed by incubating 10 μg of nuclear extract with a labeled probe (10,000 cpm, ∼10 fmol) in binding buffer containing 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC). To assess the specificity of DNA-protein binding, up to a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type or mutant oligonucleotide was added. The mixture was applied to 4% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 300 V for 45 min, and the complex was detected by autoradiography. Telomerase Activity Assays—Telomerase activity was analyzed by a highly sensitive qualitative photometric enzyme immunoassay utilizing the telomeric repeat amplification protocol with a TeloTAGGG telomerase PCR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Telomere Length Assay—Telomere length was measured by a highly sensitive nonradioactive chemiluminescence assay utilizing Southern blot analysis of terminal restriction fragments obtained by digestion of genomic DNA with frequently cutting restriction enzymes (HinfI/RsaI) with a TeloTAGGG telomere PCR length assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Telomeric smears were revealed by exposure on x-ray film. Statistical Analyses—All experiments were performed at least three times with triplicate samples. Analysis of variance and Student's t test were used to compare the values of the test and control samples in vitro and in vivo. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. StatView 5.0 (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA) and SAS software were used for all statistical analyses. The significance was evaluated by the paired t test. Detection and Identification of Tumor-specific hTERT Promoter-binding Proteins—The streptavidin-agarose bead pulldown assay is a useful and feasible approach for detecting DNA-binding proteins such as transcription activators and coactivators (42Deng W.-G. Zhu Y. Montero A. Wu K.K. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323,: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we also used this technique to discover and detect the tumor-specific cellular protein factors that specifically bind to the hTERT promoter. We designed and synthesized a 438-bp biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the 5′-flanking sequence of the hTERT gene from -378 to +60 as a DNA probe (Fig. 1A) to assess the binding of cellular protein factors to the hTERT promoter region. Nuclear extracts prepared from human lung cancer cells (H1299, A549, and H322) and normal lung cell lines (HBE, WI-38, and VA13) were incubated with the 5′-biotinylated hTERT promoter probe to form a DNA-protein complex, and the nuclear proteins that specifically bound to the hTERT probe were pulled down using streptavidin-agarose beads. The nuclear extract prepared from 293 cells, which possess a high intrinsic hTERT activity, was used as a positive control. After elution, the hTERT promoter-binding proteins were separated by 4-20% SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. As shown in Fig. 1B, one of the protein bands (at ∼48 kDa) was detected mainly in the 293 and lung cancer cell lines but not in the normal lung cell lines. These results indicate that certain nuclear proteins in lung cancer cells specifically bind to the hTERT promoter. To identify the candidate tumor cell-selective hTERT promoter-binding proteins, we used a proteomics approach with ProteinChip array-based surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization MS to profile and analyze the hTERT promoter-binding proteins. The protein band of interest was dissected from the gel and digested with trypsin. We next analyzed the peptide digests by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization MS and identified the protein candidate by peptide mapping with an Internet-based proteomics tool. The tumor-specific hTERT promoter-binding protein (Fig. 1B, arrow) was predicted to be the transcription factor AP-2β. We further performed computer-aided transcription factor-binding site analysis and found a consensus AP-2-binding site in the hTERT promoter. Validation of AP-2β as a Tumor-specific hTERT Promoter-binding Protein—To verify that AP-2β is a tumor cell-selective hTERT promoter-binding protein, we performed immunoblot analyses with the complexes consisting of nuclear proteins, the hTERT promoter probe, and streptavidin-agarose beads using anti-AP-2β antibody. A small biotinylated oligonucleotide probe that does not harbor any known regulatory element was included as a probe control in each experiment. Antibodies against von Willebrand factor (a plasma protein) and AP-2α (an isoform of the AP-2 family) were used as negative and nonspecific positive controls, respectively. We clearly detected the AP-2β proteins in the complexes prepared from the human lung cancer cell lines H1299, A549, and H322 and from the immortalized 293 cells but not from the normal lung cell lines HBE and WI-38 (Fig. 2A), demonstrating the tumor cell-selective binding of AP-2β to the hTERT promoter. However, we detected the binding of AP-2α to the hTERT promoter probe"

In this study, we solved the crystal structure of TJL complexed with a trimer of N-acetylglucosamine to 1.6Å resolution. Based on structure and mutation analyses, we demonstrated that Glu-18 and Asp-30 are the catalytic residues of TJL. Furthermore, the present findings suggest that the catalytic mechanism of TJL is a retaining mechanism that proceeds through a covalent sugar-enzyme intermediate. On the other hand, the quaternary structure in the crystal revealed a dimer formed by the electrostatic interactions of catalytic residues (Glu-18 and Asp-30) in one molecule with the positive residues at the C terminus in helix 6 of the other molecule. Gel chromatography analysis revealed that the TJL dimer remained intact under low salt conditions but that it dissociated to TJL monomers under high salt conditions. With increasing salt concentrations, the chitinase activity of TJL dramatically increased. Therefore, this study provides novel evidence that the lysozyme activity of TJL is modulated by its quaternary structure.

A known bacteriolytic enzyme, lysozyme (EC 3.2.1.17), is widely distributed throughout the animal and plant kingdom. Several types of lysozyme have been described to date as follows: chicken, goose, bacteria, plant, and phage. Recently, there has been increasing interest in a new type of lysozyme, i.e. invertebrate-type (i-type) 4The abbreviations used are:i-typeinvertebrate-typeHELhen egg white lysozymeHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMALDI-TOF MSmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometryNAGN-acetylglucosaminePNPp-nitrophenylTJLT. japonica lysozymePDBProtein Data Bank lysozyme. The existence of this new type of lysozyme was proposed as early as 1975 (1Jolles J. Jolles P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 54: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A lysozyme composed of 123 amino acids (13.8 kDa) was recently isolated from the marine bivalve Tapes japonica and was shown to be an i-type lysozyme (2Ito Y. Yoshikawa A. Hotani T. Fukuda S. Sugimura K. Imoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This was the first lysozyme to be identified as an i-type lysozyme based on determination of the complete amino acid sequence at the protein level. Furthermore, several lysozymes have been identified, including those from the following organisms: two coastal bivalves belonging to the genus Mytilus (3Jolles J. Fiala-Medioni A. Jolles P. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 43: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), four deep-sea bivalves belonging to the genera Bathymodiolus and Calyptogena (3Jolles J. Fiala-Medioni A. Jolles P. J. Mol.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In 2002, alignment and phylogenic analyses using six bivalve lysozymes suggested that i-type lysozymes form a monophyletic family (7Bachali S. Jager M. Hassanin A. Schoentgen F. Jolles P.

Because the primary sequences of i-type lysozymes are not homologous to those of any other types of lysozyme, the tertiary structure cannot be constructed. invertebrate-type hen egg white lysozyme high performance liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry N-acetylglucosamine p-nitrophenyl T. japonica lysozyme Protein Data Bank Interestingly, the lytic activity of bivalve lysozymes has been shown to be very sensitive to the ionic strength of a solution. With increasing salt concentrations, oyster and blue mussel lysozyme activity against Micrococcus lysodeikticus was activated and increased until exposure to a 0.1 m salt solution had been reached; at higher salt concentrations, lysozymatic activity then decreased (13Mchenery J.G. Birkbeck T.H. Allen J.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1979; 63: 25-28Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14Xue Q.G. Itoh N. Schey K.L. Li Y.L. Cooper R.K. La Peyre J.F. Cell. Mol.

The latter, decreasing activity under higher salt conditions, might have been introduced by the weakness of the electrostatic interactions between negative charges on the bacterial cell surface and the positive charges of the lysozyme. However, the mechanism of salt-dependent activation up to a 0.1 m concentration remains unclear. In this study, we report the first x-ray crystallographic structure of an i-type lysozyme, T. japonica lysozyme (TJL), complexed with a substrate analogue, a trimer of N-acetylglucosamine. Based on crystallographic results and biochemical analyses, we determined the active residues and the catalytic mechanism of TJL. Moreover, we demonstrated that TJL activity is salt concentration-dependent, and this dependence reflected changes in the quaternary structure of TJL. Preparation and Crystallization—TJL was overproduced and purified as described in our previous paper (16Takeshita K. Hashimoto Y. Thujihata Y. So T. Ueda T. Iomoto T. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 36: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Lyophilized TJL (6.6 mg/ml) was dissolved in 100 mm sodium acetate containing 3.3 mg/ml of trimer of N-acetylglucosamine ((NAG)3). The conditions for crystallizations of the complex were screened using screen kits, such as Crystal Screen I and II (Hampton Research) and Wizard I and II (Emerald Biostructure). Finally, a crystal suitable for crystallographic analysis was obtained by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method. A 1-μl droplet of protein was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution and incubated at 20 °C over 3 days. The reservoir solution consisted of 0.8 m citric buffer (pH 5) containing 0.5 m ammonium sulfate and 0.5 mm n-heptyl-β-d-glucoside. The reservoir volume was 200 μl. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—For preparation of heavy metal derivatives, crystals of TJL were soaked for 10 min at room temperature in the reservoir solution containing 100 μm K2PtCl4 or 10 μm K2OsO4. The crystals were immediately transferred to cryoprotectant solution (reservoir solution containing 10% (v/v) glucose). Native crystals were also soaked in the cryoprotectant solution. X-ray diffraction data of platinum derivative was collected at 100 K using the synchrotron radiation (λ = 0.979041) at the BL38B1 station of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) and Jupiter 210. X-ray diffraction data of native and osmium derivatives were collected using PROTEUM R (Bruker). Data were processed using HKL2000 (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The platinum locations were directly determined by the program SnB (18Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and the osmium locations were determined by the program SOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Platinum and osmium parameters were refined using the program SOLVE, and phases were improved with the program RESOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Because data quality of platinum data is better than native data, we use platinum data for structural refinement. The initial model was built by the auto model building programs ARP/wARP (21Cohen S.X. Morris R.J. Fernandez F.J. Ben Jelloul M. Kakaris M. Parthasarathy V. Lamzin V.S. Kleywegt G.J. Perrakis A.

Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 36: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The yields of E18A and D30A were 1.5 and 2.1 mg/liter, respectively. The tertiary structure of mutant proteins was checked by CD spectrometry before the experiments. The molar ellipticity of mutant was identical to that of wild-type TJL. Determination of Configuration of the Catalytic Products—Ten microliters of 50 μm (NAG)n (n = 3-6) was mixed with 90 μl of 7 μm lysozyme solution, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for each incubation time. Aliquots (50 μl) are analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Mightysil RP-18 GP column (4.6 × 250 mm, Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) with a 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid eluent at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The elution of oligomer of NAG was detected by absorbance at 210 nm. The ratio of anomers of NAG was determined by calculating the area of eluted peaks. Analysis of Lysozyme Catalytic Products—Lysozymes (0.7 μm) and hexamers of NAG (5 μm) were incubated with 20 mm glycine buffer at pH 3.0 containing 100 mm NaCl and 37 °C for 4 h. The solutions (0.5 μl) were mixed with 1 μl of matrix solutions (saturated sinapinic acid in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile). The mixture was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (Voyager RP spectrometer, PerSeptive Biosystems). Chitinase Activity—Lysozymes were incubated at 40 °C for 1 h under various conditions. We mixed 45 μl of p-nitrophenyl penta-N-acetyl-β-chitopentaoside (PNP-(NAG)5) (1 mm) dissolved in aqueous solution with 15 μl of lysozyme solution. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn from the reaction mixture at the appropriate incubation intervals and analyzed by HPLC using a YMC-Pack A-014 column (6 × 300 mm) with an acetonitrile/water (80:20) eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The elution of PNP-(NAG)5 was detected by absorbance at 300 nm. The concentration of PNP-(NAG)5 was determined by calculating the area of an eluted peak. Gel Chromatography—Lysozymes (3.5 mg/ml) were incubated with the eluted buffer (50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, containing 83 or 500 mm NaCl). Forty five μl of lysozyme solutions were loaded onto a column (7.5 × 600 mm, TSK-GEL G3000SWXL; TOSOH). The lysozymes were eluted with 50 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing 83 or 500 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The eluted proteins were monitored at 280 nm absorbance. Overall Structure and Interaction between TJL and (NAG)3—The crystal structure of TJL was determined at 1.6 Å resolution. The structure was refined with good bond geometry and crystallographic quality statistics. The Ramachandran plot produced by PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) revealed that 92-93% of the residues are in the most favored regions and 7% are in additional allowed regions. The structure refinement statistics are shown in Table 2. The crystal structure of TJL is characterized by six α-helices and one β-sheet (Fig. 1). This enzyme is a unique protein that contains 14 cysteines in the small molecule (123 amino acid residues). This was the first study to reveal that all of the cysteines in TJL form disulfide bonds (Fig. 1). In the crystal structure, the Fo - Fc omit electron density map of (NAG)3 was clearly observed (Fig. 2). As expected, the sugar moiety in (NAG)3 is fixed in the large cleft in TJL by several hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table 1). The involvement of hydrogen bonding in the interaction with the substrate analogue has also been observed in the goose-type lysozyme complex with (NAG)3 (9Weaver L.H. Grutter M.G. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, the sugar moiety was fixed by van der Waals forces and hydrophobic interactions involving Pro-44, Tyr-45, Tyr-77, His-94, and Pro-98 in TJL. The residues involved in hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction with substrate were conserved among other i-type lysozymes (Fig. 3). Therefore, these residues may play an important role in the interaction with the substrate in i-type lysozymes.FIGURE 3Secondary structure and sequence alignment of i-type lysozymes and hen egg white lysozyme.

According to the DALI search results, we compared the TJL and hen egg white lysozyme (HEL, PDB code 1HEW) structures, as these structures are representative lysozyme folds. The overall structure in HEL and TJL were similar (Fig. 4A). The secondary structural arrangement of α2-, α3-, α4-helices, and β-sheet in HEL were consistent with that of α1-, α3-, and α4-helices and β-sheet in TJL, respectively (Figs. 3 and 4B). A previous report suggested that the chitinase and lysozyme families have a conserved fold containing catalytic residues (31Monzingo A.F. Marcotte E.M. Hart P.J. Robertus J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this conserved fold, the secondary structure arrangements of the two families are similar, and the hydrophobic interactions between each of the elements in the secondary structures are very similar as well (31Monzingo A.F. Marcotte E.M. Hart P.J. Robertus J.D. Nat. Struct.

Open table in a new tab In both lysozymes, several residues contributed to hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions against (NAG)3. In particular, His-94 in TJL was overlaid on Trp-108 in HEL, which is conserved among c-type lysozymes, based on a comparison of the tertiary structures of TJL and HEL (Fig. 4B). Phillips and co-workers (32Phillips D.C. Sci. Am. 1966; 215: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) demonstrated that HEL has six subsets for the binding of an oligomer of N-acetylglucosamine, and they designated these subsites A-F. (NAG)3 is reported to bind to subsites A-C in HEL (32Phillips D.C. Sci. Am. 1966; 215: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Similarly, in this study, it was found that (NAG)3 bound to subsites A-C in TJL. In both lysozymes, (NAG)3 was located in the large cleft, which is formed by commonly conserved folds (Fig. 4B) (31Monzingo A.F. Marcotte E.M. Hart P.J. Robertus J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, the structure of the i-type lysozymes appears to possess a conserved fold in the lysozyme family. S-S bond formations in TJL were conserved in i-type lysozyme family but differed markedly from those in HEL (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the secondary structure arrangement in the C-terminal region (residues 79-123) differed significantly from those of HEL (Fig. 4A). The hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal helical region were conserved in the i-type lysozyme family (Fig. 3). Therefore, these S-S bond formations and the structure of the C-terminal region in TJL were also found to be unique among lysozyme families. Catalytic Residues and Catalytic Mechanism of TJL—The catalytic residues in HEL are Glu-35 in the α2-helix and Asp-52 in the β2-strand (32Phillips D.C. Sci. Am. 1966; 215: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Based on the folding similarity of HEL and TJL, Glu-35 in HEL corresponds to Glu-18 in TJL, respectively (Fig. 3 and 4B). The amino acid residues corresponding to Glu-18 in TJL are conserved in other i-type lysozymes (Fig. 3). Among all lysozymes and members of the chitinase family, the glutamate residue is conserved as a catalytic residue (31Monzingo A.F. Marcotte E.M. Hart P.J. Robertus J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To confirm whether Glu-18 is a catalytic residue, we prepared mutant TJLs in which Glu-18 was mutated to Ala, and we examined the activities of the E18A mutants against PNP-(NAG)5 at 40 °C. We found that the E18A mutants exhibited no lysozyme activity (Table 4). These results demonstrate that Glu-18 is indeed a catalytic residue in TJL. In the crystal structure of TJL, Asp-30 was proximal to Glu-18 (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the amino acid residues corresponding to Asp-30 in TJL were conserved in the other i-type lysozymes (Fig. 3). However, for the location of aspartic acid, Asp-30 in TJL is located in β1, whereas Asp-52 in HEL is located in β2 (Fig. 3 and 4B). Therefore, we prepared mutant TJL in which Asp-30 was mutated to Ala, and we examined the activity of the D30A mutant on PNP-(NAG)5 at 40 °C. In fact, the D30A mutation did not show any lysozyme activity (Table 4), indicating that Asp-30 plays a pivotal role in the catalytic mechanism of TJL.TABLE 4Chitinase activities of wild-type TJL and its mutantsTJLActivity%Wild type100E18A<0.1D30A<0.1 Open table in a new tab Catalytic mechanisms have been proposed for members of the lysozyme family (Fig. 5B) (33Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1492) Google Scholar, 34Svensson B. Sogaard M. J. Biotechnol. 1993; 29: 1-37Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). An inverting mechanism (Fig. 5B, upper panel) and two retaining mechanisms that proceed through either an oxocarbonium ion intermediate (Fig. 5B, middle panel) or a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate (Fig. 5B, lower panel) were proposed previously. The inverting mechanism and the retaining mechanism led to hydrolysis of the NAG oligomer to yield two different anomers, i.e. the α-anomer or β-anomer, respectively (Fig. 5B). To determine the catalytic mechanism of TJL, we analyzed the anomerization of sugar produced by TJL. In this study, we observed that the α- and β-anomers derived from a trimer to a hexamer of authentic NAG could be completely separated by reverse phase-HPLC (Fig. 5C). Fig. 5C also shows the HPLC profile of authentic (NAG)4. A previous paper reported that the ratio of the α-anomer to the β-anomer derived from the authentic NAG was ∼6:4, as based on the HPLC separation results (35Fukamizo T. Hayashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 91: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The ratio of the former peak to the latter in structures derived from (NAG)4 anomers was 4:6; therefore, we determined that the β-anomer was eluted more rapidly upon HPLC separation. Hydrolysis of (NAG)6 by HEL gave the β-anomer of (NAG)4 (36Dahlquist F.W. Borders Jr., C.L. Jacobson G. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After hydrolysis of (NAG)6 by HEL for 10 min, the reaction mixture was injected onto an HPLC column. Because the ratio of the α-anomer to the β-anomer of (NAG)4 is 3:7 (Fig. 5C), it was confirmed that the β-anomer was primarily produced by the hydrolysis of HEL. After incubation of the reaction mixture for 3 h, conversion between the α- and β-anomers occurred, such that the peak ratio of the α-anomer to the β-anomer reached 6:4 (Fig. 5C). This result was also consistent with the findings of a previous study (35Fukamizo T. Hayashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 91: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the other hand, after hydrolysis of (NAG)6 by TJL for 1 h, the ratio of the α-anomer to the β-anomer was 3:7 (Fig. 5C). Therefore, we found that the β-anomer was primarily produced by TJL hydrolysis, which suggested that TJL is a retaining enzyme. Furthermore, we analyzed HEL and TJL after sugar hydrolysis using MALDI-TOF MS. The lysozymes and (NAG)6 were mixed in 0.02 m glycine buffer (pH 3.0). The mass spectrum of HEL showed a single mass ion peak of 14,324.3 (Fig. 5D, upper panel), which was derived from the HEL monomer (the estimated molecular weight based on the amino acid sequence was 14,313.1). On the other hand, the mass spectrum of TJL showed a monomer ion peak of 13,879.4 (the estimated molecular weight based on the amino acid sequence was 13,860.1), and another additional peak of 14,695.7 was also observed (Fig. 5D, lower panel). The difference between the two ion masses (816.3) approximately corresponded to the mass of the dehydrated (NAG)4 (the estimated molecular weight of 818), and we found that the additional peak was derived from the covalent TJL-(NAG)4 complex produced during the TJL hydrolysis of (NAG)6. Based on the above results, we surmised that TJL is a retaining enzyme that proceeds through a covalent enzyme-sugar intermediate. This is the first example of a wild-type lysozyme forming a covalent bond intermediate in the course of hydrolysis during a catalytic reaction involving a natural substrate.

However, the underlying enzymology of several key tailoring steps that give rise to its structural features remain unresolved, including cyclization of the tetracyclic scaffold and C-methylation of C-6 to afford the key intermediate 6-methylpretetramid (Fig. 1).

During tetracycline biosynthesis, the C-9 reduced decaketide backbone first undergoes C-7/C-12 intramolecular aldol condensation to fix the regioselectivity of the D ring followed by three sequential cyclization reactions to form a fully aromatized, tetracyclic intermediate pretetramid (Fig. 1). Biosynthesis of aureolic acids such as mithramycin presumably follows identical cyclization patterns, as inferred from the structure of premithramycinone, an early intermediate during mithramycin biosynthesis (17Rohr J. Weissbach U. Beninga C. Kunzel E. Siems K. Bindseil K.U. Lombo F. Prado L. Brana A.F. Mendez C. Salas J.A. Chem. Commun. 1998; : 437-438Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The biochemical basis of the C-1/C-18 cyclization reaction, which affords the last rings in both tetracycline and mithramycin, is not well understood. Combinatorial biosynthesis using mithramycin and tetracenomycin biosynthetic genes indicated that MtmX may function as a fourth ring cyclase (18Kunzel E. Wohlert S.E. Beninga C. Haag S. Decker H. Hutchinson C.R. Blanco G. Mendez C. Salas J.A. Rohr J. Chem.-Eur. J. 1997; 3: 1675-1678Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), although no direct biochemical evidence is available. The oxy gene cluster encodes an MtmX homologue, OxyI, which may be involved in A ring cyclization. Compounds in the anthracycline family, such as daunorubicin, undergo identical cyclization reactions to fix the first three rings (Fig. 1) (19Hautala A. Torkkell S. Raty K. Kunnari T. Kantola J.

Formation of the fourth, non-aromatic ring to yield alkaviketone during daunorubicin biosynthesis is catalyzed by the aklanonic acid methyl ester cyclase DnrD via distinct C-2/C-19 connectivity (20Kendrew S.G.

The tetracenomycin family of compounds is constructed from fully aromatized intermediate tetracenomycin F1, but the regioselectivities are significantly different, starting with the first cyclization, which occurs between C-9 and C-14. The fourth ring cyclization takes place between C-2/C-19 and is catalyzed by a dedicated cyclase TcmI (22Thompson T.B. Katayama K. Watanabe K. Hutchinson C.R. Rayment I. J. Biol.

Another important structural feature of tetracyclines is a methyl group installed on C-6 of second ring. The methylation modification occurs relatively early during tetracycline biosynthesis as evidenced by isolation of the intermediate 6-methylpretetramid (Fig. 1) (8McCormick J.R.D. Jensen E.R.

The C-methylation reaction is likely catalyzed by one of two methyltransferases in the oxy gene cluster (OxyF and OxyT), both containing putative S-adenosylmethionine binding domains. C-Methyltransferases are found infrequently among bacterial type II PKSs, including MtmMII in the mithramycin gene cluster (24Lozano M.J. Remsing L.L. Quiros L.M. Brana A.F. Fernandez E. Sanchez C.

All these C-methyltransferases modify the respective aromatic aglycons with unique regiospecificity. Therefore, identification and reconstitution of the dedicated 6-methyltransferase in the oxytetracycline biosynthetic pathway will add to the molecular toolbox of tailoring enzymes. Gene disruption through homologous recombination followed by structure elucidation of the metabolites produced by the mutants has been widely used to access enzyme functions in polyketide biosynthetic pathways. However, gene inactivation has been demonstrated to be of limited use in studying oxytetracycline biosynthesis in S. rimosus. Genomic deletions of oxyK (28Petkovic H. Thamchaipenet A. Zhou L.H.

Waterman P.G. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2005; 58: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and the resulting phenotypes cannot be directly associated with the functions of the deleted genes. The exact causes for biosynthesis of these truncated compounds in S. rimosus mutants are not understood. Purification of target enzymes followed by in vitro biochemical characterizations are complicated by the inaccessibility of the substrates for the cyclization and methylation reactions of interest here. As a result of these technical difficulties, investigation of these early tailoring reactions can be performed through the systematic and incremental reconstitution of the pathway in a heterologous host. Using a heterologous Streptomyces host and shuttle vectors containing different combinations of oxy genes, we recently reported the biosynthesis of novel amidated polyketides by coexpressing the oxy minimal PKS and OxyD (16Zhang W.J. Ames B.D. Tsai S.C. Tang Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Zhang W. Watanabe K. Wang C.C. Tang Y. J. Nat. Prod. 2006; 69: 1633-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These studies verified that the amidotransferase homologue OxyD is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the amidated tetracycline backbone. The main goal of this work is to elucidate the enzymes involved in formation of the tetracyclic scaffold and C-methylation of the aromatic aglycon. We compiled the minimal set of enzymes required to reconstitute 6-methylpretetramid biosynthesis in the heterologous host. These results will enable additional investigation of oxytetracycline downstream tailoring steps and lead to the rational and combinatorial biosynthesis of tetracycline analogs. Bacterial Strains and General Techniques for DNA Manipulation—Streptomyces coelicolor strain CH999 (32McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Science. 1993; 262: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) was used as a host for transformation of shuttle vectors. Protoplast preparation and polyethylene glycol-assisted transformation were performed as described by Hopwood et al. (33Hopwood D. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J.

Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) was used for the manipulation of plasmid DNA. PCR was performed using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR products were first cloned into a pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen) followed by DNA sequencing. Unmethylated DNA was obtained using the methylase-deficient strain GM2163 (New England Biolabs). T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) was used for ligation of restriction fragments. The cosmid clone pYT264, which harbors the entire oxy gene cluster (16Zhang W.J. Ames B.D. Tsai S.C. Tang Y. Appl. Environ.

For LC/MS and analytical HPLC analysis, a well pigmented plate was chopped into fine pieces and extracted with 50 ml of ethyl acetate (EA)/methanol (MeOH)/acetic acid (89%/10%/1%). Extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was dissolved in 0.5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The polyketide products were separated by reverse-phase HPLC and detected at 280 and 410 nm using an analytical C18 column (Varian Pursuit 5 μm, 250 mm × 4.6 mm) with a linear gradient of 5% acetonitrile (CH3CN) in water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to 95% CH3CN in water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 30 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. HPLC retention times (tR) were as follows: WJ83T1 (1), 26.4 min; WJ83Q2 (2a/b), 17.8 min; WJ83Q3 (3), 29.0 min; WJ83Q1 (4), 16.2 min; desmethylaklanonic acid (5), 22.8 min; WJ119 (6), 22.5 min; DMAC, 20.5 min. Spectroscopic Analysis—High resolution mass spectrometry was performed at the Vincent Coates Foundation Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at Stanford University using a Micromass Q-Tof hybrid quadrupole-time of flight LC-MS. NMR spectra were obtained on Bruker DRX-500 and DRX-600 spectrometers at the NMR facility in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UCLA. 1H and 13C chemical shifts were referenced to the solvent peak (Me2SO-d6) δ 2.49 and 39.5 ppm, respectively. Standard parameters were used for one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments, which included 1H,13C, nuclear Overhauser effect, heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (1H,13C), and heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (1H,13C). Isolation of WJ83T1 (1) from S. coelicolor CH999/pWJ83—One hundred R5 plates (3 liter) streaked with CH999/pWJ83 were incubated at 30 °C for 10 days. The plates were chopped into fine pieces and extracted with 3 liter of EA/MeOH/acetic acid (94%/5%/1%). The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was partially dissolved in 100 ml of MeOH. The methanol-insoluble fraction collected by filtration was dissolved in 5 ml Me2SO, filtered, and purified with a preparative reverse-phase HPLC column (SunFire Prep C18 OBD column, 5 μm, 19 × 50 mm). A 20-40% CH3CN in water (10 mm triethylamine) gradient was used over 30 min with a flow rate of 3 ml/min to give purple fractions containing 1 with a retention time of 13.8 min. The eluent was extracted with ethyl acetate and dried in vacuo to give pure solid 1 (approximate yield of 55 mg/liter). WJ83T1 (1): HR-ESIMS m/z = 364.0450 (C19H10 NO7 [M-H]-, 364.0457 calculated); UV (CH3CN/H2O/trifluoroacetic acid) λmax, 278 and 500 nm; see supplemental Table S1 for NMR spectral data. Isolation of WJ83Q1-3 from S. coelicolor CH999/pWJ83—From the same extract as above, the methanol soluble fraction was dried in vacuo and redissolved in 5 ml of EA. The residue was first chromatographed on a normal-phase silica gel (150 g) column and eluted with ethyl acetate in 1% acetic acid to give two impure fractions containing 3 and 4 (Rf values if 0.72 and 0.3, respectively). Further purification of 3 and 4 were achieved on a preparative reverse-phase HPLC column (XTerra Prep MS C18 OBD column, 5 μm, 19 × 50 mm), and a 30-80% CH3CN in water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) gradient was used over 45 min with a flow rate of 3 ml/min. 4 and 3 crystallized as pure yellow/orange needles after elution from the column, with retention times of 8.6 and 17.8 min and approximate yields of 5 and 2 mg/liter, respectively. The MeOH-soluble fraction of the crude extract was also directly applied to the preparative reverse-phase HPLC column to give pure 2 (approximate yield of 8 mg/liter with retention time of 11.2 min at the same gradient as above). WJ83Q2 (2): HR-ESIMS m/z = 338.0662 (C18H12NO6 [M-CO2-H]-, 338.0665 calculated); UV (CH3CN/H2O/trifluoroacetic acid) λmax, 228, 240, 257, 289, and 430 nm. WJ83Q3 (3): HR-ESIMS m/z = 319.0610 (C19H11O5 [M-H]-, 319.0607 calculated); UV (CH3CN/H2O/trifluoroacetic acid) λmax, 240, 267, 284, and 412 nm. WJ83Q1 (4): HR-ESIMS m/z = 296.0565 (C16H10NO5 [M-H]-, 296.0559 calculated); UV (CH3CN/H2O/trifluoroacetic acid) λmax: 228, 258, 290, and 430 nm; see supplemental Tables S2 and S3 for NMR spectral data. Isolation of WJ119 (6) from S. coelicolor CH999/pWJ119—Seventy R5 plates (2 liter) streaked with the CH999/pWJ119 were incubated at 30 °C for 8 days. The plates were extracted with 2 liter of EA/MeOH/acetic acid (94%/5%/1%). The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was first chromatographed on a normal-phase silica gel (100 g) column and eluted with EA in 1% acetic acid to give impure yellow fractions containing 6 (Rf value 0.38). Further purification of 6 was achieved on a preparative reverse-phase HPLC column (SunFire Prep C18 OBD column, 5 μm, 19 × 50 mm). A 5-95% CH3CN in water (10 mm triethylamine) gradient was used over 30 min with a flow rate of 3 ml/min to give yellow fractions containing 6 with a retention time of 12.4 min. The pH of the eluent was adjusted to ∼2 with 6 n HCl, extracted with EA, and dried in vacuo to give pure solid 6 (approximate yield of 58 mg/liter). WJ119 (6): HR-ESIMS m/z = 380.0780 (C20H14NO7 [M-H]-, 380.0770 calculated); UV (CH3CN/H2O/trifluoroacetic acid) λmax, 220, 268, 300, and 435 nm; see supplemental Table S1 for NMR spectral data. Enzyme Purification and in Vitro Assays—Gris ARO/CYC, OxyN, OxyI, and holo-OxyC were expressed and purified from E. coli strains BL21(DE3)/pWJ184, BL21(DE3)/pWJ181, BL21(DE3)/pWJ189, and BAP1/pWJ66, respectively (see supplemental data for details). ActIII ketoreductase and malonyl-CoA:ACP acyltransferase were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (34Korman T.P. Hill J.A. Vu T.N. Tsai S.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14529-14538Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35Summers R.G. Ali A. Shen B. Wessel W.A. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9389-9402Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). OxyAB was purified from CH999/pWJ131. The in vitro assays converting malonyl-CoA into aromatic polyketides were performed in reaction buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol). Each reaction mixture contained 2 mm malonyl-CoA, 300 nm malonyl-CoA:ACP acyltransferase, 20 μm holo-OxyC, and 10 μm OxyAB in a final volume of 100 μl. All other enzymes were added to final concentrations between 20 and 100 μm. NADPH (2 mm final concentration) was added as needed. Reactions were initiated by adding the substrate malonyl-CoA and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was extracted with EA/acetic acid (99%/1%), and the organic phase was dried in a SpeedVac and redissolved in 20 μl of Me2SO and analyzed with HPLC. We constructed a series of plasmids to identify the minimal set of enzymes required to afford the key intermediate 6-methylpretetramid. The genes of interest were systematically introduced into the E. coli/S. coelicolor shuttle vector as shown in Table 1. The plasmids were transformed into the engineered S. coelicolor host CH999 (32McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Science. 1993; 262: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and the production of polyketides by the host/vector pairs were assayed by LC/MS. Functional Study of OxyN—Our previous study had identified that OxyABCDJ were essential and sufficient to produce the amidated decaketide tetracycline backbone with good yield in CH999 (16Zhang W.J. Ames B.D. Tsai S.C. Tang Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, OxyK was identified by Petkovic et al. (28Petkovic H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32829-32834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed in our laboratory (36Hertweck C. Xiang L. Kalaitzis J.A. Cheng Q. Palzer M. Moore B.S. Chem.

OxyN showed strong sequence similarity to DpsY (37Lomovskaya N. Doi-Katayama Y. Filippini S. Nastro C. Fonstein L. Gallo M. Colombo A.L. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2379-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and MtmY (38Prado L. Lombo F. Brana A.F. Mendez C. Rohr J. Salas J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 261: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which catalyze cyclization of the second ring during daunorubicin and mithramycin biosynthesis, respectively. We tested the function of OxyN through coexpression with the oxy minimal PKS, OxyJ, OxyK, and OxyD in plasmid pWJ83. CH999/pWJ83 grown on R5 agar developed rust-colored, non-diffusible pigmentation in the mycelia. Several new biosynthetic products were detected from the CH999/pWJ83 extract and were partitioned with methanol and purified separately. The methanol-insoluble fractions contained the most abundant compound produced by this strain. WJ83T1 (1) was isolated at ∼55 mg/liter after reversed-phase HPLC purification. The UV spectrum of the compound in dilute acid showed absorption maxima at 278 nm and a broad peak at 500 nm that is indicative of an extended chromophore. The compound exhibited a bathochromic shift and developed a deep purple color with the addition of NaOH (λmax = 566 nm). HR-ESIMS indicated the molecular formula of C19H11NO7 for 1, consistent with the molecular composition of an amidated decaketide (Fig. 2). The 13C NMR spectrum (supplemental Table S1) showed 19 signals composed of 5 aromatic C-H residues and 14 quaternary carbons, suggesting a completely aromatized scaffold. Two downfield signals (δC-6 = 183.1 and δC-13 = 184.5 ppm) were indicative of conjugated carbonyls. The 1H NMR spectrum contained two broad signals corresponding to the free amide protons (δ = 7.87 and 9.67 ppm). Strong 1H,3C heteronuclear multiple-bond correlations of H-8/C-12, H-4/C-14, H-4/C-16, H-2/C-16, and H-2/C-18 together with the nuclear Overhauser effect coupling of H-2/H-4 established the polyhydroxyl naphthacenedione structure of 1. Accumulation of the linear, tetracyclic 1 as a major product in CH999/pWJ83 demonstrates that only two cyclases (OxyK and OxyN) were necessary to cyclize all four rings in tetracycline. Oxidation of ring C to a quinone was likely a spontaneous, nonenzymatic modification that is widely observed for aromatic polyketides (32McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S. Hopwood D.A. Khosla C. Science. 1993; 262: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 39Tang Y. Lee T.S. Khosla C. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 227-238Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40McDaniel R. Ebert-Khosla S.

Soc. 1998; 120: 7749-7759Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). LC-MS analysis indicated the likely presence of trace amount of the acetyl-primed version of 1 (m/z 364.1) in the extract of CH999/pWJ83. Numerous anthraquinone compounds were recovered from the methanol-soluble fraction of the CH999/pWJ83 extract. Reverse-phase HPLC purification yielded an orange-pigmented metabolite WJ83Q2 (2a) at ∼8 mg/liter (Fig. 2). WJ83Q2 has strong UV absorptions at 228, 257, and 430 nm and has a molecular formula of C19H14NO8. The 1H spectrum showed four aromatic proton signals, two methylene singlets and two broad 1H signals at δH = 7.12 and 7.52 ppm identified as amide protons. 2a is the amidated version of the well known metabolite aklanonic acid, which is an intermediate in the anthracycline biosynthetic pathways (Fig. 1) (42Eckardt K. Tresselt D. Schumann G. Ihn W. Wagner C. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1985; 38: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). NMR analysis in Me2SO-d6 also showed both the C-17/C-18 keto (2a) and enol (2b) isoforms were present with an equilibrium ratio of 2 to 3. Furthermore, after 2 days at room temperature in Me2SO-d6, 2a and 2b were completely decarboxylated to 2c and 2d as indicated by NMR and LC-MS analysis (supplemental Table S2). The acetyl-primed version of 2, desmethylaklanonic acid (5), was also purified from the methanol-soluble fraction (∼4.5 mg/liter). Two minor orange-pigmented metabolites, WJ83Q3 (3) and WJ83Q1 (4), were isolated from CH999/pWJ83 (Fig. 3). Compound 3 (2 mg/liter) had a molecular composition of C19H12O5, which indicated that it may be an acetyl-primed decaketide that has undergone loss of one CO2. NMR spectra (supplemental Table S3) confirmed regiospecific cyclization of D, C, and B rings and a unique O-15/C-19 cyclization to yield a fused γ-pyrone. The 4H-anthra[1,2-b]-pyran-4,7,12-trione aglycon is present"

We recently generated iPLA2β-null mice, and here we demonstrate that iPLA2β-null macrophages have reduced sensitivity to FCL-induced apoptosis, although they and wild-type (WT) cells exhibit similar increases in the transcriptional regulator CHOP. iPLA2β-null macrophages are also less sensitive to apoptosis induced by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin and the scavenger receptor A ligand fucoidan, and restoring iPLA2βexpression with recombinant adenovirus increases apoptosis toward WT levels. WT and iPLA2β-null macrophages incorporate [3H]arachidonic acid ([3H]AA]) into glycerophosphocholine lipids equally rapidly and exhibit identical zymosan-induced, cPLA2α-catalyzed [3H]AA release. In contrast, although WT macrophages exhibit robust [3H]AA release upon FCL, this is attenuated in iPLA2β-null macrophages and increases toward WT levels upon restoring iPLA2β expression. Recent reports indicate that iPLA2β modulates mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and we find that thapsigargin and fucoidan induce mitochondrial phospholipid loss and cytochrome c release into WT macrophage cytosol and that these events are blunted in iPLA2β-null cells. Immunoblotting studies indicate that iPLA2β associates with mitochondria in macrophages subjected to ER stress. AA incorporation into glycerophosphocholine lipids is unimpaired in iPLA2β-null macrophages upon electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analyses, and their complex lipid composition is similar to WT cells. These findings suggest that iPLA2β participates in ER stress-induced macrophage apoptosis caused by FCL or thapsigargin but that deletion of iPLA2β does not impair macrophage arachidonate incorporation or phospholipid composition.

Mammalian PLA2s include the PAF-acetylhydrolase PLA2 family, which exhibits substrate specificity for PAF and oxidized phospholipids, and the secretory PLA2 (sPLA2), which are low molecular weight enzymes that require millimolar concentrations of [Ca2+] for catalysis and affect inflammation and other processes (1Six D.A.

DNA laddering kits (Roche Diagnostics) were used to analyze internucleosomal cleavages characteristic of apoptosis as described (46Ramanadham S. Hsu F.F. Zhang S. Jin C. Bohrer A. Ma Z. Turk J.

Briefly, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer to prepare whole-cell lysates, which were resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and incubated (95 °C, 10 min). After SDS-PAGE analyses, samples were electrotransfered to 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membranes using a Bio-Rad mini-transfer tank and then incubated with primary antibodies. Protein bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were also probed with an anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody to assess loading. Preparation of Recombinant Adenovirus to Restore iPLA2β Expression to iPLA2β-Null Cells—An adenovirus that caused expression of iPLA2β was prepared with a ViraPower adenovirus expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cDNA that encodes the 84-kDa iPLA2β (13Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Kempe K. Chi X.S. Ladenson J. Turk J. J. Biol.

To examine specificity, PIAs were screened against a panel of 29 purified kinases. No kinase was inhibited, but one isoform of p38, p38α, was uniformly activated 2-fold. Molecular modeling of p38α revealed the presence of two regions that could interact with PIAs, one in the activation loop and a heretofore unappreciated region in the upper lobe that resembles a pleckstrin homology domain. In cells, two phases of activation were observed, an early phase that was independent of the upstream kinase MKK3/6 and inhibited by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and a latter phase that was coincident with MKK3/6 activation. In short term xenograft experiments that employed immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, PIA administration increased phosphorylation of p38 but not MKK3/6 in tumors in a statistically significant manner. Although PIAs rapidly activated p38 with similar time and dose dependence as Akt inhibition, p38 activation and Akt inhibition were independent events induced by PIAs. Using SB203580 or p38α-/- cells, we showed that p38α is not required for PIA-induced apoptosis but is required for H2O2- and anisomycin-induced apoptosis. Nonetheless, activation of p38a contributes to PIA-induced apoptosis, because reconstitution of p38a into p38α-/- cells increased apoptosis. These studies indicate that p38α is activated by PIAs through a novel mechanism and show that p38α activation contributes to PIA-induced cell death. Independent modulation of Akt and p38α could account for the profound cytotoxicity of PIAs.

Independent modulation of Akt and p38α could account for the profound cytotoxicity of PIAs. Akt (or protein kinase B) is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates key cellular processes, such as transcription, translation, proliferation, and survival, and is an emerging target in cancer (1Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). Developing methods to inhibit Akt has become a major effort within academic laboratories and the pharmaceutical industry. To date, most small molecule inhibitors of Akt have been identified through screening large compound libraries, which typically culminates in the isolation of compounds that target the ATP binding region of Akt (2Yang L. Dan H.C. Sun M. Liu Q. Sun X.M. Feldman R.I. Hamilton A.D. Polokoff M. Nicosia S.V. Herlyn M. Sebti S.M. Cheng J.Q. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4394-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Other efforts, including our own, have focused on lipid-based inhibitors that do not target the ATP binding domain (3Meuillet E.J. Mahadevan D. Vankayalapati H. Berggren M. Williams R. Coon A. Kozikowski A.P. Powis G. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 389-399PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kozikowski A.P. Sun H. Brognard J. Dennis P.A. J. Am. Chem.

We used molecular modeling to guide synthesis of phosphatidylinositol ether lipid analogues (PIAs) 3The abbreviations used are:PIAphosphatidylinositol ether lipid analoguePHpleckstrin homology domainPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseNSCLCnon-small cell lung cancerFBSfetal bovine serum that were designed to inhibit the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt. PIAs rapidly inhibited Akt and selectively induced apoptosis in cell lines with high levels of constitutively active Akt (6Castillo S.S. Brognard J. Petukhov P.A. Zhang C. Tsurutani J. Granville C.A. Li M. Jung M. West K.A. Gills J.G. Kozikowski A.P. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). PIAs are broadly cytotoxic in cancer cells, their activity correlates with the presence of active Akt, and they are effective in vivo in a hollow fiber assay (7Gills J.J. Holbeck S. Hollingshead M. Hewitt S.M. Kozikowski A.P. Dennis P.A. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several observations in previous studies suggested that PIAs might have other targets in addition to Akt. First, in comparison with other inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, such as LY294002 or rapamycin, PIAs equally inhibited Akt but induced more apoptosis than these compounds. Second, activation of members of the MAPK superfamily was observed with PIA administration (6Castillo S.S. Brognard J. Petukhov P.A. Zhang C. Tsurutani J. Granville C.A. Li M. Jung M. West K.A. Gills J.G. Kozikowski A.P. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Third, a COMPARE analysis of PIAs using the NCI60 molecular targets and cancer screening data base revealed that other molecular targets correlated more highly with responsiveness to PIAs than phospho-Akt (7Gills J.J. Holbeck S. Hollingshead M. Hewitt S.M. Kozikowski A.P. Dennis P.A. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The transition of PIAs (or any other approach targeting Akt) from preclinical compounds to useful therapeutics will depend in part upon identifying “off target” effects that could contribute to cellular responses. phosphatidylinositol ether lipid analogue pleckstrin homology domain phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase non-small cell lung cancer fetal bovine serum Ascertainment of specificity not only provides a deeper understanding of the biologic activities of a given compound but also has practical implications for further development. Identification of off target effects could expand possible clinical applications or provide greater understanding of drug-associated toxicities, which is perhaps best illustrated by the experience with imatinib mesylate. Although it was designed to inhibit the pathogenic fusion protein Bcr/Abl in chronic myelogenous leukemia and is approved for use in this disease, imatinib also inhibits PDGFR-b and c-Kit, which are highly relevant targets in other tumor types, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (8Capdeville R. Buchdunger E. Zimmermann J. Matter A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar, 9Heinrich M.C. Corless C.L. Demetri G.D. Blanke C.D. von Mehren M. Joensuu H. McGreevey L.S. Chen C.J. Van den Abbeele A.D. Druker B.J. Kiese B. Eisenberg B. Roberts P.J. Singer S. Fletcher C.D. Silberman S. Dimitrijevic S. Fletcher J.A. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 21: 4342-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). More recently, heart failure associated with use of imatinib in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients has been linked to inhibition of c-Abl in cardiac myocytes (10Kerkela R. Grazette L. Yacobi R. Iliescu C. Patten R. Beahm C. Walters B. Shevtsov S. Pesant S. Clubb F.J. Rosenzweig A. Salomon R.N. Van Etten R.A. Alroy J. Durand J.B. Force T. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), thereby linking inhibition of the same target, Abl, to clinical efficacy and toxicity. Therefore, the identification of other biologic activities of PIAs could possibly extend future clinical applications to tumors that exhibit activities other than Akt activation. Moreover, the identification of deleterious off target effects could facilitate choosing the best inhibitors of Akt that are most efficacious and least toxic. The MAPK superfamily is composed of kinases that can be organized into three pathways that are either stimulated by growth stimuli or cellular stress. Each pathway has a prototypic MAPK and MAPK kinase or MKK (11Raman M. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R886-R888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). One of the pathways stimulated by stress is composed of MKK3 and MKK6, which are two closely related protein kinases, and their MAPK substrate, p38 MAPK (12Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). p38 is an important member of the MAPK superfamily and is activated in response to various cell stresses, such as changes in osmolarity, DNA damage, heat shock, ionizing radiation, inflammatory cytokines, and ischemia (13Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3509) Google Scholar). Activation of the p38 pathway can induce a number of cellular responses, including alterations in transcription, the cell cycle, inflammation, and apoptosis. p38 exists as four isoforms (α, β, γ, and δ), all of which are normally activated by phosphorylation of the conserved Thr180-X-Tyr182 residues by the upstream kinases MKK3 or MKK6 (14New L. Han J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 results in phosphorylation of many downstream substrates, such as MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 and ATF2, and the p38 signal can be further propagated to proteins such as hsp27 (15Zarubin T. Han J. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 16Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). p38 activation has been observed in cancer cells following administration of different types of chemotherapy (17Olson J.M.

Dennis P.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 3502-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we screened PIAs against a panel of purified kinases and show that active PIAs activate a single isoform of p38, p38α, in vitro and in vivo. p38α activation is independent of Akt inhibition and occurs directly through mechanisms probably based on structural features of p38α as well as indirectly through mechanisms involving MKK3/6. Although activation of p38α is not required, it does contribute to PIA-induced apoptosis. Because p38α activation occurs in cancer cells after chemotherapy and in normal cells during inflammatory processes, activation of p38α by PIAs could contribute to the efficacy and/or toxicity of PIAs. The synthesis of the PIAs has previously been described (4Kozikowski A.P. Sun H. Brognard J. Dennis P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1144-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), phospho-Akt (Ser473), phospho-ATF-2 (Thr71), phospho-ASK1 (Thr845), phospho-Hsp27 (Ser82), phospho-MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (Thr334), phospho-MKK3/6 (Ser189/207), TAB1 and TAK1 antibodies, and the p38 kinase assay kit were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). α-Tubulin antibody was purchased from Sigma. SB203580 and LY294002 were from Calbiochem. Protease inhibitor mixture was obtained from Sigma, and protein assay materials were from Bio-Rad. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Protran pure nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell. The TAB1 antibody used for immunoprecipitations and the FLAG-tagged p38α plasmid have been previously described (21Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—NSCLC lines were established at the NCI/Navy Medical Oncology. The p38α-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts were a kind gift of Dr. Michael Karin, University of California (San Diego). All cell lines were maintained in a 75-cm2 flask in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 7.0% CO2 atmosphere. Molecular Modeling—The ligand binding site of the PH domain of Akt (Protein Data Bank code 1H10 (22Thomas C.C. Deak M.

The secondary structure of the proteins was rendered using Lithium 2.1 (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO). The putative binding sites were identified using the GRID algorithm available in the SiteID module in Sybyl 7.0. The GRID settings were set as default. The volumes of the grooves and cavities were estimated by Sybyl, and those smaller than 500 Å3 (roughly the volume of the sugar part of the PIA molecule and a phosphate group) were discarded. The docking of PIA23 was performed using the FlexX module in Sybyl 7.0 (Tripos Associates). The FlexX settings were set as default. The top conformations of PIA23 are shown in Fig. 1, B and C. For clarity, the long lipophilic chain of PIA23 was truncated. Screening Purified Kinases—Kinase assays were performed as previously described (24Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3944) Google Scholar, 25Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Pharmacological Treatments—NSCLC cells were plated 2–2.5 × 105 cells/well in 6- or 12-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and incubated for 24 h. The medium was then changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% FBS, and the cells were incubated overnight. Following overnight incubation, cells were treated with 10 μm PIAs dissolved in Me2SO for 2 h (immunoblotting/kinase assays), 18 h (immunoblotting experiments), or 24 h (apoptosis studies). In all experiments, Me2SO was added to control samples and had no effect on Akt activity. After incubation with PIAs, the cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis or for analysis of apoptosis as described below. For dose-response studies, NSCLC cells were plated at 2–2.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. After attachment, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% FBS overnight. Cells were treated with the indicated doses of PIAs for 2 h, and the cells were harvested for immunoblot analysis. Immunoblotting—Cell extracts were prepared by washing cells with phosphate-buffered saline and adding 2× LSB supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture as described previously (26Canman C.E. Wolff A.C. Chen C.Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Kastan M.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5054-5058PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were sonicated for 15 s with a Vibra Cell sonicator. The protein yield was quantified using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Equivalent protein was loaded, and the lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Equivalent loading was confirmed by staining membranes with fast green as previously described (27Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 587-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2930) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline, 5% milk, 0.1% Tween 20) and placed in primary antibody (1× Tris-buffered saline, 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 1:1000 antibody) overnight at 4 °C. Nitrocellulose membranes were washed three times in wash buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Tween 20, 1× Tris-buffered saline). Primary antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies and visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce Super Signal). Immunoblot experiments were performed at least three times. p38 Kinase Assays—p38 kinase assays were performed using a p38 assay kit following the manufacturer's recommendations (Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA)) with modifications described below. Cells were plated at a concentration of 2–4 × 105 and treated with PIAs as described above for 2 h. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm leupeptin) was added to the cells for 10 min. Lysates were cleared and allowed to immunoprecipitate for 2–3 h at 4 °C with anti-p38 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer. Kinase reaction was performed for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer supplemented with 200 mm ATP and 1 mg of ATF2 fusion protein. Reactions were terminated with 3× SDS buffer. The samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Kinase assays were repeated at least three times. Analysis of p38 and MKK3/6 in Vivo—PC3 prostate cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These were grown in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS. Male 6-week-old athymic nude mice (Athymic NCr-nu/nu) were inoculated subcutaneously (1 × 107 cells) in each rear flank. When tumors reached 200 mm3, the mice were randomized into 10 groups of three mice each. PIA23 was dissolved in a vehicle of 10% Me2SO in saline/Tween 80. The control group received intraperitoneal injections of the vehicle once a day, two times a day (every 12 h), three times a day (every 8 h), 4 times a day (every 6 h), or once a day for five consecutive days. The treatment groups received injections of 40 mg/kg PIA23 intraperitoneally on the same schedules. Four hours after the last dose, the mice were sacrificed, the tumors were removed, and half of each tumor was snap-frozen and half was fixed in 10% formalin. For immunoblotting, frozen tumors were thawed and homogenized in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein was quantified with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Densitometry was performed using NIH Image software. For immunohistochemistry, fixed tumors were paraffin-imbedded, sectioned, and placed on slides (Histoserv Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Antigen retrieval was performed in target retrieval solution (Dako-Cytomation California, Inc., Carpinteria, CA). Phospho-p38 antibody (catalog number 4631; Cell Signaling) was used at a dilution of (1:50), and phospho-MKK3/6 antibody (catalog number 9231; Cell Signaling) was used at a dilution of (1:100). Detection was performed by standard avidin-biotin complex methods. Immunoprecipitation—H157 cells were treated with PIA5 for 0 min, 15 min, or 1 h. To harvest, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate. Cells were allowed to incubate on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to clear the lysate. TAB1 was immunoprecipitated from 500 mg of protein using 2 μl of TAB1 antibody and protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Transient Transfections—1 × 106 p38α-/- cells were nucleofected with 2 μg of p38α plasmid or pc3DNA vector using nucleofector technology (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). Following nucleofection, 4 × 105 cells/well were plated in 6-well plates in RPMI plus 10% FBS. 72 h after nucleofection, the medium was removed and replaced with RPMI plus 0.1% FBS containing either Me2SO or 10 μm PIA5, followed by incubation and processing for Western blot or apoptosis assay. Apoptosis Assays—Cells were treated with PIAs for 18–24 h as described above. Floating cells were collected, and adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. Cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% methanol added dropwise and then incubated at -20 °C for 30 min. Cells were centrifuged and incubated with propidium iodide (25 μg/ml) supplemented with RNase A (30 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Quantification of sub-2 n DNA was determined by flow cytometry analysis using a BD Biosciences FACSort and by manual gating using CellQuest software. Apoptosis experiments were performed in triplicate and were repeated at least three times. PIAs Activate Purified p38α in Vitro—To examine the specificity of the PIAs, five active PIAs (PIA5, -6, -23, -24, and -25) and a negative control (PIA7, which is composed of only an ether lipid backbone and lacks the inositol head group) were screened against a panel of purified kinases (25Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Individual PIAs caused inhibition of select kinases (such as SGK and protein kinase A), but the inhibition of these kinases was not uniform and was not investigated further, because all active PIAs have similar cytotoxic properties in vitro (6Castillo S.S. Brognard J. Petukhov P.A. Zhang C. Tsurutani J. Granville C.A. Li M. Jung M. West K.A. Gills J.G. Kozikowski A.P. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast, the largest change in activity for all of the active PIAs was a 2-fold induction of activity in one isoform of p38 MAPK, p38α (SAPK2). An approximately 20% increase in p38β activity was also observed. Direct activation of p38α by phosphoinositides or analogues has not been described previously. Therefore, to examine whether there was a structural basis for activation of p38α by PIAs, molecular modeling was performed.TABLE 1High throughput kinase assay with purified kinases Kinase activity was assessed in the presence of five active PIAs (PIA5, -6, -23, -24, and -25) or an inactive PIA (PIA7) at 10 μm.

Sun H. Brognard J. Dennis P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1144-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of p38α revealed two regions that could possibly interact with PIAs (Fig. 1). Similarities were identified between the secondary and tertiary structures of the upper lobe of p38α and the PH domain of Akt. First, both proteins have a positively charged groove that is large enough to accommodate the PIAs. Second, the ligand binding site in Akt and the putative binding site in p38α are located between two pairs of antiparallel β-strands; the one pair is connected by a short β-hairpin loop, and the other is connected by a long β-hairpin loop (Fig. 1A). Specifically, two antiparallel β-strands β1 and β2 and the short loop β1/β2 (also known as VL1) in Akt match two antiparallel β-strands β1 and β2 and the short loop β1/β2 in p38α; the two β-strands β3 and β4 and the long loop β3/β4 (also known as VL2) in Akt match the β-strands β6 and β7 and the loop β6/β7 in p38α. In the case of Akt, the long hairpin loop β3/β4 is interrupted by a short α-helix. Third, the ligand binding site in Akt and the putative binding site in p38 contain amino acids (e.g. Arg, Asn, Tyr, and Lys) that are able to form strong electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions with ligands such as phosphatidylinositol and PIAs (Fig. 1B). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the upper lobe of p38α has a PH-like binding site/regulatory domain that might mediate interaction with PIAs. In addition to the putative PH-like domain, we identified another region of p38α in the activation loop near the ATP binding site at His174 that is predicted to interact with PIAs (Fig. 1, A and C, yellow circle). Because binding near amino acids, such as Arg10 in the PH-like domain and His174 in the activation loop is unlikely to occur simultaneously by one molecule of PIA due to the distance between these residues, these data suggest that the ability of PIAs to activate purified p38α is possibly related to interactions with two different regions of p38α. PIAs Increase p38 Phosphorylation and p38 Kinase Activity in Intact Cells—To determine whether PIAs cause p38 activation in cells, we performed immunoblotting using antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated or active form of p38. In H157 and PC3 cells, PIA5, -6, -23, -24, or -25 increased p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, upper panels). Similar results were also obtained with H1703 cells (data not shown). To confirm that the PIA-induced increase of p38 phosphorylation corresponded to an increase in kinase activity, we performed in vitro kinase assays and evaluated the phosphorylation status of targets downstream of p38 after PIA treatment. Treatment of H1703 cells with PIA5, -6, -23, -24, or -25 induced p38 kinase activity, as determined by increased phosphorylation of an exogenously added ATF2 peptide substrate (Fig. 2A, lower panels). Neither Me2SO nor PIA7 increased p38 activity in H1703 cells. These results show that PIAs increase p38 phosphorylation and kinase activity in intact cells. Mechanisms of p38 Activation by PIAs—Because the data from the purified kinase screen and molecular modeling suggested that PIAs could directly activate purified p38α in the absence of other kinases, we assessed the p38 pathway at early time points in H157 cells in the absence or presence of SB203580, an inhibitor of p38-mediated autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of downstream substrates (Fig. 2B, upper left panels). Within 10 min, PIA5 increased phosphorylation of p38 and hsp27 in the absence of MKK3/6 phosphorylation. Concurrent incubation with SB203580 completely inhibited PIA-in"
https://openalex.org/W2034320146,"CXCL12 is a CXC-type chemokine that plays important roles in hematopoiesis, development, and organization of the immune system and supports the survival or growth of a variety of normal or malignant cell types. Our laboratory recently showed that CXCL12 is secreted by aging stromal fibroblast cells and is a major paracrine factor that specifically stimulates the proliferation of prostate epithelial cells. The current study shows that this CXCL12-mediated proliferative response may be either ERK-dependent or ERK-independent. Moreover, CXCL12 initiates a previously undefined and complex global transcriptional response in prostate epithelial cells. This CXCL12-mediated transcriptional response directly stimulates the expression of genes encoding proteins that are involved in the promotion of cellular proliferation and progression through the cell cycle, tumor metastasis, and cellular motility, and directly represses the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion and resistance to apoptosis. Thus, CXCL12 may play a major role in the etiology of benign proliferative disease in the context of an aging tissue microenvironment.

Thus, CXCL12 may play a major role in the etiology of benign proliferative disease in the context of an aging tissue microenvironment. Many studies have shown that paracrine interactions help regulate the proliferation of both stromal and epithelial cells in the prostate and other endocrine organs (1Allinen M. Beroukhim R. Cai L.

However, previous studies have not been designed to examine how aging as a risk factor contributes to potential changes in stromal/epithelial paracrine interactions permissive for cellular proliferation. This is an important concern, because the coincident development of benign proliferative disease in the prostate with increasing patient age suggests that paracrine interactions may become dysfunctional and promote cellular proliferation as a consequence of the aging process. Moreover, the gradual increase in prostate volume with patient age that is characteristic of benign prostatic enlargement and benign prostatic hyperplasia suggests that mechanisms fostering low level, but cumulative, cellular proliferation are involved in the etiology of this disease. Recent studies from our laboratory utilizing an in vitro model system to examine the effects of the aging microenvironment on the development of benign proliferative disease in the human prostate demonstrated that paracrine interactions between human prostate epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts are disrupted in aging prostate tissues. Specifically, these studies showed that the CXC-type chemokine, CXCL12, is secreted by aging human prostate stromal fibroblasts at sub-nanomolar quantities that stimulate the proliferation of prostate epithelial cells (6Begley L. Monteleon C. Shah R.B. Macdonald J.W. Macoska J.A. Aging Cell. 2005; 4: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CXC-type chemokines have two conserved cysteines separated by one unconserved amino acid. There are several members of the CXC-type chemokine family with both conserved and diverse functions, although all CXC-type chemokines signal though membrane-bound G-protein-coupled receptors (7Koch A.E. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Many studies to date have focused on the role of CXCL12 in the acquisition and expression of an invasive, metastatic phenotype in human solid tumors, most notably, breast and prostate cancer (8Cabioglu N.

Taken together, these studies suggested that CXCL12 may play a role in acquisition of the proliferative phenotype in benign, and perhaps malignant, proliferative diseases of the prostate.

However, the definition and extent of the CXCL12-mediated transcriptional response, and the potential impact of this transcriptional response on expression of the proliferative phenotype, have not been elucidated. To address this issue, we have now evaluated the molecular signatures of prostate epithelial cells stimulated with sub-nanomolar levels of CXCL12 similar to those secreted by aging prostate stroma and known to stimulate cellular proliferation. These studies reveal that CXCL12-mediated signaling induces a robust transcriptional response in prostate epithelial cells that includes the up-regulation of genes encoding proteins that promote cellular proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, as well as the down-regulation of genes encoding proteins that normally act to promote apoptosis, cell-cell adhesion, and cell cycle arrest. This is the first report to show that CXCL12-mediated signaling induces a robust transcriptional response that may facilitate the acquisition of a proliferative and invasive phenotype by prostate epithelial cells. extracellular signal-regulated kinase epidermal growth factor MAPK/ERK kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase early growth response 1 Cell Cultures—N15C6 cells, developed as described previously, were used at passages 35–45 and were maintained in 5% HIE media (Ham's F-12 (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 5 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml EGF, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma) or in defined serum-free HIE media supplemented to 5 mm ethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mm HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 μg/μl transferrin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μm 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 μm sodium selenite (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% bovine serum albumin (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen), and 0.5 μg/ml fungizone (Cambrex Bioscience, Walkersville, MD). N15C6 cells are non-transformed prostate epithelial cells and grow continuously in culture but do not form colonies in soft agar or tumors in immunocompromised mice (20Macoska J.A. Paris P.

LNCaP cells, a widely used transformed prostate epithelial cell line originating from a prostate cancer lymph node metastasis, were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC# CRL-1740), were maintained in 10% RPMI media and 0.5 μg/ml fungizone, and were used at passages 25–35 (22Horoszewicz J.S.

Proliferation Assays—Cellular proliferation was assessed after plating cells at 50,000 cell/well in triplicate in 6-well plates and counting cells after 24 and 96 h of incubation as described previously (20Macoska J.A.

To assess the effects of exogenous CXCL12 on cellular proliferation, recombinant human SDF1 α/CXCL12 (R&D Systems, 350-NS) was added at the desired concentration in 1 ml of SF HIE (or 1 ml of SF HIE alone for control) to each well. The cells were re-fed at 48 and 72 h growth and counted at 24 and 96 h growth. Cell counts were normalized to 50,000 cells at 24 h to account for any plating discrepancies. Averages and standard deviations of cell number were calculated for each time point under each media condition. Experiments utilizing U0126 were performed as above, except that cells were pre-treated for 2 h with either 0.05% Me2SO (vehicle) or 0.05% Me2SO plus 5 μm U0126 before the addition of CXCL12. Cells were maintained in media containing U0126 and/or Me2SO for the duration of the experiment. For the antibody blockade experiments, 10,000 cells per well were plated in triplicate in 24-well dishes and preincubated with mouse anti-human CXCR4 (BD Pharmingen 555971) and rabbit anti-human CXCR7/RDC1 (Abcam ab12870-50) or mouse anti-human CXCR2 (BIOSOURCE AHR1532X) at 1 μg/ml for 1 h prior to CXCL12 addition. Cells were maintained in media containing appropriate antibodies for the entirety of the experiment, and cells were counted at 24 and 96 h as above. Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 Array Data Acquisition—RNA was purified from trypsinized cultured cells by homogenization in TRIzol (Invitrogen) and additional processing using the RNeasy (Qiagen) cleanup procedure. 10 μgof RNA was used to obtain labeled cRNA following the Affymetrix Standard protocol. Expression intensity values for each gene were estimated using a method called Robust Multiarray Average using tools available through Bioconductor. GeneChip gene expression values were normalized using a quantile normalization procedure. Quantitative Real-time PCR—All quantitative real-time assays were conducted as previously described with an Applied Biosystems 7900HT instrument and reagents (21Begley L. Keeney D. Beheshti B. Squire J.A. Kant R. Chaib H. Macdonald J.W. Rhim J. Macoska J.A. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006; 45: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 70% confluence in 60 mm dishes prior to RNA purification using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Experiments utilizing U0126 were performed as above, except that cells were treated with Me2SO (vehicle) or Me2SO plus 5 μm U0126 for 2 h, then grown in the presence or absence of CXCL12. For all experiments, 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed by use of Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was diluted 1:100. Real-time PCR was performed by use of Assays on Demand (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were performed in triplicate, including notemplate controls and an endogenous control probe, RPLPO (ribosomal protein, large, PO), to assess template concentration. Cycle numbers to threshold were calculated by subtracting averaged control from averaged experimental values, and fold gene expression was calculated by raising these values to the log 2. 6-Carboxy-fluorescine-conjugated, gene-specific assays were Hs00152928_m1 for EGR1, Hs00193306_m1 for EGFR, Hs00170433_m1 for ERBB2, and Hs99999902_m1 for the control, RPLPO. Western Blot and Protein Analysis—Cells were lysed, proteins were resolved by electrophoresis, and electroblotting was carried out as described previously (6Begley L. Monteleon C. Shah R.B.

Proteins were detected using antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling #9101), total ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, #9102), CXCR4 (Abcam #ab2074), CXCR7 (also known as RDC1, Abcam #ab12870), ELK-1 (Cell Signaling #9182), phospho ELK-1 (Cell Signaling #9181), and β-actin (#sc-1615, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), in conjunction with an ECL detection system. Secondary antibodies included goat anti-rabbit (Cell Signaling, #7074) and goat anti-mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #SC-2005), and both were used at a 1:5000 concentration. Immunoblots shown are representative of triplicate experiments. Densitometric quantitation of immunoblot films was accomplished by scanning the original films and converting the tiff files to grayscale images. Images were inverted, and mean band intensities were measured using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The mean intensity of adjacent background was also measured for each band and subtracted from band intensity. Statistical Analysis—Densitometric data from three experiments was averaged, and standard deviations were calculated for graphical depiction and statistical analysis. Normalized array-acquired transcript expression values were analyzed using a t-statistic test and by calculation of -fold change between data sets. Genes that exhibited both a large t-statistic (>10.0) and a large -fold change (>2.0) were considered to be differentially expressed. All other data were assessed by t test or analysis of variance with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. ERK Dependence of CXCL12-mediated Cellular Proliferation—Previous studies have shown that both transformed PC3 and LNCaP, as well as non-transformed N15C6 and BPH-1 prostate epithelial cells, express CXCR4, one of the receptors for CXCL12 (6Begley L. Monteleon C. Shah R.B. Macdonald J.W. Macoska J.A. Aging Cell. 2005; 4: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 19Wang J. Sun Y. Song W. Norb J.E. Wang C.Y. Taichman R.S. Cell.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4244-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We now show that these cells also robustly express CXCR7, a recently identified second receptor that recognizes CXCL12 (Fig. 1A) (25Burns J.M. Summers B.C. Wang Y. Melikian A. Berahovich R. Miao Z. Penfold M.E. Sunshine M.J. Littman D.R. Kuo C.J. Wei K. McMaster B.E. Wright K. Howard M.C. Schall T.J. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2201-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously shown that the stimulation of non-transformed N15C6 and transformed LNCaP cells with CXCL12 at sub-nanomolar levels similar to those secreted by aging prostate stromal fibroblasts induces these cells to proliferate (6Begley L. Monteleon C. Shah R.B. Macdonald J.W. Macoska J.A. Aging Cell. 2005; 4: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1B, N15C6 cells stimulated with 1 pm or 10 pm CXCL12 proliferate to levels significantly higher than those achieved by unstimulated cells (p < 0.001). This proliferation is maintained even after the cells are pre-treated with an antibody against an unrelated chemokine receptor, CXCR2 (Fig. 1B). However, pretreatment with antibodies against the CXCL12-specific receptor, CXCR4, or against both CXCR4 and CXCR7, significantly (p < 0.001) and equivalently ablated the ability of CXCL12 to stimulate proliferation. Thus, CXCL12-stimulated cellular proliferation is mediated through interactions with receptors that specifically recognize this chemokine. The Ras-mediated mitogen-activated kinase pathway is known to stimulate cellular proliferation. In this pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) phosphorylates ERK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates other molecules, including transcription factors, involved in cellular proliferation. Treatment of prostate epithelial cells with nanomolar levels of CXCL12 has been shown to activate the MEK/ERK pathway and promote cytokine secretion, angiogenesis, and transendothelial cellular migration (19Wang J.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9891-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has also shown that both sub-nanomolar and nanomolar levels of CXCL12 stimulate MEK/ERK pathway activation in prostate epithelial cells (Fig. 1, C–E, and Ref. 6Begley L. Monteleon C. Shah R.B. Macdonald J.W. Macoska J.A. Aging Cell. 2005; 4: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, LNCaP cells treated with CXCL12 at the sub-nanomolar levels that stimulate a proliferative response, e.g. 50 pm, demonstrate only a modest activation of ERK (Fig. 1C). In contrast, N15C6 cells treated with CXCL12 at the sub-nanomolar levels that stimulate a proliferative response, e.g. 1 pm or 10 pm, demonstrated rapid, transient ERK phosphorylation and activation (Fig. 1, D and E) (6Begley L. Monteleon C. Shah R.B. Macdonald J.W. Macoska J.A. Aging Cell. 2005; 4: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The observed differential extent of ERK activation in N15C6 and LNCaP cells treated with levels of CXCL12 known to stimulate proliferation in each cell line suggested that ERK activation might not be equivalently required for CXCL12-mediated proliferation in both cell lines. To test this, the MEK1 inhibitor, U0126, was utilized to inhibit the ability of MEK1 to phosphorylate ERK, thus preventing ERK activation. As seen in Fig. 1D, treatment of N15C6 cells with 1 pm, 10 pm, or 1000 pm CXCL12 resulted in rapid and transient MEK1-mediated ERK phosphorylation. However, cotreatment of the cells with CXCL12 and 1.0 μm or 5.0 μm U0126 greatly diminished ERK phosphorylation. Densitometric analysis of the immunoblot confirmed these observations and showed that cells pre-treated with either concentration of inhibitor failed to phosphorylate ERK in response to treatment with CXCL12 (Fig. 1E). Moreover, the proliferative response of N15C6 cells to CXCL12 was nearly ablated when the cells were co-treated with CXCL12 and 5.0 μm U0126 in 0.05% Me2SO compared with co-treatment with CXCL12 without inhibitor in 0.05% Me2SO (Fig. 1F). In contrast, the proliferative response of LNCaP cells to CXCL12 was not affected by co-treatment with U0126 (Fig. 1F). CXCL12-mediated Signaling Activates ELK1 and Promotes EGR1 Gene Transcription—Both N15C6 and LNCaP cells were next examined for CXCL12-mediated activation of ELK-1, an Ets domain-type transcription factor that is itself activated through phosphorylation by both MAPK-dependent and -independent mechanisms (27Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Mohney R.P. Das M. Bivona T.G. Hanes R. Adams A.G. Philips M.R. O'Bryan J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47038-47045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). N15C6 and LNCaP prostate epithelial cells stimulated with CXCL12 demonstrated rapid and transient phosphorylation of ELK-1 as visualized by immunoblotting and quantitated by densitometry (Fig. 2). ELK-1 is a transcriptional activator of the early growth response 1 (EGR1) gene, which encodes a C2H2-type zinc-finger protein that is induced by mitogenic stimulation and has been shown to stimulate tumor cell growth, play a role in tumor progression, and stimulate angiogenesis and improved survival of tumor cells (29Adamson E.D. Mercola D. Tumour Biol. 2002; 23: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays showed that both N15C6 and LNCaP cells, stimulated with low, picomolar levels of CXCL12 similar to those observed to promote N15C6 and LNCaP cellular proliferation, rapidly and robustly accumulate EGR1 gene transcript (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3CXCL12 mediates a robust transcriptional response. A, quantitative real-time PCR of RNA purified from N15C6 cells pre-treated with 0.05% Me2SO then treated with 10 pm CXCL12 (black triangles) or LNCaP cells pre-treated with 0.05%Me2SO then treated with 50 pm CXCL12(blacksquares)demonstratesrapid and robust transcription of the EGR1 gene (*, p < 0.001). This response is significantly dampened when the cells are first pretreated for 2 h with 5 μm U0126 in 0.05% Me2SO (white triangles, N15C6 cells; white squares, LNCaP cells) (#, p < 0.001). B, quantitative real-time PCR of RNA purified from N15C6 cells treated for 30 min with 10 pm CXCL12 or LNCaP cells treated with 50 pm CXCL12 (black bars) demonstrates a robust and significant accumulation of transcript from the EGFR gene (*, p < 0.001) and a significant decrease in transcription of the ERBB2 gene (#, p < 0.05) compared with treated cells at 0 min (gray bars), parallel to RNA profiling results obtained using Affymetrix GeneChips. C, principal components analysis of the CXCL12-stimulated transcriptional response is shown for N15C6 and LNCaP cells in SF HIE media after a 2-h pre-treatment with 0.05% Me2SO (white dots and dotted ovals), the same but pre-treated with 0.05% Me2SO and stimulated with 10 pm (N15C6) or 50 pm (LNCaP) CXCL12 (black dots and black ovals), or pre-treated with 0.05% Me2SO plus 5μm U0126 and stimulated with 10 pm (N15C6) or 50 pm (LNCaP) CXCL12 (gray dots and gray ovals). Each experiment was performed twice, and both sets of data are shown. The significant separation along both components (PC1 and PC2) between the transcriptional responses resulting from Me2SO and Me2SO plus CXCL12 treatments demonstrates that CXCL12 induces a robust transcriptional response in both cell lines. The separation between the transcriptional responses resulting from Me2SO plus CXCL12 and Me2SO plus CXCL12 plus U0126 treatments is greater for N15C6 than for LNCaP cells, suggesting that the CXCL12-mediated transcriptional response is more ERK-dependent for N15C6 than LNCaP cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ERK Dependence of CXCL12-mediated EGR1 Gene Transcription—The specificity of the EGR1 gene transcriptional response to CXCL12-mediated ERK signaling was next examined using the MEK1 inhibitor, U0126. For these experiments, cells plated in triplicate at 50,000 cells/well were pre-treated with 0.05% Me2SO or 0.05% Me2SO and 5 μm U0126 (Cell Signaling) for 2 h, then stimulated with CXCL12 at concentrations shown previously to induce EGR1 gene transcription, e.g. 10 pm CXCL12 for N15C6 cells and 50 pm CXCL12 for LNCaP cells. As seen in Fig. 3A, pre-treatment with the MEK1 inhibitor inhibited the EGR1 gene transcriptional response in both cell lines but more profoundly in N15C6 than LNCaP cells. These results suggest that CXCL12-mediated EGR1 gene transcription is more ERK-dependent in N15C6 than LNCaP cells. CXCL12 Stimulates a Global Transcriptional Response in Prostate Epithelial Cells That Is Partially ERK-dependent—We had previously reported that both non-transformed N15C6 and transformed LNCaP prostate epithelial cells respond proliferatively to low, picomolar levels of CXCL12, similar to those secreted by aging human prostate stromal fibroblasts (6Begley L. Monteleon C. Shah R.B. Macdonald J.W. Macoska J.A. Aging Cell. 2005; 4: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The observation that these same levels of CXCL12 stimulated ELK1 activation and EGR1 gene transcription raised the possibility that other genes may also be transcribed in response to CXCL12 stimulation. To explore this possibility, N15C6 and LNCaP cells were treated in replicate with CXCL12 and the MEK1 inhibitor, U0126, in 0.05% Me2SO; CXCL12 and 0.05% Me2SO; or 0.05% Me2SO alone, for 30 min. The cells were immediately lysed, and the purified RNA was subjected to gene expression profiling using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. The results of these experiments showed that N15C6 cells demonstrated up-regulation of 370 genes and down-regulation of 162 genes at significance levels of p < 0.05 and -fold levels >1.5 consequent to stimulation with 10 pm CXCL12. LNCaP cells demonstrated up-regulation of 185 genes and down-regulation of 413 genes consequent to stimulation with 50 pm CXCL12 (Table 1). Thus, the transcriptional response of N15C6 cells to CXCL12 stimulation was largely positive and resulted in the up-regulation of the majority (370/532, or 70%) of genes differentially transcribed. In contrast, the transcriptional response of LNCaP cells to CXCL12 stimulation was largely negative and resulted in the transcriptional repression of the majority (413/598, or 69%) of genes differentially transcribed.TABLE 1Summary of CXCL12-regulated transcriptional response in N15C6 and LNCaP cellsUp-regulatedDown-regulatedN15C6 response to CXCL12370162N15C6 response to CXCL12 plus U012629296LNCaP response to CXCL12185413LNCaP response to CXCL12 plus U01261326 Open table in a new tab Although the gene transcription profiles induced by CXCL12 were largely different between N15C6 and LNCaP cells, 85 genes were transcribed in common (Table 2). The use of both the Gene Ontology and Information Hyperlinked over Proteins data bases permitted a limited functional assessment of proteins encoded by genes commonly transcriptionally down- or up-regulated consequent to CXCL12 stimulation (30Hoffmann R. Valencia A. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 664Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). This assessment showed that the predicted functional consequences of loss of expression for many of the proteins encoded by the 52 commonly down-regulated genes and 33 up-regulated genes was consistent with promoting cellular proliferation or tumor progression. Quantitative real-time PCR of RNA purified from N15C6 or LNCaP cells treated for 30 min with CXCL12 demonstrates a robust and significant accumulation of transcript from the EGFR gene and a significant decrease in transcription of the ERBB2 gene compared with treated cells at 0 min, parallel to RNA profiling results obtained using Affymetrix GeneChips (Fig. 3B and Table 2).TABLE 2Genes commonly transcriptionally regulated by CXCL12 in N15C6 and LNCaP cellsDown-regulated genesPromoting effect on cellular proliferation/tumor metastasisDown-regulated genesPromoting effect on cellular proliferation/tumor metastasisUp-regulated genesPromoting effect on cellular proliferation/tumor metastasisCDH1Impairs cell-cell adhesionTP53Promotes progression through cell cycleEGFRPotentially up-regulates cell proliferationCTNNB1Impairs cell-cell adhesionMAFKPromotes progression through cell cycleCD44Promotes resistance to apoptosis; metastasis repressor in prostate cancerCPSF1Impairs cell-cell adhesionCUGBP1Promotes progression through cell cycleANKRD12Amplified in some retinoblastomasEXOSC6Impairs cell-cell ad"
https://openalex.org/W2095051052,"Collagen XXIII belongs to the class of type II orientated transmembrane collagens. A common feature of these proteins is the presence of two forms of the molecule: a membrane-bound form and a shed form. Here we demonstrate that, in mouse lung, collagen XXIII is found predominantly as the full-length form, whereas in brain, it is present mostly as the shed form, suggesting that shedding is tissue-specific and tissue-regulated. To analyze the shedding process of collagen XXIII, a cell culture model was established. Mutations introduced into two putative proprotein convertase cleavage sites showed that altering the second cleavage site inactivated much of the shedding. This supports the idea that furin, a major physiological protease, is predominantly responsible for shedding. Furthermore, our studies indicate that collagen XXIII is localized in lipid rafts in the plasma membrane and that ectodomain shedding is altered by a cholesterol-dependent mechanism. Moreover, newly synthesized collagen XXIII either is cleaved inside the Golgi/trans-Golgi network or reaches the cell surface, where it becomes protected from processing by being localized in lipid rafts. These mechanisms allow the cell to regulate the amounts of cell surface-bound and secreted collagen XXIII. Collagen XXIII belongs to the class of type II orientated transmembrane collagens.

These mechanisms allow the cell to regulate the amounts of cell surface-bound and secreted collagen XXIII. The group of collagenous transmembrane proteins consists of type XIII, XVII, XXIII, and XXV collagens and several related proteins such as ectodysplasin A, the class A macrophage scavenger receptors, the MARCO1 receptor, and the group of colmedins. These are type II transmembrane proteins that contain at least one collagenous triple helical domain (summarized in Ref. 1Franzke C.-W. Bruckner P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4005-4008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Collagens XIII, XXIII, and XXV are of unknown function and consist of three collagenous domains that are flanked and separated by non-collagenous domains. Whereas collagen XVII is more distantly related, types XIII, XVII, XXIII, and XXV all exist in two forms: a transmembrane form and a shed ectodomain form. Whereas collagen XVII is shed from the surface by TACE (tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme), a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family (2Franzke C.-W. Tasanen K. Schacke H. Zhou Z. Tryggvason K. Mauch C. Zigrino P. Sunnarborg S. Lee D.C. Fahrenholz F. Bruckner-Tuderman L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), mutation analysis of collagens XIII and XXV demonstrated that the protease furin produces the shed forms (3Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 4Vaisanen M.R. Vaisanen T. Pihlajaniemi T. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 685-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial cell culture studies suggested an involvement of furin either directly or indirectly in the cleavage of collagen XXIII as well (5Banyard J. Bao L. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20989-20994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the co-existence in tissues of both the transmembrane and shed forms of collagen XXIII was suggested from immunoblot analyses (6Koch M. Veit G. Stricker S. Bhatt P. Kutsch S. Zhou P. Reinders E. Hahn R.A. Song R. Burgeson R.E. Gerecke D.R. Mundlos S. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21546-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).The shedding of an ectodomain amplifies the possible functional role of a protein because different forms, i.e. full-length cell surface-bound or soluble, likely have different biological activity. The “sheddase” furin is a member of a proprotein convertase family. Among other functions, furin participates in the maturation and activation of proteins at the cell surface, endowing the cell with the ability to change its functional behavior (7Mayer G. Boileau G. Bendayan M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G.

Moreover, conversion by proteolytic cleavage can be tightly regulated (10Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 11Werb Z. Yan Y. Science. 1998; 282: 1279-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furin-dependent shedding has been implicated in the activation of growth factors, initiating protease cascades as well as affecting pathogen entry into cells. With regard to the latter, it is notable that the virulence of pathogens such as anthrax, Ebola virus, and influenza virus is influenced by the presence of furin cleavage sites in viral proteins (9Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is at least one instance demonstrating that pathology results if shedding does not occur. A mutation in the furin cleavage site of the transmembrane collagen-like molecule ectodysplasin A is responsible for 20% of the cases of X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (12Chen Y. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Gambee J. Bachinger H.P. Ferguson B. Zonana J. Thomas G. Morris N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7218-7223Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence for furin cleavage is Arg-X-(Lys/Arg)-Arg (13Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), with the most critical position being Arg at position 1. Less conserved sequences such as Arg-X-X-Arg also serve as furin cleavage sites, but with 10-fold lower efficiency than the consensus sequence. Furin is activated by two autocatalytic cleavage processes in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 2The abbreviations used are:TGNtrans-Golgi networkAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloridecmkchloromethyl ketoneMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinRTreverse transcriptionHEKhuman embryonic kidneyEBNAEpstein-Barr virus nuclear antigenDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPLAPphosphatidylinositol-linked placental alkaline phosphataseHTrRhuman transferrin receptorPBSphosphate-buffered salinePCproprotein convertaseα1-PDXα1-antitrypsin Portland 2The abbreviations used are:TGNtrans-Golgi networkAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloridecmkchloromethyl ketoneMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinRTreverse transcriptionHEKhuman embryonic kidneyEBNAEpstein-Barr virus nuclear antigenDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPLAPphosphatidylinositol-linked placental alkaline phosphataseHTrRhuman transferrin receptorPBSphosphate-buffered salinePCproprotein convertaseα1-PDXα1-antitrypsin Portland (14Anderson E.D.

As a mature enzyme, furin cycles between the cell surface and the TGN in a well regulated clathrin-dependent fashion (8Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar).To regulate which form of a transmembrane molecule is present in a cell's environment, control is exerted not only by activation of the sheddase, but also by accessibility of the sheddase enzyme to the cell-surface protein to be shed. In this context, the plasma membrane microenvironment has a crucial regulatory function for the shedding of a variety of transmembrane proteins such as Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (15Ehehalt R. Keller P. Haass C. Thiele C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), CD30 (16von Tresckow B. Kallen K.J. von Strandmann E.P. Borchmann P. Lange H.

Lipid rafts are small, dispersed, cholesterol-rich, and sphingolipid-rich microdomains that are fluid, but tightly packed (19Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8017) Google Scholar). The lipid raft and non-raft microdomains have different association capabilities and therefore accumulate and separate membrane proteins. Lipid rafts play an important role in signal transduction, cell-cell interaction, and endocytosis of certain proteins (20Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5109) Google Scholar, 21Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

We also show that ectodomain shedding is influenced by the plasma membrane microenvironment: lowering the cellular cholesterol level significantly increases the shedding of collagen XXIII. This, together with partial shedding already occurring in the secretory pathway, likely represents the mechanism used by cells to regulate the ratio of the membrane-bound to released ectodomain forms of collagen XXIII. In addition, shedding is also tissue-dependent: in brain, collagen XXIII is present predominantly as the shed form, and in other tissues such as skin and lung, the full-length molecule is the prevailing form.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—The following protease inhibitors were used: AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; Merck); antipain, 1,10-ortho-phenanthroline, aprotinin, E-64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane), pepstatin A, leupeptin, and chymostatin (Sigma); the furin inhibitor decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (cmk; Bachem); the hydroxamate inhibitor TAPI-0 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem GmbH); and the membrane-impermeable furin inhibitor α1-PDX (Calbiochem). Other chemicals used were methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) and filipin III from Streptomyces filipiensis (Sigma), brefeldin A (Epicentre Biotechnologies), and 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (Pierce).Cloning of Full-length α1(XXIII) and Furin cDNAs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used to clone the full-length mouse α1(XXIII) and furin cDNAs. Primers were designed according to the mRNA sequences provided for GenBank™ accession numbers NM153393 (α1(XXIII)) and NM011046 (furin). The full-length α1(XXIII) cDNA was amplified from mouse embryonic day 15.5 cDNA using the primer pair K500/K501 (see the list of PCR primers in supplemental Table S1). The full-length construct was ligated into a modified pCEP-Pu vector carrying a 3′-His8 tag. The full-length furin cDNA was amplified from mouse embryonic day 15.5 reverse-transcribed mRNA using the primer pair P185/P186. Additional furin cDNA was ligated into a modified pCEP-Pu vector carrying a 5′-SPARC/BM40 signal peptide and a 3′-FLAG tag. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amino acids of the two potential furin cleavage sites within non-collagenous domain 1 of collagen XXIII were altered. The primer pair M515/M517 was used to introduce the mutation R86Q (termed A), and the primer pairs M506/M507 and M508/M509 were used to insert the mutations R96S (B1) and R99G (B2), respectively.Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from various tissues and primary cells of newborn and adult C57BL/6J mice using the RNeasy fibrous tissue midi kit (Qiagen Inc.). Aliquots (2 μg) were transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers and the enzymes SuperScript™ II and III (Invitrogen). The relative RT-PCRs were performed in the linear range of amplification. The mouse α1(XXIII) primers M630 and K501 produced a 727-bp product, and the control primers for γ-actin (M542 and M543) produced a 569-bp product. Products were run on agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. On-line quantification of the bands was performed using a Diana III advanced imaging system (Raytest).Real-time RT-PCR—Primers and probes were designed using open source Primer3 web software (frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi) and were evaluated by Blast searches at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/). All primers and probes were synthesized by Metabion. For detection and quantification of the PCR assays, the Mx3000P real-time PCR system (Stratagene) was employed. For relative quantification, 18 S rRNA served as an internal control. All primer/probe combinations were designed intron-spanning. The primer/probe combinations RT1-RT2/RTprobe1 for collagen XXIII and RT3-RT4/RTprobe2 for 18 S RNA were used (see the list of PCR primers in supplemental Table S1). The real-time PCR amplification was performed in a final reaction volume of 20 μl containing primers (300 nm) and probe (200 nm) mixed with the appropriate volume of Eppendorf RealMasterMix (Eppendorf AG) and 4 μl of cDNA. The reaction mixture was preheated at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s and 60 °C for 1 min. All experiments were evaluated by performing three identical runs. To avoid quantification bias, a standard curve of every assay on every single run was carried out to ascertain the specific amplification efficiency. Briefly, the relative mRNA expression level was determined setting the cycle threshold against the standard curve in each case. Normalization against the internal control 18 S RNA was followed by calculating the case-specific calibrated gene expression. The mean value of normalized gene expression of skin mRNA served as a calibrator.Isolation and Cultivation of Cells and Cell Culture-based Assays—Keratinocytes were isolated from newborn mouse skin and placed in primary culture according to established procedures (22Zhang Z.G.

They were either kept under low calcium conditions to sustain their proliferative potential or treated for 2 h with 2 mm CaCl2-containing medium to induce the formation of cell-cell contacts. Full-length collagen XXIII cDNA (ligated into the pCEP-Pu vector) was used to transfect human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 (HEK 293-EBNA cells; Invitrogen) and HT1080 cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The medium used was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/nutrient mixture F-12 with GlutaMAX™ (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom AG). Supplements of 250 μml-ascorbic acid and 450 μml-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma) were added every day. Stable transfectants were selected with puromycin (1.25 μg/ml; Sigma). For shedding assays, the stably transfected cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 250 μm ascorbate, followed by incubation with the indicated chemicals for specified periods. The media and cell lysates were prepared and processed as described below.Protein Isolation from Cells and Tissue and Western Blot Analysis—Protein isolation from tissue and subsequent immunoprecipitation and detection of collagen XXIII by Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (6Koch M.

The medium was collected on ice; protease inhibitors (1 mm AEBSF and 10 mm EDTA) were added immediately; and cell debris were removed by centrifugation. To the remaining cell layer was added chilled extraction buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and Complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and the sample was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The material was then collected using cell scrapers, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was precipitated with acetone or methanol/chloroform, and normalized aliquots were run on gels for immunoblotting with the previously described guinea pig anti-collagen XXIII antibody (6Koch M.

Normalization was accomplished 1) by working with same cell numbers, 2) by determination of the protein content of the cell lysates and application of specified protein amounts and comparable volumes of cell supernatant for analysis, and 3) by analyzing the Western blot signals of cell supernatants with respect to the signals of the corresponding cell lysates. For quantitation, densitometry of signals was done using the Gel-Pro Express program (Media Cybernetics) or by performing on-line signal quantification with a Diana III advanced imaging system.Immunofluorescence Staining and Antibody-induced Patching—Antibody-induced patching was performed as described previously (18Zimina E.P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Franzke C.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34019-34024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293-EBNA cells cultured on coverslips were cotransfected with full-length α1(XXIII) or furin cDNA and phosphatidylinositol-linked placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) or human transferrin receptor (HTrR) cDNA, respectively. First, the clustering of proteins was induced by incubation of the cells with the respective combination of anti-HTrR (DakoCytomation) or anti-PLAP (Biomeda) monoclonal antibodies with either the guinea pig polyclonal antibodies against the ectodomain of collagen XXIII or the anti-furin polyclonal antibody (Alexis Biochemicals) for 60 min at 12 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit (Dako-Cytomation) secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at 12 °C. Subsequently, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and mounted in PBS (pH 7.0) containing 37% glycerol, 12.5% Mowiol (Calbiochem), and 0.65% N-propyl gallate (Sigma) as an anti-fade agent. Fluorescent images were taken on an Axiophot microscope equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MRc digital camera. Quantitative analysis was performed by substracting background fluorescence and transforming the fluorescence signals to binary values. Each individual membrane patch was classified into the categories co-localization, partial co-localization, and segregation. Typically 100-250 membrane patches were present per cell, and a total number of eight cells were evaluated for each collagen XXIII-marker protein double labeling. For each furin-marker protein double labeling, four cells were quantified. For immunofluorescence staining, cells cultured on Nunc glass chamber slides were either incubated with serum-free medium containing guinea pig anti-collagen XXIII antibody for 1 h, followed by fixation with ice-cold methanol for 2 min, or directly fixed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by incubation with guinea pig anti-collagen XXIII antibody and anti-GM130 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). After washing with PBS, Cy™3-conjugated anti-guinea pig (Dako-Cytomation) and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) antibodies were applied, and the stained slides were analyzed with a Leica TCS SL confocal laser scanning microscope.Cross-linking Experiments—HEK 293-EBNA cells were cotransfected with full-length α1(XXIII) cDNA and PLAP or HTrR cDNA. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 0.25 mm 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) for 30 min at room temperature. Alternatively, cells were treated with 10 mm MβCD prior to cross-linking. The reaction was stopped with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The cells were lysed (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem)) and immunoprecipitated with guinea pig anti-collagen XXIII polyclonal antibodies. The precipitated proteins were eluted from antibody-coupled beads, and the cross-linker was reduced by heating for 10 min at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. Subsequently, the eluates were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with guinea pig anti-collagen XXIII polyclonal, anti-PLAP monoclonal (Sigma), and anti-HTrR monoclonal antibodies.Cell-surface Biotinylation—Cell-surface biotinylation was carried out as described by Franzke et al. (2Franzke C.-W. Tasanen K. Schacke H. Zhou Z. Tryggvason K. Mauch C. Zigrino P. Sunnarborg S. Lee D.C. Fahrenholz F. Bruckner-Tuderman L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell-surface proteins were biotinylated with 6.6 mm biotin-X-NHS (Calbiochem) for 5 min at room temperature. After washing five times with PBS, the cells were cultured in fresh medium supplemented with ascorbate. At the desired time points, the media were collected, and cell lysates were prepared as described above. Biotinylated proteins from both the medium and the cell layer extract were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose (Novagen) and immunoblotted for reaction with guinea pig anti-collagen XXIII antibody to detect biotinylated collagen XXIII.Quantification of Cellular Cholesterol and Protein Content of Cell Lysates—To normalize cell lysates for Western blot analysis, the protein content was determined with a binicotinic acid assay kit (Uptima). Cellular cholesterol content was assayed spectrophotometrically using a cholesterol quantitation kit (BioVision, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSShedding of Collagen XXIII Is Tissue-dependent—We demonstrated previously the tissue distribution of collagen XXIII in mouse skin, kidney, lung, and brain (6Koch M. Veit G. Stricker S. Bhatt P. Kutsch S. Zhou P. Reinders E. Hahn R.A. Song R. Burgeson R.E. Gerecke D.R. Mundlos S. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21546-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Preliminary indications from immunoblots suggested that the protein is shed in some tissue and full-length in others. Using brain and lung as examples, immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitated collagen XXIII revealed that the largest (full-length) form of collagen XXIII is predominant in lung, whereas in brain, three additional signals at lower mass were detected (Fig. 1A). The largest of these ran at the same molecular mass as the ectodomain from the conditioned medium of HT1080 cells stably transfected with full-length α1(XXIII) cDNA (see supernatant lane in Fig. 1A). The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by the products being specifically digested with highly purified bacterial collagenase. These data suggest that, if ectodomain shedding occurs, it is extensive in brain tissue, but minor in lung. Curiously, the two lower molecular mass immunoproducts from brain were not present in the lysates or medium of cells expressing recombinant collagen XXIII. This likely represents either a further degree of tissue-related processing that does not occur in recombinant HEK 293-EBNA and HT1080 cell cultures or cleavage by an enzyme present in brain, but not in the cell lines. To test this, we attempted to isolate this lowest molecular mass form to perform microsequence analysis, but enough could not be obtained. Therefore, we validated it as a processed form of collagen XXIII by excluding the possibility that it arose from a splice variant of the mRNA: RT-PCR amplification of full-length collagen XXIII cDNA was performed with total RNA isolated from different tissues. The amplified product from brain, lung, skin, and total embryonic RNA was the same size (data not shown). The results are consistent with the lower molecular mass bands being processed forms of collagen XXIII.To study the shedding process in a cell culture system, a collagen XXIII-containing tissue (i.e. skin) (6Koch M. Veit G. Stricker S. Bhatt P. Kutsch S. Zhou P. Reinders E. Hahn R.A. Song R. Burgeson R.E. Gerecke D.R. Mundlos S. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21546-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with cells that could be easily separated and cultured was utilized for the next set of studies. To our surprise, semiquantitative PCR showed that primary keratinocytes cultured from mouse skin and stimulated for various periods with calcium contained sharply reduced amounts of α1(XXIII) mRNA, and cultured dermal fibroblasts gave an mRNA signal that was barely detectable compared with mRNA levels from tissues (Fig. 1B). The drastic down-regulation of α1(XXIII) mRNA expression in cultured keratinocytes compared with skin was confirmed by real-time PCR (Fig. 1C). For comparison, real-time PCR was performed with RNA from muscle, a tissue containing only minimal amounts of collagen XXIII mRNA and protein (6Koch M. Veit G. Stricker S. Bhatt P. Kutsch S. Zhou P. Reinders E. Hahn R.A. Song R. Burgeson R.E. Gerecke D.R. Mundlos S. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21546-21557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, to manipulate collagen XXIII in an in vitro culture system, we employed immortalized cell lines (HEK 293-EBNA and HT1080) that we stably transfected with full-length α1(XXIII) cDNA.Subcellular localization of collagen XXIII in the transfected cell lines was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining in comparison with the low expression levels in primary mouse keratinocytes. In keratinocytes cultivated under low calcium conditions and kept at a low passage number, weak signals for collagen XXIII that co-localized with the Golgi marker protein GM130 could be detected (Fig. 2A). Similarly, co-localization was found in the transfected cell lines (Fig. 2, B and C). Also, cell-surface localization of collagen XXIII was detected in non-permeabilized primary keratinocytes that were stimulated with calcium to form cell-cell contacts and in non-permeabilized transfected cells, emphasizing detection of the molecule at the cell-cell boundaries (Fig. 2, D and E). Therefore, because the expression pattern of collagen XXIII in transfected cultures is similar to that in keratinocytes, we used transfected cell cultures to study shedding.FIGURE 2Subcellular localization of collagen XXIII in primary mouse keratinocytes and cell lines transfected withα1(XXIII). Primary mouse keratinocytes (A and D),α1(XXIII)-transfected HT1080 cells (B and E), and α1(XXIII)-transfected HEK 293-EBNA cells (C and F) were stained with anti-collagen (col) XXIII polyclonal antibody (red) after (A-C) or prior (D-F) to fixation and solubilization of the cells. Counterstaining (A-C) was performed with antibody against the Golgi marker protein GM130 (green). Merging the images indicated intracellular co-localization (yellow) of collagen XXIII with the Golgi marker (A-C). Staining for collagen XXIII in non-permeabilized cells (D-F) identified its localization at the plasma membrane as well as its concentration at cell-cell boundaries.

https://openalex.org/W2098733390,"We recently showed that extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which are abundant in desmoplastic pancreatic tumor, are as potent as growth factors in inhibiting apoptosis in pancreatic cancer (PaCa) cells. Here we show that fibronectin, a major ECM component, engages insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) to inhibit PaCa cell death. We found that fibronectin-induced protection from apoptosis is fully mediated by IGF-IR and is independent of IGF-I. Pharmacologic and molecular inhibitions of IGF-IR stimulated apoptosis and prevented the prosurvival effect of fibronectin in PaCa cells. Our data indicate that fibronectin protects from apoptosis through trans-activation of IGF-IR. We showed that fibronectin stimulated complex formation between its receptor β3 integrin and protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. This process of complex formation, in turn, prevents SHP-2 from dephosphorylating IGF-IR resulting in sustained phosphorylation of IGF-IR and leading to the downstream activation of Akt kinase, up-regulation of antiapoptotic BclxL, and inhibition of apoptosis. Among ECM proteins tested only fibronectin and laminin but not vitronectin and collagen I stimulated trans-activation of IGF-IR. Interaction of fibronectin with β3 but not β1 integrin receptors mediates the survival pathway. In contrast, fibronectin-induced adhesion is mediated through β1 integrin receptor and is IGF-IR-independent. Thus, our results indicate that the prosurvival effect of fibronectin in PaCa cells is mediated by trans-activation of IGF-IR induced by the β3 integrin receptor. The data suggest IGF-IR as a key target for prevention of the prosurvival effects of ECM proteins and growth factors in pancreatic cancer.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of death in western countries with almost the same rate of incidence and mortality per year (1Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar, 2Parker S.L. Tong T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA Cancer J. Clin. 1997; 47: 5-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). The disease is very resistant to radio- and/or chemotherapies. One reason for that is the resistance of pancreatic cancer (PaCa) 2The abbreviations used are:PaCapancreatic cancerECMextracellular matrixIGFinsulin-like growth factorIGF-IRinsulin-like growth factor-I receptorAMCaminomethylcoumarinp-phospho-polyHEMApoly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)siRNAsmall interfering RNAAnVAnnexin VPIpropidium iodideCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayANOVAanalysis of variancePI3Kphosphatidylinositide 3-kinase cells to apoptosis (3Westphal S.

ECM mediates adhesion and invasiveness of cancer cells. Cell survival also depends on adequate connections with ECM proteins through specific integrin receptors. We recently showed that ECM proteins are key mediators of PaCa cell survival (4Sekharam M. Zhao H. Sun M. Fang Q. Zhang Q. Yuan Z. Dan H.C. Boulware D. Cheng J.Q. Coppola D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7708-7716PubMed Google Scholar, 5Vaquero E.C. Edderkaoui M. Pandol S.J. Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34643-34654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and that detachment from ECM stimulates PaCa cell death. The mechanisms through which ECM proteins protect PaCa cells from death are not fully understood. Fibronectin is a major ECM protein of pancreatic adenocarcinoma; its receptors, β3 and β1 integrins, are up-regulated in pancreatic cancer cells (6Linder S. Castanos-Velez E. von Rosen A. Biberfeld P. Hepatogastroenterology. 2001; 48: 1321-1327PubMed Google Scholar). Fibronectin stimulates invasion and adhesion and markedly increases survival of pancreatic cancer cells (7Edderkaoui M. Hong P. Vaquero E.C. Lee J.K. Fischer L. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Lerch M.M. Pandol S.J. Gukovskaya A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G1137-G1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 8Vaquero E.C.

The importance of fibronectin and other extracellular matrix proteins in pancreatic cancer is underscored by several findings. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most lethal of human cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5% (9Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Murray T. Xu J. Smigal C. Thun M.J. CA Cancer J. Clin. 2006; 56: 106-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5532) Google Scholar). This cancer has a characteristic of marked desmoplasia, which is a remarkable increase in extracellular matrix that infiltrates and envelopes the cancer (10Mollenhauer J. Roether I. Kern H.F. Pancreas. 1987; 2: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Importantly there is at least one report that demonstrates that greater amounts of intratumor extracellular matrix in pancreatic cancer patients are correlated with more aggressive disease and more rapid death (11Watanabe I. Hasebe T. Sasaki S. Konishi M. Inoue K. Nakagohri T. Oda T. Mukai K. Kinoshita T. Pancreas. 2003; 26: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Finally recent studies in animal models of pancreatic cancer show that tumors grow more rapidly when the fibroblastic cells of the cancer called stellate cells are included in inocula with cancer cells (12Bachem M.G. Schunemann M. Ramadani M. Siech M. Beger H. Buck A. Zhou S. Schmid-Kotsas A. Adler G. Gastroenterology. 2005; 128: 907-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The addition of the stellate cells results in the experimental tumors taking on the characteristics of the human cancer with the extracellular matrix infiltrating and enveloping the cancer cells. In addition, another powerful mediator of PaCa cell survival is insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Both IGF-I and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) are overexpressed in human pancreatic tumors as well as in pancreatic cancer cell lines (13Bergmann U. Funatomi H. Yokoyama M. Beger H.G. Korc M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2007-2011PubMed Google Scholar, 14Karna E. Surazynski A. Orlowski K. Laszkiewicz J. Puchalski Z. Nawrat P. Palka J. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2002; 83: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Blockade of the IGF-IR by a dominant negative inhibitor suppresses tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo and increases sensitivity of pancreatic tumors to radiation and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. The key event in IGF-I-induced signaling is phosphorylation of IGF-I receptor kinase followed by the activation of the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which mediates the antiapoptotic effect of IGF-I (4Sekharam M. Zhao H. Sun M. Fang Q. Zhang Q. Yuan Z. Dan H.C. Boulware D. Cheng J.Q. Coppola D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7708-7716PubMed Google Scholar). Another important step in IGF-I-induced signaling is phosphorylation of adapter protein SHPS-1 leading to the recruitment of Src homology 2-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. SHP-2 is a negative regulator of IGF-IR signaling. It dephosphorylates IGF-IR resulting in the inhibition of its signaling (15El Annabi S. Gautier N. Baron V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Very little is known on the role of IGF-IR in the effects of ECM proteins. In contrast the contribution of integrins in the signaling induced by exogenous IGF-I cells was established in several publications mostly in smooth muscle cells (16Maile L.A. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3519-3528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ling Y. Maile L.A. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In these cells IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of β3 integrins results in recruitment of phosphatase SHP-2, which is required for proper IGF-IR phosphorylation. Both β3 and SHP-2 knock-downs result in the inhibition of functional IGF-I responses, proliferation, and migration (16Maile L.A. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3519-3528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that prosurvival effects of fibronectin are mediated by IGF-IR trans-activation. Vitronectin and collagen, which had no effect on cell survival, do not trans-activate IGF-IR. Adhesion is not required for fibronectin-induced IGF-IR trans-activation. Furthermore IGF-IR is not involved in fibronectin-induced adhesion of PaCa cells. Fibronectin transactivates IGF-IR by preventing receptor dephosphorylation. Fibronectin stimulates complex formation between its receptor β3 integrin and protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. This in turn prevents SHP-2 from dephosphorylating IGF-IR resulting in sustained phosphorylation of IGF-IR and leading to the downstream activation of Akt kinase, up-regulation of anti-apoptotic BclxL, and inhibition of apoptosis. Our results indicate that interaction between IGF-IR and β3 integrin plays a different role in the effects of fibronectin and IGF-I. Inhibition of apoptosis by fibronectin is mediated by SHP-2 immobilization away from IGF-IR and is mimicked by SHP-2 knockdown. In contrast IGF-I signaling as well as downstream proliferation and migration are inhibited by SHP-2 knockdown (16Maile L.A. Badley-Clarke J. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3519-3528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reagents—Ac-DEVD-AMC (Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin) was from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Antibodies against IGF-IR, SHP-2, BclxL, and insulin blocking peptide were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against α2 and β3 integrins and the blocking antibodies against β1 and β3 integrins were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). αV antibody and IGF-I blocking antibody were from Calbiochem, phospho-Akt (p-Akt) antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), p-IGF-IR antibody was from Upstate, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and platelet-derived growth factor blocking antibody was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). All other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Culture—Human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, the poorly differentiated MIA PaCa-2 and the slightly differentiated PANC-1, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells were grown in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 4 mml-glutamine, and antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were used between passages 4 and 12. MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106/ml on 100-mm culture dishes coated with either poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (polyHEMA), fibronectin, collagen I, vitronectin, or soluble fibronectin (Arg-Gly-Asp); cultured for up to 48 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium; collected; and processed for the specified analyses. PolyHEMA prevents both cell attachment on plastic and endogenous cell matrix deposition (18Folkman J. Moscona A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). Plates were coated twice with 3 ml of polyHEMA dissolved in 95% ethanol (10 mg/ml), allowed to dry, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before use. Compared with polyHEMA, we observed similar but less pronounced responses in cells grown on plastic or on plastic coated with polylysine (19Han S.W. Roman J. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4341-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Plates coated with human fibronectin, collagen I, vitronectin, or soluble fibronectin (Sigma) were prepared by applying at 2 μg/cm2 the specified protein for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were cultured for 48 h or the indicated time in the absence of serum. Inhibitors or the same amount of vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to the culture medium just before plating the cells. In all experiments, the total amount of cells (attached and non-attached) was collected and analyzed. Transfections—Transfection of MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells with antisense oligonucleotides or siRNA was done using Nucleofector™ II (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 200 nm IGF-IR antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (AS, 5′-GGA CCC TCC TCC GGA GCC) was applied for a 60-mm dish. The IGF-IR scrambled oligonucleotides (5′-CGT CGG AGG ATG CCA CGG) were used as a control. Transfection with SHP-2 antisense oligonucleotides was performed using the same technique with SHP-2 antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (SHP-2 AS, 5′-TCC GCG ATG TCA TGT TCC TC) and SHP-2 scrambled phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (5′-CGT CCA GAC CAA GGA CGA GCT) as a control. For siRNA transfection, 200 nm IGF-IR siRNA 5′-GGU CUU CUC ACA CAU CGG C, IGF-I siRNA 5′-GGG UUG GAA GAC UGC UGA UTT, or control siRNA 5′-GCG CAU UGC AGU CAA GAG G (MWG-Biotech, High Point, NC) was applied. The efficiency of transfection assessed by expression of the green fluorescent protein-containing plasmid was about 80–90% in both MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cell lines. The specificity of IGF-IR and SHP-2 antisense oligonucleotides and IGF-IR and IGF-I siRNA was checked by using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) to compare their sequences against the human genome. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were incubated in a lysis buffer (0.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysis buffer was supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors pepstatin, leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, and aprotinin, each at 5 μg/ml. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Supernatants were collected, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (4 mm Tris base, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 2 h with the indicated primary antibodies and then for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Blots were developed with the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (enhanced chemiluminescence) (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was done according to the Catch and Release Reversible Immunoprecipitation System protocol (Upstate, Inc.). Cell lysates were prepared as mentioned in the Western blot protocol. They were then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentration was measured. The supernatant was added to the antibody capture affinity ligand and the specific antibody and incubated in a Catch and Release spin column at room temperature for 1 h under continuous shaking. The column was then washed three times with the wash buffer (10% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 150 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). The immunoprecipitate was then eluted with Tris-based immunoprecipitation elution buffer and analyzed by Western blotting as described before. Measurements of Apoptosis—Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was measured by using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPlus kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phosphatidylserine externalization was analyzed with the Annexin-V-FLUOS Staining kit from Roche Applied Science as we described before (8Vaquero E.C. Edderkaoui M. Nam K.J. Gukovsky I. Pandol S.J. Gukovskaya A.S. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1188-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells were collected and resuspended at a density of 1 × 106 cells in 500 μl of binding buffer containing 2 μl of Annexin V (AnV) and 1 μl propidium iodide (PI), incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Effector caspase (DEVDase) activity was measured by a fluorogenic assay in whole cell lysates using DEVD-AMC as a substrate as we described before (8Vaquero E.C. Edderkaoui M. Nam K.J. Gukovsky I. Pandol S.J. Gukovskaya A.S. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1188-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The lysate (50–100 μgof protein) was incubated with 10 μm substrate in a reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C. Caspase substrate cleavage releases AMC, which emits fluorescent signal with 380 nm excitation and 440 nm emission. Fluorescence was calibrated using a standard curve for AMC. Adhesion Assay—96-well plates were coated with fibronectin. The adhesion assay was then performed as described previously (20Trikha M. De Clerck Y.A. Markland F.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4993-4998PubMed Google Scholar) with minor changes. Briefly the adhesive cells were stained with crystal violet, and the optical density was measured at 550 nm. IGF-I Measurement—IGF-I level was measured using the ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Antigenix America Inc.). Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis using unpaired Student's t test was done to analyze differences between two conditions. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple comparisons using the Student-Newman-Keuls test were used to analyze differences between several conditions. Pharmacological and Molecular Inhibitions of IGF-IR Prevent the Antiapoptotic Effect of Fibronectin in Pancreatic Cancer Cells—In accord with our previous publications (7Edderkaoui M. Hong P. Vaquero E.C. Lee J.K. Fischer L. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Lerch M.M. Pandol S.J. Gukovskaya A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G1137-G1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 8Vaquero E.C.

Importantly combination of fibronectin and IGF-I did not further decrease apoptosis in comparison with fibronectin or IGF-I alone (Fig. 1A) suggesting that the prosurvival pathways of IGF-I and fibronectin overlap possibly through activating the same prosurvival target such as IGF-IR. To explore the role of IGF-IR activation in the prosurvival effect of fibronectin, we showed that the inhibitory effects of fibronectin on different parameters of apoptosis were completely prevented by the IGF-IR-specific inhibitor AG1024 (Fig. 1, B–D). Of note, AG1024 belongs to the tyrphostin family; it selectively inhibits the IGF-IR autophosphorylation (21Parrizas M. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Wertheimer E. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In particular, in the presence of AG1024, fibronectin did not decrease DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activity and did not stimulate the survival rate in PaCa cells (Fig. 1, B–D). Similarly transfection of MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells with IGF-IR antisense oligonucleotides significantly increased DNA fragmentation in cells cultured on fibronectin (Fig. 2A). Furthermore the prosurvival effect of fibronectin was abolished in cells transfected with siRNA against IGF-IR (Fig. 2B). Thus, the combined results of Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that IGF-IR mediates the prosurvival/antiapoptotic effect of fibronectin in pancreatic cancer cells.FIGURE 2Molecular knockdown of IGF-IR inhibits the prosurvival effect of fibronectin. MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells were cultured on polyHEMA or fibronectin for 48 h. A and B, cells were transfected with 200 nm IGF-IR antisense (As) or scrambled (Sc) oligonucleotides and then cultured for 48 h on polyHEMA or fibronectin. C, cells were transfected with 200 nm IGF-IR or control siRNA and then cultured for 48 h on polyHEMA or fibronectin. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit. Values are normalized to those for cells transfected with scrambled oligonucleotides (A and B) or control siRNA (C) and cultured on polyHEMA (A and C) or on fibronectin (B). Values are means ± S.E.

PolyHEMA prevents cells from attaching and also prevents extracellular matrix deposition (18Folkman J. Moscona A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that fibronectin time-dependently increased the level of IGF-IR phosphorylation in MIA PaCa-2 (Fig. 3, A and B) and PANC-1 (Fig. 3, C and D) cells suggesting that IGF-IR is transactivated by fibronectin. The increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation was already evident at 2 min and was maximal at 5 min. It reached 6-fold in MIA PaCa-2 and 3-fold in PANC-1 cells and was sustained for up to 24 h (Fig. 3, B and D). There were no changes in IGF-IR phosphorylation in cells cultured on polyHEMA or polylysine (not shown) in the same conditions. To test the effect of other matrices on IGF-IR phosphorylation, we cultured MIA PaCa-2 cells on polyHEMA, plastic, collagen I, vitronectin, laminin, and fibronectin and on plastic in the presence of soluble fibronectin fragments (Arg-Gly-Asp) for 5 min and measured the phosphorylation level of IGF-IR. Fig. 4A shows that culturing on plastic, collagen I, and vitronectin did not increase phosphorylation of IGF-IR as compared with that on polyHEMA. Similarly neither vitronectin nor collagen I affected PaCa cell survival (Fig. 4C). Up-regulation of phosphorylated IGF-IR was only observed in cells cultured on fibronectin and to a lesser extent on laminin and soluble fibronectin (Fig. 4A). These three matrices were able to support PaCa cell survival (Fig. 4C). Thus, the ability of ECM proteins to inhibit apoptosis correlates with their ability to increase the level of IGF-IR phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and C). Of note, integrin receptors for vitronectin and collagen I are present in MIA PaCa-2 cells (Fig. 4D). Results with soluble fibronectin indicate that fibronectin stimulates IGF-IR phosphorylation even in non-adhered cells. The Fibronectin-induced Phosphorylation of IGF-IR and Protection from Apoptosis Are Independent of IGF-I—The effects of fibronectin on IGF-IR phosphorylation could be due to the increased level of IGF-I in extracellular medium and its interaction with IGF-IR. To determine the role of IGF-I in the effects of fibronectin we used several approaches. First we measured the effect of fibronectin on the extracellular level of IGF-I in MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. Fig. 5A shows that in cells cultured on polyHEMA or fibronectin the extracellular level of IGF-I was undetectable by ELISA (less than 0.02 pg/mg of protein). Fibronectin did not increase the level of extracellular IGF-I. Next the levels of IGF-I in cell lysates were the same as the levels in cells cultured on polyHEMA and fibronectin. Finally we showed that the blockade of IGF-I with IGF-I blocking antibody did not affect the phosphorylated level of IGF-IR in MIA PaCa-2 cells cultured on fibronectin (Fig. 5B). Blockade of IGF-I also did not prevent inhibition of apoptosis by fibronectin (Fig. 5C), indicating that the prosurvival effect of fibronectin is not mediated through exogenous IGF-I. By contrast, IGF-I blocking antibody abolished the phosphorylation of IGF-IR and inhibition of apoptosis induced by the growth factor IGF-I (Fig. 5, B and C). To assess the involvement of endogenous IGF-I in the prosurvival effect of fibronectin we transfected MIA PaCa-2 cells with IGF-I siRNA. Fig. 5D shows that fibronectin similarly inhibited apoptosis in MIA PaCa-2 wild type and MIA PaCa-2 transfected with IGF-I siRNA. These data indicate that the effects of fibronectin on IGF-IR phosphorylation and apoptosis are not due to an increase in endogenous or exogenous IGF-I. Other ligands, which could directly or indirectly activate IGF-IR, include insulin, IGF-II, and platelet-derived growth factor (22Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Nakano T. Graves L.M. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 23Novosyadlyy R. Dudas J. Pannem R. Ramadori G. Scharf J.G. Lab. Investig. 2006; 86: 710-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Neutralization of insulin, IGF-II, and platelet-derived growth factor did not block the fibronectin-induced increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation, suggesting against their involvement (Fig. 5E). Furthermore neither Src kinase inhibitor PP2 nor Src kinase siRNA affected the fibronectin-induced IGF-IR phosphorylation, suggesting against involvement of Src kinase (not illustrated). Thus, our data suggest that IGF-I is not a critical mediator of the effects of fibronectin on IGF-IR phosphorylation. We cannot exclude, however, that IGF-I at very low concentrations might be present in extracellular medium and may contribute to the basal IGF-IR phosphorylation. Our data also do not exclude involvement of IGF-I-binding proteins in the effects of fibronectin on IGF-I. β3 Integrin Mediates the Fibronectin-induced Phosphorylation of IGF-IR, whereas Only β1 Integrin Is Involved in Cell Adhesion—To assess the involvement of β3 and β1 integrins in the observed IGF-IR phosphorylation, we applied neutralizing anti-β3 and anti-β1 antibodies that were shown before to prevent interaction of fibronectin with the corresponding integrins (24Nam J.O. Kim J.E. Jeong H.W. Lee S.J. Lee B.H. Choi J.Y. Park R.W. Park J.Y. Kim I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25902-25909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 25Tai Y.T.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5850-5858PubMed Google Scholar). The fibronectin-induced increase in phosphorylation of IGF-IR was abolished in cells cultured on fibronectin in the presence of the β3 blocking antibody (Fig. 6C). In contrast, blockade of β1 integrin increased IGF-IR phosphorylation (Fig. 6C). These data indicate that IGF-IR trans-activation is mediated by β3 but not β1 integrins. They further suggest that β1 inhibition potentiates interaction of fibronectin with β3 integrin. The increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation induced by β1 blocking antibody (Fig. 6C) could be due to less competition between β1 and β3 integrins to interact with fibronectin. Next we analyzed the role of adhesion in the effects of fibronectin on IGF-IR phosphorylation. Fig. 6A shows that fibronectin dose-dependently increases adhesion of MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. The effect of fibronectin on adhesion was also time-dependent (Fig. 6B). Neutralizing antibody against β3 integrin produced no effect on adhesion of PANC-1 cells and only delayed adhesion of MIA PaCa-2 cells at early times. By contrast, antibody against β1 integ"
https://openalex.org/W2077330224,"We tested the hypothesis that the serine protease trypsin can indirectly activate the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Experiments were carried out in Xenopus oocytes and examined the effects on the channel formed by all three human ENaC subunits and that formed by Xenopus epsilon and human β and γ subunits (ϵβγENaC). Low levels of trypsin (1–10 ng/ml) were without effects on the oocyte endogenous conductances and were specifically used to test the effects on ENaC. Addition of 1 ng/ml trypsin for 60 min stimulated the amiloride-sensitive human ENaC conductance (gNa) by ∼6-fold. This effect on the gNa was [Na+]-independent, thereby ruling out an interaction with channel feedback inhibition by Na+. The indirect nature of this activation was confirmed in cell-attached patch clamp experiments with trypsin added to the outside of the pipette. Trypsin was comparatively ineffective at activating ϵβγENaC, a channel that exhibited a high spontaneous open probability. These observations, in combination with surface binding experiments, indicated that trypsin indirectly activated membrane-resident channels. Activation by trypsin was also dependent on catalytic activity of this protease but was not accompanied by channel subunit proteolysis. Channel activation was dependent on downstream activation of G-proteins and was blocked by G-protein inhibition by injection of guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate and by pre-stimulation of phospholipase C. These data indicate a receptor-mediated activation of ENaC by trypsin. This trypsin-activated receptor is distinct from that of protease-activated receptor-2, because the response to trypsin was unaffected by protease-activated receptor-2 overexpression or knockdown.

This trypsin-activated receptor is distinct from that of protease-activated receptor-2, because the response to trypsin was unaffected by protease-activated receptor-2 overexpression or knockdown. It is well established that epithelial Na+ transport in a variety of cell types is sensitive to the actions of serine proteases. Prior to the cloning of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), 2The abbreviations used are:ENaCepithelial Na+ channelCAPchannel-activating proteaseHAhemagglutininGDPβSguanyl-5′-yl thiophosphatePAR-2protease-activated receptor-2HRPhorseradish peroxidasePAR-2protease-activated receptor-2PLCphospholipase Cm-3M3FBS2,4,6-trimethyl-N-(meta-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)benzenesulfonamide it was known that apical proteases can degrade apical membrane proteins in toad bladder and inhibit Na+ transport.

Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). It is now accepted that many ENaC-expressing epithelia, including toad bladder, respond to the actions of a variety of series proteases (6Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q.

Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). It is now known that lower levels of serine proteases that do not cause channel degradation actually stimulate activity. This activation is observed by a variety of physiological serine proteases (10Vesey D.A. Hooper J.D. Gobe G.C. Johnson D.W. Nephrology (Carlton). 2007; 12: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), exogenous proteases (11Donaldson S.H. Hirsh A. Li D.C. Holloway G. Chao J. Boucher R.C. Gabriel S.E. J. Biol.

Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P. Stockand J.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Activation of ENaC by exogenous protease or by co-expression with proteases also persists in heterologous expression systems such as Xenopus oocytes; although differences are observed between systems in that many epithelial cells require prolonged prior incubation with a protease inhibitor before observing the effects of exogenous proteases. The mechanisms of serine protease activation remain only partially elucidated with evidence for and against limited channel cleavage or processing. In general, this has proven difficult to determine, because many of the experimental systems used to examine this mechanism only respond at protease levels close to those initially shown to degrade the channel. Adding to this complexity is the emergence of a family of receptors that are G-protein-coupled, membrane-bound, protease-sensitive receptors that may mediate some of the effects of exogenous proteases (12Blackhart B.D. Emilsson K. Nguyen D. Teng W. Martelli A.J. Nystedt S. Sundelin J. Scarborough R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16466-16471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Moreover, these receptors also exhibit differences in their sensitivity to exogenous proteases, which are experimental system dependent. Supporting indirect channel activation is the finding that coexpression of CAP1 or prostasin with ENaC leads to its activation (9Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) but only when this protein remained glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored and membrane-bound (13Vallet V. Pfister C. Loffing J. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 588-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Verghese G. Gutknecht M.F. Caughey G.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1258-C1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similar effects were also observed with trypsin, but only in intact cells (15Chraibi A. Vallet V. Firsov D. Hess S.K. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In these experiments no evidence of ENaC protein cleavage could be found. More recently these authors also found that catalytically inactive CAP1 was still capable of activating ENaC, however, catalytic activity was necessary for the other two CAP isoforms (CAP2 and CAP3) indicating the presence of more than one mechanism of channel activation (16Andreasen D. Vuagniaux G. Fowler-Jaeger N. Hummler E. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Harris M. Firsov D. Vuagniaux G. Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 58-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Supporting channel cleavage is the finding that the cellular protease furin activates ENaC accompanied by a shift in the molecular weight of the α and γ subunits (6Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P. Stockand J.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18111-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Both effects could be abolished by mutation of furin processing consensus sites on these ENaC subunits, indicating that channel cleavage through the biosynthetic pathway leads to its activation. However, these mutations did not affect the response of ENaC to trypsin, and this leaves the possibility that extracellular exogenous proteases may affect ENaC via different mechanisms than the cellular endogenous ones. The lung serine protease, elastase, and trypsin were also found to activate membrane resident ENaC in excised patches from airway epithelia indicating the possibility of channel proteolysis (7Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C190-C194Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 18Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: L813-L819Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Interestingly, exogenous elastase also stimulated ENaC expressed in oocytes, however, this response occurred in the absence of αENaC cleavage and was accompanied by a γENaC cleavage that was different than that observed by normal channel biosynthetic processing (17Harris M. Firsov D. Vuagniaux G. Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 58-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, protease inhibition of elastase did not affect the stimulation of ENaC observed by co-expression with CAP1, further indicating the potential of additional non-cleavage mechanisms for channel activation by exogenous proteases. Trypsin is known to activate ENaC in oocytes at the same concentration as that used in other systems, but without the requirement for prior treatment with a protease inhibitor. However, these levels of trypsin also affect oocyte endogenous channels and are in realty close to those used to degrade channel protein. Therefore, we opted to carry out our experiments at trypsin levels that we found not to affect the endogenous channels. We report that 1 ng/ml trypsin also activated ENaC, albeit at a slower time course than that observed for the microgram/ml levels. This activation occurred in membrane-resident channels and was independent of channel self- or feedback inhibition by Na+. Multiple lines of evidence rule out channel cleavage and indicate a second messenger G-protein-coupled process of activation that is also coupled to membrane phospholipids. This is the first report of channel activation by exogenous protease that rules out channel subunit processing. Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Oocytes were prepared as previously described (19Awayda M.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, surgically removed oocytes were defoliculated in Ca2+-free buffer containing 1 mg/ml collagenase (type 1A, Sigma). After an overnight recovery, defoliculated oocytes were injected with cRNA for the three human ENaC subunits (referred to as αβγENaC or simply ENaC) or for ϵxENaC and βγhENaC (referred to as ϵβγENaC). These, and all other clones, were inserted into the PGEM-HE oocyte expression vector originally described by Liman et al. (20Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). This vector contained 49 and 192 nucleotides from the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the Xenopus β-globin gene on their respective side of the multicloning site. cRNA was synthesized from linearized plasmids using the T7 RNA polymerase Large Scale Production System (Promega, Madison, WI). The X. laevis epsilon ENaC subunit, ϵxENaC (accession number AJ440222), was previously described (21Babini E. Geisler H.S. Siba M. Grunder S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28418-28426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A full-length clone was obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) and subcloned in PGEM-HE. Recordings were carried out 1–3 days after injection. Oocytes used for binding experiments substituted cRNA from an HA-tagged αENaC construct (extracellular loop tag at amino acids 161–169). All ENaC subunit cRNAs were injected at 1–2 ng each. Oocyte incubation and recording solutions were previously described (19Awayda M.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the normal recording solution (ND94) was composed of: 94 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mMCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4–7.5. This is referred to as high Na+ solution. For the low sodium solution, 89 mm NaCl from the previous solution was replaced by 89 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl. Experiments in these oocytes were carried out in the same solution as the incubating one. Given the constitutive Na+ channel activity in oocytes injected with ENaC, incubation in the low Na+ solution effectively clamps the intracellular Na+ concentration to about one-half that of extracellular [Na+] (22Awayda M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C216-C224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in an [Na+]i of ∼2.5 mEq in low Na+ conditions. Amiloride was obtained from Merck Pharmaceuticals (Rahway, NJ) and was used at 10 μm to inhibit ENaC currents. Purified bovine pancreas type I trypsin was obtained from Sigma (∼10,000 units/mg). The response of ENaC to this trypsin was verified using sequencing grade and recombinant proteomics grade trypsin (Roche Applied Science). GDP Injections—At the beginning of these experiments oocytes were impaled with two recording electrodes and a third injecting pipette as previously described (22Awayda M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C216-C224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The injecting pipette was filled with a 10 mm solution of GDPβS. Baseline activity was established for ∼20–30 min, followed by intracellular delivery of GDPβS. At the time of injection, ∼25 nl of solution containing GDPβS was delivered into the oocyte. Using an average oocyte diameter of 1.1 mm, results in a volume of ∼700 nl, or a dilution of ∼1:29 and an estimated final concentration of ∼340 μm GDPβS. Similar concentrations of this and other GTP analogs have been used by others to block oocyte-endogenous and exogenously expressed G-proteins (23Bueno O.F. Robinson L.C. Alvarez-Hernandez X. Leidenheimer N.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 59: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Kamatchi G.L. Tiwari S.N. Chan C.K. Chen D. Do S.H. Durieux M.E. Lynch 3rd., C.

Injection of 25 nl of unrelated solution does not affect the baseline or amiloride-sensitive conductance (26Awayda M.S. Subramanyam M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 97-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The injecting electrode was retained until the end of the experiment. As shown under “Results,” amiloride was added at the beginning and end of the experiment. No significant differences in the amiloride-insensitive currents were observed indicating no appreciable leak currents or conductances introduced by this maneuver. Surface Expression of ENaC—Cell surface expression of HA-tagged ENaC was as previously described (27Awayda M.S. Shao W. Vukojicic I. Bengrine A. Ion Channels “Experimental Procedures” and Protocols. 2006; 337: 101-115Google Scholar, 28Bengrine A. Li J. Awayda M.S. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were divided into groups of 25 oocytes, and anti-HA binding was assessed in each group separately. Each group of 25 oocytes was considered as a single experiment and was obtained from oocytes from separate frogs. Control or ENaC-expressing oocytes were divided into two major groups: untreated and trypsin-treated. Trypsin treatment was carried out for 60 min at room temperature. At the end of this period, oocytes were washed three times with ice-cold ND-94 then transferred to tubes containing anti-HA antibody coupled to HRP (Roche Applied Science) at a final concentration of 0.357 μg/ml in ND-94, supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Antibody binding was carried out for 2 h on ice. Oocytes were then washed extensively (six times) with ice-cold ND-94. Bound antibodies were indirectly detected by measuring HRP activity using Turbo-TMB HRP substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assaying the HRP content of the last wash solution allowed us to verify the effectiveness of washes. Experiments were conducted using ENaC-injected and non-injected oocytes to assess nonspecific binding. The ability of the assay to detect changes of surface binding was tested in oocytes injected with varying levels of ENaC cRNA (27Awayda M.S. Shao W. Vukojicic I. Bengrine A. Ion Channels “Experimental Procedures” and Protocols. 2006; 337: 101-115Google Scholar). Impedance Analysis—Dual electrode voltage clamp was carried out using TEV-200 oocyte clamp (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Impedance was continuously recorded every 10 s (19Awayda M.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The measurement consisted of five sequential discrete sine wave signals ranging from 55 to 390 Hz. The actual current and voltage signals were digitally acquired and used to calculate membrane impedance and consequently values of membrane capacitance (Cm) and conductance (gm). Patch Clamp Analysis—Conditions were as previously described (26Awayda M.S. Subramanyam M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 97-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were shrunk in hypertonic solution, followed by manual removal of the vitelline membrane. Experiments were carried out in the cell-attached patch clamp configuration. Only seals with resistances of >40 gigaohms were used. Data acquisition and analyses utilized the suite of DigiData 1322A, Axopatch 200B, and pClamp9 (Axon Instruments, Carson City, CA). Trypsin was added to the external bath after the formation of a seal and establishing baseline channel activity. This utilized a large tip electrode connected to an additional manipulator and delivered ∼75 μl of ND-94 solution containing 10 ng/ml trypsin onto the surface of the oocyte. Solution delivery rate was controlled by a pressure gradient generated from a Dale 20 Pneumatic transducer (Dale Instruments). Bath solution was ND94, while the electrode solution was a modified ND94 that eliminated K+. The current signal was filtered at 200 Hz and digitally acquired at 1 KHz. ENaC currents were identified from their signature long open and closed times, single channel conductance, current-voltage relationship, and in some experiments partial block by low doses of amiloride. These currents were only observed in ENaC-expressing oocytes. PAR-2 Overexpression, Stimulation, and Inhibition—An X. laevis expressed sequence tag-clone homologous to human protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), was obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). This clone was sequenced, and the full-length coding region (NCBI accession number AAV39393) and 91 and 1301 nucleotides from the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region, respectively, were subcloned into PGEM-HE. xPAR-2 (referred to as PAR-2) cRNA was synthesized in the same manner as the ENaC cRNA. PAR-2 was overexpressed alone or in combination with ENaC. Tagged PAR-2 (referred to as PAR-2-HA) was constructed using a PCR-based approach resulting in the insertion of the HA tag in the C terminus at amino acids 389–397. This allowed us to verify overexpression and knockdown (see below). The sequence of all constructs was experimentally verified. PAR-2 knockdown utilized intracellular injection of a X. laevis PAR-2 antisense morpholino. The morpholino-modified anti-PAR-2 oligonucleotide is shown below in Fig. 11 and was purchased from Gene Tools (Philomath, OR). This oligonucleotide corresponds to the cDNA sequence of X. laevis PAR-2 between nucleotides 195 and 219, spanning the start ATG. Morpholinos were injected directly into oocytes either at the time of ENaC cRNA injection or 1 day later. 50 nl of the morpholino was injected at two different concentrations (final concentrations of ∼10 μm and 100 μm) with no difference in their effect. A control morpholino obtained from Gene Tools was also without effect. Protein knockdown with the anti-PAR-2 morpholino was verified in vivo by examining its effects on PAR-2-HA expression by Western blotting. The antisense morpholino was also verified to inhibit in vitro translated PAR-2 (data not shown). Oocyte Homogenization and Western Blotting—Injected oocytes were processed as previously described (28Bengrine A. Li J. Awayda M.S. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, groups of 50–100 oocytes were homogenized at room temperature in 10 μl/oocyte, in buffer containing 80 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Oocytes were broken by trituration with 25-gauge and 27-gauge syringes. Yolk and nuclei were pelted by centrifugation at low speed (100 × g) for 5 min. Supernatants were spun at high speed (14,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C. This soluble fraction did not contain ENaC or PAR-2 and was not further used. The pellet was dissolved in homogenization buffer containing 1% of Igepal CA-630 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich) at an equivalent of 2 μl/oocyte, and spun for 5 min at high speed to obtain the membrane fraction. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1 or 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for PAR-2 and ENaC, respectively. Blots were then incubated for 1 h in blocking solution containing 50 milliunits/ml of an anti-HA HRP-conjugated antibody (Roche Applied Science), or 0.5 μg/ml of each ENaC subunit-specific antibody (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO). The ENaC subunit-specific antibodies were generated against the following antigenic peptides with their relative position in the ENaC subunit shown in parentheses: L(20)MKGNKREEQGLGPEPAAPQQPT(42) for the anti-α, N(619)YDSLRLQPLDVIESDSEGDAI(640) for the anti-β, and L(630)RLERAFSNQLTDTQMLDEL(649) for the anti-γ antibodies. After five washes, the ENaC blots were incubated for 1 h with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at 20 ng/ml (Pierce). Blots were then washed five times, and bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence Super signal ECL (Pierce). Unless noted otherwise, data are reported as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test at the 99% or 95% confidence levels. [Na+]-Independent Activation by Trypsin—Trypsin is known to activate the oocyte endogenous Ca2+-dependent Cl– channel at microgram/ml levels (29Durieux M.E. Salafranca M.N. Lynch K.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This effect, while transient in nature, may set in motion additional downstream effects that also affect ENaC. For this reason, and the fact that these levels of trypsin are close to those previously used to digest sodium transport proteins at the apical membrane of toad bladder (1Garty H. Edelman I.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 785-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of lower levels of trypsin. As shown in Fig. 1A, addition of 1 ng/ml trypsin led to a slow (∼60 min) but robust increase of ENaC activity. At this concentration, the amiloride-sensitive conductance (a measure of membrane ENaC activity) was increased by 631 ± 47% (n = 23) (Fig. 1B), whereas the comparable untreated time controls increased by 29.6% during the same time period. As shown in Fig. 1A, the amiloride-insensitive component was unchanged before and after trypsin, indicating the absence of effects of this concentration on oocyte endogenous channels, in contrast to that observed at higher levels of trypsin (29Durieux M.E. Salafranca M.N. Lynch K.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The observed stimulation with trypsin was similar in magnitude to (and in most cases larger than) that observed by others using three to five orders of magnitude higher trypsin levels (6Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P. Stockand J.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

Rossier B.C. Hummler E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 828-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected this ∼6-fold stimulation was slower than that observed by others at the higher trypsin levels or by us at 10 ng/ml trypsin (not shown). As demonstrated below, this concentration is ideal, because it allows us to rule out channel cleavage by exogenous trypsin, and unless otherwise noted all of our experiments were limited to this concentration. The effects of trypsin on ENaC required proteolytic activity of this serine protease as channel stimulation was blocked by 20-fold excess soybean trypsin inhibitor (see Fig. 1B for summary). These effects also occurred without changes of membrane capacitance (Cm), which averaged 0.244 ± 0.005 and 0.247 ± 0.005 microfarad (n = 39) before and after trypsin, respectively. This indicates that trypsin-mediated activation of ENaC does not likely involve effects on membrane trafficking, but rather activation of membrane resident channels, as suggested by others (7Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C190-C194Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 15Chraibi A. Vallet V. Firsov D. Hess S.K. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This is further demonstrated below. To test if the effect of trypsin on ENaC is mediated via a relief of Na+ inhibition, as suggested by others (34Sheng S. Carattino M.D. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1488-F1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we examined this response in oocytes incubated (at the time of injection) in a low Na+ solution. This maneuver results in approximately a 20-fold decrease of both intra- and extracellular [Na+] (see “Experimental Procedures”). Under these conditions, it is expected that Na+ self-inhibition as well as feedback inhibition are markedly reduced (22Awayda M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C216-C224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Rossier B.C. Schild L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2741-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Such a procedure is known to increase channel activity, and indeed this effect is evident from the ∼2-fold stimulation of the baseline gNa in the low Na+ solution (Fig. 1, B and D). An example of the effect of trypsin in low Na+ is shown in Fig. 1C, and the data are summarized in Fig. 1D. A similar increase of gNa was observed irrespective of the large change in [Na+]. This indicates that the response to trypsin is independent of channel regulation by Na+."
https://openalex.org/W2088932561,"PGC-1β is a transcriptional coactivator that enhances strongly and in a hormone-dependent manner the activity of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) while having only weak effects on similar steroid hormone receptors, such as ERβ or the glucocorticoid receptor. Notably, PGC-1β enhances ERα transcriptional activity not only in response to agonist ligands, such as estradiol, but also to selective ER modulators, such as tamoxifen. Here, we dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of PGC-1β to act selectively on ERα and to promote the agonist activity of tamoxifen. We show that receptor selectivity is achieved by PGC-1β interactions with not just the ligand binding domain (LBD), which is highly conserved among nuclear receptors, but also the N-terminal domain and the hinge/AF-2a region of ERα, which are less well conserved. PGC-1β interacts directly with the hinge/AF-2a and LBD regions but indirectly and via the coactivator SRC-1 with the N-terminal domain. The three ERα surfaces and SRC-1 collectively enable efficient coactivation by PGC-1β. Similar ERα surfaces and interactions enable PGC-1β to coactivate transcription by tamoxifen-bound ERα. Surprisingly, PGC-1β coactivation of tamoxifen-bound ERα depends partially on one of the LXXLL motifs of PGC-1β and on Lys362 of the ERα LBD (i.e. surfaces implicated in agonist-dependent interactions). Our findings suggest that tamoxifen-induced changes in the ERα LBD promote interactions with the coactivator PGC-1β, which then cooperates with SRC-1 to enable tamoxifen agonism.

Estrogens play important roles in the female reproductive system and impact on the physiology of a broad range of non-reproductive systems, including bone, the cardiovascular and central nervous systems, and glucose and lipid metabolism (1McDonnell D.P.

Because ligand-activated ERs promote beneficial effects in some contexts, such as bone density maintenance, and harmful effects in others, such as the proliferation of breast cancer cells, there is a clinical interest in synthetic ER ligands that act as agonists in some tissues and antagonists in others. Such selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (e.g. tamoxifen) are used to treat estrogen-responsive breast cancers, where they antagonize endogenous estrogen action while maintaining beneficial agonist effects in bone and the cardiovascular system (1McDonnell D.P. Chang C.Y. Norris J.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 949: 16-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Science. 2002; 295: 2380-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The cellular factors that determine the agonistic versus antagonistic properties of tamoxifen and other SERMs are only partially understood (5Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A.

These factors are likely to be important not only for determining the tissue selectivity of SERM action, but also for understanding how breast cancers eventually develop resistance to treatment and start recognizing tamoxifen as an agonist that promotes proliferation (5Katzenellenbogen B.S.

A central DNA binding domain (DBD) mediates recruitment to specific DNA sequences, termed estrogen response elements (EREs). A C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD), separated from the DBD by a short hinge region, serves as the molecular switch that conveys information on the presence and type of ligand. Ligand-activated, DNA-bound ERα regulates the expression of genes via two transcriptional activation functions, denoted AF-1 and AF-2. AF-1 is located in the N-terminal domain of ERα, a region that is not conserved among different nuclear receptors and can activate transcription in a ligand-independent manner. AF-2 is encoded by highly conserved parts of the LBD and is tightly regulated by ligand. The ability of different ERα ligands to act as agonists or antagonists relies largely on their ability to induce distinct conformational changes in the LBD and accordingly modulate the recruitment of coregulators. Agonists direct a small amphipathic helix (helix 12 of the LBD and part of AF-2) to complete the fold of a hydrophobic pocket, which enables the docking of diverse transcriptional coactivators (7Brzozowski A.M.

Antagonists and SERMs, like tamoxifen and raloxifene, block the agonist-dictated positioning of helix 12 and instead allow this helix to dock itself in part of the hydrophobic pocket (7Brzozowski A.M.

This conformation occludes interactions with coactivators and instead is thought to promote the recruitment of corepressors (9Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Since SERMs appear to block AF-2, their agonistic properties depend largely on AF-1. Consequently, SERMs act as agonists in contexts where the AF-1 activity is strong (11Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P.

However, SERMs that differ in their agonistic properties induce distinct conformational changes in the ERα LBD (7Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engstrom O. Ohman L.

Alternatively, the different SERMs may affect differentially interactions with corepressors or enable the recruitment of yet unidentified factors that synergize with AF-1 (13Webb P. Nguyen P.

A large number of coactivators that interact with estradiol-activated ERα and enable its transcriptional function have been identified (17McDonnell D.P. Norris J.D. Science. 2002; 296: 1642-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 18Tremblay G.B. Giguere V. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2002; 12: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Coactivators of the p160 steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family, (SRC-1/NcoA1, GRIP1/TIF2/NcoA2, and pCIP/ACTR/AIB1/RAC3/SRC-3/NcoA3), interact with the AF-2 pocket of the LBD via short amphipathic α-helical motifs with the consensus sequence LXXLL, also called NR boxes (19Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). In addition, SRC coactivators interact with the AF-1 of ERα in a ligand-independent manner (20Webb P. Nguyen P. Shinsako J. Anderson C. Feng W. Nguyen M.P. Chen D. Huang S.M. Subramanian S.

Thus, in the presence of ERα agonists, when both AFs are active, SRC coactivators promote a transcriptional synergism between AF-1 and AF-2 (21Benecke A. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

In the presence of SERMs, SRC coactivator interactions with AF-1 are thought to promote SERM-induced transcription (6Shang Y. Brown M.

Among the SRC family members, SRC-1 in particular has been shown to be important for the agonist activity of tamoxifen in uterine cells, where SRC-1 is expressed at high levels (6Shang Y. Brown M. Science. 2002; 295: 2465-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). The ability of SRC coactivators to enhance tamoxifen-induced transcription can be inhibited by corepressors (23Smith C.L. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). These finding have led to the notion that the relative levels or activity of coactivators and/or corepressors may be responsible for the distinct activities of SERMs in different tissues, as well as for the resistance of breast cancers to tamoxifen treatment (6Shang Y.

PGC-1β (also known as PERC) is a tissue-specifically expressed coactivator of selective nuclear receptors (25Lin J. Puigserver P. Donovan J. Tarr P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol.

PGC-1β shares functional similarities with PGC-1α, such as the ability to interact with NRF-1 and the orphan estrogen-related receptors, and to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism (25Lin J.

However, PGC-1β is an inefficient coactivator of many nuclear receptors that are activated by PGC-1α, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and HNF4 (26Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D.

Notably, PGC-1β activates potently ERα- but not ERβ-mediated transcription, whereas PGC-1α shows no preference between the two ERs (26Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13918-13925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, PGC-1β enhances the agonist activity of tamoxifen, whereas PGC-1α does not (26Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13918-13925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PGC-1β coactivates ERα seems similar to that of other AF-2 coactivators of ERα. Two LXXLL motifs of PGC-1β (termed NR1 and NR2), mediate an interaction with the LBD of ERα in an AF-2- and agonist-dependent manner, whereas a potent N-terminal bipartite activation domain enhances transcription (26Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13918-13925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that enable PGC-1β to coactivate preferentially ERα over other nuclear receptors and to enhance the agonist activity of tamoxifen are not clear. In this study, we elucidate these mechanisms by dissecting the physical and functional interactions of PGC-1β with ERα and with SRC-1. We identify multiple interaction domains that enable PGC-1β to act synergistically with SRC-1 to enhance agonist- as well as SERM-dependent ERα-mediated transcription. Importantly, our findings reveal a role for the ERα LBD, and specifically for an AF-2-like surface, in promoting interactions with PGC-1β in the presence of tamoxifen. These results suggest that specific AF-2 coactivators, such as PGC-1β, can recognize the tamoxifen-induced conformation of the ERα LBD and contribute to the agonistic properties of tamoxifen.

Cell Culture, Transfections, and Ligands—COS7 and U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 9% fetal bovine serum. Medium lacking phenol red and supplemented with charcoal-stripped or charcoal/dextran-treated (HyClone) fetal bovine serum was used when assaying ligand responses. Cells used for luciferase assays were seeded into 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. All transfections included 0.2 μg of p6RlacZ for normalization of transfection efficiency. Amounts of expression and reporter plasmids per transfection are indicated in the figure legends. After overnight exposure to the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate, cells were washed and incubated for an additional 24 h in fresh medium containing the indicated ligands. Assays for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were performed as described (31Knutti D. Kaul A. Kralli A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Luciferase values normalized to β-galactosidase activity are referred to as luciferase units. Data shown represent the mean ± S.D., unless otherwise indicated, of at least four values from two independent experiments performed in duplicates. 17β-estradiol (E2), tamoxifen, and 4-OH-tamoxifen were from Sigma (E8875, T9262, and H7904) and dissolved in 100 or 70% ethanol. The raloxifene analogue LY117018 (dissolved in 100% ethanol) was kindly provided by Lilly. GST Pull-down Interaction Assay—Expression of GST fusion proteins in the E. coli strain BL21 was induced by the addition of 250 μl of 100 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a 50-ml culture that was pregrown at 37 °C to an A600 of around 0.5. The induced culture was then grown for 3 h at room temperature, and the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (PBS*), frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –70 °C. Cells were resuspended in 2.5 ml of PBS*, supplemented with 250 μl of freshly prepared lysozyme (10 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA; Sigma), and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were prepared by sonication and then mixed with 125 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cell lysates were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysates were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) that had been washed once with PBS* containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The beads were subsequently washed twice with 2 ml of PBS* containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and once with 2 ml of Binding Buffer* (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), resuspended in 0.5 ml of Binding Buffer*, and stored at 4 °C. The integrity and amount of the bound GST fusion proteins were determined by SDS-PAGE using different amounts of bovine serum albumin as a standard for protein concentration. The [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated proteins were generated by the TNT ® T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions using EasyTag™ l-[35S]methionine (specific activity 1175 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as label. Labeled in vitro translated protein (5 μl) was added to 40 μl of beads containing ∼1 μg of GST fusion protein that had been diluted with a 50% slurry of washed empty Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma) and 125 μl of Binding Buffer* in 1.5-ml screw cap tubes. This mix was incubated for 1 h at room temperature on an end over end tube rotator. The beads were then washed four times with 0.5 ml of Binding Buffer*, and bound proteins were eluted in 30 μl of 2× loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Western Analysis—Cells were lysed either in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, or in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Cell lysates were subjected to Western analysis using antibodies directed against the HA epitope (mouse monoclonal HA.11 (clone 16B12), Babco), an epitope in the N-terminal 56 amino acids of ERα (mouse monoclonal anti-ERα Ab-15; NeoMarkers), or a peptide mapping in the hinge region of human ERα (rabbit polyclonal anti-hERα (G-20), sc-544; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Efficient Coactivation by PGC-1β Requires the AF-1 Domain of ERα—The agonist activity of tamoxifen has been attributed to the ability of this ligand to promote the transcriptional function of the AF-1 domain of ERα (11Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 12Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Because PGC-1β enhances the agonist activity of tamoxifen (26Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13918-13925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we reasoned that PGC-1β may interact functionally with the AF-1 domain. To test this hypothesis, we compared the ability of PGC-1β to coactivate full-length ERα versus a variant of ERα that lacks AF-1 (ERα.ΔAF-1). As previously reported, PGC-1β expression in COS7 cells enhanced potently the E2-dependent activation of an ERE-driven luciferase reporter by full-length ERα (Fig. 1A). This enhancement was significantly lower for the ERα.ΔAF-1 variant, suggesting that AF-1 is required for an efficient response to PGC-1β. A similar requirement for AF-1 was seen in HeLa cells (data not shown). Full-length ERα and ERα.ΔAF-1 were expressed at comparable levels, suggesting that differences in expression could not account for the different responses to PGC-1β (Fig. 1B). Moreover, a requirement for AF-1 was not evident when ERα was coexpressed with a different coactivator, PGC-1α (Fig. 1A). Next, we asked whether the AF-1 of ERα was sufficient to convert a nuclear receptor that is poorly coactivated by PGC-1β, like GR (26Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13918-13925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), to one that responds efficiently to PGC-1β. To this end, we replaced the AF-1 of GR with the AF-1 of ERα and compared the responses of the chimeric ERα(AF-1)-GR and of wild-type GR to PGC-1β. As seen in Fig. 1C, ERα(AF-1)-GR was coactivated robustly, around 20-fold, by PGC-1β. In contrast, PGC-1β had at most a 2-fold effect on the activity of wild-type GR, as shown previously (26Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13918-13925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the AF-1 of ERα is not only required for efficient coactivation by PGC-1β but can also confer responsiveness to PGC-1β when fused to a heterologous receptor DBD and LBD. PGC-1β Is Not a Direct AF-1 Coactivator—The AF-1 requirement for efficient coactivation by PGC-1β may reflect a direct physical interaction between AF-1 and PGC-1β, analogous to interactions of AF-1 with other coactivators, such as SRC-1 (20Webb P. Nguyen P. Shinsako J. Anderson C. Feng W. Nguyen M.P. Chen D. Huang S.M. Subramanian S. McKinerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1605-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To address this possibility, we first asked whether PGC-1β enhances the transcriptional activity of the N-terminal domain of ERα fused to the DBD of Gal4 (AF-1/G4). Established AF-1 coactivators, such as SRC-1e, GRIP1, and CBP, stimulated the activity of AF-1/G4, as expected (Fig. 2A). In contrast, PGC-1β decreased the activity of the ERα AF-1 (Fig. 2A). Similarly, whereas a VP16-SRC-1e fusion protein was even more potent than SRC-1e in activating AF-1/G4, VP16-PGC-1β reduced ERα AF-1 activity (data not shown). Next, we asked if PGC-1β and the AF-1 of ERα interact physically in vitro. Using bacterially expressed AF-1 of ERα and in vitro translated PGC-1β, we did not detect an interaction (Fig. 2B). Under the same conditions, SRC-1e and GRIP1 interacted efficiently with GST-ERα.AF-1, as expected for AF-1 coactivators (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these findings suggest that PGC-1β is not a direct AF-1 coactivator. The Hinge/AF-2a Region of ERα Contributes to the Coactivation of ERα by PGC-1β—Because PGC-1β does not interact directly with the AF-1 of ERα and yet enhances the activity of tamoxifen-bound ERα (26Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13918-13925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), a context where coactivator interactions with AF-2 are thought to be blocked, we next asked whether PGC-1β interacts with other domains of ERα. Indeed, PGC-1β enhanced the activity of the variant ERα.N341, which includes AF-1, the DBD, the hinge region, and most of AF-2a, a domain (aa 282–351) previously shown to carry an independent activation function (32Norris J.D.

https://openalex.org/W1987089754,"Heparanase is a mammalian endo-beta-D-glucuronidase capable of cleaving HS side chains at a limited number of sites, activity that is strongly implicated in tumor metastasis, neovascularization, inflammation, and autoimmunity. Clinically, up-regulation of heparanase mRNA and protein expression has been documented in a variety of primary human tumors, correlating with reduced postoperative survival and increased lymph node and distant metastasis, thus providing strong clinical support for the prometastatic feature of the enzyme and making it an attractive target for the development of anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. Screening a panel of monoclonal antibodies for their ability to inhibit heparanase enzymatic activity, we noted that one hybridoma, 6F8, exhibited the opposite effect and significantly enhanced heparanase activity. Here, we provide evidence that antibody 6F8 enhances the activity of recombinant and cellular heparanase, facilitates invasion of tumor-derived cells in vitro, and improves wound healing in a mouse punch model in vivo. These results support a role of heparanase in the course of wound healing and, moreover, suggest that monoclonal antibodies can be applied clinically for the enhancement, rather than inhibition, of certain enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2017848952,"The chemokine receptor CCR5 plays an important role as an entry gate for the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and for viral postentry events. Among signal transducers used by chemoattractant receptors, the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D (PLD) produces large amounts of second messengers in most cell types. However, the relevance of PLD isoforms to CCR5 signaling and HIV-1 infection process remains unexplored. We show here that CCR5 activation by MIP-1beta in HeLa-MAGI cells triggered a rapid and substantial PLD activity, as assessed by mass choline production. This activity required the activation of ERK1/2-MAP kinases and involved both PLD1 and PLD2. MIP-1beta also promoted the activation of an HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by the transactivator Tat in HeLa P4.2 cells through a process involving ERK1/2. Expression of wild-type and catalytically inactive PLDs dramatically boosted and inhibited the LTR activation, respectively, without altering Tat expression. Wild-type and inactive PLDs also respectively potentiated and inhibited HIV-1(BAL) replication in MAGI cells. Finally, in monocytic THP-1 cells, antisense oligonucleotides to both PLDs dramatically inhibited the HIV-1 replication. Thus, PLD is activated downstream of ERK1/2 upon CCR5 activation and plays a major role in promoting HIV-1 LTR transactivation and virus replication, which may open novel perspectives to anti-HIV-1 strategies."

It was found that β4a reduced microtubule assembly in proportion to its abundance and thereby caused supersensitivity to microtubule disruptive drugs such as colcemid, vinblastine, and nocodazole. However, the response to paclitaxel was more complex. Low expression of β4a caused supersensitivity to paclitaxel, whereas higher expression resulted in the loss of supersensitivity. The results suggest that β4a may possess an enhanced ability to bind paclitaxel that increases sensitivity to the drug and acts substoichiometrically. At high levels of β4a expression, however, microtubule disruptive effects counteract the assembly promoting pressure exerted by paclitaxel binding, and drug supersensitivity is lost. β4a-Tubulin differs from the more ubiquitous β4b isotype at relatively few amino acid residues, yet β4b expression has little effect on microtubule assembly or drug response. To determine which amino acids mediate the effects of β4a expression, β4a and β4b were altered by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The introduction of N332S or N335S mutations into β4b-tubulin was sufficient to confer microtubule disruption and increased colcemid sensitivity. On the other hand, mutation of Ala115 to serine in β4a-tubulin almost completely reversed heightened sensitivity to paclitaxel, but introduction of an S115A mutation into β4b had no effect, suggesting that a complex interaction of multiple amino acids are necessary to produce this phenotype.

Vertebrate tubulin is encoded by at least six α- and seven β-tubulin genes that produce a highly conserved family of proteins (1Sullivan K.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 687-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). A region of especially high variability among the β-tubulins in any given species, however, occurs in the C-terminal 15 amino acids, and these variable sequences are conserved across species. This observation has led to the classification of β-tubulin into discreet classes or isotypes (2Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Some of these isotypes are expressed in virtually all tissues of an organism, whereas expression of others is tissue-restricted (3Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of multiple tubulin genes along with evidence of tissue-specific expression has long fueled speculation that specific tubulin isotypes subserve specific functions (4Fulton C. Simpson P.A. Goldman R. Pollard T. Rosenbaum J. Cell Motility. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1976: 987-1006Google Scholar), but there has been little evidence to support this notion.Early transfection studies in mammalian cells established that microtubules are composed from all of the available tubulin proteins but provided little evidence of unique roles for any of the examined isotypes (5Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6Joshi H.C. Cleveland D.W. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1990; 16: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In vitro studies, however, gave hints that some isotypes of β-tubulin may possess unique properties that could potentially alter the behavior of the microtubules into which they incorporate. For example, differences in rates of assembly, dynamic behavior, and drug binding for some of the isotypes have been reported (3Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, several laboratories have observed overexpression of specific β-tubulin isotypes in cell lines selected for resistance to paclitaxel and have suggested that this overexpression was responsible for the drug resistance phenotype (7Burkhart C.A. Kavallaris M. Horwitz S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1471: O1-O9PubMed Google Scholar).To explore how tubulin composition might affect microtubule assembly and drug response in living cells, we undertook a direct approach in which we transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) 2The abbreviations used are:CHOChinese hamster ovaryGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutinin antigenαMEMα modification of minimum essential mediumPBSphosphate-buffered saline 2The abbreviations used are:CHOChinese hamster ovaryGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutinin antigenαMEMα modification of minimum essential mediumPBSphosphate-buffered saline cells with cDNAs encoding various β-tubulin isotypes and placed the transcription of the cDNAs under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter to limit potential toxicity from their overexpression. In previous work, we reported that overexpression of β1-, β2-, and β4b-tubulin had no effect on microtubule assembly or response of the cells to antimitotic drugs (8Blade K. Menick D.R. Cabral F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We later reported that overexpression of β3-tubulin, a brain-specific isotype, did cause microtubule disruption and weak paclitaxel resistance when expressed at high levels (9Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and that overexpression of β5-tubulin, a minor ubiquitous isotype, produced major disruption of microtubules and paclitaxel resistance even at moderate levels of expression (10Bhattacharya R. Cabral F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3123-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contradiction to previous studies linking its overexpression to paclitaxel resistance (11Jaffrezou J.P.

Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), produces increased paclitaxel sensitivity. Higher expression, however, inhibits microtubule assembly, causes increased sensitivity to microtubule disruptive drugs, and counteracts the paclitaxel-supersensitive phenotype.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmids—Cβ1 (14Boggs B. Cabral F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2700-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) is a hamster class I β-tubulin (GenBank™ accession number U08342); Mβ4 (GenBank™ accession number NM_009451) and Mβ3 (GenBank™ accession number NM_146116) are mouse class IVa and IVb β-tubulins (15Wang D. Villasante A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). All three cDNAs were cloned into tetracycline-regulated expression vector pTOPneo (16Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and modified to encode a 9-amino acid hemagglutinin antigen (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) at their C termini. These tubulins are hereafter called HAβ1, HAβ4a, and HAβ4b. HAβ4a mutations (N58K, A115S, F159Y, S332N, and S335N), and HAβ4b mutations (K58N, S115A, Y159F, N332S, and N335S) were created using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmids were sequenced to ensure that the expected mutations were present and that no additional changes in the tubulin coding sequences were introduced during the process.Transfection and Selection of Stable Cell Lines—CHO/tTA 6.6a cells, which express the tetracycline-regulated transactivator (16Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), were maintained in α modification of minimum essential medium (αMEM; Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, the cells were trypsinized and seeded into 60-mm dishes containing αMEM with 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for the selection of stable cell lines. After 7 days, G418-resistant colonies were isolated and screened by immunofluorescence and Western blots for tetracycline-regulated expression of exogenous tubulin. Stable cell lines were maintained in αMEM containing G418 and tetracycline to repress the expression of the cDNAs until the time of analysis.Electrophoretic Techniques—The cells were grown in 24-well dishes for 24 h with or without tetracycline and lysed in 1% SDS. The proteins were precipitated with 5 volume of acetone, resuspended in SDS loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol), resolved in 8% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). The membranes were stained with a mixture of TUB 2.1 (1:2,000 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich) that recognizes both endogenous and transfected β-tubulin, and actin antibody C4 (1:30,000; Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) as a loading control. Chemiluminescence was carried out by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), followed by SuperSignal chemiluminescence detection (Pierce) and exposure to x-ray film.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The cells were grown on sterile glass coverslips for 48 h to ∼50% confluence. They were briefly washed with PBS and gently lysed in a microtubule-stabilizing buffer (MTB; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 4 μg/ml paclitaxel (all from Sigma-Aldrich) for 90 s at 4 °C and fixed in methanol at -20 °C for at least 30 min. The fixed cells were rehydrated in PBS for 15 min and incubated in affinity purified rabbit HA antibody (Bethyl Laboratories; 1:100 dilution) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, 1:50 dilution) and 1 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole. After washing in PBS, the coverslips were inverted onto 5 μl of Gel/Mount (BioMeda Corp., Foster City, CA) and viewed with an Optiphot microscope equipped with a Plan Apochromat 60×, 1.4 numerical aperture oil objective (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY). The images were acquired using a MagnaFire digital camera (Optronics, Goleta, CA).Measurement of Drug Sensitivity—A colony formation assay was used to determine the sensitivities of stable cell lines to various drugs. Approximately 200 cells were seeded into replicate wells of 24-well dishes containing increasing concentrations of drug in αMEM with or without tetracycline and incubated for 7 days until visible colonies appeared. The cells were then stained with 0.5% methylene blue in water for 2 h. The excess dye was washed away, and the dishes were dried. The dye from each well was extracted with 200 μl of 1% SDS, and optical density was measured at 630 nm using an Emax plate reader (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA).Measurement of Steady State Microtubule Assembly—Stable cell lines were plated in triplicate wells of a 24-well dish and incubated in αMEM with or without tetracycline for 24 h. The cells were gently washed with PBS and scraped into 200 μl of MTB containing 0.14 m NaCl and 4 μg/ml paclitaxel. This buffer prevents the depolymerization of microtubules but does not promote further assembly (17Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lysates were transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, briefly vortexed, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions containing free tubulin dimers were transferred to a new tube, and the pellet fractions containing microtubules were resuspended in 50 μl of water. To dissolve any residual cellular material remaining in the dish, 100 μl of 1% SDS was added to each well and transferred to the corresponding pellet fraction. An equal volume of bacterial lysate containing glutathione S-transferase fused to α-tubulin (GST-α) was added to each fraction as an external loading control, and the proteins were precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone. The precipitated proteins were dissolved in 50 μl of SDS loading buffer. The proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with a mouse monoclonal antibody to either α-tubulin (DM1A; Sigma-Aldrich) or β-tubulin (TUB 2.1; Sigma-Aldrich), followed by an Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). The fluorescence emission from Alexa 647 was captured using a STORM 860 imager (Molecular Dynamics Inc.) and quantified with NIH Image analysis software. The percentage of total tubulin polymerized into microtubules was calculated by dividing tubulin in the pellet fraction by the total tubulin in pellet and supernatant fractions after first normalizing each value to the amount of GST-α in the corresponding fraction.Statistics—Individual experiments were repeated three to five times, and the significance of any differences between samples was analyzed using Student's t test.RESULTSIsolation of Stable Cell Lines—CHO microtubules are composed of αβ heterodimers containing three β-tubulin isotypes (β1, β4b, and β5) in a ratio of 75:25:5 (18Sawada T. Cabral F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ahmad S. Singh B. Gupta R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of incorporating β4a-tubulin, stably transfected CHO cell lines expressing an HA-tagged β4a cDNA under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter were isolated, and four individual cell lines with different expression levels were chosen for further study. Each cell line was screened by immunofluorescence microscopy to ensure that at least 95% of the cells in each population were positive for HAβ4a expression. The amount of HAβ4a-tubulin produced in each cell line was determined by Western blot analysis with an antibody that recognizes both endogenous β-tubulin and the ectopic HAβ4a-tubulin (Fig. 1). The cell lines were named clones 1–4 in order of increasing HAβ4a expression, which ranged from 18 to 89% of total β-tubulin produced in the cells. In all four cell lines, tetracycline completely repressed the expression of transfected HAβ4a-tubulin (Fig. 1C). An HAβ1 (Fig. 1A) and two HAβ4b cell lines (Fig. 1B) were also isolated to serve as controls in later experiments. Although the β4a and β4b cDNAs we used were derived from mouse rather than hamster, it should be noted that mammalian species have identical amino acid sequences for these isotypes. Also, we previously showed that the presence of a C-terminal HA tag on β-tubulin has no effect on microtubule assembly or the cellular response to antimitotic drugs (16Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Cabral F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).HAβ4a Assembles into the Microtubule Network—The β4a isotype is not normally found in CHO cells, raising the possibility that it might not assemble with the endogenous tubulin. To test this possibility, we removed tetracycline from the culture medium for 2 days to induce expression and stained the cells with antibodies to the HA tag and to α-tubulin. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that HAβ4a was produced in essentially all of the cells, and it colocalized with all of the microtubules identified by α-tubulin staining (Fig. 2). (Note that only the HA staining is shown in the figure because the α-tubulin-stained images were identical.) Cells expressing HAβ1 (Fig. 2A), HAβ4b (Fig. 2B), or moderate amounts of HAβ4a (i.e. clones 1–3; e.g. Fig. 2C), exhibited normal looking cytoplasmic microtubules and bipolar spindles, suggesting that incorporation of HAβ4a did not grossly affect microtubule organization or spindle morphology. Microtubule function was also likely still intact given that the cells had normal proliferation and produced single symmetrical interphase nuclei (e.g. Fig. 2E). Cells with very high expression of HAβ4a (clone 4), however, displayed an altered morphology in which the cells became much larger than normal (Fig. 2D) and had multi-lobed nuclei with evidence of mis-segregated chromosomes that went on to form small restitution nuclei separated from the main nucleus (Fig. 2F, arrows). These morphological changes are similar to those we and others have previously reported for CHO cells with mitotic defects that cause failures in chromosome segregation and an exit from mitosis without cytokinesis (20Abraham I. Marcus M. Cabral F. Gottesman M.M. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Kung A.L. Sherwood S.W. Schimke R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similar to what was reported in those previous studies, cells with high HAβ4a expression produced multipolar spindles with weak spindle fibers (Fig. 2D, inset). Thus, cells can tolerate the lower expression of HAβ4a found in clones 1–3 (18–71% of total β-tubulin), but the very high expression seen in clone 4 (89% of total β-tubulin) interferes with mitosis.FIGURE 2Microtubule organization in cells transfected with HAβ-tubulin. The cells were cultured without tetracycline for 2 days to induce expression of ectopic β-tubulin, extracted with microtubule-stabilizing buffer to remove background soluble tubulin, and fixed in methanol. The cells were then labeled with an antibody to the HA tag followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. A, HAβ1 clone 1; B, HAβ4b clone 1; C, HAβ4a clone 1 (clones 2 and 3 produced similar results); D, HAβ4a clone 4; E, nucleus of HAβ4a clone 1; F, nucleus of HAβ4a clone 4. Mitotic spindles for each of the cell lines are shown in the insets. The arrows point to nuclear fragments produced by nuclear membrane formation around scattered chromosomes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that HAβ4a assembled into all microtubules, the possibility remained that it might assemble with a lower efficiency compared with the endogenous tubulin. To test this possibility, we induced expression for 24 h, lysed the cells with a microtubule-stabilizing buffer, centrifuged to separate nonassembled tubulin (supernatant) from the polymer (pellet), and compared the relative content of endogenous and ectopic tubulin in the two fractions using Western blots with an antibody that recognizes all the β-tubulins. As shown in Fig. 3, the ratio of HAβ4a to endogenous β-tubulin was similar in the supernatant and pellet fractions for all of the clones, arguing that the ectopic tubulin assembles into microtubules with the same efficiency as the endogenous tubulin. Thus, at this level of analysis, HAβ4a appears to be used interchangeably with the endogenous tubulin in microtubule assembly. As we reported previously, transfected HAβ4b and HAβ1 isotypes are also used interchangeably as assessed by similar assays (8Blade K. Menick D.R. Cabral F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Efficiency of HAβ-tubulin incorporation into microtubules. The cells were incubated without tetracycline for 24 h, lysed in microtubule-stabilizing buffer, and centrifuged to separate microtubules in the pellet (P) from soluble tubulin in the supernatant (S). The pellet and supernatant fractions were run on an SDS gel, blotted with Tub 2.1 and Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and imaged by fluorescence detection. Note that the ratio of transfected (HAβ) to endogenous (β) β-tubulin is similar in pellet and supernatant fractions for each of the clones.

To examine this possibility, the extent of cellular microtubule assembly was analyzed by lysing cells with a microtubule-stabilizing buffer and centrifuging the lysate to separate polymerized from nonpolymerized tubulin. Western blot analysis of the two fractions using an antibody to α-tubulin is shown in Fig. 4. In agreement with previous studies (9Hari M. Yang H. Zeng C. Canizales M. Cabral F. Cell Motil.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), ∼38% of the cellular tubulin was found in the microtubule fraction for both HAβ1- and HAβ4b-transfected cells. HAβ4a, however, caused a small but significant reduction in microtubule assembly in an expression-dependent manner, i.e. the percentage of total tubulin in the microtubule fraction decreased progressively from 38% to 26% as the proportion of HAβ4a in the cell increased up to 89%.FIGURE 4Microtubule assembly in transfected cell lines. Wild-type (WT) and HAβ-tubulin transfected cell lines were grown in the absence of tetracycline for 24 h and lysed with a microtubule-stabilizing buffer, centrifuged to separate soluble (S) from polymerized (P) tubulin, run on SDS gels, and blotted with an antibody to α-tubulin. Note that a bacterial extract containing GST-α-tubulin was added to each fraction to act as an internal control. Following quantification of the bands and normalizing to GST-α-tubulin, the percentage of total tubulin appearing in the microtubule-containing pellet fraction (Microtubule Content) was calculated and plotted as a bar graph. Each graph represents the average of at least three independent experiments run in triplicate. The standard deviation from the mean is shown. The Western blots are arranged in the same order as the bar graphs.

Drug Resistance Updates. 2000; 3: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar for review). Given the decrease in microtubule assembly that we observed in HAβ4a-expressing cells, we therefore expected them to exhibit paclitaxel resistance, a result that would have confirmed the correlation between paclitaxel resistance and elevated β4a expression reported by others (11Jaffrezou J.P.

Norris M.D. Haber M. Horwitz S.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1282-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Instead we found that cells with low levels of HAβ4a expression (e.g. clone 1) were more sensitive to paclitaxel than nontransfected cells (Fig. 5A and Table 1). Moreover, this increased sensitivity was lost as the level of HAβ4a expression increased (e.g. clones 2 and 3). It is unlikely that the increased sensitivity to paclitaxel exhibited by clone 1 is due to some other random change in the cell line because multiple clones with low expression possessed the phenotype, and the phenotype was lost when the same cells were cultured in the presence of tetracycline to inhibit HAβ4a expression (data not shown). Also, the phenotype was specific to paclitaxel because it did not extend to another microtubule-stabilizing drug, epothilone A (Fig. 5B), even though the two drugs share the same binding site and mechanism of action (26Bollag D.M.

Bacteria produce a variety of glycoconjugates. The diversity in their structures is afforded by an unparalleled range of glycosyltransferase enzymes that transfer sugars from activated donor substrates to acceptor substrates. Bacterial enzymes have provided some influential models to assess glycosyltransferase structure and function because of the relative ease of their manipulation. One source of glycosyltransferase diversity is lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 2The abbreviations used are:LPSlipopolysaccharideCAZycarbohydrateactive enzymescore OScore oligosaccharideKdo3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acidUDP-Glcuridine-5′-diphosphoglucoseGalgalactoseGlcglucoseGlcNAcN-acetylglucosamineGlcNglucosamineEtNethanolamineAmpampicillinGmgentamycinCEcapillary electrophoresisMSmass spectrometryNMRnuclear magnetic resonanceKDN2-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nononic acid assembly, and the focus of this study are the enzymes involved in biosynthesis of the core oligosaccharide region (core OS). The outer leaflet of the Gram-negative outer membrane contains LPS as a major component. LPS is comprised of three structural domains: lipid A, core OS, and O antigen (1Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3422) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli isolates produce one of five core OS types: K-12, R1, R2, R3, and R4 (reviewed in Ref. 2Amor K.

Immun. 2000; 68: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and there are at least two core OS types in Salmonella isolates (3Kaniuk N.A. Monteiro M.A. Parker C.T. Whitfield C. Mol.

The backbone of the inner (lipid A proximal) core OS is typically conserved, and the various core types primarily arise from differences in inner core substitution and the structure of the part of the outer core, which provides the attachment site for O antigen. The genetic basis for these differences has been described (3Kaniuk N.A. Monteiro M.A. Parker C.T. Whitfield C. Mol.

Even when candidate genes have been identified, their DNA sequences alone cannot predict which donor or acceptor substrates will be used by the glycosyltransferase. Experiments involving in vivo complementation of chromosomal insertion mutants and subsequent PAGE analysis of LPS patterns do not necessarily directly address which gene product is producing the LPS alteration, nor do they identify the donor substrate used (5Kadam S.K.

Bacterial core OS biosynthesis requires the concerted action of specific glycosyltransferase enzymes. The outer core OS biosynthesis glycosyltransferases in E. coli provide an interesting collection of related (predicted) enzymes to examine principles of substrate (UDP-sugar) and linkage specificity (Fig. 1). WaaJ catalyzes the addition of an α-1,2-linked Glc to the outer core OS in R3 E. coli (7Kaniuk N.A. Vinogradov E. Li J. Monteiro M.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31237-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (5Kadam S.K. Rehemtulla A. Sanderson K.E. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 277-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the kinetic properties of the E. coli enzyme have been investigated (6Leipold M.D. Kaniuk N.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1257-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The related WaaT enzyme adds an α-1,2-linked Gal to the outer core OS in R1 and R4 E. coli (8Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Amor P.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29497-29505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas WaaR is required for the addition of an α-1,2-glucose to the outer core OS in K-12 and R2 E. coli (8Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Amor P.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29497-29505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). While WaaJ, WaaR, and WaaT all belong to glycosyltransferase CAZy family 8 and catalyze the same α-1,2 linkage of the donor sugar to their lipid-linked acceptors, they utilize different UDP-sugar donor substrates and have different terminal sugars on their acceptor LPS. However the predicted activities for WaaR and WaaT have not been examined directly. Here we examine the donor and acceptor specificity of these glycosyltransferases enzymes in a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to generate a better understanding of their substrate specificities and the potential for their manipulation in glycoengineering. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The prototypes for the R1, R2, and R3 core OSs are E. coli F470, F632, and F653 respectively; all are rough mutants, i.e. lacking O antigen (9Schmidt G. Fromme I. Mayer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CWG350 (waaJ:aacC1) is a derivative of F653 (7Kaniuk N.A. Vinogradov E. Li J. Monteiro M.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31237-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CWG309 (waaT: aacC1) and CWG308 (waaO:aacC1) are derivatives of F470 (8Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Amor P.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29497-29505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These mutants have been described previously and are marked by the gentamycin-resistance cassette (aacC1).

Plasmid pWQ272 is a pBAD18-derivative (10Guzman L-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3976) Google Scholar) containing the coding sequence for an N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged His6-WaaJ fusion protein and was previously reported (6Leipold M.D. Kaniuk N.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1257-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Plasmid pWQ269 is a derivative of pBAD18 engineered to contain a plasmid-encoded ribosome binding site and N-terminal His6-tag 5′ of the multicloning site in an organization identical to pWQ272 (supplemental Table S1). The waaR and waaT genes were amplified by PCR and cloned into pWQ269. Plasmid pWQ270 contains the coding sequence for His6-WaaR amplified from E. coli F632 genomic DNA (purified using the InstaGene kit, Bio-Rad), while pWQ271 contains the coding sequence for His6-WaaT from pWQ905 (8Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Amor P.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29497-29505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma Genosys and are listed in supplemental Table S1. The sequences of all of the constructs were confirmed to be error-free by sequencing at the Guelph Molecular Supercenter (University of Guelph). Complementation Experiments to Assess in Vivo Activity of His6-Waa* Derivatives—Function of the various glycosyltransferases was established by electrotransformation of E. coli CWG350 (waaJ:aacC1), CWG309 (waaT:aacC1), and CWG308 (waaO:aacC1) with plasmids encoding the appropriate Waa* glycosyltransferase. Cultures of transformed bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 0.1-ml aliquots were then used to inoculate 5-ml cultures of the same medium supplemented with 0.02% l-arabinose to induce expression from the pBAD promoter in pBAD18 (10Guzman L-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3976) Google Scholar). After growth at 37 °C for 5 h, SDS-proteinase K whole cell lysate samples were made following the procedure of Hitchcock and Brown (11Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS molecular species in these samples were then separated by electrophoresis using 4–12% gradient NuPage gels (Invitrogen). Electrophoresis was carried out at 150 V for 75 min. The gels were silver-stained using standard methods (12Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). The extent of complementation was determined by scanning the gels using a Bio-Rad GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer and determining the relative amounts of the two major bands with QuantityOne software. Production and Purification of LPS and Core Oligosaccharides—The LPS (3453 g/mol calculated molecular weight CWG350 LPS; 3368 g/mol calculated molecular weight CWG309 LPS) was purified from F653, CWG350, CWG309, CWG350 (pWQ271), CWG350 (pWQ270), and CWG309 (pWQ272). The LPS was extracted from cells harvested from 6-liter cultures and isolated by phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether method (13Galanos C. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), as previously described (7Kaniuk N.A. Vinogradov E. Li J. Monteiro M.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31237-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The isolated LPS was frozen and lyophilized. Working stocks for in vitro assays were stored as 2 mg/ml or 5 mg/ml aqueous solutions at –20 °C. Lipid A was removed by treating LPS (100 mg) in 5 ml of 2% AcOH at 100 °C for 3 h. Lipid A was removed as a precipitate by centrifugation, and soluble products were separated on a Sephadex G-50 column (2.5 × 95 cm) eluted in pyridinium/acetate buffer, pH 4.5 (4 ml of pyridine and 10 ml of AcOH in 1 liter of water). The eluate was monitored using a refractive index detector. The samples were then filtered through a SepPak C18 column (Waters) in water. Anion-exchange chromatography was performed on a 5-ml Hitrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) in water for 10 min, then in a linear gradient of 0 to 1 M NaCl over 60 min with UV detection at 220 nm. To obtain a cleaner NMR spectrum, core oligosaccharide from CWG309 (pWQ272) (5 mg) was dephosphorylated by 48% aqueous hydrofluoric acid (0.1 ml) for 20 h at 4 °C. The HF was removed under a stream of nitrogen, and the product was then desalted by gel chromatography on a Sephadex G-15 column (1.6 × 80 cm) column using the pyridinium acetate buffer, pH 4.5 (4 ml of pyridine and 10 ml of AcOH in 1 liter of water) as eluant. The eluant was monitored by a refractive index detector and collected fractions were then lyophilized before use. Compositional and Methylation Analysis—For compositional analysis, oligosaccharides were hydrolyzed in 4 m CF3CO2H (120 °C, 3 h), and monosaccharides were converted into the alditol acetate derivatives. The products were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography (GC) on an Agilent 6850 chromatograph equipped with DB-17 (30 m × 0.25 mm) fused-silica column using a temperature gradient of 180 °C (2 min) to 240 °C at 2 °C/min. Methylation analysis was performed using Ciucanu-Kerek procedure (14Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). Methylated products were hydrolyzed, and the monosaccharides were converted to 1d-alditol acetates by conventional methods and analyzed by GC-MS. GC-MS was performed on Varian Saturn 2000 system equipped with an ion-trap mass spectral detector using the same column. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C in D2O on a Varian UNITY INOVA 600 instrument using acetone as reference (1H, 2.225 ppm and 13C, 31.45 ppm). Varian standard programs COSY, NOESY (mixing time of 300 ms), TOCSY (spinlock time 120 ms), HSQC, and gHMBC (evolution delay of 100 ms) were used with digital resolution in F2 dimension <2 Hz/point for proton-proton correlations. Spectra were assigned using the computer program Pronto. The chemical shift data is presented in supplemental Table S2 according to the labeling scheme in supplemental Fig. S1. Mass Spectrometry—CE-MS spectra were acquired using a 4000 QTrap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/Sciex, Concord, ON, Canada) with CE injection system (Prince Technologies, Netherlands). CE separation was obtained on a 90-cm length of bare fused-silica capillary (365 μm OD × 50 μm ID) with CE-MS coupling using a liquid sheath-flow interface and isopropyl alcohol:methanol (2:1) as the sheath liquid. An aqueous buffer consisting of 30 mm morpholine was used for all experiments in the negative-ion mode. The MS data are presented in supplemental Table S3. Overexpression, Localization, and Purification of Waa* Proteins—Overexpression and cellular location of the His6-WaaT and His6-WaaR enzymes was monitored by Western immunoblotting, essentially as described previously for His6-WaaJ (6Leipold M.D. Kaniuk N.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1257-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cell-free lysates of E. coli CWG309 containing pWQ271 and E. coli TOP10 containing pWQ270 were separated by ultracentrifugation. The soluble fraction was collected and the membrane pellet was washed twice with 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The fraction volumes were adjusted to facilitate direct comparison of the amount of membrane protein corresponding to a given amount of soluble protein. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The Western immunoblots were developed using HisProbe H3 mouse anti-His6 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., Montréal, QB). Nitro blue tetrazolium from Sigma and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate from Roche were used as substrates to develop the Western blots. The bands were quantified by densitometry using a Bio-Rad GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer with QuantityOne software. The purification of His6-WaaJ from overexpression in E. coli TOP10 cells has been described elsewhere (6Leipold M.D. Kaniuk N.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1257-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Purification of His6-WaaT was done in a similar fashion using Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography, except batch binding was done directly using cell-free lysate, without prior removal of membrane material. In addition, 150 mm NaCl and 7.5 mm imidazole were included in the lysis buffer during sonication and in initial washing of the affinity column. The purified proteins were dispensed in 0.2-ml aliquots for single use, and total protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. His6-WaaJ and His6-WaaT were stable in this form at 4 °C for periods of up to 2 weeks. Storage at –20 °C offered no additional stability and enzyme samples thawed after storage at –80 °C showed significant loss of activity. It should be noted that the level of overexpression of His6-WaaT was lower than His6-WaaJ. Yields of purified protein were also compromised by the tendency of His6-WaaT to adsorb to filters used in concentration. In Vitro Determination of the Activity of His6-Waa* Enzymes—The activity of the various constructs was determined as previously described (6Leipold M.D. Kaniuk N.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1257-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The reaction is based on the transfer of radioactivity from [14C-Glc]UDP (Perkin Elmer, 200.0 mCi/mmol) or [14C-Gal]UDP (Perkin Elmer, 258.0 mCi/mmol) donor to an acceptor comprising the LPS isolated from E. coli CWG350 (waaJ:aacC1) or CWG309 (waaT:aacC1). Final reaction conditions after the addition of enzyme were: 1–750 μm UDP-sugar donor, 2–750 μm LPS, 100 mm Tris pH 7.5, 0.4 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 200–900 nm His6-WaaJ or His6-WaaT in a final volume of 0.1 ml. The His6-WaaJ or His6-WaaT concentration was adjusted to ensure that it was always at least 5-fold below the lowest substrate concentration. The rates at each substrate concentration were then fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine kcat and Km. These values should be considered as “apparent” because of the stopped nature of the assay. Comparison of WaaJ, WaaR, and WaaT Sequences—Previous work from our laboratory established the in vivo and in vitro properties of WT WaaJ (6Leipold M.D. Kaniuk N.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1257-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The purpose of this work is to expand that analysis to other CAZy family 8 glycosyltransferases involved in E. coli LPS biosynthesis, particularly ones employing alternate donor sugars and terminal acceptor linkages. As might be anticipated for E. coli LPS core oligosaccharide biosynthesis proteins that all belong to glycosyltransferase family 8, WaaJ, WaaR, and WaaT share significant primary sequence identity (∼40%) and similarity (∼60%) and several highly conserved regions (supplemental Fig. S2). The sequences of these proteins predict no transmembrane helices. However, their nascent lipid A-core OS acceptor is membrane-associated, indicating that a membrane association might be beneficial for activity. His6-WaaT was found to be 75% membrane-associated, and His6-WaaR was found to be 64% membrane-associated (data not shown), compared with 55% for His6-WaaJ (6Leipold M.D. Kaniuk N.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1257-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As described for WaaJ (6Leipold M.D. Kaniuk N.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1257-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the WaaT and WaaR sequences could be threaded onto the LgtC crystal structure with good alignment of secondary structure (data not shown), but the difference in primary sequences limited the usefulness of this information and precluded any meaningful prediction of residues that might dictate specificity. Function of His6-Waa* Derivatives in Vivo—To investigate whether His6-WaaT, His6-WaaJ, and His6-WaaR could function to extend waaJ:aacC1 or waaT:aacC1 LPS in vivo, plasmids encoding the relevant protein were transformed into CWG350 (waaJ:aacC1) and CWG309 (waaT:aacC1) and the resulting LPS profile was investigated by silver-stained PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2, WaaR was able to extend the LPS acceptor from CWG350 (waaJ:aacC1) to generate a product that comigrated with the wild-type LPS, despite the fact that the native acceptor residue for WaaR is a 1,3-linked Glc, rather than the 1,3-linked Gal provided by CWG350 LPS. The CWG350 LPS acceptor lacks three hexose residues (see below) compared with the wild type and migrates significantly faster, thus WaaR is able to form a product that can then be further extended by additional glycosyltransferases. WaaT was also able to extend the 1,3-linked Gal acceptor but the product remained smaller than the wild type; its migration was consistent with the absence of a single residue. Each of the glycosyltransferases was able to extend the 1,3-linked Glc acceptor provided by CWG309 (waaT:aacC1) LPS to restore a wild-type profile, indicating that WaaW (Fig. 1) could utilize their products to add the final core OS residue in the F470 (R1 core OS) background. To further probe the acceptor specificities, each of these enzymes were expressed in CWG308 (waaO:aacC1) cells. Interestingly, no core OS extension occurred in this mutant (Fig. 2C). Despite the observation (above), indicating that WaaJ, WaaR, and WaaT did not discriminate between 1,3-linked Gal or 1,3-linked Glc acceptors, the enzymes are apparently sensitive to the position of the acceptor residue in the context of the core OS structure. While silver-stained PAGE LPS profiling is a facile method to test the ability of a protein to extend a given LPS, it does not give any information about the identity of the sugars added. To identify the sugars added in the above LPS extensions, LPS was isolated from CWG350, CWG350 (pWQ271), CWG350 (pWQ270), CWG350 (pWQ272), and CWG309 (pWQ272). The structures of the LPS molecules were determined by NMR and MS methods (supplemental Tables S2 and S3). The resulting structures are shown graphically in Fig. 3. The CWG350 LPS contains a Gal-(1, 2)-Glc outer core and lacks the 2 terminal residues expected from the waaJ mutation (Fig. 1). Also missing is the side-chain GlcNAc residue. This result was consistent with the PAGE profile with respect to the size of the products but differs from the CWG350 structure obtained previously, where traces of GlcNAc were reported (7Kaniuk N.A. Vinogradov E. Li J. Monteiro M.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31237-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The NMR analysis of the CWG350 core OS was repeated and no evidence of the GlcNAc residue could be detected; there was no detectable peak corresponding to an N-acetyl group. Moreover, the MS data also reflected a core OS species lacking GlcNAc. The reason for this disparity between the structures of CWG350 is unknown and the results shown below indicate that the currently unidentified transferase required for GlcNAc addition (7Kaniuk N.A. Vinogradov E. Li J. Monteiro M.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31237-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) is still active in the strains used here. In CWG350 cells expressing either WaaR or WaaJ, the authentic LPS structure was restored. WaaR is normally a UDP-glucose:(glucosyl) LPS α-1,2-glucosyltransferase. However, when active in the context of CWG350, it shows UDP-glucose: (galactosyl) LPS α-1,2-glucosyltransferase activity. As expected, the LPS molecule resulting from WaaR or WaaJ activity serves as an acceptor for WaaD and the still unidentified GlcNAc transferase to complete the core OS structure. In contrast, WaaT added only a single residue to CWG350 LPS. While WaaT is a UDP-galactose:(glucosyl) LPS α-1,2-galactosyltransferase in its wildtype background, in CWG350 it exhibits UDP-galactose:(galactosyl) LPS α-1,2-galactosyltransferase activity. It therefore retains its normal donor specificity but can effectively utilize a different acceptor. The resulting product is not further extended by either WaaD or the GlcNAc transferase, indicating that these transferases are either sensitive to perturbations in acceptor structure, or lose critical protein-protein interactions when the precise combination of glycosyltransferase enzymes changes. CWG309 cells expressing WaaJ were able to form a complete core OS. However, Glc was incorporated as the second-to-last hexose in the core OS backbone. WaaJ is normally a UDP-glucose:(galactosyl) LPS α-1,2-glucosyltransferase. Thus, in the CWG309 background, WaaJ shows UDP-glucose:(glucosyl) LPS α-1,2-glucosyltransferase activity. This demonstrates that, like WaaT and WaaR, it also retains its normal donor specificity in a heterologous background. The published structure for CWG309 core OS lacks the β-Glc sidechain, suggesting this residue is added late in the assembly process (8Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Amor P.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29497-29505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The full extension of the CWG309 (pWQ272) LPS product implies that WaaV and WaaW are unaffected by the local changes in their acceptor structure. This differs from the situation described above for WaaD acting in CWG350 (Fig. 1). In Vitro Kinetic Behavior of His6-WaaJ and His6-WaaT Proteins—The in vivo results demonstrate two basic principles: (i) His6-WaaT, His6-WaaR, and His6-WaaJ have a marked preference for their specific donor substrates; (ii) these enzymes appear to have a relaxed specificity for alternate LPS acceptor residues, providing the overall size of the acceptor is conserved. His6-WaaJ and His6-WaaT were therefore selected for in vitro analysis to more precisely determine the effect of alternate donor and acceptor substrates on their kinetic properties. Those results are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for His6-WaaJ and His6-WaaT glycosyltransferasesProteinAcceptor LPSDonorkcataData were calculated as the average and propagated error of the kcat values as determined from the acceptor and donor Michaelis-Menten fits.Km(LPS)bValues were determined at saturating concentrations of UDP-sugar donor (150 μm).Km(donor)cValues were determined at saturating concentrations of LPS acceptor (150 μm).min-1μmμmWaaJCWG350 (waaJ::aacC1)UDP-Glc28 ± 4dValues reproduced from Ref. 6.11 ± 3dValues reproduced from Ref. 6.32 ± 8dValues reproduced from Ref. 6.CWG350 (waaJ::aacC1)UDP-Gal4.1 ± 0.327 ± 7200 ± 30CWG309 (waaT::aacC1)UDP-Glc8.2 ± 0.535 ± 340 ± 5WaaTCWG350 (waaJ::aacC1)UDP-Gal3.7 ± 0.525 ± 836 ± 9CWG309 (waaT::aacC1)UDP-Gal4.6 ± 0.237 ± 342 ± 7CWG309 (waaT::aacC1)UDP-GlcNDeLimitations of protein concentration and reduced catalytic activity prevented full characterization.

https://openalex.org/W2010936295,"Id2, a negative regulator of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, is involved in regulating cell differentiation and proliferation. To obtain insight into the role of Id2 in cell cycle control, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the immediate early response of Id2 expression to serum stimulation in NIH3T3 cells. Luciferase reporter analysis with deletion and point mutants demonstrated the serum response element of Id2 (Id2-SRE) to be a consensus binding site for RFX1 (regulatory factor for X-box 1) present 3.0 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site of Id2. Gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the binding of RFX1 to Id2-SRE in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In both assays, RFX1 binding was observed not only in serum-stimulated cells, but also in serum-starved cells. Knockdown of RFX1 by RNA interference disturbed the immediate early response of Id2 expression in cells and abrogated the Id2-SRE-mediated induction of luciferase activity by serum. These alterations were rescued by the introduction of RNA interference-resistant RFX1 into cells. On the other hand, in the Id2-SRE-mediated reporter assay, RFX1 with an N-terminal deletion abrogated the serum response, whereas RFX1 with a C-terminal deletion enhanced the reporter activity in serum-starved cells. Furthermore, HDAC1 was recruited to Id2-SRE in serum-starved cells. These results demonstrate that RFX1 mediates the immediate early response of the Id2 gene by serum stimulation and suggest that the function of RFX1 is regulated intramolecularly in its suppression in growth-arrested cells.

In addition, overexpression of Id genes and/or proteins has been reported in various human malignancies (1Ruzinova M.B. Benezra R.

In growth-arrested fibroblasts, in which Id mRNAs are barely detectable, mitogenic stimulation rapidly induces expression of Id genes (3Hara E. Yamaguchi T. Nojima H. Ide T. Campisi J. Okayama H.

It has been reported that Id2 and Id3 are categorized into a group to which c-myc belongs in terms of the kinetics of mRNA expression in human fibroblasts induced by serum stimulation (8Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T. Lee J.C. Trent J.M. Staudt L.M. Jr. Hudson J. Boguski M.S. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). In fact, Id3 was identified as an immediate early gene by differential screening (6Christy B.A. Sanders L.K. Lau L.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1815-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms underlying Id gene induction upon mitogenic stimulation remain unclear, although Egr-1 (early growth response 1), an immediate early gene, has been shown to regulate the expression of Id1 (9Tournay O. Benezra R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 2418-2430Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and Id3 (10Bain G. Cravatt C.B. Loomans C. Alberola-Ila J. Hedrick S.M. Murre C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Immediate early genes are those rapidly induced by growth stimulation without de novo protein synthesis (11Lau L.F. Nathans D.

Biol. 1998; 58: 41-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because many of them encode transcriptional regulators or secreted signaling molecules, they are thought to be involved in gene activation cascades required for the progression of the cell cycle (13Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A. Lander E.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 727-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the induction pathways of immediate early genes can advance our understandings of how cell proliferation is controlled and how tumors develop. Immediate early genes are subclassified into genes with fast and slow kinetics of induction after mitogenic stimulation (12Winkles J.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 41-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Examples of immediate early genes with fast and slow kinetics are c-fos and c-myc, respectively: c-fos mRNA exhibits its peak of expression at ∼0.5–1 h after growth stimulation and returns to the base line within 2 h (14Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar), whereas c-myc expression peaks at ∼1–3 h after stimulation (15Kelly K. Cochran B.H. Stiles C.D. Leder P. Cell. 1983; 35: 603-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Various transcription factors are known to be critical for inducing the expression of immediate early genes after mitogenic stimulation. Examples include the serum response factor and ternary complex factors such as Elk-1 (16Posern G. Treisman R. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 588-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Although the induction mechanisms of several immediate early genes have been extensively studied, numerous immediate early genes have been reported, and the mechanisms of their transcriptional regulation largely remain to be determined. Here we report that the rapid induction of Id2 gene expression in murine fibroblasts by serum stimulation is mediated by RFX1 (regulatory factor for X-box 1). RFX1 is a transcription factor involved in the induction of gene expression of viruses such as human hepatitis B virus and cytomegalovirus (17Siegrist C.A. Durand B. Emery P. David E. Hearing P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6375-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the suppression of cellular genes such as c-myc (18Reinhold W. Emens L. Itkes A. Blake M.

Our work reveals a novel molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of immediate early gene expression. Plasmids—The plasmid encoding the human RFX1 cDNA, pSG5-HARFX1, and its N- and C-terminal deletion constructs, RFX1ΔN(Δ1–415) and RFX1ΔC(Δ603–979), were provided by Dr. Y. Shaul (Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel) (20Lubelsky Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10665-10673Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Plasmids pcDNA3-FLAG-RFX1, pcDNA3-HA-RFX2, and pSG5-RFX3 were provided by Drs. A. Iwama (Chiba University, Chiba, Japan) and Z. Sun (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (21Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P.

A series of luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by inserting the appropriate genomic fragments derived from pBS-Id2-N10 (23Yokota Y. Mansouri A. Mori S. Sugawara S. Adachi S. Nishikawa S. Gruss P. Nature. 1999; 397: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) and/or pGL2-Id2/C (24Karaya K. Mori S. Kimoto H. Shima Y. Tsuji Y. Kurooka H. Akira S. Yokota Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1924-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) into pGL4.12, encoding the fast response luciferase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The restriction sites used were BamHI, PstI, and EcoRI in pBS-Id2-N10 and KpnI, BglII, and NcoI in pGL2-Id2/C and pGL4.12. If necessary, restriction fragments were subcloned after blunting. The resultant plasmids contained the mouse genomic fragments of the Id2 gene locus as follows: pGL4-Id2-1, 4596 bp, –4516 to +80; pGL4-Id2-2, 2350 bp, –2270 to +80; pGL4-Id2-3, 1120 bp, –1040 to +80; pGL4-Id2-4, 2246 bp, –4516 to –2271; pGL4-Id2-5, 780 bp, –4516 to –3737; pGL4-Id2-6, 1466 bp, –3736 to –2271; pGL4-Id2-7, 776 bp, –3736 to –2961; pGL4-Id2-8, 142 bp, –2960 to –2819; and pGL4-Id2-9, 548 bp, –2818 to –2271. The positions were numbered from the transcription initiation site of the Id2 gene. Site-specific and deletion mutants of pGL4-Id2-8 were generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis with the appropriate oligonucleotides following standard protocols, and the authenticity was confirmed by sequencing. For construction of plasmids for RNA interference against RFX1, we selected two target sites spanning nucleotides 2021–2039 and 1657–1675 in the mouse Rfx1 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number X76088) (22Reith W.

RFX1-siRNA1 was designed according a previous report (25Fan J. Zhan M. Shen J. Martindale J.L. Yang X. Kawai T. Gorospe M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1492-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Forward and reverse oligonucleotides corresponding to these sites were synthesized, annealed, and subcloned into the pSUPER.puro vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA), resulting in pSUPER.puro-RFX1-1 and pSUPER.puro-RFX1-2, respectively. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used were as follows: RFX1-siRNA1, 5′-GATCCCCGACCTTCTGGAGATACAACTTCAAGAGAGTTGTATCTCCAGAAGGTCTTTTTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCTTAAAAAGACCTTCTGGAGATACAACTCTCTTGAAGTTGTATCTCCAGAAGGTCGGG-3′ (reverse); and RFX1-siRNA2, 5′-GATCCCCGCTCACCCCTGCTGCGGCTTTCAAGAGAAGCCGCAGCAGGGGTGAGCTTTTTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCTTAAAAAGCTCACCCCTGCTGCGGCTTCTCTTGAAAGCCGCAGCAGGGGTGAGCGGG-3′ (reverse).

Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH3T3, HeLa, and TIG3 (human diploid fibroblasts; Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources, Tokyo, Japan) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; MP Biomedicals, Eschwege, Germany), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. For synchronization of the cell cycle, cells were serum-starved by culture in DMEM containing 0.2% FBS for 48 h. Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma. More than 85% of the serum-starved cells were confirmed to be in G0 or G1 phase by flow cytometry. To stimulate cells with serum, the low serum medium was changed to DMEM containing 20% FBS, and cells were maintained in this medium until used. DNA transfection was carried out using TransIT reagent (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Flow Cytometry—Cells were collected by trypsinization, fixed with 70% ethanol at –20 °C for 1 h, and incubated with 25 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml RNase in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min. The cells were then analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) with ModFit LT3 software. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Five micrograms of total RNA were separated by electrophoresis on a formaldehyde-containing 1.0% agarose gel, transferred onto a nylon filter, and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Radioactive DNA probes for Id2,c-myc, and Rfx1 and 36B4 rRNA were prepared by random primer labeling of the respective cDNAs with [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridization and washing were performed according to standard procedures. Hybridized filters were exposed to a BAS-2000 imaging plate (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) to quantify the radioactivity. 36B4 rRNA served as a loading control. Luciferase Reporter Assay—NIH3T3 cells were plated in a 24-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were transfected with reporter plasmids for 4 h, and serum starvation was started by changing the medium to 0.2% FBS-containing DMEM. After serum starvation for 48 h, cells were stimulated with serum by changing the low serum medium to 20% FBS-containing DMEM. Before and 4 h after serum stimulation, cell lysates were prepared, and their luciferase activities were measured as described previously (26Narumi O. Mori S. Boku S. Tsuji Y. Hashimoto N. Nishikawa S. Yokota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3510-3521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions with a Luminescencer PSN (Atto Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The Renilla luciferase plasmid pRL-TK (Promega Corp.) was cotransfected as an internal control. The magnitude of the serum response was determined by calculating the -fold induction of luciferase activity before and 4 h after serum stimulation. Assays were independently carried out at least three times in triplicate. The coefficients of variation (defined as the ratio of the S.D. to the mean) of luciferase activities in arrested cells were <0.3, indicating that the luciferase activities in arrested cells were accurately and reproducibly measured. Data Analysis—Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed using either Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Preparation of nuclear extracts of NIH3T3 cells and EMSA were done as described previously (24Karaya K. Mori S. Kimoto H. Shima Y. Tsuji Y. Kurooka H. Akira S. Yokota Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1924-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The protein content was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Five micrograms of nuclear extracts were incubated with 20000 cpm of [α-32P]dCTP-labeled oligonucleotides in 20 μl of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (21Iwama A. Pan J. Zhang P. Reith W. Mach B. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at room temperature for 30 min and then separated on a 6.0% polyacrylamide gel. After drying, the gel was exposed to x-ray film or a BAS-2000 imaging plate. The sequences of the oligonucleotides containing the consensus RFX1-binding site were as follows: wild-type Id2, 5′-GTGACGGCGCGGTTGCTATGGCAGCCG-3′; mutant Id2, 5′-GTGACGGCGCGGTTGCTGGTGCAGCCG-3′; and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II HLA-DR (20Lubelsky Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10665-10673Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), 5′-GATCCTTCCCCTAGCAACAGATA-3′. A 200-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction as an unlabeled competitor. For the supershift assay, 2 μg of anti-RFX1 (I-19), anti-RFX2 (C-15), or anti-RFX3 (T-17) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-RFX5 antibody (193 or 194; Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc., Gilbertsville, PA) were added to the reaction mixture. In vitro translation of the human RFX1 protein was done using pSG5-HARFX1 (20Lubelsky Y. Reuven N. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10665-10673Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the TnT protein expression system (Promega Corp.), and 1% of the product was used for the binding reaction. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Total cell extracts were prepared by incubating cells in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuging at 17,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C as described (27Kurooka H. Yokota Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4313-4320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fifty micrograms of proteins were separated by 8 or 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were blotted with anti-RFX1 or anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibody. Protein blots were visualized using the ECL Plus chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare) on an LAS-3000 image analyzer (Fujifilm). For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of whole cell lysates were incubated with anti-HDAC1 (histone deacetylase-1) antibody (H-51; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-RFX1 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with protein Aor G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 3 h with rotation. The precipitated immunocomplex was released by boiling in 2× SDS electrophoresis sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was done as described previously (24Karaya K. Mori S. Kimoto H. Shima Y. Tsuji Y. Kurooka H. Akira S. Yokota Y.

Med. 2003; 198: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In brief, NIH3T3 cells were cross-linked with 1.0% formaldehyde in the medium for 2 min at 37 °C, rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 1.0 ml of SDS lysis buffer (28Gonda H. Sugai M. Nambu Y. Katakai T. Agata Y. Mori K.J. Yokota Y. Shimizu A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were then sonicated with a Bioruptor (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and the sonicated lysates were precleared as described (24Karaya K. Mori S. Kimoto H. Shima Y. Tsuji Y. Kurooka H. Akira S. Yokota Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1924-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Gonda H. Sugai M. Nambu Y. Katakai T. Agata Y. Mori K.J. Yokota Y. Shimizu A. J. Exp.

Immunoprecipitation was performed with 5 μg of anti-RFX1, anti-HDAC1, or anti-CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBPβ) polyclonal (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. Normal rabbit IgG (Sigma) served as a negative control. Immunocomplexes were then mixed with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h and washed sequentially with low salt buffer, high salt buffer, LiCl wash buffer (28Gonda H. Sugai M. Nambu Y. Katakai T. Agata Y. Mori K.J. Yokota Y. Shimizu A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and TE (Tris/EDTA) buffer. Immunocomplexes were eluted with elution buffer, and reversal of cross-linking and purification of DNA were done as described (28Gonda H. Sugai M. Nambu Y. Katakai T. Agata Y. Mori K.J. Yokota Y. Shimizu A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Precipitated DNA was resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer for input DNA and 20 μl of TE buffer for ChIP DNA. The DNA fragments obtained were analyzed by PCR using the following primer pair: Id2, 5′-CTTTTGCTTTGGCAAGGTCT-3′ or 5′-CTTGCAGGCATTGATCAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCTGCAGCCTTGTCCTC-3′ (reverse). The ChIP assay of C/EBPβ was performed as described previously (24Karaya K. Mori S. Kimoto H. Shima Y. Tsuji Y. Kurooka H. Akira S. Yokota Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1924-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and used as a positive as well as a negative control. Quantitative real-time PCR for ChIP was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Ohtsu, Japan) on an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). RNA Interference—RNA interference was carried out by introducing pSUPER.puro-RFX1-1 or pSUPER. puro-RFX1-2 into NIH3T3 cells. In Northern and Western blot analyses, an siRNA-expressing cell population was enriched by culturing transfectants with 5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for 2 days. NIH3T3 cells constitutively expressing RFX1-siRNA1 or RFX1-siRNA2 were established by puromycin selection for 7 days after transfection with pSUPER.puro-RFX1-1 or pSUPER. puro-RFX1-2, respectively, and maintained with the drug. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, stained with anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody 16B12 (CRP Inc., Denver, PA) and then with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), and mounted with a mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The cells were observed with an Olympus inverted fluorescence microscope. Id2 Is an Immediate Early Response Gene—We examined Id2 gene expression in a murine fibroblast cell line (NIH3T3) during cell cycle progression. To obtain a synchronized cell population, NIH3T3 cells were serum-starved with 0.2% FBS-containing DMEM for 48 h and then stimulated with 20% FBS-containing DMEM. RNA was prepared before and after the stimulation and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Id2 mRNA was undetectable in a growth-arrested state and was induced as early as 30 min after serum stimulation (Fig. 1A) as reported previously (7Barone M.V. Pepperkok R. Peverali F.A. Philipson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4985-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Id2 mRNA was induced in a biphasic pattern with peaks at 4 and 14–16 h after serum stimulation, similar to Id2 expression at the mRNA level in human primary cultured fibroblasts (8Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T. Lee J.C. Trent J.M. Staudt L.M. Jr. Hudson J. Boguski M.S. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar) and in human diploid fibroblast TIG3 cells (3Hara E. Yamaguchi T. Nojima H. Ide T. Campisi J. Okayama H. Oda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2139-2145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether serum-induced Id2 expression depends on de novo protein synthesis, we treated NIH3T3 cells with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, and analyzed Id2 mRNA expression after serum stimulation by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, cycloheximide did not interfere with serum-induced Id2 mRNA expression and rather augmented it at 30 min after serum stimulation. Similar results were obtained with TIG3 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that Id2 is one of the immediate early genes that are rapidly induced in response to growth stimulation without de novo protein synthesis. Induction of Id2 Gene Expression by Serum Is Dependent on RFX1—To explore the molecular basis of the immediate early response of Id2 to serum stimulation, we tried to identify the genomic region that confers the serum response using a luciferase reporter assay. To this end, the upstream genomic fragment of the mouse Id2 gene was subcloned into the pGL4.12 reporter plasmid, which encodes a degradation-prone luciferase protein, enabling us to trace a rapid change in reporter activity. After transfection of the reporter plasmid pGL4-Id2-1, into NIH3T3 cells, the cells were serum-deprived with 0.2% FBS-containing DMEM for 48 h and then stimulated with 20% FBS-containing DMEM for 4 h. The extent of serum-induced transcription was evaluated by calculating the -fold induction of the luciferase activity before and after serum stimulation (luciferase activity at 4 h/luciferase activity at 0 h). As shown in Fig. 2A, the 4.6-kb DNA fragment upstream of the Id2 gene exhibited an ability to induce 5.5-fold induction of the luciferase activity, suggesting that this region contains an element responsive to serum. We then constructed a series of deletion mutants of this genomic region and analyzed their reporter activities. As a result, a 142-bp region flanked by PstI sites, located 3.0 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site of mouse Id2, was found to be sufficient to induce the serum response (pGL4-Id2-8 in Fig. 2A), although a minor contribution of the proximal 2350-bp region was also noted. The 142-bp serum-responsive region contains potential binding sites for a basic helix-loop-helix factor, cAMP response element-binding protein, cut-like homeodomain protein, NF-E2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2), RFX1 and p53 and is highly conserved between humans and mice (Fig. 2B). To specify which transcription factor is involved in the serum response of Id2, we introduced site-directed mutations into each potential binding site in the region and measured the resultant reporter activities before and after serum stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2C, the reporter bearing a mutation in the potential binding site for RFX1 displayed virtually no serum response, in contrast to the lack of a drastic alteration in the serum response with the mutants of the other consensus binding sites, although a slight reduction was observed in the mutants of E-box 2 and of the potential binding sites of NF-E2 and p53. In accordance with this, deletion of the RFX1 site led to loss of the serum response of the 142-bp region (Fig. 2C). Thus, the luciferase reporter assay identified the serum response element of Id2 (Id2-SRE) to be the potential binding site for RFX1. RFX1 Binds Id2-SRE in Vitro and in Vivo—We next performed EMSA to investigate whether RFX1 binds directly to Id2-SRE using an oligonucleotide containing Id2-SRE.

In this study, we describe the application of direct (i.e. no exogenous cross-linking reagents) laser UV cross-linking as a universal non-perturbing approach for studying the characteristics of T4Dam binding with substrates in the equilibrium and transient modes of interaction. UV irradiation of the enzyme·substrate complexes using an Nd3+:yttrium aluminum garnet laser at 266 nm resulted in up to 3 and >15% yields of direct T4Dam cross-linking to DNA and AdoMet, respectively. Consequently, we were able to measure equilibrium constants and dissociation rates for enzyme·substrate complexes. In particular, we demonstrate that both reaction substrates, specific DNA and AdoMet (or product AdoHcy), stabilized the ternary complex. The improved substrate affinity for the enzyme in the ternary complex significantly reduced dissociation rates (up to 2 orders of magnitude). Several of the parameters obtained (such as dissociation rate constants for the binary T4Dam·AdoMet complex and for enzyme complexes with a nonfluorescent hemimethylated DNA duplex) were previously inaccessible by other means. However, where possible, the results of laser UV cross-linking were compared with those of fluorescence analysis. Our study suggests that rapid laser UV cross-linking efficiently complements standard DNA methyltransferase-related tools and is a method of choice to probe enzyme-substrate interactions in cases in which data cannot be acquired by other means.

The important epigenetic process of DNA methylation has been found in members of virtually every major biological group, from viruses to mammals. This reaction is carried out by DNA methyltransferases (MTases), 3The abbreviations used are: MTaseDNA methyltransferaseAdoMetS-adenosyl-l-methionineAdoHcyS-adenosyl-l-homocysteineT4Dambacteriophage T4-encoded Dam DNA (adenine-N6)-methyltransferase.3The abbreviations used are: MTaseDNA methyltransferaseAdoMetS-adenosyl-l-methionineAdoHcyS-adenosyl-l-homocysteineT4Dambacteriophage T4-encoded Dam DNA (adenine-N6)-methyltransferase. which catalyze methyl group transfer from the donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), producing S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) and methylated cytosine or adenine bases within specific recognition sites. The common role of MTases in prokaryotes and their phages is to protect DNA from the cell's own restriction enzymes. However, some MTases are known to act as regulators of gene expression and affect other critical functions (1Jeltsch A. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bheemanaik S. Reddy Y.V. Rao D.N. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The most widespread among the latter are the homologous Dam MTases, which methylate an exocyclic N6-amino group of adenine in palindromic 5′-GATC sites (3Barras F. Marinus M.G. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It should be noted that Dam methylation interferes with the coordinated expression of virulence factors in an increasing number of pathogenic bacterial species, including the Yersinia and Vibrio genera (4Casadesus J. Low D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 830-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Consequently, a detailed physical-chemical and structural characterization of Dam enzymes is clearly of great importance because it could spur development of a new class of antibiotics based on their ability to regulate Dam activity (5Mashhoon N. Pruss C. Carroll M. Johnson P.H. Reich N.O. J. Biomol. Screen. 2006; 11: 497-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

DNA methyltransferase S-adenosyl-l-methionine S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine bacteriophage T4-encoded Dam DNA (adenine-N6)-methyltransferase. The subject of this study is the bacteriophage T4-encoded Dam DNA (adenine-N6)-methyltransferase (T4Dam) (6Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 22: 139-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Hattman S. Malygin E.G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 77: 67-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which belongs to a large family of homologous Dam enzymes. Amino acid sequence homology between proteins may indicate that a considerable degree of similarity exists in their ternary structures and in their mechanisms of action. Taking into account the array of available x-ray structural data, including a binary enzyme·AdoHcy complex and six structures of enzyme·DNA complexes in non-, semi-, and fully specific modes of their interaction along the DNA recognition pathway (8Yang Z.

Hattman S. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Cell. 2005; 121: 349-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), T4Dam provides an excellent model system. During an earlier physical-chemical study of this enzyme, we applied conventional electrophoretic mobility shift and 2-aminopurine-based binding assays as well as steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic assays to characterize T4Dam-catalyzed methylation using a wide range of oligodeoxynucleotide substrate duplexes (10Malygin E.G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50012-50018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In particular, our observations indicated that AdoMet has a function in addition to its serving as the methyl donor, viz. T4Dam alone binds randomly to a hemimethylated palindromic site, whereas the addition of AdoMet induces a reorientation of the enzyme to the strand containing the unmethylated target base (13Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lind-strom Jr.W.M. Reich N.O. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2361-2369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another important observation is that methylation of DNAs having more than one specific site is affected by the enzyme's processivity (14Malygin E.G. Sclavi B. Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Hattman S. Buckle M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50012-50018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), i.e. its ability to undergo facilitated linear diffusion along the DNA and to carry out multiple turnovers on the same substrate molecule. Such a processive methylation was also shown for another homologous enzyme, the Dam MTase of Escherichia coli (15Urig S. Gowher H. Hermann A. Beck C. Fatemi M. Humeny A. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Apparently, both these mechanisms strongly increase the efficiency of methylation of hemimethylated DNA produced by in vivo replication. One of the unanswered questions regarding the mechanism of the T4Dam-catalyzed reaction concerns the dynamics of specific DNA and cofactor binding and their reciprocal influence on the affinity for the enzyme in the ternary complex. In this study, we describe the application of a direct (i.e. no exogenous cross-linking reagents) laser-mediated UV cross-linking technique as a universal non-perturbing approach to investigate the characteristics of T4Dam binding with its substrates in the equilibrium and transient modes of their interaction. For this purpose, we used both conventional equilibrium and novel time-resolved laser UV cross-linking based on the well known ability of laser UV irradiation to induce photochemical cross-linking of proteins with specific nucleic acids (16Hockensmith J.W.

Enzymes and Chemicals—The T4Dam MTase was purified to homogeneity as described (26Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214256) Google Scholar), which yielded values in close agreement with those measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm from the known composition and molar extinction coefficients of individual aromatic amino acid residues (ϵtotal = 34990 m–1 cm–1) in 6.0 m guanidine hydrochloride and 0.02 m phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) (28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). [methyl-3H]AdoMet (15 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (∼3 kCi/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. Unlabeled AdoMet (purified further by reversed-phase chromatography) (26Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), AdoHcy, and sinefungin were from Sigma. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified 20-mer oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX); the concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. The following specific substrate duplexes were obtained by annealing complementary oligodeoxynucleotide chains (where M is N6-methyladenine and N is 2-aminopurine): 5′-CAGTTTAGGATCCATTTCAC-3′ and 3′-GTCAAATCCTAGGTAAAGTG-5′ (A/A); 5′-CAGTTTAGGMTCCATTTCAC-3′ and 3′-GTCAAATCCTAGGTAAAGTG-5′ (M/A); 5′-CAGTTTAGGMTCCATTTCAC-3′ and 3′-GTCAAATCCTMGGTAAAGTG-5′ (M/M); and 5′-CAGTTTAGGMTCCATTTCAC-3′ and 3′-GTCAAATCCTNGGTAAAGTG-5′ (M/N). All experiments were carried out at 25 °C in standard T4Dam reaction buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (26Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Laser UV Cross-linking of MTase with DNA—Equilibrium T4Dam-DNA cross-linking was performed in 20 μl of T4Dam reaction buffer containing 7 nm32P-labeled specific oligodeoxynucleotide duplex, 2–60 nm T4Dam, and, in some experiments, 20 μm AdoHcy or AdoMet. Following a 5-min incubation, a single 5-ns laser pulse of 266 nm irradiation with the fourth harmonic of an Nd3+:yttrium aluminum garnet laser (DCR-3G, Spectra-Physics) was applied to the sample. An optical system consisting of two frequency-doubling crystals and a series of mirrors allowed an incident beam at 266 nm to be vertically focused on the sample placed in an uncapped 0.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The laser worked in repetitive pulsed mode, generating 10 pulses/s; single-pulse irradiation was achieved using an electromagnetic shutter. Under optimum conditions, the irradiation dose was ∼40 mJ (1017 photons)/pulse, sufficient for saturation of T4Dam-DNA adduct formation (up to 3% of the protein-DNA adduct). After irradiation, samples were diluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min to ensure protein denaturation, and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Unirradiated mixtures were used as negative controls. Gels were dried and analyzed by phosphorimaging densitometry. Quantification was carried out using ImageQuant 5.0 software (GE Healthcare). The results of densitometry were confirmed by liquid scintillation counting of 32P radioactivity in excised gel slices corresponding to the separate bands. In time-resolved dissociation experiments, a microvolume quench-flow RQF-3 instrument (KinTek Corp.) was included in the experimental setup. A 15-μl aliquot of a preformed T4Dam·[32P]DNA or T4Dam·AdoHcy·[32P]DNA complex (12 nm complex in the final 30-μl mixture) in one syringe was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of unlabeled DNA (100-fold excess) in another syringe. The mixture was incubated in the reaction loop during an appropriate time interval and injected into the quartz flow cell, followed by a single pulse of laser irradiation linked to the Q-switch emission of the laser. The resulting dead time of our experiments was on the order of ∼50 ms. Laser UV Cross-linking of MTase with AdoMet—The experimental procedure above permitted us to also perform T4Dam-AdoMet cross-linking. In this case, adduct formation was hyperbolically dependent on the dose of irradiation. The reaction mixture (8-μl final volume) for equilibrium T4Dam-AdoMet cross-linking contained 0.4 μm T4Dam, 0.1–10 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet, and, in one experiment, 0.5 μm duplex M/N (with N6-methyladenine and 2-aminopurine in the target positions of the GATC site; not a substrate for methyl transfer). Following a 5-min preincubation, the sample was irradiated using the laser. Unirradiated mixtures were used for back-ground corrections at each AdoMet concentration. Following irradiation, samples were denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min with 0.1% SDS and spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane filters (0.45 μm; Bio-Rad). Filters were washed three times to remove free AdoMet with phosphate-buffered buffer and once with water and then dried. The amount of [methyl-3H]AdoMet radioactivity cross-linked to protein was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. To obtain a high enough signal-to-back-ground ratio (≥10) under variable background conditions, a series of 10 laser pulses was applied to the samples during these equilibrium titrations. In the time-resolved dissociation experiments, a 15-μl aliquot of preformed T4Dam·[methyl-3H]AdoMet or T4Dam·[methyl-3H]-AdoMet·M/N complex (1 μm T4Dam, 1 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet, and 1.2 μm duplex M/N in the 30-μl final mixture) was rapidly mixed and incubated for an appropriate interval with an equal volume of unlabeled AdoMet (20-fold excess), followed by laser irradiation. Under these conditions, a single pulse was applied to the sample. It should be noted that the use of much higher total concentration of ligands, especially unlabeled ones, may lead to poor adduct formation because of the high intrinsic absorption of UV light (inner filter effect) and hence quenching of the reaction by these ligands. Equilibrium Fluorescence Analysis of MTase-Cofactor Interactions—Fluorescence intensities from equilibrium titrations were measured on a dual-beam difference Shimadzu RF-520 spectrofluorometer. T4Dam alone (1.0 μm) was titrated by incremental addition of AdoMet (2.5–55 μm) in reaction buffer with no albumin. In this case, the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of the protein was excited and detected at wavelengths of 295 nm (slit width of 5 nm) and 340 nm (slit width of 10 nm), respectively. A second control cuvette lacking AdoMet was included to correct for a strong photobleaching effect. In another experiment, T4Dam (160 nm) complexed with 2-aminopurine-substituted non-reactive duplex M/N (160 nm) was titrated with AdoMet (0.25–20 μm). The fluorescence was excited and detected at wavelengths of 320 nm (slit width of 5 nm) and 370 nm (slit width of 10 nm), which correspond to the maxima of 2-aminopurine excitation and emission, respectively (13Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lind-strom Jr.W.M. Reich N.O. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2361-2369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2-Aminopurine-based Stopped-flow Studies—Stopped-flow experiments were performed on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV spectrometer equipped with a 150-watt xenon arc lamp and a 2-mm path length optical cell. Fluorescence emission from 2-aminopurine-substituted non-reactive duplex M/N was observed using a 360-nm long-pass filter. The excitation wavelength was 320 nm with a 14-nm monochromator slit. The dead time of the stopped-flow instrument was 1.4 ms. The preincubated T4Dam·M/N or T4Dam·M/N·AdoMet complex (160 nm T4Dam, 250 nm duplex M/N, and 5 μm AdoMet) was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of either concurrent non-fluorescent duplex A/A (50-fold excess) or AdoMet at varied concentrations (in the case of the T4Dam·M/N complex). Typically, 5–10 fluorescence traces (1000 data points each collected logarithmically with time) were averaged and analyzed for each experiment. Data Analysis—Numerical data were analyzed using Origin 6.1 software (OriginLab). Equilibrium curves (optical densities, counts/min values, or fluorescence intensities) were fitted to a quadratic binding equation (Equation 1) that takes into account ligand depletion (see Ref. 29Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis, Wiley-VCH, New York. 2000; Google Scholar for example), ESrel=F·[ES]=F·0.5·([E]0+[S]0+Kd−(([E]0+[S]0+Kd)2−4·[E]0·[S]0)1/2)(Eq. 1) and the transient curves were described by a single-exponential decay using Equation 2, ESrel=F·[ES]=F·exp(−k·t)(Eq. 2) where [E]0 and [S]0 are the total concentrations of enzyme and one of two substrates, respectively; [ES] is the concentration of their complex; Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant; k is the apparent rate constant; and F is the experimental factor accounting for the cross-linking efficiency or arbitrary fluorescence intensity. For the convenience of pairwise comparison, the cross-linking curves depicted in the figures were normalized to the theoretical maximum values obtained from extrapolation of fittings to infinite concentration (see Figs. 1 and 2) or to zero time (see Fig. 3). The association rate constant kon was calculated from the measured dissociation rate constants koff and Kd as kon = koff/Kd.FIGURE 2Equilibrium binding of T4Dam to AdoMet.A and B, laser-induced UV cross-linking of T4Dam with [methyl-3H]AdoMet.

Data were fitted to Equation 2 to give apparent dissociation rate constants as shown in Table 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Equilibrium Binding of T4Dam to DNA—Preliminary studies on T4Dam-DNA cross-linking showed good yields of direct cross-linking (up to 3%) (16Hockensmith J.W. Kubasek W.L. Vorachek W.R. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3512-3518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single laser pulse (∼40 mJ) was sufficient to saturate adduct formation. The cross-linked product remained stable after 5 min of incubation with SDS at 95 °C. The specificity of the cross-link was confirmed using a nonspecific 20-mer duplex with a GTAC palindrome in place of GATC, in which case weak adduct formation was observed only at micromolar concentrations of ligands (data not shown). To probe further the capabilities of the laser UV cross-linking technique, we carried out a series of equilibrium T4Dam-DNA binding experiments. To prevent methylation of non- and hemimethylated substrate duplexes, we used the methyl donor product AdoHcy instead of AdoMet in our titrations. Because the concentrations of DNA and enzyme were comparable, equilibrium binding curves were fitted to Equation 1, which takes into account ligand depletion (29Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis, Wiley-VCH, New York. 2000; Google Scholar). A representative autoradiograph and the resulting titration curves are shown in Fig. 1, in which the intensity of the cross-linked adducts can be seen to increase as a function of protein concentration. The salient findings are summarized as follows (Table 1). (i) The affinity of T4Dam for DNA containing a non-methylated (A/A), hemimethylated (M/A), or fully methylated (M/M) site was M/A > M/M > A/A. (ii) In the ternary complex with AdoHcy, the relative affinity was M/A > M/M ≈ A/A. Bound AdoHcy led to 8- and 3.5-fold higher affinities of the enzyme for duplexes M/A and A/A, respectively, and did not appreciably change the apparent Kd for the methylated DNA product duplex M/M. However, the enzyme's affinity for duplex M/M was 2-fold lower in the presence of AdoMet. These results are in agreement with those reported for other MTases. Thus, AdoMet and its non-reactive analogs generally improve the affinity of an MTase for its substrate DNA. For instance, AdoHcy induced a thousandfold tighter binding of the specific hemimethylated duplex to the (cytosine-C5)-MTase HhaI (30Lindstrom Jr.W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Vilkaitis G. Merkiene E. Serva S. Weinhold E. Klimasauskas S. J. Biol.

The data on the relative affinity in the binary and ternary complexes of T4Dam with DNA duplexes having different states of methylation are consistent with previous reports for the RsrI (32Szegedi S.S.

The gel shift assay is documented as not being an optimum method for probing equilibrium protein-DNA interactions because of cage effects experienced as molecules enter the gel and because of dissociation of the complex as it passes through the gel. Therefore, we suggest that the laser UV cross-linking gave more accurate Kd values because of the short time of the laser irradiation pulse (5 ns in our case) and the ensuing photochemistry that covalently freezes an instant “snap-shot” of the enzyme·substrate complex population. However, it should be noted that the sensitivity of direct laser cross-linking is lower compared with the gel shift assay, being limited by the cross-linking yield. On the other hand, the alternative non-radioactive fluorescent DNA binding assays (such as 2-aminopurine- or polarization anisotropy-based) are less sensitive and fail to directly measure equilibrium constants around and below 10 nm, asis the case for T4Dam MTase.TABLE 1Equilibrium T4Dam-substrate binding constantsSubstrateKdLaser UV cross-linkingAlternative assaynmM/A4.2 ± 0.823aData from Ref. 10 were obtained by gel shift assay.M/A supplemented with AdoHcy0.53 ± 0.30A/A27 ± 743aData from Ref. 10 were obtained by gel shift assay.A/A supplemented with AdoHcy7.6 ± 1.3M/M7.2 ± 0.9M/M supplemented with AdoHcy7.3 ± 1.2M/M supplemented with AdoMet16 ± 4AdoMet5700 ± 6009300 ± 4900bThe value was obtained by equilibrium quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of enzyme Trp residues with AdoMet in the binary complex (Fig. 2C).AdoMet supplemented with M/N450 ± 40302 ± 54cThe value was obtained by equilibrium quenching of the fluorescence of duplex M/N with AdoMet in the ternary complex (Fig. 2D).a Data from Ref. 10Malygin E.G.
