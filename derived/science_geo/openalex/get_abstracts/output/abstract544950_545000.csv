https://openalex.org/W2097335121,"The intestine is one of the first affected organs in Parkinson's disease (PD). PD subjects show abnormal staining for Escherichia coli and α-synuclein in the colon.We recruited 52 PD patients and 36 healthy cohabitants. We measured serum markers and quantified the numbers of 19 fecal bacterial groups/genera/species by quantitative RT-PCR of 16S or 23S rRNA. Although the six most predominant bacterial groups/genera/species covered on average 71.3% of total intestinal bacteria, our analysis was not comprehensive compared to metagenome analysis or 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.In PD, the number of Lactobacillus was higher, while the sum of analyzed bacteria, Clostridium coccoides group, and Bacteroides fragilis group were lower than controls. Additionally, the sum of putative hydrogen-producing bacteria was lower in PD. A linear regression model to predict disease durations demonstrated that C. coccoides group and Lactobacillus gasseri subgroup had the largest negative and positive coefficients, respectively. As a linear regression model to predict stool frequencies showed that these bacteria were not associated with constipation, changes in these bacteria were unlikely to represent worsening of constipation in the course of progression of PD. In PD, the serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein levels were lower than controls, while the levels of serum diamine oxidase, a marker for intestinal mucosal integrity, remained unchanged in PD.The permeability to LPS is likely to be increased without compromising the integrity of intestinal mucosa in PD. The increased intestinal permeability in PD may make the patients susceptible to intestinal dysbiosis. Conversely, intestinal dysbiosis may lead to the increased intestinal permeability. One or both of the two mechanisms may be operational in development and progression of PD."

Human brain development is a precisely orchestrated process requiring multiple genetic and epigenetic interactions and the coordination of cellular and molecular mechanisms, perturbation of which leads to a plethora of neurodevelopmental phenotypes depending on the spatial and temporal effect of the disturbance. Neuronal development has been categorized into three main processes: neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and postmigrational cortical organization and circuit formation. Classification of the various malformations of cortical development has evolved to reflect these underlying developmental processes (Barkovich et al., 2012Barkovich A.J. Guerrini R. Kuzniecky R.I. Jackson G.D. Dobyns W.B.

Although such classifications recapitulate the main developmental steps in brain formation, recent advances challenge the implied boundaries between these clearly defined stages and suggest that the genes implicated in many developmental stages are genetically and functionally interdependent. This can lead to a more pragmatic classification of neurodevelopmental phenotypes that relies primarily on knowledge of genes and gene networks and manifests as a dysfunction or dysfunctions in the mechanisms of protein and pathway actions (Barkovich et al., 2012Barkovich A.J. Guerrini R. Kuzniecky R.I. Jackson G.D. Dobyns W.B.

A fundamental question in the study of brain malformations is the role of structural abnormalities in the promotion of intellectual disability (ID). The two have long been studied together, with particular focus on X-linked ID and recent studies on both autosomal recessive ID and dominant de novo mutations. Genes involved in ID play a role in diverse basic cellular functions, such as DNA transcription and translation, protein degradation, mRNA splicing, chromatin remodeling, energy metabolism, and fatty-acid synthesis and turnover (de Ligt et al., 2012de Ligt J.

Further coordinated study of brain malformations and ID offers the opportunity to potentially relate basic developmental features to elements of higher-level cognitive function. The advent of next-generation sequencing has enabled rapid identification of numerous genes and mechanisms that underlie disorders of brain malformation and ID (Alazami et al., 2015Alazami A.M.

Jamali P. et al.Deep sequencing reveals 50 novel genes for recessive cognitive disorders.Nature. 2011; 478: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Further advances are often limited by the availability of well-characterized and rigorously phenotyped patients and the capacity for detailed analyses of gene function. In this study, we applied whole exome sequencing (WES) to a cohort of 208 patients from 128 mostly consanguineous families with congenital brain malformations and/or ID. Due to the possibility that some post-migrational brain malformations may not be evident on imaging, we did not exclude patients with isolated profound ID from this study. We describe the genes identified by rare variant analyses and highlight candidate novel genes that were present in more than one family with a similar phenotype, clearly fit into known biological processes perturbed in neurodevelopment, or harbored homozygous loss-of-function (LOF) (i.e., stop gain, frameshift, or splice site) variants. The central nervous system (CNS) features and pedigree structures of the 128 families are shown as Figures 1 and S1, respectively. According to their foremost CNS findings and accompanying clinical features (dysmorphic and additional systemic findings), we further classified probands into seven major groups: primary microcephaly (10%), cortical dysgenesis (38%), callosal abnormalities (7%), hindbrain malformations (7%), syndromic brain malformations (19%), non-syndromic ID (7%), and syndromic developmental delay (DD) or ID (12%) (Figure 1B). Multiple affected members (proband and one or two siblings or cousins) were sequenced when available, and in singleton cases, either the trio (unaffected parents and affected proband) or only the proband were sequenced. Figure S2 describes the workflow used to identify candidate disease genes. We identified known variants in 5 known disease genes and 47 novel variants in 42 known disease genes; of these, 19 represented phenotypic expansions wherein trait manifestations were distinct from those previously reported in association with variation in that gene (Table S1; Figure 1C). Variants of unknown significance in known disease genes were considered to probably be associated with the disease if they segregated with the phenotype and were determined damaging or likely damaging by bioinformatic predictions by a majority of five tools (see Experimental Procedures), with evolutionary conservation of the affected amino acid being a prerequisite for missense variants. The preceding criteria were then used to screen for the strongest candidate genes in the remaining cases, with the addition of two factors: (1) an internal database was screened to ensure that no potentially deleterious homozygous or compound heterozygous variants were present in control subjects without brain malformations in the specific gene of interest, and (2) a comprehensive literature and database search was conducted to determine whether the function and expression pattern of the encoded protein could potentially be associated with the phenotype in question. Eventually, in 46 families (36%), we identified potential disease-causing variants in 41 candidate disease genes (Tables 1 and S1; Figures 2C and S2). Rare variants were detected in the PRUNE, VARS, and DHX37 genes in more than one family segregating for a similar phenotype.Table 1Detected SNVs in Potential Candidate Disease Genes in the Study CohortProbandGeneTranscript: Nucleotide; ProteinZygSZ51PRUNENM_021222: c.G383A; p.R128QHetSZ51PRUNENM_021222: c.G820T; p.G174XHetSZ322PRUNENM_021222: c.G316A; p.D30NHomBAB3500PRUNENM_021222: c.G316A; p.D106NHomBAB3737PRUNENM_021222: c.G316A; p.D106NHomBAB3186VARSNM_006295: c.C2653T; p.L885FHomBAB3643VARSNM_006295: c.G3173A; p.R1058QHomBAB4627AGBL2NM_024783: c.C1747T; p.R583XHomBAB6167CPLX1NM_006651: c.G322T; p.E108XHomBAB4453SMARCA1NM_003069: c.C7T; p.Q3XHemBAB4019DHX37NM_032656: c.G1460A; p.R487HHomBAB4434DHX37NM_032656: c.C1257A; p.N419KHomBAB6569ACTL6BNM_016188: c.G893A; p.R298QHomBAB4471CEP97NM_024548: c.A1148G; p.H383RHomBAB6511CINPNM_032630: c.T637G; p.X213GHomBAB5333KIF23NM_004856: c.T755A; p.L252HHomBAB4852OGDHLNM_001143996: c.C2162T; p.S721LHomBAB3407SLC18A2NM_003054: c.705delC; p.G235fsHomBAB4452TTI1NM_014657: c.G2761A; p.D921NHomBAB3415TUT1NM_022830: c.G1411A; p.A471THomBAB4748ANK3NM_020987: c.C9652T; p.L3218FHomBAB3408ARHGAP21NM_020824: c.T3491G; p.I1164RHomBAB6026ASH2LNM_001105214: c.A1444G; p.I482VHomBAB3420ASTN1NM_004319: c.G2224C; p.G742RHomBAB4462C12orf34NM_032829: c.A284T; p.H95LHomBAB4860CDH4NM_001794: c.G1976C; p.R659PHomBAB5209CELSR2NM_001408: c.C3830T; p.P1277LHomBAB4930CSRP2BPNM_020536: c.G1399A; p.E467KHomBAB5192DSCAML1NM_020693: c.G1411A; p.V471IHomBAB5013GTF3C1NM_001520: c.G4096A; p.E1366KHomBAB3740IGFBP4NM_001552: c.C698T; p.T233MHomBAB5373INANM_032727: c.G562A; p.G188RHomBAB4633KLHL15NM_030624: c.G1474A; p.V492IHetBAB3480MXRA8NM_032348: c.T1238A; p.I413NHomBAB4830PLEKHG2NM_022835: c.G1708A; p.G570RHomBAB4519ROS1NM_002944: c.G1094C; p.G365AHomBAB5548SLITRK5NM_015567: c.G2515C; p.E839QHomBAB5382SNAPINNM_012437: c.A163T; p.N55YHomBAB3491SVILNM_003174: c.C2348T; p.S783LHomBAB4017TTC1NM_003314: c.T784G; p.F262VHomBAB4807UBQLN1NM_053067: c.377delA; p.N126fsHomBAB5605ULK2NM_001142610: c.A1733G; p.H578RHomBAB3410USP11NM_004651: c.G722A; p.R241QHomBAB5379PTPRTNM_007050: c.1561-3C > THetBAB5379PTPRTNM_133170: c.T206C; p.V69AHetBAB5720CDK10NM_001160367: c.G857A; p.R286HHomBAB5720CDK10uc002fob.2: c.C512G; p.T171SHomBAB4698HELZNM_014877: c.A3322G; p.I1108VHomBAB4133TNNNM_022093: c.G2516A; p.R839KHomThis table covers 46 families and 41 genes.

See Experimental Procedures for stratification criteria. zyg, zygosity; het, heterozygous; hom, homozygous; hem, hemizygous. Unsupervised clustering of the novel candidate and known mutated disease genes based on their mRNA levels in the brain tissue partitioned them into four subgroups: genes expressed only in early embryonic development, only in fetal development, only in adult brain tissue, or in both embryonic development and adult tissue (Figure 2A). Biological functional annotation of the novel and known mutated genes in our cohort revealed enrichment of the collection in neurogenesis, tRNA metabolic processes, forebrain development, pattern specification process, and cell-cell adhesion (Figure 2B). We next tested whether the novel and known mutated genes have a greater than expected degree of connectivity within a protein-protein interaction network, based upon the known and predicted protein-protein interaction score retrieved from the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database (http://string-db.org). The protein-protein interaction network had a greater degree of interconnectivity than expected by chance (p = 3.26 × 10−3), and could be partitioned into three highly interconnected protein networks consisting of genes significantly enriched in brain development, RNA metabolism, and cytoskeletal organization (Figure 2C). In addition to single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis by WES, we performed systematic screening of the WES data for copy number variant (CNV) alleles and found likely pathogenic CNVs in 10 families (13 affected individuals) (Tables 2 and S2; Figures 3, 4, and S3). Among these families, we identified homozygous deletions in three consanguineous families. First, ∼64 kb homozygous deletion encompassing almost the entire SNX14 gene was identified in patient BAB3498 with ID, microcephaly, and hypotonia (Figure 3D). Second, a 193 kb homozygous deletion encompassing almost the entire AP4E1 gene, previously associated with spastic paraplegia 51 (Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM]: 613744), was found in patient BAB5029 with ID, microcephaly, seizures, spasticity, and hyperintensity changes in both cerebellar hemispheres and subcortical deep white matter (Figure 3A). His brother BAB5030 was not homozygous for this same deletion, and retrospective analysis of their phenotypes indicated that unlike his brother, BAB5030 had neither abnormalities on MRI nor spasticity. The third family had a 173 bp homozygous intragenic deletion in CNTNAP2 identified in BAB3747 and BAB3748, siblings with ID and seizures (Tables 2 and S2; Figure 3). We also identified a hemizygous intragenic deletion interrupting exons 46 and 47 of DMD in two affected siblings, BAB5866 and BAB5867, with prominently elevated muscle enzymes (creatine kinase > 10,000 U/l). These siblings also showed a Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (MIM: 270400) phenotype explained by a novel homozygous missense mutation in DHCR7 (Tables 1, 2, S1, and S2; Figure 3).Table 2Detected CNVs in the Study CohortBABCNV LocationTypeIncluded GenesZyg3498chr6: 86201694-86282093delSNX14Hom3747chr7: 147092700-147092873delCNTNAP2Hom4097chr7: 153749905-158935238delmany genes (5 Mb); see Table S2Het4097chr15: 98512352-102463263dupmany genes (4 Mb); see Table S2Het4164chr14: 68129193-68162421delRDH11, VTI1BHet5029chr15: 51204274-51397374delAP4E1, TNFAIP8L3Hom5040chr17: 43545574-44159909delCRHR1, MAPT, KANSL1Het5481aFamily with a blended phenotype that presented both SNV and CNV in each affected individual.chr15: 22744254-23255388del15q11.2Het5503chr14: 20295607-24845308del146 genes (5 Mb); see Table S2Het5687chr3: 194392792-197884541dupmany genes (5 Mb); see Table S2Het5687chr6: 348102-5999438delmany genes (5 Mb); see Table S2Het5866aFamily with a blended phenotype that presented both SNV and CNV in each affected individual.chrX: 31947712-31950345delDMDHemIn four families, homozygous (hom) or hemizygous CNVs were detected, while heterozygous (het) were detected in the remaining six families. del, deletion; dup, duplication.a Family with a blended phenotype that presented both SNV and CNV in each affected individual.

See also Figure S3. In the remaining six families, we found heterozygous deletions and duplications (Tables 2 and S2; Figures 4 and S3). Review of the SNVs on the complementary chromosome did not reveal any reduction to homozygosity of a recessive variant in a known disease-associated gene in these loci. Two patients (BAB5687 and BAB4097) had both a terminal deletion and a terminal duplication, possibly suggestive of an unbalanced translocation. Patient BAB5040 had a 17q21.31 deletion (∼6 Mb) involving KANSL1, a gene in which heterozygous deletion CNV and damaging intragenic SNV have been reported in association with Koolen-deVries syndrome (MIM: 610443); patient BAB5481 had 15q11.2 deletion syndrome (MIM: 615656); patient BAB5503 had a 14q11.2 deletion; and patient BAB4164 had a 33 kb deletion including VTI1B and RDH11 (Tables 2 and S2; Figures 4 and S3). In our cohort, 48 families showed cortical dysplasia (atrophy, heterotopia, pachygyria, or schizencephaly) with or without microcephaly, callosal abnormalities, and hindbrain involvement (Figures 1A and 1B). In this clinical phenotypic category, we highlight novel candidate genes in which likely deleterious variants were identified in more than one family: PRUNE (four families), VARS (two families), and DHX37 (two families) (Tables 1 and S1; Figures 5A–5D). Potentially deleterious variants in PRUNE were identified in four families. In two apparently unrelated families from nearby villages in eastern Turkey, we identified an identical homozygous variant (NM_021222: c.G316A; p.D106N) in the PRUNE gene. Both probands (BAB3500 and BAB3737) presented with microcephaly, fronto-temporal cortical atrophy, and cerebellar atrophy (Figures 5A, 5C, and 5D). Based on the proximity of the villages of the two families and the shared absence of heterozygosity (AOH) surrounding the mutation (data not shown), we suggest that a founder effect likely played a role in the etiology (Karaca et al., 2014Karaca E. Weitzer S. Pehlivan D. Shiraishi H. Gogakos T. Hanada T. Jhangiani S.N. Wiszniewski W. Withers M.

In a Saudi Arabian family (SZ322) in which parents were consanguineous, an 18 month old male patient with cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, microcephaly, seizures, and severe DD was found to be homozygous for a rare PRUNE (NM_02122: cG88A; p.D30N) variant. A fourth non-consanguineous family (SZ51) from the US with severe DD, regression, seizures, and microcephaly marked by cerebral and cerebellar volume loss showed compound heterozygous (NM_021222: c.G383A; p.R128Q and NM_021222: c.G520T; p.G174X) variants shared by the two affected siblings. PRUNE (prune homolog, Drosophila) is a phosphodiesterase member of the aspartic acid-histidine-histidine (DHH) phosphoesterase superfamily, highly expressed in the human fetal brain, and fully confined to the nervous system in mouse embryos (Reymond et al., 1999Reymond A.

It has also been shown to cooperate with GSK-3 (serine/threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3) in modulation of focal adhesions and thus to regulate cell migration (Kobayashi et al., 2006Kobayashi T.

Human PRUNE protein contains two main domains: a catalytic DHH domain, and an adjacent aspartic acid-histidine-histidine (Asp-His-His) family-associated motif 2 (DHHA2) domain. All “likely pathogenic” variants identified in our patients map to the DHH domain (Figure 5C). The Turkish variant p.D106N changes one of the three conserved amino acids (Asp-His-His) that form the active site of the protein. Mutation of any of these three amino acids has been shown to severely decrease the enzyme’s activity to hydrolyze short-chain polyphosphates (Tammenkoski et al., 2008Tammenkoski M. Koivula K.

We detected two different homozygous potentially pathogenic variants in VARS that encodes valyl-tRNA synthetase in two unrelated consanguineous pedigrees: NM_006295: c.G3173A; p.R1058Q in BAB3643 and NM_006295.2: c.C2655; p.L885F in siblings BAB3186 and BAB3187 (Figures 5B and 5C). All affected individuals presented with severe DD, microcephaly, seizures, and cortical atrophy on MRI (Figure 5B). The phenotype of these affected individuals was similar to that of the families with the homozygous PRUNE variant and to the previously published patients with CLP1 mutations (Karaca et al., 2014Karaca E.

In two unrelated families, each with one affected proband (BAB4019 and BAB4434), we found two different homozygous variants (NM_032656: c.G1460A; p.R487H and NM_032656: c.C1257A; p.N419K, respectively) in the DHX37 gene (Figures 5B and 5C). BAB4019 presented with severe microcephaly, DD, seizures, and cortical atrophy, and BAB4434 presented with severe microcephaly, polymicrogyria, and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum (Figure 5B). DHX37 encodes a RNA helicase that is a member of the DEAD box protein subfamily, characterized by the evolutionarily conserved motif aspartic acid-glutamic acid-alanine-aspartic acid (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp, or DEAD) (Bleichert and Baserga, 2007Bleichert F.

DEAD box proteins are known to be implicated in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and cellular growth and division (de la Cruz et al., 1999de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P.

In a recent study, it was shown that Dhx37 is required for the biogenesis of glycine receptors in zebrafish and thereby regulates glycinergic synaptic transmission and associated motor behaviors (Hirata et al., 2013Hirata H.

We further screened for any homozygous or hemizygous LOF variants in our cohort. We verified that the observed LOF variants affected all transcripts; checked whether they were in the last exon or last 55 bp of the penultimate exon, which may escape nonsense mediated decay; and reviewed internal and publicly available databases (e.g., the Exome Aggregations Consortium [ExAc], 1000 Genomes, and dbSNP [RRID: nif-0000-02734]) to ensure that no other homozygous LOF variant had been reported in the candidate disease gene. We identified homozygous LOF variants in five families in the following genes: AGBL2, SLC18A2, SMARCA1, UBQLN1, and CPLX1 (Tables 1 and S1; Figure 6). A homozygous nonsense variant (NM_024783: c.C1747T; p.R583X) in the AGBL2 gene was identified in patient BAB4627 with cerebral fronto-parieto-temporal atrophy, simplified gyral pattern; diffuse thinning of the corpus callosum, and seizures (Figures 6A and S4A). AGBL2 encodes a cytoplasmic carboxypeptidase involved in posttranslational modification (detyrosination) of α-tubulin (Sahab et al., 2011Sahab Z.J. Hall M.D. Me Sung Y. Dakshanamurthy S. Ji Y.

Patient BAB4453 presented with microcephaly, spasticity, and ID. He also had dysmorphic features similar to those seen in Coffin-Siris syndrome (MIM: 135900) (Figure 6C). Family history was negative. He was found to have a hemizygous null variant in the SMARCA1 gene (NM_003069: c.C7T; p.Q3X) (Tables 1 and S1; Figure 6C), which encodes a member of the switch/sucrose non-fermentable complex (SWI/SNF) family of proteins and is part of the ATP-dependent CECR2-containing remodeling factor (Figure 6C) (Banting et al., 2005Banting G.S.

In contrast to previous work that relied on the FBI's Supplemental Homicide Reports that were constructed from self-reported cases of police-involved homicide, this data set is less likely to be biased by police reporting practices. County-specific relative risk outcomes of being shot by police are estimated as a function of the interaction of: 1) whether suspects/civilians were armed or unarmed, and 2) the race/ethnicity of the suspects/civilians. The results provide evidence of a significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans relative to unarmed white Americans, in that the probability of being {black, unarmed, and shot by police} is about 3.49 times the probability of being {white, unarmed, and shot by police} on average. Furthermore, the results of multi-level modeling show that there exists significant heterogeneity across counties in the extent of racial bias in police shootings, with some counties showing relative risk ratios of 20 to 1 or more. Finally, analysis of police shooting data as a function of county-level predictors suggests that racial bias in police shootings is most likely to emerge in police departments in larger metropolitan counties with low median incomes and a sizable portion of black residents, especially when there is high financial inequality in that county. There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates."
https://openalex.org/W2171511843,"Background Changes in criteria and differences in populations studied and methodology have produced a wide range of prevalence estimates for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods Uniform criteria were applied to harmonized data from 11 studies from USA, Europe, Asia and Australia, and MCI prevalence estimates determined using three separate definitions of cognitive impairment. Results The published range of MCI prevalence estimates was 5.0%–36.7%. This was reduced with all cognitive impairment definitions: performance in the bottom 6.681% (3.2%–10.8%); Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5 (1.8%–14.9%); Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24–27 (2.1%–20.7%). Prevalences using the first definition were 5.9% overall, and increased with age (P < .001) but were unaffected by sex or the main races/ethnicities investigated (Whites and Chinese). Not completing high school increased the likelihood of MCI (P ≤ .01). Conclusion Applying uniform criteria to harmonized data greatly reduced the variation in MCI prevalence internationally."

These observations indicate that, in the absence of external dynamic cues, grid cells integrate self-generated distance and time information to encode a representation of experience. Grid cells are neurons that fire when a rodent occupies any of a periodic array of locations within an open field (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T. Fyhn M. Molden S. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2005; 436: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar). Based on the observations that grid cell firing patterns persist when external visual information is removed and the same periodic spatial pattern is maintained across environments, it has been suggested that grid cells might update the animal’s location by integrating path-based self-generated motion cues (McNaughton et al., 2006McNaughton B.L.

The Lost Art of Finding Our Way. Belknap Press, Cambridge, MA2013Crossref Google Scholar), and there is considerable evidence that temporal signals are generated in a network of cortical and striatal areas that contribute to timing and provide direct or indirect inputs to the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) (Davis et al., 2009Davis B.

However, there is no direct evidence that grid cells represent either distance traveled or time elapsed during movement. In addition, there is strong evidence that external visual inputs also strongly influence the firing patterns of grid cells: grid cell firing patterns are anchored to external landmarks (Barry et al., 2007Barry C.

Sci. 2014; 369: 20130370Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar to challenge the idea that grid cells provide a distance metric based on self-generated cues alone, although they allow that grid cells might signal distance when visual cues are absent. Here, we explored the extent to which grid cells are activated based on location, time, and distance cues by recording their activity as rats ran in place on a treadmill in a visually rich environment. We report that grid cells provide an integrated representation of self-generated distance and time information in a situation where visual-spatial cues are present but visual flow is eliminated. Rats performed a spatial alternation task on a figure-eight maze (Figure 1A; Movie S1) in which, on each trial, they ran for 14–20 s at 30–49 cm/s on a motorized treadmill embedded in the center stem of the maze. On individual sessions, either the duration (16 s) or the distance of the run (700 cm) was fixed, and the treadmill speed varied randomly across trials. In four rats over 136 recording sessions, 177 cells were classified as grid cells based on spatial firing patterns during open field foraging (see Experimental Procedures). Their firing properties were compared with 147 non-grid cells recorded simultaneously on the same tetrodes (Tables S1 and S2). Although cells were recorded from the MEC and neighboring areas (Experimental Procedures; Figures S2 and S3), grid cells from all regions were similar in their gridness and other features of spatial coding (Figures S5E–S5G), and so these populations were combined to explore whether grid cells defined by their spatial coding properties also encode time or distance. Our initial analyses focused on whether grid and non-grid cells fired continuously during running in fixed place—as might be expected if they represent allocentric location (Hartley et al., 2014Hartley T. Lever C. Burgess N. O’Keefe J. Space in the brain: how the hippocampal formation supports spatial cognition.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2014; 369: 20120510Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar)—or varied in firing rate, indicating influences of self-generated information about elapsed time or distance run. We found many grid cells that fired at specific distances run (most easily observed in distance-fixed sessions, e.g., Figures 1B–1D; Figures S1A–S1C) or at specific moments (most easily observed in time-fixed sessions, e.g., Figures 1E–1H and S1D–S1F). Indeed, most grid cells (162; 92%), as well as most non-grid cells (113; 77%), fired at specific moments or distances during treadmill running. Similar to previous observations of CA1 neurons in animals performing the same task (Kraus et al., 2013Kraus B.J. Robinson II, R.J. White J.A. Eichenbaum H. Hasselmo M.E. Hippocampal “time cells”: time versus path integration.Neuron. 2013; 78: 1090-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), many of these same neurons also expressed firing fields in other regions of the maze when the treadmill was off (Figure S1). To evaluate the distributions of grid and non-grid cells that encode time or distance, we initially combined the data from time-fixed and distance-fixed sessions using a measure of the fraction of the total run (in time or distance; see Experimental Procedures). We found that the firing fields of both grid and non-grid cells were distributed across the entire treadmill run (Figures 2A and 2B ; Figures S2A–S2D). Overall, grid cells more precisely measured run position than other types of neurons recorded in the same brain areas. Thus, grid cells had significantly narrower firing fields than non-grid cells (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: p = 2 × 10−10; Wilcoxon rank-sum test: p = 1 × 10−7; Figures 2D and S2E) and were characterized by significantly sharper tuning (peak firing rate divided by average firing rate) compared to non-grid cells (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: p = 7 × 10−15; Wilcoxon rank-sum test: p = 3 × 10−16; Figures 2E and S2F), even as firing fields for both cell types that appeared later during treadmill running were wider (Pearson’s linear correlation; grid cells: ρ = 0.56, p = 4 × 10−20; non-grid cells: ρ = 0.65, p = 3 × 10−15; Figures 2F and S2G). In addition, many grid cells (77; 44%) had two or more firing fields (Figures 1, 2C, 4, and S1; Table S1). In contrast, fewer non-grid cells (27; 18%) had multiple fields (Figure 2C; Table S1) compared to grid cells, χ2(2) = 28.88, p = 5 × 10−7; and in a previous study (Kraus et al., 2013Kraus B.J. Robinson II, R.J. White J.A. Eichenbaum H. Hasselmo M.E. Hippocampal “time cells”: time versus path integration.Neuron. 2013; 78: 1090-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), we observed only 6% of CA1 cells with multiple firing fields during treadmill running compared to grid cells, χ2(2) = 225.3, p ≈ 0. Therefore, parallel to their spatial firing patterns in the open field, the firing patterns of grid cells are characterized by precise, multi-peaked activations while animals run in place. Furthermore, time and distance modulation by grid cells, expansion of field size over time, and multiple firing fields were observed in each animal and brain area studied (see Experimental Procedures), indicating similar temporal coding features among grid cells throughout cortical areas of the hippocampal system. We quantified the degree to which the rat’s location systematically varied as a function of the fraction of the treadmill run by determining the area that is visited in each of five evenly divided bins (time bins for time-fixed sessions and distance bins for distance-fixed sessions). We refer to this area as AAB (“AB” stands for “all bins”) to distinguish it from the area accounting for 75% of the time spent on the treadmill, which we refer to as A75. The average size of AAB was 44 cm2 (SD = 24.1 cm2; minimum [min], 11 cm2; maximum [max], 156 cm2), and the rats spent, on average, 80% of the treadmill run within this area (SD = 9%; min, 34%; max, 93%). The average size of A75 was 28 cm2 (SD = 16.3 cm2; min, 6 cm2; max, 89 cm2), and AAB contained, on average, 89% of A75 (SD = 12%; min, 30%; max, 100%), indicating that the rats’ positions were relatively stable throughout the treadmill run and that each rat spent a majority of the run in the same area. To quantitatively evaluate the extent to which the observed firing patterns could be explained based on location alone, we used the spatial firing rate map of each neuron (Figure 3) as a look-up table to generate predicted firing rates for that neuron based on the rat’s position at each point in the run (time for time-fixed sessions; distance for distance-fixed sessions; see Experimental Procedures). Next, we generated two tuning curves showing the firing rate of that neuron as a function of time or distance spent on the treadmill for both the actual firing (the empirical time or distance tuning curve) and the firing predictions based solely on the spatial firing rate map (the model time/distance tuning curve) (Figure 3). If location is sufficient to explain the observed firing patterns of each neuron, then the two tuning curves for that neuron should match. Alternatively, if the rat was perfectly stationary while on the treadmill, or if the firing of that neuron was completely uncorrelated with location, the model tuning curve should be perfectly flat. A bootstrap method was used to generate confidence intervals around the time/distance tuning curve for each neuron and to identify regions where the two curves were significantly different. Although nearly all neurons expressed some degree of spatial tuning (indicated by a non-flat model tuning curve), in the majority of neurons with firing fields on the treadmill (155 out of 162 grid cells and 99 out of 113 non-grid cells), there was a region of significant difference between the empirical and model tuning curves, indicating that information about location was not sufficient to explain the firing activity seen on the treadmill. These findings were similar to previous observations of CA1 neurons in animals performing the same task (Kraus et al., 2013Kraus B.J. Robinson II, R.J. White J.A. Eichenbaum H. Hasselmo M.E. Hippocampal “time cells”: time versus path integration.Neuron. 2013; 78: 1090-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), indicating that, during movement in the absence of visual flow, spatial information from visible landmarks and boundaries is not sufficient to drive hippocampal cells or grid cells. Punctate activations of grid cells could reflect distance traveled on the treadmill, consistent with the view of grid cells as involved in path integration based on self-generated movement cues (Buzsáki and Moser, 2013Buzsáki G.

Exploiting our design in which treadmill speed varied across laps, we evaluated the extent to which firing could be explained by time and distance separately and found that both factors contribute to differing extents among neurons. Figures 4A and 4B show two examples of grid cells that were more strongly influenced by distance than time. The firing field in Figure 4B and both firing fields in Figure 4A shifted toward earlier times as the treadmill speed was increased (Figures 4A and 4B, left panels, from top to bottom in the raster plot), but the fields were largely fixed at a particular distance (Figures 4A and 4B, right panels). Conversely, Figures 4C and 4D show two grid cells that were more heavily influenced by time than distance. The field in Figure 4D and the second field in Figure 4C shifted toward farther distances as the speed increased but was fixed at a particular time. Figure 4E shows a non-grid cell that was more heavily influenced by time than distance. To directly compare the extent to which these dimensions are influential across the populations of grid and non-grid cells, three different generalized linear models (time, distance, and time + distance) were fit to the data to quantify the relative influences of time elapsed and distance traveled. A total of 162 grid cells and 113 non-grid cells were analyzed using this framework (Table S2). 80 grid cells (49%) were significantly influenced by time, χ2(5) > 11.1, p < 0.05; 88 (54%) were significantly influenced by distance, χ2(5) > 11.1, p < 0.05; and 66 grid cells (41%) were significantly influenced by both time and distance during treadmill running (Figures 4F, 4G, S3A, S3B, S3E, and S3F; Table S2). Notably, non-grid cells were also influenced by a combination of time and distance (Figures 4H, 4I, S3C, S3D, S3G, and S3H; Table S2). We used a pseudo-R2 measure based on the log-likelihood to determine the degree to which a particular generalized linear model captured the variance in the spike rate for each neuron (see Experimental Procedures). Figure S4 shows the cumulative distribution of the pseudo-R2 values calculated for each neuron for each of six different generalized linear models. The pseudo-R2 for the full model (including time, distance, space, spiking history, and treadmill speed) averaged 0.097 (median = 0.089) for grid cells and 0.069 (median = 0.060) for non-grid cells. See Table S3 for average and median pseudo-R2 values for each generalized linear model and Table S4 for pseudo-R2 values for the example neurons presented in Figures 1, 4, and S1. This analysis revealed that, on average among grid cells, just time or just distance performed better than just space at capturing the variance in the spike rate and that speed contributed very little. However, for non-grid cells, just space performed better, on average, than just time or just distance. Spiking history was the strongest predictor of spike rate variation, which reflects the nature of neurons in these brain regions to fire in bursts. By including the spiking history in the three generalized linear models that were used in our deviance calculations, we accounted for this potential confound when investigating the impact of time and distance. Previous studies have reported that the size and spacing of the spatial fields of grid cells are constant among different familiar environments (Barry et al., 2007Barry C. Hayman R. Burgess N.

However, in mice traversing a linear track in virtual reality, some grid cells are strikingly aperiodic (Domnisoru et al., 2013Domnisoru C. Kinkhabwala A.A. Tank D.W. Membrane potential dynamics of grid cells.Nature. 2013; 495: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and the scale of grid fields in rats traversing linear tracks differs from that in open fields (Brun et al., 2008Brun V.H. Solstad T. Kjelstrup K.B. Fyhn M. Witter M.P. Moser E.I. Moser M.-B.

Also, proprioceptive and vestibular cues are likely not the same when running in place on a treadmill as when running freely in the open field, and in the treadmill, there is a strong mismatch between self-generated motion cues and the lack of optic flow. Here, we compared the size and spacing of firing fields on the treadmill to those expected from the observed grid cell firing patterns recorded from the same cells when the rats ran in the open field. A uniform 2D grid field was simulated for each recorded grid cell, using the observed grid cell width and spacing as input to a simulation of the expected grid field pattern in an environment with dimensions as large as the distance traveled on the treadmill. Then, we compared the number, size, and spacing of firing fields observed during treadmill running with both those observed in the open arena and separately with simulated 1D paths through the uniform 2D grid field. Firing fields observed on the treadmill were much larger and further spaced than those observed in the open field and those predicted by simulations. Also, in nearly every grid cell, many fewer time fields were observed than predicted by these simulations (Figure 5A). In addition, the simulations predicted that when comparing two adjacent fields, the first field should be wider than the second field just as often as the second field is wider than the first field (Figure 5B, inset). In contrast, in nearly all grid cells with two firing fields during treadmill running, the second field was larger than the first field (Figure 5B), paralleling our previous observation of CA1 time cells (Kraus et al., 2013Kraus B.J. Robinson II, R.J. White J.A. Eichenbaum H. Hasselmo M.E. Hippocampal “time cells”: time versus path integration.Neuron. 2013; 78: 1090-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and suggesting that time and distance representation are non-linear throughout this system. A possible explanation of the differences in number, size, and spacing of fields might be that the grid fields are “rescaled” for the distance run, although rescaling observed in extended environments is temporary (Barry et al., 2007Barry C. Hayman R. Burgess N. Jeffery K.J. Experience-dependent rescaling of entorhinal grids.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 682-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, rescaling predicts a strong correlation between the open field and treadmill field sizes and spacing, but we found no correlation between the simulated and observed first firing field sizes (Figure 5C; ρ = 0.09, p = 0.25), second firing field sizes (Figure 5C; ρ = 0.078, p = 0.50), or the spacing (Figure 5D; ρ = 0.031, p = 0.79). Therefore, the spiking output of grid cells based on purely temporal and self-motion information differs from the spiking output when external cues are available in open arenas and when the dynamics of optic flow during motion registers with temporal and motion cues. Previous simulations demonstrated that both grid cells and time cells could be simulated with the same circuit model (Hasselmo, 2008Hasselmo M.E. Grid cell mechanisms and function: contributions of entorhinal persistent spiking and phase resetting.Hippocampus. 2008; 18: 1213-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, the difference from expected size and number of firing fields found here on the treadmill could be due to the absence of fiducial time signals that could keep the circuit spiking calibrated on the treadmill, in contrast to the presence of fiducial sensory landmarks that keep the grid cell spiking calibrated during movement through space. Time is typically characterized by a scalar coding so that the resolution of timing becomes broader as time advances (Gibbon et al., 1997Gibbon J. Malapani C. Dale C.L. Gallistel C.

Consistent with scalar coding of time in brain systems, coding of distance by grid cells during movement in the absence of visual calibration involves a systematic enlargement of field size with increasing time elapsed (as is the coding of time in grid cells and CA1 neurons; see Howard and Eichenbaum, 2013Howard M.W.

https://openalex.org/W1891932798,"Hippocampal place cells undergo remapping when the environment is changed. The mechanism of hippocampal remapping remains elusive but spatially modulated cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) have been identified as a possible contributor. Using pharmacogenetic and optogenetic approaches, we tested the role of MEC cells by examining in mice whether partial inactivation in MEC shifts hippocampal activity to a different subset of place cells with different receptive fields. The pharmacologically selective designer Gi-protein-coupled muscarinic receptor hM4D or the light-responsive microbial proton pump archaerhodopsin (ArchT) was expressed in MEC, and place cells were recorded after application of the inert ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) or light at appropriate wavelengths. CNO or light caused partial inactivation of the MEC. The inactivation was followed by substantial remapping in the hippocampus, without disruption of the spatial firing properties of individual neurons. The results point to MEC input as an element of the mechanism for remapping in place cells."
https://openalex.org/W2129417471,"Longitudinal connectivity is a fundamental characteristic of rivers that can be disrupted by natural and anthropogenic processes. Dams are significant disruptions to streams. Over 2,000,000 low-head dams (<7.6 m high) fragment United States rivers. Despite potential adverse impacts of these ubiquitous disturbances, the spatial impacts of low-head dams on geomorphology and ecology are largely untested. Progress for research and conservation is impaired by not knowing the magnitude of low-head dam impacts. Based on the geomorphic literature, we refined a methodology that allowed us to quantify the spatial extent of low-head dam impacts (herein dam footprint), assessed variation in dam footprints across low-head dams within a river network, and identified select aspects of the context of this variation. Wetted width, depth, and substrate size distributions upstream and downstream of six low-head dams within the Upper Neosho River, Kansas, United States of America were measured. Total dam footprints averaged 7.9 km (3.0-15.3 km) or 287 wetted widths (136-437 wetted widths). Estimates included both upstream (mean: 6.7 km or 243 wetted widths) and downstream footprints (mean: 1.2 km or 44 wetted widths). Altogether the six low-head dams impacted 47.3 km (about 17%) of the mainstem in the river network. Despite differences in age, size, location, and primary function, the sizes of geomorphic footprints of individual low-head dams in the Upper Neosho river network were relatively similar. The number of upstream dams and distance to upstream dams, but not dam height, affected the spatial extent of dam footprints. In summary, ubiquitous low-head dams individually and cumulatively altered lotic ecosystems. Both characteristics of individual dams and the context of neighboring dams affected low-head dam impacts within the river network. For these reasons, low-head dams require a different, more integrative, approach for research and management than the individualistic approach that has been applied to larger dams."

Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of bevacizumab therapy according to different cancer types but these days there is an intense debate on its utility. We have investigated different methods to find the best tumor volume estimation since it creates the possibility for precise and effective drug administration with a much lower dose than in the protocol.We have examined C38 mouse colon adenocarcinoma and HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma. In both cases, three groups were compared in the experiments. The first group did not receive therapy, the second group received one 200 μg bevacizumab dose for a treatment period (protocol-based therapy), and the third group received 1.1 μg bevacizumab every day (quasi-continuous therapy). Tumor volume measurement was performed by digital caliper and small animal MRI. The mathematical relationship between MRI-measured tumor volume and mass was investigated to estimate accurate tumor volume using caliper-measured data. A two-dimensional mathematical model was applied for tumor volume evaluation, and tumor- and therapy-specific constants were calculated for the three different groups. The effectiveness of bevacizumab administration was examined by statistical analysis.In the case of C38 adenocarcinoma, protocol-based treatment did not result in significantly smaller tumor volume compared to the no treatment group; however, there was a significant difference between untreated mice and mice who received quasi-continuous therapy (p = 0.002). In the case of HT-29 adenocarcinoma, the daily treatment with one-twelfth total dose resulted in significantly smaller tumors than the protocol-based treatment (p = 0.038). When the tumor has a symmetrical, solid closed shape (typically without treatment), volume can be evaluated accurately from caliper-measured data with the applied two-dimensional mathematical model.Our results provide a theoretical background for a much more effective bevacizumab treatment using optimized administration."
https://openalex.org/W2110201345,"Objective Anti-synthetase syndrome (anti-SS) is frequently associated with myositis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). We evaluated prospectively, in a multicenter, open-label, phase II study, the efficacy of rituximab on muscle and lung outcomes. Methods Patients were enrolled if they were refractory to conventional treatments (prednisone and at least 2 immunosuppressants). They received 1 g of rituximab at D0, D15, and M6. The primary endpoint was muscular improvement based on manual muscular testing (MMT10, Kendall score in 10 muscles) at M12. Secondary endpoints were normalization of creatine kinase (CK) level, ILD improvement based on forced vital capacity and/or diffuse capacity for carbon monoxide, and number and/or doses of associated immunosuppressants. Results Twelve patients were enrolled, and 10 completed the study. Only 2 patients presented an improvement of at least 4 points on at least two muscle groups (primary end-point). Overall, seven patients had an increase of at least 4 points on MMT10. CK level decreased from 399 IU/L (range, 48–11,718) to 74.5 IU/L (range, 40–47,857). Corticosteroid doses decreased from 52.5 mg/d (range, 10–70) to 9 mg/d (range, 7–65) and six patients had a decrease in the burden of their associated immunosuppressants. At baseline, all 10 patients presented with ILD. At M12, improvement of ILD was observed in 5 out of the 10 patients, stabilization in 4, and worsening in 1. Conclusions This pilot study of rituximab treatment in patients with refractory anti-SS provided data on evolution of muscular and pulmonary parameters. Rituximab should now be evaluated in a larger, controlled study for this homogenous group of patients. Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00774462."

Based on a prior systematic literature review, we developed an integrative model with 15 dimensions of patient-centeredness. The aims of this study were to 1) validate, and 2) prioritize these dimensions.A two-round web-based Delphi study was conducted. 297 international experts were invited to participate. In round one they were asked to 1) give an individual rating on a nine-point-scale on relevance and clarity of the dimensions, 2) add missing dimensions, and 3) prioritize the dimensions. In round two, experts received feedback about the results of round one and were asked to reflect and re-rate their own results. The cut-off for the validation of a dimension was a median < 7 on one of the criteria.105 experts participated in round one and 71 in round two. In round one, one new dimension was suggested and included for discussion in round two. In round two, this dimension did not reach sufficient ratings to be included in the model. Eleven dimensions reached a median ≥ 7 on both criteria (relevance and clarity). Four dimensions had a median < 7 on one or both criteria. The five dimensions rated as most important were: patient as a unique person, patient involvement in care, patient information, clinician-patient communication and patient empowerment.11 out of the 15 dimensions have been validated through experts' ratings. Further research on the four dimensions that received insufficient ratings is recommended. The priority order of the dimensions can help researchers and clinicians to focus on the most important dimensions of patient-centeredness. Overall, the model provides a useful framework that can be used in the development of measures, interventions, and medical education curricula, as well as the adoption of a new perspective in health policy."

The annual incidence of CPP in girls consistently increased at all ages year by year, with greater increases at older ages (≥6 years of age), and smaller increases in girls aged < 6 years. In contrast, the annual incidence remained relatively constant in boys aged < 8 years, while a small increase was observed only in boys aged 8 years. The increase of annual incidence showed significant differences depending on age and gender (P <0.0001).The annual incidence of CPP has substantially increased among Korean girls over the past 7 years.

https://openalex.org/W2119907953,"In the first continent-wide study of the golden jackal (Canis aureus), we characterised its population genetic structure and attempted to identify the origin of European populations. This provided a unique insight into genetic characteristics of a native carnivore population with rapid large-scale expansion. We analysed 15 microsatellite markers and a 406 base-pair fragment of the mitochondrial control region. Bayesian-based and principal components methods were applied to evaluate whether the geographical grouping of samples corresponded with genetic groups. Our analysis revealed low levels of genetic diversity, reflecting the unique history of the golden jackal among Europe's native carnivores. The results suggest ongoing gene flow between south-eastern Europe and the Caucasus, with both contributing to the Baltic population, which appeared only recently. The population from the Peloponnese Peninsula in southern Greece forms a common genetic cluster with samples from south-eastern Europe (ΔK approach in STRUCTURE, Principal Components Analysis [PCA]), although the results based on BAPS and the estimated likelihood in STRUCTURE indicate that Peloponnesian jackals may represent a distinct population. Moreover, analyses of population structure also suggest either genetic distinctiveness of the island population from Samos near the coast of Asia Minor (BAPS, most STRUCTURE, PCA), or possibly its connection with the Caucasus population (one analysis in STRUCTURE). We speculate from our results that ancient Mediterranean jackal populations have persisted to the present day, and have merged with jackals colonising from Asia. These data also suggest that new populations of the golden jackal may be founded by long-distance dispersal, and thus should not be treated as an invasive alien species, i.e. an organism that is ""non-native to an ecosystem, and which may cause economic or environmental harm or adversely affect human health"". These insights into the genetic structure and ancestry of Baltic jackals have important implications for management and conservation of jackals in Europe. The golden jackal is listed as an Annex V species in the EU Habitats Directive and as such, considering also the results presented here, should be legally protected in all EU member states."

The correct balance between glutamatergic excitatory projection neurons (PNs) and local GABAergic inhibitory interneurons (INs) is crucial for the proper function and plasticity of the cerebral cortex, and its misregulation is implicated in a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders (Rossignol, 2011Rossignol E. Genetics and function of neocortical GABAergic interneurons in neurodevelopmental disorders.Neural Plast. 2011; 2011: 649325Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the recognition and pairing of INs and PNs in the developing cortical circuit. PNs and INs are both extremely diverse classes of neurons that must precisely interact in the neocortex to form complex local circuits. PNs are broadly divided into two main subgroups, which contain a variety of neuronal subtypes (Greig et al., 2013Greig L.C. Woodworth M.B. Galazo M.J. Padmanabhan H. Macklis J.D.

Commissural PNs, including callosal PNs (CPNs), are largely located in layer 2/3 (L2/3) and send their axons to the contralateral hemisphere, striatum, and frontal cortex. Corticofugal PNs (CFuPNs) are located in L5 and L6 and connect to subcortical targets including the thalamus, superior colliculus, pons, and spinal cord. The activity of all PNs is modulated by local GABAergic INs, which are classified into distinct subtypes based on molecular identity, morphology, electrophysiological properties, and the location of their synaptic connections (Ascoli et al., 2008Ascoli G.A.

Interneurons of the neocortical inhibitory system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). Among IN subtypes, parvalbumin (PV)-positive cells largely synapse onto the soma of PNs (Buhl et al., 1994Buhl E.H. Halasy K. Somogyi P. Diverse sources of hippocampal unitary inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and the number of synaptic release sites.Nature. 1994; 368: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) and are the major source of miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs) (Soltesz et al., 1995Soltesz I.

Once in their final position, INs form dense connectivity with many neighboring PNs (Fino et al., 2013Fino E. Packer A.M. Yuste R.

However, paired recordings have also shown that connection probabilities among PNs or between PNs and INs depend on the identity of the pre- and post-synaptic partners (Brown and Hestrin, 2009Brown S.P.

Different populations of PNs within L5 receive differing excitatory and inhibitory inputs, and emerging evidence suggests that the strength of inhibition from PV+ cells varies between PN subtypes in L5 (Lee et al., 2014Lee A.T.

Similarly, INs selectively innervate PNs with distinct long-distance targets (Krook-Magnuson et al., 2012Krook-Magnuson E. Varga C. Lee S.H. Soltesz I.

Direct lineage reprogramming of post-mitotic callosal neurons into corticofugal neurons in vivo.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These iCFuPNs acquire molecular properties and long-distance axonal connectivity of endogenous CFuPNs (Rouaux and Arlotta, 2013Rouaux C. Arlotta P. Direct lineage reprogramming of post-mitotic callosal neurons into corticofugal neurons in vivo.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Here, we further demonstrate that individual reprogrammed iCFuPNs also acquire the global molecular signature, somato-dendritic morphology, and intrinsic electrophysiological properties of endogenous CFuPNs. Notably, despite being ectopically distributed among L2/3 CPNs, iCFuPNs receive a level of perisomatic inhibition comparable to endogenous L5 CFuPNs and significantly higher than neighboring L2/3 CPNs. This is at least partly due to a larger number of PV+ synapses onto iCFuPNs and was independent of IN lamination. Thus, reprogramming PN class-specific identity is sufficient to shape PV+ inhibitory input in vivo. We have previously shown that Fezf2 overexpression in postmitotic L2/3 CPNs is sufficient to induce expression of selected CFuPN markers (Rouaux and Arlotta, 2013Rouaux C. Arlotta P. Direct lineage reprogramming of post-mitotic callosal neurons into corticofugal neurons in vivo.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In order to use reprogramming as a tool to probe IN-PN interactions, we first more broadly characterized the extent of molecular reprogramming in this system. We assembled a broad panel of class-specific signature genes that are differentially expressed at either embryonic or postnatal stages of PN differentiation (Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P. Molyneaux B.J. Chen J. Inoue J. Kominami R. Macklis J.D.

Fezf2-GFP (Cdk5r-Fezf2eGFP) or control GFP-only (Cdk5r-emptyeGFP) constructs were overexpressed in cortical progenitors under the postmitotic neuronal promoter Cdk5r (Rouaux and Arlotta, 2013Rouaux C.

Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) via in utero electroporation at E14.5. Single GFP+ neurons were isolated at postnatal day 15 (P15) and profiled for a panel of 88 genes (the 76 markers and 12 controls) using single-cell, fluidics-based quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 1B). Samples were partitioned using Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) and consensus clustering (Monti et al., 2003Monti S. Tamayo P. Mesirov J. Golub T. Consensus Clustering: A Resampling-Based Method for Class Discovery and Visualization of Gene Expression Microarray Data.Mach. Learn. 2003; 52: 91-118Crossref Scopus (1328) Google Scholar), and genes were clustered using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008Langfelder P. Horvath S. WGCNA: an R package for weighted correlation network analysis.BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 559Crossref PubMed Scopus (10274) Google Scholar) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). PAM identified two sample clusters (Figure 1B): Cluster 1 contained the majority of GFP-overexpressing control cells (GFP-CPN) (54/57) and 33/70 Fezf2-overexpressing cells (Fezf2-OE), while Cluster 2 contained the remaining 37 Fezf2-OE cells and 4 GFP-CPNs. Principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed this cluster division (Figure 1C). WGCNA identified four gene modules (Figure 1B, Table S1, and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Module 1 contained CFuPN genes (13/13) that were predominantly upregulated in Cluster 2 (8/13; p < 0.05 and > 2-fold expression change). Module 3 contained predominantly CPN genes (10/13), half of which were downregulated in Cluster 2 (6/13). Importantly, Modules 1 and 3 were significantly anti-correlated within individual cells (Spearman correlation of module eigengenes: r = −0.478, p ≤ 0.0001), indicating coordinate induction of CFuPN markers and repression of CPN markers rather than a mixed cell identity. Overall, 10/12 genes upregulated in Cluster 2 were CFuPN-associated and 6/6 downregulated genes were CPN-associated (Table S1). These results closely resembled the list of genes that were significantly associated with PC1 in the sample PCA (Figure S1A and Table S1). We conclude that approximately half of Fezf2-OE neurons are molecularly reprogrammed into iCFuPNs, acquiring a global CFuPN-like gene expression profile that is distinct from GFP-expressing CPNs and that persists for at least 3 weeks after initial conversion. We next assessed whether iCFuPNs acquire appropriate subtype-specific electrophysiological properties. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording in acute brain slices (P22–P26), we measured 12 intrinsic parameters: 5 related to passive membrane properties and 7 to action potential generation (Table S2). We confirmed that GFP overexpression did not alter any of these parameters (GFP-CPNs versus endogenous L2/3 CPNs) (Figure S2A and Table S2); therefore, to improve the power of analysis, the 8 endogenous L2/3 CPNs and 24 control GFP-CPNs were combined as a single group, hereafter collectively referred to as L2/3 CPNs (Table S2 and Figures 2E–2K). As expected, the intrinsic properties of L2/3 CPNs were distinct from endogenous L5 CFuPNs (identified by cell size; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) (Figure 2 and Table S2) (Mason and Larkman, 1990Mason A. Larkman A. Correlations between morphology and electrophysiology of pyramidal neurons in slices of rat visual cortex. II. Electrophysiology.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1415-1428PubMed Google Scholar). Fezf2-OE cells differed significantly from GFP-CPNs in current threshold (CThr), resting potential (Vm), voltage sag (Vsag), membrane decay constant (Tau), and input resistance (Rm) (Figure S2A and Table S2). They also showed a greater variance in Vm, Vsag, Tau, Rm, and membrane capacitance (Cm), suggesting population heterogeneity (Figure S2A and Table S2). Indeed, two firing patterns were observed: one similar to L5 CFuPNs (iCFuPNs) and the other to L2/3 CPNs (Fezf2-non-reprogrammed; Fezf2-NR) (Figure 2A). PCA on these data also separated Fezf2-OE cells into two groups (Figures 2B, 2C, S2C, and Table S3): the histogram of Fezf2-OE cells on the major axis of variation (PC1, accounting for 41% of the total variance) was best fitted by a two-component Gaussian model (log-likelihood ratio test, LRT, p = 0.017) (Figure 2B). In contrast, the PC1 histograms of L2/3 CPNs and L5 CFuPNs were best fitted with one-component Gaussian distributions, suggesting single populations. We applied supervised machine learning to unbiasedly classify Fezf2-OE cells based on their electrophysiological properties (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figure S2D). Averaging over 1,000 runs of the classifier, 14/33 Fezf2-OE PNs were classified as L5 CFuPNs (∼42%; iCFuPNs), while 19/33 were classified as CPNs (∼58%; Fezf2-NR) (Figures S2F and S2G). After classification, iCFuPNs and Fezf2-NR PNs showed a clear separation in Vm, Vsag, Tau, CThr, voltage threshold (VThr), and fast after-hyperpolarization (fAHP) (Figures 2D–2K and Table S2). This classification ratio is consistent with our previously reported efficiency of molecular reprogramming (Rouaux and Arlotta, 2013Rouaux C. Arlotta P. Direct lineage reprogramming of post-mitotic callosal neurons into corticofugal neurons in vivo.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and in line with our single-cell gene expression analysis. Altogether, the data indicate that individual iCFuPNs shift their molecular signature and intrinsic electrophysiological properties to resemble those of L5 CFuPNs. Whether individual PN subtypes can differentially affect afferent synaptic input from local INs is still debated. Our reprogramming model generates sparse populations of CFuPNs within an ectopic L2/3 location and thus can be used to examine whether PN subclass identity directs local inhibitory synaptic input at the level of individual cells, independent of laminar context. We first assessed the inhibitory network targeting GFP-CPNs, endogenous L5 CFuPNs, and Fezf2-OE PNs using electrophysiological recordings of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) at P22–P26 (Figures 3A–3G). Consistent with previous literature (Lee et al., 2014Lee A.T. Gee S.M. Vogt D. Patel T. Rubenstein J.L. Sohal V.S. Pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex receive subtype-specific forms of excitation and inhibition.Neuron. 2014; 81: 61-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we found that L5 CFuPNs exhibited more frequent inhibitory events than GFP-CPNs (L5 CFuPNs 4.02 ± 0.64 Hz; GFP-CPNs 2.56 ± 0.21 Hz). The average mIPSC frequency in Fezf2-OE cells (3.56 ± 0.25 Hz) was similar to L5 CFuPNs and higher than GFP-CPNs (Figures 3B and 3C), suggesting increased inhibitory input onto iCFuPNs, but the mean amplitude of inhibitory events was similar between all groups (all comparisons: p > 0.05) (Figures 3D and 3E). This increase in inhibition could reflect multiple causes. To exclude the possibility of a change in intrinsic sensitivity of iCFuPNs to GABA, we first examined the subunit composition of GABAA receptors using electrophysiological and molecular analyses. mIPSCs originate mainly from perisomatic synapses (Soltesz et al., 1995Soltesz I. Smetters D.K. Mody I. Tonic inhibition originates from synapses close to the soma.Neuron. 1995; 14: 1273-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which are enriched for α1-containing GABAA (GABRA1) receptors (Hensch, 2005Hensch T.K. Critical period plasticity in local cortical circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar, Klausberger et al., 2002Klausberger T. Roberts J.D. Somogyi P. Cell type- and input-specific differences in the number and subtypes of synaptic GABA(A) receptors in the hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2513-2521PubMed Google Scholar). GABRA1 produces mIPSCs with faster decay kinetics (Picton and Fisher, 2007Picton A.J. Fisher J.L. Effect of the alpha subunit subtype on the macroscopic kinetic properties of recombinant GABA(A) receptors.Brain Res. 2007; 1165: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We found that the decay time constant (weighted τw) of mIPSCs was slower in GFP-CPNs than in L5 CFuPNs (19.81 ± 3.74 ms, 15.04 ± 4.77 ms, respectively, p < 0.001), and this property remained unchanged upon Fezf2 overexpression (19.37 ± 2.92 ms) (Figures 3F and 3G). Differential changes in mIPSC kinetics following benzodiazepine exposure can also reveal differences in the stoichiometry of GABA receptors and changes in synapse location (Kilman et al., 2002Kilman V. van Rossum M.C. Turrigiano G.G. Activity deprivation reduces miniature IPSC amplitude by decreasing the number of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors clustered at neocortical synapses.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Nusser et al., 1998Nusser Z. Hájos N. Somogyi P. Mody I. Increased number of synaptic GABA(A) receptors underlies potentiation at hippocampal inhibitory synapses.Nature. 1998; 395: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Therefore, we recorded mIPSCs before and after application of the GABRA1 agonist Zolpidem, which prolongs the opening of GABRA1+ receptors (Crestani et al., 2000Crestani F. Martin J.R. Möhler H. Rudolph U. Mechanism of action of the hypnotic zolpidem in vivo.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1251-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We did not detect any significant difference in Zolpidem-induced changes in mIPSC amplitude, decay kinetics, or charge transfer (Figures S3A and S3B), indicating that the density of GABRA1+ receptors is unchanged between iCFuPNs and CPNs. Finally, we performed single-cell quantitative RT-PCR on P15 iCFuPNs and GFP-CPNs for all ten GABA receptors known to be expressed in the cerebral cortex (Wisden et al., 1992Wisden W. Laurie D.J. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. The distribution of 13 GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs in the rat brain. I. Telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1040-1062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures S3C–S3F). We found no significant differences in either the proportion of RNA-positive cells or the mean expression level among RNA-positive cells for any receptor (Figures S3E and S3F). Together, these results indicate that the increased inhibition of iCFuPNs is not due to a stoichiometric change in GABAA receptor subunits. Another possible explanation for the observed increased inhibition onto iCFuPNs cells is a nonspecific homeostatic change in the upper cortical circuit. We therefore directly compared the frequency of inhibition in iCFuPNs and Fezf2-NR cells within the same brains (Figures 3H–3M and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). iCFuPNs showed increased mIPSC frequency not only across animals (Figure 3J) but also between iCFuPNs and Fezf2-NR neurons within the same brain (Figure 3L), confirming that the increase of inhibition is a result of cell-specific IN-iCFuPN interactions and not of a global change in the local circuitry. We next considered whether the observed increase in inhibition could be due to inhibitory input onto distinct regions of PNs (e.g., cell soma, axon hillock, or dendritic arbor), as CFuPNs differ from CPNs in cell morphology, including larger somata (Larkman and Mason, 1990Larkman A. Mason A. Correlations between morphology and electrophysiology of pyramidal neurons in slices of rat visual cortex. I. Establishment of cell classes.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1407-1414PubMed Google Scholar) and broader apical dendritic tuft arborization (Oswald et al., 2013Oswald M.J. Tantirigama M.L. Sonntag I. Hughes S.M. Empson R.M. Diversity of layer 5 projection neurons in the mouse motor cortex.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 174Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To assess changes in dendritic morphology, we filled cells with biocytin after recording to enable tracing and reconstruction and measured the width of the arborization of the apical tuft (Figures 3H and S3G). In Fezf2-OE cells, tuft width was increased regardless of the reprogramming state of the neuron (GFP-CPN 209.3 ± 23.29 μm; Fezf2-NR 419.3 ± 27.86 μm; iCFuPN 413.1 ± 21.79 μm) (Figures 3H and 3M and S3G). As this increase did not correlate with reprogramming of electrophysiological properties, we conclude that it is unlikely to be the source of the difference in inhibition. Notably, this result also suggests that Fezf2 overexpression can induce specific neuronal traits (i.e., dendritic morphology), even in the absence of a global identity change. As mIPSCs are primarily caused by perisomatic inputs (Soltesz et al., 1995Soltesz I. Smetters D.K. Mody I. Tonic inhibition originates from synapses close to the soma.Neuron. 1995; 14: 1273-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we next analyzed changes in the cell soma. Confocal image stacks of GFP expression in Fezf2-OE and GFP-CPNs were used for 3D reconstruction and rendering, and iCFuPNs were identified by immunostaining for the CFuPN marker Crym (Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P. Molyneaux B.J. Chen J. Inoue J. Kominami R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype-specific genes that control corticospinal motor neuron development in vivo.Neuron. 2005; 45: 207-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, Rouaux and Arlotta, 2013Rouaux C. Arlotta P. Direct lineage reprogramming of post-mitotic callosal neurons into corticofugal neurons in vivo.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We found that the soma height and maximum width of iCFuPNs (GFP+/Crym+) were significantly larger than those of GFP-CPNs (soma height: GFP-CPN 16.02 ± 0.68 μm; iCFuPN 19.89 ± 0.53 μm; soma maximal width: GFP-CPN 13.27 ± 0.56 μm; iCFuPN 14.62 ± 0.31 μm; height/width ratio: GFP-CPN 1.219 ± 0.034 μm; iCFuPN 1.371 ± 0.042 μm) (Figures S4C–S4F). This difference is consistent with previous demonstrations of larger somata and greater height/width ratio in CFuPNs compared to L2/3 CPNs (Larkman and Mason, 1990Larkman A. Mason A. Correlations between morphology and electrophysiology of pyramidal neurons in slices of rat visual cortex. I. Establishment of cell classes.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1407-1414PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, while the height/width ratio of iCFuPN matched that previously reported for endogenous CFuPN (Larkman and Mason, 1990Larkman A. Mason A. Correlations between morphology and electrophysiology of pyramidal neurons in slices of rat visual cortex. I. Establishment of cell classes.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1407-1414PubMed Google Scholar), their absolute dimensions were smaller, suggesting that the increased inhibition observed in iCFuPN cannot be explained by soma-size changes alone. We next considered whether enhanced PN inhibition reflected an increase in the total number of INs surrounding iCFuPNs or an increase in the number of inhibitory synapses from a specific IN subtype. We have previously demonstrated that when an entire class of PNs is substituted with another, the lamination of INs is affected (Lodato et al., 2011Lodato S. Rouaux C. Quast K.B. Jantrachotechatchawan C. Studer M. Hensch T.K. Arlotta P. Excitatory projection neuron subtypes control the distribution of local inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex.Neuron. 2011; 69: 763-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated if our electroporation-based model, which instead causes focal reprogramming of a small proportion of CPNs, results in a local change in the distribution of INs. We concentrated on PV+ INs due to their preferential location within the deep layers of the cortex and the perisomatic nature of their synapses (Otsuka and Kawaguchi, 2009Otsuka T. Kawaguchi Y. Cortical inhibitory cell types differentially form intralaminar and interlaminar subnetworks with excitatory neurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 10533-10540Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, Soltesz et al., 1995Soltesz I. Smetters D.K. Mody I. Tonic inhibition originates from synapses close to the soma.Neuron. 1995; 14: 1273-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The distribution of PV+ INs was quantified in GFP+ regions of Fezf2-OE cortices and compared to the contralateral non-electroporated hemisphere (P28; n = 4). We did not observe a significant change in PV+ IN lamination (Figures S4A and S4B), thus excluding the possibility that the increased inhibition is caused by a higher concentration of INs around the electroporated cells. Next, we examined whether the increased inhibition of iCFuPNs was due to a higher density of PV+ GABAergic synapses onto these neurons. We quantified PV+ puncta density on the cell soma of iCFuPNs (GFP+/Crym+), L5 CFuPNs (Crym+), and GFP-CPNs at P28 (Figure 4A). iCFuPNs acquired a PV+ puncta density equivalent to L5 CFuPNs and higher than GFP-CPNs (L5 CFuPN 0.25 ± 0.003 puncta/μm2; GFP-CPN 0.20 ± 0.003 puncta/μm2; iCFuPN 0.25 ± 0.004 puncta/μm2; iCFuPN versus GFP-CPN p < 0.0001, iCFuPN versus L5 CFuPN p = 0.3056) (Figure 4C), suggesting that their increased inhibition may reflect an increase in PV+ synaptic contacts. To functionally test differences in PV+ IN input to iCFuPNs, we overexpressed Fezf2 in transgenic mice in which PV-Cre induction of ChR2 channelrhodopsin allows optogenetic stimulation of PV+ INs (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We measured the minimal light-evoked response (min-IPSCPV), which likely reflects a single PV+ IN firing event, in L2/3 CPNs, L5 CFuPNs, and Fezf2-OE neurons via whole-cell voltage-clamp recording of PNs during wide-field optogenetic stimulation of PV+ INs (Figures 4D and 4E). There was no significant difference in min-IPSCPV among these cells (all comparisons: p > 0.05) (Figure 4E), suggesting that synapses between single PV+ INs and PNs had a similar physiological strength across groups. To assess the total number of PV synapses, we measured the maximal optogenetically driven IPSC (max-IPSCPV, Figures 4D and 4F) as the plateau response to increasing light intensity. The average max-IPSCPV of endogenous L2/3 CPNs was significantly smaller than that of L5 CFuPNs (L2/3 2,756 ± 268.3 pA; L5 5,067 ± 254.8 pA; p < 0.0001) (Figure 4F), consistent with L5 CFuPNs receiving more PV synapses than L2/3 CPNs. As a population, Fezf2-OE neurons showed an intermediate max-IPSCPV (3,740 ± 260.0 pA). However, fitting the data to a mixed Gaussian distribution showed a bimodal max-IPSCPV response in Fezf2-OE cells (LRT, p = 0.0011): 42% of the population had a mean response similar to L5 CFuPNs (4.89 nA), whereas 58% had a mean response similar to L2/3 CPNs (2.92 nA) (Figure 4G), consistent with our ratio of reprogramming efficiency. Altogether, our data indicate that iCFuPNs acquire increased numbers of PV+ IN inputs to resemble L5 CFuPNs, regardless of their ectopic location. This effect is specific, as endogenous L2/3 CPNs intermingled with iCFuPNs appropriately receive fewer PV+ IN inputs. We conclude that altering PN class-specific identity is sufficient to affect inhibitory synapses from PV+ INs and to change the local inhibitory circuitry. Proper balance between excitation and inhibition in the neocortex is essential for correctly timed brain development and function (Hensch, 2005Hensch T.K. Critical period plasticity in local cortical circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar, Rossignol, 2011Rossignol E. Genetics and function of neocortical GABAergic interneurons in neurodevelopmental disorders.Neural Plast. 2011; 2011: 649325Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Inhibition mediated by PV+ fast-spiking INs is particularly interesting: perisomatic feedforward inhibition ensures temporal precision of signal transduction in PNs (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001Pouille F. Scanziani M. Enforcement of temporal fidelity in pyramidal cells by somatic feed-forward inhibition.Science. 2001; 293: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), and fast-spiking INs can control the direction of activity flow in the local circuit (Xiang et al., 1998Xiang Z. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. GABAA receptor-mediated currents in interneurons and pyramidal cells of rat visual cortex.J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 715-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Reprogramming the identity of neurons within the CNS has attracted attention due to its potential therapeutic application (Amamoto and Arlotta, 2014Amamoto R. Arlotta P. Development-inspired reprogramming of the mammalian central nervous system.Science. 2014; 343: 1239882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here, we used our previously established reprogramming model, in which one class of cortical PNs is converted into another, as a tool to investigate the role of PN class-specific identity in the establishment of the inhibitory microcircuitry. We show that iCFuPNs can reprogram their molecular, morphological, and electrophysiological traits to resemble CFuPNs. Notably, iCFuPNs showed a Vsag equivalent to L5 CFuPNs and larger than that of L2/3 CPNs, consistent with previously reported differences between L2/3 CPNs and L5 CFuPNs (Mason and Larkman, 1990Mason A. Larkman A. Correlations between morphology and electrophysiology of pyramidal neurons in slices of rat visual cortex. II. Electrophysiology.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1415-1428PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that iCFuPNs share functional properties with L5 CFuPNs, as Vsag is a characteristic of hyperpolarization-activated (Ih) current, which is important in regulating neuronal excitability, spike timing precision, and network rhythmic activities (Lüthi and McCormick, 1998Lüthi A. McCormick D.A. H-current: properties of a neuronal and network pacemaker.Neuron. 1998; 21: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We then used this reprogramming model to investigate the contribution of PN identity to the formation of PN-IN microcircuitry. It was recently shown that individual INs preferentially synapse onto specific subtypes of PNs within a given cortical layer (Lee et al., 2014Lee A.T. Gee S.M. Vogt D. Patel T. Rubenstein J.L. Sohal V.S. Pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex receive subtype-specific forms of excitation and inhibition.Neuron. 2014; 81: 61-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, Otsuka and Kawaguchi, 2009Otsuka T. Kawaguchi Y. Cortical inhibitory cell types differentially form intralaminar and interlaminar subnetworks with excitatory neurons.J.

However, whether IN microcircuits specifically recognize different subtypes of PNs on a cell-by-cell basis is still debated. Examining whether this bias also exists for PNs in ectopic locations will help resolve whether this effect is an intrinsic property of the individual PN or a consequence of some element of the normal laminar context. Here we targeted and reprogrammed a subset of upper-layer CPNs, generating ectopic iCFuPNs in L2/3 scattered among normal L2/3 CPNs. These iCFuPNs were recognized and innervated by PV+ INs as L5 CFuPNs, distinct from closely adjacent CPNs. This leads to the conclusion that target selection by INs occurs at the single-neuron level and provides evidence that PNs can, at least in part, guide the establishment of their afferent inhibitory synapses. This supports the theory that INs may be able to selectively modulate only certain PNs even if they are physically intermingled (Krook-Magnuson et al., 2012Krook-Magnuson E. Varga C. Lee S.H.

Together, the data indicate that circuit wiring among PN and IN partners in the neocortex is at least partly controlled by the identity of the PN and that these decisions are made in a single-neuron-to-neuron manner. In addition, the work suggests that direct neuronal reprogramming is a useful tool to investigate the mechanisms that shape the local neocortical microcircuit and to inform future studies on circuit plasticity in the central nervous system.

https://openalex.org/W2162087441,"This study analyzed the rupture risk of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) according to aneurysm characteristics by comparing the differences between two aneurysms in different locations within the same patient. We utilized this self-controlled model to exclude potential interference from all demographic factors to study the risk factors related to IA rupture. A total of 103 patients were diagnosed with IAs between January 2011 and April 2015 and were enrolled in this study. All enrolled patients had two IAs. One IA (the case) was ruptured, and the other (the control) was unruptured. Aneurysm characteristics, including the presence of a daughter sac, the aneurysm neck, the parent artery diameter, the maximum aneurysm height, the maximum aneurysm width, the location, the aspect ratio (AR, maximum perpendicular height/average neck diameter), the size ratio (SR, maximum aneurysm height/average parent diameter) and the width/height ratio (WH ratio, maximum aneurysm width/maximum aneurysm height), were collected and analyzed to evaluate the rupture risks of the two IAs within each patient and to identify the independent risk factors associated with IA rupture. Multivariate, conditional, backward, stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the independent risk factors associated with IA rupture. The multivariate analysis identified the presence of a daughter sac (odds ratio [OR], 13.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-115.87), a maximum aneurysm height ≥7 mm (OR, 4.80; 95% CI, 1.21-18.98), location on the posterior communicating artery (PCOM) or anterior communicating artery (ACOM; OR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.34-7.11) and SR (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.16-3.91) as factors that were significantly associated with IA rupture. The presence of a daughter sac, the maximum aneurysm height, PCOM or ACOM locations and SR (>1.5±0.7) of unruptured IAs were significantly associated with IA rupture."
https://openalex.org/W2100126119,"Synaptic vesicles are tethered to the active zone where they are docked/primed so that they can fuse rapidly upon Ca(2+) influx. To directly study these steps at a CNS presynaptic terminal, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy at the live isolated calyx of Held terminal and measured the movements of single synaptic vesicle just beneath the plasma membrane. Only a subset of vesicles within the TIRF field underwent exocytosis. Following exocytosis, new vesicles (newcomers) approached the membrane and refilled the release sites slowly with a time constant of several seconds. Uniform elevation of the intracellular Ca(2+) using flash photolysis elicited an exocytotic burst followed by the sustained component, representing release of the readily releasable vesicles and vesicle replenishment, respectively. Surprisingly, newcomers were not released within a second of high Ca(2+). Instead, already-tethered vesicles became release-ready and mediated the replenishment. Our results reveal an important feature of conventional synapses."

We aimed to determine the inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of a novel automated analysis program compared to manual analysis.In a cross-sectional diagnostic study, 20 non-diabetes controls (mean age 41.4±17.3y, HbA1c 5.5±0.4%) and 26 participants with type 1 diabetes (42.8±16.9y, 8.0±1.9%) underwent two separate IVCCM examinations by one observer and a third by an independent observer. Along with nerve density and branch density, corneal nerve fibre length (CNFL) was obtained by manual analysis (CNFLMANUAL), a protocol in which images were manually selected for automated analysis (CNFLSEMI-AUTOMATED), and one in which selection and analysis were performed electronically (CNFLFULLY-AUTOMATED). Reproducibility of each protocol was determined using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and, as a secondary objective, the method of Bland and Altman was used to explore agreement between protocols.Mean CNFLManual was 16.7±4.0, 13.9±4.2 mm/mm2 for non-diabetes controls and diabetes participants, while CNFLSemi-Automated was 10.2±3.3, 8.6±3.0 mm/mm2 and CNFLFully-Automated was 12.5±2.8, 10.9 ± 2.9 mm/mm2. Inter-observer ICC and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were 0.73(0.56, 0.84), 0.75(0.59, 0.85), and 0.78(0.63, 0.87), respectively (p = NS for all comparisons). Intra-observer ICC and 95%CI were 0.72(0.55, 0.83), 0.74(0.57, 0.85), and 0.84(0.73, 0.91), respectively (p<0.05 for CNFLFully-Automated compared to others). The other IVCCM parameters had substantially lower ICC compared to those for CNFL. CNFLSemi-Automated and CNFLFully-Automated underestimated CNFLManual by mean and 95%CI of 35.1(-4.5, 67.5)% and 21.0(-21.6, 46.1)%, respectively.Despite an apparent measurement (underestimation) bias in comparison to the manual strategy of image analysis, fully-automated analysis preserves CNFL reproducibility. Future work must determine the diagnostic thresholds specific to the fully-automated measure of CNFL."
https://openalex.org/W1905036343,"Although Hox genes specify the differentiation of neuronal subtypes along the anterior-posterior axis, their mode of action is not entirely understood. Using two subtypes of the touch receptor neurons (TRNs) in C. elegans, we found that a “posterior induction” mechanism underlies the Hox control of terminal neuronal differentiation. The anterior subtype maintains a default TRN state, whereas the posterior subtype undergoes further morphological and transcriptional specification induced by the posterior Hox proteins, mainly EGL-5/Abd-B. Misexpression of the posterior Hox proteins transformed the anterior TRN subtype toward a posterior identity both morphologically and genetically. The specification of the posterior subtype requires EGL-5-induced repression of TALE cofactors, which antagonize EGL-5 functions, and the activation of rfip-1, a component of recycling endosomes, which mediates Hox activities by promoting subtype-specific neurite outgrowth. Finally, EGL-5 is required for subtype-specific circuit formation by acting in both the sensory neuron and downstream interneuron to promote functional connectivity."

Several factors influence vitamin D levels and its optimal multi-function maintenance. Our objective was to assess quantifiable variables influencing vitamin D level and metabolism in MS patients from Kuwait. In a case-control study involving 50 MS patients, and 50 healthy control individuals for which plasma vitamin D levels, supplement use, vitamin D receptor (VDR) variants, and skin pigmentation indices were ascertained; we found overall vitamin D levels to be deficient in both groups, and supplement use to be common practice. VDR variants TaqI and BsmI associated with MS risk, and ApaI associated with low disease progression. VDR variant FokI associated with higher vitamin D levels in both groups. We conclude that several quantifiable variables related to vitamin D associate with MS suggesting a possible clinical immuno-modulatory application of vitamin D for MS patients in Kuwait."
https://openalex.org/W2134121980,"We performed a pilot proteogenomic study to compare lung adenocarcinoma to lung squamous cell carcinoma using quantitative proteomics (6-plex TMT) combined with a customized Affymetrix GeneChip. Using MaxQuant software, we identified 51,001 unique peptides that mapped to 7,241 unique proteins and from these identified 6,373 genes with matching protein expression for further analysis. We found a minor correlation between gene expression and protein expression; both datasets were able to independently recapitulate known differences between the adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma subtypes. We found 565 proteins and 629 genes to be differentially expressed between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, with 113 of these consistently differentially expressed at both the gene and protein levels. We then compared our results to published adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma proteomic data that we also processed with MaxQuant. We selected two proteins consistently overexpressed in squamous cell carcinoma in all studies, MCT1 (SLC16A1) and GLUT1 (SLC2A1), for further investigation. We found differential expression of these same proteins at the gene level in our study as well as in other public gene expression datasets. These findings combined with survival analysis of public datasets suggest that MCT1 and GLUT1 may be potential prognostic markers in adenocarcinoma and druggable targets in squamous cell carcinoma.

https://openalex.org/W2137607243,"For over 200 years, fossils of bizarre extinct creatures have been described from the Americas that have ranged from giant ground sloths to the 'native' South American ungulates, groups of mammals that evolved in relative isolation on South America. Ground sloths belong to the South American xenarthrans, a group with modern although morphologically and ecologically very different representatives (anteaters, armadillos and sloths), which has been proposed to be one of the four main eutherian clades. Recently, proteomics analyses of bone collagen have recently been used to yield a molecular phylogeny for a range of mammals including the unusual 'Malagasy aardvark' shown to be most closely related to the afrotherian tenrecs, and the south American ungulates supporting their morphological association with condylarths. However, proteomics results generate partial sequence information that could impact upon the phylogenetic placement that has not been appropriately tested. For comparison, this paper examines the phylogenetic potential of proteomics-based sequencing through the analysis of collagen extracted from two extinct giant ground sloths, Lestodon and Megatherium. The ground sloths were placed as sister taxa to extant sloths, but with a closer relationship between Lestodon and the extant sloths than the basal Megatherium. These results highlight that proteomics methods could yield plausible phylogenies that share similarities with other methods, but have the potential to be more useful in fossils beyond the limits of ancient DNA survival."

This study was to identify predictive determinants for patient satisfaction with pharmacy services using national-level data.A cross-sectional evaluation was conducted using 2008 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data. To assess the predictive factors for patient satisfaction with pharmacy services, an ordinal logistic regression model was conducted adjusting for patient characteristics, clinical comorbidities, and perception of health.A total of 9,744 people, a representative sample of 48.2 million Koreans, participated in the 2008 KNHANES, of whom 2,188 (23.6%) reported visits to pharmacy within the last 2 weeks prior to the survey. Of the patients who visited the pharmacy, 74.6% reported to be either ""very satisfied"" or ""satisfied,"" and 25.4% responded as being ""neutral,"" ""dissatisfied,"" or ""very dissatisfied."" A multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis with weighted observations revealed that patients with fair perception of health (adjusted OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.01-1.74; p<0.05) and those with middle to low family incomes (adjusted OR 1.34; 95% CI 1.02-1.76; p<0.05) were more likely to be satisfied with pharmacy services, and employment-based insurers were less likely to be satisfied with pharmacy services (adjusted OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.65-0.97; p<0.05).Our findings indicated that three out of four patients expressed satisfaction toward pharmacy services. Middle to low family incomes, fair perception of health, and employee insured individuals were significant predictors of patient satisfaction with pharmacy services."
https://openalex.org/W2106476921,"Development of serum-free suspension cell culture processes is very important for influenza vaccine production. Previously, we developed a MDCK suspension cell line in a serum-free medium. In the present study, the growth kinetics of suspension MDCK cells and influenza virus production in the serum-free medium were investigated, in comparison with those of adherent MDCK cells in both serum-containing and serum-free medium. It was found that the serum-free medium supported the stable subculture and growth of both adherent and suspension cells. In batch culture, for both cell lines, the growth kinetics in the serum-free medium was comparable with those in the serum-containing medium and a commercialized serum-free medium. In the serum-free medium, peak viable cell density (VCD), haemagglutinin (HA) and median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) titers of the two cell lines reached 4.51×106 cells/mL, 2.94Log10(HAU/50 μL) and 8.49Log10(virions/mL), and 5.97×106 cells/mL, 3.88Log10(HAU/50 μL), and 10.34Log10(virions/mL), respectively. While virus yield of adherent cells in the serum-free medium was similar to that in the serum-containing medium, suspension culture in the serum-free medium showed a higher virus yield than adherent cells in the serum-containing medium and suspension cells in the commercialized serum-free medium. However, the percentage of infectious viruses was lower for suspension culture in the serum-free medium. These results demonstrate the great potential of this suspension MDCK cell line in serum-free medium for influenza vaccine production and further improvements are warranted."

The mechanism of systemic resistance induced by TH12 or its cell-free culture filtrate (CF) in Brassica napus (AACC) and Raphanus alboglabra (RRCC) to powdery mildew disease caused by ascomycete Erysiphe cruciferarum was investigated. In this study, we conducted the first large-scale global study on the cellular and molecular aspects of B. napus and R. alboglabra infected with E. cruciferarum. The histological study showed the resistance of R. alboglabra to powdery mildew disease. The growth of fungal colonies was not observed on R. alboglabra leaves at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 days post-inoculation (dpi), whereas this was clearly observed on B. napus leaves after 6 dpi. In addition, the gene expression of six plant defense-related genes, namely, PR-1, PR-2 (a marker for SA signaling), PR-3, PDF 1.2 (a marker for JA/ET signaling), CHI620, and CHI570, for both genotypes were analyzed in the leaves of B. napus and R. alboglabra after treatment with TH12 or CF and compared with the non-treated ones. The qRT-PCR results showed that the PR-1 and PR-2 expression levels increased in E. cruciferarum-infected leaves, but decreased in the TH12-treated leaves compared with leaves treated with CF. The expression levels of PR-3 and PDF1.2 decreased in plants infected by E. cruciferarum. However, expression levels increased when the leaves were treated with TH12. For the first time, we disclosed the nature of gene expression in B. napus and R. alboglabra to explore the resistance pathways in the leaves of both genotypes infected and non-infected by powdery mildew and inoculated or non-inoculated with elicitor factors. Results suggested that R. alboglabra exhibited resistance to powdery mildew disease, and the application of T. harzianum and its CF are a useful tool to facilitate new protection methods for resist or susceptible plants."
https://openalex.org/W2124340205,"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke and death. Data on the predictors for stroke and death in ‘real-world’ AF patients are limited, especially from large prospective Asian cohorts. Methods The Fushimi AF Registry is a community-based prospective survey designed to enroll all AF patients who visited the participating medical institutions in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, Japan. Follow-up data were available for 3,304 patients (median follow-up period 741 days). We explored the predictors for ‘death, stroke, and systemic embolism (SE)’ during follow-up in 1,541 patients not receiving oral anticoagulants (OAC) at baseline. Results The mean age was 73.1 ± 12.5 years, and 673 (44%) patients were female. The mean CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores were 1.76 and 3.08, respectively. Cumulative events were as follows: stroke/SE in 61 (4%) and death in 230 (15%), respectively. On multivariate analysis, advanced age (hazard ratio (HR): 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24–2.29), underweight (body mass index <18.5 kg/m2) (HR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.25–2.32), previous stroke/SE/transient ischemic attack (HR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.25–2.30), heart failure (HR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.17–2.15), chronic kidney disease (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.16–2.02), and anemia (HR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.78–3.28) were independent predictors for death/stroke/SE. Cumulative numbers of these 6 risk predictors could stratify the incidence of death/stroke/SE in patients without OAC, as well as those with OAC in our registry. Conclusions Advanced age, underweight, previous stroke/SE/transient ischemic attack, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and anemia were independently associated with the risk of death/stroke/SE in non-anticoagulated Japanese AF patients."
https://openalex.org/W2130784123,"Parvalbumin (PV) is a cytosolic Ca2+-binding protein acting as a slow-onset Ca2+ buffer modulating the shape of Ca2+ transients in fast-twitch muscles and a subpopulation of neurons. PV is also expressed in non-excitable cells including distal convoluted tubule (DCT) cells of the kidney, where it might act as an intracellular Ca2+ shuttle facilitating transcellular Ca2+ resorption. In excitable cells, upregulation of mitochondria in ""PV-ergic"" cells in PV-/- mice appears to be a general hallmark, evidenced in fast-twitch muscles and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Using Gene Chip Arrays and qRT-PCR, we identified differentially expressed genes in the DCT of PV-/- mice. With a focus on genes implicated in mitochondrial Ca2+ transport and membrane potential, uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2), mitocalcin (Efhd1), mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (Micu1), mitochondrial calcium uniporter (Mcu), mitochondrial calcium uniporter regulator 1 (Mcur1), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1), and ATP synthase subunit β (Atp5b) were found to be up-upregulated. At the protein level, COX1 was increased by 31 ± 7%, while ATP-synthase subunit β was unchanged. This suggested that these mitochondria were better suited to uphold the electrochemical potential across the mitochondrial membrane, necessary for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Ectopic expression of PV in PV-negative Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells decreased COX1 and concomitantly mitochondrial volume, while ATP synthase subunit β levels remained unaffected. Suppression of PV by shRNA in PV-expressing MDCK cells led subsequently to an increase in COX1 expression. The collapsing of the mitochondrial membrane potential by the uncoupler CCCP occurred at lower concentrations in PV-expressing MDCK cells than in control cells. In support, a reduction of the relative mitochondrial mass was observed in PV-expressing MDCK cells. Deregulation of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffer PV in kidney cells was counterbalanced in vivo and in vitro by adjusting the relative mitochondrial volume and modifying the mitochondrial protein composition conceivably to increase their Ca2+-buffering/sequestration capacity."

https://openalex.org/W2228495115,"Functional modulation of the non-AT1R arm of the renin-angiotensin system, such as via AT2R activation, is known to improve stroke outcome. However, the relevance of the Mas receptor, which along with the AT2R forms the protective arm of the renin-angiotensin system, as a target in stroke is unclear. Here we tested the efficacy of a selective MasR agonist, AVE0991, in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic stroke. Primary cortical neurons were cultured from E15-17 mouse embryos for 7–9 d, subjected to glucose deprivation for 24 h alone or with test drugs, and percentage cell death was determined using trypan blue exclusion assay. Additionally, adult male mice were subjected to 1 h middle cerebral artery occlusion and were administered either vehicle or AVE0991 (20 mg/kg i.p.) at the commencement of 23 h reperfusion. Some animals were also treated with the MasR antagonist, A779 (80 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h prior to surgery. Twenty-four h after MCAo, neurological deficits, locomotor activity and motor coordination were assessed in vivo, and infarct and edema volumes estimated from brain sections. Following glucose deprivation, application of AVE0991 (10−8 M to 10−6 M) reduced neuronal cell death by ~60% (P<0.05), an effect prevented by the MasR antagonist. By contrast, AVE0991 administration in vivo had no effect on functional or histological outcomes at 24 h following stroke. These findings indicate that the classical MasR agonist, AVE0991, can directly protect neurons from injury following glucose-deprivation. However, this effect does not translate into an improved outcome in vivo when administered systemically following stroke."

The aim of this study was to assess risk factors for ICH according to location.In two large prospective studies, SMART (n = 9088) and ESPRIT (n = 2625), including patients with manifest cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral artery disease or with vascular risk factors, we investigated potential risk factors for ICH during follow-up according to lobar or non-lobar location by Cox proportional hazards analyses.During 65,156 patient years of follow up 19 patients had lobar ICH (incidence rate 29, 95% CI 19-42 per 100,000 person-years) and 24 non-lobar ICH (incidence rate 37, 95% CI 26-51 per 100,000 person-years). Age significantly increased the risk of lobar ICH (HR per 10 years increase 1.90; 95% CI 1.17-3.10) in the multivariable analysis, but not of non-lobar hemorrhage. Anticoagulant medication (HR 3.49; 95% CI 1.20-10.2) and male sex (HR 3.79; 95% CI 1.13-12.8) increased the risk of non-lobar but not lobar ICH.This study shows an elevated risk of future ICH in patients with manifestations of, or risk factors for, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral artery disease. Our data suggest that risk factors for ICH vary according to location, supporting the hypothesis of a differential pathophysiology of lobar and non-lobar ICH."
https://openalex.org/W2120653843,"Basal-like breast cancer is a molecularly distinct subtype of breast cancer that is highly aggressive and has a poor prognosis. MicroRNA-29c (miR-29c) has been shown to be significantly down-regulated in basal-like breast tumors and to be involved in cell invasion and sensitivity to chemotherapy. However, little is known about the genetic and regulatory factors contributing to the altered expression of miR-29c in basal-like breast cancer. We here report that epigenetic modifications at the miR-29c promoter, rather than copy number variation of the gene, may drive the lower expression of miR-29c in basal-like breast cancer. Bisulfite sequencing of CpG sites in the miR-29c promoter region showed higher methylation in basal-like breast cancer cell lines compared to luminal subtype cells with a significant inverse correlation between expression and methylation of miR-29c. Analysis of primary breast tumors using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset confirmed significantly higher levels of methylation of the promoter in basal-like breast tumors compared to all other subtypes. Furthermore, inhibition of CpG methylation with 5-aza-CdR increases miR-29c expression in basal-like breast cancer cells. Flourescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) revealed chromosomal abnormalities at miR-29c loci in breast cancer cell lines, but with no correlation between copy number variation and expression of miR-29c. Our data demonstrated that dysregulation of miR-29c in basal-like breast cancer cells may be in part driven by methylation at CpG sites. Epigenetic control of the miR-29c promoter by epigenetic modifiers may provide a potential therapeutic target to overcome the aggressive behavior of these cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2160478777,"Malformin C, a fungal cyclic pentapeptide, has been claimed to have anti-cancer potential, but no in vivo study was available to substantiate this property. Therefore, we conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments to investigate its anti-cancer effects and toxicity. Our studies showed Malformin C inhibited Colon 38 and HCT 116 cell growth dose-dependently with an IC50 of 0.27±0.07μM and 0.18±0.023μM respectively. This inhibition was explicated by Malformin C’s effect on G2/M arrest. Moreover, we observed up-regulated expression of phospho-histone H2A.X, p53, cleaved CASPASE 3 and LC3 after Malformin C treatment, while the apoptosis assay indicated an increased population of necrotic and late apoptotic cells. In vivo, the pathological study exhibited the acute toxicity of Malformin C at lethal dosage in BDF1 mice might be caused by an acute yet subtle inflammatory response, consistent with elevated IL-6 in the plasma cytokine assay. Further anti-tumor and toxicity experiments proved that 0.3mg/kg injected weekly was the best therapeutic dosage of Malformin C in Colon 38 xenografted BDF1 mice, whereas 0.1mg/kg every other day showed no effect with higher resistance, and 0.9mg/kg per week either led to fatal toxicity in seven-week old mice or displayed no advantage over 0.3mg/kg group in nine-week old mice. Overall, we conclude that Malformin C arrests Colon 38 cells in G2/M phase and induces multiple forms of cell death through necrosis, apoptosis and autophagy. Malformin C has potent cell growth inhibition activity, but the therapeutic index is too low to be an anti-cancer drug."

We have previously shown that ·NO plays a significant role in the detoxification of etoposide (VP-16), a topoisomerase II poison in vitro and in human melanoma cells. ·NO/·NO-derived species are reported to modulate activity of several important cellular proteins. As topoisomerases contain a number of free sulfhydryl groups which may be targets of ·NO/·NO-derived species, we have investigated the roles of ·NO/·NO-derived species in the stability and activity of topo I. Here we show that ·NO/·NO-derived species induces a significant down-regulation of topoisomerase I protein via the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway in human colon (HT-29) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines. Importantly, ·NO treatment induced a significant resistance to CPT only in MCF-7 cells. This resistance to CPT did not result from loss of topoisomerase I activity as there were no differences in topoisomerase I-induced DNA cleavage in vitro or in tumor cells, but resulted from the stabilization/induction of bcl2 protein. This up-regulation of bcl2 protein in MCF-7 cells was wtp53 dependent as pifithrine-α, a small molecule inhibitor of wtp53 function, completely reversed CPT resistance, suggesting that wtp53 and bcl2 proteins played important roles in CPT resistance. Because tumors in vivo are heterogeneous and contaminated by infiltrating macrophages, ·NO-induced down-regulation of topoisomerase I protein combined with bcl2 protein stabilization could render certain tumors highly resistant to CPT and drugs derived from it in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2224759997,"Cataract surgery is the most common surgery performed on beneficiaries of Medicare, accounting for more than $3.4 billion in annual expenditures. The purpose of this study is to examine racial and geographic variations in cataract surgery rates and determine the association between the racial composition of the community population and the racial disparity in the likelihood of receiving necessary cataract surgery.Using the national prevalence rates from the National Institute of Eye Health and the 2010 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project-Florida State Ambulatory Surgery Database, we determined the estimated cases of cataract and the actual number of cataract procedures performed, on four race/gender determined groups aged 65 and over in the state of Florida in 2010. The utilization rates and disparity ratios were also calculated for each Florida county. The counties were segmented into groups based on their racial composition. The association between racial composition and disparity ratios in receiving necessary cataract surgery was examined. The Geographic Information System was used to display county-level geospatial relationships.African-Americans have a lower gender-specific cataract prevalence (African-American male = 0.246, African-American female = 0.392, white male = 0.368, and white female = 0.457), but they are also less likely than whites to receive necessary cataract surgery (utilization rate: African-American male = 7.92%, African-American female = 6.17%, white male = 12.08%, and white female = 10.54%). The statistical results show no overall differences between the disparity ratios and the racial composition of the communities. However, our geospatial analyses revealed a concentration of high racial disparity/high white population counties largely along the West Coast and South Central portion of the state.There are racial differences in the likelihood of receiving necessary cataract surgery. However, there is no significant statewide association between the racial composition of the community population and the racial disparity in the likelihood of receiving necessary cataract surgery. Geospatial techniques did, however, identify subpopulations of interest which were not otherwise identifiable with typical statistical approaches, nor consistent with their conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2169079530,"We characterized 12 clinical isolates of Klebsiella oxytoca with the extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype (high minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] values of ceftriaxone) recovered over 9 months at a university hospital in Japan. To determine the clonality of the isolates, we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), and PCR analyses to detect blaRBI, which encodes the β-lactamase RbiA, OXY-2-4 with overproduce-type promoter. Moreover, we performed the isoelectric focusing (IEF) of β-lactamases, and the determination of the MICs of β-lactams including piperacillin/tazobactam for 12 clinical isolates and E. coli HB101 with pKOB23, which contains blaRBI, by the agar dilution method. Finally, we performed the initial screening and phenotypic confirmatory tests for ESBLs. Each of the 12 clinical isolates had an identical PFGE pulsotype and MLST sequence type (ST9). All 12 clinical isolates harbored identical blaRBI. The IEF revealed that the clinical isolate produced only one β-lactamase. E. coli HB101 (pKOB23) and all 12 isolates demonstrated equally resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (MICs, >128 μg/ml). The phenotypic confirmatory test after the initial screening test for ESBLs can discriminate β-lactamase RbiA-producing K. oxytoca from β-lactamase CTX-M-producing K. oxytoca. Twelve clinical isolates of K. oxytoca, which were recovered from an outbreak at one university hospital, had identical genotypes and produced β-lactamase RbiA that conferred resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam. In order to detect K. oxytoca isolates that produce RbiA to promote research concerning β-lactamase RbiA-producing K. oxytoca, the phenotypic confirmatory test after the initial screening test for ESBLs would be useful."
https://openalex.org/W2115450316,"It is not clear whether the strength or endurance of thigh muscles (quadriceps and hamstring) is positively or negatively correlated with the adduction moment of osteoarthritic knees. This study therefore assessed the relationships between the strength and endurance of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles and adduction moment in osteoarthritic knees and evaluated predictors of the adduction moment. The study cohort comprised 35 patients with unilateral medial osteoarthritis and varus deformity who were candidates for open wedge osteotomy. The maximal torque (60°/sec) and total work (180°/sec) of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles and knee adduction moment were evaluated using an isokinetic testing device and gait analysis system. The total work of the quadriceps (r = 0.429, P = 0.037) and hamstring (r = 0.426, P = 0.045) muscles at 180°/sec each correlated with knee adduction moment. Preoperative varus deformity was positively correlated with adduction moment (r = 0.421, P = 0.041). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that quadriceps endurance at 180°/sec was the only factor independently associated with adduction moment (β = 0.790, P = 0.032). The adduction moment of osteoarthritic knees correlated with the endurance, but not the strength, of the quadriceps muscle. However, knee adduction moment did not correlate with the strength or endurance of the hamstring muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2154630734,"Cholesterol is essential for diverse cellular functions and cellular and whole-body cholesterol homeostasis is highly controlled. Cholesterol can also influence cellular susceptibility to injury. The connection between cholesterol metabolism and inflammation is exemplified by the Tm7sf2 gene, the absence of which reveals an essential role in cholesterol biosynthesis under stress conditions but also results in an inflammatory phenotype, i.e. NF-κB activation and TNFα up-regulation. Here, by using Tm7sf2+/+and Tm7sf2−/− mice, we investigated whether the Tm7sf2 gene, through its role in cholesterol biosynthesis under stress conditions, is involved in the renal failure induced by the administration of LPS. We found that the loss of Tm7sf2 gene results in significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen levels accompanied by decreased renal inflammatory response and neutral lipid accumulation. The increased expression of fatty acids catabolic enzymes reduces the need of the renal autophagy, a known crucial nutrient-sensing pathway in lipid metabolism. Moreover, we observed that the Tm7sf2 insufficiency is responsible for the inhibition of the NF-κB signalling thus dampening the inflammatory response and leading to a reduced renal damage. These results suggest a pivotal role for Tm7sf2 in renal inflammatory and lipotoxic response under endotoxemic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2160770915,"Given reports on the increased prevalence of thromboembolic incidents in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; Churg-Strauss syndrome), we investigated whether fibrin clot properties are unfavorably altered in EGPA.Ex vivo plasma fibrin clot characteristics, including clot permeability, turbidimetry and efficiency of fibrinolysis using two assays, were investigated in 34 consecutive patients with remission in EGPA according to the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score version 3 (23 female, 11 male), aged 48 (range, 21-80) years. The control group comprised 34 age- and sex- matched volunteers.Compared with controls, patients with EGPA were characterized by denser fiber clots (estimated pore size, Ks, 7.30±0.93 vs 10.14±1.07 10-9 cm2), faster fibrin polymerization (lag phase in a turbidimetric curve, 41.8±3.6 vs 47.4±2.9 s), thicker fibrin fibers (maximum absorbance, ΔAbs, 0.87±0.09 vs 0.72±0.07), higher maximum levels of D-dimer released from clots (DDmax 4.10±0.46 vs 3.54±0.35 mg/L), and prolonged clot lysis time (t50%; 9.50±1.45 vs 7.56±0.87 min); all p<0.0001. Scanning electron microscopy images confirmed denser plasma fibrin networks composed of thinner fibers formed in EGPA. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody status and C-reactive protein did not affect clot variables. Multivariate analysis adjusted for fibrinogen showed that Ks was predicted by eosinophil count, peak thrombin generation, factor VIII, and soluble CD40 ligand, whereas eosinophil count, peak thrombin generation and antiplasmin predicted t50%.This study is the first to show that EGPA is associated with prothrombotic plasma fibrin clot phenotype, which may contribute to thromboembolic manifestations reported in this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2233802919,"We have previously shown that antibodies to cholera toxin (CT) reacted with the major outer membrane proteins (MOMPs) from Campylobacter jejuni strains on Western blot. Further, oral immunization with CT significantly protected against challenge with C. jejuni in an adult mouse colonization model of infection. CT and the heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are structurally and functionally related. LT and its mutants including the double-mutant LT (R192G/L211A) (dmLT), are powerful mucosal adjuvants. Unlike LT which is reactogenic, dmLT has been shown to be safe for human use. In the current study, we determined whether rabbit anti-dmLT antibodies reacted with MOMPs from C. jejuni strains and whether immunization with dmLT would afford protection against C. jejuni. On Western blot, the MOMPs from C. jejuni 48 (Penner serotype O:19), C. jejuni 75 (O:3) and C. jejuni 111 (O:1,44) were probed with rabbit antibodies to dmLT or LT-E112K (a non-toxic LT mutant), which showed a lack of reaction. Adult BALB/c mice were orally immunized with dmLT and orally challenged with C. jejuni 48 or 111. Protection from colonization with the challenge bacteria was studied by enumerating Campylobacter colonies in feces daily for 9 days. Vaccination produced robust serum and stool antibody responses to dmLT and no antibody responses to C. jejuni MOMP. Vaccinated mice showed reduced colonization and excretion of both challenge strains compared to control mice. However, the differences were not statistically significant. The protective efficacy of the dmLT vaccine varied from 9.1% to 54.5%. The lack of cross-reaction between the MOMP and dmLT suggests that protection is not mediated by cross-reacting antibodies, but may be due to activation of innate immunity. As dmLT is safe for humans, it could be incorporated into a C. jejuni vaccine to enhance its efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2145693518,"Background and Objective The overexpression of gelatinases, that is, matrix metalloproteinase MMP2 and MMP9, has been associated with tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. To image MMP2 in tumors, we developed a novel ligand termed [18F]AlF-NOTA-C6, with consideration that: c(KAHWGFTLD)NH2 (herein, C6) is a selective gelatinase inhibitor; Cy5.5-C6 has been visualized in many in vivo tumor models; positron emission tomography (PET) has a higher detection sensitivity and a wider field of view than optical imaging; fluorine-18 (18F) is the optimal PET radioisotope, and the creation of a [18F]AlF-peptide complex is a simple procedure. Methods C6 was conjugated to the bifunctional chelator NOTA (1, 4, 7-triazacyclononanetriacetic acid) for radiolabeling [18F]AlF conjugation. The MMP2-binding characteristics and tumor-targeting efficacy of [18F]AlF-NOTA-C6 were tested in vitro and in vivo. Results The non-decay corrected yield of [18F]AlF-NOTA-C6 was 46.2–64.2%, and the radiochemical purity exceeded 95%. [18F]AlF-NOTA-C6 was favorably retained in SKOV3 and PC3 cells, determined by cell uptake. Using NOTA-C6 as a competitive ligand, the uptake of [18F]AlF-NOTA-C6 in SKOV3 cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner. In biodistribution and PET imaging studies, higher radioactivity concentrations were observed in tumors. Pre-injection of C6 caused a marked reduction in tumor tissue uptake. Immunohistochemistry showed MMP2 in tumor tissues. Conclusions [18F]AlF-NOTA-C6 was easy to synthesize and has substantial potential as an imaging agent that targets MMP2 in tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2119954558,"Background This study examines whether different sources of cognitive complaint (i.e., self and informant) predict Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology in elders with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods Data were drawn from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform and Neuropathology Datasets (observational studies) for participants with a clinical diagnosis of MCI and postmortem examination (n = 1843, 74±8 years, 52% female). Cognitive complaint (0.9±0.5 years prior to autopsy) was classified into four mutually exclusive groups: no complaint, self-only, informant-only, or mutual (both self and informant) complaint. Postmortem neuropathological outcomes included amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Proportional odds regression related complaint to neuropathology, adjusting for age, sex, race, education, depressed mood, cognition, APOE4 status, and last clinical visit to death interval. Results Mutual complaint related to increased likelihood of meeting NIA/Reagan Institute (OR = 6.58, p = 0.004) and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease criteria (OR = 5.82, p = 0.03), and increased neurofibrillary tangles (OR = 3.70, p = 0.03), neuritic plaques (OR = 3.52, p = 0.03), and diffuse plaques (OR = 4.35, p = 0.02). Informant-only and self-only complaint was not associated with any neuropathological outcome (all p-values>0.12). Conclusions In MCI, mutual cognitive complaint relates to AD pathology whereas self-only or informant-only complaint shows no relation to pathology. Findings support cognitive complaint as a marker of unhealthy brain aging and highlight the importance of obtaining informant corroboration to increase confidence of underlying pathological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2152199285,"Textularia agglutinans d’Orbigny is a non-symbiont bearing and comparatively large benthic foraminiferal species with a widespread distribution across all oceans. In recent years, its populations have considerably expanded along the Israeli Mediterranean coast of the eastern Levantine basin. Despite its exceptionally widespread occurrence, no molecular data have yet been obtained. This study provides the first ribosomal DNA sequences of T. agglutinans complemented with morphological and ecological characterization, which are based on material collected during environmental monitoring of the hard bottom habitats along the Israeli Mediterranean coast, and from the Gulf of Elat (northern Red Sea). Our phylogenetic analyses reveal that all specimens from both provinces belong to the same genetic population, regardless their morphological variability. These results indicate that modern population of T. agglutinans found on the Mediterranean coast of Israel is probably Lessepsian. Our study also reveals that T. agglutinans has an epiphytic life mode, which probably enabled its successful colonization of the hard bottom habitats, at the Mediterranean coast of Israel, which consist of a diverse community of macroalgae. Our study further indicates that the species does not tolerate high SST (> 35°C), which will probably prevent its future expansion in the easternmost Mediterranean in light of the expected rise in temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2230059984,"The transcription factor NF-κB has been associated with a range of pathological conditions of the heart, mainly based on its function as a master regulator of inflammation and pro-survival factor. Here, we addressed the question what effects activation of NF-κB can have during murine heart development. We expressed a constitutively active (CA) mutant of IKK2, the kinase activating canonical NF-κB signaling, specifically in cardiomyocytes under the control of the α-myosin heavy chain promoter. Expression of IKK2-CA resulted in embryonic lethality around E13. Embryos showed defects in compact zone formation and the contractile apparatus, and overall were characterized by widespread inflammation with infiltration of myeloid cells. Gene expression analysis suggested an interferon type I signature, with increased expression of interferon regulatory factors. While apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was only increased at later stages, their proliferation was decreased early on, providing an explanation for the disturbed compact zone formation. Mechanistically, this could be explained by activation of the JAK/STAT axis and increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. A rescue experiment with an IκBα superrepressor demonstrated that the phenotype was dependent on NF-κB. We conclude that activation of NF-κB is detrimental during normal heart development due to excessive activation of pro-inflammatory pathways."

Natural conception may be the only choice in some resource limited settings but data about natural conception is limited. Here, we reported our findings of natural conception in HIV serodiscordant couples. Between January 2008 and June 2014, we retrospectively collected data on 91 HIV serodiscordant couples presenting to Beijing Youan Hospital with childbearing desires. HIV counseling, effective ART on HIV infected partners, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in negative female partners and timed intercourse were used to maximally reduce the risk of HIV transmission. Of the 91 HIV serodiscordant couples, 43 were positive in male partners and 48 were positive in female partners. There were 196 unprotected vaginal intercourses, 100 natural conception and 97 newborns. There were no cases of HIV seroconversion in uninfected sexual partners. Natural conception may be an acceptable option in HIV-serodiscordant couples in resource limited settings if HIV-positive individuals have undetectable viremia on HAART, combined with HIV counseling, PrEP, PEP and timed intercourse."
https://openalex.org/W2227569911,"Bacillus subtilis mutants lacking the SMC-ScpAB complex are severely impaired for chromosome condensation and partitioning, DNA repair, and cells are not viable under standard laboratory conditions. We isolated suppressor mutations that restored the capacity of a smc deletion mutant (Δsmc) to grow under standard conditions. These suppressor mutations reduced chromosome segregation defects and abrogated hypersensitivity to gyrase inhibitors of Δsmc. Three suppressor mutations were mapped in genes involved in tRNA aminoacylation and maturation pathways. A transcriptomic survey of isolated suppressor mutations pointed to a potential link between suppression of Δsmc and induction of the stringent response. This link was confirmed by (p)ppGpp quantification which indicated a constitutive induction of the stringent response in multiple suppressor strains. Furthermore, sublethal concentrations of arginine hydroxamate (RHX), a potent inducer of stringent response, restored growth of Δsmc under non permissive conditions. We showed that production of (p)ppGpp alone was sufficient to suppress the thermosensitivity exhibited by the Δsmc mutant. Our findings shed new light on the coordination between chromosome dynamics mediated by SMC-ScpAB and other cellular processes during rapid bacterial growth."
https://openalex.org/W2210218255,"Multidrug transporters mediate the active extrusion of antibiotics and toxic ions from the cell. This reaction is thought to be based on a switch of the transporter between two conformational states, one in which the interior substrate binding cavity is available for substrate binding at the inside of the cell, and another in which the cavity is exposed to the outside of the cell to enable substrate release. Consistent with this model, cysteine cross-linking studies with the Major Facilitator Superfamily drug/proton antiporter LmrP from Lactococcus lactis demonstrated binding of transported benzalkonium to LmrP in its inward-facing state. The fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 is a substrate for many multidrug transporters and is extruded by efflux pumps in microbial and mammalian cells. Surprisingly, and in contrast to other multidrug transporters, LmrP was found to actively accumulate, rather than extrude, Hoechst 33342 in lactococcal cells. Consistent with this observation, LmrP expression was associated with cellular sensitivity, rather than resistance to Hoechst 33342. Thus, we discovered a hidden ""Janus"" amongst LmrP substrates that is translocated in reverse direction across the membrane by binding to outward-facing LmrP followed by release from inward-facing LmrP. These findings are in agreement with distance measurements by electron paramagnetic resonance in which Hoechst 33342 binding was found to stabilize LmrP in its outward-facing conformation. Our data have important implications for the use of multidrug exporters in selective targeting of ""Hoechst 33342-like"" drugs to cells and tissues in which these transporters are expressed."

In addition to the cytoprotective function of this enzyme, several studies have highlighted the implication of Trx2 in cellular signaling events. In particular, growing evidence points to such roles of redox enzymes in developmental processes taking place in the central nervous system. Here, we investigate the potential implication of Trx2 in embryonic development of chick spinal cord. To this end, we first studied the distribution of the enzyme in this tissue and report strong expression of Trx2 in chick embryo post-mitotic neurons at E4.5 and in motor neurons at E6.5. Using in ovo electroporation, we go on to highlight a cytoprotective effect of Trx2 on the programmed cell death (PCD) of neurons during spinal cord development and in a novel cultured spinal cord explant model. These findings suggest an implication of Trx2 in the modulation of developmental PCD of neurons during embryonic development of the spinal cord, possibly through redox regulation mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2224759489,"The two primary objectives of this paper are: (a) to demonstrate how Comma, a business modeling methodology based on commitments, can be applied in healthcare process modeling, and (b) to evaluate the effectiveness of such an approach in producing healthcare process models. We apply the Comma approach on a breast cancer diagnosis process adapted from an HHS committee report, and presents the results of an empirical study that compares Comma with a traditional approach based on the HL7 Messaging Standard (Traditional-HL7). Our empirical study involved 47 subjects, and two phases. In the first phase, we partitioned the subjects into two approximately equal groups. We gave each group the same requirements based on a process scenario for breast cancer diagnosis. Members of one group first applied Traditional-HL7 and then Comma whereas members of the second group first applied Comma and then Traditional-HL7-each on the above-mentioned requirements. Thus, each subject produced two models, each model being a set of UML Sequence Diagrams. In the second phase, we repartitioned the subjects into two groups with approximately equal distributions from both original groups. We developed exemplar Traditional-HL7 and Comma models; we gave one repartitioned group our Traditional-HL7 model and the other repartitioned group our Comma model. We provided the same changed set of requirements to all subjects and asked them to modify the provided exemplar model to satisfy the new requirements. We assessed solutions produced by subjects in both phases with respect to measures of flexibility, time, difficulty, objective quality, and subjective quality. Our study found that Comma is superior to Traditional-HL7 in flexibility and objective quality as validated via Student's t-test to the 10% level of significance. Comma is a promising new approach for modeling healthcare processes. Further gains could be made through improved tooling and enhanced training of modeling personnel."

https://openalex.org/W2130568140,"Aim Knowledge of the quality of antimicrobial therapy (AMT) used for invasive healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in paediatrics is scarce. Influence of the final information about the isolated pathogen on the subsequent targeted AMT was investigated in our study. Methods Data on 149 children (0–17 years) with blood culture positive HAIs were collected. The causative microbes under investigation were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci, Gram negative rods, and mixed infections were likewise included. For adjusting the antimicrobial regimen, an expert panel evaluated the quality of the targeted AMT and the delay of 72 hours after final microbiology results. AMT was regarded as inappropriate if the pathogen was totally resistant to the used antimicrobials (i) or if the chosen therapy was of not optimal efficacy against the pathogen (ii). Results 17% of the patients received inappropriate AMT. Half of these infections 13/26 (50%) were treated with an antimicrobial to which the isolate was resistant. Three (3/13, 23%) of these patients received antimicrobials which were totally ineffective according to in vitro data. Suboptimal or too broad spectrum AMT was administered to 13/26 (50%) patients. The most common causes of inappropriate use were the use of beta-lactams in oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis infections and vancomycin given in oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infections. Conclusion Approximately 17% of the selected cohort received inappropriate AMT. More attention should be paid to the appropriate use of antimicrobials, and training of prescribers should be urgently provided."

Although tremendous advances have been made to improve measurement of individual child health status or household functioning for use in low-resource settings, little attention has been paid to a more diverse array of settings in which many children in adversity spend time and how context contributes to threats to child protection. The SAFE model posits that insecurity in any of the following fundamental domains threatens security in the others: Safety/freedom from harm; Access to basic physiological needs and healthcare; Family and connection to others; Education and economic security. Site-level tools are needed in order to monitor the conditions that can dramatically undermine or support healthy child growth, development and emotional and behavioral health. From refugee camps and orphanages to schools and housing complexes, site-level threats exist that are not well captured by commonly used measures of child health and well-being or assessments of single households (e.g., SDQ, HOME).The present study presents a methodology and the development of a scale for assessing site-level child protection threats in various settings of adversity. A modified Delphi panel process was enhanced with two stages of expert review in core content areas as well as review by experts in instrument development, and field pilot testing.Field testing in two diverse sites in India-a construction site and a railway station-revealed that the resulting SAFE instrument was sensitive to the differences between the sites from the standpoint of core child protection issues."
