https://openalex.org/W2028649508,"No.7943 (2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea methanesulfonate), a selective inhibitor of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1), has been newly synthesized. It dose-dependently inhibited Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake and Na+i-dependent [Ca2+]i increase in cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and NCX1-transfected fibroblasts (IC50 = 1.2-2.4 µM). Inhibition was observed without prior incubation with the agent and was completely reversed by washing cells with buffer for 1 min. Interestingly, No.7943 was much less potent in inhibiting Na+o-dependent 45Ca2+ efflux and Na+o-induced [Ca2+]i decline (IC50 = >30 µM), indicating that it selectively blocks the reverse mode of Na+/Ca2+ exchange in intact cells. In cardiac sarcolemmal preparations consisting mostly of inside-out vesicles, the agent inhibited Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake and Na+o-dependent 45Ca2+ efflux with similar, but slightly lower, potencies (IC50 = 5.4-13 µM). Inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to Ca2+ and Na+ in both cells and sarcolemmal vesicles. These results suggest that No.7943 primarily acts on external exchanger site(s) other than the transport sites in intact cells, although it is able to inhibit the exchanger from both sides of the plasma membrane. No.7943 at up to 10 µM does not affect many other ion transporters nor several cardiac action potential parameters. This agent at these concentrations also did not influence either diastolic [Ca2+]i or spontaneous beating in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, No.7943 markedly inhibited Ca2+ overloading into cardiomyocytes under the Ca2+ paradox conditions. Thus, No.7943 is not only useful as a tool with which to study the transport mechanism and physiological role of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger but also has therapeutic potential as a selective blocker of excessive Ca2+ influx mediated via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger under pathological conditions.

The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is a major regulator of [Ca2+]i 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+]iintracellular Ca2+ concentration[Ca2+]oextracellular Ca2+ concentrationNa+iintracellular Na+Na+oextracellular Na+SRsarcoplasmic reticulumXIPexchanger inhibitory peptideDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serumBSAbovine serum albuminBSSbalanced salt solutionDHP1,4-dihydropyridineMops4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. in excitable as well as in many nonexcitable cells (1Blaustein M.P.

The exchanger catalyzes bidirectional electrogenic exchange of Na+ for Ca2+ across the plasma membrane, its direction being determined by the magnitude and orientation of electrical and chemical ion gradients. The exchanger works in concert with other cellular Ca2+ transporters including the sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump and Ca2+ channels and intracellular Ca2+ sequestration and release systems. Thus the function of the exchanger under physiological or pathological conditions is often difficult to define, because the membrane potential or intracellular concentrations of Na+ and Ca2+ may vary in different cell types and change in response to agonist or electrical stimulation. intracellular Ca2+ concentration extracellular Ca2+ concentration intracellular Na+ extracellular Na+ sarcoplasmic reticulum exchanger inhibitory peptide Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum bovine serum albumin balanced salt solution 1,4-dihydropyridine 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. Recent molecular cloning studies have revealed that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoforms expressed in various cell types are highly homologous to the cardiac clone and are the product of the same gene (NCX1) (3Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Google Scholar, 4Nakasaki Y. Iwamoto T. Hanada H. Imagawa T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 528-534Google Scholar, 5Kofuji P. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5145-5149Google Scholar). These isoforms, however, differ in a small region near the carboxyl end of the large central loop, which is due to alternative splicing (4Nakasaki Y. Iwamoto T. Hanada H. Imagawa T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 528-534Google Scholar, 5Kofuji P. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5145-5149Google Scholar). In brain and skeletal muscle, a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoform that is a product of a different gene (NCX2) is also expressed (6Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Google Scholar). The physiological role of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger has been studied most extensively in cardiac muscle. During each action potential, the exchanger rapidly extrudes the Ca2+ that has entered the cardiomyocytes via the sarcolemmal L-type Ca2+ channels to trigger the release of Ca2+ from the SR (7Wier W.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 467-485Google Scholar, 8Bridge J.H. Smolley J.R. Spitzer K.W. Science. 1990; 248: 376-378Google Scholar). In addition, the exchanger has been shown to play a much greater role than the sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump in the slow extrusion of Ca2+ from cardiomyocytes during diastole or under resting conditions (7Wier W.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 467-485Google Scholar, 9Bers D.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 639: 375-385Google Scholar). On the other hand, the exchanger appears capable of bringing Ca2+ into cardiomyocytes during cardiac depolarization, although triggering the release of Ca2+ from the SR via the exchanger is much less efficient than via the L-type Ca2+ channels (10Sham J.S.K. Cleemann L. Morad M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 121-125Google Scholar). Under pathological conditions such as ischemia-associated reperfusion injury, the exchanger is thought to cause Ca2+ overloading of cardiomyocytes due to an increase in [Na+]i (11Chapman R.A. Tunstall J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1987; 50: 67-96Google Scholar, 12Tani M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 543-559Google Scholar). In other cell types, including nonexcitable cells such as kidney cells, however, the specific contribution of the exchanger to the [Ca2+]i regulation has been difficult to determine, because of the relatively low density of the exchanger in the plasma membranes of these cells and the lack of a specific inhibitor. A potent and selective inhibitor of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, if available, should be extremely useful to study the reaction mechanism of Na+/Ca2+ exchange and to clarify its physiological and pathophysiological roles. Moreover, such an inhibitor may serve as a therapeutic agent by virtue of its inotropic, cardioprotective, antiarrhythmic, or antihypertensive effects. Although a variety of natural products, synthetic organic compounds, and inorganic cations have been tested for their ability to inhibit the exchanger (13Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. King V.F. Slaughter R.S. Allen T.J. Noble D. Reuter H. Sodium-Calcium Exchange. Oxford Science Publications, Oxford1989: 66Google Scholar), few selective inhibitors exist. Amiloride analogues such as 3′,4′-dichlorobenzamil inhibit Na+/Ca2+ exchange at micromolar concentrations, but they exert a cytotoxic effect by inhibiting a number of other ion transporters and cell metabolism (14Slaughter R.S. Garcia M.L. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Reeves J.P. Kaczorowski G.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2403-2409Google Scholar, 15Kleyman T.R. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 191: 739-755Google Scholar, 16Garcia M.L. King V.F. Shevell J.L. Slaughter R.S. Suarez-Kurtz G. Winquist R.J. Kaczorowski G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3763-3771Google Scholar). On the other hand, XIP, a synthetic peptide derived from the amino acid sequence of the cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, inhibits Na+/Ca2+ exchange with high potency (IC50 = 0.1-1 µM) and relatively high specificity (17Li Z. Nicoll D.A. Collins A. Hilgemann D.W. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Weiss J.N. Tomich J.M. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1014-1020Google Scholar) and has thus been used in previous studies (18Bouchard R.A. Clark R.B. Giles W.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 469: 583-599Google Scholar, 19Kohmoto O. Levi A.J. Bridge J.H.B. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 550-554Google Scholar). However, XIP is highly cationic and interacts with calmodulin. With the latter property, it modulates activities of calmodulin-activated enzymes such as the sarcolemmal Ca2+-ATPase (17Li Z. Nicoll D.A. Collins A. Hilgemann D.W. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Weiss J.N. Tomich J.M. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1014-1020Google Scholar). Since XIP does not seem to permeate through the cell membrane but acts from the cytoplasmic surface, its use is significantly limited. Therefore, development of a new potent inhibitor that is selective for the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in vivo is highly desired. We report here that a newly synthesized compound, 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea methanesulfonate (designated No.7943), is a potent and selective inhibitor of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. This compound (Fig. 1) has been identified by screening a compound library for inhibition of Na+i-dependent Ca2+ uptake into isolated cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles. Surprisingly, this compound selectively inhibits the reverse mode of Na+/Ca2+ exchange in intact cells. We also describe that this compound prevents the excess Ca2+ influx evoked by the Ca2+ paradox, which has been widely studied as an experimental model for Ca2+ overloading in cardiomyocytes. Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared by the method described previously (20Ito H. Hirata Y. Adachi S. Tanaka M. Tsujino M. Koike A. Nogami A. Marumo F. Hiroe M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 398-403Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts from 1- or 2-day-old Wistar rats were minced, and cells were dissociated with 0.1% trypsin in buffer A (20 mM Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 137 mM NaCl, 5.36 mM KCl, 0.81 mM MgSO4, 0.44 mM KH2PO4, 0.34 mM Na2HPO4, and 5.55 mM glucose) containing no added Ca2+. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FCS, 1.5 µM vitamin B12, 1 µg/ml insulin, 5 µg/ml transferrin, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µM streptomycin. Dispersed cells were placed in 150-mm dishes (Falcon) for 1 h, and non-attached cells were seeded onto polystyrene dishes or onto sterile glass coverslips. To inhibit growth of fibroblasts, 10 µM cytosine arabinoside was included in the final culture medium for 48 h. Spontaneously beating cells were used after 3-5 days of culture. Vascular smooth muscle cells were isolated from the thoracic aorta of male Wistar rats (200-300 g) by enzymatic dispersion as described by Chamley et al. (21Chamley J.H. Campbell G.R. McConnell J.D. Groeschel-Stewart U. Cell Tissue Res. 1977; 177: 503-522Google Scholar). The cells were grown for 4 to 5 days in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS and antibiotics as above. After reaching confluency, cells were cultured in serum-free medium for an additional 24-48 h to enhance redifferentiation. CCL39 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 7.5% heat-inactivated FCS and antibiotics. The 3-kilobase SmaI-HindIII fragment of the dog cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger cDNA (3Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Google Scholar, 4Nakasaki Y. Iwamoto T. Hanada H. Imagawa T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 528-534Google Scholar) was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pKCRH (22Mishina M. Kurosaki T. Tobimatsu T. Morimoto Y. Noda M. Yamamoto T. Terao M. Lindstrom J. Takahashi T. Kuno M. Numa S. Nature. 1984; 307: 604-608Google Scholar). CCL39 cells were transfected with the constructed vector and then screened for high expression of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger as described previously (23Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Yamanaka H.I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13609-13615Google Scholar). The selected cells stably expressed about 15-fold higher amounts of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger protein as compared with nontransfected cells. Cells in 24-well dishes were loaded with Na+ by incubation at 37°C for 30 min in 0.5 ml of normal BSS (10 mM Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 146 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, and 0.1% BSA) containing 1 mM ouabain and 10 µM monensin. 45Ca2+ uptake was initiated by switching the medium to Na+-free BSS, replacing NaCl with equimolar choline chloride, or to normal BSS, both of which contained 0.1-4 mM (370 kBq) 45CaCl2, 1 mM ouabain, and 10 µM verapamil. After a 15- or 30-s incubation, 45Ca2+ uptake was stopped by washing cells four times with an ice-cold solution containing 10 mM Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 120 mM choline chloride, and 10 mM LaCl3. Cells were solubilized with 0.1 N NaOH, and aliquots were taken for determination of radioactivity and protein. Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake was estimated by subtracting 45Ca2+ uptake in normal BSS from that in Na+-free BSS. 45Ca2+ efflux from cells cultured in a 35-mm dish was assayed as described previously (24Furukawa K.-I. Tawada Y. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8058-8065Google Scholar). Cells were equilibrated with 45Ca2+ by incubating them at 37°C for 4 h in 1 ml of BSS containing 740 kBq of 45Ca2+. After rinsing cells six times with Ca2+- and Na+-free BSS for 1 min, 45Ca2+ efflux was measured for 20 s in Ca2+- and Na+-free BSS or in Ca2+-free BSS; both solutions contained 1 µM thapsigargin to cause a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. Na+o-dependent 45Ca2+ efflux was estimated by subtracting 45Ca2+ efflux in Ca2+- and Na+-free BSS from that in Ca2+-free BSS. [Ca2+]i was monitored using fura-2 as a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator. Cells cultured on glass coverslips were loaded with 4 µM fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester for 20 min at 37°C in buffer A containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 0.1% BSA (for cardiomyocytes) or in BSS (for smooth muscle cells and transfected CCL39 cells). Loaded cells were then washed twice with the same medium. Glass coverslips were fixed to a mount that was diagonally inserted into a cuvette filled with 2.2 ml of the particular medium. The fluorescence signal was monitored and [Ca2+]i calculated as described previously (25Ohshima N. Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 274-281Google Scholar). Sarcolemmal vesicles were prepared from dog ventricular muscle according to Jones (26Jones L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 85-91Google Scholar). Na+i-dependent Ca2+ uptake into vesicles was measured essentially as described previously (27Vemuri M. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 937: 258-268Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 µl of Na+-loaded vesicles (1-2 mg/ml) was rapidly diluted into 0.25 ml of uptake medium (20 mM Mops/Tris (pH 7.4), 160 mM KCl, 5-80 µM 45CaCl2 (10 kBq), and 0.5 µM valinomycin) at 37°C. The reaction was stopped at 1.5 s by adding 4 ml of ice-cold washing medium (160 mM KCl and 1 mM LaCl3). Vesicles were collected on a glass fiber filter and washed twice with the same medium. Blanks were obtained by measuring 45Ca2+ uptake in medium containing NaCl instead of KCl. These blanks were subtracted from all data points to correct for Na+-independent 45Ca2+ uptake. Na+o-dependent Ca2+ efflux was quantitated by measuring Na+o-induced 45Ca2+ loss from vesicles that had been preloaded with 45Ca2+ by Na+i-dependent Ca2+ uptake (28Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 821: 367-376Google Scholar). Briefly, Na+-loaded vesicles (5 µl) were diluted with 0.5 ml of the uptake medium containing 10 µM 45CaCl2 for 2 min at 37°C. 45Ca2+ efflux was then initiated by addition of 0.5 ml of efflux medium (20 mM Mops/Tris (pH 7.4), 120-160 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EGTA, and 0-40 mM NaCl). The reaction was stopped 10 s later by addition of the washing medium. Blanks were obtained by measuring 45Ca2+ loss in the efflux medium containing no NaCl. L-type Ca2+ channel activity was assayed by measuring DHP-sensitive 45Ca2+ uptake into cultured smooth muscle cells as described previously (25Ohshima N. Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 274-281Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured smooth muscle cells in 24-well dishes were preincubated at 37°C for 30 min in 0.5 ml of normal BSS. To initiate 45Ca2+ uptake, cells were rinsed with BSS containing 1 mM (370 kBq) 45CaCl2 in the presence or absence of 1 µM (+)-PN200-110. After 2 min, 45Ca2+ uptake was stopped, and radioactivity and protein were determined. DHP-sensitive 45Ca2+ uptake was estimated by subtracting 45Ca2+ uptake in the presence of (+)-PN200-110 from that in the absence of (+)-PN200-110. Na+/H+ exchange activity was assayed by measuring 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride-sensitive 22Na+ uptake as described previously (29Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Noel J. Schmitt B. Orlowski J. Pouysságur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26460-26465Google Scholar). Cultured cardiomyocytes in 24-well dishes were preincubated with BSS containing 30 mM NH4Cl for 30 min at 37°C and subsequently washed twice with Na+-free BSS for 40 s. 22Na+ uptake was then initiated by adding the Na+-free BSS containing 1 mM (37 kBq) 22NaCl, 1 mM ouabain, and either 0 or 0.1 mM 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride. After 40 s, cells were washed four times with an ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to stop 22Na+ uptake. Passive 22Na+ uptake into cultured cardiomyocytes was measured for 30 min at 37°C in BSS containing 22NaCl (740 kBq/ml) and 1 mM ouabain. Na+,K+-ATPase activity was measured by incubating cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles (100 µg) for 20 min at 37°C in a 1-ml reaction medium containing 20 mM Hepes/Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM Na2ATP, and 1 mM EGTA. The reaction was stopped by addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and Pi liberated was determined (30Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Google Scholar). The difference between activities in the presence and absence of 0.2 mM ouabain was taken as Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Ca2+-ATPase activity was measured using cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles or SR vesicles that were prepared from dog ventricular muscle (31Imagawa T. Takasago T. Shigekawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 342-348Google Scholar). The ATPase reaction was performed at 37°C with 50 µg of sarcolemmal vesicles for 20 min or with 10 µg of SR vesicles for 1 min in 0.5 ml of standard medium (20 mM Hepes/Tris (pH 7.2), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2 (or 1 mM EGTA), 1 mM ATP, 2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 2 µM A23187), to which 5 µg/ml calmodulin, 1 µM thapsigargin, and 1 mM ouabain were added further when ATP hydrolysis by sarcolemmal vesicles was measured. After the reaction was terminated by adding 3 N HCl (0.1 ml) containing 2.5 mM 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine, pyruvate produced was determined as described previously (32Reynard A.M. Hass L.F. Jacobsen D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2283Google Scholar). The difference between activities in the presence and absence of CaCl2 was taken as Ca2+-ATPase activity. Cardiac action potential was measured according to the standard method (33Chen C.M. Gettes L.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1971; 209: 415-421Google Scholar). Briefly, papillary muscle bundles were isolated from guinea pig right ventricle, which were mounted in a chambered organ bath and superfused with Tyrode's solution (137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM NaH2PO4, 11.9 mM NaHCO3, and 5.5 mM glucose, gassed by 95% O2/5% CO2) at 10 ml/min at 36°C. Muscle preparations were stimulated at a constant rate of 2 Hz through bipolar electrodes with square-wave pulses of 0.5 ms and an intensity 2 times above threshold. Transmembrane electrical activity was recorded with conventional glass microelectrodes with tip resistances of 5-15 MΩ. Transmembrane potentials were measured by a high input impedance preamplifier (MEZ-7200, Nihon Kohden), displayed on dual beam oscilloscope (VC-11, Nihon Kohden), and stored on videotape recorder. The maximum rate of rise of the action potential (max) was obtained by an electronic differentiator with linear differentiation. Protein was measured by the modified Lowry method (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) with BSA as a standard. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Differences for multiple comparisons were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Dunnett's test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. No.7943 (2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea methanesulfonate), 3′,4′-dichlorobenzamil, and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride were synthesized by the New Drug Research Laboratories, Kanebo Ltd. XIP (RRLLFYKYVYKRYRAGKQRG) was synthesized by the Peptide Institute. 45CaCl2 and 22NaCl were purchased from DuPont NEN. Ouabain, monensin, valinomycin, A23187, verapamil, nicardipine, and BSA (fatty acid-free) were from Sigma. Thapsigargin, cytosine arabinoside, and calmodulin were from Wako Pure Chemical Co. Fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester was obtained from Dojindo Laboratories. (+)-PN200-110 was from Sandoz Ltd. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. No.7943 dose-dependently inhibited Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake into rat cardiomyocytes, rat aortic smooth muscle cells, and cardiac NCX1-transfected CCL39 cells (Fig. 2A). The IC50 values for individual cell types were 2.4 ± 0.3, 2.0 ± 0.1, and 1.6 ± 0.2 µM (n = 3), respectively, the complete inhibition occurring at ≥30 µM of this agent. Thus, the inhibitory potency of No.7943 was very similar among these cell types. Under identical conditions, 10 µM 3′,4′-dichlorobenzamil inhibited Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake into rat cardiomyocytes by 30 ± 5% (n = 3). At 30 µM, however, 3′,4′-dichlorobenzamil exhibited cytotoxicity, causing cell rounding and detachment from dishes, whereas the same concentration of No.7943 did not exert such cytotoxicity. In contrast, XIP did not affect the Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake into cardiomyocytes at concentrations up to 100 µM. Of note, the inhibitory potency of No.7943 was identical whether 45Ca2+ uptake was measured for 15 s in cardiac NCX1-transfected CCL39 cells after preincubation with this agent for 5 min (Fig. 2A) or without such preincubation (IC50 = 2.1 ± 0.4 µM (n = 3)). No.7943 at up to 30 µM did not affect 45Ca2+ uptake into nontransfected CCL39 cells (data not shown), which is consistent with the lack of detectable Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake in these cells (23Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Yamanaka H.I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13609-13615Google Scholar). We examined the effect of No.7943 on the rate of Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake into NCX1-transfected cells measured as a function of Ca2+o concentration (Fig. 2B). The observed Ca2+o concentration dependences obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. No.7943 at 1 and 3 µM decreased Vmax to 7.2 ± 0.2 and 4.5 ± 0.3 nmol/mg/15 s (n = 3), respectively, compared with the control value of 8.8 ± 0.1 nmol/mg/15 s (n = 3). No.7943 did not affect the Km (0.14 ± 0.01 mM (n = 3) for control and 0.15 ± 0.01 mM (n = 3) for cells treated with 1 or 3 µM No.7943). We also examined the effect of No.7943 on Na+o-dependent inhibition of Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake into NCX1-transfected cells (Fig. 2C). Na+o inhibited Na+i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 for Na+o was similar in control cells (69 ± 3.1 mM, n = 3) and in cells treated with 1 µM (68 ± 3.4 mM, n = 3) or 3 µM (67 ± 2.2 mM, n = 3) No.7943. Thus, the extent of inhibition by No.7943 was similar at different Na+o concentrations. These results indicate that No.7943 does not compete with Ca2+o or Na+o. Fig. 3 shows the inhibitory effect of No.7943 on Na+i-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i measured in aortic smooth muscle cells in the presence of 10 µM verapamil. A transient increase of [Ca2+]i was induced in these cells by switching the medium from a Na+-containing to a Na+-free solution for 2 min. The IC50, as estimated from the plot of the initial rate of rise in [Ca2+]i versus the No.7943 concentration, was 1.6 ± 0.2 µM (n = 3). This is very close to the IC50 values obtained from the 45Ca2+ uptake measurements (see above). Interestingly, the inhibition by this agent completely disappeared after washing cells with fresh medium for 1 min (Fig. 3), indicating that the effect is fully reversible. The transient nature of [Ca2+]i rise observed here might have arisen, at least in part, from a time-dependent decrease in Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity, which was caused by the exchange-induced reduction in [Na+]i and development of deeper negative membrane potential, as well as by rapid removal of cytoplasmic Ca2+ by the sarcolemmal and SR Ca2+ pumps. In cardiomyocytes, a similar IC50 value (1.2 ± 0.1 µM, n = 3) was also obtained for the inhibition by No.7943 of the initial rate of Na+i-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i. In this experiment, cardiomyocytes were preincubated at 37°C for 20 min with buffer A containing 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM ouabain, 10 µM verapamil, and 0.1 mM Ca2+o, and then an increase in [Ca2+]i was evoked by the addition of 1 mM Ca2+o to the medium. A steady increase in [Ca2+]i was observed at least for 2 min under these conditions (data not shown). We examined the effect of No.7943 on 45Ca2+ efflux from 45Ca2+-labeled NCX1-transfected cells in a Ca2+- and Na+-free medium or in a Ca2+-free medium containing 146 mM Na+ (Fig. 4). The cells were treated with thapsigargin for 20 s to raise [Ca2+]i. In control cells, the rate of Na+o-independent 45Ca2+ efflux was 0.22 ± 0.03 nmol/mg/20 s (n = 4), whereas the rate of Na+o-dependent 45Ca2+ efflux was 0.70 ± 0.13 nmol/mg/20 s (n = 4), as estimated by subtracting 45Ca2+ efflux in the absence of Na+o from that in the presence of Na+o. No.7943 at 10 and 30 µM did not affect Na+o-independent 45Ca2+ efflux but decreased the rate of Na+o-dependent 45Ca2+ efflux by 7 and 38%, respectively. This weak inhibition could not be increased by preincubation of cells with No.7943 for up to 30 min (data not shown). Thus only high doses of No.7943 inhibited Na+o-dependent 45Ca2+ efflux. We studied the effect of No.7943 on the time course of Na+o-induced [Ca2+]i decline in smooth muscle cells under conditions where the sarcolemmal and SR Ca2+ pumps were inhibited by thapsigargin (1 µM) and a Ca2+- and Na+-free, high pH (pH 8.8) medium containing 20 mM MgCl2 (24Furukawa K.-I. Tawada Y. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8058-8065Google Scholar, 35Iwamoto T. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8996-9001Google Scholar). Under these conditions, [Ca2+]i increased to a relatively high level (700-800 nM), and we observed spontaneous decline of [Ca2+]i (30 ± 3 nM/10 s, n = 4) (Fig. 5). Addition of 50 mM Na+o accelerated the [Ca2+]i decline with a resultant initial rate of 157 ± 7 nM/10 s (n = 4), whereas addition of 50 mM choline chloride had no effect. No.7943 at 10 and 30 µM decreased the Na+o-dependent portion of [Ca2+]i decline by 12 ± 5 and 37 ± 2% (n = 4), respectively, although the same concentrations of this agent did not affect the background [Ca2+]i decline (Fig. 5). The inhibitory effect of No.7943 on Na+/Ca2+ exchange was studied using cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles. As in cells, No.7943 completely and dose-dependently inhibited the initial rate of Na+i-dependent Ca2+ uptake into Na+-loaded sarcolemmal vesicles (IC50 = 5.4 ± 0.3 µM (n = 3)) (Fig. 6A). Eadie-Hofstee plots of the rate of Na+i-dependent Ca2+ uptake versus extravesicular [Ca2+]i (Fig. 6B) revealed that 5 µM No.7943 decreased the Vmax to 11 ± 0.2 nmol/mg/1.5 s (n = 3) from the control value of 22 ± 0.6 nmol/mg/1.5 s (n = 3), whereas it did not affect the Km for Ca2+ (35 ± 4.3 µM for control and 34 ± 2.8 µM for the presence of the agent). The results indicate that inhibition is noncompetitive with respect to Ca2+. In contrast, inhibition by XIP was incomplete (about 70%) with an IC50 value of 1.0 ± 0.1 µM (n = 3) (Fig. 6B). 3′,4′-Dichlorobenzamil, on the other hand, completely inhibited Na+i"

A diverse set of molecules including microtubules, grb2, and acidic phospholipids stimulate dynamin GTPase activity in vitro, although the physiological relevance of these effectors remains to be determined. Dynamin has been shown to assemble around microtubules, the most potent stimulatory molecule, into structures indistinguishable by electron microscopy from collars captured in vivo at the necks of endocytic coated pits. Under low ionic strength conditions purified dynamin self-assembles into rings and helical stacks of rings. Here we show that dynamin self-assembly stimulates its GTPase activity as much as 10-fold. Thus, we identify dynamin, itself, as the first effector of dynamin GTPase activity known to be physiologically relevant. Assembled dynamin's stimulated GTPase activity is not dependent on the direct interaction of high affinity GTP binding sites since a mutant defective in GTP binding and hydrolysis can coassemble with and stimulate GTP hydrolysis by wild-type dynamin. Finally, we find that GTP destabilizes assembled dynamin structures, suggesting that the activated rates of GTP hydrolysis reflect a continuing cycle of assembly, GTP hydrolysis, and disassembly.

Finally, we find that GTP destabilizes assembled dynamin structures, suggesting that the activated rates of GTP hydrolysis reflect a continuing cycle of assembly, GTP hydrolysis, and disassembly. Dynamin, a 100-kDa GTPase, is specifically required for endocytic clathrin coated vesicle formation (1Baba T. Damke H. Hinshaw J.E. Ikeda K. Schmid S.L. Warnock D.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 235-242Google Scholar, 2Liu J.-P. Robinson P.J. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 590-607Google Scholar). Mutations in shibire, the Drosophila homologue of dynamin, cause a pleiotropic defect in endocytosis (3Kosaka T. Ikeda K. J. Neurobiol. 1983; 14: 207-225Google Scholar, 4Tsuruhara T. Koenig J.H. Ikeda K. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 259: 199-207Google Scholar). Similarly, transient overexpression of GTPase-defective dynamin mutants blocks receptor-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells (5van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Google Scholar, 6Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Google Scholar). More detailed phenotypic analysis of stable transformants overexpressing the K44A dynamin mutant defective in GTP binding and hydrolysis revealed that clathrin-coated vesicle budding was blocked at a stage following coated pit assembly and invagination, but preceding the formation of constricted coated pits (7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Google Scholar). Receptor-bound ligands that accumulate in these late intermediates in coated vesicle budding are sequestered from exogenously added macromolecular probes but remain accessible to small molecules (8Schmid S.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 145-148Google Scholar). Recombinant human dynamin-1, a neuron-specific isoform, purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, was found to self-assemble under low ionic strength conditions into rings and stacks of rings (9Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 384: 190-192Google Scholar). The dynamin rings were identical in dimension to electron dense “collars” observed around the necks of the endocytic profiles accumulating at nerve terminals in the Drosophila shibirets mutant (10Kosaka T. Ikeda K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 499-507Google Scholar). The suggestion that these collars might correspond to dynamin was confirmed by electron microscopy-immunolocalization of dynamin to electron dense helical bands that assembled on membrane invaginations in permeabilized synaptosome preparations incubated with GTPγS, 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)PRDproline-arginine-rich domainHCBHepes column bufferDTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPipes1,4-piperazinedethanesulfonic acid. a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP (11Takei K. McPherson P. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Google Scholar). These results, together with the immunolocalization of endogenous and overexpressed dynamin molecules specifically to clathrin coated pits (1Baba T. Damke H. Hinshaw J.E. Ikeda K. Schmid S.L. Warnock D.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 235-242Google Scholar, 7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Google Scholar) and the GTP-requirements for coated vesicle formation in vitro (12Carter L.L. Redelmeier T.E. Woollenweber L.A. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 37-45Google Scholar), suggested an early working model (1Baba T. Damke H. Hinshaw J.E. Ikeda K. Schmid S.L. Warnock D.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 235-242Google Scholar, 9Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 384: 190-192Google Scholar) for dynamin function. We have proposed that dynamin is targeted to and evenly distributed on clathrin lattices in its unoccupied or GDP-bound form. GTP-GDP exchange then triggers dynamin to redistribute from the clathrin-lattice and to assemble into collars at the necks of now constricted coated pits. Finally, GTP hydrolysis by dynamin is required, perhaps to trigger a concerted conformational change by the assembled dynamin, for vesicle detachment and also for recycling of dynamin for reutilization. guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) proline-arginine-rich domain Hepes column buffer dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 1,4-piperazinedethanesulfonic acid. Thus both the self-assembly and GTPase properties of dynamin are integral to its function. Compared to other members of the GTPase superfamily, dynamin has a relatively high intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis (13Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 733-735Google Scholar, 14Maeda K. Nakata T. Noda Y. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1181-1194Google Scholar, 15Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol.

Dynamin's GTPase activity can be stimulated in vitro by a diverse group of effectors which include microtubules (13Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 733-735Google Scholar), glutathione S-transferase fusions of SH3 domain-containing proteins (17Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Google Scholar, 18Herskovits J.S.C. Shpetner H.S. Burgess C.C. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Google Scholar), and acidic phospholipids (15Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Google Scholar). Each of these effectors binds to dynamin through its ~100-amino acid C-terminal proline-arginine-rich domain (PRD), and each is multivalent. The importance of multivalent interactions in stimulating dynamin GTPase activity was established using monoclonal antibodies directed against dynamin's PRD. In these experiments, the stimulatory activity of intact IgGs was enhanced by further cross-linking, while monovalent Fab fragments could not stimulate dynamin GTPase activity unless they were cross-linked (16Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Google Scholar). The finding that both microtubule- and phospholipid-stimulated dynamin GTPase activity shows strong cooperativity also suggested that dynamin-dynamin interactions were required for stimulated GTPase activity (19Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Google Scholar). Here we show that dynamin self-assembly in vitro stimulates GTPase activity in the absence of any effector molecules. GTP binding and hydrolysis, in turn, destabilize the dynamin assemblies, suggesting a cycle of GTP hydrolysis, disassembly, and reassembly. The ability of dynamin to stimulate its own GTPase activity is not dependent on a high affinity GTP binding site, since a mutant defective in GTP binding and hydrolysis can coassemble with and stimulate GTP hydrolysis by wild-type dynamin. Protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Boehringer Mannheim and calpain inhibitor I was obtained from Calbiochem. Serum-free medium, EX-CELL 401, was purchased from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS). Fetal calf serum and Fungizone solution were from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). The supplier of Macro-Prep High Q strong anion exchange support and Macro-Prep Ceramic Hydroxyapatite was Bio-Rad. [α-32P]GTP was from Amersham Corp. GTP and GDP were acquired from Sigma and GTPγS was from Boehringer Mannheim. Unless otherwise indicated, all other chemicals were reagent grade. Human neuronal dynamin (dynamin-1) and K44A dynamin-1 containing a lysine to alanine conversion at amino acid 44 (7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Google Scholar) were expressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells exactly as described previously (16Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Google Scholar). However, a new purification procedure was used. Cells were infected at 3-5 plaque-forming units/cell with high titer virus stocks and then harvested 65 h later by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and repelleted. The cell pellet obtained from a 0.5-liter culture was resuspended in 25 ml of Hepes column buffer (HCB, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT) containing 100 mM NaCl (referred to as HCB100), a protease inhibitor mixture tablet, and 1 mM PMSF. All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. Cells were homogenized by N2-cavitation at 500 p.s.i. for 25 min prior to slow release. The homogenate was diluted 2-fold in HCB0 (no NaCl) and then centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 60 min in a Beckman Ti60 rotor. The supernatant was collected. The supernatant was brought to 30%percnt; ammonium sulfate by slow addition of salt. After 10 min of slow stirring, the solution was centrifuged for 10 min in a Beckman JA-20 rotor at 10,000 × g. The pellet was gently resuspended using a loose fitting Dounce in 10 ml of HCB50 (50 mM NaCl) with protease inhibitors. The resuspended fraction was recentrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g to remove aggregated protein. The solubilized 30%percnt; NH2SO4 cut was then applied to a High-Q strong anion exchange (Bio-Rad) column (10 × 1.5 cm) preequilibrated in HCB50. The column was washed with 50 ml of HCB50 and then with 50 ml of HCB100. Dynamin was finally step eluted in a volume of about 10 ml of HCB250. Protease inhibitor mixture, 40 µM calpain inhibitor 1, and 1 mM PMSF were added to the pooled High Q eluate which was then brought to 5 mM CaCl2. The dynamin fraction was loaded onto a 10-ml Macro-Prep Ceramic Hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) preequilibrated with HCB250, 5 mM CaCl2. The column was washed with 30 ml of 200 mM KPO4 pH 7.2 and then eluted in 400 mM KPO4 (pH 7.2). K44A and wild-type dynamin-1 behaved identically during this procedure and yielded up to 15 mg of dynamin from 1 × 109 infected Sf9 cells. Purity was greater than 95%percnt; as judged by Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-PAGE. Aliquots were stored at -80°C in 400 mM KPO4 containing 1 mM DTT, 40 µM calpain inhibitor 1, and 1 mM PMSF. Dynamin was transferred to HCB150 or GTPase assay buffer referred to as PH buffer (20 mM Pipes, 20 mM Hepes, 2 mM MgCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.0), by overnight dialysis with two buffer changes. Spectra/Por 2 dialysis membrane tubing (Spectrum Medical Industries, Houston, TX) with a molecular weight cut-off of 12,000-14,000 or a framed dialysis membrane for a microdialyzer system 100 apparatus (Pierce) with a molecular weight cut-off of 8,000 were used with equivalent results. GTPase assays were performed in PH buffer with 1 mM DTT and 0.1%percnt; bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 20 µl, essentially as described elsewhere (7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Google Scholar, 16Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Google Scholar). The final ionic strength of the GTPase assay buffer was always adjusted to that of PH buffer and control experiments confirmed that addition of small amounts of HCB150 to GTPase assays, while maintaining final ionic strength, had no effect on GTPase activity. Reactions were initiated by the addition of GTP (0.1 µCi of [α-32P]GTP) (Amersham). 1.5-µl aliquots were removed at each time point and spotted onto cellulose polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography plates with fluorescent indicator (J. T. Baker, Inc.). Nucleotides were resolved by TLC in 1 M LiCl2, 2 M formic acid (1:1). Quantitation of GTP and GDP at each time point was performed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Rates of GTP hydrolysis were calculated from a minimum of five time points and expressed as the percent of GDP per GTP plus GDP. Dynamin self-assembly into oligomeric structures was assayed as described previously (9Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 384: 190-192Google Scholar). Dynamin at 2 mg/ml in HCB150 was diluted or dialyzed 8-fold into various buffer conditions on ice. Supernatant and pellet fractions were obtained after centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 15 min in a TLA100 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Dynamin in each fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE, on 7.5%percnt; acrylamide gels, using standard methods as described previously (16Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Google Scholar). Quantitation of dynamin was performed by scanning Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels on a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer and using Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant software to calculate relative intensities of dynamin in supernatant and pellet fractions. Standard curves of dynamin were analyzed to determine the optimal linear protein concentration sensitivity of the assay. We showed previously that purified dynamin self-assembles into sedimentable structures composed of rings and small stacks of rings upon dilution into low ionic strength buffers (9Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 384: 190-192Google Scholar). Interestingly, the GTPase activity of dynamin is routinely measured under low ionic strength conditions (13Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 733-735Google Scholar, 14Maeda K. Nakata T. Noda Y. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1181-1194Google Scholar, 15Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Google Scholar). We therefore used a sedimentation assay to determine whether dynamin self-assembly occurs under GTPase assay conditions. Thus, dynamin was diluted into GTPase assay buffer (referred to here as PH buffer, see “Experimental Procedures”) and subjected to sedimentation analysis as described previously (9Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 384: 190-192Google Scholar). The SDS-polyacrylamide gel in Fig. 1 (lanes a) shows that >95%percnt; of dynamin is found in the supernatant in the starting buffer, HCB150 which contains 150 mM NaCl. However, upon 8-fold dilution into PH buffer, >75%percnt; becomes sedimentable (Fig. 1b). The structures assembled by dynamin in PH buffer were indistinguishable from those described previously (9Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 384: 190-192Google Scholar) (data not shown). As reported previously (9Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 384: 190-192Google Scholar) self-assembly at low ionic strength does not require either the presence of guanine nucleotides or dynamin's high affinity GTP binding activity since the K44A mutant of dynamin defective in GTP binding and hydrolysis (7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Google Scholar) shows comparable self-assembly activity (Fig. 1, c and d). It had previously been shown that stimulated dynamin GTPase activity was highly cooperative (19Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Google Scholar). Given dynamin's ability to self-assemble under GTPase assay conditions, we examined the concentration dependence of dynamin's intrinsic GTPase activity. For this experiment stock solutions of dynamin were prepared in HCB150 and then diluted 8-fold into PH buffer at 4°C so that the final concentration of NaCl in the assay remained constant. GTPase assays were transferred to 37°C and initiated by addition of [α-32P]GTP. The kinetics of GTP hydrolysis were determined for each concentration of dynamin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The rate of GTP hydrolysis increased in a nonlinear fashion with increasing dynamin concentration (Fig. 2A). A plot of the specific activity of dynamin's intrinsic GTPase (Fig. 2B) gave a sigmoidal curve showing a sharp concentration dependence and reaching maximal specific activity at 2 µM dynamin. These data suggested that dynamin's intrinsic GTPase activity could be stimulated by self-assembly. While the trends shown in Fig. 2 were consistently obtained, we noted several experimental factors affecting dynamin's GTPase activity. For example, when dialysis was performed in the absence of DTT, higher specific activities were obtained at all concentrations of dynamin (not shown). When dynamin was dialyzed into buffer containing 100 mM NaCl (as opposed to 150 mM) higher specific activities were obtained at high concentrations of dynamin. Finally, preincubation of dynamin (for 30-90 min) after dilution into GTPase buffer resulted in higher specific activities at lower dynamin concentrations but did not affect specific activities at higher concentrations. This result probably reflects the slower kinetics of self-assembly at lower concentrations of dynamin. It should be noted that the high variation of intrinsic GTPase rates for dynamin reported in the literature, from as low as <1 min-1 (14Maeda K. Nakata T. Noda Y. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1181-1194Google Scholar, 18Herskovits J.S.C. Shpetner H.S. Burgess C.C. Vallee R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Google Scholar) to as high as 23 min-1 (15Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Google Scholar), probably reflect differences in protein handling and assay conditions. To further test the relationship between dynamin GTPase activity and self-assembly, dynamin was preassembled by dialysis into PH buffer (9Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 384: 190-192Google Scholar) and then assayed for intrinsic GTPase activity upon dilution into PH buffer containing increasing concentrations of NaCl. Other samples were diluted in parallel and subjected to sedimentation analysis. As can be seen, dynamin's intrinsic GTPase activity (Fig. 3A) decreased with increasing salt concentrations in parallel with the disassembly of sedimentable structures (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that dynamin-dynamin interactions are important for stimulated GTPase activity. Does the stimulation of dynamin GTPase activity in assembled structures require that the neighboring dynamin molecules are themselves able to bind and hydrolyze GTP? To address this question, wild-type dynamin was coassembled with increasing amounts of a mutant dynamin (designated K44A) that is defective in GTP binding and hydrolysis by virtue of a point mutation in the first conserved GTP binding element (7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1 (lanes 7 and 8), K44A dynamin was able to self-assemble into structures indistinguishable from wild-type dynamin (see also Hinshaw and Schmid (9Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 384: 190-192Google Scholar)). However, as shown in Fig. 4, A and B (open circles), the K44A mutant on its own had little or no intrinsic GTPase activity, nor could its GTPase activity be stimulated by microtubules (not shown, but see Damke et al. (7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Google Scholar)). Nonetheless, when K44A dynamin was allowed to coassemble with a fixed and small amount of wild-type dynamin during dialysis into PH buffer, these mixtures showed greatly stimulated GTPase activity dependent on the concentration of K44A dynamin (Fig. 4, closed triangles). In fact, the K44A mutant appeared to be even more effective than wild-type dynamin at stimulating specific GTPase activity. The maximum specific activity of wild-type dynamin alone under these assay conditions was 9.4 min-1 (Fig. 2B), while when coassembled with K44A mutant, wild-type dynamin hydrolyzed GTP at a rate of ~20 min-1 (Fig. 4B). In an effort to determine why wild-type dynamin showed greater GTPase activity when coassembled with the K44A mutant dynamin than with itself, we examined the effects of GTP on the stability of the assembled dynamin structures. The experiment in Fig. 5 shows that incubation of preassembled wild-type dynamin (lanes a) with either GTP (lanes b-d) or GTPγS (lanes e and f) destabilized the sedimentable structures, releasing dynamin into the supernatant. In fact, GTPγS was more potent than GTP. A 58%percnt; release of sedimentable dynamin occurred in the presence of 10 µM GTPγS (lanes e), while only a 42%percnt; release occurred following incubation in 250 µM GTP (lanes c). GDP, however, was considerably less effective at destabilizing assembled dynamin with only 32%percnt; released at 1 mM GDP (lanes i). The observation that nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues were at least as effective as GTP in destabilizing dynamin assemblies allowed us to compare the relative stability of preassembled K44A dynamin to wild-type dynamin in the presence of GTPγS. In this way, the differential hydrolysis of GTP by wild-type and K44A dynamin would not affect the results. The data in Fig. 6 shows the effect of increasing concentrations of GTPγS on the stability of preassembled wild-type dynamin (open squares), K44A mutant dynamin (open circles) or a 4:1 (K44A:wild type) mixture of the two (closed triangles) as assessed by sedimentation analysis. As expected, assembled K44A dynamin required ~20-fold more GTPγS to trigger its disassembly than did wild-type dynamin, reflecting its greatly reduced affinity for GTP (7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Google Scholar). Moreover, when wild-type dynamin was coassembled with the K44A mutant at the ratio that gave near-maximum stimulation of GTPase activity (see Fig. 4B), these coassembled structures were as resistant to GTPγS-induced disassembly as the K44A mutant itself. We have shown that dynamin's intrinsic GTPase activity is significantly enhanced under conditions that favor self-assembly of dynamin into rings and helical stacks of rings. This directly confirms previous suggestions based on the cooperative behavior of dynamin's GTPase activity when stimulated by acidic phospholipids and microtubules (19Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Google Scholar), that dynamin-dynamin interactions were key to regulating its GTPase activity. Moreover, we have shown that stimulation of dynamin GTPase does not depend on the high affinity binding or hydrolysis of GTP by neighboring dynamin molecules. While the nature of the dynamin-dynamin interactions required for stimulated GTPase activity remain to be determined, we have identified dynamin as the first effector of its GTPase activity known to be physiologically relevant. In this regard it is of interest to note that all of the suppressors of shibire so far identified through genetic analysis are intra-allelic (20Ramaswami M. Rao S. van der Bliek A. Kelly R.B. Krishnan K.S. J. Neurogenet. 1993; 9: 73-87Google Scholar), consistent with the suggestion the dynamin-dynamin interactions are critical to its in vivo function. Interestingly, we also show that GTP binding destabilizes structures assembled by purified dynamin under low ionic strength conditions. This suggests that the activated rates of GTP hydrolysis that occur at higher concentrations of dynamin reflect a continuing cycle of assembly, GTP hydrolysis and disassembly. That the K44A mutant is even more effective at stimulating GTP hydrolysis rates by wild-type dynamin can be explained by the fact that these coassembled structures are resistant to destabilization by GTP binding. In contrast, it is unlikely that intramolecular dynamin interactions are absolutely required for the low basal rates of GTP hydrolysis seen in dilute solutions of dynamin for several reasons. First, if collisions between individual dynamin molecules were required for GTP hydrolysis, then dynamin's GTPase activity would remain highly concentration dependent even under dilute conditions. Instead, we find that the rate of GTP hydrolysis obtained at concentrations below an apparent threshold for dynamin assembly (i.e. <500 nM) is concentration independent. Second, the basal rate of dynamin GTPase observed under high ionic strength conditions that disfavor self-assembly are also concentration-independent (not shown). Finally, limited proteolysis of dynamin removes the PRD and prevents dynamin assembly (9Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 384: 190-192Google Scholar). Truncated dynamin molecules exhibit the same intrinsic GTPase activity as intact dynamin (15Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Google Scholar, 16Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Google Scholar), 2D. E. Warnock and S. L. Schmid, unpublished results. and this “basal” GTPase rate is independent of protein concentration.2 Our current working model for dynamin function (1Baba T. Damke H. Hinshaw J.E. Ikeda K. Schmid S.L. Warnock D.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 235-242Google Scholar, 9Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 384: 190-192Google Scholar) suggests that dynamin is targeted to and evenly distributed on clathrin lattices in its unoccupied or GDP-bound form. GTP-GDP exchange then triggers dynamin to redistribute from the clathrin lattice and to assemble into rings forming helical collars at the necks of invaginated coated pits. These collars function to form constricted coated pits (7Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Google Scholar, 8Schmid S.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 145-148Google Scholar). Finally, GTP hydrolysis by dynamin is required, perhaps to trigger a concerted conformational change by the assembled dynamin, for vesicle detachment. Dynamin disassembles at this stage for recycling and reutilization. Many aspects of this early model need to be tested and confirmed. In particular, consistent with dynamin's membership in the GTPase superfamily of proteins, we assume that conformational changes triggered by GTP binding and hydrolysis affect dynamin's interaction with as yet unidentified partners required for membrane binding, self-assembly under physiological conditions and other aspects of coated vesicle budding. Key to elucidating dynamin's function will be an understanding of its GTPase cycle. In our initial studies, reported here, we have identified properties of dynamin GTPase activity in vitro some of which are consistent, others inconsistent with our current working model. For example, the finding that dynamin GTPase activity is highest when dynamin is assembled into rings or helical stacks of rings is consistent with GTP hydrolysis being triggered after collar assembly. Preassembled dynamin rings can hydrolyze GTP at rates in excess of 10 min-1, and if these rings are stabilized, for example by coassembly with the K44A mutant, rates can increase to 20 min-1. These rates are sufficient to account for the apparently short-lived nature of the constricted coated pit intermediate. The finding that GTP hydrolysis releases soluble dynamin from assembled structures is also consistent with our proposal that dynamin is recycled for reutilization at this stage. In contrast, we find that dynamin self-assembly in vitro does not require guanine nucleotides, yet GTP appears to be required in vivo for the redistribution of dynamin from clathrin lattices and its assembly into collars. Unlike unassembled dynamin, dynamin collars are spatially segregated from the clathrin lattice (1Baba T. Damke H. Hinshaw J.E. Ikeda K. Schmid S.L. Warnock D.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 235-242Google Scholar, 11Takei K. McPherson P. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Google Scholar). We speculate that GTP/GDP exchange would trigger a conformation change in dynamin, as it does for other members of the GTPase superfamily. The GTP-induced conformational change may be necessary in vivo to alter dynamin interactions with partners on the clathrin lattice releasing it for assembly. Assembled dynamin is destabilized by GTP or GTPγS in vitro, yet GTPγS stabilizes helical dynamin stacks triggering their exaggerated assembly on synaptosomal membrane fractions (11Takei K. McPherson P. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Google Scholar). These differences suggest that other factors may be required in vivo to regulate both dynamin assembly and disassembly and that these factors might be membrane associated. It will be essential to identify components that interact with dynamin in vivo in order to determine their role in regulating dynamin targeting, GTPase activity, and assembly. The assays developed here will be important in testing the function and determining the mechanism of action of both dynamin and its partners."

In eukaryotes, AA serves both a structural role as a component of cellular membranes, and a critical functional role by participating in a variety of receptor/agonist-mediated signaling cascades (8Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191Google Scholar). The latter role is a consequence of regio- and stereoselective oxygenations of AA that is utilized by mammalian cells to transduce the signal (8Smith W.L. Am. J.

The transduced chemical information is then decoded either by receptor mediated processes or, alternatively, by the direct effects of the oxygenated products on metabolic pathways (8Smith W.L. Am. J.

In addition to prostaglandin synthases and lipoxygenases, well recognized members of the AA cascade, the contribution of microsomal P450 to the metabolism of endogenous AA pools is now well established (9Capdevila J.H.

Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 443Google Scholar). Eukaryotic P450s oxidize AA by one or more types of reactions: 1) allylic oxidation to generate six different regioisomeric hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids containing a cis,trans-conjugated dienol, 2) hydroxylation at sp3 carbons near or at the methyl terminus to generate 16-, 17-, 18-, 19-, or 20-OH-AA, and 3) olefinic bond epoxidation to generate four regioisomeric EETs. While the physiological significance of allylic oxidation remains obscure, products of hydroxylation and olefinic bond epoxidation reactions display a variety of potent biological activities and have been implicated in processes ranging from hormonal signaling to the pathophysiology of hypertension (9Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Estabrook R.W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 731-736Google Scholar, 10McGiff J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 31: 339-369Google Scholar, 11Oliw E.H. Prog.

As with other metabolites of the AA cascade, e.g. prostanoids and leukotrienes, regio- and stereochemical features define biological activity and/or potency. Thus, understanding active site topology and the structural determinants of asymmetric catalysis by P450s are prerequisites for modifying their mechanism of action, and ultimately, for rational pharmacological intervention. Studies using microsomal fractions, and/or solubilized and purified mammalian P450 isoforms have demonstrated that the hemoprotein controls the regio- and stereoselectivities of oxidation of AA in an isoform-specific fashion at three different levels: 1) the type of reaction catalyzed, i.e. epoxidation to form EETs by CYP2B and CYP2C isoforms (9Capdevila J.H.

These processes are all the more remarkable since AA is an unbiased, acyclic molecule with high rotational freedom, and it is epoxidized by several mammalian P450 isoforms with unprecedented stereoselectivity (9Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Estabrook R.W. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 731-736Google Scholar, 11Oliw E.H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1994; 33: 329-354Google Scholar, 13Capdevila J.H. Zeldin D. Makita K. Karara A. Falck J.R.

As a guide to the protein structural determinants of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism by P450s, we describe herein the highly regio- and stereoselective metabolism of AA by recombinant P450BM-3, one of the four soluble P450s for which an atomic structure has been determined (16Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Google Scholar, 17Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Google Scholar, 18Hasemann C.A. Ravichandran K.G. Peterson J.A.

Based on these results and similar analyses done with the AA cogeners EPA and ETA, we propose a model of the active site that accounts for the asymmetric catalysis by P450BM-3. The fatty acids were obtained from NuCheck Prep, Inc. All other chemicals were obtained in the purest form available from Sigma. The original plasmid, containing the gene encoding P450BM-3, was a gift from Dr. A. Fulco (Department of Biochemistry, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). In preparation for our studies of the mechanism of P450BM-3, we constructed a new expression plasmid that contained only the gene encoding P450BM-3 and no extraneous B. megaterium DNA. We had previously constructed a plasmid for the expression of the heme domain of P450BM-3 and a construct from this project, pIBI-BMP2 (20Boddupalli S.S. Oster T. Estabrook R.W. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10375-10380Google Scholar), was linearized with SalI. Likewise, a vector had been constructed for the expression of the reductase domain of P450BM-3, pIBI-BMR (21Oster T. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22718-22725Google Scholar). A 1.78-kilobase pair fragment from SalI-digested pIBI-BMR was recovered and ligated into the linearized pIBI-BMP2, giving pIBI-BM3. The sequence of the gene encoding P450BM-3 in this plasmid was confirmed. The plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli strain DH5α. The protein was overexpressed and purified from these cells using published procedures (5Boddupalli S.S. Estabrook R.W. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4233-4239Google Scholar). The concentration of the purified protein was estimated from the difference absorbance spectrum of the carbonyl complex of the ferrous form versus the ferrous form using the molar absorptivity of 91 mM-1cm-1 for the wavelength pair of 450 versus 490 nm (22Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Google Scholar). The substrate binding spectra used for the determination of spectral binding constants (Ks), were recorded with a Hewlett Packard diode array spectrophotometer maintained at 25°C. The absorbance data for substrate binding were analyzed with the program Microsoft Excel.© The rates of P450BM-3-dependent oxygen and NADPH utilization were measured using 20-50 nM solutions of the enzyme in 50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 µM fatty acid. After a 5-min preincubation, reactions were started by addition of NADPH. Oxygen concentration was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode instrument (Yellow Springs Instrument Co.). NADPH concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (ϵ = 6.22 mM-1 cm-1). For product quantification and structural characterization, incubations were performed at 30°C under atmospheric air and with vigorous mixing. Reaction mixtures in 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl, 8 mM sodium isocitrate, isocitrate dehydrogenase (1.0 IU/ml), dilauroyl phosphatidyl choline (0.05 µg/ml), and P450BM-3 (2-10 nM, final concentration) were incubated 2.5 min prior to the addition of the sodium salts of either AA, EPA, or ETA (25 mM each in 0.05 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 8.0) to final concentrations of 50-100 µM each. After 1 min, reactions were started by the addition of NADPH (1 mM, final concentration). At different time points, aliquots were withdrawn, and the organic soluble products were extracted three times with equal volumes of ethyl ether containing HOAc (0.05%, v/v). After solvent evaporation under a stream of nitrogen, the products were resolved by RP-HPLC on a 5-µm Dynamax Microsorb C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Rainin Instruments Co., Woburn, MA) using a linear solvent gradient from 49.9% CH3CN, 49.9% H2O, 0.1% HOAc to 99.9% CH3CN, 0.1% HOAc over 40 min at 1 ml/min. Products were quantified by on-line liquid scintillation using a Radiomatic Flo-One β-Detector (Radiomatic Instruments, Tampa, FL). The identification of 18-OH-AA and of 14,15-EET was done using published methodology (23Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A.

Basic Life Sci. 1988; 49: 945-949Google Scholar) and confirmed with synthetic standards. Synthetic 16-, 17-, and 18-OH-AAs were resolved by normal phase HPLC on a 5-µm Dynamax Microsorb Silica column (4.6 × 250 mm, Rainin Instruments) using an isocratic solvent mixture composed of 0.4% 2-propanol, 0.1% HOAc, 99.5% hexane at 2 ml/min (Rt ~ 31.5, 33.1, and 36.5 min for 17-, 18-, and 16-OH-AA, respectively). Synthetic 19- and 20-OH-AAs were resolved by NP-HPLC as above using a solvent mixture of 1% 2-propanol, 0.1% HOAc, 98.9% hexane at 3 ml/min (Rt ~ 14.6 and 20.8 min for 19- and 20-OH-AA, respectively). The enantiomers of methyl 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoate were resolved by chiral phase HPLC as described previously (24Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Google Scholar). For the characterization of EPA metabolites, the organic soluble material extracted from solutions containing [1-14C]EPA (100 µM final concentration, 0.1 µCi/µmol), 5 nM P450BM-3, and 1 mM NADPH was resolved by RP-HPLC as described. The radioactive fraction eluting from the HPLC column with the retention time of authentic 17,18-epoxy-EPA (18.7 min) was collected batchwise and further characterized. To confirm the epoxide nature of the metabolite, an aliquot of the purified material (2-5 µg) was incubated, under an argon atmosphere and with constant mixing, with 0.25 ml of a mixture containing 20% EtOH, 40% H2O, and 40% glacial HOAc. After 12 h at room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with 1 ml of 0.1 M KCl and extracted twice with equal volumes of ethyl ether. The resulting product co-eluted in RP-HPLC with synthetic vic-17,18-dihydroxy-5, 8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (Rt ≈ 10 min) and, after derivatization to the corresponding TMS ether, PFB ester, showed a NICI/GC/MS fragmentation pattern identical to that of an authentic standard (Fig. 1A). For regiochemical analysis, an aliquot of the hydrated epoxide (5 µg) was hydrogenated over PtO2, derivatized to the corresponding PFB ester (24Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Google Scholar), and purified by SiO2 chromatography. The dry residue was dissolved in 200 µl of NaIO4 (10 mg/ml in 70% CH3OH) and, after 2 h at 50°C, the product was extracted into hexane and purified by RP-HPLC using a linear solvent gradient from 49.9% CH3CN, 49.9% H2O, 0.1% HOAc, to 99.9% CH3CN, 0.1% HOAc over 40 min at 1 ml/min (Rt~ 43 min). The purified aldehyde, resulting from oxidative cleavage of the vic-diol precursor, was dried under a stream of N2, mixed with 200 µl of 0.5% solution of methoxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine (Pierce), incubated 3 h at 30°C, extracted into hexane, and then characterized by NICI/GC/MS (Fig. 1B). For structural analysis, the organic soluble products extracted from solutions containing [1-14C]ETA (100 µM, final concentration, 0.2 µCi/µmol), 2 nM P450BM-3, and 1 mM NADPH were purified by RP-HPLC as above. The radioactive material eluting from the RP-HPLC column between 18 and 20 min was collected batchwise and, after solvent evaporation, resolved into fractions a, b, and c (Rt ~ 16.9, 23.1, and 37.1 min, respectively for a, b, and c) by NP-HPLC on a 5-µm Dynamax Microsorb Silica column (4.6 × 250 mm) using an isocratic solvent mixture composed of 0.5% 2-propanol, 0.1% HOAc, 99.4% hexane at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. After catalytic hydrogenation and derivatization to the corresponding PFB esters, fractions a, b, and c were characterized by NP-HPLC on the above silica column using an isocratic solvent mixture composed of 0.2% 2-propanol, 99.8% hexane at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. In this chromatographic system, the PFB esters of hydrogenated a, b, and c (Rt ~ 20, 23, and 35 min, respectively) co-eluted with the PFB esters of synthetic 17-, 18-, and 19-hydroxyeicosanoic acid, respectively. The PFB esters of hydrogenated a, b, and c were further characterized by NICI/GC/MS. To a room temperature mixture of synthetic methyl 18-hydroxyeicosatetraenoate (1.5 mg) (27Falck J.R. Lumin S. Lee S.-G. Heckmann B. Mioskowski C. Karara A. Capdevila J.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1992; 33: 4893-4896Google Scholar), R-(+)-α-methoxy-α-trifluoromethylphenylacetic acid (1.5 mg), and dimethylaminopyridine (0.2 mg) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (1 ml) was added 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (1.5 mg) in one portion with stirring. After 12 h, the solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was purified by PTLC (SiO2: 20% EtOAc/hexane, RF ≈ 0.59). A sample of enzymatically derived 18-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (0.8 mg) was esterified with excess diazomethane in Et2O for 1 h prior to derivatization exactly as described above. The individual Mosher esters were further purified by HPLC using a Dynamax Microsorb Silica column (4.6 × 250 mm) isocratically eluted with 0.35% EtOH, 99.65% hexane at 4 ml/min with UV monitoring at 210 nm. Comparative analysis by co-injection on a Chiracel OD HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm, J. T. Baker Inc.) isocratically eluted with 0.2% 2-propanol, 99.8% hexane at 2 ml/min with UV monitoring showed the 18(S)-isomer eluted with a retention time of 6.6 min, whereas the 18(R)-isomer and the enzymatically derived product co-eluted with a retention time of 5.8 min. A stream of O3 in oxygen was passed for 2 h through a solution of enzymatically generated 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (1.87 mg) in 90% CH3OH, 10% CH2Cl2 cooled to 0°C. NaBH4 (2 mg) was added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature. After 30 min, the reaction mixture was diluted with Et2O (2 ml) and H2O (2 ml). The organic phase was separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted once more with Et2O. The combined organic phases were evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was dried azeotropically with anhydrous benzene, then dissolved in dry pyridine (100 µl) to which was added benzoyl chloride (15 µl). After 12 h, the reaction mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (2 ml), and a saturated aqueous solution of CuSO4 (300 µl) was added to effect phase separation. The organic layer was collected and concentrated in vacuo, and the residue was purified by PTLC (15% EtOAc, 85% hexane, RF ~ 0.26) using standards of synthetic epoxy-benzoate in adjacent lanes as guides to the location of the enzymatically derived 3,4-epoxyhexan-1-yl benzoate. A chiral standard of the 3,4-epoxyhexan-1-yl benzoate was prepared by Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation of (3Z)-hexen-1-ol as described previously (28Rossiter B.E. Sharpless K.B. J. Org. Chem. 1984; 49: 3707-3711Google Scholar) affording (3R,4S)-epoxyhexan-1-ol, [α]22D+7.27° (c 1.85, CHCl3), as a colorless oil in 45% yield. The epoxy-alcohol (58 mg, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in dry pyridine (1 ml) and cooled to 0°C, and benzoyl chloride (58 µl, 0.75 mmol, 1.5 equivalent) was added. After stirring at room temperature for 12 h, the reaction mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (10 ml), washed with saturated aqueous CuSO4 solution (3 × 5 ml), brine (5 ml), dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated in vacuo. The residue was purified by PTLC (SiO2: 15% EtOAc, 85% hexane, RF ≈ 0.26) to give the epoxy-benzoate (98 mg, 100%) as a colorless oil. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 250 MHz): δ 1.06 (t, 3H, 6.6 Hz), 1.49-1.69 (m, 2H), 1.90-2.14 (m, 2H), 2.90-2.98 (m, 1H), 3.09-3.18 (m, 1H), 4.53 (t, 2H, 6.6 Hz), 7.46 (t, 2H, 7.7 Hz), 7.56 (apparent t, 1H, 7.7 Hz), 8.07 (d, 2H, 7.7 Hz). The (3S,4R)-enantiomer was obtained analogously. Comparisons using a Chiracel OC HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm) eluted isocratically with 0.2% 2-PrOH, 0.1% EtOH, 99.7% hexane at 1.1 ml/min with UV monitoring at 210 nm showed the (3R,4S)-isomer had a retention time of 58 min, whereas the (3S,4R)-enantiomer and the biologically derived sample co-eluted with a retention time of 45 min. Samples were dissolved in dodecane and analyzed by NICI/GC/MS on a Nermag R1010C quadrupole instrument interfaced to a Varian Vista Gas chromatograph utilizing He and CH4 as carrier and reagent gases, respectively. Splitless injections were made onto a 30-m SPB-1 fused silica capillary column (0.32-mm inner diameter, 0.25-µm coating thickness, Supelco Inc. Bellefonte, PA). After 1 min at 100°C, the oven temperature was raised to 300°C at 10°C/min. The rate of fatty acid oxidation by P450BM-3 can be easily measured either polarographically using an oxygen electrode or spectrophotometrically monitoring absorbance changes at 340 nm. Seen in Fig. 2 is an oxygen electrode trace of O2 consumption during the NADPH-dependent metabolism of AA by P450BM-3. The order of addition of reactants is crucial, i.e. NADPH must be added last to avoid inactivating the reductase domain of P450BM-3 (3Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7160-7169Google Scholar, 29Sevrioukova I.F. Peterson J.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 562-572Google Scholar). During the first few seconds after addition of NADP, the turnover number of P450BM-3 is 3.5 µmol of O2 consumed/min/nmol, but decreases as oxidized products accumulate (Fig. 2). In experiments not shown here, the rate of NADPH oxidation, measured at 340 nm, was approximately the same as the rate of oxygen consumption per mol of P450 per min indicating a tight coupling of NADPH oxidation, O2 consumption and substrate oxidation. Within the first 30 s of incubation, the rates of AA utilization and product formation began to decrease showing the lack of a clear linear relationship between product formation and incubation time. As the rate of AA oxidation decreased, the recovery of polyoxygenated products, derived from secondary oxygenations, increased concomitantly, and became predominant 2-3 min after initiation. When limiting amounts of AA were added, as shown in Fig. 2, the ratio of O2 consumed per mol of AA added was approximately 2, indicating that fatty acid polyoxygenation had occurred as shown for palmitic acid (5Boddupalli S.S. Estabrook R.W. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4233-4239Google Scholar, 7Boddupalli S.S. Pramanik B.C. Slaughter C.A. Estabrook R.W. Peterson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 20-28Google Scholar). The limited solubility of AA made impractical attempts to increase its concentration, and thus prolong enzyme-substrate saturation. The rates of product formation shown in Table I were obtained at 30°C and after a 30 s incubation, and are approximations of the initial velocities. They are useful only for comparative purposes.TABLE I.Reaction rates and spectral binding constants of P450BM-3 using various substratesSubstrateReaction rateaReaction rates in µmols of product formed/min/nmol of P450BM-3.Spectral binding constant, KsµMAA3.2 ± 0.41.2 ± 0.1EPA1.4 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.5ETA2.9 ± 0.1NDbNot determined.a Reaction rates in µmols of product formed/min/nmol of P450BM-3.b Not determined.

To address this question, a C-terminal truncation mutant of CD36 was made by introducing a stop codon just upstream of the C-terminal transmembrane domain. This mutant was found membrane-bound when expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, indicating that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain serves as a transmembrane anchor, and thus supporting a CD36 topology with two transmembrane domains.

Here, we demonstrate that activity is reconstituted in the absence of p47phox when high concentrations of p67phox and Rac are used. Vmax values were the same in the presence or absence of p47phox, yet p47phox increases the affinity of both p67phox and Rac for the oxidase complex by nearly 2 orders of magnitude. p67phox-(1-246), a truncated form of the protein which eliminates SH3 domains involved in binding to p47phox, also supports superoxide generation, both in the presence and absence of p47phox, providing further evidence for p47phox independent activity. In the absence of p47phox, p67phox-(1-246) binds to the NADPH oxidase complex 3-fold more tightly than does native p67phox, indicating that the C terminus contains a region which masks binding to the oxidase complex. Results indicate that p47phox does not play a direct role in regulating electron transfer. Rather, its function is to serve as an adaptor protein to enhance the assembly of the other cytosolic components with the flavocytochrome and possibly to unmask a binding region in the N terminus of p67phox by binding to its C-terminal domains. p67phox and/or Rac play a more direct role in regulating electron transfer.

Rather, its function is to serve as an adaptor protein to enhance the assembly of the other cytosolic components with the flavocytochrome and possibly to unmask a binding region in the N terminus of p67phox by binding to its C-terminal domains. p67phox and/or Rac play a more direct role in regulating electron transfer. During the respiratory burst, neutrophils and other phagocytic cells produce superoxide and other reduced oxygen species that participate in microbial killing (1Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 43-47Google Scholar). The multicomponent NADPH oxidase catalyzes the enzymatic reduction of oxygen to produce superoxide. Upon activation, cytosolic components p47phox, 1The abbreviations used are: phoxphagocytic oxidaseGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiophosphate)PIL-α-phosphatidylinositolSMsphingomyelin. p67phox (2Clark R.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Google Scholar) to membrane where they bind directly or indirectly in a multicomponent complex with flavocytochrome b558. The flavocytochrome b558 contains all the prosthetic groups necessary for activity, FAD, two hemes, a consensus sequence for pyridine nucleotide binding (5Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Google Scholar, 6Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C. Rosen H. Scrace G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 781-788Google Scholar), but catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to superoxide only when assembled with the cytosolic components. Individuals with genetic deficiencies or mutations in p47phox, p67phox, or one of the subunits of cytochrome b558 (gp91phox and p22phox) exhibit chronic granulomatous disease, a condition marked by frequent infections as a result of the inability of neutrophils to generate superoxide and kill bacteria (7Smith R.M. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1991; 77: 673-683Google Scholar, 8Clark R.A. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 161: 1140-1147Google Scholar). In addition to the above components which were identified based on their absence in chronic granulomatous disease, Rac was purified from macrophages (9Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Google Scholar) and neutrophils (10Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M.

NADPH oxidase activity can be reconstituted using purified p47phox, p67phox, Rac, and cytochrome b558 along with an anionic amphiphile such as arachidonate plus the stable GTP analog GTPγS (11Abo A.

Both in vivo and in vitro, p47phox translocates to the cytochrome independent of other cytosolic factors (13Okamura N. Babior B.M. Mayo L.A. Peveri P. Smith R.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin.

Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2765-2774Google Scholar). However, significant p67phox translocation requires p47phox, both in vivo and in vitro (14Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8624-8631Google Scholar, 15Tyagi S.R. Neckelmann N. Uhlinger D.J. Burnham D.N. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2765-2774Google Scholar, 16Heyworth P.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 83-88Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that p67phox binding to the oxidase complex occurs indirectly through its binding to p47phox. Such a model would account for the failure of p67phox to translocate to the membrane in the absence of p47phox. However, in vitro kinetic evidence suggests that p67phox can bind independently of p47phox (21Uhlinger D. Taylor K. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22095-22098Google Scholar), implying the presence of one or more additional binding sites. In support of this interpretation, deletion of a p47phox binding region on p67phox does not eliminate the ability of p67phox to activate superoxide generation (22de Mendez I. Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Google Scholar). Also, p67phox binds directly to Rac, based on blotting and yeast two-hybrid assays (20Dorseuil O. Reibel L. Bokoch G. Camonis J. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 83-88Google Scholar, 23Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-532Google Scholar, 24Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Google Scholar). The function of the cytosolic factors in regulating electron flow from NADPH to oxygen is poorly understood. According to one proposal, p67phox and p47phox have distinct roles in controlling electron flux; it has been proposed that p67phox regulates the transfer of electrons from NADPH for reduction of the flavin, while p47phox controls electron flow between the flavin and heme groups (25Cross A. Curnutte J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6543-6548Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that when high concentrations of the other cytosolic factors are used, p47phox is not required to elicit high rates of superoxide generation. Rather, p47phox serves as an adaptor protein to enhance the binding of other cytosolic components to the oxidase complex and does not itself have a role in regulating electron flux within the oxidase complex. Hespan (6.2% hetastarch in 0.9% NaCl) was obtained from American Hospital Supply Corp. Lymphocyte separation medium (6.2% Ficoll, 9.4% sodium diatrizoate) was purchased from Organon Tekniker. NADPH, FAD, cytochrome c (type IV horse heart), octyl glucoside, cholic acid (Sigma Ultra), and GTPγS were purchased from Sigma. Glutathione Sepharose was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Human neutrophils were isolated from healthy donors and purified according to Bowman et al. (26Bowman E. Uhlinger D. Lambeth D. Balch W.E. Der C. Hall A. Methods in Enzymology: Small GRPases and Their Regulators. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 246-256Google Scholar) after informed consent was obtained. Plasma membranes were isolated as described previously (27Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4161-4168Google Scholar). Cytochrome b558 was solubilized with cholate and octyl glucoside and purified to a specific heme content greater than 6 nmol of heme/mg of protein using several column chromatographic steps as described previously (6Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C. Rosen H. Scrace G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 781-788Google Scholar). Cytochrome b558 was incorporated into phospholipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylethanolamine:PI:SM:cholesterol in a 4:2:1:3:3 mass ratio (28Nisimoto Y. Otsuka-Murakami H. Lambeth D. J. Biol.

Rac was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase protein and purified using glutathione- coupled Sephadex followed by thrombin cleavage as described previously (27Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4161-4168Google Scholar). Recombinant p47phox and p67phox were produced in insect cells and purified as described by Uhlinger et al. (14Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

The cDNA for the truncated p67phox (amino acids 1-246)-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was a gift from Alan Hall. Protein was expressed as with Rac above, except p67phox-(1-246) was eluted with glutathione according to Diekmann et al. (23Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-532Google Scholar) and dialyzed to remove free glutathione. All proteins were purified to >90% homogeneity. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (30Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Superoxide generation was measured by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c as described previously (31Burnham D.N. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17550-17559Google Scholar) using a Thermomax Kinetic Microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Rac, preloaded with a 5-fold molar excess of GTPγS for 15 min at 25°C in the absence of MgCl2 (27Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4161-4168Google Scholar), was combined with p47phox, p67phox, 10 nM cytochrome b558, and 1 µM FAD followed by activation with 40 µM arachidonate in 50 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM EGTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, as described in Rotrosen et al. (12Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Katkin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14256-14260Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 25°C for 5 min followed by addition of 200 µM NADPH and 200 µM cytochrome c. An extinction coefficient at 550 nm of 21 mM-1 cm-1 was used to calculate the quantity of cytochrome c reduced (32Lambeth J.D. Burnham D.N. Tyagi S.R. J. Biol.

The theoretical lines through the data shown in the figures were calculated using a nonlinear least squares fit of the data using the Michaelis-Menten equation and plotted with Sigma Plot. Kinetic parameters were calculated using Enzfitter with the data in Figs. 2, 3, and 4 and reported as Vmax and EC50 (effective concentration at 50% of Vmax).Fig. 3Concentration dependence of truncated p67phox in the presence and absence of p47phox. 10 nM cytochrome b558, 2 µM Rac, and either 213 nM p47phox (A) or no p47phox (B) were added along with the indicated concentration of truncated p67phox, and the rate of superoxide generation was measured.

Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Google Scholar, 12Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Katkin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14256-14260Google Scholar). As shown in the left half of Fig. 1 (filled bars), when relatively low concentrations of cytosolic proteins are used (i.e. submicromolar concentrations similar to those used in previous studies), p47phox, p67phox, and Rac all are needed to obtain a high rate of superoxide generation. These experiments used concentrations similar to those used in earlier studies and confirm published results. In contrast, when high concentrations of p67phox (6 µM) and Rac (2 µM) were used, a high rate of superoxide generation was seen even in the absence of p47phox (Fig. 1, open bars). p67phox and Rac are required, however. Even in the presence of very high concentrations of the other two components, little or no activity was seen when either of these components was omitted. Activity was specific for these NADPH oxidase components even at high concentrations. RhoA (2 µM), another member of the Rho family of small GTPases which is 59% identical to Rac, failed to replace Rac1 in this system. It was also possible that at high concentrations, p67phox was substituting for p47phox. Although these two proteins show rather low sequence identity overall (18%), they both contain two SH3 domains. It was therefore possible that the SH3 domains of p67phox at high concentrations were functioning in place of those of one of the cytosolic factors. Like p47phox and p67phox, Grb2 contains two SH3 domains. High concentrations of Grb2 (10 µM) failed to substitute for either p67phox or p47phox when normal concentrations of the remaining cytosolic factors were used (data not shown). p67phox-(1-246), a truncated version of p67phox lacking both SH3 domains, was also active at high concentrations in the NADPH oxidase assay system in the absence of p47phox (see below), indicating that the SH3 domains of p67phox were not substituting for those of p47phox. To determine the extent to which the affinity for p67phox is influenced by p47phox, the concentration dependence of p67phox was determined in the presence and absence of p47phox (Fig. 2). The EC50 for p67phox was decreased 66-fold by p47phox (Table I). These results are consistent with our earlier report in which the EC50 value for p67phox varied inversely with p47phox concentration (21Uhlinger D. Taylor K. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22095-22098Google Scholar), except that the earlier study failed to achieve sufficiently high concentrations of p67phox to observe activity that was independent of p47phox. Despite the large change in p67phox EC50 values, the Vmax values were the same within experimental error (Table I). The effect of p47phox on the EC50 for p67phox is in agreement with previous studies indicating a role for p47phox in localizing p67phox to the NADPH oxidase complex (18Leto T. Adams A. Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Google Scholar). However, the generation of superoxide in the absence of p47phox clearly demonstrates that p67phox has one or more additional binding sites for the oxidase complex which is (are) independent of p47phox.TABLE IEffect of p47phox on kinetic parameters of Rac and p67phoxEC50VmaxnMnmol/min/pmol cytochromep67phox+p47phox24 ± 8113 ± 8-p47phox1590 ± 95132 ± 7Truncated p67phox+p47phox100 ± 2077 ± 22-p47phox460 ± 9032 ± 5.8Rac+p47phox47 ± 11133 ± 15-p47phox1613 ± 760149 ± 26 Open table in a new tab Further evidence for p47phox independent assembly of p67phox to the NADPH oxidase complex is seen in Fig. 3. p67phox-(1-246), which lacks both SH3 domains, was used in place of full-length p67phox. One or both of the SH3 domains of p67phox are known to mediate binding to a proline-rich region on p47phox (18Leto T. Adams A. Mendez I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10650-10654Google Scholar, 19Finan P. Shimizu Y. Gout I. Hsuan J. Truong O. Butcher C. Bennett P. Waterfield M.D. Kellie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13752-13755Google Scholar, 20Dorseuil O. Reibel L. Bokoch G. Camonis J. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 83-88Google Scholar). As shown, p67phox-(1-246) partially substituted for the full-length p67phox in supporting superoxide generation. Interestingly, in the absence of p47phox, truncated p67phox had a 3- to 4-fold lower EC50 than did full-length p67phox (see Table I). This may indicate that part of the function of the C-terminal half of the molecule is to mask or inhibit a binding domain in the N-terminal half. When this region is removed, the affinity of truncated p67phox for the NADPH oxidase is increased. Thus, in addition to acting directly to localize p67phox in the oxidase complex, we propose that another function of p47phox is to unmask a binding site(s) in the N terminus of p67phox by binding to regions in the C terminus of p67phox. Although both truncated and full-length p67phox both supported superoxide generation in the absence of p47phox, the Vmax for the truncated form was only about 25% of that of the full-length form. Thus, for unknown reasons, truncated p67phox is partially defective in its regulatory function. Surprisingly, when p47phox was included, there was a modest (4-5-fold) enhancement of the apparent binding of the truncated p67phox. This should be compared with the roughly 70-fold binding enhancement when intact p67phox was used. This is consistent with the known role of the SH3 domains in p67phox as a major determinant mediating binding to p47phox. However, the small enhancement of p67phox-(1-246) apparent binding by p47phox can probably best be explained by the presence of an additional binding region for p47phox within the N-terminal half of p67phox. This binding might also explain the modest increase in Vmax induced by p47phox. It is also possible that p47phox might induce its effects indirectly by altering the conformation of cytochrome b558. To investigate the influence of p47phox on Rac, the concentration dependence for Rac was determined in the presence and absence of p47phox. Results (Fig. 4) were similar to those seen with p67phox; p47phox caused a 35-fold decrease in the EC50 for Rac, but did not alter the Vmax significantly (Table I). This decrease in EC50 could be due to a direct interaction between p47phox and Rac, or it could be mediated indirectly through p47phox binding to and altering the Rac association with another component of the oxidase. No direct interaction between Rac and p47phox has been observed in vitro (20Dorseuil O. Reibel L. Bokoch G. Camonis J. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 83-88Google Scholar, 23Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-532Google Scholar), 2Y. Nisimoto, personal communication. but this remains a theoretical possibility. Alternatively, p47phox binding to cytochrome b558 or p67phox could induce a conformational change in one of these components, creating a higher affinity binding site for Rac. There is no direct evidence for binding of Rac to the flavocytochrome, although in vivo translocation data have been interpreted in terms of such a complex (4Heyworth P. Bohl B. Bokoch G. Curnutte J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Google Scholar). p67phox interacts with both p47phox and Rac (20Dorseuil O. Reibel L. Bokoch G. Camonis J. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 83-88Google Scholar, 23Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-532Google Scholar, 24Prigmore E. Ahmed S. Best A. Kozma R. Manser E. Segal A. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10717-10722Google Scholar). Therefore, the binding of p47phox to p67phox could induce a conformational change in the Rac binding site on p67phox, enhancing the binding of Rac. Based on current data, this seems to be the most likely mechanism, but this remains to be proven. Since we were able to activate superoxide generation independently of p47phox, we tested the hypothesis that p47phox is the target of activation by arachidonate, as has been proposed by us and others (14Uhlinger D.J. Tyagi S.R. Inge K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8624-8631Google Scholar, 36Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Google Scholar). Fig. 5 demonstrates that when high levels of p67phox and Rac are used, arachidonate is necessary for activation regardless of whether p47phox is present. Therefore, p47phox is either not the target of arachidonate activation or there is an additional component also influenced by arachidonate. Since the optimal concentration of arachidonate for activation is the same in the presence and absence of p47phox (data not shown) we favor the latter model in which p47phox is not the target of arachidonate. A possible target is cytochrome b558 since evidence also indicates that the proton channel activity associated with this transmembrane protein is dependent upon arachidonate (37Henderson L. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Google Scholar). p67phox might also be the target for arachidonate, consistent with a kinetic study using SDS, another anionic amphiphilic activator of the oxidase (38Fujimoto S. Smith R.M. Curnutte J.T. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21629-21632Google Scholar). An earlier study (25Cross A. Curnutte J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6543-6548Google Scholar) indicated a role for p47phox in facilitating electron transfers within the NADPH oxidase complex, specifically at the level of the reduction of heme by flavin. However, the data reported herein rule out such a function, since p47phox had no effect on the Vmax for superoxide generation when high concentrations of the other cytosolic components were used (Table I). We conclude that the role of p47phox is to provide high affinity binding sites for p67phox and (directly or indirectly) Rac, and that p47phox does not itself function in modulating the catalytic properties of the NADPH oxidase complex. In this sense, it can be considered an “adaptor protein” which enhances the binding of the other cytosolic proteins to the flavocytochrome. p47phox is phosphorylated at multiple sites in response to cell activation (39Babior B.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 361-367Google Scholar, 40Okamura N. Malawista S.E. Roberts R.L. Rosen H. Ochs H.D. Babior B.M. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1988; 72: 811-816Google Scholar, 41Teahan C. Totty N. Casimir C.M. Segal A.W. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 267: 485-489Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation is presumed to play a role in regulating the interaction of this adaptor protein with the flavocytochrome. Presumably, p67phox, Rac, or both proteins serve a direct regulatory role to enhance the electron flow within the NADPH oxidase complex. The data indicate that both p67phox and Rac bind weakly to the NADPH oxidase complex independently of p47phox. This implies that either Rac, p67phox, or both proteins have a binding site for cytochrome b558. With regard to Rac, evidence indicates that a site equivalent to the Ras effector site (residues 26-45) is important for binding within the NADPH oxidase complex (23Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-532Google Scholar, 42Freeman J.L.R. Kreck M.L. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13431-13435Google Scholar, 43Xu X. Barry D. Settleman J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19868-19872Google Scholar), and a study suggests that this is the region which binds to p67phox (23Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-532Google Scholar). We have recently described an additional effector site (residues 124-135) in Rac which is important for binding to the NADPH oxidase complex (45Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19794-19801Google Scholar). This region is a candidate binding site for interaction with the cytochrome. A third region, the C terminus, is isoprenylated and anchors Rac to the membrane. We find that the membrane interaction is essential for achieving high superoxide generating activity. 3M. Kreck, unpublished observations. Less is known about candidate cytochrome binding sites on p67phox. The present studies suggest the N-terminal half of the protein might contain such a binding site. Thus, Rac and/or p67phox bind directly to the flavocytochrome in such a way as to modulate the electron flow from NADPH to oxygen to generate superoxide. p47phox functions as an adaptor protein to bring the cytochrome and other cytosolic regulatory components into close contact. We would like to acknowledge Mary L. Kreck, Jong-Young Kwak, Shabnam Motalebi, David Uhlinger, and Xiangxi Xu for generously sharing reagents and for helpful discussion. We would also like to thank Alan Hall for providing the cDNA for truncated p67phox.

We identified a human cDNA that is a splice variant of the human GRB10 homolog GRB-IR, which we term GRB10/IR-SV1 (for GRB10/GRB-IR splice variant 1). The protein encoded by the GRB10/IR-SV1 cDNA contains an SH2 domain and a pleckstrin homology domain. Cloning of a full-length human cDNA revealed a predicted coding sequence that was similar to the mouse GRB10 protein, although GRB10/IR-SV1 contained an 80-amino acid deletion. The GRB10/IR-SV1 cDNA is a splice variant of the GRB-IR cDNA such that GRB10/IR-SV1 contains an intact pleckstrin homology domain and a distinct amino terminus. The interaction of GRB10/IR-SV1 with the insulin receptor and the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor is mediated by the SH2 domain, and we show that glutathione S-transferase-SH2 domain fusion proteins interact specifically in vitro with the insulin receptor derived from mammalian cells. The GRB10/IR-SV1 SH2 domain also interacted with an ~135-kDa phosphoprotein from unstimulated cell lysates, an interaction that decreased after insulin stimulation. We present evidence that the GRB10/IR-SV1 protein plays a functional role in insulin and IGF-I signaling by showing that microinjection of an SH2 domain fusion protein inhibited insulin- and IGF-I-stimulated mitogenesis in fibroblasts, yet had no effect on mitogenesis induced by epidermal growth factor. Our findings suggest that GRB10/IR-SV1 may serve to positively link the insulin and IGF-I receptors to an uncharacterized mitogenic signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2124636374,"We have previously demonstrated that growth inhibition of untransformed intestinal epithelial cells by transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ) and TGFβ2 was associated with a rapid activation of both Ras and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (Erk1) (Mulder, K. M., and Morris, S. L. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 5029-5031; Hartsough, M. T., and Mulder, K. M. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 7117-7124). In order to determine whether Ras was required for TGFβ regulation of both Erk1 and downstream components associated with TGFβ-mediated growth inhibition, the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line IEC 4-1 was transfected with a vector containing a dominant-negative mutant of Ras (RasN17) under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter. Using two different RasN17-transfected clones treated with ZnCl2, we demonstrate here that induction of Ras expression by at least 4-fold completely abrogated the TGFβ-mediated activation of Erk1. Moreover, the RasN17-mediated reversal of the TGFβ effect on Erk1 was dependent upon the level of expression of the dominant-negative protein. ZnCl2 treatment of control cells transfected with the empty vector did not alter Ras expression or the activation of Erk1 by TGFβ. In order to determine whether the activation of Ras by TGFβ was required for the growth inhibitory effect of TGFβ, we examined TGFβ2 effects on Cdk2-associated histone H1 kinase activity, cyclin A protein expression levels, and DNA synthesis in two intestinal epithelial cell clones transfected with RasN17. In cells expressing RasN17, we observed a 50% reversal of the inhibition of Cdk2 activity, a 78% reversal of the down-regulation of cyclin A protein expression, and a 21% reversal of the inhibition of DNA synthesis by TGFβ. Collectively, these results indicate that Ras activation is obligatory for TGFβ-mediated activation of Erk1, whereas it is partially required for the growth inhibitory effect of TGFβ. We have previously demonstrated that growth inhibition of untransformed intestinal epithelial cells by transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ) and TGFβ2 was associated with a rapid activation of both Ras and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (Erk1) (Mulder, K.

Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Google Scholar). TGFβ exerts these cellular effects through a heteromeric complex of the type I (RI) and type II (RII) TGFβ receptors, each containing serine/threonine kinase domains that interact in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (4Derynck R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 548-553Google Scholar, 5Chen R.-H. Moses H.L. Maruoka E.M. Derynck R. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12235-12241Google Scholar). However, little is currently known regarding TGFβ regulation of cytoplasmic components that are rapidly activated after receptor interaction with ligand. Two-hybrid screens have indicated that immunophilin FKBP-12 and farnesyltransferase-α specifically bind RI and that a novel protein, termed TGFβ-receptor interacting protein-1, interacts with RII (6Wang T.

We have reported direct evidence for the rapid activation of cytoplasmic signaling components by TGFβ in a mammalian cell system. That is, we have shown that both Ras and Erk1 are rapidly activated by TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 in TGFβ-sensitive epithelial cells but not in TGFβ-resistant cells (1Mulder K.M. Morris S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5029-5031Google Scholar, 2Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Google Scholar). These effects occurred in asynchronous cultures of epithelial cells under conditions where DNA synthesis was inhibited by 95-98% (2Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Google Scholar). The recent identification of the interaction between RI and farnesyltransferase-α mentioned above (7Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Engel M.E. Moses H.L.

Science. 1996; 271: 1120-1122Google Scholar) suggests a potential upstream mechanism for the activation of Ras in the TGFβ signaling pathway. The only other cytoplasmic signaling events that have been shown to be modulated by TGFβ in untransformed epithelial cells are an activation of protein phosphatase 1 (10Gruppuso P.A. Mikumo R. Brautigan D.L. Braun L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3444-3448Google Scholar), an involvement of protein kinase C in early TGFβ responses (11Ohtsuki M. Massaguá J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13600-13603Google Scholar). In contrast to the effects of TGFβ on cytoplasmic signaling components, a direct association between TGFβ modulation of nuclear cell cycle components and the growth inhibitory effects of TGFβ has been demonstrated. The G1 cell cycle events that have been shown to be mediated by TGFβ in untransformed epithelial cells include an inhibition of p34cdc2 synthesis, phosphorylation levels, and kinase activity (13Howe P.H.

Additionally, TGFβ has been reported to induce the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p27kip1, p21cip1, and p15ink4 and to enhance the association of these cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors with the relevant Cdk complexes (21Polyak K.

Finally, a direct association between the growth inhibitory effect of TGFβ and the ability of TGFβ to suppress both Cdk2 activity and cyclin A mRNA expression has been described in several epithelial cell types, including keratinocytes, lung epithelial cell lines, and mammary epithelial cells (21Polyak K. Kato J. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massaguá J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Google Scholar, 22Slingerland J.M. Hengst L. Pan C.-H. Alexander D. Stampfer M.R. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell.

In addition, down-regulation of either Cdk2 activity or cyclin A expression by TGFβ has been used as a general indicator of the TGFβ-mediated growth inhibitory effect (25Reynisdóttir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massaguá J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Google Scholar, 27Feng X.-H. Filvaroff E.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24237-24245Google Scholar). As discussed above, our previous results have indicated that activation of the cytoplasmic signaling components Ras and Erk1 occurred in parallel with the growth inhibitory effects of TGFβ. However, these cytoplasmic events have not yet been linked to TGFβ regulation of the nuclear cell cycle components that mediate the growth inhibitory effect of TGFβ. The dominant-negative Ras mutant RasN17 has been used to determine whether blockade of the normal function of endogenous Ras proteins alters growth factor regulation of cellular events; these events include activation of Erks and regulation of gene expression, cell growth, and differentiation (28Cai H. Szeberányi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5314-5323Google Scholar, 29Szeberányi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Google Scholar, 30deVries-Smits A.M.M.

In the current report, we have utilized this dominant-negative Ras protein to demonstrate that the activation of Ras by TGFβ is involved in the following events in untransformed epithelial cells: activation of Erk1, inhibition of Cdk2 activity, down-regulation of cyclin A protein expression, and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Our results indicate that activation of Ras occurs upstream and is required for the activation of Erk1 by TGFβ. Further, Ras activation is partially required, but is not sufficient, for the TGFβ-mediated effects on Cdk2 activity, cyclin A protein expression, and DNA synthesis. Erk1 antibody (SC-93), which has a higher affinity for Erk1 than Erk2, and cyclin A antibody (SC-751) were purchased from Santa Cruz Corp. (Santa Cruz, CA). Ras-10 antibody was purchased from Oncogene Science (Uniondale, NY). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the anti-CDK2 (06-148) antibody were purchased from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Insulin, transferrin, protein A-Sepharose, and myelin-basic protein (MBP) were purchased from Sigma. Histone H1 from calf thymus was purchased from Calbiochem. Nonimmune rabbit IgG was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). [γ-32P]ATP (3000Ci/mmol, BLU002H) and [3H]thymidine (20 Ci/mmol, NET027X) were obtained from DuPont NEN. Geneticin (G418) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 were generous gifts from P. R. Segarini (Celtrix Pharmaceuticals, Santa Clara, CA). The pM2NRasN17 plasmid containing the dominant-negative Ras (RasN17) under the control of a metallothionein promoter, as well as the empty vector (pM2N), have been described previously (31Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Google Scholar). The untransformed IEC 4-1 cell line was derived from IEC-18 cells as described previously (1Mulder K.M. Morris S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5029-5031Google Scholar, 33Mulder K.M. Segarini P.R. Morris S.L. Ziman J.M. Choi H.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 162-174Google Scholar). IEC 4-1 cells (1 × 106 cells) were electroporated in basal medium (SM) with 5 µg of either the pM2N or pM2NRasN17 plasmids at 400 or 450 V and 960 microfarads (34Wu S. Theodorescu D. Kerbel R.S.

Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 115-123Google Scholar). Two days following transfection, G418 (131 µg/ml; true concentration) was added to the medium for selection of positively transfected cells. G418-resistant colonies were pooled by trypsinization after 11-12 days of selection. The pool containing RasN17 was then cloned by limiting dilution and the N17C6, N17C5, and N17E3 clones were used for further studies. The IEC 4-1 cells and resulting transfected cells were maintained as described previously (1Mulder K.M. Morris S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5029-5031Google Scholar, 33Mulder K.M. Segarini P.R. Morris S.L. Ziman J.M. Choi H.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 162-174Google Scholar). N17C6, N17E3, and M2N cells were plated at a density of 6660 cells/cm2 in 25-cm2 flasks. One day later, cells were rinsed once with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and once with SM. Cells were then incubated in the absence (control) or presence of ZnCl2 (100 µM was found to be optimal for induction of Ras expression) for 36 h. Western blot analysis of Ras protein expression was then performed using the Ras-10 antibody, as described previously (36Buard A. Zipfel P.A. Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 539-546Google Scholar). N17C6, N17C5, N17E3, and M2N cells were plated at a density of 6660 cells/cm2 in 75-cm2 flasks. Cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of ZnCl2 for 36 h, as described above. After this time period, cells were treated with EIT (E = EGF (10 ng/ml) + I = insulin (20 µg/ml) + T = transferrin (4.0 µg/ml)) in serum-free medium for 3 min. Analysis of Ras bound to GTP and GDP nucleotides was performed using the Ras thin layer chromatography assay as described previously (36Buard A. Zipfel P.A. Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 539-546Google Scholar). N17C6, N17C5, and M2N cells were plated and incubated with ZnCl2 as for the Ras activation assay. Cells were then treated with TGFβ (10 ng/ml) or EIT (described above) for 10 and 5 min, respectively. Erk1 in vitro kinase activity was determined as described previously (2Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Google Scholar). N17C6, N17E3, and M2N cells were plated and treated with ZnCl2 as for the Ras activation assay. Cells were then treated with TGFβ2 for 6 h prior to determination of histone H1 kinase activity (16Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Whitehouse L.L. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 1009-1020Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4°C. Total protein levels were normalized for each sample, and lysates were adjusted to a final concentration of 1 mM dithiothreitol before immunoprecipitation with 4 µg of anti-Cdk2 antibody at 4°C for 2 h. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads, washed five times with NET-N buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 200 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and then twice with histone H1 kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol). Beads were then resuspended in 50 µl of H1 kinase buffer containing 10 µM ATP, 10 µg of histone H1, and 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP and were incubated for 30 min at 30°C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 50 µl of 2 × SDS loading buffer, and samples were boiled for 5 min before separation of proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%). Quantitation of radiolabeled histone H1 was determined by scanning of dried gels on a Betagen betascope 603 blot analyzer (Betagen Corp., Waltham, MA). N17C6, N17E3, and M2N cells were plated and incubated with ZnCl2 as for the Ras activation assay. Cells were then treated with TGFβ2 (10 ng/ml) for 12 h, followed by lysis in the assay buffer described previously (22Slingerland J.M. Hengst L. Pan C.-H. Alexander D. Stampfer M.R. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3683-3694Google Scholar). Total cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%); proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Cyclin A protein was detected by immunoblotting the polyvinylidene difluoride with a rabbit polyclonal cyclin A antibody (SC-751) for 1 h at 25°C, followed by a second incubation with rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 1 h at 25°C. Cyclin A protein was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. M2N, N17E3, and N17C6 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 in 12-well dishes. The next day, cells were washed three times with SM and were incubated in the absence or presence of ZnCl2 (100 µM) for 60 h. After this time period, TGFβ2 (10 ng/ml) was added to the appropriate wells, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was then determined as described previously (2Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Google Scholar). The results are presented as ± S.E. (n = 3). We have previously shown that the IEC 4-1 cell line is exquisitely sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of TGFβ (1Mulder K.M. Morris S.L. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1993; 154: 162-174Google Scholar) and that TGFβ treatment of these cells resulted in a rapid activation of the Ras and Erk1 signaling components (1Mulder K.M. Morris S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5029-5031Google Scholar, 2Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Google Scholar). Here we determined whether Ras activation was required for TGFβ regulation of specific downstream events, including the activation of Erk1 and the inhibition of Cdk2 activity, cyclin A protein expression, and DNA synthesis. Accordingly, a dominant-negative RasN17 mutant, under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter (31Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Google Scholar), was transfected into IEC 4-1 cells by electroporation. RasN17 transfectants were selected by treatment of transfected cultures with G418, and the resulting colonies were pooled and then cloned by limiting dilution. In addition, IEC 4-1 cells were transfected with the empty vector (pM2N) by electroporation, and positive transfectants were selected in the presence of G418. The resulting cell line was designated M2N and was used as a control. In order to determine if ZnCl2 treatment altered endogenous Ras protein expression, Western blot analysis of Ras proteins using a pan-Ras antibody was performed on cellular lysates obtained from M2N cells grown in the absence or presence of ZnCl2 (100 µM, 36 h). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, ZnCl2 treatment (100 µM, 36 h) of M2N cells did not alter endogenous Ras protein expression. Thus, Western blot analysis with a pan-Ras antibody can be used to measure ZnCl2-induced alterations of RasN17 protein expression in the RasN17-transfected cells. In order to determine the level of induction of RasN17 in the clones, we examined the ability of ZnCl2 treatment to induce Ras protein expression. As indicated in Fig. 1, Ras protein levels in ZnCl2-treated (100 µM, 36 h) N17C6 cells were assessed by Western blot analysis of cellular lysates using a pan-Ras antibody. Ras protein expression was increased to a level 4-fold above that in untreated N17C6 cells (Fig. 1, C and D). Moreover, as a positive control to demonstrate that induction of the dominant-negative protein resulted in an alteration of endogenous Ras function, we investigated the ability of RasN17 to block EGF + insulin + transferrin (EIT)-induced activation of Ras in N17C6 cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that expression of RasN17 resulted in a blockade of EGF- and insulin-induced activation Ras (37Medema R.H. deVries-Smits A.M.M. van der Zon G.C.M. Maassen J.A. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 155-162Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, EIT-induced activation of Ras in the control M2N cells was not altered by ZnCl2 treatment (Fig. 2, left side). In contrast, EIT treatment of N17C6 cells, in the absence of ZnCl2, resulted in a 3.2-fold elevation in the % GTP bound to Ras. After ZnCl2 induction of Ras by 3-4-fold in RasN17-transfected cells, a 40-50% reduction in the proportion of Ras bound to GTP after EIT addition was detected (Fig. 2, right side). Similar results were obtained in two other clones, N17C5 and N17E3. Thus, ZnCl2 treatment of RasN17-transfected cells, but not of cells transfected with vector only, resulted in both induction of RasN17 protein expression and a reduction in the ability of EIT to activate Ras. We have previously shown that the growth-stimulatory combination of factors EIT stimulated Erk1 activity within 5 min of treatment of cycling IEC 4-1 cells (2Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Google Scholar). Moreover, RasN17 expression has been reported to inhibit EGF- and insulin-induced activation of Erk1 (31Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Google Scholar, 38Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to further characterize the function of RasN17, in terms of its ability to alter EIT-induced activation of Erk1 in the N17C6 cells, we investigated whether expression of RasN17 in this clone would alter Erk1 phosphorylation of MBP following EIT treatment. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, EIT treatment of cycling N17C6 cells, in the absence of ZnCl2, resulted in a 14-fold activation of Erk1. In contrast, when RasN17 expression was induced by at least 4-fold, Erk1 was activated by EIT to levels that were only 5-fold above base-line values. Thus, RasN17 inhibited growth-stimulatory factor activation of Erk1 in the N17C6 clone by 60%, compared with that in cells not expressing the mutant protein. This level of inhibition of EIT-induced Erk1 activation is within the range of that previously reported for RasN17 blockade of Erk1 activation by a variety of growth factors (31Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Google Scholar, 38Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Google Scholar, 39Robbins D.J. Cheng M. Zhen E.

Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Google Scholar). Thus, the induction protocol employed here is suitable for examining the effect of RasN17 expression on TGFβ regulation of downstream components. We have previously demonstrated that treatment of untransformed epithelial cells with the growth inhibitor TGFβ resulted in a rapid activation of Erk1 (2Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Google Scholar). In addition, a more dramatic activation of other mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members has been observed in other epithelial-derived cell types 2R. S. Frey and K. M. Mulder, manuscript submitted for publication. (41Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13231-13237Google Scholar). Here we assessed the requirement for Ras activity in the activation of Erk1 by TGFβ. For these experiments, exponentially proliferating cultures of N17C6 cells were incubated in serum-free medium in the absence or presence of ZnCl2 (100 µM) for 36 h prior to TGFβ (10 ng/ml) addition. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either nonimmune rabbit IgG (nonspecific control, previously described in Ref. 2Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Google Scholar) or with an antibody specific for Erk1 (SC-93). Erk1 activity was then determined by in vitro phosphorylation of MBP, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylation of MBP was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by Betagen scanning. Additionally, equal loading of Erk1 was revealed by immunoblotting transferred proteins with the Erk1-specific SC-93 antibody (previously described in Ref. 2Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Google Scholar). As Fig. 3, A and C, depicts, TGFβ2 treatment of proliferating cultures of N17C6 cells, devoid of ZnCl2, resulted in a 2.1-fold increase in Erk1 activity within 10 min of growth factor addition. In contrast, Fig. 3, A and C, indicates that ZnCl2 induction of RasN17 expression by at least 4-fold resulted in complete abrogation (100% blockade) of the Erk1 activation by TGFβ2. Similarly, in a second clone (N17C5), induction of RasN17 expression by at least 5-fold (EIT-induced Ras activation was reduced by 40-50%) resulted in complete inhibition of TGFβ-mediated Erk1 activation (data not shown). When the results from all RasN17-transfected clones treated with either TGFβ1 or TGFβ2 were evaluated, the RasN17-mediated abrogation of Erk1 activation by TGFβ was statistically significant (p < 0.01, Student's t test). Furthermore, Erk1 activation by TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 was not altered by ZnCl2 treatment in the M2N control cells. Hence, these results indicate that in exponentially proliferating epithelial cells, Ras is an essential upstream signaling component for Erk1 activation by TGFβ. It was of interest to determine whether complete abrogation of Erk1 activation by TGFβ2 was dependent upon the level of RasN17 induction. Accordingly, Erk1 activity assays were performed in N17C6 cells under conditions that resulted in a reduced level of induction of RasN17 expression, compared with that utilized for Fig. 3. Moreover, since we have previously demonstrated that TGFβ1 also activated Erk1 (2Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Google Scholar), we examined whether Ras was similarly involved in the regulation of Erk1 by this TGFβ isoform. In these experiments, proliferating cultures of N17C6 cells, grown in the absence or presence of ZnCl2, were treated for 10 min with TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) or TGFβ2 (10 ng/ml). In the absence of ZnCl2, Erk1 enzymatic activity in the N17C6 cells was increased by 2.4- and 2.0-fold after addition of TGFβ1 and TGFβ2, respectively (Fig. 4). However, under conditions in which RasN17 expression was induced to a level only 2-fold above that in untreated cells, TGFβ1 and TGFβ2-mediated Erk1 activation was inhibited by only 34 and 20%, respectively (Fig. 4). These results indicate that inhibition of Erk1 activation by TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 is dependent upon the level of RasN17 expression. That is, induction of RasN17 expression must be greater than 2-fold above that in uninduced controls in order to efficiently block Erk1 activation by TGFβ. Similarly, previous reports have demonstrated that RasN17 blockade of the effects of growth-stimulatory factors and of the differentiation factor nerve growth factor was dependent upon the level of expression of the mutant protein (28Cai H. Szeberányi J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5314-5323Google Scholar, 29Szeberányi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Google Scholar, 39Robbins D.J. Cheng M. Zhen E.

In order to determine whether the Ras/MAPK pathway was required for TGFβ regulation of cell cycle components that mediate growth inhibition by TGFβ, we chose to examine Cdk2 activity and cyclin A protein expression. Both of these cell cycle components have been linked to the growth inhibitory effects of TGFβ (16Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Whitehou"

To test whether the 100-kDa subunit plays a role in proton transport, site-directed mutagenesis of the VPH1 gene, which is one of two genes that encodes this subunit in yeast, has been carried out in a strain lacking both endogenous genes. Ten charged and twelve polar residues located in the seven putative transmembrane helices in the COOH-terminal domain of the molecule were individually changed, and the effects on proton transport, ATPase activity, and assembly of the yeast V-ATPase were measured. Two mutations (R735L and Q634L) in transmembrane helix 6 and at the border of transmembrane helix 5, respectively, showed greatly reduced levels of the 100-kDa subunit in the vacuolar membrane, suggesting that these mutations affected stability of the 100-kDa subunit. Two mutations, D425N and K538A, in transmembrane helix 1 and at the border of transmembrane helix 3, respectively, showed reduced assembly of the V-ATPase, with the D425N mutation also reducing the activity of V-ATPase complexes that did assemble.

Our results strongly suggest that EBP and Δ8-Δ7 sterol isomerase are identical proteins in mammals. The biosynthesis pathway that is required to transform lanosterol into the major plasma membrane sterol, namely ergosterol and cholesterol, respectively, diverges in fungi and in mammals. Nevertheless this pathway constantly involves the isomerization of the B-ring double bond from the 8(9) to the 7(8) position in the sterol molecule. The enzyme responsible for this activity, namely Δ8-Δ7 sterol isomerase, is membrane-bound and located in the endoplasmic reticulum. In mammals, this enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 5α-cholesta-8,24-dien-3β-ol (zymosterol) and 5α-cholesta-8-en-3β-ol (zymostenol, Δ8-cholestenol) to their corresponding Δ7-isomers (1Yamaga N.

Paik Y.-K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 819-823Google Scholar). Recent studies have provided evidence in support of a regulatory role for this enzyme in controlling the overall rate of cholesterol biosynthesis (3Kang M.-K. Kim C.-K. Johng T.-N. Paik Y.-K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 819-823Google Scholar). The molecular mass of sterol isomerase purified from rat liver microsomes was estimated at 80 kDa (1Yamaga N. Gaylor J.L. J.

Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 819-823Google Scholar). In SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, this purified enzyme migrates as one polypeptide exhibiting an apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa, suggesting that rat liver sterol isomerase is composed of four identical subunits. In spite of these results, no sequence data of any high eukaryote sterol isomerase have been available so far. In contrast, the sterol isomerase-encoding ERG2 genes from the bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Arthington B.A. Hoskins J.A. Skatrud P.L. Bard M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 173-174Google Scholar, 5Ashman W.H. Barbuch R.J. Ulbright C.E. Jarret H.W. Bard M. Lipids. 1991; 26: 628-632Google Scholar), the rice blast fungus Magnaportae grisea (6Keon J.P.R. James C.S. Court S. Baden-Daintree C. Bailey A.M. Burden R.S. Bard M. Hargreaves J.A. Curr.

Mycol. 1994; 18: 87-92Google Scholar) have been isolated. Each of these three fungal genes encodes a polypeptide with a molecular mass ranging from 24 to 27 kDa depending on the species. Genetic analysis of S. cerevisiae erg2 mutants revealed several cases of intragenic complementation, suggesting that yeast sterol isomerase is also made of at least two identical subunits (8Ogorodnika T.E. Sinitskaya N.A. Shul'man A.I. Mikhailova N.P. V'yunov K.A. Genetika. 1988; 24: 1367-1370Google Scholar). All the three fungal ERG2 gene products share significantly similar sequences and present three common hydrophobic domains (6Keon J.P.R. James C.S. Court S. Baden-Daintree C. Bailey A.M. Burden R.S. Bard M. Hargreaves J.A. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 531-537Google Scholar). A particularly high degree of identity could be observed within the central hydrophobic region in all three proteins, and it was suggested that this domain could correspond to the catalytic site of the isomerase. We had tried to take advantage of this possible sterol isomerase signature to isolate a similar sequence from a mammalian source by polymerase chain reaction or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction but without any success so far. We therefore undertook a completely different selection approach based on the complementation of the erg2 gene defect in yeast. Successful functional complementation by expressing sterol biosynthesis enzyme-encoding cDNA in yeast mutants has already been achieved by others. For instance, rat squalene epoxidase and human lanosterol synthase complement the corresponding defects in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (9Sakakibara J. Watanabe R. Kanai Y. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17-20Google Scholar) and in S. cerevisiae (10Baker C.H. Matsuda S.P.T. Liu D.R. Corey E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 154-160Google Scholar), respectively. However, these genes correspond to enzymes of the sterol pathway section that is conserved from fungi to animals, and the corresponding enzymes share significant similarities in both phyla (9Sakakibara J. Watanabe R. Kanai Y. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17-20Google Scholar, 10Baker C.H. Matsuda S.P.T. Liu D.R. Corey E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 154-160Google Scholar). Our report is the first one on successfully applying such a strategy to isolate a mammalian sequence that encodes an enzyme of the post-lanosterol sterol biosynthesis pathway. We show in this report that this mammalian sequence corresponds to EBP, 1The abbreviations used are: SIsterol isomeraseEBPemopamil-binding proteinhEBPhuman EBPhSIhuman SImSImouse SIySIyeast SIwtwild typeGCgas chromatography. a high affinity binding protein for the anti-ischemic phenylalkylamine Ca2+ antagonist [3H]emopamil and the photoaffinity label [3H]azidopamil (11Moebius F.F.

EBP is a protein of unknown function that is sublocalized in the endoplasmic reticulum (11Moebius F.F. Burrows G.G. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 139-148Google Scholar). EBP is expressed in many tissues and specially abundant in liver (14Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Weber F. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7551-7557Google Scholar). A wide series of structurally diverse compounds with anti-ischemic effects in animal models of cerebral ischemia inhibit [3H]emopamil binding to EBP with high affinity. EBP might therefore represent a molecular target of anti-ischemic drug action (14Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Weber F. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. J. Biol.

EMY47 (MATα, ura3Δ, trp1-4, fen1::LEU2, erg2::TRP1) and EMY43 (MATα, ura3Δ, trp1-4, erg2::TRP1) were isogenic derivatives of S. cerevisiae wt FL100 (ATCC 28383). Yeast culture media were YPD medium and synthetic minimal (SD) medium containing 2% glucose and adequately supplemented to fulfill the strain's auxotrophic requirement (32Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194 (317329): 3-21Google Scholar). Anaerobic conditions were obtained using an anaerobic glove box (La Calhène, Válizy, France) under N2-H2-CO2 (85%-10%-5%) atmosphere. For anaerobic growth, media were supplemented with 0.1% Tween 80 and 50 mg/liter ergosterol. The effect of drugs on transformed cell proliferation was tested as follows. Transformants were selected in the absence of oxygen and grown for 24 h in ergosterol-free selective medium in the presence of oxygen. 5 µl of each cell suspension (approximately 105 cells) were plated onto medium containing drugs at different concentrations, as indicated, and plates were incubated at 30°C for 24 h. Haloperidol and trifluoperazine were obtained from Sigma Chimie (Paris, France). Fenpropimorph was a gift from F. Karst. Genetic engineering techniques and yeast DNA extraction were as described (32Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194 (317329): 3-21Google Scholar, 34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194 (317329): 3-21Google Scholar) containing 10 mg/liter cycloheximide; 60 cells were able to form colonies on that medium. Plasmid DNA was extracted from all these clones, amplified in Escherichia coli RR1 cells (Life Technologies, Inc.), and used to transform aerobically growing EMY47 cells. Plasmid DNA was extracted from 2 Ura+ cycloheximide-resistant transformants and analyzed by restriction mapping directly on double-stranded DNA. One insert was sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method directly on denatured double-stranded DNA. The sequence was later on verified on DNA obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification. The human cDNA library was constructed into the pTZ18R vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), using poly(A)+ mRNA derived cDNA from human cell line U937 (ATCC CRL 1593). Sequence analyses were performed using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group package (35Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Google Scholar). The percentage of similarity and pairwise homologies were assessed using the BestFit software. Data bases searches were conducted against GenBank™ and European Molecular Biology Laboratory releases. pEMR1023 is a multicopy plasmid, the structure and construction of which are fully described elsewhere (15Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.-H. Lanau C. Kaghad M. Dhers C. Picard C. Rahier A. Taton M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. Loison G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2719-2727Google Scholar). In summary, pEMR1023 is a S. cerevisiae-E. coli shuttle vector that contains URA3 as the selectable marker, a yeast 2-µm plasmid fragment encompassing the ARS and STB sequences, and an empty expression cassette containing the yeast PGK gene promoter and terminator. Plasmids pEMR1223, pEMR1235, and pEMR1336 are derived from pEMR1023 by the integration of a sterol isomerase-encoding sequence into the expression cassette, as indicated in Table I. Plasmids pEMR1349, pEMR1348, and pEMR1200 are centromeric plasmids that derive from pFL38 (ATCC77203) by the integration of an expression cassette into the polylinker, as indicated in Table I. This cassette is composed of the ERG2 promoter region (positions -295 to -1 of M74037 in GenBank™) followed by the ERG2 terminator region cloned as already described (15Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.-H. Lanau C. Kaghad M. Dhers C. Picard C. Rahier A. Taton M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. Loison G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2719-2727Google Scholar). Plasmid pEMR1292 is a pFL38-derived centromeric vector containing the mSI-expression cassette under the control of the yeast PGK gene promoter and terminator. Centromeric plasmids are normally maintained at about 1 copy per haploid genome in yeast; this copy number may increase slightly under selective conditions. The mSI sequence as cloned in pEMR1235, pEMR1292, and pEMR1349 corresponds to positions -3 to +703 with respect to the first base of the initiation triplet. The hSI open reading frame as cloned in pEMR1348 and pEMR1336 corresponds to positions +1 to +692 of sequence Z37986 in GenBank™. pEMR1223 contains a full-length mSI cDNA clone as described in the text. The mSI cDNA sequence has been submitted to the EBI data base (accession number X97755). All the cDNA fragments cloned in this study were sequenced to ensure the absence of mutations.TABLE IColony formation efficiency of EMY43 cells transformed by various plasmids in the presence and the absence of oxygenPlasmid (vector/promoter and terminator/SI coding sequence)Number of coloniesCells able to form colonies in the presence of oxygen+O2-O2%pEMR1023 (2-µm/PGK/none)Exp1014940Exp20>15000pEMR1223 (2-µm/PGK/original mSI cDNA)Exp1891187647Exp238999739pEMR1235 (2-µm/PGK/mSI)Exp1976120581Exp270776593pEMR1349 (CEN/ERG2/mSI)Exp1269180015Exp27018484pEMR1336 (2-µm/PGK/hEBP)Exp11155121295Exp21835201891pEMR1348 (CEN/ERG2/hEBP)Exp11855198294pEMR1200 (CEN/ERG2/ySI)Exp1968955101Exp277787489 Open table in a new tab Sterols were extracted from lyophilized cells in the presence of a constant amount of cholesterol (50 µg/50 mg dry weight) as already described (18Marcireau C. Guilloton M. Karst F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 989-993Google Scholar). Sterols were analyzed by gas chromatography with a Varian 3300 chromatograph, using a 30-m DB-1 column (inner diameter, 0.312 mm), a Ross injector, carrier gas helium 3 ml/min, column oven temperature programmed from 200 to 250 to 300°C at 10°C/min and 2°C/mn, respectively. Detection was obtained by a flame ionization detector with a detector oven temperature of 300°C. Sterols were compared with cholesterol by the area method (18Marcireau C. Guilloton M. Karst F.

Loison G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2719-2727Google Scholar). Sterols were extracted and purified from the reaction mixture (15Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.-H. Lanau C. Kaghad M. Dhers C. Picard C. Rahier A. Taton M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. Loison G. Mol. Cell.

In the presence of oxygen, all yeast erg2 gene disruptants produce Δ8-sterol molecules that characterize SI deficiency (5Ashman W.H. Barbuch R.J. Ulbright C.E. Jarret H.W. Bard M. Lipids. 1991; 26: 628-632Google Scholar, 15Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.-H. Lanau C. Kaghad M. Dhers C. Picard C. Rahier A. Taton M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. Loison G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2719-2727Google Scholar). However, depending on the genetic background (15Silve S. Leplatois P. Josse A. Dupuy P.-H. Lanau C. Kaghad M. Dhers C. Picard C. Rahier A. Taton M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. Loison G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2719-2727Google Scholar), some of these strains, like strain EMY47, are capable of proliferating under standard conditions of growth, whereas others, like strain EMY43, proliferate only anaerobically on ergosterol-supplemented medium. EMY43 cells being not easily transformable, we rather used EMY47 as the recipient strain to isolate the sterol isomerase-encoding cDNA. The accumulation of abnormal Δ8-sterol molecules and the absence of ergosterol in plasma membranes render EMY47 cells hypersensitive to various drugs like cycloheximide (5Ashman W.H. Barbuch R.J. Ulbright C.E. Jarret H.W. Bard M. Lipids. 1991; 26: 628-632Google Scholar). Active sterol isomerase production obtained by expressing a foreign cDNA in EMY47 cells was thus expected to confer a relative cycloheximide resistance by restoring ergosterol biosynthesis. A cDNA library prepared from mRNA extracted from murine myeloblast M1 cells was cloned under the control of the strong PGK promoter into a yeast multicopy expression vector. Library DNA was used to transform EMY47 cells to uracil prototrophy and relative cycloheximide resistance. One plasmid, denoted pEMR1223, was found to confer both traits. The cDNA insert (1106 base pairs) of pEMR1223 was subcloned and entirely sequenced. This cDNA contained a large open reading frame corresponding to a membrane polypeptide of 230 amino acids (Fig. 1). A polyadenylation signal was present 260 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon. The start codon was preceded by a 135-base pair-long sequence that notably contained an out-of-frame ATG at position -31, a feature expected to exert negative effects on gene expression in yeast (16Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 1-18Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses of RNAs extracted from M1 cells using the cDNA insert as a probe revealed the presence of an RNA of the expected size (approximately 1.1 kilobases, data not shown). The cDNA translation product ends with a C-terminal sequence, KSKHN, which fits the consensus retrieval signal (K(X)KXX, where X is any amino acid) known to anchor type I integral membrane protein into the endoplasmic reticulum (17Nilsson T. Warren G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 517-521Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a search for similarities in protein and DNA data bases (SwissProt and GenBank™) revealed that the murine gene product (mSI) was 78% identical to human EBP (hEBP) (Fig. 1B), a phenylalkylamine Ca2+ antagonist binding protein, but failed to reveal any striking similarities with other known sequences, including yeast sterol isomerase (ySI, 13% identity, 40% similarity) (Fig. 1A). The hydropathy profile of the murine protein corresponded to that of EBP (14Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Weber F. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7551-7557Google Scholar), exhibiting four putative transmembrane domains, but did not fit the three-hydrophobic domain model proposed for fungal SI (6Keon J.P.R. James C.S. Court S. Baden-Daintree C. Bailey A.M. Burden R.S. Bard M. Hargreaves J.A. Curr. Genet. 1994; 25: 531-537Google Scholar). EMY43 is an ERG2 gene disruptant that is unable to proliferate in ergosterol-free medium. In the presence of oxygen, EMY43 cells cannot utilize exogenously supplied ergosterol, so this strain proliferates only anaerobically on ergosterol-supplemented medium. pEMR1223, the original cDNA expressing vector, was used to transform EMY43 cells to Ura+ under strictly anaerobic conditions. The presence of the plasmid restored aerobic viability in EMY43 (Table I). GC analyses confirmed that ergosterol synthesis was indeed restored in EMY43 (pEMR1223) cells (Fig. 2). However, ergosterol was produced at a lower level in transformed cells than in wt, representing 28% of total sterols, whereas the Δ8-sterols that characterized sterol isomerase deficiency were still present at high levels. We constructed pEMR1235, a plasmid that differed from pEMR1223 only by the absence of the untranslated sequences at both sides of the cDNA open reading frame. EMY43 cells transformed to Ura+ by this optimized construct were able to proliferate aerobically and produced ergosterol and Δ8-sterols at wt levels (Fig. 2). The optimized expression cassette was cloned into a centromeric vector. EMY43 cells transformed with the resulting plasmid, denoted pEMR1292, produced ergosterol at a level 2-fold lower than with pEMR1235. Using cholest-8-en-3β-ol as the substrate, SI activity was detected in microsomes prepared from EMY43 (pEMR1235) cells, whereas this activity lacked in the negative control, as expected (Fig. 3).Fig. 3High pressure liquid chromatography assay for Δ8-Δ7-sterol isomerase. SI activity was assayed using cholesta-8-en-3β-ol and microsomes from various transformed strains, such as the substrate and the enzyme source, respectively. A, C, and E, microsome preparations were boiled prior to the assays (negative control); B, D, and F, standard incubations. A and B, microsomes from EMY47 (pEMR1023) (nude plasmid, negative control); C and D, microsomes from EMY43 (pEMR1235) (mSI); E and F, microsomes from EMY43 (pEMR1336) (hEBP). Sterol determination was as follows: peak 1, endogenous ergosterol; peak 2, exogenous cholest-8-en-3β-ol; peak 3, enzymatically produced cholest-7-en-3β-ol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the primary sequence of the mSI was 78% identical to hEBP, it was therefore reasonable to assume that these proteins were functionally homologous. hEBP cDNA was cloned under the control of the PGK promoter in a high copy number plasmid to yield pEMR1336. EMY43 cells transformed by this vector fully recovered the capability of forming colonies in the presence of oxygen (Table I). Moreover, these transformed cells produced ergosterol and Δ8-sterols at approximately the same respective levels as found in the yeast sterol isomerase-producing control (pEMR1200, see Fig. 2). To ensure that the sterol isomerase activity exhibited by hEBP was really significant and not an artifact linked to high level production, we cloned the hEBP coding sequence between the ERG2 promoter and terminator in a low copy centromeric plasmid to yield pEMR1348. EMY43 cells transformed by pEMR1348 produced ergosterol at a level corresponding to approximately 30% of total sterol (Fig. 2). This ergosterol amount was sufficient to restore an aerobic viability phenotype close to wt in EMY43 cells (Table I). In contrast, substituting the hEBP coding sequence by that of mSI (pEMR1349) in this centromeric vector resulted in a dramatic decrease in ergosterol production, which was not high enough to ensure correct aerobic viability (Table I). Approximately 10% of EMY43 (pEMR1349) cells could form colonies in the presence of oxygen, possibly as the result of a discrete amplification of the plasmid copy number leading to higher cDNA expression. In these transformed cells, ergosterol production was approximately 10-fold lower than that of the wt control. Western blot analyses of mSI and hEBP expressed in yeast indicated an approximately 5-fold overproduction of the human enzyme as compared with the murine one (not shown). Such a difference in production could explain why complementation was more readily achieved with hEBP than with mSI. Because EMY43 cells are strictly dependent on recombinant sterol isomerase activity to proliferate aerobically, these cells can be used to detect drugs that inhibit sterol isomerase (Fig. 4). As compared with the wt control EMY43 (pEMR1200), the mammalian SI-producing strains were found to be hypersensitive to the high affinity EBP ligand trifluoperazine but resistant to the low affinity EBP ligand haloperidol and to the fungal sterol biosynthesis inhibitor fenpropimorph. Sterol analyses of drug-treated cells indicated that trifluoperazine inhibited sterol biosynthesis at the SI step both in the yeast cells that were specifically producing hEBP or mSI (Fig. 5) and in animal cells, 2M.

Lupker, manuscript in preparation. but not in the yeast sterol isomerase producing cells (Fig. 5). The three sterol isomerases were assayed in the absence or in the presence of trifluoroperazine (Fig. 6). As expected, only the mammalian enzymes were inhibited by this compound. On the contrary, haloperidol was found to inhibit SI activity in ySI-producing cells, but not in hEBP- or mSI-producing cells, which did not exhibit any significant decrease in ergosterol production in the presence of the drug (Fig. 5). It is worth noting that haloperidol was nevertheless found to enhance the ergosta-8,14-dienol (ignosterol) peak in all the strains tested, which pointed to an inhibitory effect exerted on the yeast ERG24 gene product, namely C-14 sterol reductase (18Marcireau C. Guilloton M. Karst F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 989-993Google Scholar, 19Marcireau C. Guyonnet D. Karst F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 267-272Google Scholar). Because ERG24 is also an essential gene for aerobic proliferation in yeast (19Marcireau C. Guyonnet D. Karst F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 267-272Google Scholar), C-14 sterol reductase inhibition is likely responsible for the anti-proliferation effect observed with relatively high concentrations of haloperidol on mammalian SI-producing cells. Fenpropimorph is a powerful inhibitor of both sterol isomerase and C-14 sterol reductase in yeast (18Marcireau C. Guilloton M. Karst F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 989-993Google Scholar). Although this antifungal agent was found to provoke the accumulation of Δ8-sterols in all the strains tested, this effect was still much more efficient when exerted on the yeast enzyme (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Analysis of sterols produced by EMY43 transformants expressing either ySI (EMY43 (pEMR1200)) or hEBP (EMY43 (pEMR1336)). EMY43 (pEMR1200) and EMY43 (pEMR1336) transformants were grown in YPD for 24 h in the absence (-) or the presence of trifluoperazine, fenpropimorph, or haloperidol, as indicated. Sterols were extracted and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Trifluoperazine was found to inhibit mSI and hEBP but not ySI. In contrast, haloperidol inhibits ySI but not mSI nor hEBP. It is worth noting that haloperidol increases the peak 4, which indicates a C14-sterol reductase inhibition (see text). Finally, fenpropimorph inhibits all the three sterol isomerases with a marked preference for ySI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Inhibition of sterol isomerase activity by trifluoperazine. Residual isomerase activity was plotted as a percentage of the activity found in the absence of trifluoperazine against trifluoperazine concentration. Microsomes used for the assay were prepared from EMY43 cells transformed by SI-expressing plasmids as follows: pEMR1336 (hEBP, open circle), pEMR1235 (mSI, closed circle), pEMR1056 (ySI, closed square). SI activity is inhibited by trifluoperazine in EBP- or mSI- but not in ySI-producing cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have isolated a murine cDNA, the expression of which was found to restore the Δ8-Δ7 isomerization step required for ergosterol biosynthesis in a yeast mutant impaired in the sterol isomerase-encoding ERG2 gene. This cDNA was found to encode the murine homologue of hEBP. Several arguments strongly suggest that EBP and SI are identical proteins in mammals. First, exchanging the yeast ERG2 coding sequence cloned under the control of its own promoter in a centromeric plasmid with that of hEBP was sufficient to restore a phenotype close to wt in EMY43 cells with regard to both sterol production and formation of aerobically grown colonies. Thus, the sterol isomerase activity associated with EBP can be considered as really significant. Second, the high affinity EBP ligand trifluoperazine selectively inhibits the EBP-induced sterol isomerization reaction, both in vivo and in vitro, whereas fenpropimorph, a powerful yeast SI competitive inhibitor (18Marcireau C. Guilloton M. Karst F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 989-993Google Scholar, 20Baloch R.I. Mercer E.I. Phytochemistry. 1987; 26: 663-668Google Scholar) is not very efficient in inhibiting the EBP-induced isomerization reaction. It is worth noting that the sterol isomerization reaction is inhibited by trifluoperazine in animal cells as well. These two observations strongly suggest that the sterol isomerization reaction is performed by EBP itself and not by an hypothetical endogenous cryptic catalytic subunit that would need EBP to function in erg2 mutants. The subcellular localization of EBP is the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (11Moebius F.F. Burrows G.G. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 139-148Google Scholar, 14Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Weber F. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7551-7557Google Scholar), as expected for SI. Moreover, the tissue distribution of EBP mRNAs, being ubiquitous but specially abundant in liver, matches that expected for a cholesterol biosynthesis enzyme. Finally, rat liver SI migrates in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent molecular mass (21 kDa, see Ref. 3Kang M.-K. Kim C.-K. Johng T.-N. Paik Y.-K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 819-823Google Scholar) similar to that estimated by others for EBP from guinea pig liver and recombinant hEBP (22.5 kDa, see Ref. 14Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Weber F. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7551-7557Google Scholar) as well as for mSI expressed in yeast (22 kDa, data not shown). Neither EBP nor fungal SI share significant similarities with any other known protein of the data bases. The lack of similarity between EBP and ySI suggests the absence of phylogenetic relationship between both genes, which is not completely surprising because the segment of the sterol biosynthesis pathway that goes from lanosterol to cholesterol and ergosterol, respectively, is divergent in mammals and fungi. EBP was first described as a high affinity binding protein for the phenylalkylamine Ca2+ antagonist [3H]emopamil and the photoaffinity label [3H]azidopamil. A series of structurally diverse sigma ligands that exerted anti-ischemic effects in animal models of cerebral ischemia inhibited [3H]emopamil binding to EBP with high affinity, which suggested that EBP was a sigma site-carrying protein that represented a molecular target of anti-ischemic drug action (11Moebius F.F. Burrows G.G. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 139-148Google Scholar, 12Moebius F.F. Hanner M. Knaus H.-G. Weber F. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. J. Biol.

Weber F. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7551-7557Google Scholar). The so-called sigma receptors of unknown function bind a series of psychotropic drugs and are present in high density in the central nervous system and in peripheral organs (21Su T.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 633-642Google Scholar). The role of sigma ligands as neuroprotective agents has been extensively investigated for the past 2 years (22O'Neill M. Caldwell M. Earley B. Canney M. O'Hallaran A. Kelly J. Leonard B.E. Junien J.-L. Eur J. Pharmacology. 1995; 283: 217-225Google Scholar, 23Bergeron R. de Montigny C. Debonnel G. J.

These ligands appear to indirectly attenuate the receptor gated N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (commonly NMDA) calcium channels. This effect is thought to be exerted through sigma binding sites, although the so-called sigma receptors and the calcium channels are not co-localized subcellularly. It is worth noting that fenpropimorph itself was recently described as a sigma ligand exerting long term neuroprotective properties in glutamate neurotoxicity models (25Lesage A.S. De Loore K.L. Peeters L. Leysen J.E. Synapse. 1995; 20: 156-164Google Scholar). On the other hand, fenpropimorph was found to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis in 3T3 cells (28Corio-Costet M.-F. Gerst N. Benveniste P. Schuber F. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 829-834Google Scholar), its main target appearing to be lanosterol demethylase. This inhibitory effect on an upstream enzyme might expectedly have masked the one on SI that we have clearly observed using recombinant yeast strains devoid of endogenous SI (see Fig. 5). Haloperidol, a typical sigma ligand, has never been reported to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis so far. However, our results indicate that this compound is indeed a sterol biosynthesis inhibitor, at least in yeast. Therefore, one has to consider the possibility that inhibiting sterol biosynthesis at a post-lanosterol step might facilitate long term neuroprotection against glutamate toxicity. For instance, the accumulation of atypical sterols into the membrane lipid bilayer might indirectly attenuate glutamate-induced changes in calcium dynamics through altering membrane physicochemical properties. However, it is not yet clear if all the EBP ligands that display long term neuroprotective activities are indeed sterol biosynthesis inhibitors in mammals and, conversely, if all the SI inhibitors are neuroprotective drugs. The recently postulated role of EBP in neuroprotection (14Hanner M. Moebius F.F. Weber F. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7551-7557Google Scholar), the suggestion that SI, alias EBP, could be the first identified member of the enigmatic sigma receptor family, and the hypolipidemiant properties of SI inhibitors (29Popjak G.

The disruption did not affect the growth rate on glucose but reduced the growth rate on ethanol slightly. Although the growth rate of the acb1-disrupted cells was unaffected or only slightly affected, the acb1-disrupted strain was unable to compete with wild type cells when grown in mixed culture. The acyl-CoA level in the disrupted cells was increased from 1.5- to 2.5-fold during exponential growth. The increase in the acyl-CoA level was caused solely by an increase in de novo synthesized stearoyl-CoA. Experiments with purified yeast fatty acid synthetase show that it will synthesize long chain acyl-CoAs in the absence of acyl-CoA-binding protein. The addition of ACBP to the incubation medium resulted in a dramatic decrease in the chain length of the synthesized acyl-CoA esters. Despite the fact that the stearoyl-CoA concentration was increased 7-fold and the Δ9-desaturase mRNA level was increased 3-fold, the synthesis of oleic acid was unchanged in the acb1-disrupted strain.

Despite the fact that the stearoyl-CoA concentration was increased 7-fold and the Δ9-desaturase mRNA level was increased 3-fold, the synthesis of oleic acid was unchanged in the acb1-disrupted strain. The results strongly indicate that ACBP in yeast is involved in the transport of newly synthesized acyl-CoA esters from the fatty acid synthetase to acyl-CoA-consuming processes."

Several point mutations in TM V and VI and the intracellular loop 3 (i3) have been identified in the luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor gene, leading to constitutive activation of the receptor.

Taking advantage of this difference between the two receptors, we designed chimeric receptors with or without a point mutation in the i3 to identify the region in the LH receptor important for its constitutive activation. Introduction of the point mutation into chimeric receptors containing only TM V to VI from the LH receptor led to major increases in ligand-independent cAMP production. Furthermore, a chimeric receptor with only TM V and VI derived from the LH receptor can be rendered constitutively active by the mutation in the i3 from the FSH receptor. These results suggest that interactions between TM V and VI of the FSH receptor are essential for maintaining the receptor in the more constrained state, whereas interactions between these domains of the LH receptor are permissive for constitutively activating mutations in the i3.

https://openalex.org/W2042581920,"Two receptor pathways are thought to mediate the hepatic clearance of chylomicron remnants, (i) the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) pathway and (ii) non-LDLR pathway. The current study was undertaken to quantitatively assess the contribution of each receptor pathway to hepatic catabolism of chylomicron remnants, by using mice that are deficient in apolipoprotein E (apoE) (apoE(-/-)), the LDLR (LDLR(-/-)), and both (apoE(-/-);LDLR(-/-)). Vitamin A fat tolerance tests showed that the area under the curves of the plasma excursions of retinyl ester in the LDLR(-/-), apoE(-/-), and apoE(-/-);LDLR(-/-) mice were 4, 12, and 12 times larger than those in wild-type mice. The retinyl ester accumulated in the plasma of the LDLR(-/-) mice was distributed in larger subfractions of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, chylomicrons through very low density lipoprotein-C. These results indicate that the LDLR constitutes the major pathway for the clearance of retinyl ester. In support of this, agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that an oral fat load resulted in retention of chylomicrons in the LDLR(-/-) mice, which was not seen in wild-type mice. The observation that the apoE(-/-) mice showed larger retinyl ester excursion than LDLR(-/-) mice indicates that an apoE-dependent non-LDLR pathway is involved in the rest of the clearance of the retinyl ester.

INTRODUCTIONIn mammals including humans, dietary fat is absorbed by the small intestine, packaged in the chylomicrons, and transported through the lymphatic system to the systemic circulation. Lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzes the core triglycerides of chylomicrons, converting them to chylomicron remnants. The remnants are rapidly cleared by the liver. This step of rapid hepatic clearance has been thought to involve several different processes (for review see Refs. 1Havel R.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 312-316Google Scholar, 2Mahley R.W.

Lipidol. 1993; 4: 107-113Google Scholar). The initial process is sequestration of chylomicron remnants into the space of Disse, conceivably through the interaction of apoE on the lipoprotein particles with heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) 1The abbreviations used are: HSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycansapoapolipoproteinVLDLvery low density lipoproteinsLDLlow density lipoproteinsIDLintermediate density lipoproteinsHDLhigh density lipoproteinsRreceptorsLRPlow density lipoprotein receptor related proteinα2 Mα2-macroglobulinRAPreceptor-associated proteinFPLCfast performance liquid chromatographyAUCarea under the curve on the cell surface (4Ji Z.-S.

Subsequent steps might involve further lipolysis of the remnants by hepatic lipase (6Sultan F. Laglange D. Jansen H. Griglio S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 150-152Google Scholar, 7Shafi S. Brady S.E. Bensadoun A. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 709-720Google Scholar) and acquisition of apoE secreted from the liver (8Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Guo L.S.S. Krisans S. Havel R.J. J.

Invest. 1994; 93: 2215-2223Google Scholar). The final step appears to involve the cellular uptake of the lipoproteins, mainly by receptor-mediated endocytosis.ApoE is essential for the hepatic removal of chylomicron remnants, as evidently demonstrated by the fact that apoE-deficient humans (10Schaeffer E.J.

As to the role of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in the rapid plasma clearance of chylomicron remnants, conflicting results have been reported.Several evidences have suggested that the role of LDLR in the hepatic clearance of chylomicron remnants is marginal, if present. First, in LDLR-deficient humans (14Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Bases of Inherited Diseases. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1215Google Scholar) and rabbits (15Kita T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Watanabe Y. Hornick C.A. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3623-3627Google Scholar), accumulation of chylomicron remnants in the plasma is barely detectable. In support of this, the intravenously injected chylomicrons was cleared from the plasma of LDLR-deficient rabbits at a rate similar to wild-type (15Kita T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Watanabe Y. Hornick C.A. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3623-3627Google Scholar). Upon vitamin A fat tolerance tests, moreover, no significant delay of the excursion of the esterified form of vitamin A, which represents chylomicron remnants, was shown in LDLR-deficient humans (16Rubinsztein D.C. Cohen J.C. Berger G.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Coetzee G.A. Gevers W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1306-1312Google Scholar).On the other hand, chylomicron remnants have been demonstrated to bind to the LDLR through apoE that forms a major surface component of the lipoproteins in in vitro studies (15Kita T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Watanabe Y. Hornick C.A. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3623-3627Google Scholar, 17Wade D.P. Knight B.L. Soutar A.K. Eur. J.

J. 1988; 252: 553-561Google Scholar). When the LDLR was blocked by its monospecific antibody in mice (20Choi S.Y. Fong L.G. Kirven M.J. Cooper A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1173-1181Google Scholar) and rats (21Jackle S. Rinninger F. Greeve J. Greten H. Windler E. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 419-429Google Scholar), the clearance of chylomicron remnants was partially delayed. Moreover, the excursion of the esterified form of vitamin A in the plasma was significantly delayed in the LDLR-deficient rabbits (22Beaumont J.-L. Assadollahi F. Atherosclerosis. 1990; 85: 103-111Google Scholar, 23Bowler A. Redgrave T.G. Mamo J.C.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 381-386Google Scholar), suggesting that the LDLR plays a direct role in the chylomicron remnant metabolism. Demaker et al. (24Demacker P.N.M. van Giejst P.I. Stalenhoef A.F.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 641-646Google Scholar) pointed out that the delay might be caused by the defect in the clearance of LDL where retinyl ester was transferred from chylomicron.Recently, functions of either the LDLR (25Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Google Scholar) or apoE (12Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 458-471Google Scholar, 13Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Google Scholar) have been ablated in mice by means of homologous recombination. We compared the impact of each protein on the metabolism of chylomicron remnants in these mice. The plasma levels of apoB-100 were markedly elevated in the LDLR(-/-) mice, whereas they were not increased in the apoE(-/-) mice. The double mutant mice lacking both the LDLR and apoE showed elevation of the plasma level of apoB-100, indicating that the lipoproteins containing apoB-100 were cleared mainly by the LDLR, and this process is independent from apoE (26Ishibashi S. Herz J. Maeda N. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4431-4435Google Scholar). The LDLR(-/-) mice exhibited a modest increase in the plasma level of apoB-48, in contrast to the apoE(-/-) mice that showed profound elevation of the plasma level of apoB-48, supporting the hypothesis that some additional lipoprotein receptors recognize apoE on chylomicron remnants. But these additional receptors possess only limited capacity for endocytosis of chylomicron remnants, because feeding the LDLR(-/-) mice with a high fat diet caused a profound increase in the plasma level of apoB-48 to a degree comparable with that of the apoE(-/-) mice (26Ishibashi S. Herz J. Maeda N. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4431-4435Google Scholar).In the present study, we have employed vitamin A fat tolerance tests to analyze the chylomicron metabolism more quantitatively in the knockout mice. The results further supported the hypothesis that at least two receptor pathways are involved in chylomicron metabolism.RESULTSFig. 1 compares retinyl ester excursion curves in the mice of four different genotypes. Peaks of the excursions were reached at 4 h after injection and were identical in all four different genotypes. In wild-type mice, after reaching a peak, the value declined to negligible levels at 12 h after injection. The peak values and the area under the curve (AUC) in each mice are summarized in Table I.TABLE I.Peak values, area under curves, and clearances of plasma retinyl ester excursions in vitamin A fat tolerance testsAblated genesLDLR+/+-/-+/+-/-ApoE+/++/+-/--/-Available pathwaysLDLR/apoEynnnLDLR/apoEynynLDLR/apoEyynnLDLR/apoEyyyyPeak5.4 ± 1.621.9 ± 5.840.0 ± 11.738.4 ± 8.7AUCaAUC, area under curve.10.9 ± 3.144.7 ± 14.5131.5 ± 36.2126.6 ± 21.6% ClearancebThe clearance as indicated in percent of the value for the wild-type mice, which is calculated from inverse of AUC.

Open table in a new tab In the LDLR(-/-) mice, the peak values were 4 times larger than in wild-type mice. The AUC in the mice was also 4 times larger than in wild-type mice, indicating that the non-LDLR pathway is responsible for one-fourth of the overall clearance of retinyl ester. Thus, the significance of the LDLR pathway is 3 times larger than the non-LDLR pathway. Both the apoE(-/-) and the apoE(-/-);LDLR(-/-) double mutant mice showed more exaggerated and similar excursions. Since the two excursion curves were nearly superimposable, the contribution of the LDLR pathway to the apoE-independent clearance should be negligible. In both mutant mice, the peak values and the AUC were 7 and 12 times larger than those in wild-type mice, respectively, and were 2 and 3 times larger than those in the LDLR(-/-) mice, respectively. ApoE-independent clearance is 3 times smaller than the LDLR-independent clearance. Together with the fact that the LDLR-dependent clearance is totally dependent on apoE, the relative contribution of the apoE-dependent/non-LDLR-dependent clearance to the overall clearance is 1/4 × (null)/2;3 = (null)/1;6.The absolute levels of triglycerides in plasma were measured successively after fat load in wild-type and the LDLR(-/-) mice in a separate experiment. In wild-type mice, the plasma levels of triglycerides rose only slightly, whereas in the LDLR(-/-) mice, the levels were increased up to 50% higher than the base line, as shown in Table II.TABLE II.Plasma triglyceride levels after corn oil feedingTime (h)01246mg/dlWild-type56 ± 764 ± 2769 ± 2767 ± 1749 ± 3LDLR(-/-)86 ± 12ap < 0.05, compared with wild-type mice.85 ± 14128 ± 23ap < 0.05, compared with wild-type mice.130 ± 21bp < 0.01, compared with wild-type mice.133 ± 18ap < 0.05, compared with wild-type mice.a p < 0.05, compared with wild-type mice.b p < 0.01, compared with wild-type mice. Open table in a new tab To estimate the changes in size of the accumulated lipoproteins after vitamin A fat loading, we undertook subfractionation of lipoproteins by sequential ultracentrifugation. Table III compares the mean values for the excursions of total radioactivities in the plasma of the wild-type and LDLR(-/-) mice. Note that these values include both esterified and free retinol. Nevertheless, the significant delay of the clearance was observed in the LDLR(-/-) mice. The equal volumes of each plasma were mixed and subjected to sequential ultracentrifugation. In wild-type mice, all subclasses of the lipoproteins showed rapid turnover as shown in Fig. 2. Peak time of chylomicron, VLDL-A, and VLDL-D was 2 h, that of VLDL-B and VLDL-C was 4 h, and that of IDL and LDL was 6 h after the load. In the LDLR(-/-) mice, the peak time of large lipoproteins (d < 1.019 g/ml) was shifted to 8 h (Fig. 2). The AUC of the excursions in the LDLR(-/-) mice was significantly increased in larger lipoproteins (chylomicron, 9.3-; VLDL-A, 11.4-; VLDL-B, 15.1-; VLDL-C, 14.0-; VLDL-D, 6.5-; IDL, 2.3-; and LDL, 0.96-fold). Surprisingly, there was no difference in the excursions of LDL between wild-type and the LDLR(-/-) mice (Fig. 2, LDL panel), indicating that [3H]retinyl ester in the LDL fraction was not derived from resecreted hepatogenous VLDL as was observed in dogs (30Wilson D.E. Hejazi J. Elstad N. Chan I.-F. Greeson J.M. Iverius P.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 922: 247-258Google Scholar) and that transfer of [3H]retinyl ester in chylomicron to LDL is negligible in mice. Comparable amounts of fat and retinol should have been absorbed because the excursions of the radioactivities in the d >1.063 g/ml fraction were similar (Fig. 2, last panel).TABLE III.Plasma total retinol excursions in vitamin A fat load testTime(h)24681012dpmWild-type921 ± 2981596 ± 6351685 ± 4801432 ± 3251158 ± 2661026 ± 311LDLR(-/-)943 ± 4381901 ± 8833371 ± 14073464 ± 1431ap < 0.05, compared with wild-type mice.3353 ± 1340ap < 0.05, compared with wild-type mice.2480 ± 485ap < 0.05, compared with wild-type mice.a p < 0.05, compared with wild-type mice. Open table in a new tab Fig. 2[3H]Retinyl ester excursion in lipoprotein subfractions analyzed by sequential ultracentrifugation. After overnight fasting, female mice were anesthetized by pentobarbital, and 200 µl of corn oil supplemented with 0.2 MBq of [3H]retinol was administered by gastric intubation to wild-type (∘) and the LDLR(-/-) mice (•) (n = 5). 50 µl of plasma from each mouse are pooled, and lipoproteins were fractionated according to the method of Redgrave and Carlson (27Redgrave T.G. Carlson L.A. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 217-229Google Scholar). Radioactivities in 200 µl of the fractionated samples are indicated. One of the wild-type mice died after 1 h of anesthesia and was excluded from the results. Mean age and mean body weight of the mice at the time of the experiment were 21.5 weeks and 24.1 g, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm that the majority of the retinyl ester is distributed in large lipoproteins, we employed FPLC to see the distribution of [3H]retinol over the full range of lipoprotein particle size. 6 h after a bolus of corn oil supplemented with [3H]retinol was given to the LDLR(-/-) mice, the plasma was taken and subjected to FPLC. As shown in Fig. 3, 66% of the whole radioactivities were eluted in the fractions corresponding to chylomicron/VLDL, 16% in LDL, 3% in HDL, and 15% in lipoprotein-free.Fig. 3FPLC profile of [3H]retinol radioactivities in plasma from the LDLR(-/-) mice. 500 µl of corn oil supplemented with 3.7 MBq of [3H]retinol was administered by gastric intubation to two male LDLR(-/-) mice (8 months old). The plasma were pooled and aliquots were subjected to FPLC analysis.

Although the volume of each fraction was 0.5 ml in chylomicron through VLDL-D, 1 ml in IDL, 1.2 ml in LDL, and 3 ml in HDL, the same volume (10 µl) was applied to the gel. Thus, it should be taken into account that IDL, LDL, and HDL were 2, 2.5, and 6-fold underrepresented compared with larger lipoprotein fractions, chylomicron through VLDL-D. In agreement with the FPLC profile (25Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Google Scholar), HDL was the major lipoprotein fraction in the wild-type mice. In the LDLR(-/-) mice, non-HDL lipoproteins were distributed from VLDL-D to LDL, mainly in LDL and IDL. The LDL had β mobility and the VLDL-D had pre-β mobility. The electrophoretic mobility of the IDL was between β and pre-β. In contrast, the lipoproteins of the apoE(-/-) mice were distributed only in the larger subfractions, chylomicron through VLDL-C. The mobility of the chylomicron, VLDL-A, VLDL-B, and VLDL-C was β, β to pre-β, pre-β, and pre-β, respectively. The LDLR(-/-);apoE(-/-) mice contained appreciable amounts of lipids in the VLDL-D and IDL, in addition to the lipoproteins present in the apoE(-/-) mice. Interestingly, chylomicron that was ultracentrifugally isolated from either the apoE(-/-) or LDLR(-/-);apoE(-/-) mice had β mobility upon agarose gel electrophoresis.Fig. 4Agarose gel electrophoresis of the lipoprotein fractions from the mice fed a normal chow. Blood was collected from the wild-type, LDLR(-/-), apoE(-/-) and apoE(-/-);LDLR(-/-) mice fed a normal chow (n = 3). Equal volume of the plasma from three mice of each genotype was mixed, and 25 µl of it was used for the ultracentrifugation. 10 µl of each lipoprotein fraction of chylomicron (Chylo) through HDL was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. The gels stained with Fat Red 7B were shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5 compares the lipoprotein patterns of the wild-type, LDLR(-/-), and apoE(-/-) mice after the fat loads. No lipoprotein fractions from the wild-type mice showed any detectable staining in the origin of the agarose gels even after the fat load. However, chylomicron, VLDL-A, and VLDL-B from the LDLR(-/-) mice contained the lipoproteins that remained in the origin of the gels after electrophoresis. These results indicate that the clearance of chylomicron was delayed in the LDLR(-/-) mice, supporting the results of the experiments using retinyl ester (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Similarly, the apoE(-/-) mice showed staining in the origin of the gels too (chylomicron and VLDL-A).Fig. 5Agarose gel electrophoresis of the lipoprotein fractions after the fat load. 200 µl of corn oil was given to the stomach of the wild-type, LDLR(-/-), apoE(-/-) mice (n = 3). Mean age and mean body weight of the mice at the time of the experiment was 16 weeks and 22 g, respectively. Blood was collected 4 and 8 h after the fat load. Pooled plasma was subjected to sequential ultracentrifugation. Equal volume of the plasma from three mice of each genotype was mixed, and 250 µl of the pooled plasma was used for the ultracentrifugation. 10 µl of each lipoprotein fraction of chylomicron (Chylo) through VLDL-D was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis.

Fig. 6 compares the clearance of 125I-chylomicron remnants between wild-type and the LDLR(-/-) mice. The clearance of the 125I-chylomicron remnants in the LDLR(-/-) mice were slightly delayed as compared with wild-type mice. However, in both mice, major fractions of chylomicron remnants were cleared promptly from the circulation.Fig. 6Disappearance of 125I-labeled rat chylomicron remnants from the circulation of wild-type (∘) and the LDLR(-/-) (•) mice. 20 µg of 125I-labeled rat chylomicron remnants (specific activity, 520 cpm/ng) were injected into the jugular vein of wild-type (∘) and the LDLR(-/-) (•) mice (n = 7). The blood samples were taken at the indicated times. The apoB-associated radioactivities were measured and shown as % of the injected dose. The values are mean ± S.D.

In LDLR-deficient humans, delay of the plasma clearance of retinyl ester was not demonstrated at least in the initial 5 h after the vitamin A fat load (16Rubinsztein D.C. Cohen J.C. Berger G.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Coetzee G.A. Gevers W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1306-1312Google Scholar). In contrast, the experiments using Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits showed significant delay of the clearance of retinyl ester in the plasma; the peak levels were 5-15-fold higher than in New Zealand White rabbits (22Beaumont J.-L. Assadollahi F. Atherosclerosis. 1990; 85: 103-111Google Scholar, 23Bowler A. Redgrave T.G. Mamo J.C.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 381-386Google Scholar). Since substantial amounts of retinyl ester were shown to transfer from large chylomicron to smaller LDL fraction in rabbits, the apparent delay in the catabolism of retinyl ester was explained by the lipid transfer activities in these animals (24Demacker P.N.M. van Giejst P.I. Stalenhoef A.F.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 641-646Google Scholar). Our experiments using the LDLR(-/-) mice also demonstrated a similar delay of the clearance of retinyl ester in the plasma. As shown in Fig. 2, however, the results of lipoprotein subfractionation indicate that there was no accumulation of retinyl ester in the LDL fraction of the LDLR(-/-) mice. Thus, it is unlikely that either direct lipolytic conversion of chylomicron to LDL or transfer of estinyl ester from chylomicron to LDL caused the delay in the clearance of retinyl ester. Instead, the data should be interpreted simply as indicating that the LDLR is significantly involved in the chylomicron remnant metabolism. The LDLR activities in humans might be lower than those in the rodents (31Dietschy J.M. Spady D.K. Meddings J.B. Suckling K.E. Goot P.H.E. Hyperlipidaemia and Atherosclerosis. Academic Press, New York1988: 17Google Scholar), which is conceivably responsible for the species difference in the response to vitamin A load.Pathways for chylomicron remnant clearance can be classified into four groups according to the involvement of either apoE or the LDLR: apoE-dependent/LDLR, apoE-dependent/non-LDLR, apoE-independent/LDLR, and apoE-independent/non-LDLR pathways. Since the retinyl ester excursion curve in the apoE(-/-);LDLR(-/-) mice was almost identical to that in the apoE(-/-) mice (Fig. 1), it is safely concluded that all the LDLR-dependent pathways should be also entirely dependent on apoE. In other words, there is virtually no apoE-independent/LDLR pathway for chylomicron remnant clearance. This is consistent with the notion that chylomicron remnants bind to the LDLR exclusively through apoE. The AUC of the retinyl ester excursion in the apoE(-/-) mice was 3 times larger than in the LDLR(-/-) mice, indicating the existence of an apoE-dependent/non-LDLR pathway for the chylomicron remnant removal, which is also known as “chylomicron remnant receptor(s).”Our estimation on the contribution of the LDLR to the overall clearance of chylomicron remnants is 75%, based on vitamin A tolerance tests, and is largely consistent with the results of a study in which the amounts of the injected chylomicron remnants in the isolated endosomes were compared between the LDLR(-/-) and wild-type mice (32Herz J. Qiu S.-Q. Oesterle A. DeSilva H.V. Shafi S. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4611-4615Google Scholar). The accumulation of endosomal chylomicron remnants in the liver was almost abolished in the LDLR(-/-) mice, whereas it was readily demonstrated in wild-type mice. The slow uptake of chylomicron remnants, which was observed even in the LDLR(-/-) mice, was further inhibited by the intravenous injection of 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP). It appears that this non-LDLR pathway that is sensitive to RAP corresponds to the apoE-dependent/non-LDLR in our experiments.Similarly, the results of agarose gel electrophoresis also supports the notion that the clearance of chylomicron is blocked in the LDLR(-/-) mice as shown in Fig. 5.Although the proportion of the apoE-dependent/non-LDLR pathway in the overall metabolism of chylomicron remnants is only (null)/1;6, chylomicron remnants do not accumulate in the plasma of the LDLR-deficient humans and animals fed a normal chow (14Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Bases of Inherited Diseases. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1215Google Scholar, 15Kita T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Google Scholar). They begin to accumulate only when the function of the apoE-dependent/non-LDLR pathway is blocked either by RAP (33Willnow T.E. Sheng Z. Ishibashi S. Herz J. Science. 1994; 264: 1471-1474Google Scholar) or by depletion of apoE (10Schaeffer E.J. Gregg R.E. Ghiselli G. Forte T.M. Ordovas J.M. Zech R.A. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1206-1219Google Scholar, 11Mabuchi H. Itoh H. Takeda M. Kajinami K. Wakasugi T. Koizumi J. Takeda R. Asagami C. Metabolism. 1989; 38: 115-119Google Scholar, 12Zhang S.H.

Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Google Scholar), indicating that the apoE-dependent/non-LDLR pathway serves as a backup system for chylomicron clearance and is efficient enough as long as it is not overloaded by dietary fats.However, the difference in the clearance of 125I-rat chylomicron remnants between wild-type and the LDLR(-/-) mice fed a normal chow were marginal, 5-10% (Fig. 6). Similar differences were reported by Choi et al. (20Choi S.Y. Fong L.G. Kirven M.J. Cooper A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1173-1181Google Scholar) and Jackle et al. (21Jackle S. Rinninger F. Greeve J. Greten H. Windler E. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 419-429Google Scholar), who used anti-LDLR antibody to distinguish the LDLR pathway from the non-LDLR pathway. Likewise, large VLDL was reported to rapidly disappear from the plasma of LDLR-deficient rabbits (34Yamada N. Shames D.M. Takahashi K. Havel R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 2106-2113Google Scholar). Apparently, these results are not in agreement with our data of the vitamin A fat tolerance tests. This disagreement might arise from inappropriate interpretation of the tracer turnover studies. Tracer studies are valid, only if the tracee is in a steady state where synthesis and catabolism are in equilibrium (35Matthews C.M.E. Phys. Med. Biol. 1957; 2: 36-53Google Scholar). Chylomicron remnants appear in the plasma only after fat ingestion, and never reach a steady state. Moreover, it is impractical to use proper amounts of the tracer, because its tracee, chylomicron remnants, is virtually absent in the plasma of fasted mice (1Havel R.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 312-316Google Scholar, 34Yamada N. Shames D.M. Takahashi K. Havel R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 2106-2113Google Scholar). We speculate that the injected chylomicron remnants might be removed from the circulation by a mechanism that is distinct either from the LDLR or from the non-LDLR pathway as defined in the experiment of Fig. 1. This mechanism might be adsorption to the third compartment that is not equilibrated with chylomicron remnants, e.g. sequestratation to surface of the space of Disse (4Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Google Scholar, 5Ji Z.W. Mahley R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1995; 14: 2025-2032Google Scholar, 9Shimano H. Namba Y. Ohsuga J. Kawamura M. Yamamoto K.

A. 1995; 92: 4611-4615Google Scholar). HSPG has emerged as the most likely candidate for the putative sequestrative sites responsible for the initial rapid clearance of the injected chylomicron remnants (4Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Google Scholar, 5Ji Z.W. Mahley R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1995; 14: 2025-2032Google Scholar, 36Hussain M.M. Innerarity T.L. Brecht W.J. Mahley R.W. J.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 583-592Google Scholar).Although the identity of the apoE-dependent/non-LDLR pathway for chylomicron remnant clearance is still largely unknown, circumstantial evidences suggest that LRP/α2MR and/or HSPG are a chylomicron remnant receptor(s). Because RAP inhibits not only the LRP/α2MR function in vitro (38Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Google Scholar) but also the apoE-dependent/non-LDLR pathway for chylomicron remnant clearance in vivo (36Hussain M.M. Innerarity T.L. Brecht W.J. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8578-8587Google Scholar, 39Hussain M.M. Maxfield F.R. Mas-Oliva J. Tabas I. Ji Z.-S. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13936-13940Google Scholar, 40Choi S.Y. Cooper A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15804-15811Google Scholar), it is reasonable to consider the LRP/α2MR as the apoE-dependent/non-LDLR pathway. However, it still remains possible that other RAP-sensitive mechanisms mediate the apoE-dependent/non-LDLR process for the chylomicron remnant uptake, because it has been shown that RAP binds to multiple members of the LDLR family, including not only LRP/α2MR but also the LDLR (41Battey F.D. Gafvels M.E. FitzGerald D.J. Argraves W.S. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Google Scholar, 42Mokuno H. Brady S. Kotite L. Herz J. Havel R.J. J.

Biemesderier D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 89: 6698-6702Google Scholar). It was also shown that RAP binds to HSPG (46Ji Z.-S. Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. Hussain M.M. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10160-10167Google Scholar). The mice lacking both RAP and the LDLR had reduced expression of the LRP/α2MR in the liver and accumulated chylomicron remnants in the plasma, supporting the notion that the LRP/α2MR is directly involved in the metabolism of chylomicron remnants (47Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Google Scholar).In conclusion, the current data confirm that the LDLR pathway plays a significant role in the chylomicron remnant metabolism. INTRODUCTIONIn mammals including humans, dietary fat is absorbed by the small intestine, packaged in the chylomicrons, and transported through the lymphatic system to the systemic circulation. Lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzes the core triglycerides of chylomicrons, converting them to chylomicron remnants. The remnants are rapidly cleared by the liver. This step of rapid hepatic clearance has been thought to involve several different processes (for review see Refs. 1Havel R.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 312-316Google Scholar, 2Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Bases of Inherited Diseases. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1994: 1953Google Scholar, 3Herz J. Curr. Opon. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 107-113Google Scholar). The initial process is sequestration of chylomicron remnants into the space of Disse, conceivably through the interaction of apoE on the lipoprotein particles with heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) 1The abbreviations used are: HSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycansapoapolipoproteinVLDLvery low density lipoproteinsLDLlow density lipoproteinsIDLintermediate density lipoproteinsHDLhigh density lipoproteinsRreceptorsLRPlow density lipoprotein receptor related proteinα2 Mα2-macroglobulinRAPreceptor-associated proteinFPLCfast performance liquid chromatographyAUCarea under the curve on the cell surface (4Ji Z.-S.

Subsequent steps might involve further lipolysis of the remnants by hepatic lipase (6Sultan F. Laglange D. Jansen H. Griglio S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 150-152Google Scholar, 7Shafi S. Brady S.E. Bensadoun A. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 709-720Google Scholar) and acquisition of apoE secreted from the liver (8Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Guo L.S.S. Krisans S. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1589-1603Google Scholar, 9Shimano H. Namba Y. Ohsuga J. Kawamura M. Yamamoto K. Shimada M. Gotoda T. Harada K. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2215-2223Google Scholar). The final step appears to involve the cellular uptake of the lipoproteins, mainly by receptor-mediated endocytosis.ApoE is essential for the hepatic removal of chylomicron remnants, as evidently demonstrated by the fact that apoE-deficient humans (10Schaeffer E.J.

As to the role of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in the rapid plasma clearance of chylomicron remnants, conflicting results have been reported.Several evidences have suggested that the role of LDLR in the hepatic clearance of chylomicron remnants is marginal, if present. First, in LDLR-deficient humans (14Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Bases of Inherited Diseases. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1215Google Scholar) and rabbits (15Kita T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Watanabe Y. Hornick C.A. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3623-3627Google Scholar), accumulation of chylomicron remnants in the plasma is barely detectable. In support of this, the intravenously injected chylomicrons was cleared from the plasma of LDLR-deficient rabbits at a rate similar to wild-type (15Kita T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Watanabe Y. Hornick C.A. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3623-3627Google Scholar). Upon vitamin A fat tolerance tests, moreover, no significant delay of the excursion of the esterified form of vitamin A, which represents chylomicron remnants, was shown in LDLR-deficient humans (16Rubinsztein D.C. Cohen J.C. Berger G.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Coetzee G.A. Gevers W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1306-1312Google Scholar).On the other hand, chylomicron remnants have been demonstrated to bind to the LDLR through apoE that forms a major surface component of the lipoproteins in in vitro studies (15Kita T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Watanabe Y. Hornick C.A. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3623-3627Google Scholar, 17Wade D.P. Knight B.L. Soutar A.K. Eur. J.

J. 1988; 252: 553-561Google Scholar). When the LDLR was blocked by its monospecific antibody in mice (20Choi S.Y. Fong L.G. Kirven M.J. Cooper A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1173-1181Google Scholar) and rats (21Jackle S. Rinninger F. Greeve J. Greten H. Windler E. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 419-429Google Scholar), the clearance of chylomicron remnants was partially delayed. Moreover, the excursion of the esterified form of vitamin A in the plasma was significantly delayed in the LDLR-deficient rabbits (22Beaumont J.-L. Assadollahi F. Atherosclerosis. 1990; 85: 103-111Google Scholar, 23Bowler A. Redgrave T.G. Mamo J.C.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 381-386Google Scholar), suggesting that the LDLR plays a direct role in the chylomicron remnant metabolism. Demaker et al. (24Demacker P.N.M. van Giejst P.I. Stalenhoef A.F.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 641-646Google Scholar) pointed out that the delay might be caused by the defect in the clearance of LDL where retinyl ester was transferred from chylomicron.Recently, functions of either the LDLR (25Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Google Scholar) or apoE (12Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 458-471Google Scholar, 13Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Google Scholar) have been ablated in mice by means of homologous recombination. We compared the impact of each protein on the metabolism of chylomicron remnants in these mice. The plasma levels of apoB-100 were markedly elevated in the LDLR(-/-) mice, whereas they were not increased in the apoE(-/-) mice. The double mutant mice lacking both the LDLR and apoE showed elevation of the plasma level of apoB-100, indicating that the lipoproteins containing apoB-100 were cleared mainly by the LDLR, and this process is independent from apoE (26Ishibashi S. Herz J. Maeda N. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4431-4435Google Scholar). The LDLR(-/-) mice exhibited a modest increase in the plasma level of apoB-48, in contrast to the apoE(-/-) mice that showed profound elevation of the plasma level of apoB-48, supporting the hypothesis that some additional lipoprotein receptors recognize apoE on chylomicron remnants. But these additional receptors possess only limited capacity for endocytosis of chylomicron remnants, because feeding the LDLR(-/-) mice with a high fat diet caused a profound increase in the plasma level of apoB-48 to a degree comparable with that of the apoE(-/-) mice (26Ishibashi S. Herz J. Maeda N. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4431-4435Google Scholar).In the present study, we have employed vitamin A fat tolerance tests to analyze the chylomicron metabolism more quantitatively in the knockout mice. The results further supported the hypothesis that at least two receptor pathways are involved in chylomicron metabolism."

We have used these cells to characterize the role of the Ren-1c proximal promoter (+6 to -117) in the regulation of renin gene transcription. It was found that 4.1 kilobases (kb) of Ren-1c 5′-flanking sequence, in combination with the proximal promoter, are required for strong activation (~2 orders of magnitude over the basal level of the promoter alone) of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter in transfection assays. Within the 4.1-kb fragment, a 241-base pair region was identified that retains full activity in an orientation-independent manner in combination with the promoter. The resulting transcripts initiate at the normal renin start site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified a sequence at approximately position -60 in the promoter region that binds nuclear proteins specific for renin-expressing As4.1 cells. Mutations in this sequence, which disrupt binding of nuclear protein(s), completely abolish activation of transcription by the 4.1-kb fragment. Activation of transcription by the 241-base pair enhancer was still observed, although it was diminished in magnitude (60-fold over the mutated promoter alone). We present a model derived from the current data that suggests that regulation of renin expression is achieved through cooperation of transcription factors binding at the proximal promoter element and a distal enhancer element to abrogate or override the effects of an intervening negative regulatory region.

Store depletion led to activation of the calcium-specific leak channel, as assayed using single-channel patch clamp analysis and rates of manganese influx and quenching of fura-2 fluorescence. Two novel dihydropyridine compounds inhibited this single-channel leak channel activity, the resting and depletion-induced manganese influx, and refilling of the CPA-depleted intracellular calcium store. These compounds represent the first antagonists for a calcium leak channel and for a channel that mediates a capacitative current. The development of the skeletal muscle capacitative current was inhibited by genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but was not affected by okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, or econazole.

Physiol. 1992; 263: C1310-C1313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There exist two major questions regarding the capacitative current: 1) What signal(s) communicates the filling state of the calcium stores to the plasma membrane, and 2) what channel(s) open in response to this signal? No clear candidate for the signal from depleted stores has been identified, although numerous second messengers have been suggested (for review see Refs. 1Putney Jr., J. Bird G.S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar and 2Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar)). Similarly, the calcium-specific channel(s) that mediate this pathway are generally unknown and are only observed as whole cell currents (3Hoth M. Penner R.

However, small conductance plasma membrane channels underlying a capacitative current have been identified using single channel patch methods in an epithelial cell line (20Luckhoff A. Clapham D.E. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 177-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and in endothelial cells (21Vaca L. Kunze D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C920-C925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the gene product underlying the trp Drosophila photoreceptor mutant has been characterized as mediating a calcium-selective leak current that is activated by calcium store depletion (22Vaca L. Sinkins W.G. Hu Y. Kunze D.L. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1501-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hu Y. Schilling W.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but single-channel properties remain to be determined. Here, we provide evidence that cultured skeletal muscle cells possessed a capacitative current that was mediated by the calcium-specific leak channel, first described in skeletal muscle in studies of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (24Fong P.

It possesses similar genetic and biochemical defects as Duchenne humans (29Bulfield G. Siller W.G. Wight P.A. Moore K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Manganese quenching assays and calcium measurements were performed as described (27Denetclaw W.F. Hopf F.W. Cox G.A. Chamberlain J.S. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Hopf F.W. Turner P.R. Denetclaw Jr., W.F. Reddy P. Steinhardt R.A. Am. J.

Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Changes in intracellular fura-2 fluorescence intensity at the isosbestic wavelength (357 ± 5 nm) were assayed in the presence of extracellular MnCl2 as a measure of plasma membrane permeability to Mn2+, an indirect indicator of Ca2+ permeability (36Mertz L.M. Baum B.J. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15010-15014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mason M.J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

MnCl2 was used at 100 µM, unless otherwise indicated. In control experiments without Mn2+, the intensity at 357 nm changed no more than 5% during high potassium or CPA-induced calcium transients. The rate of loss of fluorescence intensity was divided by the initial fluorescence intensity in the cell to correct for differences in cell size and expressed as percentage per minute (%/min). Fluorescence experiments were carried out at 32°C, rather than 37°C, to reduce compartmentalization of fura-2 (28Hopf F.W. Turner P.R. Denetclaw Jr., W.F. Reddy P. Steinhardt R.A. Am. J. Phys. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar, 40Negulescu P.A. Machen T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 38-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Patch methods were as described previously (27Denetclaw W.F. Hopf F.W. Cox G.A. Chamberlain J.S. Steinhardt R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Hopf F.W. Turner P.R. Denetclaw Jr., W.F. Reddy P. Steinhardt R.A. Am. J. Phys. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar), using 96 mM BaCl2 or MnCl2 as charge carrier in the pipette. The leak channel is similarly permeable to Mn2+ and Ba2+ (28Hopf F.W. Turner P.R. Denetclaw Jr., W.F. Reddy P. Steinhardt R.A. Am. J. Phys. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Data were recorded at a 3- or 10-kHz sampling rate with 2-kHz filtering and filtered at 1 kHz upon playback. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were carried out in a low calcium rodent Ringer's solution (RRS, 138 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.06 mM MgCl2, 0.18 mM CaCl2, 5.6 mM glucose, 12.4 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) to suppress spontaneous contractions. Nominally calcium-free Ringer's solution was RRS with no CaCl2 added. AN406 (dimethyl 2,6-dimethyl-4-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate) and AN1043 (dimethyl 2,6-dimethyl-4-(4-bromophenyl)-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate) were generously provided by Athena Neurosciences (South San Francisco, CA), and were prepared in 10 mM stocks in Me2SO and stored at -20°C. Cell-free solutions used to test drug autofluorescence contained 130 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.02, 0.1% fura-2 buffer (1.1 M D-gluconic acid, K+ salt; 10 mM HEPES; 10 mM CaCl2, pH 7), 10 µM fura-2 free acid, either 0.8 mM EGTA or 0.4 mM calcium, and 0.1% Me2SO or 0.1% (10 µM) AN compound dissolved in Me2SO. AN compounds are stable and retain potency for ~4 h at room temperature. Okadaic acid, econazole, and genistein were from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). Cyclopiazonic acid and all other chemicals were from Sigma. We chose to use CPA instead of thapsigargin, another ATPase inhibitor (37Mason M.J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20856-20862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because effects of CPA are reversible with washout, while those of thapsigargin are not. All significance values were calculated using a two-tailed Student's t test, unless otherwise indicated. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. To ensure that changes in fluorescence intensity after the addition of AN1043 were due to action upon the leak channel, we must ensure that drug interactions with fura-2 or autofluorescence did not significantly contribute to the measured fluorescence intensity changes. AN1043 (10 µM) and AN406 (10 µM) did not significantly affect fura-2 fluorescence intensity in cell-free solutions compared with Me2SO controls (data not shown). Also, 10 µM AN1043 did not affect measured [Ca2+]i during calibration of myotubes with ionomycin (1-2 µM) in extracellular RRS containing 250 nM calcium (AN1043 present: 245 ± 11 nM calcium, n = 5; AN1043 absent: 250 ± 12 nM calcium, n = 5). Finally, AN1043 did not affect fura-2 detection of ionomycin-induced manganese influx or release of intracellular calcium (data not shown). These data suggest that AN1043 did not affect fura-2 measurement of [Ca2+]i. A small autofluorescence artifact, detected as slowly increasing fluorescence intensity, was observed after the addition of 10 µM AN1043. This was probably a consequence of drug binding to myotubes, because the rate of fluorescence increase was lower in dishes that had been scraped to remove cells (42 ± 11 intensity units/min, n = 3; intensity values here and below are given for 357 nm and are an arbitrary scale), and the rate of increase was not different (p > 0.2) between myotubes loaded with fura-2 (219 ± 28 intensity units/min, n = 24 of 34 cells) and unloaded myotubes (154 ± 46 intensity units/min, n = 12 of 12 cells). Similar autofluorescence effects were observed with AN406 (data not shown). As described below, the rate of manganese quenching of fura-2 fluorescence decreased significantly after the addition of AN1043 or AN406 (see Fig. 4 and Table II). Decreased quenching rates could have resulted from AN compounds blocking leak channel activity and preventing manganese entry or could have been due to drug autofluorescence (a rise in fluorescence intensity) superimposed on the manganese-induced fluorescence quenching (a drop in fluorescence intensity). However, the latter possibility is unlikely for the following reasons. 1) Fura-2 fluorescence intensity in cells for experiments in which MnCl2 was added was 9100 ± 1450 intensity units (n = 28). Thus, autofluorescence should have contributed a mean 2.4%/min (219 units/9100 units) increase in fluorescence intensity. This was significantly less than the inhibition in fluorescence quenching observed after the addition of 10 µM AN1043 to CPA- and manganese-treated myotubes (quenching rate before AN1043, 8.9 ± 1.2%/min; after AN1043, 0.83 ± 0.4%/min; see below). 2) Fluorescence intensity rose upon addition of AN1043 and then reached a plateau after 2.6 ± 0.2 min (n = 20 of 24 cells) with no further elevations in intensity. However, in manganese influx experiments, manganese quenching rates remained near 0%/min for more than 10 min after the addition of AN1043 (n = 10, see Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, AN1043 inhibition of manganese-induced quenching persisted long after autofluorescence effects should have contributed to the observed intensity changes. These data also support the idea that autofluorescence was due to drug binding to myotubes at nonspecific sites, which became saturated after several minutes. Calcium leak channel activity in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells is increased by DHPs such as nifedipine (24Fong P. Turner P.R. Denetclaw W.F. Steinhardt R.A. Science. 1990; 250: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25Turner P.R. Fong P.Y. Denetclaw W.F. Steinhardt R.A. J.

Biol. 1989; 111: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which also acts as an antagonist of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) (42Tsien R.W. Fox A.P. Hess P. McCleskey E.W. Nilius B. Nowycky M.C. Rosenberg R.L. Hille B. Fambrough D.M. Proteins of Excitable Membranes. Society of General Physiologists and Wiley-Interscience, New York1987: 167-187Google Scholar). Since DHP compounds could be either antagonists or agonists for the L-type VDCC, we reasoned that DHP analogs that were not good at inhibiting VDCC might be good antagonists for calcium leak channels. Therefore, we screened an assortment of uncommon DHP compounds for ability to lower resting [Ca2+]i levels, perhaps indicating antagonism of the calcium leak channel. Two analogs (Fig. 1), called AN406 and AN1043 reduced resting [Ca2+]i, 2J. Alderton and W. Denetclaw, Jr., unpublished results. and therefore were tested more directly for antagonism of leak channel activity. AN1043 (Fig. 2, A and B) and AN406 (Fig. 2, C-E), but not Me2SO (Fig. 2D), significantly decreased the open probability (Po) of leak channel during single channel patch analysis in myotubes conducted at 22°C. Due to variability in initial channel activity, Po before the addition of AN406 in Fig. 2C was normalized to 100%, and Po at subsequent times was expressed relative to initial Po. Data for AN406 include channels from eight mdx cell-attached patches, four mdx excised patches, and one normal excised patch. Data for Me2SO include channels from three mdx cell-attached patches, seven mdx excised patches, and one normal excised patch. As excised and cell-attached patches showed similar behavior, the data were pooled. Channel open probability was calculated using the following relationship: (mean open time)/(mean open time + mean closed time). Open and closed dwell times of the calcium leak channel are generally very fast (<1 ms) (24Fong P. Turner P.R. Denetclaw W.F. Steinhardt R.A. Science. 1990; 250: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25Turner P.R. Fong P.Y. Denetclaw W.F. Steinhardt R.A. J.

Cell. 1994; 5: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and channel amplitude is small relative to noise. Thus, sampling rate and filtering introduce some error by reducing the apparent duration of shorter open and closed time events and by causing some apparent variability in channel amplitude (see Refs. 43Yellen G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 84: 157-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 44Chua M. Betz W.J. Biophys.

Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). However, any error in measurement of open and closed time events should have affected the measured Po before and after drug addition similarly and thus do not detract from our basic observation of inhibition of leak channel activity by AN compounds. Previously, no role has been discerned for the calcium leak channel. However, this channel exhibits many properties, such as small size and conductance (7-14 pS) and voltage-independent activity (24Fong P. Turner P.R. Denetclaw W.F. Steinhardt R.A. Science. 1990; 250: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25Turner P.R. Fong P.Y. Denetclaw W.F. Steinhardt R.A. J.

Cell. 1994; 5: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which makes the channel a possible candidate for a conductance underlying a capacitative current (see Ref. 21Vaca L. Kunze D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C920-C925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether cultured myotubes exhibited a capacitative current and used AN1043 and AN406 to investigate the potential role of the calcium leak channel in this process. Fig. 3A shows changes in intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) in fura-2-loaded skeletal myotubes after the addition of 50 µM cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), an inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPases from the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum (37Mason M.J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20856-20862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As observed in other cell types (19Premack B.A. McDonald T.V. Gardner P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5226-5240PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mason M.J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20856-20862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the addition of CPA in calcium-free RRS led to a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i, which returned rapidly to base line (Fig. 3A), while the addition of CPA in RRS containing normal (1.8 mM) extracellular calcium concentrations resulted in a much greater [Ca2+]i elevation and a prolonged plateau phase after the initial [Ca2+]i peak (Fig. 3A, C-F). The addition of 10 µM AN1043 to the bath resulted in a rapid decrease in the CPA-induced [Ca2+]i plateau (Fig. 3C, 64 ± 10% decrease, n = 4). The addition of 3 mM EGTA to the bath (19Premack B.A. McDonald T.V. Gardner P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5226-5240PubMed Google Scholar) also resulted in a rapid decrease in plateau [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3, D and E, 51 ± 2% decrease, n = 8), indicating that part of the plateau calcium corresponded to the influx of calcium across the sarcolemma, presumably in response to store depletion. The CPA-induced [Ca2+]i plateau was not affected by 10 µM Gd3+ (Fig. 3D, n = 4), unlike capacitative currents in other cell types (23Hu Y. Schilling W.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but 30 µM La3+ did reduce plateau [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3F, 56 ± 2% decrease, n = 9), as observed in several cell types (8Leech C.A. Holz G. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10Chiono M. Mahey R. Tate G. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol.

Fig. 3D and 3E also show the variability in the [Ca2+]i response after CPA addition in 1.8 mM extracellular calcium. Regulation of resting [Ca2+]i is complicated by the number of molecules, such as channels, pumps, and buffers, that can affect calcium homeostasis. To assay sarcolemmal divalent cation influx more directly, we measured rates of Mn2+ entry as evidenced by quenching of fura-2 fluorescence at 357 nm. This method is used as an indirect indicator of calcium permeation in many studies (e.g. Refs. 36Mertz L.M. Baum B.J. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15010-15014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mason M.J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 39Haverstick D.M. Gray L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), since many capacitative currents also carry manganese. The addition of CPA significantly increased the rate of manganese quenching of fura-2 fluorescence intensity in cultured myotubes (Fig. 4, A and D, and Table I) and myoballs (Fig. 4C, Table I), indicating increased sarcolemmal permeation of Mn2+. Me2SO addition did not change Mn2+ quenching rates (Fig. 4B, n = 7). The Mn2+ influx induced by the addition of CPA was significantly inhibited by AN406 and AN1043 (data for 5 µM shown in Fig. 4D; data for 10 µM shown in Table II). Also, the addition of 10 µM AN406 and AN1043 significantly reduced resting Mn2+ quenching rates (e.g. see Fig. 4B). Thus, CPA increased sarcolemmal permeation of Mn2+, and both DHP analogs prevented Mn2+ entry at the sarcolemma after the addition of CPA and at rest. In Fig. 4B, 100% represented ~12,000 intensity units in the AN406 trace; the rate of fluorescence quenching by manganese was 9.7%/min before AN406 and near 0%/min after AN406. In Fig. 4C, 100% represented ~13,500 intensity units; the rate of fluorescence quenching after the addition of CPA was 6.7%/min and near 0%/min after the addition of AN1043. It is possible that stores were partially depleted by incubation in RRS containing 0.18 mM calcium (which is used to suppress spontaneous contractions as well as delay store refilling). If so, cells with depleted stores should have exhibited higher resting Mn2+ flux rates, which would correlate inversely with the amount of calcium released by CPA. However, no correlation was observed (correlation coefficient = 0.06, n = 45, p > 0.6), suggesting that myotubes maintained their store integrity in the presence of 0.18 mM external calcium. Changes in fluorescence intensity after the addition of AN1043 were not due simply to drug interactions with fura-2 or autofluorescence effects, although a small fluorescence artifact was observed after the addition of AN1043 to some cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Several lines of evidence suggest that Mn2+ influx rates in skeletal myotubes were an accurate measure of leak channel activity, and not that of some other channel, such as the VDCC. Mn2+ influx, calcium leak channel Po, and resting calcium levels were all increased by nifedipine (25Turner P.R. Fong P.Y. Denetclaw W.F. Steinhardt R.A. J.

Here, evidence is provided to support the hypothesis that charged phospholipids are required for agonist-dependent phosphorylation of receptors by GRK2. In the absence of charged phospholipids, the purified human m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (hm2mAChR) reconstituted in pure phosphatidylcholine vesicles or in a noninhibitory detergent was not a substrate for GRK2. However, these receptor preparations were stoichiometrically phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner upon addition of charged phospholipids. The known ability of G protein βγ subunits to stimulate mAChR phosphorylation also was found to be absolutely dependent on the presence of charged phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Phospholipids also regulated GRK-mediated phosphorylation of casein, a nonreceptor-soluble substrate. Among lipids tested, lipid inositol phosphates, PIP2 and phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate, were found to be the most potent activators of GRK2 and were the only lipids that regulated GRK2 in a complex biphasic manner. At low µM concentrations, PIP2 activated GRK2 via an interaction with the GRK pleckstrin homology domain; however, at high µM concentrations, PIP2 inhibited GRK2, apparently via another mechanism. PIP2-mediated inhibition could be partly relieved by increasing ATP.

https://openalex.org/W2107244189,"Fusion proteins of cytochrome P450cam with putidaredoxin (Pd) and putidaredoxin reductase (PdR), the two proteins required to transfer electrons from NADH to P450cam, were constructed by fusing cDNAs encoding the three proteins in the expression vector pCWori+. Several fusion proteins, in which the order of the three protein domains and the linkers between them were varied, were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. The highest activity (kcat = 30 min-1) was obtained with a PdR-Pd-P450cam construct in which the peptides TDGTASS and PLEL were used, respectively, to link the PdR to the Pd and the Pd to the P450cam domains. Oxygen and NADH consumption is tightly coupled to substrate oxidation in the fusion proteins. The rate-limiting step in the catalytic turnover of these fusion proteins is electron transfer from Pd to P450cam. This is indicated by high rates of electron transfer from the PdR and Pd domains to exogenous electron acceptors, by an increase in the activity of the P450cam domain upon addition of exogenous Pd, and by the high activity of wild-type P450cam when incubated with a PdR-Pd fusion protein. E. coli cells expressing the PdR-Pd-P450cam fusion protein efficiently oxidize camphor to 5-exo-hydroxycamphor and 5-oxocamphor. E. coli cells expressing the triple fusion protein thus constitute the first heterologous self-sufficient catalytic system for the oxidation of camphor and other substrates by P450cam.

E. coli cells expressing the triple fusion protein thus constitute the first heterologous self-sufficient catalytic system for the oxidation of camphor and other substrates by P450cam. Self-sufficient cytochrome P450 systems are required to harness the catalytic power of these enzymes for practical purposes, including the stereospecific synthesis of fine organic chemicals, the degradation or detoxification of hazardous compounds in the environment, and the development of plants with resistance to specific herbicides. A model for the latter use is provided by the demonstration that heterologous expression of a cytochrome P450-P450 reductase fusion protein in tobacco plants conveys resistance to the herbicide chlortoluron (1Shiota N. Nagasawa A. Sakaki T. Yabusaki Y. Ohkawa H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 17-23Google Scholar). The requirement for practical, self-sufficient catalytic systems is exacerbated by the potential utility of cytochrome P450 enzymes with tailored substrate specificities. Efforts to construct self-sufficient P450 catalytic systems have focused on the membrane-bound enzymes, for which cytochrome P450 reductase is the most common electron transfer partner. Fusion proteins of mammalian P450 enzymes with P450 reductases have been expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli (2Murakami H. Yabusaki Y. Sakaki T. Shibata M. Ohkawa H.

Fusion proteins have also been constructed in which mitochondrial cytochrome P450scc is fused to adrenodoxin, an iron-sulfur protein, and adrenodoxin reductase, a flavoprotein (12Harikrishna J.A. Black S.M. Szklarz G.D. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 371-379Google Scholar). Adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase are required to transfer electrons from NADPH to P450scc. These P450scc fusion proteins were not purified or well characterized, however, and were reported to have no activity when expressed outside of mitochondria (13Black S.M. Harikrishna J.A. Szklarz G.D. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7247-7251Google Scholar). The P450scc system is the only example so far of a three-component P450 fusion protein. Cytochrome P450cam (CYP101) (51Nelson D.R. Kamataki T. Waxman D.J. Guengerich F.P. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Gonzalez F.J. Coon M.J. Gunsalus I.C. Gotoh O. Okuda K. Nebert D.W.

The availability of crystal structures of P450cam with a variety of bound ligands and of several mutant forms of the protein make it the best structurally characterized P450 enzyme (15Poulos T.L. Howard A.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8165-8174Google Scholar, 16Raag R. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7586-7592Google Scholar, 17Raag R. Swanson B.A. Poulos T.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4571-4578Google Scholar). As such, it has served as the model for most of the mechanistic and structural advances made in the P450 field in the past decade. The wealth of information available on the P450cam system makes it an attractive candidate for the development of self-catalytic P450 systems with tailored substrate specificities. The crystal structures of three other soluble bacterial P450 enzymes have recently been determined, and the strategies developed for P450cam should be applicable to the construction of fusion proteins from two of them, P450terp (20Hasemann C.A. Ravichandran K.G. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1169-1185Google Scholar) and P450eryF (21Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Google Scholar). P450BM-3, the other soluble P450 for which a crystal structure is available, is already a fusion protein, in which the heme domain is fused to a domain with high sequence identity to P450 reductase (22Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasemann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Google Scholar). The function of cytochrome P450cam in Pseudomonas putida, the organism from which it is derived, is to catalyze the oxidation of camphor 1The abbreviations used are: camphor(1R)-camphor5-exo-hydroxycamphor(1R)-5-exo-hydroxycamphorPdRputidaredoxin reductasePdputidaredoxinPCRpolymerase chain reactionP450cam-PdR-Pdfusion protein with the three components in the indicated order connected by 7-amino acid linkersP450cam-(PG)4-PdR-PdP450cam-PdR-Pd with an 8-amino acid extension inserted into the 7-amino acid linkerPdR-Pd-P450camfusion protein with the domains in the indicated order. to 5-exo-hydroxycamphor. This hydroxylation, the first step in the degradation of camphor, makes it possible for P. putida to grow on camphor as its sole carbon and energy source (23Trudgill P.W. DuBus R. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1194-1205Google Scholar). The catalytic turnover of cytochrome P450cam requires two auxiliary proteins, the flavoprotein putidaredoxin reductase (PdR) and the iron-sulfur protein putidaredoxin (Pd) (24Katagiri M. Ganguli B.N. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3543-3546Google Scholar). These two proteins mediate the transfer of electrons from NADH to the hemoprotein. All three proteins of the cytochrome P450cam system are soluble and have been cloned and heterologously expressed in E. coli (25Koga H. Rauchfuss B. Gunsalus I.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 412-417Google Scholar, 26Unger B.P. Gunsalus I.C. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1158-1163Google Scholar, 27Peterson J.A. Lorence M.C. Amarneh B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6066-6073Google Scholar). Although P450cam has traditionally been viewed as a camphor-specific enzyme, it metabolizes a diversity of compounds in addition to camphor and camphor analogues. These compounds include styrenes, thioanisoles, ethylbenzene, nicotine, and chlorinated hydrocarbons (28Jones J.P. Trager W.F. Carlson T.J. J. Am. Chem.

A computerized search for putative substrates using the crystal structure of P450cam and the docking algorithm DOCK (35DesJarlais R.L. Sheridan R.P. Seibel G.L. Dixon J.S. Kuntz I.D. Venkataraghavan R. J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 722-729Google Scholar) has identified a number of substrates unrelated to camphor (36De Voss J.J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem.

The membrane binding properties of the available engineered fusion proteins and the absence of crystallographic data on their active sites limit their potential utility with respect to the rational design of novel catalytic systems. We describe here the expression in E. coli of soluble fusion proteins containing P450cam, Pd, and PdR domains. The fusion proteins have been purified and characterized; an analysis has been made of the rate-limiting step in their catalytic turnover; and it has been demonstrated that E. coli cells expressing one of the fusion proteins efficiently oxidize camphor. The cDNA clones for P450cam, PdR, and Pd were provided by Julian A. Peterson (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas). The cloning vector pCWori+ was provided by Eric Johnson (Scripps Institute) (37Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Biomolecular Resource Center of the University of California, San Francisco. A Perkin-Elmer 480 DNA thermal cycler was used for PCR experiments, and the PCRII™ PCR cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was occasionally used for further manipulations of the PCR product. DEAE-Sepharose and Sepharose S-200 were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Cytochrome c was from Sigma. UV-visible spectroscopy was performed on an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer. A Gilson Oxy5 Oxygraph equipped with a thermostated 1600-µl glass cuvette was used for measurements of O2 consumption. Gas chromatography was done on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 instrument equipped with a 30-m DB1 capillary column programmed to run as follows: 130°C for 3 min; 130-200°C gradient at 5°C/min; 200-250°C gradient at 10°C/min; and 250°C for 10 min. O2 consumption assays were performed in 100 mM potassium Pi buffer, pH 7.5. Activities were calculated from the camphor-dependent increase in the O2 consumption over the level observed in the absence of substrate. Cytochrome c reduction was followed spectroscopically at 550 nm in 100 mM potassium Pi buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 µM cytochrome c. The extinction coefficient difference (cytochrome cred- cytochrome cox at 550 nm) used to calculate the activity was 21 mM-1 cm-1, as determined by reducing cytochrome c with sodium dithionite. In contrast to P450cam, relatively little is known about the structures of Pd and PdR except for an NMR-derived structure of Pd (38Pochapsky T.C. Ye X.M. Ratnaswamy G. Lyons T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6424-6432Google Scholar). The details of the interactions among the three proteins remain obscure, although modeling studies suggest that Pd binds to the P450cam surface at a site immediately behind the iron-coordinated cysteine residue (39Stayton P.S. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7381-7386Google Scholar, 40Mueller E.J. Loida P.J. Sligar S.G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995: 83Google Scholar). The order of the components in the first fusion construct was based on two considerations: (a) Trp-106 at the C terminus of Pd is required for efficient electron transfer (41Davies M.D. Qin L. Beck J.L. Suslick K.S. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 7396-7398Google Scholar, 42Stayton P.S. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1845-1851Google Scholar); and (b) Arg-112 of P450cam, which is located on the surface of the protein approximately equidistant (~50 Å) from the N and C termini, is within the proposed Pd-binding site and appears to be important for electron transfer (43Koga H. Sagara Y. Yaoi T. Tsujimura M. Nakamura K. Sekimizu K. Makino R. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Yura K. Go M. Ikeguchi M. Horiuchi T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 109-113Google Scholar, 44Nakamura K. Horiuchi T. Yasukochi T. Sekimizu K. Hara T. Sagara Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1207: 40-48Google Scholar). These observations suggest the possibility that the C terminus of Pd may interact with Arg-112 of P-450cam. Pd was therefore initially placed at the C terminus of the fusion protein, as this would allow its C terminus the greatest possible degree of freedom. PdR was placed adjacent to Pd to facilitate electron transfer from one to the other, and P450cam was placed at the N terminus. To construct the initial fusion protein, the P450cam and PdR stop codons were removed, and the codons for a short peptide linker were introduced between the P450cam and PdR domains and between the PdR and Pd domains. This was done by PCR, employing 3′-primers that lacked the stop codon and carried part of the coding sequence for the amino acid linker. The 5′-primers for the adjacent protein carried the rest of the code for the linker, and both types of primers terminated in unique restriction sites that allowed the genes for the various proteins to be fused as indicated in Fig. 1. SpeI and NheI were chosen as the restriction sites for use in fusing the genes. The amino acid sequences of the linkers used in the construction of the fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 2. These sites and the sequences of the peptide linkers were the same as those used to fuse the components of the P450scc system (12Harikrishna J.A. Black S.M. Szklarz G.D. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 371-379Google Scholar). Preservation of the wild-type sequences, except for the intended mutations at the termini, was ensured by sequencing (P450cam and Pd) or by a combination of exchange of restriction fragments from the wild-type gene (PdR, PflMI-SacII fragment) and sequencing of the remainder.Fig. 2Schematic diagram showing the linkers between the protein domains in each of the fusion proteins.

A proline- and glycine-rich region close to the N terminus in membrane-bound P450 enzymes has been proposed to function as a flexible hinge between the membrane anchor and the bulk of the newly synthesized P450. The hinge may provide the enzyme with the degrees of freedom required to fold correctly while anchored to the membrane (45Yamazaki S. Sato K. Suhara K. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 652-657Google Scholar). An octa- or dodecapeptide composed of alternating prolines and glycines was therefore inserted into the heptapeptide linkers of the initial fusion protein. The 24- and 36-mer oligonucleotides encoding the (PG)4 and (PG)6 polypeptide linkers, compatible with the SpeI restriction site in sequence coding for the original heptapeptide linker, were synthesized. As shown below for the 24-mer (Sequence 1), the oligonucleotides self-anneal to form a double-stranded DNA encoding the prolines and glycines in frame with the SpeI compatible overhangs. 5′−CTAGGCCCGGGCCCGGGCCCGGGC-3′ 3′−CGGGCCCGGGCCCGGGCCCGGATC-5′ SEQUENCE 1 The linkers were inserted by digesting pCWori+-P450cam-PdR-Pd with SpeI, purifying the linearized plasmid, adding a large excess of the artificial linker, and incubating with T4 ligase. Recircularized plasmid without linker was linearized by cutting with SpeI prior to transformation. The insertion of the linker was ascertained by restriction enzyme analysis using PspAI and Asp718, which generate fragments of 178, 166, and 142 base pairs from the DNA coding for the enzyme with the (PG)6 linker, the (PG)4 linker, and the original heptapeptide linker, respectively. As analysis of the three P450cam-PdR-Pd constructs showed that the PdR-Pd domain and the P450cam domain were individually more active than indicated by the overall activity of the fusion protein, a construct was made in which the PdR-Pd fusion unit was placed in front of the P450cam domain. The PdR-Pd-P450cam construct was made essentially as described for the P450cam-PdR-Pd construct, with the same linker between the PdR and Pd domains as in the original constructs and a 4-amino acid linker between the C terminus of Pd and the N terminus of P450cam (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2). A PdR-Pd fusion protein was assembled to examine the degree to which this unit retains the ability to transfer electrons. The construction of the PdR-Pd unit made use of the fact that there is an MluI restriction site in Pd and a similar site in the pCWori+ vector. By cutting both PdR-Pd-P450cam and P450cam-PdR-Pd with MluI and ligating the small fragment of PdR-Pd-P450cam with the large fragment of P450cam-PdR-Pd, the PdR-Pd-pCWori+ construct was obtained. E. coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) was grown in 2.8-liter Fernbach flasks in 2 × YT medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg/liter). Cells were grown to A600 = 0.6-0.8 at 37°C, the temperature was lowered to 20°C, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (1 mM) was added. The culture was allowed to grow overnight (18 h) at 20°C on a rotary shaker (230 rpm). Fusion protein yields of 150-200 nmol/liter of medium are thus obtained, but they can be increased to 600-700 nmol/liter by extending the expression time. The cells collected by centrifugation were resuspended in 50 ml of cold (4°C) buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mg of lysozyme, pH 7.5. After stirring at 4°C for 2 h, the suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed at 4°C, and sonicated using a Branson sonicator (medium power output) until the viscous consistency due to the nucleic acids was disrupted (~2 min). The soluble fraction after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 25 min was loaded onto an anion exchange column (DEAE Fast Flow) equilibrated in buffer A (50 mM potassium Pi, 50 mM KCl, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5), washed extensively with buffer A, and eluted with a 0-500 mM KCl gradient in buffer A. The fractions containing the fusion protein, identified by absorption at 418 nm, were combined and concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell equipped with a YM-30 membrane prior to gel filtration chromatography (Sepharose S-200) in buffer A + 200 mM KCl. The resulting purified fusion proteins were stored on ice and used for assays within 2 days of purification. Three P450cam-PdR-Pd fusion proteins with different linkers (Fig. 2) between the P450cam and PdR domains have been expressed in E. coli. In all three proteins, the linker between the PdR and Pd domains remained the same (Fig. 2). The absorption spectra (300-600 nm) of the three fusion proteins in the ferric, ferrous, and ferrous CO-complexed states (data not shown) are almost identical to those of the corresponding states of the PdR-Pd-P450cam fusion protein (see below). The activities of the three initial fusion proteins were compared by measuring their O2 consumption in the presence and absence of camphor. A background O2 consumption of 6-8 min-1/protein molecule was measured with all the constructs when incubated with NADH in the absence of camphor. This corresponds to the O2 consumption observed when a mixture of native PdR (2 µM), Pd (8 µM), and NADH (1 mM) is incubated without P450cam or camphor. The catalytic activity of the fusion protein is determined from the increase in O2 consumption when camphor is added to the fusion protein in the presence of NADH and is thus a minimum value because uncoupled NADH consumption may decrease in the presence of the substrate. As shown by the camphor-inducible O2 consumption (Fig. 3), increasing the length of the linkers in the P450cam-PdR-Pd construct does not significantly alter the catalytic activity. The activities of the fusion proteins increase linearly with their concentration, as exemplified by P450cam-PdR-Pd (Fig. 3, inset), indicating that electron transfer from NADH via PdR and Pd to P450cam occurs via an intramolecular pathway rather than by intermolecular transfer of electrons from one fusion protein to another. The latter would produce a higher order dependence of rate on the enzyme concentration. Electron flow through the individual parts of the fusion protein can be monitored with the help of alternative electron acceptors. Experiments show that PdR and Pd are both able to reduce ferricyanide, but only Pd can reduce cytochrome c. This difference has made it possible to identify the rate-limiting step in turnover of the fusion proteins. The NADH-dependent rate of cytochrome c reduction by increasing amounts of P450cam-(PG)4-PdR-Pd has been compared with the rate of cytochrome c reduction by increasing amounts of Pd in the presence of 4 µM PdR (Fig. 4). Although the rate of cytochrome c reduction by the fusion protein is slower than that by native Pd, the fusion protein is still able to deliver electrons at a rate considerably faster than that needed to sustain the observed P450cam activity of 10 turnovers/min. Furthermore, addition of exogenous P450cam to the fusion protein stimulates O2 consumption above the levels obtainable with the fusion protein alone. The increase in O2 consumption due to addition of P450cam to the P450cam-(PG)4-PdR-Pd fusion protein is shown in Fig. 5. The Vmax value from the plot is ~600 nmol of O2/min/nmol of native P450cam, or ~30% of the value for native P450cam supplied with saturating amounts of Pd and PdR. The data clearly show that the P450cam-(PG)4-PdR-Pd fusion protein has a larger electron donating capacity at the electron-donating site of the Pd domain than is utilized by the hemoprotein domain of the fusion protein.Fig. 5Catalytic activity as determined by the O2 consumption of P450cam (0.3 µM) incubated with 1 mM NADH, 1 mM camphor, and increasing concentrations of P450cam-(PG)4-PdR-Pd. The fusion protein was the sole source of reducing in these incubations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The P450cam domain is also capable of faster turnover than indicated by the net activity of the fusion protein, as shown by the finding that the P450cam-(PG)4-PdR-Pd O2 consumption increases to 280 nmol of O2/min/nmol of fusion protein in the presence of 4 µM native Pd (data not shown). Surplus electrons can thus be donated from the PdR and Pd domains to exogenous Pd and from exogenous Pd to the P450cam domain, indicating that the interaction between the Pd and P450cam domains of the fusion protein is suboptimal. As the results with the three P450cam-PdR-Pd constructs indicated that the PdR-Pd unit of the fusion proteins works well, we constructed a binary PdR-Pd fusion protein containing only these two domains and a ternary fusion protein in which the PdR-Pd unit was placed before rather than after the P450cam domain (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The PdR-Pd-P450cam fusion protein in the presence of 500 µM camphor exhibits a normal reduced CO difference spectrum (Fig. 6, inset). The spectrum of the ferrous CO-complexed fusion protein indicates that a small fraction of the P450cam domain is in the P420 state. The ferric camphor-bound spectrum indicates that only ~50% of the P450cam domain shifts from the low to the high spin state upon substrate binding despite the high concentration of camphor (Fig. 6). The protein that remains in the low spin state may be partially denatured. Expression of the fusion protein at temperatures between 15 and 30°C reveals that the low spin component declines from ~95% at 30°C to 50% at 20°C (data not shown). Lowering the temperature below 20°C did not further increase the proportion of the protein that undergoes a low to high spin transition, but markedly decreased the expression rate. Despite attachment of the C terminus of Pd to the N terminus of P450cam, the PdR-Pd-P450cam construct is three times more active than the best of the P450cam-PdR-Pd fusion proteins (Fig. 3). The activity of PdR-Pd-P450cam increases linearly in proportion to the protein concentration, and its spectroscopic properties are almost identical to those of the reverse-order fusion proteins. The interaction between Pd and P450cam is still clearly suboptimal, however, because addition of native P450cam to the fusion protein again increases O2 consumption due to increased substrate turnover (data not shown). The ability of the binary PdR-Pd construct to support the activity of native P450cam is almost as good as that of a 4:1 ratio of the two separate proteins at the concentrations used in our standard P450cam assay (Fig. 7). Optimal interaction between the Pd and P450cam domains of a ternary fusion protein could therefore have produced an activity of 166 turnovers/min, the kcat of the PdR-Pd construct with native P450cam. Perturbation of the P450cam-substrate interaction is accompanied by partial uncoupling of O2 consumption from substrate oxidation (18Raag R. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2674-2684Google Scholar, 46Atkins W.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18842-18849Google Scholar, 47Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Koga H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28042-28048Google Scholar). The O2 not utilized for substrate oxidation is reduced to H2O2 or H2O (49Gorsky L.D. Koop D.R. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6812-6817Google Scholar). The possibility therefore exists that attachment of P450cam to the PdR-Pd domain will result in uncoupled turnover. However, the correlation between O2 consumption and camphor formation for PdR-Pd-P450cam is similar to that for the wild-type P450cam system (Fig. 8). The data suggest that slightly more than one camphor molecule is hydroxylated per molecule of NADH, but this reflects a small systematic error in the measured NADH consumption introduced by subtracting the background NADH consumption determined in the presence of the P450 inhibitor metyrapone. The catalytic oxidation of camphor appears to be as well coupled to O2 consumption in the PdR-Pd-P450cam fusion protein as it is in the native system. The activities of"

Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 575-581Google Scholar). Rhodopsin-homologous receptors transmit extracellular signals across biological membranes by activating specific signal transducing GTP-binding proteins (heterotrimeric G-proteins) that in turn regulate a variety of intracellular effector pathways (3Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Google Scholar, 4Hargrave P.A. Hamm H.E. Hofmann K.P. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 43-50Google Scholar, 5Ross E.M. Neuron. 1989; 3: 141-152Google Scholar). Agonist stimulation of the 5HT2 subfamily of serotonin receptors initiates intracellular phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and a subsequent rise in intracellular calcium (6Conn P.J. Sanders-Bush E. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 1754-1760Google Scholar, 7Conn P.J. Sanders-Bush E. Hoffman B.J. Hartig P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4086-4088Google Scholar). The 5HT2c receptor is distinguished from 5HT2a and 5HT2b by its ligand affinities and tissue distribution. The 5HT2c receptor is expressed in neurons of the central nervous system, with especially high levels of expression in the choroid plexus (8Hoyer D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1988; 9: 89-94Google Scholar). The neurotransmitter, serotonin, has been extensively studied and has been implicated in mental diseases ranging from affective and mood disorders to autism and dementia (9Sjoerdsma A. Palfreyman M.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 600: 1-8Google Scholar). As we more fully understand the physiological diversity exhibited by the large family of serotonin receptors (10Peroutka S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 45-60Google Scholar), we will gain further insights into the neuropharmacology of serotonin. 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) a member of the family of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins guanosine 5′-(3-o-thiotriphosphate) 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride HCl 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid lysergic acid diethylamide phospholipase C phosphatidylinositol dithiothreitol. Members of the 5HT2 receptor subfamily, as do other members of the extensive gene family of rhodopsin homologous receptors, signal through heterotrimeric G-proteins. Members of this receptor family, when stimulated, act to catalyze the exchange of GTP for tightly bound GDP on the G-protein α subunits, which in turn activate intracellular effectors such as adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C-β subtypes (PLC-βs). The α subunits are subclassified into four groups based upon sequence homology (11Simon M.I. Strathman M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Google Scholar, 12Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Google Scholar). At least four α gene products have been found to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis by activating PLC-βs (13Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Google Scholar); these are designated as the αq subfamily (14Sternweis P.C. Smrcka A.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 17: 502-506Google Scholar, 15Kozasa T. Hepler J.R. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9176-9180Google Scholar). Gβγ subunits have also been noted to activate PLC-βs (16Park D. Jhon D. Lee C. Lee K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4573-4576Google Scholar, 17Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Google Scholar). Because the 5HT2 subfamily of receptors stimulate PI hydrolysis it has been assumed that agonist stimulation of 5HT2c receptors leads to GDP-GTP exchange on αq which in turn activates a PLC-β isozyme(s). However, no reports have directly examined the activation of Gq proteins by 5HT2 receptors. The in vitro studies of activation of G-proteins by receptors have proven difficult. In general, difficulties relate to purification of the quantities of proteins necessary to study the molecular interactions between a single receptor and distinct G-proteins (18Cerione R.A. Ross E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 329-342Google Scholar, 19Cerione R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 473-501Google Scholar). Thus, although previous work has led to the inference that 5HT2c activates αq, the coupling of 5HT2c and αq, like that of many receptors with purified G-protein subunits, has not been studied directly. With the identification of over 100 cDNAs encoding seven transmembrane domain receptors (exclusive of olfaction) and the molecular cloning of cDNAs encoding multiple gene products for each of the G-protein subunit families, a central issue in cell regulation is how these protein families contribute to the diversity of cellular responses while conserving the specificity of each response. One level of specificity is likely encoded in the thermodynamics of distinct gene product interactions, and to examine this possibility we have in the past exploited the high chemical concentration and unique gene expression found in photoreceptor membranes (20Fawzi A.B. Northup J.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3804-3812Google Scholar, 21Fawzi A.B. Fay D.S. Murphy E.A. Tamir H. Erdos J.J. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12194-12200Google Scholar, 22Wildman D.E. Tamir H. Leberer E. Northup J.K. Dennis M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 794-798Google Scholar). To extend such studies to other G-protein-coupled receptors, we and others have turned to high level expression systems. The utility of the baculovirus expression system for obtaining reconstitutively active G-protein-coupled receptors has been described previously (23Parker E.M. Kameyama K. Higashijima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 519-527Google Scholar). However, previous investigations of recombinant G-protein-linked receptors have employed detergent solubilization of the receptor from its native membrane and subsequent reconstitution in artificial liposomes (18Cerione R.A. Ross E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 329-342Google Scholar, 19Cerione R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 473-501Google Scholar, 24Pedersen S.E. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have avoided liposome reconstitution by exploiting the utility of urea for extraction of extrinsic membrane proteins from postnuclear membrane fractions without disrupting membrane integrity. In this report we present the development of in situ reconstitution procedures for rat 5HT2c receptors expressed in insect Sf9 cells and the quantitative analysis of the catalytic activation of squid photoreceptor αq (26Pottinger J.D.D.

Our studies reveal a basal catalytic activity of this receptor that is enhanced by agonist ligands and differentially inhibited by 5HT2c receptor antagonists. The unique potential of these methods for testing theories of ligand-receptor interaction, with respect to G-protein activation, is discussed. The full-length rat 5HT2c cDNA (28Julius D. MacDermott A.B. Axel R. Jessell T.M. Science. 1988; 241: 558-564Google Scholar) was subcloned into the BacPAK8 transfer plasmid in the XbaI and EcoRI positions of the multiple cloning site. Sf9 cells were co-transfected with BSU361-digested BacPAK6 baculovirus DNA and the 5HT2c-containing recombinant BacPAK8 plasmid by standard techniques (29O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: a Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). After amplification and plaque titer of plaque-purified recombinant baculovirus, Sf9 cells, grown in suspension culture (100 rpm in a Lab-Line Environ-Shaker) with Life Technologies, Inc. Sf-900 serum-free medium at 27°C, were infected during log phase growth (1 × 106 cells/ml) with 5-10 plaque-forming units/cell. Cells were harvested 60 h postinfection by sedimentation at 500 rpm for 5 min in a Beckman TJ6 centrifuge and resuspended in 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 100 µM AEBSF at 4°C and incubated on ice for 30 min before cell lysis and membrane homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer (25 strokes with A pestle). Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 2700 rpm in the TJ6 centrifuge for 10 min, and the postnuclear fraction was collected at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman 70.1 Ti rotor for 20 min at 4°C. These membranes were either used immediately for urea extraction or resuspended in 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, at about 2 mg/ml protein and frozen at -80°C for storage. Sf9 cell membranes were extracted three times by incubation for 30 min on ice in a solution of 6 M urea dissolved in Solution A (50 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM MgSO4) at 0.75 mg/ml membrane protein followed by sedimentation at 40,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman 70.1 Ti rotor, with a final wash in Solution A without urea. The urea-washed membranes were resuspended at about 2 mg/ml protein in Solution A, and aliquots were stored at -80°C. G-proteins were isolated from bovine brain, bovine retina, and squid retina. Squid photoreceptor membranes were prepared from 100 frozen, enucleated squid eyes by thawing 25 eye cups per 35 ml of Solution B (10 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgSO4, 100 mM NaCl) with 100 µM AEBSF at room temperature. Eyes were vortexed for 1 min to separate the photoreceptor membranes from the rest of the eye cup, and all subsequent steps were carried out on ice or at 4°C. The cups were removed and the photoreceptor membranes pooled and Dounce-homogenized (B pestle with 10 strokes). The homogenate was pelleted at 20,000 rpm for 10 min in Beckman JA20 rotor and resuspended in Solution B containing 34% sucrose to a final volume of 360 ml. The resuspended homogenate was distributed in 30-ml aliquots into Beckman SW28 centrifuge tubes, overlaid with 7 ml of Solution B, and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 30 min. The photoreceptor membranes were collected as a layer floating at the sucrose interface, and the harvested membranes were washed twice by dilution to 80 ml with Solution B and centrifugation at 20,000 rpm in a Beckman JA20 rotor. The final pellet was resuspended to 40 ml with Solution B and stored at -80°C. Squid photoreceptor membranes (200 mg of membrane protein) were thawed and washed by dilution with Solution C (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT) with 100 µM AEBSF and collection at 20,000 rpm in a Beckman JA20 rotor. The washed membranes were then extracted at 1 mg/ml protein with Solution C containing 1% cholate by stirring at 4°C for 30 min. The extracted membranes were sedimented at 50,000 rpm for 1 h in a Beckman type 35 rotor, and the supernatant was collected. The pelleted fraction, which contains G-protein-depleted rhodopsin, was washed by dilution with Solution B and centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 20 min in a Beckman JA20 rotor, resuspended with Solution B, and stored at -80°C. The cholate-extracted supernatant was treated by sequential addition of MgCl2 to 11 mM, AlCl3 to 100 µM, and NaF to 10 mM (AMF) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The AMF-treated extract was then chilled and applied to a 200-ml (2.6 × 40 cm) column of DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that had been equilibrated with 3-bed volumes of Solution D (20 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1% sodium cholate, 20 µM AlCl3, and 10 mM NaF). After application of the extract, the column was washed with 1-bed volume of Solution D and then eluted with a 4-bed volume gradient from 0 to 200 mM NaCl in Solution D, collecting 100 fractions and monitoring protein concentration by absorbance at 280 nm. All chromatography was performed at 4°C. GTP-binding activity of purified αq was detected by reconstitution of chromatography fractions with squid rhodopsin, as described below, and typically eluted around 80 mM NaCl. Squid rhodopsin catalyzed GTPγS binding to a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa, as predicted for squid transducin (αq)(26). The DEAE chromatography fractions were visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pooled according to purity and activity, concentrated on Amicon PM30 membranes, and subjected to gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA44 (IBF) using Solution E (20 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2% cholate). Fractions were evaluated by functional reconstitution, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and amido black protein measurement (30Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Google Scholar). The typical yield for 100 retinas was 2 mg of purified αq. Aliquots of pooled peak fractions were stored at -80°C. When necessary, αq was concentrated on centricon 30 spin concentrators (Amicon) and desalted over G-50 resin using Solution E. βγ subunits were purified from bovine cortex (31Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Google Scholar) and, along with transducin (αt), from bovine rod outer segment discs (20Fawzi A.B. Northup J.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3804-3812Google Scholar, 32Kuhn H. Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Google Scholar, 33Fung B.K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Google Scholar) using previously published protocols. The receptor-catalyzed binding of GTPγS by squid αq was determined by modification of the method described for bovine rhodopsin-transducin (20Fawzi A.B. Northup J.K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3804-3812Google Scholar, 21Fawzi A.B. Fay D.S. Murphy E.A. Tamir H. Erdos J.J. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12194-12200Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in 12 × 75 siliconized borosilicate glass test tubes at a volume of 50 µl of Solution F (50 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 3 mM MgSO4, 1 mM DTT, 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 1 µM GTPγS with trace [35S]GTPγS (about 1000 dpm/pmol). Exchange reactions were initiated by addition of Sf9 membranes or squid rhodopsin, incubated in a 30°C water bath for varying times, stopped by addition of 2 ml of Solution G (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 25 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl) at 4°C, and immediately filtered over nitrocellulose membranes on a vacuum manifold by washing four times with 2 ml of cold Solution G. Filters were dried and radioactivity quantitated by liquid scintillation in a Wallac 1219 beta counter. 5HT2c binding sites were quantitated by analysis of [3H]mesulergine or 125I-LSD binding to membrane preparations. Radioligand binding assays were carried out in solution F at 30°C identically as functional reconstitution except that reactions were filtered over GF-C glass fiber filters. 125I-LSD was quantitated on a Wallac 1470 gamma counter. [3H]Mesulergine was counted on the Wallac 1219 beta counter. All results shown are representative of data obtained from three or more separate experiments. All curves presented were best fits to a simple exponential model for progress curves or a single site binding model for saturation isotherms using the program “Enzfitter.” The 5HT2c receptor cDNA was kindly provided by Beth Hoffman (LCB, NIMH). The baculovirus DNA and transfer plasmid were purchased from Clontech. Sf-900 serum-free medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. [N-6-methyl-3H]Mesulergine was obtained from Amersham Corp. 2-[125I]-iodo-lysergic acid diethylamide and [35S] GTPγS were from DuPont NEN. Squid (Loligo forbesi) eyes were purchased from Calamari, Inc., in Woods Hole, MA. The serine protease inhibitor, [4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride, HCl] (AEBSF), was purchased from Calbiochem. Cholic acid was obtained from Sigma and repurified as described (34Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3333-3340Google Scholar). MOPS was from Fluka. The DEAE-Sephacel and Ultrogel AcA-44 chromatography resins came from Pharmacia and IBF, respectively. Bovine serum albumin used as standard for protein measurements was from Pierce. The hydrochloride salts of mesulergine, mianserin, and ketanserin were obtained from Research Biochemicals, Inc. GTPγS was from Sigma. HAWP nitrocellulose filters and the vacuum manifold were from Millipore. The GF-C glass fiber filters were from Whatman. After co-transfection of Sf9 cells with baculoviral DNA and the 5HT2c-containing transfer plasmid, recombinant baculovirus was plaque-purified twice. Three of three isolated plaques expressed 125I-LSD-binding sites. One of these was selected, amplified, and used to obtain a viral stock that was utilized in all subsequent infections (29O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: a Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). The time course of 5HT2c receptor expression was assessed by 125I-LSD labeling of receptor sites and by activity of membranes reconstituted with αq at 12-h intervals after viral infection. We observed maximal expression at 60 h, by both receptor site abundance and functional activity (data not shown). Infecting with multiplicities of infection of 5 and 40 plaque-forming units/cell provided an equal abundance of 5HT2c receptor sites at 60 h post-infection (data not shown). 5HT2c receptor expression was diminished by 20-40% when recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were cultured in the presence of 1 µM mianserin, consistent with findings of others (35Barker E.L. Westphal R.S. Schmidt D. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11687-11690Google Scholar) (data not shown). Membranes prepared from Sf9 cells infected with the wild-type baculovirus vector did not have specific binding sites for 125I-LSD or [3H]mesulergine, and they did not catalyze GTPγS-binding to αq (data not shown). Infection of a 0.5-liter suspension culture (5 × 108 cells) yielded approximately 20 mg of total membrane protein in the postnuclear fraction. Urea extraction removed 60-70% of the membrane-associated protein. Five infections have yielded specific activities of 50-70 pmol/mg total membrane protein which were increased to 150-210 pmol/mg after urea extraction. Fig. 1 shows the results of an experiment analyzing the saturation of 5HT2c binding sites with [3H]mesulergine in urea-extracted membranes. These data are consistent with the expression of a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 5 nM for mesulergine and 190 pmol binding per mg of membrane protein in this preparation. The ability of Sf9-expressed 5HT2c receptor to couple functionally to squid photoreceptor αq was examined in the experiment presented in Table I. Urea extraction reduced the GTPγS-binding activity of the Sf9 membranes by 75%. The functional activity of the receptor to catalyze GTPγS binding by added αq was retained following urea treatment, and the ratio of this catalyzed binding to the endogenous binding of GTPγS by the membranes was increased from 3- to 10-fold. Reconstitution of membranes with βγ did not increase GTPγS binding to endogenous sites but enhanced the binding when co-reconstituted with αq, and neither αq nor βγ nor their combination bound GTPγS significantly in the absence of the 5HT2c receptor (data not shown). This is evidence for the presence of an uncoupled receptor and is also consistent with a catalytic role for βγ in 5HT2c receptor-catalyzed GTPγS-binding by αq similar to that observed for reconstitution of bovine rhodopsin with αt (21Fawzi A.B.

Open table in a new tab 5HT activated the 5HT2c receptor to increase catalysis of GTPγS binding by αq, but mianserin did not. Upon examining nonextracted membranes containing the 5HT2c receptor, we noted that the addition of 5HT did not increase GTPγS binding by the membranes. Even the addition of saturating βγ did not reveal a 5HT-stimulated GTPγS binding to endogenous Sf9 proteins while significantly enhancing that to added squid retinal αq. Although others have noted an αq endogenous to Sf9 cells (36Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Google Scholar), the rat 5HT2c receptor does not appear to couple effectively to this protein. The 5HT2c receptor in urea-extracted membranes also failed to catalyze GTPγS binding by bovine αt or bovine brain αo/αi fractions (data not shown). We also note that in both the native and urea-extracted membranes, we observed a significant enhancement of GTPγS binding to αq in the absence of added serotonin and mianserin inhibited this. The experiment in Table I utilized bovine retinal βγ in order to eliminate detergent additions necessary when reconstituting the hydrophobic βγ structures (21Fawzi A.B. Fay D.S. Murphy E.A. Tamir H. Erdos J.J. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12194-12200Google Scholar). Retinal βγ samples, as seen by comparing the activity without and with αq addition, contain no detectable αq contamination. However, we have been unable to saturate the βγ enhancement of 5HT2c activation of αq using the bovine retinal protein (data not shown). Therefore we examined the βγ dependence of this reconstitution using bovine cortical βγ preparations. In preliminary experiments we discovered that such preparations uniformly were contaminated with GTPγS binding activity which was catalyzed by the 5HT2c receptor but not by bovine rhodopsin. Neither did these preparations contain detectable pertussis toxin substrate (data not shown). We were able to remove the GTPγS binding activity from the bovine brain βγ preparations by additional chromatography over fast protein liquid chromatography phenyl-Sepharose, but these experiments were not uniformly successful. As with the retinal βγ fraction, we have failed to saturate the 5HT2c receptor with such brain βγ fractions, but we can estimate that the K1/2 is about 600 nM for these preparations. Parallel analyses of the saturation of bovine rhodopsin-αt activation by these same βγ samples indicate K1/2 values of 20-50 nM (data not shown). Our kinetic analyses of the ligand regulation of the rat 5HT2c receptor included the 5HT saturation of GTPγS exchange at differing concentrations of the receptor. Fig. 2 presents data from one of these experiments using 4 and 12 nM receptor. Consistent with a catalytic function for the receptor, the rate of GTPγS binding to αq was increased at the higher receptor concentration. The concentration of 5HT that gave half-maximal activation of the 5HT2c receptor was approximately 100 nM at both 4 and 12 nM concentrations of the 5HT2c receptor. Also seen in this experiment, as in Table I, is a significant 5HT2c membrane-catalyzed exchange in the absence of 5HT. This activity also increases proportionally with the membrane concentration. The significant “basal” activity of the recombinant 5HT2c receptor prompted us to examine antagonist pharmacology with our reconstituted system. The effects of three antagonist ligands (mianserin, ketanserin, and mesulergine) upon 5HT2c receptor-αq interactions, in the presence and absence of 5HT, are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. The results shown in Fig. 3A display the"
https://openalex.org/W1973423355,"Recently, we have demonstrated that human (h) glioma cell lines express large number of receptors (R) for interleukin 13 (IL13) (Debinski, W., Obiri, N. I., Powers, S. K., Pastan, I., and Puri, R. K. (1995) Clin. Cancer Res. 1, 1253-1258). These cells are extremely sensitive to a chimeric protein composed of hIL13 and a derivative of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE), PE38QQR. We have found that the cytotoxicity of hIL13-PE38QQR was blocked by hIL13 but not by hIL4 on the U-251 MG and U-373 MG cells, contrary to what was observed on several adenocarcinoma cell lines. In the present study, we further explored interactions between receptor for IL13 and IL4 on glioma cells. Established human glioma cell lines, such as DBTRG MG, Hs 683, U-87 MG, SNB-19, and A-172, are very susceptible to hIL13-PE38QQR, and the action of the chimeric toxin is not blocked by hIL4 on all these cells either. Also, hIL4 is not a competitor for 125I-hIL13 binding sites on glioma cells. Of interest, a corresponding hIL4-based chimeric toxin, hIL4-PE38QQR, is poorly active or not active on all the tested glioma cell lines. When active, however, hIL4 toxin action was blocked by hIL13. hIL13 is a competitor for 125I-hIL14 binding in a competitive binding assay on glioma cells. hIL13 and hIL4 did not affect the growth of the tested glioma cell lines. Human glioblastoma multiforme explant cells exhibited similar responses to the chimeric toxins and interleukins when compared with that found in established glioma cultures. Our results suggest that the hIL13R on glioma cells is expressed in one predominant form, the form that does not interact with IL4. Thus, this type of hIL13R is apparently different from the one demonstrated previously on several adenocarcinoma cell lines. Recently, we have demonstrated that human (h) glioma cell lines express large number of receptors (R) for interleukin 13 (IL13) (Debinski, W., Obiri, N. I., Powers, S. K., Pastan, I., and Puri, R. K.

INTRODUCTIONChimeric toxic fusion proteins composed of targeting ligands and bacterial toxins, such as Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE), 1The abbreviations used are: PEPseudomonas exotoxin ARreceptorhhumanrrecombinantMTS3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner saltPMSphenazine methasulfate. are rationally designed promising compounds to be used in cancer treatment (1Pastan I. Chaudhary V.K. FitzGerald D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 331-354Google Scholar). Such chimeric toxins are in the initial steps of preclinical and clinical evaluation, and prominent antitumor activities were observed (2Phillips P.C. Levow C. Catterall M. Colvin O.M. Pastan I. Brem H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1008-1015Google Scholar, 3Frankel A.E. FitzGerald D. Siegall C. Press O.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 926-932Google Scholar, 4Debinski W. Puri R.K. Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 744-748Google Scholar). The patients with relapsed brain tumors in particular appear to be very responsive to chimeric toxins (3Frankel A.E. FitzGerald D. Siegall C. Press O.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 926-932Google Scholar). PE is a multidomain/multifunctional globular protein of Mr 66,000 (5Gray B.L. Smith D.H. Baldridge J.S. Harkins R.N. Vasil M.L. Chen E.Y. Heyneker H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2645-2649Google Scholar, 6Allured V.S. Collier R.J. Carroll S.F. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1320-1324Google Scholar). Domain Ia of PE is the α2-macroglobulin receptor binding domain (7Kounnas M.Z. Morris R.E. Thompson M.R. FitzGerald D.J. Strickland D.K. Saelinger C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12420-12423Google Scholar). Domain II must be cleaved by furin (8Inocencio N.M. Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31831-31835Google Scholar) in order to activate the toxin and enable the active portion of the toxin to translocate into the cytosol (9Ogata M. Chaudhary V.K. Pastan I. FitzGerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20678-20685Google Scholar). Domain III of PE contains the ADP-ribosylation activity (10Iglewski B.H. Kabat D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2284-2288Google Scholar). This domain inactivates elongation factor 2 that leads to cell death.Cancer cells of solid tumor origins express receptors for interleukins, such as interleukin 4 (IL4), a hemopoietic growth factor, and these receptors constitute an attractive target for anticancer therapy using chimeric toxins (4Debinski W. Puri R.K. Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 744-748Google Scholar, 11Puri R.K. Siegel J. Cancer Invest. 1993; 11: 473-486Google Scholar, 12Debinski W. Puri R.K. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. J. Biol.

We have recently shown the presence of a common internalized receptor for hIL4 and hIL13 on a series of human adenocarcinoma cell lines (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar). These cell lines are killed potently by chimeric toxins composed of hIL13 or hIL4 and a derivative of PE, PE38QQR. hIL13 and hIL4 blocked reciprocally the cytotoxicities of their respective chimeric toxins. We hypothesized that the common receptor for the two cytokines on the studied adenocarcinoma cells is composed of the main 140-kDa subunit of the hIL4R (15Idzerda R.L. March C.J. Mosley B. Lyman S.D. Vanden Bos T. Gimpel S.D. Din W.S. Grabstein K.H. Widmer M.B. Park L.S. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 861-873Google Scholar, 16Harada N. Yang G. Miyajima A. Howard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22752-22758Google Scholar) and a 70-kDa hIL13-binding subunit (17Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Google Scholar). This is because (i) a chimeric toxin must be internalized in a process of receptor-mediated endocytosis in order to allow a proper toxin processing and intracellular routing that results in cell death (1Pastan I. Chaudhary V.K. FitzGerald D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 331-354Google Scholar), and (ii) the 140-kDa hIL4R has been shown to be the subunit of hIL4R that internalizes in response to hIL4 binding (16Harada N. Yang G. Miyajima A. Howard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22752-22758Google Scholar). More recently, we have found a significant overexpression of hIL13R on human glioma cells, and the glioma cells are extremely sensitive to hIL13-PE38QQR (18Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Powers S.K. Pastan I. Puri R.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1253-1258Google Scholar). Of interest, hIL4 did not block the action of hIL13-PE38QQR on the first two tested glioma cell lines unlike on solid tumor cell lines of peripheral origins (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar, 18Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Powers S.K. Pastan I. Puri R.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1253-1258Google Scholar). These findings raised a possibility of the presence of hIL13R that does not interact with IL4 and is overexpressed on some glioma cells. On the other hand, several recent reports suggested a pattern for IL13- and IL4R commonality in which cells that do bind IL13 should bind IL4, and IL13 binding is always fully competed for by IL4 (19Zurawski S.M. Chomarat P. Djossou O. Bidaud C. McKenzie A.N.J. Miossec P. Banchereau J. Zurawski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13869-13878Google Scholar, 20Vita N. Lefort S. Laurent P. Caput D. Ferrara P. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 659-665Google Scholar).In this study, we have further examined interactions between hIL13R and hIL4R in human glioma cells. We used five more established human glioma cell lines and, for the first time, cells of a human glioblastoma multiforme explant, and tested the cytotoxicities of chimeric toxins and responses to hIL13 and hIL4. Our results indicate that one predominant form of hIL13R is overexpressed on glioma cells. These results should be helpful in understanding the biology of the interleukin receptors and may be important in designing therapeutic strategies that target them.RESULTSTo construct the chimeric toxin, the coding region of the IL13 gene was fused to a gene encoding a mutated form of PE, PE38QQR (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar). PE38QQR has domain Ia and amino acids 365-380 in Ib deleted, plus the three lysine residues in domain III at positions 590, 606, and 613 are changed to two glutamines and arginine (QQR) (24Debinski W. Pastan I. Bioconjugate Chem. 1994; 5: 40-46Google Scholar). The chimeric gene is in the bacterial vector under the control of a bacteriophage T7 late promoter; the protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (λDE3) as described previously (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar). hIL4-PE38QQR (4Debinski W. Puri R.K. Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 744-748Google Scholar), hIL4-PE4E (12Debinski W. Puri R.K. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14065-14070Google Scholar), hIL4, and hIL13 were subcloned into the same expression plasmid and produced as was the hIL13-PE38QQR.hIL13-PE38QQR Is Extremely Cytotoxic to Both Established Glioma Cell Lines and Glioblastoma Multiforme Explant CellsWe tested the A-172, DBTRG MG, and Hs-683 established human glioma cell lines and, for the first time, glioma explant cells (G2) to determine and/or confirm if hIL13-PE38QQR is cytotoxic to them. All the established glioma cell lines were very responsive with an IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) of 0.1-5 ng/ml (Fig. 1). Of interest, human glioma explant cells were also extremely sensitive to the action of hIL13 toxin; the IC50 for hIL13-PE38QQR was 0.2 ng/ml (Fig. 1). The cytotoxic action of hIL13-PE38QQR was specific as it was blocked by an excess of hIL13 on all cells (18Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Powers S.K. Pastan I. Puri R.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1253-1258Google Scholar). 2W. Debinski, R. Miner, and R. K. Puri, unpublished results. These data demonstrate that both established glioma cell lines and a primary culture of glioma cells possess hIL13 binding sites and such cells are extremely sensitive to hIL13-PE38QQR chimeric toxin.hIL4 Does Not Block the Cytotoxicity of hIL13-PE38QQR on Glioma Cell Lines and Glioma Explant CellsBecause hIL13R has been shown to be related to IL4R (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar, 17Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Google Scholar, 25Zurawski S.M. Bega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Google Scholar), we explored further the specificity of hIL13-PE38QQR action on the glioma cell lines and G2 explant cells. The cells were treated with hIL13-PE38QQR with or without rhIL4 at a concentration of 1.0 µg/ml. The rhIL4 did not have any blocking action against hIL13-PE38QQR on either the established cultured cells (A-172, Hs 683, and DBTRG MG) or freshly explanted cultured glioma cells, even at a 1000-fold molar excess over the chimeric toxin (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the cell killing by the hIL13 toxin on these cells is independent of the presence of hIL4. The same results were obtained with the U-251 MG, U-373 MG (18Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Powers S.K. Pastan I. Puri R.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1253-1258Google Scholar), U-87 MG and SNB-192 cell lines.Since these data are in contrast to observations made on several adenocarcinoma cells (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar), we repeated the cytotoxicity experiments, for example, on Colo 201 human colon adenocarcinoma cells employing a colorimetric assay used in the present study (instead of tritium incorporation in Refs. 12Debinski W. Puri R.K. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14065-14070Google Scholar, 14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar, and 18) and reproduced exactly the same results.2hIL13 Blocks the Action of hIL4 Toxins on the U-251 MG, DBTRG MG, and A-172 Glioma Cells, and Glioma G2 Explant CellsTo investigate the possibility that hIL13 and IL4 may nevertheless compete, although not reciprocally, for the same binding site on glioma cells, we also treated the cells with hIL4-based recombinant toxin, hIL4-PE38QQR (4Debinski W. Puri R.K. Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 744-748Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). It has previously been demonstrated that all tested glioma cell lines express specific 140-kDa hIL4R, as determined by a immunoreactivity of an antibody raised against the protein (13Puri R.K. Leland P. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 574-581Google Scholar). We found, again unexpectedly, that hIL4-PE38QQR was without any significant specific cytotoxicity to most of these cells (Fig. 2) including the Hs-683 and U-373 MG cells.2 Only the U-251 MG glioma cell line responded relatively well to hIL4-PE38QQR with an IC50 of 10 ng/ml. This cytotoxicity was blocked efficiently by an excess of hIL13 (Fig. 2). Thus, the cytotoxicity of hIL4-PE38QQR is blocked by an excess of hIL13; however, the cytotoxic action of hIL4-PE38QQR is absent on the majority of glioma cell lines and human glioma explant cells.Fig. 2The cytotoxicity of hIL4-PE38QQR on glioma cells and blocking this cytotoxicity by hIL13. hIL13 was added at a concentration of 1.0 µg/ml.

Puri R.K. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14065-14070Google Scholar), we treated glioma cells also with hIL4-PE4E. Indeed, we have found higher cytotoxic potency of this chimeric protein when compared with hIL4-PE38QQR on several glioma cells as well as on G2 explant cells (Fig. 3). The IC50 ranged from 10 to 200 ng/ml on U-251 MG, DBTRG MG, A-172, G2 explant (Fig. 3), and U-87 MG2 cells. The cytotoxic action of hIL4-PE4E was blocked by an excess of hIL13 (Fig. 3) in a similar fashion to blocking this cytotoxicity by hIL4.2 The blocking on G2 cells was less than on other cell lines (Fig. 3), and a similar response was seen on SNB-19 cells.2Fig. 3Blocking the cytotoxicity of hIL4-PE4E by hIL13 on glioma cells. hIL13 was added at a concentration of 1.0 µg/ml. The dashed line shows 50% of the difference between the background and control MTS conversion that was recorded at A490 nm. •, hIL4-PE4E; ∘, +hIL13.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These results demonstrate that hIL4 and hIL13 have common binding sites on the glioma cell lines and are reminiscent of our previous findings on a series of adenocarcinoma cells (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar). However, there is also a profound difference between our current and previous findings, since the commonality is not reciprocal, i.e., only hIL13 is a competitor for the two receptors.Antiproliferative Effects of hIL13 and hIL4 on Glioma CellsDespite being competitors for the same binding site on some cancer cells, we have observed differences in hIL13- and hIL4-induced cellular effects (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar). Namely protein synthesis was inhibited in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner by hIL4, whereas hIL13 had no effect on these cells, even at concentrations as high as 10 µg/ml hIL13 for a 72-h incubation (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar). Similarly, hIL13 had no effect on the growth of glioma cells. The U-251 MG, U-373 MG glioma cells (Fig. 4), and G2 explant cells (Fig. 4) were unaffected by the 5-day and/or 1-week treatment with IL13. On all these cells, hIL4 had no activity on their growth either (Fig. 4).2Fig. 4hIL13 and hIL4 do not inhibit proliferation of the U-373 MG and human glioma G2 explant cells. Data represent in most cases the average of quadruplicate experiments. The dashed line shows 50% of the difference between the background and control MTS conversion that was recorded at A490 nm. •, hIL13; ∘, hIL4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)hIL13 Binding Affinity to A-172 and G2 Explant CellsIt was important to determine whether the hIL13Rs on the established glioma cell line, such as A-172 glioma cells, have different or similar binding affinity for hIL13 compared with the hIL13R that is expressed on freshly isolated cells. To investigate this, we performed competitive binding assays. As shown in Fig. 5A, unlabeled hIL13 competed for the binding of 125I-hIL13 to A-172 cells efficiently (upper panel). The Scatchard plot analysis of displacement experiments (lower panel) revealed one single binding site for hIL13 of intermediate affinity, Kd = 1.6 nM. There are 22,600 binding sites for hIL13 on the A-172 cell line. The competition of unlabeled hIL13 for the binding of iodinated ligand (Fig. 5B, upper panel) and the Scatchard analysis performed on G2 explant cells (Fig. 5B, lower panel) have shown similar results to that obtained on A-172 cells. However, the number of binding sites on explant cells is 300,000 per cell with Kd of 2.4 nM. In another experiment, the estimate of hIL13 binding sites indicated more than 500,000 binding sites per cell.Fig. 5Competitive binding assay on A-172 glioblastoma cells (A) and human glioma G2 explant cells (B). Data are expressed as a percentage of total 125I-hIL13 binding to cells (upper panel) and as a Scatchard plot (lower panel). The points are the average of two determinations. Similar data were obtained on three other established glioma cell lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Thus, there is no difference in affinity of hIL13 to its receptor whether or not cells are permanently cultured or are derived from the primary culture, although the explant cells seem to be considerably more enriched in hIL13 receptors than the established glioma cell cultures.hIL4 Does Not Compete for Labeled hIL13 Binding Sites but hIL13 Is a Competitor for 125I-hIL4 Binding Sites on Glioma CellsThe first step in a chimeric toxin action is the binding to a specific internalized receptor. Since hIL4 does not neutralize the cytotoxic activity of hIL13-PE38QQR on glioma cells, we performed standard competition experiments at 4°C using radiolabeled ligands. As seen in Fig. 6A, hIL13 displaced labeled hIL13 very efficiently on A-172 glioma cells. However, hIL4 did not compete for the binding of 125I-hIL13 at all at up to 100 nm of the competitor. On the other hand, as shown above (Fig. 2, Fig. 3), hIL13 blocked the cytotoxic actions of both hIL4-PE38QQR and hIL4-PE4E on glioma cells. Therefore, we performed a reverse competition assay and found that either interleukin was a competitor for 125I-hIL4 binding sites (Fig. 6B).Fig. 6Cross-competition between hIL13 and hIL4 for the binding sites of labeled interleukins on glioma cells. A-172 glioblastoma cells (1 × 106) were incubated with 200 pM 125I-hIL13 (A) or 125I-hIL4 (B) with or without increasing concentrations (up to 100 nM) of unlabeled hIL13 or hIL4. Bound radioactivity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are presented as a mean of % total binding of cells incubated with radiolabeled interleukins only. Total of 125I-hIL13 bound to A-172 cells was 8699 ± 11 (cpm ± S.D.), and total bound 125I-hIL4 was 5789 ± 185 (cpm ± S.D.). The experiments were performed in duplicate. Bars represent S.D. when larger than symbol. •, IL-4; ▪, IL-13.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Thus, the results of binding experiments suggest that the nonreciprocal interference of interleukins with the cytotoxic activities of their respective chimeric toxins on glioma cells is due to the nonreciprocal interference with the binding to the interleukin receptors.hIL13 Is Not a Competitor for 125I-hIL4 Binding Sites on Cells Transfected with the 140-kDa hIL4 ReceptorWe have shown that hIL13 blocks the cytotoxicities of hIL4-based chimeric toxins and competes for the binding sites of 125I-hIL4 on glioma cells. The 140-kDa hIL4R chain is believed to be a principal hIL4 binding protein. Therefore, we used cells transfected with the hIL4R (CTLLhIL4R; Ref. 15Idzerda R.L. March C.J. Mosley B. Lyman S.D. Vanden Bos T. Gimpel S.D. Din W.S. Grabstein K.H. Widmer M.B. Park L.S. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 861-873Google Scholar) and performed competition binding assays. We have found that hIL13, unlike hIL4, does not compete for the 125I-hIL4 binding sites on CTLLhIL4R cells (Fig. 7). This result was not unexpected. In similar experiments with the hIL4R transgenes, hIL13 did not compete for labeled hIL4 binding sites (e.g. Ref. 25Zurawski S.M. Bega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Google Scholar). On the other hand, hIL13 is a competitor for 125I-hIL4 cross-linking to the 140-kDa protein (17Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Google Scholar, 19Zurawski S.M. Chomarat P. Djossou O. Bidaud C. McKenzie A.N.J. Miossec P. Banchereau J. Zurawski G. J. Biol.

These results and our results obtained on glioma cells using chimeric toxins suggest that the interaction of hIL13 with the hIL4R involves more elements besides the 140-kDa hIL4R chain.Fig. 7Competition of hIL13 for the binding sites of labeled hIL4 on CTLL-2 cells transfected with the human 140-kDa IL4 receptor (CTLL-2hIL4R). CTLL-2hIL4R were incubated with 200 pM of 125I-hIL4 with or without excess hIL13 or hIL4. The results are expressed as % of total binding. Total 125I-hIL4 bound to cells was 4412 ± 344 (cpm ± S.D.). The experiments were done in duplicate and bars represent S.D. when larger than symbols. •, IL-4; ▪, IL-13.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe have found that glioma cells exhibit different responses to hIL13- and hIL4-based chimeric proteins containing PE38QQR as well as the two interleukins themselves when compared with adenocarcinoma cells (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar). All of the studied glioma cell lines are killed potently by hIL13-PE38QQR, and these killing activities are blocked specifically by an excess of hIL13. On an array of established human glioma cell lines, and represented by the U-373, U-251, DBTRG MG, Hs-683, U-87 MG, SNB-19, and A-172 cell lines, hIL4 cannot block the action of hIL13-based chimeric protein (Table I). The same phenomenon is present on primary cultured human glioma cells. Thus, there is one major form of internalized receptor for hIL13 on glioma cells that does not interact with hIL4. Of interest, a corresponding hIL13-PE38QQR hIL4-based chimeric protein, hIL4-PE38QQR, is weakly active or not active through the specific binding to the hIL4 binding protein (Table I). This is seen on the same cell lines that do respond very well to hIL13-PE38QQR. Thus, the hIL13R in glioma cells is apparently different from the one described previously (Adenocarcinomas in Table I) (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar). When hIL4-PE38QQR, or hIL4-PE4E, exerts cytotoxic activity, this activity can be nevertheless neutralized by an excess of hIL13, as seen on adenocarcinoma cell lines (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar). These data provide a new insight into the possible mechanisms of interrelatedness between hIL13R and hIL4R in glioma cells.TABLE I.Cytotoxic activities of hIL13- and hIL4-based chimeric toxins and inhibitory potencies of hIL13 and hIL4 to block these activities on cancer cellshIL13-PE38QQR, cytotoxicityhIL4-PE38QQR, cytotoxicitywithout ILswith hIL13with hIL4without ILswith hIL13with hIL4Gliomas++++aArbitrary estimate of the cytotoxic potency (+ to ++++); cytotoxicity blocked (-).-++++0/++--AdenocarcinomasbBased on data in Ref. 14.+++--+++--a Arbitrary estimate of the cytotoxic potency (+ to ++++); cytotoxicity blocked (-).b Based on data in Ref. 14Debinski W.

Open table in a new tab Studies with a mutated IL4 first suggested interrelatedness between IL13 and IL4 receptors (25Zurawski S.M. Bega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Google Scholar). Although the existence of a novel subunit that is shared between the two receptors was postulated, the same group of investigators has recently pointed to an already identified 140-kDa hIL4R chain as the component of the hIL13R (19Zurawski S.M. Chomarat P. Djossou O. Bidaud C. McKenzie A.N.J. Miossec P. Banchereau J. Zurawski G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13869-13878Google Scholar). This is in support of our previous studies (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar, 17Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Google Scholar) and that of others (20Vita N. Lefort S. Laurent P. Caput D. Ferrara P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3512-3517Google Scholar). The model system used in our protocols allows us to employ wild-type interleukins and monitor the effects of hIL4 or hIL13 on the hIL4R- and hIL13R-mediated cellular events. In such a model, we were able to show reciprocal inhibition of the cytotoxic activities of hIL4- and hIL13-based chimeric toxins by the interleukins alone (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar). We suggested that in order to explain this phenomenon, the common form of hIL13 and hIL4 receptor on the studied adenocarcinoma cells must be internalized and is composed of a 140-kDa principal subunit of the hIL4R (16Harada N. Yang G. Miyajima A. Howard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22752-22758Google Scholar) and a 70-kDa hIL13-binding protein (17Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8797-8804Google Scholar), which is in agreement with emerging consensus.Our current data on glioma cells implicate another type of hIL13R that may not involve the 140-kDa subunit of the hIL4R. Several observations speak in favor of such a possibility. First, hIL4-PE38QQR has a very weak activity on most of the glioma cells tested. This result is surprising, since hIL4-PE38QQR tended to be more active from the corresponding hIL13 toxin on several adenocarcinoma cell lines (14Debinski W. Obiri N.I. Pastan I. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16775-16780Google Scholar). Therefore, glioma cells should express relatively low levels of hIL4 binding sites (as compared with number of hIL13 sites) that, in fact, has already been documented (13Puri R.K. Leland P. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 574-581Google Scholar). However, even at these levels of hIL4R expression we would expect better cytotoxic activity of hIL4-PE38QQR on these cells (Table I). Second, we have recently shown the lack of involvement of the 140-kDa chain in a hIL13-evoked growth-inhibitory effect on human renal cell carcinoma cells (28Obiri N.I. Husain S.R. Debinski W. Puri R.K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Third, hIL4 is deprived of any ability to influence"

The predicted Cux-2 protein contained 1426 amino acids and included three internal 60-amino acid repeats (Cut repeats) that were previously found in Drosophila Cut and murine Cux-1. Unlike Cux-1, expression of Cux-2 was restricted to neural tissue. In the adult brain, Cux-2 was prominently expressed in neurons in the thalamus and limbic system. In embryos, Cux-2 was expressed in the developing central and peripheral nervous systems, including the telencephalon and peripheral ganglia of the trigeminal and glossopharyngeal nerves. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal Cut repeat and homeodomain of Cux-2 exhibited sequence-specific binding to oligonucleotides derived from the promoter of the Ncam gene. Using an interspecific backcross panel, Cux-1 and Cux-2 were mapped to distinct loci that were genetically linked on distal chromosome 5. These results demonstrate that a family of homeobox genes related to Drosophila cut is located on chromosome 5 in the mouse.

The homeobox is a 183-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)d.p.c.days post coitusEMSAelectrophoretic mobility-shift assaysCDPCCAAT displacement proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseRFLPrestriction fragment length polymorphismISHin situ hybridizationPCRpolymerase chain reaction. nucleotide sequence that encodes a DNA-binding motif called the homeodomain (1Scott M.P. Tamkun J.W. Hartzell III, G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 24-48Google Scholar). Homeobox genes were first identified in the Antennapedia/Bithorax complexes of Drosophila melanogaster but have subsequently been found in higher metazoans including Xenopus, rodents, and humans. In general, homeobox genes can be classified into the Antennapedia (Antp)-type genes and the diverged (non-Antp-type) genes (2Kappen C. Schughart K. Ruddle F.H. Genomics. 1993; 18: 54-70Google Scholar, 3Duboule D. Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar). Antp-type homeobox genes, which include the Drosophila HOM genes and the evolutionarily related mammalian Hox genes, are clustered on the chromosome(s) and encode homeodomains that are structurally similar (60-90% identical) to the archetypal Drosophila Antp gene. Antp-type homeobox genes are primarily expressed in mesoderm and ectoderm at developmentally defined stages, and loss-of-function mutations of Antp-type genes perturb anteroposterior pattern formation and specification of body segment identity (4McGinnis W. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Google Scholar). The diverged (non-Antp-type) homeobox genes, such as members of the POU, engrailed, paired, and caudal families, are not clustered on the chromosome and encode homeodomains that are less similar in sequence (<60% identical) to Antp. The spatiotemporally restricted patterns of expression of diverged homeobox genes and the phenotypes that result from alterations in their expression indicate that these genes are also important in developmental processes during embryogenesis (3Duboule D. Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar, 5Manak J.R. Scott M.P. Dev.

The cut locus of Drosophila contains a diverged homeobox gene that is essential for development of the peripheral nervous system and other tissues. Deletions of the centromere-proximal region of the cut locus disrupt development of the peripheral nervous system and are embryonic lethal. The peripheral nervous system of Drosophila consists of sensory organs that are of two types: external sensory neurons which comprise mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors, and chordotonal neurons which are proprioreceptive. Null mutations or deletions of the cut gene cause the homeotic transformation of external sensory organs into ectopic chordotonal organs (6Bodmer R. Barbel S. Sheperd S. Jack J.W. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1987; 51: 293-307Google Scholar). Moreover, ubiquitous expression of cut in Drosophila embryos specifically transforms chordotonal organs into ectopic external sensory organs (7Blochlinger K. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1124-1135Google Scholar). Thus, cut is required for specification of neuronal identity in external sensory organs comprising the peripheral nervous system. The cut gene product is a protein of 2,175 amino acids that contains several distinctive structural features including a diverged homeodomain near the carboxyl terminus, three internal repeats (called Cut repeats) consisting of 60 amino acids with 55-68% amino acid identity, and acidic domains near the amino terminus (8Blochlinger K. Bodmer R. Jack J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1988; 333: 629-635Google Scholar). Antibodies to Cut recognize 280- and 320-kDa proteins that have a restricted distribution in Drosophila embryos (9Blochlinger K. Bodmer R. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1322-1331Google Scholar, 10Liu S. McLeod E. Jack J. Genetics. 1991; 127: 151-159Google Scholar). The antibodies label nuclei of cells comprising external sensory organs but not chordotonal organs (8Blochlinger K. Bodmer R. Jack J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1988; 333: 629-635Google Scholar). Cut protein is also present in the nuclei of epithelial cells lining Malpighian tubules, cells surrounding the anterior and posterior spiracles, and many cells in the central nervous system (9Blochlinger K. Bodmer R. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1322-1331Google Scholar, 10Liu S. McLeod E. Jack J. Genetics. 1991; 127: 151-159Google Scholar). In the developing embryo, Cut protein is present in external sensory organ precursor cells and the anlagen of the Malpighian tubules in the hindgut. Null mutants of cut produce either no Cut protein or truncated proteins with an aberrant cytoplasmic localization. In mutants with absent or cytoplasmic localization of Cut, external sensory organs are transformed into chordotonal organs (9Blochlinger K. Bodmer R. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1322-1331Google Scholar). In addition, null mutants fail to develop Malpighian tubules and exhibit incomplete air-filling of the trachea and loosening of commissural bundles in the central nervous system (10Liu S. McLeod E. Jack J. Genetics. 1991; 127: 151-159Google Scholar, 11Blochlinger K. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Development. 1993; 117: 441-450Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that the Cut protein is required for normal development of the peripheral and central nervous systems, Malpighian tubules, and spiracles. A homologue of Drosophila Cut has been identified in the mouse, human, and other mammals (12Neufeld E.J. Skalnik D.G. Lievens P.M.J. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Google Scholar, 13Valarchá I.

The murine homologue, named Cux-1, 2The murine cut homologue previously cloned by Valarchá et al. (13Valarchá I. Tissier-Seta J.-P. Hirsch M.-R. Martinez S. Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Development. 1993; 119: 881-896Google Scholar) was named Cux in accordance with the nomenclature recommendations of Scott. Because our studies reveal the existence of at least two murine cut homologues, we refer to the homologue cloned by Valarchá et al. as Cux-1. Cux-2 refers to the second cut homologue reported herein. The corresponding gene symbols assigned by the International Committee on Standardized Nomenclature for Mice are Cutl1 and Cutl2, respectively. was cloned from neuroblastoma cells and identified as a transcriptional repressor of the neural cell adhesion molecule gene (Ncam) (13Valarchá I. Tissier-Seta J.-P. Hirsch M.-R. Martinez S. Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Development. 1993; 119: 881-896Google Scholar). The human homologue encodes CCAAT displacement protein (CDP), a transcriptional repressor that is involved in tissue-specific expression of cytochrome b heavy chain (gp91-phox) and Aγ-globin (16Superti-Furga G. Barberis A. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3099-3107Google Scholar, 17Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Google Scholar). These Cut homologues contain three internal Cut repeats in addition to a Cut-related homeodomain and are widely expressed in neural and non-neural tissues (12Neufeld E.J. Skalnik D.G. Lievens P.M.J. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Google Scholar, 13Valarchá I. Tissier-Seta J.-P. Hirsch M.-R. Martinez S. Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Development. 1993; 119: 881-896Google Scholar, 14Andres V.

Sequence comparisons among the Cut homologues cloned to date indicate that they are products of orthologous genes in different species. We now report the cloning of a second, novel murine Cut homologue (named Cux-2) that exhibits neural-specific expression and is encoded at a distinct chromosomal locus. Preliminary accounts of this work have been published in abstract form (19Quaggin S.E. Bodmer R. Igarashi P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 85Google Scholar). Cut homologues were amplified using PCR with degenerate primers (5′-GARGARCARAARGARGCNYT-3′ and 5′-CATNCKRTGRTTRTGRAACCA-3′). The template was 1 µg of genomic DNA that was isolated from liver by homogenization in liquid nitrogen, chloroform-phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Conditions for PCR were as described previously (20Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418Google Scholar). 45 cycles of incubation at 94°C for 1 min, 42°C or 52°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min were performed. Reaction products were resolved on low melting agarose gels, and products of the desired length were cloned into pBluescript. After verifying the sequence of the PCR products, mouse brain cDNA libraries in λgt10 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA; catalog no. ML1034h) or Uni-ZAP XR (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA; catalog no. 937314) were screened with the 32P-labeled PCR product. Methods for library screening were similar to those described previously (20Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418Google Scholar), except that hybridization was performed at 42°C in Church-Gilbert medium (0.5 M Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mM EDTA, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin) containing 30% formamide and 100 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The stringent wash was 0.1 × SSC (0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate (pH 7.0)) containing 0.5% SDS at 65°C. Positive clones were plaque-purified, and bacteriophage DNA was prepared from plate lysates using silica columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). cDNA inserts were gel-purified, cloned into pBluescript, then sequenced as described previously (20Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418Google Scholar). Additional cDNA clones containing the 5′ end of the transcript were obtained using ligation-anchored PCR as described previously (20Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from murine tissues, electrophoresed, and transferred to nylon filters (GeneScreen Plus, DuPont NEN) as described previously (20Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418Google Scholar). Northern blots were hybridized with the Cux-2 cDNA clone λ9 (containing nucleotides 3433-4268 in Fig. 1) which was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random primer extension. Hybridization was performed overnight at 42°C in Church-Gilbert medium containing 20% formamide, 100 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 2 × 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled probe. Filters were washed for 30 min in 2 × SSC at room temperature, then 30 min in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 65°C. Autoradiography was performed for 1 week at -70°C with a single intensifying screen. Northern blots were then stripped and rehybridized with the 1.3-kb PstI fragment of pRGAPD-13 encoding rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (21Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. El Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Google Scholar) using hybridization and washing conditions described previously (20Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418Google Scholar). 33P-Labeled riboprobes were synthesized as described previously (20Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418Google Scholar). Antisense and sense riboprobes were synthesized from the linearized Cux-2 cDNA clone λ9 using T7 and T3 RNA polymerase, respectively. 10-µm thick cryosections of mouse embryos or adult brains were hybridized overnight with radiolabeled antisense or sense riboprobes (3 × 106 cpm), then washed as described previously (20Igarashi P. Vanden Heuvel G.B. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F405-F418Google Scholar). Sections were dipped in Ilford K5D emulsion, exposed in the dark at 4°C, then developed with Kodak D-19. Slides were counterstained with methylene blue/azure A, then photographed with Kodak TMAX black and white print film. In some experiments (Fig. 6), ISH in paraffin-embedded tissue sections was performed using digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes that were transcribed from a 333-bp XmnI/XbaI restriction fragment of λ9 (nucleotides 3936-4268 in Fig. 1). Paraffin sections of adult mouse brain obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI) were deparaffinated in xylene then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series. Sections were rinsed with 2 × SSC, then overlaid with hybridization buffer (4 × SSC, 50% formamide, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 5% dextran sulfate, 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.25 mg/ml yeast tRNA) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The solution was replaced with hybridization buffer containing digoxigenin-labeled probe, then slides were covered with glass coverslips and incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at 37°C. Sections were washed in 2 × SSC for l h at room temperature, 1 × SSC for 1 h at room temperature, 0.5 × SSC for 30 min at 37°C, and 0.5 × SSC for 30 min at room temperature. For detection of hybridized probe, sections were washed briefly in buffer 1 (100 mM Tris-Cl (pH 6.5), 150 mM NaCl), then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the same solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100. Alkaline-phosphatase conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody was added at a final dilution of 1:500, and the slides were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were washed twice for 15 min in buffer 1 at room temperature, then incubated in 100 mM Tris-Cl (pH 9.5), 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, containing 0.55 mM 4-nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.55 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and 1 mM levamisole at room temperature for 20 min to 4 h in the dark. The reaction was stopped with 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) and 1 mM EDTA, and the sections were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series. Slides were mounted in Permount and photographed with Kodak Ektachrome color slide film. A 600-bp sequence encoding the third Cut repeat and homeodomain of Cux-2 (nucleotides 2944-3543 in Fig. 1) was amplified from a cDNA clone using PCR, then directionally cloned into the SalI and BamHI sites of pGEX4T3 which encodes glutathione S-transferase (GST). The orientation of the sequence and the integrity of the reading frame were verified by dideoxy sequencing. Transformed bacteria were grown to mid-log phase, and fusion protein synthesis was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration 0.1 mM). Cells were incubated for an additional 2-3 h, then harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 50 µl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/ml of culture, then lysed by sonication (4 min at 30% pulse mode on a Branson Sonifier 250). Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the lysate was mixed gently for 30 min at 4°C. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and 100 ml of supernatant was mixed with 2 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads. After incubation with gentle agitation at room temperature for 30 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed three times with 10 bed volumes of phosphate-buffered saline, then the fusion protein was eluted by the addition of 1.0 ml of glutathione elution buffer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and incubation with gentle agitation at room temperature for 10 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was saved. Elution was repeated three times. Fusion protein synthesis was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified using a modified Bradford assay. Oligonucleotides were synthesized containing nucleotides -589 to -563 of the proximal 5′-flanking region of the murine Ncam gene (5′-CTTTGAAAATCGAACCGAATCTAAAAT-3′) (22Hirsch M.R. Gaugler L. Deagostini-Bazin H. Bally-Cuif L. Goridis C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 1959-1968Google Scholar) or a mutated sequence (5′-CTCATCTTAGCATCGGTACGATGTTTC-3′) (13Valarchá I. Tissier-Seta J.-P. Hirsch M.-R. Martinez S. Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Development. 1993; 119: 881-896Google Scholar). 5 mM solutions of sense and antisense oligonucleotides in STE (0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)) were annealed by heating to 85°C and cooling to 20°C over 6 h. The resulting double-stranded oligonucleotides had protruding 5′ ends that were end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dTTP using Klenow fragment (specific activity 4-40 × 106 cpm/µg). Radiolabeled probes were centrifuged through Sepharose G-25 or G-50 columns prior to use. EMSA was performed using either 10 or 100 ng of purified Cux-2 fusion protein and 1-10 ng (40,000-50,000 cpm) of end-labeled oligonucleotide. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min in 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 6.5), 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol in a final volume of 20 µl. Some reactions contained 10 or 100 ng of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor or increasing amounts (10-1000 ng) of unlabeled oligonucleotide as specific competitor. Samples were preincubated with specific or nonspecific competitor for 5 min at room temperature prior to addition of radiolabeled probe. Reactions containing 100 ng of bovine serum albumin or 500 ng of GST substituted for the Cux-2 fusion protein were performed as negative controls. Following binding, samples were immediately loaded on nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels and separated by electrophoresis at 8 V/cm for 2 h in 0.5 × TBE (45 mM Tris borate, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)) at 4°C. Gels were dried, and radiolabeled bands were visualized by autoradiography. Chromosomal mapping of the murine Cux-1 and Cux-2 genes was performed using The Jackson Laboratory interspecific backcross panel BSB (23Rowe L.B. Nadeau J.H. Turner R. Frankel W.N. Letts V.A. Eppig J.T. Ko M.S.H. Thurston S.J. Birkenmeier E.H. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 253-274Google Scholar). The panel consists of genomic DNA from 94 N2 progeny from a cross between (C57BL/6J × Mus spretus) F1 hybrid females and C57BL/6J males. Genomic DNA (5-10 µg) from the parental strains and backcross progeny was digested with restriction endonucleases, electrophoresed through 1% agarose gels, then transferred to nylon membranes. Southern blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNAs encoding Cux-1 and Cux-2. The Cux-1-specific probe was a 1.5-kb cDNA (containing nucleotides 2224-3720 in GenBank™ accession no. X75013). The Cux-2-specific probe was the cDNA clone λ9. Hybridization was performed at 42°C in Church-Gilbert medium containing 30% formamide, 100 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and radiolabeled probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml). Filters were washed in 2 × SSC at room temperature for 20 min, and 0.1 × SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 65°C for 20 min, then exposed for 6 days to Kodak X-Omat AR film at -70°C with a single intensifying screen. Statistical analysis was performed using Map Manager version 2.6 (24Manly K.F. Mamm. Genome. 1993; 4: 303-313Google Scholar). Mice (strains CD-1 or C57BL/6J) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) or Charles River (Wilmington, MA). To obtain embryos at defined developmental stages, mice were randomly mated, and the morning of detection of copulatory plugs was designated 0.5 d.p.c. At selected times, pregnant mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the embryos were removed. Gestational age was verified according to the criteria of Theiler. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Yale Program for Critical Technologies and purified by OPC cartridges (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Restriction endonucleases, DNA-modifying enzymes, and polymerases were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Boehringer Mannheim, or Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Taq DNA polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer Corp. Radionucleotides were from Amersham Corp. Digoxigenin-UTP and alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody were from Boehringer Mannheim. pBluescript II KS(+) was from Stratagene. pGEX4T3 and glutathione-agarose were from Pharmacia. Other reagents were of molecular biological grade from Sigma, Boehringer Mannheim, or U. S. Biochemical Corp. At the time these studies were initiated, no mammalian cut homologues had yet been cloned. Accordingly, murine cut homologues were amplified using PCR with degenerate primers. The sequences of the primers were based on the homeobox of Drosophila cut and mouse codon usage: The 5′ primer was a 256-fold degenerate mixture of 20-mers encoding the amino acid sequence EEQKEAL, which is unique to cut. The 3′ primer was a 128-fold degenerate mixture of 21-mers encoding the sequence WFHNHRMD, which contains four amino acids (underlined) that are conserved in all homeodomains. Amplification of mouse genomic DNA yielded products of 300, 135, and 100 bp (not shown). Since the expected size was 135 bp based on the Drosophila sequence, the 135-bp PCR products were cloned into pBluescript and sequenced. Of 26 independent transformants, six were identical to Cux-1 which was cloned independently by Valarchá et al. (13Valarchá I. Tissier-Seta J.-P. Hirsch M.-R. Martinez S. Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Development. 1993; 119: 881-896Google Scholar). Four transformants contained a novel cut-related sequence, which we named Cux-2. 16 transformants contained inserts that were not related to cut and were not characterized further. The Cux-2 PCR product was used to screen two brain cDNA libraries, and 14 independent clones were obtained. Additional cDNA clones derived from the 5′ end of the transcript were obtained using ligation-anchored PCR. Fig. 1 shows the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of murine Cux-2. 3The nucleotide and amino acid sequences described in this report have been deposited in the GenBank™ data base (accession no. U45665). There was a single, long open reading frame that was predicted to encode a protein comprised of 1426 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 155 kDa, which was similar to the predicted sizes of murine Cux-1 (144 kDa) and human CDP (165 kDa). The initiation codon was identified by the presence of a Kozak (25Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Google Scholar) consensus sequence and an upstream, in-frame termination codon. At the 3′ end, we obtained several clones that were identical in the region of overlap but diverged thereafter. One clone had the sequence shown in Fig. 1 which was followed by a poly(A) tail. Two other clones contained the sequence shown in Fig. 1 followed by distinct A-rich sequences: 5′-(A)9CAAACTCCCCC-3′ or 5′-AAAAACTTT(A)19GTTTAAGAAGCAAATTGCAGAGGGAGGAAGCATTGAC(T)7CCC-3′. Since none of these sequences contained a consensus polyadenylation signal, it was likely that the cloned 3′-untranslated region was incomplete. Overall, the nucleotide sequence of murine Cux-2 was 65% identical to murine Cux-1. The deduced amino acid sequence of Cux-2 was 48% identical (63% similar) to murine Cux-1 and 29% identical (50% similar) to Drosophila Cut. In contrast, the amino acid sequence identity among the orthologues of Cux-1 in mouse, human, rat, and dog was 81-96% (86-97% similarity). Near the carboxyl terminus, Cux-2 contained a homeodomain that was structurally similar to murine Cux-1 and Drosophila Cut. Fig. 2 shows the alignments of the homeodomain of Cux-2 with Cux-1 and Drosophila Cut. The homeodomain of Cux-2 was 75% identical (79% similar) to murine Cux-1 and 47% identical (61% similar) to Drosophila Cut. In contrast, the homeodomain of Cux-2 was less similar (33% identical) to the archetypal Antennapedia sequence and Hoxb-7 (not shown). Important structural features of the 61-amino acid homeodomain include four amino acids that are invariant (Trp-48, Phe-49, Asn-51, and Arg-53) (1Scott M.P. Tamkun J.W. Hartzell III, G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 24-48Google Scholar). These residues reside in the so-called recognition helix which interacts with the major groove of DNA (Fig. 2, helix 3). The homeodomain of Cux-2 contained these four invariant amino acids (indicated by ▾). Another eight positions are highly conserved but not invariant and include position 5 (Arg or Gly), 12 (usually Gln), 16 (Leu or Val), 20 (Phe or Tyr), 40 (Leu or Asn), 45 (Ile or Val), 55 (Lys or Arg), and 57 (Lys or Arg) (1Scott M.P. Tamkun J.W. Hartzell III, G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 24-48Google Scholar). At these conserved positions (indicated by ∘ in Fig. 2), the sequences of Cux-2, Cux-1, and Drosophila Cut were identical or differed by a conservative amino acid substitution. In addition, Cux-2 contained a histidine at position 50 of the homeodomain, which was unique to Cut and Cux-1. In addition to the Cut-related homeodomain, Cux-2 contained three 60-amino acid internal repeats (Cut repeats) that were previously identified in Cux-1 and Drosophila Cut. Fig. 2 shows that the first Cut repeat of Cux-2 was 58% identical to Drosophila Cut and 88-91% identical to Cux-1. The second Cut repeat was 68% identical to Drosophila Cut and 98% identical to Cux-1. The third Cut repeat was 68% identical to Drosophila Cut and 97-98% identical to Cux-1. Sequence similarity between Cux-2, Cux-1, and Drosophila Cut was highest near the carboxyl-terminal ends of the Cut repeats. As shown in Fig. 2, sequence similarity extended beyond the borders of the Cut repeats, as originally defined by Blochlinger et al. (8Blochlinger K. Bodmer R. Jack J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 19"

Since the Escherichia coli clones isolated did not show appreciable enzyme activity, plasmids for high level expression of cloned genes were constructed. The enzyme expressed in E. coli was indistinguishable from the wild-type glycerol dehydrase of K. pneumoniae by the criteria of polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic, immunochemical, and catalytic properties. It was also shown that the recombinant functional enzyme consists of Mr 61,000, 22,000, and 16, 000 subunits. Sequence analysis of the genes revealed four open reading frames separated by 2-12 bases. The sequential three open reading frames from the first to the third (gldA, gldB, and gldC genes) encoded polypeptides of 555, 194, and 141 amino acid residues with predicted molecular weights of 60,659(alpha), 21,355(beta), and 16,104(gamma), respectively. High level expression of these three genes in E. coli produced more than 14-fold higher level of fully active apoenzyme than that in K. pneumoniae. It was thus concluded that these are the genes encoding the subunits of glycerol dehydrase. The deduced amino acid sequences of the three subunits were 71, 58, and 54% identical with those of the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of diol dehydrase, respectively, but failed to show any apparent homology with other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2063708608,"A cDNA encoding a protein designated as LIG-1 has been cloned and characterized. A fragment of this cDNA was found previously in a screen for genes up-regulated during neural differentiation in mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Comparative sequence analysis revealed LIG-1 to be a novel integral membrane glycoprotein (1091 amino acids) containing an extracellular region (794 amino acids) with a potential signal peptide, 15 leucine-rich repeats, 3 immnunoglobulin-like domains, and 7 potential N-glycosylation sites, a transmembrane region of 23 amino acids, and a cytoplasmic region of 274 amino acids. This protein, therefore, is a new member of both the leucine-rich repeat and the immunoglobulin superfamilies. Furthermore, Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses showed LIG-1 gene expression to be predominantly in the brain, restricted to a small subset of glial cells such as Bergmann glial cells of the cerebellum and glial cells in the nerve fiber layer of the olfactory bulb. On the basis of its structural features and expression pattern, we propose that LIG-1 functions as a cell type-specific adhesion molecule or receptor at the glial cell surface, and plays a role in the nervous system in for example neuroglial differentiation, development, and/or maintenance of neural functions where it is expressed.

Neural differentiation and development are complex processes which are highly regulated by a program of differential gene expression. A large number of genes (or gene products) are thought to be involved in these processes. To date, however, only a limited number of such genes have been identified. Therefore, isolation and characterization of differentially expressed novel genes is an important approach to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes as well as for functional analysis of known genes. To isolate novel genes which may play roles in mammalian neural differentiation and development, we used mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells as an in vitro model system (1McBurney M.W. Rogers B.J. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and attempted to isolate candidate genes of which steady-state expression levels were specifically up-regulated in retinoic acid (RA) 1The abbreviations used are: RAretinoic acidGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinLRRleucine-rich repeatp.c.postcoitumbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s). -treated P19 cells, which ultimately differentiate into neurons and glial cells (2Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V.

Using a novel differential gene screening method, ESD, developed by us (4Suzuki Y. Sato N. Tohyama M. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we isolated 11 cDNA fragments corresponding to transcripts that were up-regulated specifically in RA-treated P19 cells committed to neural differentiation. Our preliminary studies indicated that one of these cDNA fragments, designated as GA3-43 (218 bp), was likely to be derived from a novel gene since its partial nucleotide sequence showed no significant homology to known genes (4Suzuki Y. Sato N. Tohyama M. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The GA3-43 transcript was also found to be expressed in the mouse brain. In this study, we report the isolating of the full-length cDNA, the structural properties of the deduced amino acid sequence, and its gene expression pattern. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this cDNA revealed that it encodes a novel integral membrane glycoprotein, designated as LIG-1, belonging to both the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamilies which is expressed specifically in a small subset of glial cells in the mouse brain. On the basis of the structural features shared by the superfamilies and its restricted expression pattern, the possible function of LIG-1 in the nervous system will also be discussed. Embryonal carcinoma P19 cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ICN). The cultures were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere (1McBurney M.W. Rogers B.J. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Differentiation was carried out as follows. Cells in the exponential growth phase were treated with 0.025% trypsin and 1 mM EDTA in Ca2+-free and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline to remove them from the substratum of the tissue culture dishes. They were aggregated by plating at a concentration of 105 cells/ml into bacterial-grade Petri dishes in the presence of 1 µM RA (Sigma) or 1% (v/v) Me2SO (Nacalai Tesque). After 2 days of incubation, the drug was removed, and the aggregates were plated onto tissue culture-grade dishes (2Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. McBurney M.W. Rogers K.A. Kalnins V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 3McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M.V. Edwards M.K.S. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). All common techniques and routine DNA manipulations including transformation, plasmid preparation and gel electrophoresis were carried out according to standard procedures (5Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction and modification enzymes (Takara and New England Biolabs) were used in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations. The ESD method for isolating up-regulated genes in RA-treated P19 cells was described previously (4Suzuki Y. Sato N. Tohyama M. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, gene expression in 48-h RA-treated P19 cells was compared with those in undifferentiated and 48-h Me2SO-treated P19 cells: cDNA fragments derived from RA-treated cells (tracer) were subtracted with each of those from undifferentiated, Me2SO-treated, and the self (RA-treated) samples as a driver. The resultant tracers were each separated side-by-side on a sequencing gel, and compared. Candidates were identified by this gel analysis. The differential expression patterns of the candidates were confirmed by Northern blot analysis. A mouse brain cDNA library constructed in the cloning vector ZAPII (primed with oligo(dT) or random hexamer; Stratagene) (approximately 1 × 106 recombinant phages) was screened in duplicate using probes radiolabeled by random priming (6Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16456) Google Scholar). Probes (>2 × 105 cpm/ml) were hybridized to the phage DNA immobilized on nylon filters (Hybond-N+, Amersham Corp.) in a solution containing 6 × SSC (0.9 M NaCl, 90 mM sodium citrate), 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, and 100 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA (65°C, 20 h), and finally washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65°C. The filters were then exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat AR, Eastman Kodak Co.) in cassettes overnight at -70°C with intensifying screens. Positive phages were identified by autoradiography, purified by secondary screening, and extracted by a standard method (5Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Insert cDNAs in positive phages were excised in vivo by plasmid rescue of pBluescript SK(-) phagemid after superinfection with an R408 helper phage as recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene). For subsequent sequence analysis, a set of deletion clones was prepared from these insert cDNAs using a Kilo-sequencing deletion kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy chain-termination method (7Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51649) Google Scholar), using a Taq dye primer cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequences were analyzed with an ABI 373A automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The final sequence was confirmed from both strands. Sequence homology searches and comparison were performed using NCBI (the National Center for Biotechnology Information) E-mail server, FASTA, and BLAST (BLASTX) E-mail server on Genome Net and molecular analysis systems in DDBJ (the DNA Data Bank of Japan) (8Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (64694) Google Scholar, 9Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9224) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from differentiating P19 cells (undifferentiated, RA-treated, and Me2SO-treated P19 cells) and various mouse organs by the acidic guanidium isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (10Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62307) Google Scholar) using a total RNA separator kit (Clontech). Ten-µg aliquots of total RNA were denatured and subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde (5Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The gels were stained with ethidium bromide to verify equivalent loading and integrity of the RNA. RNA was then capillary-transferred onto positively charged polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-N, Millipore) and cross-linked by UV irradiation using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). A cDNA fragment (0.76-kb BglII-XhoI fragment, see Fig. 1A) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (>3000 Ci/mM, Amersham) using a random primer DNA labeling kit (Takara) as recommended by the manufacturer and used as a probe (6Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16456) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out in a solution containing 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, and 100 µg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA (65°C, 20 h). The filters were washed in 2 × SSC with 0.5% SDS at 65°C for 1 h, and then washed in 0.1 × SSC with 0.5% SDS at 65°C for 1 h, and exposed to imaging plates (Fuji photo film Co.) in a cassette for 5 h. The results were analyzed using a Fujix Bio-imaging analyzer BAS2000. Frozen sections (14 µm thick) of adult mouse brain and mouse embryos (12, 14, 16, and 18 days postcoitum (p.c.)) were cut in various planes and thaw-mounted onto gelatin-coated slides. 35S-Labeled or digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes (antisense or sense) were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase from the coding region of the LIG-1 cDNA clone (0.96-kb EcoRI-XhoI fragment, see Fig. 1A) subcloned into pBluescript SK(-) (Stratagene). Hybridization and posthybridization treatments were performed according to Simmons et al. (11Simmons D.M. Arriza J.L. Swanson L.W. J. Histotechnol. 1989; 12: 169-181Crossref Google Scholar) and Imaizumi et al. (12Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Tohyama M. Takagi T. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Photomicrographs were taken with bright- or dark-field illumination. For double staining of LIG-1 mRNA by in situ hybridization and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by immunohistochemistry, frozen sections of transcardially-perfused tissue fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution were reacted with anti-GFAP monoclonal antibody (Chemicon) followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, Inc.). The sections were photographed under fluorescence microscopy and subsequently subjected to in situ hybridization. A mouse brain cDNA library was screened with the initial cDNA fragment of 218 bp (reported as GA3-43 in Suzuki et al. (4Suzuki Y. Sato N. Tohyama M. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar)) as a probe, and several overlapping cDNA clones were obtained. Restriction mapping showed that all of these clones overlapped and therefore appeared to be derived from a single transcript (data not shown). The combined length of the overlapping cDNA clones was about 4.9 kb (Fig. 1A), which was consistent with the length of LIG-1 transcript detected by Northern blot analysis (5 kb, see Fig. 2). So, we considered that this likely represented the full-length cDNA. The complete nucleotide sequence of the LIG-1 cDNA (4840 bp) contains a long open reading frame of 3273 bp that starts at the first methionine codon within an appropriate Kozak's consensus sequence for the initiation of translation (13Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 12: 857-872Crossref Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). The predicted protein sequence derived from the open reading frame produces a 1091-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 120 kDa and 7 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (the sites are shown in Fig. 1B). The nucleotide and protein sequences have no significant similarity to any sequences deposited in the data bases, indicating that LIG-1 is indeed novel. To obtain insight into the function of LIG-1, we analyzed the deduced protein sequence (1091 amino acids) in detail. Its hydrophobic profile (14Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16477) Google Scholar) revealed that LIG-1 has features typical of integral membrane proteins; two hydrophobic segments were observed at the amino terminus (amino acids 1-33) and the central portion (amino acids 795-817) of the sequence, representing a putative signal peptide (15von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3665) Google Scholar) and a transmembrane region, respectively (Fig. 1B). Comparative protein data base analysis showed that it has two distinct well described structural/functional motifs associated with molecular recognition in the putative extracellular region, LRR and Ig-like domain (Fig. 1B). A tandem array of 15 LRR motifs of 23-27 residues, of which the consensus can be described as LX2LXLX2NXIX2LX4FX2L (where X denotes any amino acid), is located at amino acid positions 72-433 surrounded by an NH2-flanking lead sequence (amino acids 43-71) and a COOH-flanking trailer (amino acids 434-495) that are conserved among several LRR-containing proteins (16Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). A tandem array of 3 Ig-like domains is found at amino acids 496-794, which are directly adjacent to the COOH-flanking trailer and comprise almost the entire remaining part of the extracellular region. Each of the Ig-like domains contains approximately 100 amino acids and has two cysteine residues for a putative disulfide bond at the canonical positions, which is characteristic of the C2 subcategory (17Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Although, in this report, we omitted data concerning comparison between LIG-1 and other LRR-containing proteins, the canonical residues for the LRR and its flanking sequences were well conserved with some similarities between successive repeats. In the cytoplasmic region, however, no recognizable structural features that provide clues to the function of this protein such as kinase domains were detected, except that this region is overall hydrophilic. From the results of these structural analyses, it became apparent that LIG-1 is a novel integral membrane protein belonging to both the LRR and the Ig superfamilies. Proteins of these superfamilies have a diversity of functions, but their functions are mostly based on molecular recognition events. Therefore, the major role of LIG-1 could be related to molecular recognition similar to those of other members of the superfamilies. Analysis of the expression pattern of the LIG-1 gene is also an important approach for inference of its function. Here, we examined LIG-1 expression in differentiating P19 cells and mouse tissues by Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses. We performed Northern blot analysis on mRNA from undifferentiated, RA-treated and Me2SO-treated P19 cells. A probe was prepared from the 0.76-kb BglII-XhoI LIG-1 cDNA fragment (see Fig. 1A). The probe recognized a single transcript of approximately 5 kb, the expression of which was up-regulated specifically in RA-treated cells committed to neural differentiation but which was absent in undifferentiated and Me2SO-treated cells (Fig. 2A). This expression pattern indicates that LIG-1 may play some specific role(s) in the differentiation of neurons and/or glial cells. Expression of LIG-1 in various mouse organs was examined by Northern blot analysis. The level of LIG-1 mRNA expression was highest in the brain, and lower expression was detected in the thymus and heart. However, no expression was detected in the kidney, liver, lung, or small intestine (Fig. 2B). This tissue distribution of its gene expression indicates that LIG-1 may act mainly in the brain, suggesting a nervous system-related function. To localize the expression in the brain more precisely, we performed in situ hybridization analysis. Transverse sections of the adult mouse brain were hybridized with the LIG-1 antisense cRNA probe. This analysis revealed significant expression in a few limited areas such as the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum (Fig. 3, A and C) and the nerve fiber layer in the olfactory bulb (Fig. 3, B and D). Signals which were weaker but above background level were scattered in the cerebral cortex (data not shown). In the cerebellum, observation of sections at higher magnification suggested that the expression was in Bergmann glial cells rather than Purkinje neurons (Fig. 3C). In the olfactory bulb, the expression was likely to be in glial cells in the nerve fiber layer (Fig. 3D). To clarify whether these signals were in neurons or glial cells, the glial cells were visualized immunohistochemically using antibodies against GFAP (a glial marker). Double staining analysis indicated that the expression of LIG-1 was associated with a subset of GFAP-positive cells (compare Fig. 3, E with F). Therefore, we concluded that the expression observed in the olfactory bulb was in a subpopulation of glial cells. Subsequently, the developmental expression pattern of the LIG-1 gene was investigated on serial sections of mouse embryos at each gestational day between 12 and 18 days p.c. At 12 and 14 days p.c., midsagittal sections revealed expression in the ventricular layer of the CNS, olfactory bulb, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, chondroblasts and epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 3G). Expression in the ventricular layer of the CNS, olfactory bulb, and dorsal root ganglia was observed throughout the embryonic stage, while that in the spinal cord, chondroblasts and epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract began to fade at 16 days p.c. and was undetectable at 18 days p.c. (data not shown). Complete sequence analyses revealed LIG-1 to be a novel membrane glycoprotein (1091 amino acids) containing 15 LRRs and 3 Ig-like domains of the C2-type (Fig. 1B). LRR is a short sequence motif composed of 22-28 amino acids (the most common length is 24 residues), which has been implicated in highly specific protein-protein interactions such as cell adhesion or receptor-ligand binding (16Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 18Takahashi N. Takahashi Y. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1906-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The LRR motif has been found in a variety of proteins (the so-called LRR superfamily) with diverse functions such as yeast adenylate cyclase (19Kataoka T. Broek D. Wigler M.

Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Among these, the LRR motifs of Drosophila toll and slit gene products and the vertebrate Trk receptors are structurally organized similarly to that of LIG-1; their tandem LRRs are surrounded by both NH2- and COOH-flanking sequences. Although these flanking sequences are characteristic of the LRR superfamily and furthermore are thought to be a property of adhesive proteins and receptors, proteins with both of the flanking sequences account for only a small portion of such molecules. Interestingly, these known members with both the franking sequences commonly function in neural differentiation and/or development processes: (i) the toll gene product, which is a transmembrane receptor, is believed to transmit a signal that determines dorsal-ventral polarity during early embryogenesis (22Rothberg J.M. Jacobs J.R. Goodman C.S. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2169-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar); (ii) the slit gene product, although this is an extracellular protein with LRRs accompanied by EGF repeats, is thought to be necessary for the development of midline glia and commissural axon pathways (24Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and (iii) the Trk receptors, which are transmembrane proteins containing LRRs and a cytosolic tyrosine kinase domain, bind various neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or neurotrophin-3) selectively in their extracellular region and function in the transmembrane signaling of specific cell adhesion events involved in the development and/or maintenance of the nervous system (30Lamballe F. Klein R. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 66: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 32Klein R. Jing S. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Barbacid M.

Cell. 1991; 66: 395-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). The functional significance of the flanking sequences has not been fully elucidated. However, in the case of Toll receptor, three dominant mutations define the COOH-flanking trailer as a dominant factor that can control the activity of the Toll in signal transduction (34Schneider D.S. Hudson K.L. Lin T.Y. Anderson K.V. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Given these structure-function relationships as to LRR motifs, LIG-1 may also have a specialized function related to neural differentiation and/or development. The Ig-like domain is characterized by a common domain feature of approximately 100 amino acids, which forms a sandwich of two β-sheets that are typically stabilized by a disulfide bond (17Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Three different classes of Ig-like domains has been proposed: V, C1, and C2 (17Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). The C2 type Ig-like domain observed in LIG-1 has been found in several cell adhesive proteins including neural cell adhesion molecules such as Drosophila fasciclins (35Harrelson A.L. Goodman C.S.

Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1017-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some growth factor receptors such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like tyrosine kinase receptor family (41Yarden Y. Escobedo J.A. Kuang W.-J. Yand-Feng T.L. Daniel T.O. Tremble P.M. Chen E.Y. Ando M.E. Harkins R.N. Francke U. Fried V.A. Ullrich A. Williams L.T. Nature. 1986; 323: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and the Trk receptor family (42Schneider R. Schweiger M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1807-1811PubMed Google Scholar) have also been known to possess the C2 type Ig-like domains (for review, see Ref. 17Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). A common characteristic of these Ig-related molecules (the so-called Ig superfamily) is that most function in adhesion or recognition events via homophilic or heterophilic cell-cell interaction at the cell surface (17Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of Ig-like domains in LIG-1 suggests that it may function as a cell adhesion molecule. Although the LRR and Ig-like motifs are found in a variety of proteins, it should be stressed that the combination of both the motifs as found in LIG-1 is quite uncommon. To date, this type of combination has been reported in only two proteins; the vertebrate Trk receptors (42Schneider R. Schweiger M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1807-1811PubMed Google Scholar) and Drosophila peroxidasin, a protein which has a hybrid structure that combines an enzymatically functioning peroxidase domain with LRRs and Ig-like domains and is thought to participate in extracellular matrix consolidation, phagocytosis, and defense (43Nelson R.E. Fessler L.I. Takagi Y. Blumberg B. Keene D.R. Olson P.F. Parker C.G. Fessler J.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3438-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This raises the question of the functional significance of the domain organization. Recent studies have indicated that each of the LRR motif and Ig-like domain of the Trk receptors is an important structural element for their specific ligand-binding characteristics and transduction of the signal within the cell (44Perez P. Coll P.M. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zenca D. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 45Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Schelton D.L. Parada L.F. Presta L.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2795-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 46Windisch J.M. Marksteiner R. Lang M.E. Auer B. Schneider R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11256-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on the structural similarity of the domain organization to the Trk receptors (42Schneider R. Schweiger M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1807-1811PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that LIG-1 functions as a signal-transducing receptor. However, since LIG-1 has neither a kinase domain nor binding sites for src-like kinase, it is unlikely that LIG-1 functions as a receptor solely. The possibility that LIG-1 may interact with an as yet unidentified cytoplasmic molecule with kinase activity, and that it may participate in a signal transduction pathway, cannot be excluded. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that the LIG-1 gene was expressed predominantly in the mouse brain, restricted to a small subset of glial cells such as the Bergmann glial cells and those in the nerve fiber layer of the olfactory bulb (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). At present, the significance of the restricted pattern of LIG-1 expression is unknown. However, its expression pattern is quite distinct from those of any other genes which have been reported. In the cerebellum, Bergmann glia, specialized astrocytes, are thought to play an important role in guidance of postmitotic neuronal migration by cell-cell contact and in the adult brain may play an important modulatory role in the efficacy of synapses between parallel fibers and Purkinje cell spines, leading to changes in plasticity of the excitatory synapse (47Ortega A. Eshhar N. Teichberg V.I. Neuroscience. 1991; 41: 335-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 48Rakic P. J. Comp. Neurol. 1971; 141: 283-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 49Sotelo C. Alvarado-Mallart R.-M. Frain M. Vernet M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 124-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These interesting expression patterns suggest that LIG-1 may have a unique function related to neurogenesis mediated by cell migration and/or the maintenance of neural function such as synaptic plasticity. The simplest possibility is that LIG-1 could be a glial cell type-specific adhesion molecule. It should be noted that the expression of LIG-1 is restricted to a subset of glial cells at least in the adult brain while most neural cell adhesion molecules belonging to either LRR or Ig superfamilies are widely expressed in the nervous system. Cell adhesion molecules mediate various developmental phenomena in the nervous system such as neurite fasciculation, pathfinding of axons, stabilization of cell contact and cell migration. Among these, for example, Ng-CAM, a neural member of the Ig superfamily, has been implicated in both neuron-neuron and neuron-glia interactions, as well as the fasciculation of neurites and the migration of neurons along Bergmann glial cells during cerebellar development (50Grumet M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 51Grumet M. Edelman G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 487-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Ng-CAM is expressed on postmitotic neurons of the CNS and on neurons and Schwann cells of the peripheral nerve system, but not on glial cells (50Grumet M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that antibodies against Ng-CAM inhibit neuron-glia adhesion (50Grumet M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Ng-CAM binds homophilically to Ng-CAM on other neurons and heterophilically to as yet unidentified ligands on glial cells. LIG-1 might be such a glial ligand that interacts with Ng-CAM itself or with different Ng-CAM-like neuronal molecules which interact with glial cells. Taking the structural properties and expression patterns of LIG-1 into consideration, our conclusions can be summarized as follows: (i) LIG-1 is an integral membrane glycoprotein which is a new member of both the LRR and the Ig superfamilies, (ii) it may function as a cell type-specific adhesion molecule or some form of receptor, and (iii) it may play a role via homophilic and/or heterophilic interactions on the subset of glial cell surface in the nervous system in for example neuroglial differentiation, development, and/or maintenance of neural functions where it is expressed. Various questions remain regarding, for example, the functional significance of the combination of LRR and Ig-like motifs, the role of the cytoplasmic region with no known sequence characteristics, the significance of the restricted expression of LIG-1, whether LIG-1 interacts homophilically or heterophilically (with which other molecules), and if it functions as a receptor, the nature of its ligands and the mechanisms underlying these interactions. To answer these questions and better understand the role of LIG-1 in the nervous system, further biochemical analyses are required. Experiments to this end such as (i) cell adhesion assays, (ii) screening for ligands or specifically associated molecules, and (iii) preparation of antibodies against LIG-1 and analysis using them are currently in progress in our laboratory."

Several neurotransmitters, including somatostatin and dopamine, inhibit Na+-H+ exchange through a guanine-nucleotide-dependent mechanism, suggesting the involvement of a GTPase. In this study we determined that mutational activation of the α subunit of G12 inhibits the ubiquitously expressed Na+-H+ exchanger isoform, NHE1. Transient expression of mutationally activated Gα12 inhibited serum- and Gα13-stimulated NHE1 activity in HEK293 cells and CCL39 fibroblasts. In addition, in NHE-deficient AP1 cells stably expressing specific NHE isoforms, mutationally activated Gα12 inhibited NHE1 activity but stimulated activities of the Na+-H+ exchanger (NHE) isoforms NHE2 and NHE3. In contrast, mutationally activated Gα13, another member of the Gα12/13 family, stimulated all three NHE isoforms.

To characterize further the effects of the 18-kDa and HMW forms of FGF-2, we have examined their ability to modulate integrin expression. Transfected NIH 3T3 cells expressing only 18-kDa FGF-2 exhibited increased cell surface levels of α5β1, whereas cells expressing only HMW FGF-2 exhibited cell surface α5β1 levels similar to parental cells. When cells synthesizing 18-kDa FGF-2 were transfected with a cDNA encoding a dominant negative FGF receptor, α5β1 cell surface levels decreased. Immunoprecipitation of biosynthetically labeled cells indicated that expression of 18-kDa FGF-2 increased the biosynthesis and rate of maturation of α5. Northern blot analysis showed that 18-kDa FGF-2 increases the level of the α5 subunit mRNA but does not affect β1 subunit transcript levels. Experiments utilizing luciferase reporter gene activity revealed increased α5 promoter activity in cells expressing 18-kDa FGF-2 indicating that the enhanced α5 transcript level is due to modulation of the transcription rate. Therefore, interaction of 18-kDa FGF-2 with FGF receptors results in changes in α5β1 biosynthesis and processing. In contrast, endogenous expression of HMW FGF-2 does not mediate this effect.

We previously reported that exogenous FGF-2 modulates integrin expression in microvascualar endothelial cells (23Klein S. Giancotti F.G. Presta M. Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 973-982Google Scholar). Integrins are heterodimeric receptors composed of α and β subunits. At present, there are 8 different β and 15 different α subunits that can combine to form 21 receptors with distinct ligand specificities (24Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar). Integrins are involved in the processes of cell proliferation, motility, survival, and mesoderm induction (24Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar, 25Smith J.C. Symes K. Hynes R.O.

Endothelial cell integrins also function together with other families of adhesion molecules during vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, inflammation, and wound healing (30Luscinskas F.W. Lawler J. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 929-938Google Scholar, 31Bischoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 69-74Google Scholar). Treatment of endothelial cells with FGF-2 caused significant changes in the surface expression of nine different integrins (23Klein S. Giancotti F.G. Presta M. Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 973-982Google Scholar). Thus, modulation of integrins may be one of the FGF-2-induced effects on endothelial cells during angiogenesis. Several forms of FGF-2 are produced in vivo resulting from alternative initiation of translation either at an AUG codon or at three in-frame CUG codons 5′ to the AUG (32Prats H. Kaghad M. Prats A.C.

The relative amounts of the individual molecular weight forms have been reported to differ substantially among various cell lines and tissues during development, implying that the alternative codon usage is highly regulated (36Giordano S. Sherman L. Lyman W. Morrison R. Dev. Biol. 1992; 152: 293-303Google Scholar, 37Liu L. Doble B.W. Kardami E. Dev. Biol. 1993; 157: 507-516Google Scholar, 38Dono R. Zeller R. Dev.

It has been suggested that cis-acting elements in the FGF-2 mRNA are involved in regulating the translation of the different forms of FGF-2 at the four initiation sites (40Prats A.-C. Vagner S. Prats H. Amalric F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4796-4805Google Scholar). The process of alternative initiation of translation has varying consequences for the ultimate fate of the different FGF-2 forms (41Bugler B. Amalric F. Prats H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 573-577Google Scholar, 42Florkiewicz R.Z. Baird A. Gonzalez A.-M. Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 265-275Google Scholar, 43Quarto N. Finger F.P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell.

The three HMW forms of FGF-2 contain a nuclear localization sequence that concentrates the growth factor in that organelle. In contrast, 18-kDa FGF-2, which lacks a nuclear localization sequence, is primarily cytosolic. The existence of multiple forms of FGF-2 with different subcellular localizations raises the question of whether these different species of FGF-2 have specialized functions. We approached this question by creating stably transfected NIH 3T3 cell lines that express exclusively 18-kDa FGF-2, HMW FGF-2, or all forms of FGF-2 (45Quarto N. Talarico D. Florkiewicz R. Rifkin D.B. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 699-708Google Scholar, 46Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Google Scholar). Both 18-kDa FGF-2 and HMW FGF-2 alone expressed at high levels transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Cells expressing only 18-kDa FGF-2 had high motility and surface-associated 18-kDa FGF-2, whereas cells expressing exclusively HMW FGF-2 had low motility and virtually no surface-associated FGF-2. FGF receptors were down-regulated in cells expressing 18-kDa FGF-2 but not in cells expressing HMW FGF-2. Cells expressing HMW FGF-2 had a reduced serum requirement for growth, but cells expressing 18-kDa FGF-2 proliferated poorly in low serum. These results showed that 18-kDa and HMW FGF-2 have both unique and shared biological activities. Expression of a dominant negative FGF receptor in cells expressing 18-kDa FGF-2 inhibited their migration and suppressed their growth in soft agar as well as their saturation density. In contrast, expression of the dominant negative receptor in cells expressing HMW FGF-2 had no effect on their growth. Thus, 18-kDa and HMW FGF-2 may mediate certain functions through distinct mechanisms. 18-kDa FGF-2 modulates cell motility and proliferation through the interaction with its cell surface receptors, whereas HMW FGF-2 appears to act as a mitogen and an inducer of anchorage-independent growth through an intracellular mechanism. Our aim in the present study was to characterize additional functional differences between 18-kDa and HMW FGF-2. To this end, we chose to analyze the regulation of integrin expression by FGF-2 in NIH 3T3 cells expressing the various FGF-2 forms. We have determined which form of FGF-2 modulates integrin expression in these cells as well as the mechanism mediating this effect. We found that endogenous expression of 18-kDa FGF-2 modulates β1 integrin expression in NIH 3T3 cells, although endogenous expression of HMW FGF-2 does not. The induced expression of α5β1 on the cell surface mediated by endogenous expression of 18-kDa FGF-2 is a result of the combined effects of an increased level of transcript coding for the α5 subunit and an increased rate of processing of the α5 and β1 subunits. Recombinant human FGF-2 (18 kDa) was a gift from Synergen, Inc. (Boulder, CO) and Scios Nova (Mountain View, CA). Na125I and 35S-Trans-label were purchased from DuPont NEN, [α-32P]dCTP from DuPont Radiochemicals (Boston, MA), and 125I-protein A from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Irvine, CA). Lactoperoxidase, protein A-Sepharose, aprotinin, leupeptin, actinomycin D, and ATP were purchased from Sigma. Geneticin, Trizol, and lipofectamine were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Hygromycin B was from Calbiochem and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl-fluoride, hydrochloride from Boehringer Mannheim. Luciferin and cell lysis buffer for luciferase assays were purchased from Analytical Luminescence (San Diego, CA). The anti-integrin antibodies used in this study were raised by immunization of rabbits with synthetic peptides reproducing C-terminal portions of individual integrin subunits. The cytoplasmic peptide antibodies to α5 and β1 (47Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Google Scholar), α6 (48Giancotti F.G. Stepp M.A. Suzuki S. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J.

Cell. 1993; 4: 973-982Google Scholar) were previously described. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against human recombinant FGF-2 was used in Western blot analysis to detect levels of FGF-2 in the cell clones. NIH 3T3 cell clones transfected with Zip-neo vectors containing either a 1.1-kilobase insert of a cDNA encoding all FGF-2 forms (24, 22.5, 22, 18 kDa; clone WTFGFc3), a cDNA encoding only for the 24-22-kDa FGF-2 (clones 365FGFc2, 365FGFc9), or a cDNA encoding only for 18-kDa FGF-2 (clones 43FGFc21, 43FGFc31) were isolated as described (45Quarto N. Talarico D. Florkiewicz R. Rifkin D.B. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 699-708Google Scholar, 46Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Google Scholar). The cells were grown in DME (Bio-Whittaker) containing 10% FCS plus 500 µg/ml Geneticin. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the Zip-neo vector containing HMW FGF-2 cDNA were subsequently retransfected either with 18-kDa FGF-2 or with HMW FGF-2 cDNA inserts in the Zip-neo vector plus the pCEP4 vector containing a hygromycin resistance gene (kindly provided by Dr. C. Basilico, New York University Medical Center, New York) at a molar ratio of 8:1. Hygromycin-resistant clones were selected in DME containing 10% FCS, 200 µg/ml hygromycin B, and 250 µg/ml Geneticin. Secondary transfectants were characterized by Western blotting of cell extracts with anti-FGF-2 antibodies. The cells used were HMW clone transfected with 18-kDa FGF-2 cDNA, 365/43NC33; HMW clones transfected with HMW FGF-2 cDNA, 365/365FGFc14, 365/365FGFc38; control clone transfected with hygromycin-resistant gene alone, 365FGFHc3. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the Zip-neo vector containing either HMW, 18 kDa, or WT FGF-2 cDNAs were cotransfected with pRK5 containing a 1.3-kilobase insert of a human bek (FGF receptor 2) cDNA that lacks the C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain (dominant negative FGF receptor; kindly provided by Dr. J. Schlessinger, New York University Medical Center) and the pCEP4 vector. Hygromycin-resistant clones were selected in DME containing 10% FCS, 200 µg/ml hygromycin, and 250 µg/ml Geneticin. Resistant clones were tested for high affinity FGF-2 receptors according to Moscatelli (5Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Google Scholar) and by cross-linking to cell surface receptors with 125I-FGF-2. The cells used in this study were HMW FGF-2 clones transfected with dominant negative FGF receptor cDNA, 365DNc5, 365DNc7; 18-kDa FGF-2 clone transfected with dominant negative FGF receptor cDNA, 43DNc11; WT FGF-2 clone, WTDNc2. NIH 3T3 cells were plated at subconfluence in 15-cm dishes (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ). Cells were incubated for 48 h in fresh DME containing 5% FCS in the presence or absence of 15 ng/ml FGF-2. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and detached with 5 mM EDTA. The suspended cells were washed three times with PBS, and surface proteins were labeled with 158 µg/ml lactoperoxidase, 0.0038% H2O2, and Na125I (1 mCi/ml). Cells were washed three times with DME containing NaN3 and solubilized in 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100 containing leupeptin (10 µg/ml), aprotinin (50 µg/ml), and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl-fluoride, hydrochloride (1 mM). NIH 3T3 cells plated at subconfluence on 10- or 3.5-cm dishes were preincubated at 37°C for 1 h with Met/Cys-free minimum Eagle's medium and incubated at 37°C for 16 h in Met/Cys-free minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% FCS and 100 µCi/ml 35S-Trans-label. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were pulse-labeled with 500 µCi/ml 35S-Trans-label for 1 h. Cells were washed immediately with cold PBS or chased in DME plus 5% FCS. After cells were washed, they were extracted for 20 min with cold 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (RIPA buffer), containing protease inhibitors, removed from the dish with a Costar cell scraper, and sonicated. The 125I- and 35S-labeled cell lysates were immunoprecipitated as described previously (23Klein S. Giancotti F.G. Presta M. Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 973-982Google Scholar). Protein band intensity was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Northern blot analysis was performed with total cellular RNA isolated by single-step guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction using Trizol reagent. Mouse β1 and mouse α5 cDNA probes were kindly provided by Dr. H. S. Baldwin (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia), and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probe was kindly provided by Dr. A. M. Curatola (New York University Medical Center). Radioactive probes were made by using an oligonucleotide random priming procedure (Boehringer Mannheim) and [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol). The membranes were washed four times with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature and 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 min at 55°C. Blots were exposed to XAR-5 film and bands on the blots were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. To create the plasmid pα5-926LUC, the region of the human α5 gene from -926 to +23 bp was amplified using PCR with the template Pst-1A as described previously (50Birkenmeier T.M. McQuillan J.J. Boedeker E.D. Argraves W.S. Ruoslahti E. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20544-20549Google Scholar). The sequence -926 to -665 is available from GenBank/EMBL under accession number U48214. The sequence of the 5′ oligonucleotide corresponded to position -926 to -901 of the α5 gene containing a PstI restriction enzyme site on its 5′ end (underlined), d(AGCTCTGCAGGTTTACACCGATTAGGAGCTGAAGGT)-3′. The 3′ oligonucleotide corresponded to the reverse complement of the α5 sequence from +4 to +23 with a SalI restriction enzyme site on its 3′ end. The resulting PCR product was digested with SalI and PstI and cloned into the plasmid SK Bluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The insert was sequenced to ensure that no mutations occurred during PCR. To create the α5-luciferase expression vector, this plasmid was digested with the enzymes SmaI (contained immediately 5′ of the PstI site in the SK plasmid) and SalI, and the fragment was gel-purified and cloned into the SmaI and XhoI sites in the vector pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). NIH 3T3 cells were plated at subconfluence on 10-cm tissue culture dishes in DME containing FCS (10%). 18 h later, cells were transiently transfected using lipofectamine reagent with expression construct pα5-926LUC or with a control construct, pLUC, containing a promoterless luciferase gene and a β-galactosidase (β-gal) cotransfection control plasmid. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed once with PBS, scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 100 µl of 0.25 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. β-Gal activity was measured as described previously (51Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Results of β-gal activity were normalized according to protein concentration in each cell extract determined by the bicinchroninic acid method (Pierce). 35 µl of lysates were transferred to a Microlight 1 96-well plate (Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA). Luciferase activity was assayed using a ML3000 Microtiter Plate Luminometer (Dynatech Laboratories Inc.) that dispensed luciferin substrate buffer and quantitated emitted light from each well. Luciferin substrate buffer consisted of 20 mM Tricine, 1.07 mM (MgC03)4Mg(OH)2, 2.67 mM MgS04, 0.1 mM EDTA, 33.3 mM dithiothreitol, 800 µM luciferin, and 750 µM ATP. Luciferase activity was recorded as relative light units. Luciferase activity was normalized by dividing by β-gal activity (A420). The stability of α5 mRNA was determined by adding the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (5 µg/ml) to NIH 3T3 cells. Total RNA was isolated after various times of incubation with the inhibitor and subjected to Northern blot hybridization as described above. Previously we demonstrated that integrin expression in cultured endothelial cells could be modulated by exogenous FGF-2 (23Klein S. Giancotti F.G. Presta M. Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 973-982Google Scholar). In order to explore the effects of endogenous FGF-2 expression on integrins, we chose to examine integrin levels in NIH 3T3 cells as these cells expressing different forms of FGF-2 are a useful model to study FGF-2 activity (45Quarto N. Talarico D. Florkiewicz R. Rifkin D.B. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 699-708Google Scholar, 46Bikfalvi A. Klein S. Pintucci G. Quarto N. Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 233-243Google Scholar). To establish that FGF-2 was capable of modulating integrin levels in 3T3 cells, control cells were treated for 48 h with and without FGF-2 (15 ng/ml), cell surface proteins were iodinated, and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-integrin antibodies. In agreement with previous observations demonstrating the induction of β1 integrins in capillary endothelial cells, addition of FGF-2 increased β1 integrin cell surface levels as visualized using anti-β1 antibodies. Specifically, immunoprecipitation with anti-α5 and anti-α6 antibodies indicated that the two most abundant integrins, α5β1 and α6β1, increased by 3.2- and 3.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 1A and Table I). Thus, exogenous FGF-2 stimulates integrin expression in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts as well as in capillary endothelial cells.TABLE IEffect of exogenous FGF-2 treatment on cell surface integrins in control cells or in NIH 3T3 cells synthesizing different FGF-2 formsCellsα5β1α6β1fold increaseControl3.23.5HMW FGF-24.12.118-kDa FGF-21.71.8WT FGF-21.01.0 Open table in a new tab To test whether endogenous FGF-2 synthesis also affects integrin expression, we examined the cell surface integrins in NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with the FGF-2 cDNA encoding all forms of FGF-2 (wild type (WT) FGF-2). Immunoprecipitation of surface-labeled cells with anti-β1 antibody indicated that overall cell surface β1 integrins were increased by 3.1-fold compared with control cells (Fig. 1A). Specifically, immunoprecipitation with anti-α5 and anti-α6 antibodies revealed that the α5β1 and α6β1 integrins were enhanced by 3.1- and 2.3-fold, respectively. In addition, we checked whether the levels of other β1 integrins were also modulated by endogenous FGF-2. The results obtained by immunoprecipitation of cells synthesizing WT FGF-2 using anti-α3 and anti-αv antibodies indicated that α3β1 levels were decreased 2-fold, and αvβ1 levels were not changed compared with control cells (Fig. 1B). Other β1 integrins were not detected in these cells by our analysis. Our results thus show that endogenous FGF-2 differentially modulates cell surface levels of specific β1 integrins in NIH 3T3 cells. To determine which form(s) of FGF-2 expressed by the WT FGF-2 transfected cells modulate(s) integrin levels, we examined the cell surface integrin content in NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with cDNAs encoding different species of FGF-2. By Western blot analysis, we have demonstrated that comparable, steady-state levels of FGF-2 are produced in the cell clones transfected with either 18-kDa FGF-2 or HMW FGF-2 cDNA (data not shown). A pulse-chase experiment with metabolically labeled WT FGF-2 transfected cells has shown that the rates of synthesis and degradation of the different FGF-2 forms are also similar. 2Pintucci, G., Quarto, N., and Rifkin, D. B. (1996) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press. Therefore, any differences in biological responses of 18-kDa and HMW FGF-2 cannot be due to differences in levels or rates of synthesis or degradation of FGF-2 forms among the various cell clones used in this study. To simplify the analysis of integrins regulated by FGF-2, we focused on α5β1 levels. Fig. 2A illustrates that NIH 3T3 cells synthesizing 18-kDa FGF-2 alone have 2-3-fold increased cell surface β1 integrin levels. Specifically, immunoprecipitation of cells with antibodies against the α5 and β1 subunits revealed that the amount of α5β1 integrin was increased compared with control levels. In contrast to the results obtained with cells synthesizing 18-kDa FGF-2, immunoprecipitation of cell extracts from NIH 3T3 cells expressing only HMW FGF-2 with antibodies to β1 and α5 subunits indicated that no change occurs in the level of β1 integrins. Thus, endogenous 18-kDa FGF-2 increases the β1 surface integrins on NIH 3T3 cells, but HMW FGF-2 does not. Similar results were obtained with three additional clones of each cell type synthesizing comparable levels of FGF-2 as determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown). We investigated whether exogenously added FGF-2 increases integrin levels in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with HMW FGF-2 cDNA. As in control cells, addition of FGF-2 increased cell surface levels of β1 integrins including the α5β1 and α6β1 receptors in cells expressing only HMW FGF-2 (Table I). Thus, the low level of integrins in NIH 3T3 cells synthesizing only HMW FGF-2 does not result from an inability to respond to extracellular FGF-2. In contrast to control cells and cells expressing HMW FGF-2, FGF-2 addition to cells synthesizing WT FGF-2 did not further increase integrin levels. In cells synthesizing 18-kDa FGF-2, integrin levels were further induced only slightly by exogenous addition of FGF-2 (Table I). The previous results support the hypothesis that endogenous HMW FGF-2 does not increase β1 integrins above levels observed in control cells, although exogenous FGF-2 can mediate this effect on these cells. To test further whether the synthesis of 18-kDa FGF-2 is responsible for changes in integrin levels, cells synthesizing only HMW FGF-2 were transfected with cDNAs encoding 18-kDa FGF-2 and a hygromycin-resistant gene. As shown in Fig. 2B, cells expressing both HMW FGF-2 and 18-kDa FGF-2 displayed a 3-fold increase in β1 integrins compared with cells expressing HMW FGF-2 alone. This result confirms the hypothesis"
https://openalex.org/W1975418104,"Recently, natural variants of TEM-1 β-lactamase with amino acid substitutions at residues 237-240 have been identified that have increased hydrolytic activity for extended-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftazidime. To identify the sequence requirements in this region for a given antibiotic, a random library was constructed that contained all possible amino acid combinations for the 3-residue region 237-240 (ABL numbering system) of TEM-1 β-lactamase. An antibiotic disc diffusion method was used to select mutants with wild-type level activity or greater for the extended-spectrum cephalosporin ceftazidime and the monobactam aztreonam. Mutants that were selected for optimal ceftazidime hydrolysis contained a conserved Ala at position 237, a Ser for Gly substitution at position 238, and a Lys for Glu at position 240. Mutants selected for aztreonam hydrolysis exhibited a Gly for Ala substitution at position 237, a Ser for Gly substitution at position 238, and a Lys/Arg for Glu at position 240. The role of the A237G substitution in differentiating between ceftazidime and aztreonam was further investigated by kinetic analysis of the A237G, E240K, G238S:E240K, and A237G:G238S:E240K enzymes. The A237G single mutant and the G238S:E240K double mutant exhibited increases in catalytic efficiency for both ceftazidime and aztreonam. However, the triple mutant A237G:G238S:E240K, displayed a 12-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency for ceftazidime but a 3-fold increase for aztreonam relative to the G238S:E240K double mutant. Thus, the A237G substitution increases ceftazidime hydrolysis when present alone but antagonizes ceftazidime hydrolysis when it is combined with the G238S:E240K substitutions. In contrast, the A237G substitution acts additively with the G238S:E240K substitutions to increase aztreonam hydrolysis.

Here we demonstrate that peptide-based inhibitors of the interleukin 1β-converting enzyme family of cysteine proteases (Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone) and of the nuclear scaffold multicatalytic proteinase (Ala-Pro-Phe chloromethyl ketone) block the degradation of lamin B1 to a 21-kDa fragment in thymocytes treated with glucocorticoid, the Ca2+-mobilizing agent thapsigargin, or antibodies to the T cell receptor.

This approach allows simultaneous assessment of hundreds of humanized variable regions to identify the molecules that best preserve affinity, thus overcoming the major drawback of current humanization procedures, the requirement to construct and analyze each humanized antibody separately. Murine residues of BR96 were mutated to human if they were solvent-exposed residues that did not participate in the formation of the antigen binding site and were not at the interface of the light and heavy chain. At positions that might be involved in binding to antigen, the choice between the murine and human residue was more difficult. Murine and human alternatives were incorporated into a combinatorial library at positions representing buried residues that might affect the structural integrity of the antigen binding site.

Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M. Spinelli S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Google Scholar, 14Kettleborough C.A. Saldanha J. Heath V.J. Morrison C.J. Bendig M.M. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 773-783Google Scholar), and influence packing interactions between the β-sheet strands (15Chothia C. Novotny J. Bruccoleri R. Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 651-663Google Scholar). Molecular modeling and crystal data, when available, have helped to identify murine framework residues that most likely contribute to the integrity of the binding site. Preservation of these residues in humanized antibodies often maintains affinity for antigen comparable to the original antibody (9Riechmann L. Clark M. Waldmann H. Winter G. Nature. 1988; 332: 323-327Google Scholar, 11Foote J. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 487-499Google Scholar, 14Kettleborough C.A. Saldanha J. Heath V.J. Morrison C.J. Bendig M.M.

Detailed structural information is not available for many antibodies, which prompted development of other approaches for designing humanized V regions that maintain acceptable affinity. Such methods include computer assisted design (17Queen C. Schneider W.P. Selick H.E. Payne P.W. Landolfi N.F. Duncan J.F. Avdalovic N.M. Levitt M. Junghans R.P. Waldmann T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10029-10033Google Scholar, 18Hsiao K.-C. Bajorath J. Harris L.J. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 815-822Google Scholar), variable domain resurfacing (19Roguska M.A. Pedersen J.T. Keddy C.A. Henry A.H. Searle S.J. Lambert J.M. Goldmacher V.S. Blattler W.A. Rees A.R. Guild B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 969-973Google Scholar), framework exchange (20Benhar I. Padlan E.A. Jung S.-H. Lee B. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12051-12055Google Scholar), a positional consensus method (21Couto J.R. Blank E. Peterson J.A. Ceriani R.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1717-1722Google Scholar), and sequence homology comparisons (22Singer I.I. Kawka D.W. DeMartino J.A. Daugherty B.L. Elliston K.O. Alves K. Bush B.L. Cameron P.M. Cuca G.C. Davies P. Forrest M.J. Kazazis D.M. Law M.-F. Lenny A.B. MacIntyre D.E. Meurer R. Padlan E.A. Pandya S. Schmidt J.A. Seamans T.C. Scott S. Silberklang M. Williamson A.R. Mark G.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2844-2857Google Scholar). These humanization methods generally require an iterative approach to create, characterize, and correct, if necessary, the sequence of a humanized V region. Even as our understanding of antibody structure increases and more information is available regarding positions that predominantly affect ligand binding, it remains difficult to generalize the approach. Designing a humanized antibody requires making choices of which residues to change and which to retain. Making these decisions is often subjective, but creating a set of humanized molecules that represents all of the alternatives at positions where the choice is difficult reduces the degree of subjectivity. Simultaneously determining the binding activity of the many different humanized forms contained in such a set or “library” reduces or eliminates the need to rely on a trial and error strategy. We have humanized the anticarcinoma mAb BR96 by a combinatorial library design strategy that created a set of humanized V regions from which sequences that best preserved affinity were rapidly selected. BR96 recognizes a tumor-associated antigen expressing a Lewis Y (Ley) related carbohydrate on the surface of many human carcinomas (23Hellstrüm I. Garrigues H.J. Garrigues U. Hellstrüm K.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2183-2190Google Scholar, 24Hakomori S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 257-331Google Scholar). An immunoconjugate of chimeric BR96 with doxorubicin induces complete regressions and cures of human tumor xenografts growing in athymic mice (25Trail P.A. Willner D. Lasch S.J. Henderson A.J. Hofstead A.J. Casazza A.M. Firestone R.A. Hellstrüm I. Hellstrüm K.E. Science. 1993; 261: 212-215Google Scholar). The chimeric BR96 immunoconjugate is currently in human clinical trials. We have constructed an M13 phage Fab expression library containing combinations of human and murine residues at several positions among those selected for humanization of BR96. In this report we discuss the design of a humanized BR96 library and the selection and characterization of several humanized BR96 Fabs from it. In addition, we compare our humanization procedure and results with those of Benhar et al. (20Benhar I. Padlan E.A. Jung S.-H. Lee B. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12051-12055Google Scholar), who humanized B3, another anti-Ley mAb (26Pastan I. Lovelace E.T. Gallo M.G. Rutherford A.V. Magnani J.L. Willingham M.C. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3781-3787Google Scholar) that has a highly homologous sequence to BR96 (27Brinkmann U. Reiter Y. Jung S.-H. Lee B. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7538-7542Google Scholar). Human immunoglobulin sequences were identified from several protein data bases, GenBank™, EMBL, SwissProt, and PIR, by the Stringsearch program of the GCG Package (Sequence Analysis Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). To compare the human sequences to BR96 V regions we used the FastA program (28Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Google Scholar) adapted for the GCG package. We selected the human germline light and heavy chain sequences with the highest degree of homology with the BR96 framework regions 1, 2, and 3 of each chain by evaluating variable domain sequence profiles as described previously (29Harris L. Bajorath J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 306-310Google Scholar). BR96 variable domain heavy and light chain gene sequences and the corresponding selected human sequences were aligned, and CDR loop assignments were made according to the canonical structure model described by Chothia and Lesk (30Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Google Scholar). The structure-based CDR loop assignments of Chothia and Lesk (30Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Google Scholar) spatially delineate the binding site better than the sequence-defined hypervariable regions of Kabat et al. (31Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Reid-Miller M. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH, Bethesda, MD1987Google Scholar). Sequence numbering and framework region alignments were according to Kabat et al. (31Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Reid-Miller M. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH, Bethesda, MD1987Google Scholar). Differences in residues between BR96 and selected human germline templates were mapped on a three-dimensional model of the BR96 variable regions (32Bajorath J. Bioconjugate Chem. 1994; 5: 213-219Google Scholar). From the model we identified residues important (13Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A. Levitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M. Spinelli S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Google Scholar) or potentially important to the interface of the heavy chain and light chain V regions or to the integrity of the antigen binding site. The selected human framework sequences were then inspected for conservation of buried (“packing”) residues as defined by Padlan (33Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 489-498Google Scholar). Considering the modeling information and identification of buried residues, we made decisions to retain a murine residue, change it to the human counterpart, or include both the human and murine alternatives in the combinatorial library. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified as described elsewhere (34Yelton D.E. Rosok M.J. Cruz G. Cosand W.L. Bajorath J. Hellstrüm I. Hellstrüm K.E. Huse W.D. Glaser S.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1994-2004Google Scholar). Synthesis of oligonucleotides incorporated a 1:1 mixture of murine codons to human codons at the selected library positions (35Glaser S. Kristensson K. Chilton T. Huse W. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Antibody Engineering:. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide mixtures were double-deprotected with concentrated NH4OH, purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and eluted from the excised gel slices (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The molecule chosen for humanization was a mutant of chimeric BR96, M1, that contains an Asp to Ala mutation at heavy chain position 97 resulting in an increased affinity for tumor antigen (34Yelton D.E. Rosok M.J. Cruz G. Cosand W.L. Bajorath J. Hellstrüm I. Hellstrüm K.E. Huse W.D. Glaser S.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1994-2004Google Scholar). We generated de novo full-length humanized V region genes from long overlapping oligonucleotides for insertion into an M13 Fab expression vector by hybridization mutagenesis (35Glaser S. Kristensson K. Chilton T. Huse W. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Antibody Engineering:. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar, 37Near R.I. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 88-97Google Scholar). We included codons for the murine and human alternatives at library positions in the synthesis of the humanized V region oligonucleotides, rather than create the combinatorial library after the V regions were incorporated into the phage vector (34Yelton D.E. Rosok M.J. Cruz G. Cosand W.L. Bajorath J. Hellstrüm I. Hellstrüm K.E. Huse W.D. Glaser S.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1994-2004Google Scholar). The full-length humanized V region single-stranded DNAs required for hybridization mutagenesis were synthesized in a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Annealing PCR primers had at least 18 nucleotide residues complementary to vector sequences for efficient annealing of the single-stranded V region products to the vector. Equimolar concentrations of the annealing PCR primers and of six (light chain) or seven (heavy chain) overlapping 60-80 nucleotide sequences were amplified to generate double-stranded DNA. From the double-stranded products single-stranded DNA was prepared by asymmetric PCR. The oligonucleotides for the light and heavy chains with the sites of library positions underlined are as follows. Light chain oligonucleotides were forward primer (5′), 5′-GCCCAACCAGCCATGGCCGATGTTGTCATGACCCAA-3′; reverse primer, (3′), 5′-GATGAAGACAGATGGTGCAGCCACAGTACGTTTGAT-3′.

Heavy chain oligonucleotides were forward primer (5′), 5′-ACCCCTGTGGCAAAAGCCGAAGTGCAACTGGTGGAG-3′; reverse primer (3′), 5′-TGGGCCCTTGGTGGAGGCGGAAGAGACCGTGACCAG-3′; oligonucleotide 1 (forward): 5′-GAAGTGCAACTGGTGGAGTCTGGGGGAGGCTTAGTGCAGCCTGGAGGGTCCCTGCGACTTTCCTGT-3′; 2 (reverse), 5′-CTGGCGAACCCAATACATGTAATAGTCACTGAAAGTGAATCCAGATG(T/C)AGCACAGGAAAGTCGCAG-3′; 3 (forward), 5′-TATTGGGTTCGCCAGGCTGGAGGCAAGGGACTGGAGTGGGTC(G/T)CATACATTAGTCAAGGTGGTGAT-3′; 4 (reverse), 5′-GTCTCTGGAGATGGTGAATCGACCCTTTACGGAGTCTGCATAGTCGGTTATATCACCACCTTGACT-3′; 5 (forward), 5′-ACCATCTCCAGAGACAATGCAAAGAACAGCCTGTACCTGCAAATGAACAGCCTGAGGGACGAGGAC-3′; 6 (reverse), 5′-AGCAAACCAGGCCCCGTCCGCCAGGCCTGTTGCACAGTAATACACGGCTGTGTCCTCGTCCCTCAG-3′; 7 (forward), 5′-GGGGCCTGGTTTGCTTACTGGGGCCAAGGGACTCTGGTCACGGTCTCTTCC-3′. The PCR reaction (50 µl) for each chain contained 50 pmol each of oligonucleotides 1-6 (light chain) or oligonucleotides 1-7 (heavy chain), and the respective forward (5′) and reverse (3′) annealing PCR primers, 67 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 1.66 mM NH4SO4, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM dNTPs and 0.25 unit Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). Conditions for PCR amplification were denaturation for 30 s at 94°C, annealing for 30 s at 50°C, and synthesis at 72°C for 30 s for 2 cycles, followed by 30 cycles of denaturing for 30 s at 94°C, annealing for 30 s at 55°C, and synthesis for 30 s at 72°C and extension for 5 min at 72°C. A 2-µl portion (approximately 0.8 µg) of the double-stranded DNA products was subsequently amplified by asymmetric PCR (100 µl) (35Glaser S. Kristensson K. Chilton T. Huse W. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Antibody Engineering:. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar, 38Tessier D.C. Thomas D.Y. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 498-501Google Scholar) adding only the reverse annealing PCR primer (0.1 nmol) in the same buffer described above without β-mercaptoethanol. The reaction was denatured at 95°C for 1 min followed by 20 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 20 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and synthesis at 72°C for 30 s, followed by extension for 7 min at 72°C. The single-stranded products were isolated in a 2% low melting temperature agarose gel prepared with Tris acetate EDTA buffer and then extracted from the gel with the Geneclean kit according to the manufacturer (San Diego, CA). 150 ng of the light chain and heavy chain single-stranded PCR products were phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase and simultaneously annealed to 250 ng of uridinylated M13IX104 vector (37Near R.I. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 88-97Google Scholar, 39Kristensson K. Glaser S.M. Zebedee S.L. Huse W.D. Casadevall A. Scharff M.D. Vaccines 95. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 39Google Scholar). M13IX104 encodes CH1 of human IgG1 and human κ light chain constant domain. The reaction mixture was extended and ligated as described (40Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-383Google Scholar) and diluted with water to a final volume of 20 µl. Escherichia coli strain XL-1 was transfected by electroporation with 1 µl of the mutagenesis reaction and incubated at 37°C until plaques had formed. Plaque lift assays were performed as described using 2 µg/ml synthetic Ley tetrasaccharide hydrazide (sLey) (Alberta Research Council (ARC), Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (sLey-HRP) as a probe (34Yelton D.E. Rosok M.J. Cruz G. Cosand W.L. Bajorath J. Hellstrüm I. Hellstrüm K.E. Huse W.D. Glaser S.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1994-2004Google Scholar). Phage clones reactive with sLey were used to infect cultures of E. coli strain MK30-3 (Boehringer Mannheim) for the production of soluble Fab fragments. To characterize each humanized Fab we prepared periplasmic fractions, performed quantitative and antigen binding ELISAs with paraformaldehyde fixed tumor cells or tumor cell membranes, and conducted surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments as described previously (34Yelton D.E. Rosok M.J. Cruz G. Cosand W.L. Bajorath J. Hellstrüm I. Hellstrüm K.E. Huse W.D. Glaser S.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1994-2004Google Scholar). As a control for ELISA and SPR experiments, BR96 Fab was prepared by proteolytic digestion of chimeric BR96 with papain using the ImmunoPure® Fab Preparation Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single-stranded DNA from humanized BR96 clones was isolated, and the heavy and light chain V region genes were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide termination method (Sequenase Version 2, U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Site-directed mutagenesis to correct PCR errors or to introduce additional specific single codon changes was performed essentially as described by Kunkel et al. (40Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-383Google Scholar). The template for site-directed experiments was uridinylated single-stranded DNA from humanized Fab clone (2-40) with two affinity mutations. This affinity mutant, designated M3, had mutations in CDR2 (Gly53→ Asp53) and CDR3 (Asp97→ Ala97) of the heavy chain, which improved the binding affinity of chimeric BR96 for tumor antigen (34Yelton D.E. Rosok M.J. Cruz G. Cosand W.L. Bajorath J. Hellstrüm I. Hellstrüm K.E. Huse W.D. Glaser S.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1994-2004Google Scholar). Two site-specific mutants of humanized BR96 M3 were prepared by introducing mutations at position 19 or 82b in the heavy chain. The oligonucleotide sequences to mutate Arg to Lys at position 19 and Ser to Arg at position 82b in the heavy chain of humanized BR96 M3 were 5′-GATGCAGCACAGGATAACTTCAGGGACCCTCCAG-3′ and 5′-CGTCCCTCAGTCGGTTCATTTG-3′, respectively. To design the humanized BR96 framework V region we selected a set of human germline sequences from a homology search of available immunoglobulin V region sequences. Because framework residues can influence the conformation of the antigen binding site, we chose human frameworks closely resembling that of murine BR96 (mBR96) to maximize the probability they would provide similar structural support of the CDR loops. We preferred germline sequences for templates rather than same or higher scoring non-germline sequences, because of the unknown contribution of somatic mutations to immunogenicity. Since most light and heavy chain combinations assemble correctly, we chose the most homologous templates for each chain independently. The chosen human heavy chain V region, locus HSIGDP51 (accession no. Z12351), subgroup III, had 80% homology of frameworks 1, 2, and 3 to the BR96 heavy chain sequence (Fig. 1). The selection for the light chain template was germline V region HSIGVA23 (accession no. X12684), subgroup II, with 79% homology to the BR96 light chain frameworks 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 1). The most homologous J region segments were JH4 for the heavy chain and Jk2 for the light chain. The antibody humanized in these studies was BR96 M1, a mutant of BR96 with improved affinity resulting from one amino acid substitution in CDR3 of the heavy chain (34Yelton D.E. Rosok M.J. Cruz G. Cosand W.L. Bajorath J. Hellstrüm I. Hellstrüm K.E. Huse W.D. Glaser S.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1994-2004Google Scholar). The heavy and light chain amino acid sequences of BR96 M1 and human template sequences were aligned and differences between the murine and human frameworks identified. We inspected a BR96 model (32Bajorath J. Bioconjugate Chem. 1994; 5: 213-219Google Scholar) to map the predicted spatial position of each residue, and then decided whether to retain the murine residue, to substitute the human residue, or to include both the murine and human residues in the combinatorial library. We maintained the murine residues at structural determinant positions (marked with # in Fig. 1) that are responsible for the canonical loop conformations of an antibody (13Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A. Levitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M. Spinelli S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Google Scholar). The only structural determinant position in the framework with a different residue in BR96 and the human template was position 2 in the light chain (Fig. 1), and we retained the murine residue valine. Examination of the model indicated that none of the solvent exposed residues different between BR96 M1 and the human template were likely to be important for maintaining the structure of the antigen binding site. We chose to mutate all solvent exposed residues, 11 residues in the light chain and 16 in the heavy chain, to the human amino acids (Fig. 1). The residues considered for library positions were buried amino acids as defined by Padlan (33Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 489-498Google Scholar). Humanization of the anti-lysozyme antibody, D1.3 (11Foote J. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 487-499Google Scholar) and of an anti-CD18 mAb, m1B4 (22Singer I.I. Kawka D.W. DeMartino J.A. Daugherty B.L. Elliston K.O. Alves K. Bush B.L. Cameron P.M. Cuca G.C. Davies P. Forrest M.J. Kazazis D.M. Law M.-F. Lenny A.B. MacIntyre D.E. Meurer R. Padlan E.A. Pandya S. Schmidt J.A. Seamans T.C. Scott S. Silberklang M. Williamson A.R. Mark G.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2844-2857Google Scholar) demonstrated the critical nature of some buried residues. CDR grafting of D1.3 caused a 45-fold decrease in its binding affinity. Changing four buried framework residues back to the murine residues restored binding activity to within 4-fold of the murine antibody. For humanized 1B4, recovery of a 3-fold loss of activity measured in an in vitro adhesion assay occurred by changing three buried residues back to the murine residues (22Singer I.I. Kawka D.W. DeMartino J.A. Daugherty B.L. Elliston K.O. Alves K. Bush B.L. Cameron P.M. Cuca G.C. Davies P. Forrest M.J. Kazazis D.M. Law M.-F. Lenny A.B. MacIntyre D.E. Meurer R. Padlan E.A. Pandya S. Schmidt J.A. Seamans T.C. Scott S. Silberklang M. Williamson A.R. Mark G.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2844-2857Google Scholar). The BR96 library included buried residues at heavy chain and light chain positions where the murine and human choices were between nonconservative residues. In the heavy chain of BR96 four buried positions differed between the murine (m) and human (h) template sequences, position 20 (m = Val, h = Leu), 24 (m = Thr, h = Ala), 49 (m = Ala, h = Ser), and 77 (m = Thr, h = Ser). We included positions 24 and 49 (Table I) in the library, since they are less conservative choices. The amino acid choices at positions 20 and 77 were conservative and we chose to humanize both. In addition, at position 20, the murine residue Val rarely occurs in human VHIII sequences (less than 5%) (31Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Reid-Miller M. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH, Bethesda, MD1987Google Scholar). The fourth potential library position, 77, is not proximal to a CDR loop and the computer model suggested that neither the Thr (murine) nor Ser (human) would affect CDR conformation.TABLE IConstruction of combinatorial humanized BR96 M1 Fab libraryMouseHumanHeavy chain positions24ThrAla49AlaSerLight chain positions11LeuSer36TyrLeu37LeuGln43SerPro104LeuVal/Leu Open table in a new tab Inspection of buried residues in the light chain V regions revealed different residues at six positions, position 2 (m = Thr, h = Ser), 11 (m = Leu, h = Ser), 36 (m = Tyr, h = Leu), 37 (m = Leu, h = Gln), 43 (m = Ser, h = Pro), and 104 (m = Leu, h = Val). As noted above we maintained the murine residue at position 2 of BR96 because this position is a canonical structural determinant for the L1 loop (13Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A. Levitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M. Spinelli S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Google Scholar). Even though the two amino acid choices are conservative at position 104, we included this position in the combinatorial library since representation of Leu and Val in the human Jk2 segment is approximately equivalent in human J region sequences homologous to BR96. Therefore, the humanized antibody library incorporated the murine and human alternative amino acids at light chain positions 11, 36, 37, 43, an"
https://openalex.org/W2043033098,"During endochondral bone formation, cartilage cells show increased matrix synthesis and rapid proliferation. We found that cartilage matrix contains at least two types of heparin binding growth-promoting components. One, with a higher affinity to heparin, was identified as chondromodulin I (Hiraki, Y., Tanaka, H., Inoue, H., Kondo, J., Kamizono, A., and Suzuki, F. (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 175, 871-977). In this study, we isolated a novel growth-promoting component, chondromodulin II, which has a lower heparin affinity, from the dissociative extracts of fetal bovine epiphyseal cartilage. Chondromodulin II stimulated the proteoglycan synthesis in rabbit cultured growth plate chondrocytes, an expression of the differentiated phenotype of chondrocytes. It also stimulated DNA synthesis in chondrocytes in both the absence and the presence of fibroblast growth factor-2. The apparent molecular mass of chondromodulin II on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 16 kDa. Its complete amino acid sequence was determined by overlapping sequences of the peptides released by endopeptidase digestion and CNBr cleavage. Chondromodulin II consists of 133 amino acids (calculated Mr = 14,548). The sequence was unique but homologous to the repeats 1 and 2 of the deduced amino acid sequence of the chicken mim-1 gene, which is specifically transactivated by the v-Myb oncogene product in promyelocytes. We also found a minor component with a higher heparin affinity, chondromodulin III, in cartilage extracts. Chondromodulin III stimulated DNA synthesis in chondrocytes in vitro, and its N-terminal sequence was identical with ribosomal protein L31 lacking the N-terminal three amino acids. These findings suggest that the growth and differentiation of chondrocytes are regulated by multiple components in the cartilage matrix. During endochondral bone formation, cartilage cells show increased matrix synthesis and rapid proliferation. We found that cartilage matrix contains at least two types of heparin binding growth-promoting components. One, with a higher affinity to heparin, was identified as chondromodulin I (Hiraki, Y., Tanaka, H., Inoue, H., Kondo, J., Kamizono, A., and Suzuki, F. (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 175, 871-977). In this study, we isolated a novel growth-promoting component, chondromodulin II, which has a lower heparin affinity, from the dissociative extracts of fetal bovine epiphyseal cartilage. Chondromodulin II stimulated the proteoglycan synthesis in rabbit cultured growth plate chondrocytes, an expression of the differentiated phenotype of chondrocytes. It also stimulated DNA synthesis in chondrocytes in both the absence and the presence of fibroblast growth factor-2. The apparent molecular mass of chondromodulin II on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 16 kDa. Its complete amino acid sequence was determined by overlapping sequences of the peptides released by endopeptidase digestion and CNBr cleavage. Chondromodulin II consists of 133 amino acids (calculated Mr = 14,548). The sequence was unique but homologous to the repeats 1 and 2 of the deduced amino acid sequence of the chicken mim-1 gene, which is specifically transactivated by the v-Myb oncogene product in promyelocytes. We also found a minor component with a higher heparin affinity, chondromodulin III, in cartilage extracts. Chondromodulin III stimulated DNA synthesis in chondrocytes in vitro, and its N-terminal sequence was identical with ribosomal protein L31 lacking the N-terminal three amino acids. These findings suggest that the growth and differentiation of chondrocytes are regulated by multiple components in the cartilage matrix. INTRODUCTIONThe growth of cartilage plays a key role in endochondral bone formation during embryonic development and during the longitudinal growth of bone.

Cartilage is a major source of FGF (1Sullivan R. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2399-2403Google Scholar), although growth factors of the FGF family are also widely distributed in the body (2Gonzalez A.-M. Buscaglia M. Ong M. Baird A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 753-765Google Scholar). Recent DNA analysis has revealed point mutations in the FGF receptor 3 gene in achondroplasia (3Shiang R. Thompson L.M. Zhu Y.-Z. Church D.M. Fielder T.J. Bocian M. Winokur S.T. Wasmuth J.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 335-342Google Scholar, 4Rousseau F. Bonaventure J. Legeai-Mallet L. Pelet A. Rozet J.-M. Maroteaux P. Le Merrer M. Munnich A. Nature. 1994; 371: 252-254Google Scholar). In individuals with this disorder, the growth cartilage of the long bones undergoes minimal proliferation. Thus, FGF signaling is considered to be important for the support of cartilage growth. FGF-2 is the most potent mitogen for chondrocytes (5Kato Y. Hiraki Y. Inoue H. Kinoshita M. Yutani Y. Suzuki F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 685-690Google Scholar) and stabilizes the phenotypic expression of these cells (6Kato Y. Gospodarowicz D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 486-495Google Scholar). As we have reported previously, some proteinaceous components in cartilage synergistically stimulated DNA synthesis and the growth of cultured chondrocytes in vitro as well as stimulating proteoglycan synthesis in chondrocytes (6Kato Y. Gospodarowicz D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 486-495Google Scholar, 7Hiraki Y. Kato Y. Inoue H. Suzuki F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 333-337Google Scholar). These findings suggest that FGF, in combination with some unique growth-promoting component(s) in cartilage, may act on chondrocytes.In the course of the initial screening of these active components in the extracts of fetal bovine cartilage, we found at least two distinct factors in terms of their affinity to heparin (8Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. Kato Y. Barnes D. Sirbasku D.A. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1987: 313Google Scholar): one was eluted from a heparin-Sepharose column with buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl, and the other was eluted with buffer containing 1.2 M NaCl. In a previous study, we purified the active component with a higher affinity to heparin from the heparin-bound fraction of cartilage extracts and named it chondromodulin I (ChM-I) (9Hiraki Y. Tanaka H. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 971-977Google Scholar); ChM-I is a novel 25-kDa glycoprotein that is expressed specifically in cartilage. In the present study, we purified the other component with a lower affinity to heparin to homogeneity and named it chondromodulin II (ChM-II). Chondromodulin II has an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa on SDS-PAGE, and it stimulated proteoglycan synthesis in the cells. It also stimulated DNA synthesis in rabbit growth plate chondrocytes in vitro in both the absence and the presence of FGF-2. The complete amino acid sequence of ChM-II is reported here.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFirst, we attempted to confirm the bioactivity in the guanidinium extracts of cartilage from which contaminating FGF had been separated by heparin affinity chromatography. Fetal bovine epiphyseal cartilage was homogenized and extracted with 1 M guanidinium chloride. The resultant extract was fractionated with 45-65% acetone. Precipitates were solubilized in 4 M guanidinium chloride and fractionated by ultrafiltration. Materials with a molecular mass of 10-50 kDa were concentrated (9Hiraki Y. Tanaka H. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 971-977Google Scholar). A portion of this 10-50-kDa extract was fractionated into four on a heparin affinity column by batch elution. As shown in Table I, the 10-50-kDa extract strongly stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in the growth plate chondrocytes, largely due to contaminating FGF-like activity that was tightly bound to heparin (1Sullivan R. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2399-2403Google Scholar). FGF-2 is the most potent mitogen for chondrocytes (7Hiraki Y. Kato Y. Inoue H. Suzuki F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 333-337Google Scholar, 16Kato Y. Gospodarowicz D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 120: 354-363Google Scholar). FGF-2 stimulated DNA synthesis in quiescent primary chondrocytes in a dose-dependent manner, and treatment with an optimal dose of FGF-2 (0.4 ng/ml) resulted in a 5-15-fold increase of [3H]thymidine incorporation in the cells, depending on the batch of isolated cells (Table I and Fig. 1B, inset). Interestingly, the extract enhanced the effect of an optimal dose of FGF-2 that had produced maximal stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation. This synergistic activity was recovered in the 0.5-1.2 M NaCl eluate (heparin 1.2 M) from the heparin affinity column, and this fraction alone stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in the cells to 2 times the basal level. The 10-50-kDa extract strongly stimulated proteoglycan synthesis in chondrocytes, an expression of the differentiated phenotype (Table I and Fig. 1A). The half-maximal dose was about 40 µg/ml. This activity was also recovered in the heparin 1.2 M fraction (Table I and Fig. 1A). In contrast, FGF-2 had no effect on proteoglycan synthesis in the cells. As we have reported previously, ChM-I accounts for these bioactivities of the heparin 1.2 M fraction (9Hiraki Y. Tanaka H. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 971-977Google Scholar).TABLE IEffect of cartilage extract on DNA synthesis and proteoglycan synthesis in cultured growth plate chondrocytesAddition[35S]Sulfate incorporation, dpm/well (% of control)[3H]Thymidine incorporation, dpm/well (% of control)Without FGF-2With FGF-2None9252 ± 804 (100 ± 9)2437 ± 746 (100 ± 31)36657 ± 2807 (1504 ± 115)10-50 kDa extract18314 ± 610 (198 ± 7)30115 ± 5279 (1236 ± 217)80150 ± 6192 (3289 ± 254)Heparin pass8180 ± 584 (88 ± 6)2105 ± 573 (86 ± 24)28674 ± 1628 (1177 ± 67)Heparin 0.5 M I7713 ± 57 (83 ± 1)1573 ± 44 (65 ± 2)42834 ± 2201 (1758 ± 90)Heparin 0.5 M II16006 ± 472 (173 ± 5)3544 ± 71 (145 ± 3)42691 ± 573 (1752 ± 24)Heparin 1.2 M19114 ± 1030 (207 ± 11)6684 ± 355 (274 ± 15)77753 ± 4025 (3191 ± 165) Open table in a new tab However, residual proteoglycan synthesis-stimulating activity was also recovered in the fraction corresponding to the second protein peak eluted by 0.5 M NaCl (heparin 0.5 M II) as shown in Table I. The presence of TGF-β in cartilage has been documented (17Ellingsworth L.R. Brennan J.E. Fok K. Rosen D.M. Bentz H. Piez K.A. Seyedin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12362-12367Google Scholar, 18Thompson N.L. Flanders K.C. Smith J.M. Ellingsworth L.R. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 661-669Google Scholar), although there is no definitive evidence that it is activated in cartilage under physiological conditions. Proteoglycan synthesis in chondrocytes was markedly stimulated by TGF-β (19Hiraki Y. Inoue H. Hirai R. Kato Y. Suzuki F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 969: 91-99Google Scholar). Neutralizing antisera against bovine bone-derived TGF-β1 and -β2 failed to inhibit the proteoglycan synthesis-stimulating activity of heparin 0.5 M II, while these sera completely blocked the actions of the corresponding TGF-β subtypes (Table II). These findings suggested that a novel growth factor was recovered in this fraction. Therefore, we decided to purify the novel factor on the basis of its proteoglycan synthesis-stimulating activity in the 10-50-kDa extract. To facilitate purification of the activity, the 10-50-kDa extract (141 mg) was subfractionated on Sephacryl S-200 in the presence of 4 M guanidinium chloride and 1 M NaCl. The first protein peak was collected (17.3 mg), since all bioactivity of the extract was recovered in this fraction (9Hiraki Y. Tanaka H. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 971-977Google Scholar). The heparin-bound materials eluted by 0.5 M NaCl (heparin 0.5 M; 11.4 mg) and then the heparin-bound materials eluted by 1.2 M NaCl (heparin 1.2 M; 2.66 mg) were collected as described under “Materials and Methods.” The heparin 0.5 M fraction showed a dose-response curve with a slope shallower than that of the 10-50-kDa extract, while the heparin 1.2 M fraction stimulated proteoglycan synthesis with a dose-response profile parallel to that of the 10-50-kDa extract (Fig. 1A). The half-maximal dose of the heparin 0.5 M fraction was about 4 µg/ml. Finally, the heparin 0.5 M fraction was subjected to reverse-phase HPLC. The elution profile is shown in Fig. 2A. Bioassay defined the presence of a novel component (ChM-II; 60 µg), which had a longer retention time than ChM-I.TABLE IIEffects of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 antisera on proteoglycan synthesis in chondrocytes stimulated by cartilage extractAddition[35S]Sulfate incorporation (% of control)None+ Anti-TGF-β1+ Anti-TGF-β2Phosphate-buffered saline10099105TGF-β1176114179TGF-β2183188106Heparin 0.5 M II206195200 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Reverse-phase HPLC purification of ChM-II.

The column was developed with a linear 30-45% gradient of acetonitrile, 2-propanol (3:7, v/v) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for the initial 30 min and then with a linear 45-80% gradient for the following 10 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Chondromodulin II purified from the heparin 0.5 M fraction had an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa (Fig. 3A). The purified ChM-II stimulated proteoglycan synthesis in the growth plate chondrocytes in culture in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The half-maximal dose of ChM-II was about 75 ng/ml. Insulin-like growth factor-I or -II also stimulates proteoglycan synthesis in rabbit growth plate chondrocytes, the half-maximal dose being about 40 ng/ml. 2Y. Hiraki, unpublished data. However, SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3A) indicated that the purified ChM-II preparation did not contain insulin-like growth factor-I or -II to the extent that could account for its proteoglycan synthesis-stimulating activity. ChM-II also stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in chondrocytes (Fig. 1B). As shown in the inset of Fig. 1B, FGF-2 markedly stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in chondrocytes. Although it was assumed that FGF-2 in the 10-50-kDa extract was eliminated by heparin affinity chromatography, we examined the ChM-II preparation for possible contamination of FGF-2 by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody (bFM-2) against bovine brain-derived FGF-2 (12Yamada K. Yoshitake Y. Norimatsu H. Nishikawa K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1992; 17: 9-17Google Scholar, 13Matsuzaki K. Yoshitake Y. Matuo Y. Sakaki H. Nishikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9911-9915Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, immunoblotting clearly visualized the 10-50-ng rhFGF-2 used as the reference substance. In contrast, no immunoreactive material was detected in the ChM-II preparation (2.5 µg), suggesting that there was not more than a nanogram order of contamination of FGF-2 in the preparation. Further, the purified ChM-II enhanced [3H]thymidine incorporation in the presence of an optimal dose (0.4 ng/ml) of FGF-2 (Fig. 1B). This enhancing effect cannot be accounted for by contamination with FGF-2, since additional FGF-2 did not stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation any further. The purified ChM-II preparation had no effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation in cultured fibroblasts (data not shown). These results suggest that weak growth-promoting activity is also associated with ChM-II, although this agent plays a role primarily in the phenotypic expression of chondrocytes.Fig. 3SDS-PAGE of purified ChM-II. A, purified ChM-II (5 µg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis in 12.5% gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. B, purified ChM-II and rhFGF-2 were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis in 15% gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (lower panel; Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining).

Tanaka H. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 971-977Google Scholar), ChM-I was the major protein in the heparin 1.2 M fraction associated with growth-promoting activity for chondrocytes (Fig. 2B). N-terminal amino acid sequencing indicated that ChM-II was also present in the heparin 1.2 M fraction as one of the two minor proteins associated with bioactivity. The other minor active component (17 kDa on SDS-PAGE) was found between ChM-I and ChM-II, and this was termed chondromodulin III (ChM-III) (Fig. 2B). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of ChM-III was determined to be Ala-Lys-Lys-Gly-Gly-Glu-Lys-Lys-Lys-Gly-Arg, which is identical to the N-terminal sequence of ribosomal protein L31 (20Tanaka T. Kuwano Y. Kuzumaki T. Ishikawa K. Ogata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 45-48Google Scholar). Since ribosomal protein L31 has an additional three amino acids (Met-Ala-Pro), we assumed ChM-III to be a ribosomal protein with an N-terminal truncation. Thus, ChM-III seems irrelevant as a growth factor. It is possible that the extraordinarily high pI of the ribosomal protein may lead to erroneous stimulation of chondrocytes in culture. No ChM-III was found in the heparin 0.5 M fraction (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, Chester and co-workers (21Chester K.A. Robson L. Begent R.H.J. Talbot I.C. Pringle J.H. Primrose L. Macpherson A.J.S. Boxer G. Southall P. Malcolm A.D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1009: 297-300Google Scholar) reported overexpression of human ribosomal protein L31 mRNA in familial adenomatous polyposis and colorectal tumors. The gene is also expressed at abnormally high levels in various hematopoietic malignant tumor cells, but its expression was markedly down-regulated upon terminal differentiation of immature leukemic cell lines such as HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and K562 erythroleukemia cells in vitro (22Shimbara N. Sato C. Takashima M. Tanaka T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 235-239Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the ribosomal protein L31 is associated with growth regulation and differentiation. Recently, Fujita and co-workers (23Fujita Y. Okamoto T. Noshiro M. McKeehan W.L. Crabb J.W. Whitney R.G. Kato Y. Sato J.D. Takada K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 706-713Google Scholar) reported that the heparin-binding ribosomal protein L22 was copurified with FGF-1 from bovine brain. Thus, it is possible that these heparin-binding ribosomal proteins may have functional relevance in growth regulation through a potential interaction with FGF signaling.To determine the amino acid sequence, ChM-II was first reduced and protected by S-carboxymethylation. First, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of 37 residues was determined (Fig. 4). Then lysylendopeptidase digestion yielded several peptide fragments that were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Bakerbond C8 column. The amino acid sequences of the peptides were determined, and the C-terminal amino acid sequence was determined from one of the peptides isolated by the thiohydantoin formation method (15Hawke D.H. Lahm H.W. Shively J.E. Todd C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 298-307Google Scholar). Cyanogen bromide cleavage yielded two internal amino acid sequences of ChM-II. Finally, ChM-II was acetylated to protect lysine residues. The resultant acetylated ChM-II was digested with trypsin. Overlapping sequences of these fragments defined the complete primary amino acid sequence of ChM-II, which had one tryptophan near the N terminus, had six cysteine residues, and was rich in lysine residues (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Primary sequence of ChM-II. Thick right arrow, N-terminal amino acid sequence of S-carboxymethylated ChM-II; thin right arrow, sequences of peptides released by Achromobacter protease I digestion; left arrow, C-terminal sequence determined; right barb, sequences of peptides released by trypsin digestion; right stippled arrow, sequences of peptides released by CNBr cleavage.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In a previous study, we reported that cartilage-derived factor, which has a molecular mass of 16 kDa, stimulated proteoglycan synthesis in rabbit growth plate chondrocytes in culture (8Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. Kato Y. Barnes D. Sirbasku D.A. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1987: 313Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequence determined at that time was Gly-Pro-Trp-Ala-Ile-Ile-Xaa-Ala-Gly-Lys-Ser-Ser-Asn-Glu-Ile-Arg-Thr.2 The seventh residue was assumed to be cysteine that had been oxidized during purification. The N-terminal sequence of ChM-II completely matched the sequence above, suggesting that ChM-II was identical to cartilage-derived factor. In the study above (8Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. Kato Y. Barnes D. Sirbasku D.A. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1987: 313Google Scholar), we presented the amino acid composition of cartilage-derived factor assuming its molecular mass to be 16 kDa. The amino acid composition of ChM-II was compatible with that of cartilage-derived factor.Screening of data bases indicated that ChM-II had a novel amino acid sequence. We were unable to identify any previously characterized sequence motifs. However, ChM-II had a similarity to the repeats 1 and 2 of the mim-1 gene product (24Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). The similarity spread over the entire region of the repeats 1 and 2, each of which contains seven cysteine residues. The positions of the six cysteine residues in ChM-II were all conserved in these mim-1 repeats. The promyelocyte-specific mim-1 gene was first identified by differential hybridization as a v-myb regulated gene (24Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Google Scholar). The mim-1 gene is directly transcribed by c-Myb transcription factor in cooperation with other myeloid-specific transcription factors (25Burk O. Mink S. Ringwald M. Klempnauer K.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2027-2038Google Scholar, 26Ness S.A. Kowenz Leutz E. Casini T. Graf T. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 749-759Google Scholar). The mim-1 mRNA encodes a secretable 35-kDa protein that is specifically expressed in normal bone marrow promyelocytes. The MIM-1 protein is stored in granules of promyelocytes in the 35-kDa form as well as in the cleaved 15-18-kDa forms. In situ hybridization and immunolocalization of mim-1 expression have indicated that MIM-1 protein may participate in the regulation of granulopoietic differentiation as a local growth factor (24Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Google Scholar, 27Queva C. Ness S.A. Grasser F.A. Graf T. Vandenbunder B. Stehelin D. Development. 1992; 114: 125-133Google Scholar). However, no biological function of MIM-1 protein has yet been defined.Fig. 5Alignment of amino acid sequences of ChM-II and MIM-1 repeats. The complete amino acid sequence of ChM-II (1-133) was compared with repeat 1 of MIM-1 (31-165) and repeat 2 of MIM-1 (180-315). The positions of seven cysteine residues within the mim-1 repeats are indicated by asterisks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Although ChM-II has a sequence showing 57% homology to the mim-1 repeats, we assume that ChM-II is a product of a gene distinct from mim-1. It seems unlikely that ChM-II is derived from a larger protein with internal repeats, such as MIM-1, since we were unable to find a peptide with a similar amino acid sequence in our preparation of cartilage extract. Our preliminary sequence data for ChM-II cDNA indicated that the CUA codon corresponding to the C-terminal leucine residue was directly followed by a TAG stop codon (data not shown), while the putative cleavage products of MIM-1 have an extension of 11 amino acids at their C terminus. However, it is possible that there is some evolutionary relationship between the mim-1 gene and the gene encoding ChM-II. Although ChM-II was purified on the basis of its action on the growth and phenotypic expression of chondrocytes, its sequence similarity to MIM-1 implies that ChM-II may act on the growth and differentiation of other cell types, such as the cells involved in hematopoietic differentiation (28Introna M.

Thus, FGF signaling is considered to be important for the support of cartilage growth. FGF-2 is the most potent mitogen for chondrocytes (5Kato Y. Hiraki Y. Inoue H. Kinoshita M. Yutani Y. Suzuki F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 685-690Google Scholar) and stabilizes the phenotypic expression of these cells (6Kato Y. Gospodarowicz D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 486-495Google Scholar). As we have reported previously, some proteinaceous components in cartilage synergistically stimulated DNA synthesis and the growth of cultured chondrocytes in vitro as well as stimulating proteoglycan synthesis in chondrocytes (6Kato Y. Gospodarowicz D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 486-495Google Scholar, 7Hiraki Y. Kato Y. Inoue H. Suzuki F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 333-337Google Scholar). These findings suggest that FGF, in combination with some unique growth-promoting component(s) in cartilage, may act on chondrocytes.In the course of the initial screening of these active components in the extracts of fetal bovine cartilage, we found at least two distinct factors in terms of their affinity to heparin (8Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. Kato Y. Barnes D. Sirbasku D.A. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1987: 313Google Scholar): one was eluted from a heparin-Sepharose column with buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl, and the other was eluted with buffer containing 1.2 M NaCl. In a previous study, we purified the active component with a higher affinity to heparin from the heparin-bound fraction of cartilage extracts and named it chondromodulin I (ChM-I) (9Hiraki Y. Tanaka H. Inoue H. Kondo J. Kamizono A. Suzuki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 971-977Google Scholar); ChM-I is a novel 25-kDa glycoprotein that is expressed specifically in cartilage. In the present study, we purified the other component with a lower affinity to heparin to homogeneity and named it chondromodulin II (ChM-II).

NO oxidation of Ng resulted in a conformational change detectable by increased electrophoretic mobility upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Both the nonphosphorylated and PKC-phosphorylated Ng were susceptible to NO oxidation.

CaM also failed to protect DEANO-mediated oxidation of PKC-phosphorylated Ng with or without Ca2+. Oxidation of Ng by the various oxidants apparently resulted in the formation of intramolecular disulfide bond(s) as judged by a reduction of apparent Mr on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; this oxidized form, unlike the reduced form, did not bind to CaM-affinity column. The oxidized Ng was also a poorer substrate for PKC; both the reduced and oxidized forms had similar Km values, but the Vmax of the oxidized form was about one-fourth of the reduced one. When comparing the rate of DEANO-mediated nitrosation of Ng with other sulfhydryl-containing compounds, it became evident that Ng ranked as one of the best NO acceptors among those tested, including serum albumin, glutathione, and dithiothreitol. Ng present in the rat brain synaptosomal preparations was also oxidized by DEANO in a dose-dependent manner when analyzed by immunoblot with a polyclonal antibody against this protein.

INTRODUCTIONMethanosarcina barkeri can utilize methanol as sole source for methanogenesis and growth. The first step in the reduction of methanol to methane is the formation of an enzyme-bound methylcobamide catalyzed by methanol:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide methyltransferase (MT1) 1The abbreviations used are: MT1methanol:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide methyltransferaseCH3-S-CoM (methyl-coenzyme M)2-(methylthio)ethanesulfonic acidHS-CoM (coenzyme M)2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acidMT2Co-methyl-5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide:HS-CoM methyltransferaseMAPmethyltransferase activation proteinCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTESN-tris-(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acidHBI5-hydroxybenzimidazolylB12-HBI5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamideCAPS3(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acidkPakilopascal(s). (1van der Meijden P. e Brümmelstroet B.W. Poirot C.M. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 629-635Google Scholar). The methyl group of methylated MT1 is subsequently transferred to 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (coenzyme M, HS-CoM) by Co-methyl-5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide:HS-CoM methyltransferase (MT2) (2van der Meijden P. Heythuysen H.J. Pouwels A. Houwen F. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 238-242Google Scholar). As a result methyl-coenzyme M (CH3-S-CoM) is produced, which is the substrate for the final step in methanogenesis in all methanogens studied so far (3Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 39: 259-303Google Scholar).The corrinoid prosthetic group of MT1 can only be methylated by methanol when the central cobalt atom of the cobamide is present in the highly reduced Co(I) state (4van der Meijden P. van der Lest C. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 118: 760-766Google Scholar, 5van der Meijden P. Jansen L.P.J.M. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1983; 19: 247-251Google Scholar). Since this state is extremely sensitive toward oxidation, MT1 readily inactivates upon manipulation and even during catalysis. Reactivation is possible and requires participation of a reducing system, methyltransferase activation protein (MAP), and ATP (4van der Meijden P. van der Lest C. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 118: 760-766Google Scholar, 6Daas P.J.H. Gerrits K.A.A. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J.

The reducing system consists of hydrogen, hydrogenase, and ferredoxin. Ferredoxin is not absolutely required, though it stimulates the apparent reaction rate of methyl group transfer (6Daas P.J.H. Gerrits K.A.A. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1278-1283Google Scholar).Here, we report the UV-visible absorbance and electron paramagnetic resonance properties of the corrinoid prosthetic groups of MT1 under various additions of the reducing system, MAP, and ATP. From these results, the sequence of events leading to the formation of the cob(I)amide of MT1 is deduced. The activation of MT1 proceeds by a novel mechanism, which is presented in a model and compared to those described for other corrinoid-containing methyl group-transferring proteins.DISCUSSIONOptical and EPR spectroscopical studies were employed to determine the oxidation state of the central cobalt atom and the coordination of the ligands in the corrinoid protein MT1 under various additions of MAP, ATP, and a reducing system. After isolation MT1 contained somewhat less then 2 mol of B12-HBI/mol of α2β protein. The UV-visible light spectrum (Fig. 2) indicated that the prosthetic group was present in the hexa-coordinated Co(III) oxidation state with the nucleotide 5-hydroxybenzimidazole and water as the lower and upper ligands, respectively. Purified MT1 is inactive, and reactivation apparently requires the reduction of Co(III), which is brought about by a reducing system (H2, hydrogenase, and ferredoxin), MAP, and ATP (4van der Meijden P. van der Lest C. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 118: 760-766Google Scholar, 6Daas P.J.H. Gerrits K.A.A. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J.

Chem. 1996; 172: 22339-22345Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Incubation of MT1 with hydrogen, hydrogenase, and ferredoxin resulted in the reduction to the Co(II) state. EPR spectroscopy demonstrated that the HBI-base was still coordinated at this stage (base-on). Subsequent addition of both MAP and ATP induced a conversion of base-on into base-off Co(II) MT1. We previously showed MAP to be autophosphorylated by ATP; MAP-phosphate is able to substitute for the requirement of MAP and ATP (8Daas P.J.H. Wassenaar R.W. Willemsen P. Theunissen R.J. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 172: 22339-22345Google Scholar). The phosphorylated protein, thus effects MT1 in such a way that the HBI-base becomes dissociated. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4, an estimated 38% of the corrinoids became base-uncoordinated when MT1 (15.8 µM) was incubated with 7.5 µM MAP and excess ATP (5 mM). From this, it follows that the concentration of base-off MT1 amounted to 6.0 µM, which is about equimolar with respect to MAP added. In agreement with this conclusion, lower amounts of base-off cob(II)amide were obtained when the MAP concentration was decreased in the EPR experiments.The conversion of base-on into base-off cob(II) amide has an important implication. In non-protein bound B12-HBI, such base-off conversion causes the midpoint redox potential of the Co(II)/Co(I) couple to increase from -592 to -500 mV (21Daas P.J.H. Keltjens J.T. Hagen W.R. van der Drift C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 244-249Google Scholar). In a similar way, the action of MAP and ATP may facilitate the reduction in MT1 of cob(II)amide to the catalytically active species, the powerful nucleophile cob(I)amide. Although we could not detect the direct formation of cob(I)amide in our experiments, the findings that (i) the species is produced upon demethylation of methylated MT1 (5van der Meijden P. Jansen L.P.J.M. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1983; 19: 247-251Google Scholar) and (ii) methyl-B12-HBI bound to MT1 is formed during the activation of the enzyme in the presence of H2, hydrogenase, MAP, ATP and methanol (this paper; Refs. 4van der Meijden P. van der Lest C. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 118: 760-766Google Scholar, 5van der Meijden P. Jansen L.P.J.M. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. FEMS Microbiol.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1278-1283Google Scholar), demonstrate that cob(I)amide must play a role in the catalytic and reductive activation cycles. The cob(II)amide/cob(I)amide midpoint redox potentials are strongly influenced by the protein environment. In the corrinoid/iron-sulfur proteins involved in acetyl-CoA synthesis and degradation that have been isolated from Clostridium thermoaceticum (24Ragsdale S.W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 261-300Google Scholar) and from Methanosarcina thermophila (25Jablonski P.E. Lu W.-P. Ragsdale S.W. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 325-329Google Scholar), reduction to the catalytically active Co(I) state occurred at midpoint redox potentials of -504 mV (26Harder S.A. Lu W.-P. Feinberg B.F. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9080-9087Google Scholar) and -486 mV (25Jablonski P.E. Lu W.-P. Ragsdale S.W. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 325-329Google Scholar), respectively. Here, reduction has to be performed by electrons derived from the carbonyl (CO)/CO2 oxidation (E0′ = -520 mV). It is important to note that the enzymes do not require ATP for the activation; in the purified, inactive cob(II)amide state, the corrinoids are already contained in the (at neutral pH) thermodynamically unfavorable base-off state by the protein backbone. Here, the observed midpoint redox potentials about equaled the E0′ = -500 mV of the free base-off cob(II)amide/cob(I)amide couple. For a number of corrinoid-containing methyltransferases, midpoint potentials have been measured that were significantly higher than found for the corresponding B12 derivatives in solution (25Jablonski P.E. Lu W.-P. Ragsdale S.W. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 325-329Google Scholar, 26Harder S.A. Lu W.-P. Feinberg B.F. Ragsdale S.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9080-9087Google Scholar, 27Banerjee R.V.

For example, the reduction of base-on cob(II)amide to cob(I)amide in the membrane-bound methyltetrahydromethanopterin:HS-CoM methyltransferase complex from Methanosarcina mazei showed an E0′ as high as -426 to -450 mV, which is about 150 mV more positive than the analogous reduction of free B12-HBI (28Lu W.-P. Becher B. Gottschalk G. Ragsdale S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2245-2250Google Scholar). In comparing the UV-visible light spectra of MT1 with aqueous solutions of B12-HBI, we noticed some differences in the 400 nm and 500-600 nm regions (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Since MT1 does not contain Fe-S clusters (this paper) or other chromophoric groups (results not shown), this had to be caused by a conformational distortion of the corrin ring structure by the protein (29Gianotti C. Dolphin D. B12. John Wiley & Sons, New York1982: 393Google Scholar). Such distortion is likely to change the reduction potential of the prosthetic group. Incubation of methyltetrahydromethanopterin:HS-CoM methyltransferase with ATP and the methyl donor (methyltetrahydromethanopterin) raised the apparent midpoint potential another 200 mV (E0′ = -245 mV) (28Lu W.-P. Becher B. Gottschalk G. Ragsdale S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2245-2250Google Scholar), i.e. to a level where reduction becomes feasible at even very low hydrogen concentrations (E0′ = -414 mV). Remarkably, the 200 mV shift was not observed when the methyl donor was omitted, and the authors (28Lu W.-P. Becher B. Gottschalk G. Ragsdale S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2245-2250Google Scholar) proposed that the simultaneous action of ATP and the methylating substrate in a ternary enzyme complex is required for raising the redox potential. This may also apply to MT1. As pointed out above, we never observed the characteristic UV-visible light spectral features of cob(I)amide upon incubation under even high (100 kPa) hydrogen partial pressure of MT1 with MAP and ATP. However, the additional presence of methanol results in the formation of methyl-B12-HBI in MT1, suggesting a cooperative action of MAP-phosphate and methanol in the reductive activation (Fig. 5). The EPR experiments outlined above indicated that the amount of base-off cob(II) amide formed was dependent on the amount of MAP added. Yet, MT1 may be fully activated in the presence of substoichiometric amounts of MAP provided ATP and methanol is present (6Daas P.J.H. Gerrits K.A.A. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1278-1283Google Scholar, 8Daas P.J.H. Wassenaar R.W. Willemsen P. Theunissen R.J. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 172: 22339-22345Google Scholar). This may be explained by assuming that MAP becomes dephoshorylated after completion of the activation cycle of the MT1 molecule (8Daas P.J.H. Wassenaar R.W. Willemsen P. Theunissen R.J. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 172: 22339-22345Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Rephosphorylation by ATP then yields MAP-phosphate for activation of another molecule. Future investigations have to clarify questions with respect to the corrinoid midpoint redox potentials in MT1 and the effects hereon of MAP-phosphate and methanol.In order to be active, corrinoid-dependent methyltransferases often require an ATP-dependent reductive activation (3Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 39: 259-303Google Scholar, 30Matthews R.G. Banerjee R.V. Ragsdale S.W. Biofactors. 1990; 2: 147-152Google Scholar). As yet, only the activation mechanism of methionine synthase has been elucidated (31Banerjee R.V. Matthews R.G. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1450-1459Google Scholar). Here, ATP is the substrate in the formation of the potent methylating agent, S-adenosyl methionine, which traps Co(I) out of the thermodynamic unfavorable Co(II) to Co(I) reduction equilibrium (31Banerjee R.V. Matthews R.G. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1450-1459Google Scholar). In this paper, we have presented evidence that nature developed another approach to facilitate the generation of the active enzymes, notably by inducing in an ATP-dependent process the conformational change of the prosthetic group. Perhaps other corrinoid-containing methyltransferases from methanogens (3Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 39: 259-303Google Scholar) and other obligate anaerobic organisms (32Diekert G. Wohlfarth G. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1994; 66: 209-221Google Scholar) are activated in a similar fashion. INTRODUCTIONMethanosarcina barkeri can utilize methanol as sole source for methanogenesis and growth. The first step in the reduction of methanol to methane is the formation of an enzyme-bound methylcobamide catalyzed by methanol:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide methyltransferase (MT1) 1The abbreviations used are: MT1methanol:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide methyltransferaseCH3-S-CoM (methyl-coenzyme M)2-(methylthio)ethanesulfonic acidHS-CoM (coenzyme M)2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acidMT2Co-methyl-5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide:HS-CoM methyltransferaseMAPmethyltransferase activation proteinCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTESN-tris-(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acidHBI5-hydroxybenzimidazolylB12-HBI5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamideCAPS3(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acidkPakilopascal(s). (1van der Meijden P. e Brümmelstroet B.W. Poirot C.M. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 629-635Google Scholar). The methyl group of methylated MT1 is subsequently transferred to 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (coenzyme M, HS-CoM) by Co-methyl-5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide:HS-CoM methyltransferase (MT2) (2van der Meijden P. Heythuysen H.J. Pouwels A. Houwen F. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 238-242Google Scholar). As a result methyl-coenzyme M (CH3-S-CoM) is produced, which is the substrate for the final step in methanogenesis in all methanogens studied so far (3Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 39: 259-303Google Scholar).The corrinoid prosthetic group of MT1 can only be methylated by methanol when the central cobalt atom of the cobamide is present in the highly reduced Co(I) state (4van der Meijden P. van der Lest C. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 118: 760-766Google Scholar, 5van der Meijden P. Jansen L.P.J.M. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1983; 19: 247-251Google Scholar). Since this state is extremely sensitive toward oxidation, MT1 readily inactivates upon manipulation and even during catalysis. Reactivation is possible and requires participation of a reducing system, methyltransferase activation protein (MAP), and ATP (4van der Meijden P. van der Lest C. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 118: 760-766Google Scholar, 6Daas P.J.H. Gerrits K.A.A. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J.

The reducing system consists of hydrogen, hydrogenase, and ferredoxin. Ferredoxin is not absolutely required, though it stimulates the apparent reaction rate of methyl group transfer (6Daas P.J.H. Gerrits K.A.A. Keltjens J.T. van der Drift C. Vogels G.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1278-1283Google Scholar).Here, we report the UV-visible absorbance and electron paramagnetic resonance properties of the corrinoid prosthetic groups of MT1 under various additions of the reducing system, MAP, and ATP. From these results, the sequence of events leading to the formation of the cob(I)amide of MT1 is deduced. The activation of MT1 proceeds by a novel mechanism, which is presented in a model and compared to those described for other corrinoid-containing methyl group-transferring proteins."

RTs lack proofreading ability, and they proficiently extend primers with mismatched termini. Recombination reactions carried out in vitro are accompanied by a high frequency of base substitution errors, suggesting a relationship. Here we provide evidence that misincorporation during RNA-directed DNA synthesis promotes strand transfer recombination. Experiments involved measurement of DNA synthesis, RNase H-directed cleavage, and strand transfer synthesis from preformed mismatched primers on RNA templates by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RT in vitro. A significant pause in synthesis occurred from a G(primer). rA(template) mismatch compared to the synthesis from a correctly paired (T·rA) primer. The misincorporation-induced pause allowed an unusually large area of RT-RNase H-directed cleavage of the template RNA beneath the primer. Strand transfer to an acceptor molecule with sequence identical to the template RNA was about 50% more efficient than if the primer had had a correctly paired terminus. Overall transfer was measured over a large region of homology. Assuming that enhanced transfer occurs primarily at the site of the mismatch, the actual increase in transfer at that site must have been 1-2 orders of magnitude. Inclusion of a different acceptor molecule with complete complementarity to the originally mismatched 3′ primer terminus resulted in an additional 2-fold increase in strand transfer efficiency. Overall, these results suggest the mechanism by which misincorporation during minus strand DNA synthesis in retroviral replication would promote high frequency recombination.

Overall, these results suggest the mechanism by which misincorporation during minus strand DNA synthesis in retroviral replication would promote high frequency recombination. Heterogeneity of the retroviral genome is in part attributed to the error-prone nature of the replicative enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) 1The abbreviations used are: RTreverse transcriptaseHIV-1human immunodeficiency virus. (Coffin, 4Coffin J.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 1-4Google Scholar; Katz and Skalka, 17Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 409-445Google Scholar). RT catalyzes the conversion of a single-stranded RNA genome into a double-stranded proviral genome. The RT is a multifunctional enzyme having RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, RNase H, strand displacement, and strand transfer activities (Goff, 10Goff S.P. J. Acquired Immune Def. Syndrome. 1990; 3: 817-831Google Scholar). The role of RT in the generation of retroviral genome variation has been documented by a number of studies both in vivo and in vitro (Ji and Loeb, 15Ji J. Loeb L.A. Virology. 1994; 199: 323-330Google Scholar; Ji et al., 16Ji J. Hoffmann J. Loeb L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 47-52Google Scholar; Patel and Preston, 26Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10888-10896Google Scholar). The lack of an associated 3′ to 5′ exonuclease for proofreading, and the propensity of RT to extend a mismatched primer on a DNA or an RNA template, have been considered sources of variation in the retroviral genome (Roberts et al., 35Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Google Scholar). Recombination resulting from transfer of the growing primer between internal positions of one or more retroviral genomes appears to be another major source of variation (Temin, 40Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6900-6903Google Scholar). Base substitution, frameshift, deletion, and deletion with insertion errors have been widely observed in analysis both in vivo (Hahn, 12Hahn B.H. Science. 1986; 232: 1548-1553Google Scholar; Klarmann et al., 18Klarmann G.J. Schauber C.A. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9793-9802Google Scholar; Pathak and Temin, 27Pathak V.K. Temin H.M.

Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24195-24202Google Scholar). Base substitution and frameshift errors have been proposed to result from either direct misincorporation or a primer slippage mechanism (Bebenek et al., 3Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Roberts J.D. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16948-16956Google Scholar; Roberts et al., 36Roberts J.D. Preston B.D. Johnson L.A. Soni A. Loeb L.A. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 469-475Google Scholar). Deletion and deletion with insertion errors were postulated to occur by aberrant RT-mediated strand transfer from a mispaired primer terminus (Temin, 40Temin H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6900-6903Google Scholar). In studies performed in vitro using HIV-RT, a high degree of base substitution errors were found to accompany recombination (Peliska and Benkovic, 29Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Google Scholar, 30Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3890-3895Google Scholar; Patel and Preston, 26Patel P.H. Preston B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1710-1718Google Scholar). Such errors were suggested to derive from polymerase-catalyzed, non-template-directed nucleotide addition (Peliska and Benkovic, 29Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Google Scholar, 30Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3890-3895Google Scholar). reverse transcriptase human immunodeficiency virus. Fidelity of HIV-1 RT is 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than that of eukaryotic polymerases. It is also less accurate than other retroviral RTs (Mansky and Temin, 22Mansky L.M. Temin H.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5087-5094Google Scholar). Clearly, the difficulties encountered with the development of effective vaccine treatment or chemotherapy against HIV infection are primarily due to the rapid change of the genome resulting in variants. While RT can extend a mispaired primer terminus, the relative efficiencies of extension from purine·pyrimidine (A·C or C·A) or purine·purine (A·A, A·G, and G·A) mismatches have been found to vary significantly (Yu and Goodman, 44Yu H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10888-10896Google Scholar). While a limited number of investigations have addressed the characteristics of polymerization from mismatched primers on RNA templates, none have examined the action of the RNase H when RT encounters a mismatched terminus. We have proposed that there is a sequential relationship among sequence-dependent pausing, RNase H degradation of the template, and efficiency of transfer to a homologous acceptor template resulting in recombination (DeStefano et al., 6DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodríguez-Rodríguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Google Scholar, 8DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

We demonstrated a positive correlation between the specific positions of RT pausing on a donor template, and recombinational strand transfer from those positions (DeStefano et al., 6DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodríguez-Rodríguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Google Scholar, 8DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1710-1718Google Scholar). Elimination of a pause site without altering the local sequence caused reduction in strand transfer from the surrounding several nucleotides (Wu et al., 42Wu W. Blumberg B.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 325-332Google Scholar). Additionally, we observed that strand transfer was error-prone. It is often accompanied by base substitution and frameshift errors (Wu et al., 42Wu W. Blumberg B.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 325-332Google Scholar, 43Wu W. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1710-1718Google Scholar). Furthermore, it appears that upon adding a wrong nucleotide, the RT pauses before further synthesis (Bebenek and Kunkel, 2Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 85Google Scholar). From these previous findings, we hypothesized that misincorporation-related RT pausing during minus strand DNA synthesis allows the accompanying RNase H activity to degrade the template RNA beneath the growing primer to a greater extent than during normal synthesis as presented in Fig. 1, panel B. This should encourage the growing primer to free itself and reposition to another region on the same template, or to an acceptor template as shown in Fig. 1, panel C. Alternatively, an acceptor template with a region of complementarity to the primer could potentially invade the complex as shown in Fig. 1, panel D. Both situations would promote recombination. We previously developed a system to measure strand transfer recombination in vitro (DeStefano et al., 6DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodríguez-Rodríguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Google Scholar). It involves primer extension on a template designated the donor, in the presence of a homologous but different length template designated the acceptor (DeStefano et al., 6DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodríguez-Rodríguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Google Scholar). With this system, the efficiency of recombination, and the structure of recombination products can be measured (DeStefano et al., 6DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodríguez-Rodríguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Google Scholar; Wu et al., 42Wu W. Blumberg B.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 325-332Google Scholar). In the current report, we examined the effect of misincorporation induced pausing on RT RNase H activity, and the consequences of that altered RNase H activity on strand transfer. Recombinant HIV-RT in its native form was graciously provided to us by Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). This heterodimer RT has a specific activity of approximately 40,000 units/mg. One unit of RT is defined as the amount required to incorporate 1 nmol of dTTP into poly(rA)-oligo(dT) in 10 min at 37°C. This amount corresponds to approximately 214 fmol of purified RT. About 250 µg of the supplied lyophilized RT sample was dissolved in 500 µl of enzyme dilution buffer. Aliquots of the RT were stored frozen at -70°C, and a fresh aliquot was used for each experiment. Analysis of this RT sample by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with silver revealed an essentially homogeneous preparation containing only the p51 and p66 subunits at stoichiometric levels. The preparation was free of detectable contaminating nucleases (data not shown). T4 polynucleotide kinase was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. DNase I, dNTPs, alkaline phosphatase, rNTPs, RNase inhibitor, T7 RNA polymerase, and quick spin gel filtration columns were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. T4 RNA ligase was purchased from New England Biolabs. Radionucleotides were from DuPont NEN. Plasmids pBS+ and pBS+(Δ) have been described previously (DeStefano et al., 6DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodríguez-Rodríguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Google Scholar). RNA templates 1 (142-mer), 2 (189-mer), and 3 (189-mer) were generated by run-off transcription by T7 RNA polymerase from plasmids pBS+(Δ), pBS+, and pCP 3, respectively following digestion by BstNI. Following DNase I digestion, the samples were gel-purified and isolated upon visualization by UV shadowing as described previously (Palaniappan et al., 24Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4861-4869Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of RNA molecules was carried out using calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. When required, 5′ end labeling was carried out with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase. 3′ end labeling of the RNA was performed by using T4 RNA ligase and 32pCp. RNA samples were quantitated by “shift-up” assays using labeled primers of known concentrations as described previously (DeStefano et al., 7DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4330-4338Google Scholar; Palaniappan et al., 24Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4861-4869Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel, 20Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar; Kunkel et al., 21Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar) of the parent plasmid pBS+ was carried out using the primer 5′-AAATTGTTCTCCGCTC, and the resultant variant was confirmed by sequencing and referred to as plasmid pCP3. The RNA transcript (RNA template 3) generated from pCP3 differed by a single base from RNA template 2 at position 136 relative to the 5′ end. RNA and DNA was annealed in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, and 80 mM KCl with a 3:1 molar ratio of DNA to RNA. Components were mixed, heated to 60°C for 10 min, and slow cooled to 37°C over 90 min. For strand transfer experiments, the RNA/DNA hybrids were separated from excess primer on native polyacrylamide gels and hybrids eluted by procedures described previously (Palaniappan et al., 25Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2063-2070Google Scholar). Final reaction mixtures (25 µl) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1.0 mM EDTA, 34 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 2 nM substrate, and varying amounts of HIV-1 RT. In all cases, the enzyme was preincubated with the substrate for 5 min at 37°C. The reaction was initiated with MgCl2, incubated for 15 min, and terminated with 25 µl of 2 × termination mixture (90% formamide (v/v), 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.1% each of xylene cyanole and bromphenol blue). For time-course analysis, a mixture of all components except MgCl2 was prepared. Subsequent to the initiation of reaction with MgCl2, 25-µl aliquots were drawn at varying time intervals, and the reaction terminated by adding them to an equal volume of the 2 × termination mixture. Eight-µl samples were then subjected to denaturing electrophoresis to resolve reaction products. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography by employing standard protocols (Sambrook et al., 38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Exposures were carried out using Kodak XAR-5 films unless otherwise specified. In some experiments, the products resulting from catalysis during a single binding event of the RT to the substrates were examined by adding excess trapping polymer heparin (8 µg) at the start of the reaction (DeStefano et al., 8DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (a): 161-168Google Scholar; Palaniappan et al., 24Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4861-4869Google Scholar). After RT was preincubated with the substrate, the reaction was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 in the presence of heparin. Presence of excess heparin allows only a single round of RT action, because it traps any RT molecule that dissociates from template-primer. A control reaction was included to ensure the presence of adequate trap. This reaction was carried out by allowing the enzyme to prebind to the substrate in the presence of excess trap prior to the initiation of reaction with MgCl2. Conditions for polymerase assays were identical to those for RNase H assays, except that all four dNTPs were present in the reaction mix at 50 µM final concentration. Reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2 and dNTPs. Time-course reactions were performed as described above. When degradation of RNA was monitored during DNA synthesis, a 5′-labeled RNA template was employed. However, when only DNA extension products were monitored, a 5′-labeled DNA primer was employed. Product analysis was carried out as above. Conditions for strand transfer reactions were same as the DNA polymerase assays, except that various acceptor templates were added to the reaction. The transfer efficiencies were determined by employing the formula, efficiency = T/(T + F), expressed as a percentage, as described previously (DeStefano et al., 6DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodríguez-Rodríguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Google Scholar). “T” and “F” represent quantities of maximum length transfer products and full-length extension products on the original or donor template, respectively. RNA molecular markers were made either by alkaline treatment of 5′-labeled RNA substrates to generate a nucleotide hydrolysis ladder, or by RNase T1 treatment to generate a G-ladder as described in the protocols supplied with the Pharmacia RNA sequencing kit. HindIII-digested fragments of plasmid pBR322 (Life Technologies, Inc.), which were labeled at the 5′ end, were also run in each gel as additional size markers. The nucleotide sequences of the RNA template 1, RNA acceptor 2, and RNA acceptor 3 that were generated from pBS(Δ), pBS+, and pCP3, respectively, are listed below.

The DNA components are as follows: DNA template 1, 5′-TGAAATTGTT ATCCGCTCAC AATTCCACAC AACATACGAG; DNA primer 1, 5′-CTCGTATGTTGTGTGGAATTGTGAGCGGAT; DNA primer 2, 5′-CTCGTATGTTGTGTGGAATTGTGAGCGGAG. We postulate that a misincorporation during synthesis of minus strand DNA would cause HIV RT to pause. This pause would lead to enhanced RNase H-directed cleavage of the template near the pause site, as illustrated in Fig. 1, panel B. This cleavage should then promote recombination by RT-mediated strand transfer as proposed by our model in Fig. 1 (panels C and D). In order to examine the consequences of a misincorporation during minus strand DNA synthesis, we employed an RNA template annealed with DNA primers having or lacking a 3′ terminal mismatch. The template RNA was a 142-mer transcript prepared as described under “Methods.” Substrates A and B were prepared by annealing either 5′ end-labeled DNA primers 1 or 2, respectively, to the template RNA (Fig. 2). Primer 2 forms a 3′ terminal G (primer)·rA (template) mismatch when annealed to the template. At the same location, primer 1 has a complementary 3′ terminal T (primer)·rA (template). Extension of either primer should result in the formation of a 118 nucleotide long template-directed full-length product (Fig. 3A). The band intensities of all extended products from each terminus were quantitated using PhosphorImager analysis. We first measured DNA extension over a range of enzyme concentrations for a 15-min time period (Fig. 3A). At all enzyme concentrations examined, the overall production of extended products from the mismatched terminus was about 30% of that from the complementary terminus.Fig. 3RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity from a mispaired primer terminus. Substrates A and B were used, and DNA extension was monitored by employing 5′ radiolabeled DNA primers. A schematic representation of substrates A and B is shown at the top. The asterisk represents the position of the radiolabel. Panel A is an analysis of the effect of varying amounts of HIV-1 RT on DNA extension from correctly paired primer versus mismatched primer termini. The DNA primers were present in 3-fold excess over the RNA template. RT concentration is indicated above each lane. Panel B is a time-course analysis of DNA extension on substrates A and B performed with 2 units of RT. Two units of activity is equivalent to using 427 fmol of the purified RT. Time points are indicated above each lane. Products were separated on 8% urea-polyacrylamide gels. The numbers on the left of the autoradiogram represent the product length as determined by DNA molecular weight markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to detect whether there is a misincorporation induced pause in DNA synthesis by HIV-1 RT as proposed in Fig. 1 (panel B), we performed a comparative time course of synthesis on substrates A and B. Results of the analysis are presented in Fig. 3B. A significant delay in synthesis was observed with substrate B compared to synthesis from substrate A (Fig. 3B, compare products in lanes 0-16 min). The above results demonstrate that the RT pauses after misincorporation on our experimental substrate. Previous results have shown that the affinity of the RT for the mispaired primer and matched primers are similar (Yu and Goodman, 44Yu H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10888-10896Google Scholar), suggesting that the RT remains bound after generation of the mispair. Under those circumstances RT-RNase H would still be active. Use of paired versus mispaired primers offered us the opportunity to determine whether misincorporation-induced pausing alters the efficiency of RNase H cleavage near the mismatched site as proposed by the model. We employed substrates A (T·rA) and B (G·rA) again, but this time 5′ labeled the 142-mer template RNA instead of the DNA primers. We determined the fate of the template RNA in the presence or absence of DNA synthesis. A time-course analysis of RNase H cleavage in the absence or presence of dNTPs is presented in Fig. 4 (A and B, respectively). Without dNTPs, cleavage by RT RNase H generates labeled primary and secondary cleavage products about 102 and 94 nucleotides long. The initial endonucleolytic cleavage position is at a distance slightly smaller than the approximate 20-nucleotide spatial separation of DNA polymerase and RNase H active sites, as determined by x-ray crystallographic studies (Jacobo-Molina et al., 14Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Secondary cleavage products accumulate during the reaction. These are shorter than the primary products by an additional 8 nucleotides. They result from the previously demonstrated processive 3′ to 5′ directional nucleolytic activity of RT-RNase H (DeStefano et al., 7DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4330-4338Google Scholar; Palaniappan et al., 25Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2063-2070Google Scholar; Schatz et al., 39Schatz O. Mous J. Le Grice S.F.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1171-1176Google Scholar). The rate of formation of the secondary cleavage products is faster in substrate B than in A (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 0-16 min). It is evident that the presence of a mismatched primer terminus facilitates the processive RT RNase H directional cleavage activity. To determine the effect of misincorporation on RT-RNase H activity during minus strand DNA synthesis, we analyzed the products of RNase H cleavage of template RNA in the presence of dNTPs. The degradation of the 142-mer template RNA was examined with substrates A and B (Fig. 4B). An evident difference between the distribution of products with the two substrates is the accumulation of 5′ labeled products of lengths 20 nucleotides and below during the course of the reaction with the fully annealed substrate A (Fig. 4B, left panel). These products probably originate from cleavages that occur when the enzyme has reached the 5′ end of RNA templates. The products about 20 nucleotides long are reminiscent of the cleavage site distance dictated by the spatial separation of the RT active sites. That is, the positioning of the polymerase active site at the very last nucleotide of a fully extended primer would place the RNase H active site 14-20 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the RNA. The formation of smaller length products of sizes around 9-14 is most likely mediated by the additional 3′ to 5′ directional nucleolytic activity. Several additional intermediate products, which were present at the early time points but disappeared during the course of the reaction, are apparently derived from cleavages determined by the normal sequence-dependent pausing of RT. With the mismatched substrate B, virtually all of the early cleavages are limited to those making 94- and 102-nucleotide labeled products. These are products expected from cleavages made by RT delayed at the mismatched terminus. Since there is a delay in DNA synthesis from the mismatched primer, the cleavage products that would normally be seen with the fully annealed primer begin to appear only later in the reaction. The products that are 94 and 102 nucleotides long are absent in reactions with the fully annealed substrate A. It is very likely that the polymerase moves from that position so quickly that cleavage occurs on relatively few templates. Alternatively, cleavages are made at that position, but subsequent cleavages made closer to the 5′ end of the RNA destroy the 94- and 102-nucleotide products. In order to determine whether there is more cleavage during primer elongation on a mismatched versus fully complementary primer, we measured generation of cleavage products of 3′ end-labeled template RNA in substrates A and B (Fig. 5). During synthesis, cleavage is expected to begin on the template beneath the RT bound to the original length primer and progress toward the 5′ end of the RNA. The 3′ labeled products of template cleavage near the original 3′ end of the primer are not expected to be shortened by cleavages that occur during primer elongation. However, more extensive clea"
https://openalex.org/W2118717863,"We reported recently that angiotensin II (AII) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) transiently inhibit interleukin 6 (IL-6)-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3) and subsequent formation of sis-inducing factor-A (SIF-A). However, the AII-mediated inhibition was independent of PMA-sensitive isoforms of protein kinase C (Bhat, G. J., Thekkumkara, T. J., Thomas, W. G., Conrad, K. M., and Baker, K. M. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 19059-19065). In this study, we demonstrate that the inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3/SIF-A by AII is concentration-dependent and does not involve degradation of Stat3 protein. We hypothesized that the activation profile of the AII- and PMA-induced mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade may be different from that of IL-6 and could contribute to the inhibitory effect; therefore, blocking the MAP kinase pathway at the level of MAPK kinase (MAPKK) would attenuate this inhibitory effect. AII and PMA rapidly induced high levels of MAP kinase activity (8-fold), which contrasted with the delayed and weak activation by IL-6 (1.7-fold). Treatment of cells with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAPKK1, attenuated the inhibitory effects of AII and PMA on IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and SIF-A formation. These data suggest that differences in magnitude and/or duration of activation of the MAP kinase cascade differentially affects the status of Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation, and that MAPKK1 or a downstream intermediate is involved in the inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3 by AII and PMA. Modulatory cross-talk between AII and IL-6 may have relevance in pathophysiological conditions such as cardiac hypertrophy and in acute phase and inflammatory responses.

These include vasoconstriction, regulation of salt and fluid homeostasis, induction of gene expression, and promotion of growth in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells (1Aceto J.F. Baker K.M. Am.

More recently, AII has been shown to activate components of the JAK-STAT pathway, which include members of the JAK kinases and STAT family of transcription factors (12Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J.

Activation of these signal transduction pathways may collectively contribute to the ability of AII to cause hypertrophic and hyperplastic effects in cardiovascular cells (15Booz G.W. Baker K.M.

The JAK-STAT pathway is initiated by the binding of cytokines and growth factors to their cognate cell surface receptors. Receptors that lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (e.g. IL-6 and IFN-γ) cause tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins in the cytoplasm through the activation of JAK kinases (16Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar, 17Ilhe J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Google Scholar), whereas receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (e.g. epidermal growth factor) tyrosine phosphorylate STAT members through a JAK-independent pathway (18Lehman D.W. Pisharody S. Flickinger T.W. Commane M.A. Sclessinger J. Kerr I.M. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 369-375Google Scholar, 19Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W. Witthuhn B.A. Tang B. Cohen S.

Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, some STAT proteins (Stat1 and Stat3) are also phosphorylated at serine residues, possibly through the action of MAP kinases (20David M. Petricoin III, E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Google Scholar, 21Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Google Scholar, 22Zhang X.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 137-143Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation appears to enhance the transactivating potential of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat3 (20David M. Petricoin III, E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Google Scholar, 21Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Google Scholar). Thus, two of the major signal transduction pathways, i.e. the MAP kinase pathway and the JAK-STAT pathway, appear to modulate the capacity of STAT proteins to induce gene transcription through phosphorylation. Using CHO-K1 cells expressing AT1A receptors (T3CHO/AT1A), we recently reported the ability of AII to transiently inhibit IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent formation of the DNA-protein complex, SIF-A (13Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19059-19065Google Scholar). We also observed that the phorbol ester PMA, which activates PKC, mimics the actions of AII in inhibiting IL-6-induced SIF-A formation. However, in PKC down-regulated cells, PMA failed to inhibit the IL-6-induced SIF-A response, but the inhibitory actions of AII were unaffected (13Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19059-19065Google Scholar). These data suggested that AII-dependent inhibitory actions were not mediated by PMA-sensitive isoforms of PKC. We hypothesized that differential activation of the MAP kinase cascade may be responsible for inhibition of the IL-6-induced Stat3/SIF-A response by AII and PMA. Therefore, inhibiting the MAP kinase pathway would prevent the inhibitory effect. In the present study, we demonstrate that AII and PMA induce high levels of MAP kinase activity, in contrast to the weak MAP kinase activation by IL-6. Inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway by treatment with the MAPKK1 inhibitor PD98059 significantly attenuated the AII- and PMA-mediated inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and SIF-A formation. These data suggest, for the first time, involvement of the MAP kinase pathway in the negative regulation of IL-6-induced Stat3 signaling by AII. Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, Geneticin, tissue culture flasks, and IL-6 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc; AII was purchased from U. S.

Preparation of nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (12Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol.

Serum-starved cells were treated with various agents for the indicated times; then the cells were scraped and washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 1% aprotinin, 0.1% leupeptin, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15% glycerol) for 15 min on ice. Protein concentrations were determined, and samples were stored at -80°C. To 100 µg of total cell extract (in 100 µl), 2 volumes of lysis buffer (200 µl) were added and further diluted with 2 volumes of buffer A (200 µl) (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM Na3VO4). To the samples, 500 ng each of two different anti-Stat3 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Upstate Biotechnology) were added and incubated at 4°C on a rocker for 8 h. Protein A/G-agarose was added to the samples, and incubation continued for 4 h at 4°C. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed with 1 ml of buffer A, and dissolved in SDS-sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (8%) electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antiphosphotyrosine antibody as described previously (13Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19059-19065Google Scholar). The blots were stripped and reprobed with monoclonal anti-Stat3 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) as described previously (13Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol.

Invest. 1995; 96: 69-77Google Scholar). Ten µg of the lysate in SDS-loading buffer were loaded on a SDS-polyacrylamide mini gel (80 × 50 × 0.75 mm) copolymerized with 1 mg/ml myelin basic protein. After electrophoresis, the gel was sequentially incubated for 1 h each with 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 20% 2-propanol, followed by 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 5 mM dithiothreitol (buffer A). Denaturation and renaturation of the proteins were performed by incubating the gel, respectively, in buffer A containing 6 M guanidine HCl for 1 h and buffer A containing 0.04% Tween 40 for 16 h at 4°C. The gel was pre-incubated with kinase assay buffer (40 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EGTA, and 5 mM magnesium acetate) at room temperature for 30 min, followed by another incubation at the same temperature, in kinase assay buffer containing 10 µCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP for 90 min. The gel was washed six times (20 min each) with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate and then dried and exposed to x-ray film or to a phosphor screen. Quantitations were made on an SF PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics) using the ImageQuant Program. We demonstrated previously that in CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with the angiotensin AT1A receptor (T3CHO/AT1A), IL-6 induced nuclear Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and SIF-A formation. Supershift assays with antibodies to Stat3 demonstrated that Stat3 was a component of IL-6-induced SIF-A complex in these cells (13Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19059-19065Google Scholar). In addition, pretreatment of T3CHO/AT1A cells with AII resulted in an inhibition of the IL-6-induced nuclear Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and SIF-A formation (13Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19059-19065Google Scholar). In the present study, we performed experiments to determine if this AII-mediated inhibition occurs in a concentration-dependent manner in total cell lysates. Serum-starved T3CHO/AT1A cells were treated with different concentrations of AII for 25 min and then were stimulated with IL-6 for 15 min. Total cell lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-Stat3 antibody, and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Fig. 1A demonstrates the concentration-dependent inhibition of the IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation by AII. Complete inhibition of the IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation by AII was observed at 5 nM or greater (Fig. 1A, lanes 3-6), and inhibition was 50% at 1 nM AII (Fig. 1A, lane 7). When the blot corresponding to Fig. 1A was stripped and reprobed with anti-Stat3 antibody, an equal amount of Stat3 was present in all the lanes (Fig. 1B), suggesting that AII causes the inhibition of Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation without affecting the total Stat3 protein content. We next determined if the inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation in the total cell extract in Fig. 1 was reflected in the concentration-dependent inhibition of nuclear SIF-A activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells treated with IL-6 alone or treated sequentially with AII and IL-6. The samples were analyzed in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using c-fos regulatory element SIE. Fig. 1C demonstrates the concentration-dependent inhibition of IL-6-induced nuclear SIF-A response by AII. Densitometric analysis of the bands of Fig. 1C indicated that the inhibition of IL-6-induced SIF-A activity by AII was one-half maximal at a concentration of 1.3 nM (data not shown). This is similar to the Kd of AII-binding to the AT1A receptor in T3CHO/AT1A cells (24Thekkumkara T.J. Du J. Dostal D.E. Motel T.J. Thomas W.G. Baker K.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 146: 79-89Google Scholar). The results obtained in Fig. 1 collectively demonstrate that: 1) AII potently inhibits the IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent formation of SIF complex A; and 2) the inhibitory actions of AII do not involve the degradation of Stat3 protein. Numerous studies indicate that the rate, magnitude, and duration of signals transmitted through the MAP kinase cascade may significantly contribute to the ability of different ligands to cause different end responses (27Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar, 28Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Google Scholar, 29Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Google Scholar, 30Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1995; 4: 694-701Google Scholar, 31Dikic I. Schlesinger J. Lax I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 702-708Google Scholar). It was shown that epidermal growth factor, by a transient MAP kinase activation, caused PC12 cells to proliferate, whereas in the same cells, NGF, through a sustained activation of MAP kinase, caused the cells to differentiate (reviewed in Ref. 27Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar). To explain the inhibitory effects of AII and PMA on IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation/SIF-A formation, we hypothesized that: 1) the AII- and PMA-induced MAP kinase activation profile may be significantly different from that of IL-6 and that such differences in the MAP kinase activation profile may contribute to the inhibitory effects of AII and PMA; and 2) signals elicited by AII and PMA may converge at the level of MAPKK and, therefore, blocking the MAP kinase pathway at the level of MAPKK would attenuate the inhibitory effects. Using an in-gel kinase assay, we first determined the MAP kinase activation profile of AII and PMA and compared this to the MAP kinase activity stimulated by IL-6. Both AII (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-9) and PMA (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-6) rapidly induced high levels of MAP kinase activity (8-fold at 2 min), which was sustained throughout the time periods examined (2 h for AII and 30 min for PMA). In contrast, the IL-6-elicited response was weak (1.7-fold at 10 min) and transient, returning to basal levels within 30 min (Fig. 2A, lanes 10-15). We reasoned that, either alone or in combination, the faster kinetics, higher magnitude, and sustained activation of MAP kinase by AII and PMA observed in Fig. 2 may play a role in the inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent SIF-A complex formation. To address this question, we used PD98059, a recently developed MAPKK1 inhibitor (32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar, 33Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar, 34Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Google Scholar, 35Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Google Scholar), to block the AII- and PMA-induced MAP kinase pathway. The use of PD98059 to block activation of the MAP kinase pathway induced by a variety of agents, including platelet-derived growth factor, NGF, insulin, and PMA, has been reported recently (32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar, 33Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar, 34Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Google Scholar, 35Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Google Scholar). This compound exhibits a high degree of selectivity for inhibiting MAPKK1 activation both in vivo and in vitro, without affecting the function of other serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases (32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar). Fig. 2C demonstrates the concentration-dependent activation of MAP kinase by AII (lanes 2-5) and its inhibition by 20 µM PD98059 (lanes 6-9). PD98059 completely inhibited the MAP kinase activity elicited by AII at 1 nM (Fig. 2C, lane 9). As shown previously for other agonists, at higher concentrations of AII (5 nM or greater), inhibition by PD98059 was partial (Fig. 2C, lanes 7 and 6), possibly due to the ability of AII to induce MAP kinase through multiple routes, which may involve MAPKK2 (15Booz G.W. Baker K.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 537-543Google Scholar). The same concentration of PD98059 (20 µM) completely inhibited the MAP kinase activity elicited by IL-6 (Fig. 2C, lanes 10 and 11) and caused a 90% reduction in the PMA (100 nM)-induced MAP kinase activity (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 3). We next determined if treatment of cells with PD98059 would attenuate the AII-mediated inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear SIF-A response. For these experiments, AII was used at 1 nM to inhibit the IL-6 response, because activation of MAP kinase at this concentration of AII was completely inhibitable by 20 µM PD98059. Total lysates were prepared from cells treated with IL-6, AII + IL-6, or PD98059 + AII + IL-6. Following immunoprecipitation with anti-Stat3 antibodies, samples were separated electrophoretically, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Fig. 3A demonstrates that treatment of cells with 1 nM AII for 25 min resulted in a significant inhibition of Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation, in particular the Mr 89,000 form (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Cells that were exposed to the MAPKK1 inhibitor PD98059, before the addition of AII and IL-6, showed no loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of either forms (Mr 89,000 and Mr 92,000) of Stat3 (Fig. 3A, lane 4). To determine if Stat3 protein was present in equal amounts in each lane, the blot in Fig. 3A was stripped and reprobed with anti-Stat3 antibody. Fig. 3B demonstrates that Stat3 is present in similar amounts in the immunoprecipitated samples of Fig. 3A. These results suggest that inhibition of MAPKK1 by PD98059 attenuates AII-mediated inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation. We substantiated the above results by determining the nuclear SIF-A response, using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells treated with IL-6, AII + IL-6, and PD98059 + AII + IL-6 and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assays, using 32P-labeled SIE. Fig. 4A demonstrates that AII pretreatment (1 nM) caused a 50% inhibition of the IL-6-induced SIF-A response (lanes 2 and 3). PD98059 significantly attenuated this inhibitory action of AII (Fig. 4A, lane 4). To determine if the intensities of SIF-A are reflected in the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3, the nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Stat3 antibodies and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4B, a higher amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 was present in cells pretreated with PD98059, before addition of AII and IL-6 (lane 4), suggesting that PD98059 attenuates the inhibitory actions of AII. To determine if the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 in these nuclear extracts was related to the amount of Stat3 protein, samples used in Fig. 4A were directly analyzed in a Western blot and probed with anti-Stat3 antibodies. Fig. 4C demonstrates that the Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation observed in Fig. 4B correlates with the amount of Stat3 protein, consistent with tyrosine phosphorylation being required for nuclear translocation (16Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar). Pretreatment of T3CHO/AT1A cells with PMA interferes with the IL-6-induced Stat3/SIF-A response (13Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19059-19065Google Scholar); therefore, we determined the ability of PD98059 to reverse this inhibitory effect. Analogous experiments as described for AII (Fig. 4) were performed with PMA as the inhibitory agent. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells treated with IL-6, PMA + IL-6, or PD98059 + PMA + IL-6 and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and immunoblotting. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, PD98059 significantly attenuated the PMA-mediated inhibition of IL-6-induced SIF-A (Fig. 5A, lanes 2-4) and Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5B, lanes 2-4). The partial reversal of the inhibitory effect of PMA by PD98059, observed in Fig. 5, A and B, possibly reflects the incomplete inhibition of PMA-induced MAP kinase activation by PD98059 shown in Fig. 1D. PD98059 alone had no significant effect on the IL-6-induced SIF-A response (Fig. 5A, lane 5). To determine if PKC activation was required for the PMA-mediated inhibitory action, cells were treated with PMA for 24 h to down-regulate PKC activity, and the effect of PMA to inhibit the IL-6-induced Stat3/SIF-A response was determined. In PKC down-regulated cells, PMA failed to inhibit the IL-6-induced SIF-A response (Fig. 5A, lanes 7 and 8) and Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5B, lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that PKC activation was required for PMA actions (13Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19059-19065Google Scholar). As shown above for AII, the degree of Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation in these nuclear extracts was proportional to the amount of Stat3 protein (Fig. 5C). Thus, the results of Fig. 5 suggest that: 1) inhibition of MAPKK1 by treatment with PD98059 attenuates the PMA-mediated inhibitory actions on IL-6-induced nuclear Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and SIF-A complex formation; and 2) the PD98059 sensitive inhibition by PMA requires PKC activation. The studies described in this manuscript are an extension of our previous report on the ability of AII and PMA to inhibit IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and SIF-A formation (13Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19059-19065Google Scholar). The major finding in the present study is that exposure of CHO-K1 cells (expressing the angiotensin AT1A receptor) to the specific MAPKK1 inhibitor PD98059 attenuated both the AII- and PMA-mediated interference of IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and SIF-A formation. These results suggest that MAPKK1 or a downstream effector(s) is involved in the inhibitory actions of AII and PMA, indicating a role for the AII- and PMA-induced MAP kinase pathway in the inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3 activation. Comparison of the MAP kinase activation profile indicated that the AII- and PMA-induced activation profile was significantly different from that of IL-6 with respect to rate, magnitude, and duration. Angiotensin II and PMA, both of which induced MAP kinase activity with greater magnitude (8-fold) and duration (2 h and 30 min, respectively), potently inhibited IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, the weak MAP kinase activation by IL-6 (1.7-fold) was not associated with inhibition of Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation. How the AII-induced MAP kinase pathway modulates the inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation is not known. Several reports suggest that differences in the strength and duration of MAP kinase activation can cause distinct end responses (reviewed in Ref. 27Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar). For example, in PC12 cells, sustained MAP kinase activation (1 h) by NGF was shown to cause cell differentiation, whereas transient activation (less than 20 min) by epidermal growth factor caused cell proliferation (27Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar, 29Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Google Scholar). Sustained activation of MAP kinase by NGF resulted in translocation of MAP kinase to the nucleus (29Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Google Scholar, 31Dikic I. Schlesinger J. Lax I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 702-708Google Scholar, 36Nguyen T.T. Scimeca J.-C. Filloux C. Peraldi P. Carpentier J.-L. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9803-9810Google Scholar), whereas transient activation by epidermal growth factor did not cause nuclear translocation. Transient activation, therefore, has different consequences for gene expression, compared to sustained activation, since nuclear accumulation of active MAP kinases would result in phosphorylation of distinct substrates, which may subsequently modulate the activity of transcription factors. Thus, the quantitative difference in MAP kinase activation is translated into a qualitative difference in end responses. It remains to be determined if stimulation of cells with AII causes differential translocation or compartmentalization of MAP kinase activity to bring about the inhibitory effect on IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation. The intermediate in the MAP kinase pathway responsible for AII- and PMA-mediated inhibitory actions may be either MAPKK1, MAP kinase, or a downstream kinase activated by MAP kinase. This in turn may activate a kinase or a phosphatase, which could directly alter the signal transducing components of IL-6, through protein modifications. The interference may occur at the level of the IL-6 receptor (gp80) or the dimerization of the signal transducer protein gp130 during IL-6 signaling. Inhibition is unlikely to occur at the level of the JAK kinases, since AII treatment alone was shown to cause rapid activation of two of the JAK kinase family members, JAK2 and tyk2 (14Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, inhibition does not appear to be due to Stat3 protein degradation. An interesting possibility would involve a tyrosine phosphatase that would dephosphorylate tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3. In support of this, we have observed that inhibition of IL-6-induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation occurs even if AII is added for 25 min after stimulation with IL-6, 2G. J. Bhat and K. M. Baker, unpublished results. suggesting an active dephosphorylation event. Although this possibility requires further elucidation, our data point to a potent cross-regulation of cytokine responses by the angiotensin AT1A receptor, through the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Angiotensin II dose-dependently inhibited the IL-6-induced Stat3/SIF-A response with 50% inhibition occurring at 1 nM and complete inhibition at concentrations greater than 5 nM. These data indicate that AII mediates activation of a potent inhibitory pathway. In experiments where the ability of PD98059 to attenuate the inhibitory effects of AII was determined (Fig. 3), we used 1 nM AII to inhibit the IL-6-induced responses, since PD98059 (20 µM) completely blocked AII-induced MAP kinase activation at this concentration (Fig. 1C). The inability of PD98059 to completely inhibit the MAP kinase activation caused by AII at a concentration of 5 nM or greater, is consistent with a previous report (32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar), demonstrating that this inhibitor did not completely block the in vivo activation of MAP kinase, when cells were stimulated with high concentrations of agonists that were potent activators of MAPKK. Therefore, an effect of PD98059 on some biological processes could only be demonstrated at low concentrations of agonist (32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar). It is important to reiterate the high degree of specificity of the MAPKK1 inhibitor PD98059 used in the present investigation. PD98059 binds to the dephosphorylated form (inactive form) of MAPKK1 and thus prevents the activation and phosphorylation of MAPKK1 (IC50, 2 µM) (32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar). Only at higher concentrations does it exhibit a partial inhibitory effect on MAPKK2 (IC50, 50 µM) (32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar). It has been used effectively to block the in vivo activation of MAP kinase activity, induced by a variety of agents including platelet-derived growth factor (33Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar), NGF (34Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Google Scholar), and insulin (35Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Google Scholar). The high degree of specificity of PD98059 in vitro and in vivo is supported by its failure to inhibit a variety of protein kinases (18 protein Ser/Thr kinases and 4 protein Tyr kinases) that have so far been studied (32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar, 33Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar). Moreover, it does not prevent the in vivo activation of Raf or the activation of other MAPKK and MAP kinase homologues, such as c-JUN kinase or p38 (32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis has indicated that PD98059 does not compete for ATP binding or MAP kinase binding to MAPKK1, suggesting that it most likely inhibits MAPKK1 through an allosteric mechanism (33Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar). 3A. R. Saltiel, personal communication. This unusual mode of action may account for its high degree of selectivity for MAPKK1 inhibition (32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Google Scholar, 33Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar). The cross-talk between AII and IL-6 or related cytokines may be important in acute phase and inflammatory responses and other pathophysiological processes such as cardiac hypertrophy. IL-6 has been shown to have a significant role in the acute phase response (37Castell J.V. Andus T. Kunz D. Heinrich P.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 557: 87-101Google Scholar, 38Kushner I. Ganapathi M. Schultz D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 557: 19-30Google Scholar), and additionally, several IL-6 family members (leukemia inhibitory factor, IL-11, oncostatin M, and cardiotrophin-1) contribute to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (39Pennica D. King K.L. Shaw K.J. Luis E. Rullamas J. Luoh S.-M. Darbonne W.C. Knutzon D.S. Yen R. Chien K.R. Baker J.B. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1142-1146Google Scholar). It is possible that through differential activation of the MAP kinase pathway, AII may influence the status of Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation, thus modulating the cytokine signaling pathway and gene expression.

Astrocytes, the major glial cells in the CNS, do not constitutively express TNF-α, but the TNF-α gene is transcriptionally activated in response to a variety of stimuli, including TNF-α itself. Because of the importance of TNF-α in the CNS, we examined the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of the TNF-α gene in astrocytes. In transient transfection assays, a plasmid construct containing 1.3 kilobase pairs (kb) of 5′ flanking sequence of the rat TNF-α gene showed high basal activity that could not be further enhanced by TNF-α stimulation. A “marked” 10-kb TNF-α gene construct, which contains the whole TNF-β gene with 1.2 kb of 5′ flanking sequence, 1.1 kb of intergenic sequence, and the whole TNF-α gene with 3 kb of 3′ flanking sequence, was able to respond to TNF-α stimulation. Analysis of a series of 5′ and 3′ deletion constructs of the marked TNF-α genes demonstrated that upstream sequence elements such as NF-κB are not required for TNF-α induction and that TNF-α responsive elements are located in the 3′ flanking region of the TNF-α gene. We also found that a TNF-α-inducible DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) site is present in this 3′ region whose deletion abolishes TNF-α inducibility of the marked TNF-α gene. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays showed that TNF-α-inducible nuclear proteins, consisting of p50 and p65 NF-κB proteins, specifically bind to two consecutive NF-κB binding sites within the 3′ DH site. These results indicate that TNF-α-induced TNF-α gene expression in astrocytes involves p50 and p65 NF-κB proteins binding to downstream NF-κB sites and concomitant modulation of the chromatin structure.

These results indicate that TNF-α-induced TNF-α gene expression in astrocytes involves p50 and p65 NF-κB proteins binding to downstream NF-κB sites and concomitant modulation of the chromatin structure.

TNF-α contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis by promoting infiltration of inflammatory cells into the CNS, intracerebral immune responses, cytokine production, astrogliosis, and demyelination (for review see Ref. 1Benveniste E.N. Aggarawal B. Puri R. Human Cytokines: Their Role in Research and Therapy. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Boston1995: 195Google Scholar). Astrocytes, the major glial cells in the CNS, are capable of producing TNF-α upon exposure to multiple stimuli (2Chung I.Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2999-3007Google Scholar, 3Lieberman A.P. Pitha P.M. Shin H.S. Shin M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6348-6352Google Scholar, 4Robbins D.S. Shirazi Y. Drysdale B.-E. Lieberman A. Shin H.S. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 2593-2597Google Scholar) and thus can serve as an endogenous source of TNF-α within the CNS. We have previously shown that rat astrocytes are capable of producing TNF-α at both the mRNA and protein levels in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TNF-α (2Chung I.Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2999-3007Google Scholar, 5Benveniste E.N. Kwon J.B. Chung W.J. Sampson J. Pandya K. Tang L.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5210-5221Google Scholar). TNF-α is not constitutively expressed in astrocytes; however, the TNF-α gene is transcriptionally activated upon exposure to these stimuli (5Benveniste E.N. Kwon J.B. Chung W.J. Sampson J. Pandya K. Tang L.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5210-5221Google Scholar, 6Chung I.Y. Kwon J. Benveniste E.N. J.

Most of the previous studies on transcriptional regulation of the TNF-α gene have focused on the promoter regions of the mouse and human TNF-α genes. Thus far, however, results have not been conclusive regarding the cis-acting elements and transcription factors involved in TNF-α gene expression. The role of the transcription factor NF-κB in the regulation of TNF-α gene expression is controversial. NF-κB is essential for LPS induction of the mouse TNF-α promoter in mouse macrophages (7Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Google Scholar, 8Shakhov A.N. Collart M.A. Vassalli P. Nedospasov S.A. Jongeneel C.V. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 35-47Google Scholar), whereas the three κB sites in the human TNF-α promoter are neither required nor sufficient for virus or LPS induction of the TNF-α gene in mouse monocytic cell lines (9Goldfeld A.E. Doyle C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9769-9773Google Scholar). Phorbol ester (PMA) activation of the human TNF-α promoter in the U937 macrophage cell line appears to be mediated by the transcription factor AP-1 (10Economou J.S. Rhoades K. Essner R. McBride W.H. Gasson J.C. Morton D.L. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 321-326Google Scholar, 11Rhoades K.L. Golub S.H. Economou J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22102-22107Google Scholar). Analysis of the upstream region of the human TNF-α gene in U937 cells showed that the sequence of -95 from the transcription start site (TSS) is sufficient for PMA induction and that AP-1 plays an important role in both basal and PMA-induced activity of the human TNF-α promoter (10Economou J.S. Rhoades K. Essner R. McBride W.H. Gasson J.C. Morton D.L. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 321-326Google Scholar, 11Rhoades K.L. Golub S.H. Economou J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22102-22107Google Scholar). In contrast, Leitman et al. (12Leitman D.C. Mackow E.R. Williams T. Baxter J.D. West B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1352-1356Google Scholar) demonstrated that the proximal human TNF-α promoter containing only 28 nt upstream and 10 nt downstream of the TSS is sufficient for PMA induction in U937 cells; no other upstream sequences were required, and the TATA box structure was important. The minimum region of the human TNF-α promoter required for PMA activation in T and B cells has been localized between -52 and +89 with respect to the TSS, which is different from that in macrophages (13Goldfeld A.E. Strominger J.L. Doyle C. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 73-81Google Scholar). The TNF-α promoter also can be activated by TNF-α itself, which appears to be mediated by a palindrome sequence present between -125 and -82 that resembles the consensus binding sequences for AP-1, CREB, and ATF (14Leitman D.C. Ribeiro R.C.J. Mackow E.R. Baxter J.D. West B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9343-9346Google Scholar). In addition to NF-κB and AP-1, other transcription factors such as NFAT (15Goldfeld A.E. McCaffrey P.G. Strominger J.L. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1365-1379Google Scholar), Egr-1 (16Krämer B. Meichle A. Hensel G. Charnay P. Krünke M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 413-421Google Scholar), C/EBPβ (17Pope R.M. Leutz A. Ness S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1449-1455Google Scholar), and Ets (18Krämer B. Wiegmann K. Krünke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6577-6583Google Scholar) also appear to be involved in TNF-α gene expression. Furthermore, an involvement of downstream sequences in the TNF-α gene has been suggested (19Keffer J. Probert L. Cazlaris H. Georgopoulos S. Kaslaris E. Kioussis D. Kollias G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4025-4031Google Scholar, 20Kuprash D.V. Udalova I.A. Turetskaya R.L. Rice N.R. Nedospasov S.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 97-106Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that the cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors involved in TNF-α gene expression are diverse and that the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional activation of the TNF-α gene are species-, tissue-, and stimuli-specific. Because of the biological importance of TNF-α in the CNS, we have been studying how this gene is regulated in astrocytes. Using a series of marked rat TNF-α constructs, we have determined that upstream sequence elements such as the NF-κB sites are not required for TNF-α induction of the TNF-α gene and that the TNF-α responsive elements are present in the 3′ flanking region of the TNF-α gene. We have also found that a TNF-α-inducible DH site is present in the 3′ flanking region whose deletion abolishes TNF-α inducibility of the marked TNF-α gene. We then identified TNF-α-inducible nuclear proteins consisting of the p50 and p65 members of the NF-κB family that specifically bind to the NF-κB sites within the 3′ DH site. These data suggest an involvement of 3′κB sites and modulation of the chromatin structure in TNF-α gene expression in astrocytes. These findings collectively indicate that regulation of TNF-α gene expression in astrocytes differs from that previously described for monocytes, T-cells, and B-cells, suggesting cell type-specific mechanisms for control of this important cytokine. Primary glial cell cultures were established from neonatal rat cerebra as described previously (2Chung I.Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2999-3007Google Scholar). Meninges were removed from rat brains prior to glial cell dissociation and culture. Culture medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, high glucose formula supplemented with glucose to a final concentration of 6 g/liter, 2 mM glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acid mixture, 0.1% gentamycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). After 14 days in primary culture, oligodendrocytes were separated from the glial cultures by mechanical dislodging, and astrocytes were obtained by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA). Astrocytes were monitored for purity by immunofluorescence and by nonspecific esterase staining for contaminating microglia. Astrocyte cultures were routinely >97% positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, an intracellular antigen unique to astrocytes (21Bignami A. Eng L.F. Dahl D. Uyeda C.T. Brain Res. 1972; 43: 429-435Google Scholar), and less than 2% of the cells were microglia based on their positive staining for nonspecific esterase. All the TNF constructs originated from the plasmids pRTX, pRTSI, or pRTSII (22Kwon J.B. Chung I.Y. Benveniste E.N. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 227-236Google Scholar). The restriction enzyme sites used for plasmid constructions are indicated on the map of the TNF locus (Fig. 2A). A 1359-bp AvaI fragment of intergenic sequence was blunt-end ligated with the pBLCAT3 vector (23Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar) that was linearized with BglII to generate either pTNF(+1229)CAT or pTNF(-1229)CAT. 5′ deletion constructs were generated by exonuclease III digestion of pTNF(-1229)CAT digested with SphI and BamHI. Deletion points were determined by dideoxy chain-termination sequencing (USB). pTNF6.5 was constructed by sequential subcloning of the 2.3-kb EcoRI-SacI and the 4.2-kb SacI fragments of the TNF-α gene into EcoRI and SacI sites of pGEM3z. pTNF10 was constructed as follows; two SacI sites of pTNF6.5 were destroyed by two steps of cutting, removing protruding ends, and religating. A 4.9-kb HindIII-SalI (SalI is in the vector) fragment (3′-half of the TNF locus) was ligated with a 2.8-kb HindIII-SalI fragment of pGL2-Basic vector (Promega). The resulting plasmid was cut with SacI and XhoI and ligated with a 5.3-kb SacI-XhoI fragment (5′-half of the TNF locus) to generate pTNF10. A series of marked TNF-α gene deletion constructs were made as follows; a 2.1-kb SalI-XhoI fragment was cloned into the same sites of pGL2-Basic vector to make the BspEI site in the 5′-untranslated region of the TNF-α gene unique. An 8-bp synthetic NotI linker (GCGGCCGC, New England Biolabs) was inserted to the BspEI site that had been cut and blunt-ended, which resulted in an extra 12-bp (CCGGGCGGCCGC) introduced to the wild type sequence. The 1.1-kb SacII-XhoI fragment containing the NotI linker sequence was substituted for the same site fragment of pTNF6.5 to generate pTNF6.5*. pTNF10* was generated by substitution of a 5.6-kb SacII-BspEI (BspEI is in the 3′ flanking region of the TNF-α gene) fragment of pTNF6.5* for the same sequence of pTNF10. pTNF5.9* was generated by cloning the SacII (blunt-ended)-SalI (in the vector) fragment into the SmaI-SalI sites of pGEM3z. The 3′ deletion constructs of the marked TNF-α gene were generated by utilizing the unique restriction enzyme sites in the 3′ flanking region of the TNF-α gene that were also present in the vector. pTNF4.4*, -3.6*, -3.4*, and -2.7* were generated by deletions from pTNF5.9* of XbaI, SphI, SmaI, and PstI fragments, respectively. The SacII (blunt-ended)-EcoRI fragment was cloned into SmaI-EcoRI sites of pGEM3z to generate pTNF2.9*. pGL2-Control vector used as the internal control was purchased from Promega. The template plasmid for the TNF-α antisense RNA probe was prepared as follows. The sequence from -70 to +400 of gene pTNF6.5* (see Fig. 2C) was amplified by PCR. The primers were designed such that EcoRI and BamHI sites were generated at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the PCR product, respectively. The upstream primer was AGTTTTCCGCGAATTCGGGTTGAATGAGAGCTTTTC and the downstream primer was CCTTTCTTGCGGATCCCCTCCCACCCTACTTTGCTT. After digestion with EcoRI and BamHI, the 482-bp PCR product was cloned into pGEM4z to generate pTNF5′*. The plasmid for luciferase antisense RNA probe, pLUC5′*, was prepared in the same way. The sequence from 121 to 439 (sequence number according to manufacturer) of pGL2-Control was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEM4z (see Fig. 2C). The upstream primer was CCATTCTCCGAATTCGCCCCATGGCTGACTAAT and the downstream primer was CGGACATTTGGATCCCGAAGTATTCCGCGTACG. Transient transfection of primary rat astrocytes was performed by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser as described previously (24Panek R.B. Moses H. Ting J.P.-Y. Benveniste E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11518-11522Google Scholar). Astrocyte cultures were trypsinized, 7-10 × 106 cells resuspended in 250-400 µl of complete culture medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, mixed with 1-20 µg of plasmid DNA (CsCl, purified two times) with the same molar ratios, incubated for at least 10 min on ice, and then pulsed at 250 V and 960 microfarads. Cells transfected with the same plasmids were pooled, replated in 100-mm dishes with 10 ml of culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and allowed to recover for 24-48 h. Transfected astrocytes were stimulated with either medium alone or rat recombinant TNF-α (Biosource Int., Camarillo, CA) (500 units/ml) for 18 h for the CAT assay or 2 h for RNA analysis. The CAT assay was done with the xylene extraction method as described previously (24Panek R.B. Moses H. Ting J.P.-Y. Benveniste E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11518-11522Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated using the guanidinium method as described previously (6Chung I.Y. Kwon J. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3894-3902Google Scholar). The antisense RNA probes were generated with an in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) as described previously (6Chung I.Y. Kwon J. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3894-3902Google Scholar). pTNF5′* or pLUC5′* linearized with EcoRI was used as template DNA for TNF or luciferase antisense RNA probes, respectively. RNase protection assay (RPA) was performed with the RPA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion) as described previously (6Chung I.Y. Kwon J. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3894-3902Google Scholar). 90 µg of total cellular RNA were hybridized overnight at 43-45°C with TNF-α (2-5 × 105 cpm) and luciferase (2-5 × 105 cpm) probes in 20 µl of hybridization buffer containing 40 mM PIPES, 80% deionized formamide, and 400 mM sodium acetate. The hybridization reaction was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the presence of 5 µg/ml RNase A and 50 units/ml RNase T1. RNA protected from RNase digestion was precipitated and subjected to electrophoresis (5% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel) after heating at 90-95°C for 3-4 min. Quantitation of the protected RNA fragments was performed by scanning the gel with the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Mountain View, CA). Astrocytes were stimulated with medium alone or TNF-α (500 units/ml) for 20 min, harvested on ice after washing with cold PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2, incubated on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 1400 × g at 4°C for 4 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, incubated on ice for at least 10 min, and homogenized by 20 strokes with a type B pestle and 10 strokes with a type A pestle. Nuclei were purified through hypotonic buffer containing 8.5% (w/v) sucrose by centrifugation at 1500 × g at 4°C for 10 min. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of digestion buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2 and stored on ice until DNase I digestion. The concentration of the nuclei was adjusted to 4-5 × 107 nuclei/ml. 100-µl aliquots of the nuclei were incubated either in the absence or presence of varying amounts of DNase I (0.05-2.5 µg/100 µl, Sigma, DN-EP) at 37°C for 5 min. 100 µl of stop solution containing 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, and 200 µg/ml proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim) was added and then incubated overnight at 37°C. 0.2 volume of 10 M ammonium acetate was added after phenol/chloroform extraction, and DNA was precipitated by adding 2 volumes of ethanol, followed by centrifugation at 6000 × g (~8500 cpm for Eppendorf microcentrifuge), and washed two times with 70% ethanol. DNA was dissolved in TE buffer and subjected to restriction enzyme digestion. RNase A (25 µg/ml) was added and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, and DNA was purified by a standard procedure of phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA was run on a 1% agarose gel (<1 V/cm, for 16-20 h), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized with labeled probes by standard methods. Nuclear extracts were prepared from astrocytes as described previously (24Panek R.B. Moses H. Ting J.P.-Y. Benveniste E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11518-11522Google Scholar). Briefly, astrocytes were incubated with medium alone or TNF-α (500 units/ml) for the indicated times, harvested by scraping after washing with cold PBS, and pelleted. Cells (~5 × 107) were then resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5 mM PMSF), incubated on ice for 10 min, and pelleted at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of the hypotonic buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, incubated on ice for 20 min, and then homogenized with 20 strokes using a type B pestle in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted at 40,000 × g for 30 min, resuspended, and homogenized in 1 ml of high salt buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 M NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM PMSF), and shaken for 30 min at 4°C. Nuclei were then pelleted at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and protein extracts were dialyzed against a large volume of dialysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM PMSF). EMSA was performed in a volume of 20 µl containing 150 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.25 mM DTT, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 µg of polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidyl acid, 1 µg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 8-10 µg of nuclear extract, and 10,000-20,000 cpm 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe and incubated on ice for 30 min. Bound and free DNA were then resolved by electrophoresis through a 6% high ionic strength polyacrylamide gel (1 × TGE (Tris/glycine/EDTA) buffer) containing 5% glycerol at 250 V for 1 h. For competition assays, unlabeled probes were incubated with nuclear extracts on ice for 10 min followed by addition of labeled probes. For supershift assays, antibodies were incubated with the nuclear extracts for 15 min, followed by the addition of labeled probe. All the antisera against NF-κB subfamilies (p65, p50, p52, RelB, and c-Rel) were the generous gift of Dr. Nancy Rice (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD) (25Rice N.R. Ernst M.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4685-4695Google Scholar, 26Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Google Scholar). We have previously shown that rat astrocytes are capable of producing TNF-α at both the mRNA and protein levels in response to LPS (2Chung I.Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2999-3007Google Scholar). The TNF-α gene is not constitutively expressed in astrocytes; however, upon stimulation with LPS, TNF-α mRNA and protein are transiently expressed. Steady state levels of TNF-α mRNA are rapidly (15 min) detected after stimulation, are maximal at 2 h, and then decline (6Chung I.Y. Kwon J. Benveniste E.N. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3894-3902Google Scholar). It has been shown that TNF-α induces its own expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in HL-60 cells (27Hensel G. Mannel D.N. Pfizenmaier K. Kronke M. Lymphokine Res. 1987; 6: 119-125Google Scholar). Here, we show that the TNF-α gene can be induced by TNF-α in astrocytes. As shown in Fig. 1, TNF-α mRNA is not expressed in unstimulated cells (lane 1) and can be induced by TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 2-4). Further TNF-α dose-response experiments revealed that 500 units/ml TNF-α induced optimal TNF-α mRNA expression (data not shown); thus, this concentration was used for the remainder of the studies. To identify cis-acting regulatory element(s) required for TNF-α induction of the TNF-α gene, we made a series of constructs in which serially deleted upstream regions of the rat TNF-α gene were fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Astrocytes were transiently transfected with those constructs and stimulated with medium alone or TNF-α for 18 h, and then CAT activity was measured. Table I summarizes the results of the transfections. The full-length promoter construct, pTNF(-1229)CAT, which contains the sequence from -1229 to +130 with respect to the transcription start site (TSS) of the rat TNF-α gene (the AvaI fragment, see Fig. 2A), was not responsive to TNF-α stimulation, and a high basal level of CAT activity was detected in the absence of stimulation. The rat TNF-α gene has five κB-related sites in its upstream region. The high basal activity was not affected by deletion to -235 bp, which eliminated four NF-κB binding sites. Further deletion to -177, which removed the most proximal NF-κB binding site, resulted in approximately a 3-fold decrease in basal activity compared with the full-length promoter. However, none of the deletion constructs responded to TNF-α stimulation. These data indicate that the 1359-bp upstream region of the rat TNF-α gene is not sufficient for TNF-α-mediated activation of the TNF-α promoter.TABLE IPrimary rat astrocytes transfected with rat TNF-α promoter deletion constructs The results described above led us to examine the 10-kb rat TNF locus with respect to potential TNF-α responsive sequence(s). We prepared a series of “marked” TNF-α genes in which a mutation was introduced to allow discrimination of those mutated genes from the endogenous wild type TNF-α gene (Fig. 2, A and B). The marked gene has an 8-bp synthetic NotI linker that is inserted to the BspEI site in the 5′-untranslated region of the TNF-α gene (Fig. 2C). An antisense RNA probe was generated such that it is complementary to the sequence of -70 to +400 of the marked TNF-α gene containing the inserted NotI linker. In the RNase protection assay (RPA), this probe protects 359 nt of mRNA that are accurately initiated from the marked TNF-α gene promoter, whereas endogenous TNF-α mRNA is protected as two smaller fragments, 150 and 196 nt (Fig. 2C). This system also allows differentiation of authentic marked TNF-α mRNA from nonspecific transcripts such as readthrough transcripts. pGL2-Control, in which the SV40 promoter drives luciferase gene expression, was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency and RNA integrity. Similarly, the antisense RNA probe for the luciferase gene was generated such that the luciferase mRNA accurately initiated from the SV40 promoter was protected as ~250-nt fragments (Fig. 2C). Thus, it is possible to detect message from three genes in the same RPA gel; the transfected marked TNF-α gene, the transfected luciferase gene, and the endogenous TNF-α gene (see Fig. 2D). A number of preliminary control experiments of transient transfections with pTNF10* and/or vector plasmid showed that the 359-nt message is specifically transcribed from the promoter of the transfected TNF-α gene, that neither the vector nor the co-transfected pGL2-Control affect the regulation of the transfected TNF-α gene, and that the endogenous TNF-α gene was accurately regulated (data not shown). To localize the TNF-α responsive sequence(s), we analyzed a series of 5′ and 3′ deletion constructs of the marked TNF-α genes (Fig. 2B) in transient transfection assays. The results are shown in Fig. 2D. The full-length construct, pTNF10*, which contains the entire TNF-β gene with 1.2 kb of 5′ flanking sequence, the 1.1-kb intergenic space, and the entire TNF-α gene with 3 kb of 3′ flanking sequence, showed basal activity and was able to respond to TNF-α with ~6-fold induction. Two 5′ deletion constructs, pTNF6.5* and pTNF5.9*, were also capable of responding to TNF-α with ~5-fold induction, similar to what was observed with pTNF10*. pTNF6.5* (5′ deletion at -634), lacking the TNF-β gene, retains three NF-κB sites in the TNF-α promoter region. pTNF5.9* (5′ deletion at -70) contains in the promoter region an Sp-1 binding site, an AP-2 binding site, and the TATA box (Fig. 2, A and B). These results indicate that, for TNF-α induction of the TNF-α gene, the κB sites of the upstream region are not necessary, and the sequence of -70 is sufficient in the presence of downstream sequences. Deletion points of the 3′ deletion constructs, pTNF4.4*, pTNF3.6*, pTNF3.4*, pTNF2.9*, and pTNF2.7* are ~1.9 and ~1.1 kb, 746, 240, and 56 bp downstream of the polyadenylation signal sequence of the TNF-α gene, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). As shown in Fig. 2D, the constructs with deletions up to 746 bp (pTNF4.4*, pTNF3.6*, and pTNF3.4*) are capable of responding to TNF-α. The more extensive deletion constructs, pTNF2.9* or pTNF2.7*, do not respond to TNF-α stimulation. As in the 5′ deletion constructs, basal levels of marked TNF-α mRNA were detected in all the 3′ deletion constructs. None of the deletions up to pTNF3.4* significantly affected the magnitude of TNF-α induction (~4-6-fold) of marked TNF-α gene expression, indicating that no other important regulatory sequences are present in regions outside of TNF3.4*. Endogenous TNF-α gene expression was accurately regulated in all the transfections (~15-fold induction), indicating that abolishment of TNF-α inducibility of pTNF2.9* or pTNF2.7* is specifically due to deletions of the sequences rather than possible impairment in the TNF-α-mediated signaling pathway leading to activation of the TNF-α gene. These data demonstrate that the 500-bp downstream region of the TNF-α gene, i.e. the sequence between the EcoRI and SmaI sites (Fig. 2A), is critical for TNF-α induction of the TNF-α gene in astrocytes. We examined the chromatin structure of the endogenous TNF-α gene by looking at DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) sites, which are known, in essen"
https://openalex.org/W2038185016,"TAT protein is an essential regulatory protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Inhibition of TAT activity blocks the virus cycle, and a drug that blocks TAT is one of the possibilities to cure AIDS. Circular dichroism (CD) was measured for TAT peptides covering the TAT sequence with overlaps. The CD spectrum of each peptide was measured in different solvents to evaluate the ability of each TAT region to form different secondary structures. The most variation or conformational heterogeneity is observed with the two regions adjacent to the TAT basic region. CD data show that the basic region can adopt an extended structure in a full TAT protein, which is not the case for the isolated peptide. TAT sequences from the different HIV-1 isolates were analyzed, and the results showed that the sequences could be gathered into six groups. Molecular modeling was done on the various isolates based on a TAT structure from two-dimensional NMR. After minimization and dynamic steps, the modeled three-dimensional structures were compared. The results showed structural variations of the TAT protein as a function of the HIV-1 isolates. These structural variations were mainly in the two regions adjacent to the basic region, confirming the conformational heterogeneity indicated by the CD measurements. Furthermore, Chou-Fasman analysis shows significant changes in propensities for each secondary structure only for regions III and V. This conformational heterogeneity should be essential for TAT activity and points out that regions III and V are a poor potential target to design a TAT ligand. We propose a target involving TAT structurally conserved regions, accessible whatever the size of the TAT C terminus."

This molecule contains four tandem external immunoglobulin-like domains (D1-D4), a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Through the use of molecular modeling techniques, peptide analogs of the CDR3-like region of the human CD4 molecule, analog hPGP, a cyclized peptide 13 amino acids long, was synthesized and tested for its ability to inhibit proliferation in human mixed lymphocyte reactions. A conservative amino acid substitution was made at position 5 (D → N) to increase its activity and designated hPGP(N). A series of alanine substitution peptides were synthesized based on the sequence of hPGP(N) to determine the importance of each residue to the peptide's function. The substitutions of amino acids in positions 3, 7, and 8 had essentially no effect on the inhibitory activity of hPGP(N), while substitutions of amino acids in positions 4 and 6 increased its inhibitory effect. Alanine substitutions of amino acids in positions 2, 5, and 9 dramatically decreased the inhibitory effect of analog hPGP(N).

We and others have previously suggested that physical approximation of the BCR and the CD19/CD21 complex may be advantageous in antigen-dependent B-cell activation (18van Noesel C.J.M.

To test the signaling consequences of this approximation, we have generated bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) that bind membrane IgM (mIgM) and CD19 simultaneously. The mAbs specific for µH chain (CLB-MH15), CD3 (CLB-T3.4/2A and CLB-T3.2), CD5 (CLB-T1/1), CD14 (CLB-mon/1), CD16 (CLB-gran/1), CD19 (CLB-CD19), CD22 (CLB-CD22), CD40 (CLB-CD40), CD45 (CLB-CD45) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (CLB-GM17F), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (CLB-GM17E), and horse anti-rabbit Ig (CLB-PK17E) antibodies were generated at the Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service (CLB). mAb specific for δH chain was obtained from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Rabbit CD19 antiserum was kindly provided by D. Fearon (Cambridge, UK). The phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin was from Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA). The phosphotyrosine mAb (RC20) and PY20 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Syk, HCP, and Grb2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant human IL-2 was kindly provided by Hoffman-La Roche (Nutley, NJ), recombinant IL-4 was purchased from Genzyme Co. (Cambridge, MA), and recombinant IL-10 was kindly provided by R. de Waal Malefyt, DNAX Research Institute (Palo Alto, CA). bsAbs were prepared according to a modified protocol as described by Vossebeld et al. (20Vossebeld P.J.M. Kessler J. Borne Kr, A.E.G. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10671-10679Google Scholar). Briefly, F(ab)2 fragments were prepared by digestion with 2% (w/w) pepsin at pH 3.7 (MH15), pH 4.7 (CD19), pH 4.5 (CD22), or pH 4.4 (CD45) for 16 h at 37°C, followed by protein-A affinity chromatography to remove free Fc fragments and intact antibodies. Fab′-SH fragments of CD19, CD22, or CD45 were prepared by reducing F(ab)2 fragments (2-3 mg/ml in PBS) with 15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 30°C. The reduced product was passed through a G-25 Sephadex column (PBS, pH 6.7, and 2 mM EDTA) to remove the 2-mercaptoethanol. After elution, the Fab′-SH fraction was incubated with the cross-linker BMH (1 mM for 1 h at 30°C; Pierce). The reaction mixture was concentrated to the initial volume in C30 Amicon microconcentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The concentrated reaction mixture was passed through a G-25 Sephadex column (PBS, pH 6.7, and 2 mM EDTA) to collect Fab′-SH and to remove unbound BMH. Fab′-SH fragments of MH15 were prepared as described above, and this fraction was immediately added to the Fab′-BMH fraction. The mixture was concentrated to one-third of its volume in C30 Amicon microconcentrators and incubated for 14 h at room temperature. To separate the conjugated heterodimers from the unconjugated parental fragments, the reaction mixture was passed through a fast protein liquid chromatography Superose 12 column equilibrated with PBS. Appropriate fractions were pooled and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. The fraction containing the heteroconjugates was taken for further characterization as bsAb. First, the fractions containing the bsAb were tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of the parental antibodies to Daudi B-cells. Therefore, cells were incubated with CD19, CD22, or CD45 bsAb (5 µg/ml) for 30 min at 4°C. After washing the cells were incubated for 30 min at 4°C with goat anti-mouse Ig-FITC or the respective parental biotinylated mAb (5 µg/ml). After another washing step, the latter samples were incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin. Finally, cell-associated fluorescence was measured in a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Second, it was tested whether both binding sites were present in the bsAb. For this purpose a previously described mIgM- Daudi variant was used (21Lankester A.C. van Noesel C.J.M. van Schijndel G.M.W. van Lier R.A.W. Immunology. 1993; 80: 45-50Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with the CD19, CD22, or CD45 bsAb, respectively. Because of the absence of mIgM, binding of the bsAb could only be mediated via the anti-CD19, anti-CD22, or anti-CD45 component of the bsAb. After washing, the cells were incubated with human serum as a source of soluble human IgM. After another washing step, the IgM bound to the anti-IgM part of the bsAbs was detected with FITC-conjugated MH15 mAb. The Burkitt lymphoma cell line Daudi and the previously described mIgM- Daudi variant (21Lankester A.C. van Noesel C.J.M. van Schijndel G.M.W. van Lier R.A.W. Immunology. 1993; 80: 45-50Google Scholar) were routinely cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Tonsillar B-cells were isolated from tonsils of healthy donors. For purification of B-cells peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated with saturating amounts of CD3 (CLB-T3.4/2A), CD14, and CD16 mAbs. After washing, the cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse Ig-coated magnetic particles (Dynabeads-M450, Dynal A.S., Oslo, Norway), and cell-coated beads were removed by magnetic separation. Immunophenotypical analysis indicated that the purity of the final cell populations was >98%. Daudi cells were loaded with indo-1-AM (1 µmol/liter; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 60 min at 37°C in HEPES medium as described (22van Lier R.A.W. Bloemena E. Brouwer M. Van Heijst J. Weinreich S. Aarden L. Immunology. 1989; 67: 333-338Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with µF(ab)2 or bsAb, and ratios of 405/485 nm fluorescence per individual cell were calculated with the software Lysys (Becton Dickinson). Results were expressed as percentages of cells responding with a ratio above background level. Background levels were determined in resting cells and set at a level that included >95% of the cells. B-cells were activated, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed as recently described (23Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W. Van der Schoot C.E. van Oers M.H.J. van Noesel C.J.M. van Lier R.A.W. Blood. 1995; 86: 1090-1097Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation of the B-cells with any of the antibodies, the reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 immunoprecipitation buffer. Following the immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Hybond C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Corp.), and after blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin, the reactivity with specific antibodies was detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) to visualize the bound proteins. Autoradiography was performed with Kodak X-Omat S films. Purified tonsillar B-cells (5×104 cells/well) were cultured in 96-well round bottom plates (Greiner, Nurtingen, FRG) in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of various concentrations of µF(ab)2 or bsAbs combined with CD40 mAb (ascites 1:1000 dilution) and recombinant human IL-2 (50 units/ml), IL-4 (10 ng/ml), or IL-10 (100 units/ml), respectively. Proliferation was determined by a 16-h pulse with [3H]thymidine after 72 h of culture. Until now modulation of BCR signaling by CD19 has been studied using heteroconjugates of cross-linked bivalent antibodies. Carter et al. (10Carter R.H. Tuveson D.A. Park D.J. Rhee S.G. Fearon D.T. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3663-3671Google Scholar) demonstrated that these heteroconjugates induce both a synergistic activation of phospholipase Cγ and an increase in [Ca2+]i. We recently showed that co-ligation of CD19 with the cross-linked BCR enhanced the phosphorylation of SHC and the formation of multimeric SHC complexes (24Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W. Rood P.M.L. Verhoeven A.J. van Lier R.A.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2818-2825Google Scholar). 2A. C. Lankester, P. M. L. Rood, G. M. W. van Schijndel, B. Hooibrink, and R. A. W. van Lier, unpublished observations. In the case of T-cell-dependent antigens, the BCR is likely be ligated by an antigen (or antigenic fragment) with nonrepetitive epitopes that is opsonized by complement. Therefore, co-ligation of a single BCR with a single CD19 molecule would more closely reflect physiological B-cell triggering. To study the signaling consequences of this approximation of single receptor complexes, we choose to construct bispecific antibodies that ligate BCR and CD19 simultaneously. Binding efficiency and bispecificity of the distinct bsAb were analyzed. First, preincubation of Daudi cells with µF(ab)2 or any of the bsAbs was found to effectively inhibit the subsequent binding of the original bivalent mAbs (Table I). Second, to confirm the bispecificity of the individual bsAb, an mIgM- Daudi variant was stained with any of the three bsAbs. In this case, binding of the bsAb could only be mediated via the anti-CD19, CD22, or CD45 component of the bsAb. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with normal human serum to permit binding of serum IgM to the anti-IgM-specific part of the cell-bound bsAb. The bsAb-bound soluble IgM was detected with FITC-conjugated MH15, and indeed, all bsAb were found to be able to bind (soluble) IgM (Table I).TABLE ICharacterization of the bsAbsGAM-FITCCD19/PECD22/PECD45/PEMH15/PEPBS/MH15-FITCNHS/MH15-FITCC394115357829921621µF(ab)2975405NTNT561722CD19 bsAb8734554776315316159CD22 bsAb89242149NT13515142CD45 bsAb846409NT6712316297 Open table in a new tab To analyze the effect of bsAbs on mIg-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, Daudi B-cells were activated for 1 min with suboptimal amounts of µF(ab)2 (1 µg/ml; Fig. 1, lane C) or any of the bsAbs (lanes D-F). Subsequently, the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were recovered from the lysates with phosphotyrosine mAb, and analyzed in anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots. Several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins could be detected after activation with µF(ab)2 (Fig. 1, lane C). Although no tyrosine phosphorylation was detected following activation with µFab or CD19Fab (data not shown), stimulation with the CD19 bsAb resulted in a more pronounced tyrosine phosphorylation of most of these proteins and preferentially induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a 90-95 kDa protein. In contrast, in the B-cells activated with CD22 bsAb this protein was hardly detectable, but instead a prominent 135-140 kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was precipitated. Stimulation with the CD45 bsAb almost completely prevented the induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Based on their apparent molecular weight, their specific appearance, and the observation that both phosphoproteins resided in the membrane fraction of activated B-cells (data not shown), the 90-95-kDa and the 135-140-kDa phosphoproteins could represent CD19 and CD22, respectively. To investigate this possibility the CD19 protein was isolated by immunoprecipitation with CD19 Ab from B-cells that were activated with the distinct bsAbs and analyzed in anti-phosphotyrosine blots. Indeed, the 90-95-kDa CD19 protein was strongly and predominantly tyrosine-phosphorylated after activation with the CD19 bsAb (Fig. 2A). An indirect approach was taken for the identification of the major 135-140-kDa protein in CD22 bsAb-stimulated cells. It has been recently shown that in mIg-activated B-cells, tyrosine-phosphorylated CD22 specifically recruits the tyrosine phosphatase HCP (25Campbell M.A. Klinman N.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1573-1579Google Scholar, 26Doody G.M. Justement L.B. Delibrias C.C. Matthews R.J. Lin J. Thomas M.L. Fearon D.T. Science. 1995; 269: 242-244Google Scholar, 27Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W. van Lier R.A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20305-20308Google Scholar). Therefore, the amount of HCP-associated CD22 may directly reflect the tyrosine phosphorylation level of CD22. The HCP protein was isolated from bsAb-activated B-cells by immunoprecipitation with HCP Ab and subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine blotting. The tyrosine-phosphorylated 135-140-kDa protein representing CD22 was almost exclusively detected after stimulation with CD22 bsAb (Fig. 2B). Together, these findings show that intimate co-ligation of mIg and accessory molecules results in the phosphorylation of specific substrates. To investigate whether the potent induction of early B-cell activation events by CD19 bsAb could be translated in late events, the effect of these bsAbs on B-cell proliferation was analyzed. Purified tonsillar B-cells were stimulated with various concentrations of µF(ab)2 or any of the bsAb, in combination with CD40 mAb and IL-2 (Fig. 3). Whereas a strong proliferative response was induced with µF(ab)2, the CD19 bsAb were unable to induce B-cell proliferation. Similar results were obtained when IL-2 was replaced by either IL-4 or IL-10 (data not shown). The CD22 bsAb was found to be moderately agonistic at low concentrations, but this was converted to an inhibitory effect at the highest concentration. In accordance with its inability to activate protein-tyrosine kinases, no proliferative response was induced with CD45 bsAb. Similar results were obtained when purified peripheral blood B-cells were used (data not shown). Thus, the initial biochemical analyses and functional assays appeared to be contradictory. CD19 bsAb are excellent inducers of protein-tyrosine kinase activity, yet they fail to work as agonists for mitogenesis. To further analyze this apparent discrepancy we investigated the effect of CD19 bsAb on two signaling pathways that are known to be crucial for mitogenic activation: 1) Ca2+i mobilization and 2) the assembly of Grb2 complexes that may couple the BCR to p21ras. The mobilization of Ca2+i is one of the cellular activation events that is critically dependent on protein-tyrosine kinase activity (28Carter R.H. Park D.J. Rhee S.G. Fearon D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2745-2749Google Scholar, 29Lane P.J.L. Ledbetter J.A. McConnell F.M. Draves K. Deans J. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 715-722Google Scholar, 30Padeh S. Levitsky A. Gazit A. Mills G.B. Roifman C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1114-1118Google Scholar) and may lead to the transcriptional activation of early response genes (31Gold M.R. DeFranco A.L. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 221-295Google Scholar). To compare the efficiency of µF(ab)2 and CD19 bsAb to evoke Ca2+i mobilization, a titration experiment was performed. After stimulation of Daudi cells with µF(ab)2 (2.5 µg/ml), a rapid increase in Ca2+i, followed by a plateau phase was observed. The percentage of responding cells, both in the initial peak (Fig. 4) and the plateau phase (data not shown), were found to be modestly enhanced following activation with the CD19 bsAb. In contrast, both peak and plateau values were considerably lower in cells activated with CD22 bsAb (data not shown). Moreover, at lower concentrations, the percentage of responding cells was found to be clearly higher after stimulation with the CD19 bsAb. This suggests that CD19 co-ligation may amplify the mIg-induced signal(s) that is (are) responsible for the Ca2+i mobilization. Recently genetic evidence has been provided that activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of protein-tyrosine kinase syk is an indispensible step in the process of BCR-induced Ca2+i mobilization (32Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Google Scholar). In addition, we have found that the absence of mIg-induced Ca2+i mobilization and proliferation was correlated with lower levels of syk expression in particular B-CLL (23Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W. Van der Schoot C.E. van Oers M.H.J. van Noesel C.J.M. van Lier R.A.W. Blood. 1995; 86: 1090-1097Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed whether the aforementioned differences in Ca2+i mobilization are correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation status of syk. The measurements of mIg-induced Ca2+i mobilization indicated that the amplifying effect of CD19 co-ligation was particularly evident at lower levels of mIg occupancy. Interestingly, analysis of syk tyrosine phosphorylation after activation with decreasing concentrations of µF(ab)2 or CD19 bsAb revealed a similar pattern (Fig. 5). Already at a very low concentration (0.3 µg/ml), stimulation with the CD19 bsAb but not with the µF(ab)2 resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of syk and an associated 120-kDa protein (pp120). Only at optimal concentrations (5 µg/ml) a similar syk phosphorylation was induced by both stimuli, which appears to be in accordance with the comparable levels of Ca2+i mobilization. The CD19 bsAb-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of pp120 was found to be relatively reduced in the latter case. Similar effects were observed in tonsillar B-cells (data not shown). The identity of pp120 remains to be determined but was excluded to be phospholipase Cγ based on a distinct molecular mass and nonreactivity with specific antibodies (data not shown). However, based on the recently described association between the syk-related protein-tyrosine kinase ZAP70 and p120 c-cbl in T cells (33Fournel M. Davidson D. Weil R. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 301-306Google Scholar), pp120 may represent c-cbl assembling in syk complexes upon BCR cross-linking. Together, these findings indicate that intimate co-ligation of CD19 and mIg specifically lowers the threshold for mIg-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of syk and the subsequent Ca2+i mobilization. Recently, several groups have reported the mIg-induced assembly and membrane translocation of multimeric Shc-Grb2 complexes, which may couple the BCR to p21ras (24Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W. Rood P.M.L. Verhoeven A.J. van Lier R.A.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2818-2825Google Scholar, 34Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I. Bowtell D. Aebersold R. Gold M.R. J.

To investigate the possible influence of the CD19 bsAb on this process, we have analyzed the assembly of Grb2 complexes. Daudi cells were stimulated for distinct periods with suboptimal amounts of µF(ab)2 or CD19 bsAb. Subsequently, the Grb2 complexes were isolated and analyzed in anti-phosphotyrosine blots. After stimulation with µF(ab)2, the previously described 145-kDa phosphoprotein (pp145) and the 54-kDa form of Shc (p54) were detected within the Grb2 complex (Fig. 6, left panel) but were less profound than after cross-linking with biotinylated MH15 mAb (Fig. 6, right panel) (24Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W. Rood P.M.L. Verhoeven A.J. van Lier R.A.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2818-2825Google Scholar). Both pp145 phosphoprotein and p54 Shc also resided in the Grb2 complex after activation with CD19 bsAb, although the phosphorylation of pp145 was predominant. It has been previously shown that pp145 directly interacts with the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of Shc (36Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Google Scholar), and recent evidence suggests that pp145 is phosphorylated by protein-tyrosine kinase lyn (37Nagai K. Takata M. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6824-6829Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the predominance of pp145 in Grb2 complexes after stimulation with CD19 bsAb may thus reside in the CD19-associated lyn activity (6van Noesel C.J.M. Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W. van Lier R.A.W. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 699-705Google Scholar, 7Roifman C.M. Ke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 222-225Google Scholar, 8Uckun F.M. Burkhardt A.L. Jarvis L. Jun X. Stealey B. Dibirdik I. Myers D.E. Tuel-Ahlgren L. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21172-21184Google Scholar). Strikingly, an additional and very prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 90-95 kDa (pp90-95) was specifically detected under these conditions. This protein was hardly or not at all detectable after stimulation with µF(ab)2 or with cross-linked biotinylated MH-15 mAb (Fig. 6, right panel) and has not been previously described in Grb2 complexes (24Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W. Rood P.M.L. Verhoeven A.J. van Lier R.A.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2818-2825Google Scholar, 34Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I. Bowtell D. Aebersold R. Gold M.R. J.

A plausible candidate for pp90-95 might be tyrosine-phosphorylated CD19, because CD19 is predominantly phosphorylated after stimulation with CD19 bsAb (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2A). Moreover, several putative binding motifs for the Grb2 SH2 domain (amino acid code YXN) are present in the cytoplasmic tail of CD19. To analyze this possibility, CD19 and Grb2 proteins were immunoprecipitated from Daudi cells after stimulation with CD19 bsAb and analyzed in anti-phosphotyrosine blots (Fig. 7). The Grb2-associated pp90-95 co-migrated with tyrosine-phosphorylated CD19 and the finding that both phosphoproteins still co-migrated after N-glycanase treatment (data not shown) provide further support for their identity. Given the fact that pp90-95 was never detected in Shc immunoprecipitations (data not shown), it may be possible that CD19 can act as a putative competitor of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc for binding to Grb2. Interference with the generation of regular Grb2 complexes might explain the lack of mitogenic potential of these bispecific antibodies. Our data show that co-ligation of particular accessory molecules alters signaling via the BCR both in a qualitative and quantitative fashion. Thus, compared with the mitogenic µF(ab)2 fragments, CD19 bsAb were unable to induce proliferation. Detailed analysis of early signaling events revealed an intact and even enhanced Ca2+i mobilization but a qualitatively altered composition of Grb2 complexes. Expression of human CD19 in mice resulted in a severely impaired development of immature B-cells in the bone marrow and only limited numbers of peripheral B-cells (38Zhou L.J. Smith H.M. Waldenschmidt T.J. Schwarting R. Daley J. Tedder T.F. Mol Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 3884-3894Google Scholar). Whether this is caused by competition for a murine CD19 ligand or by interference with particular signals transmitted via the pre-BCR complex is currently unknown. With respect to the latter option interference with normal activation of the p21ras pathway seems possible in these animals. In contrast to the CD19 transgenic mice, a relatively normal development of conventional B-cells was observed in CD19 knock-out mice (39Rickert R.C. Rajewsky K. Roes J. Nature. 1995; 376: 352-355Google Scholar, 40Engel P. Zhou L.J. Ord D.C. Sato S. Koller B. Tedder T.F. Immunity. 1995; 3: 39-50Google Scholar). However, the B-1 B-cell subset was found to be largely reduced, probably by interference with the self-renewal capacity (41Krop I. de Fougerolles A.R. Hardy R.R. Allison M. Schlissel M.S. Fearon D.T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 238-242Google Scholar). Notably, the T-cell-dependent B-cell responses were severely impaired in these mice. Combining data on transgenic and knock-out mice suggest that CD19 is involved in setting a signaling threshold for mIg-dependent B-cell activation. Our current data suggest that threshold setting may differ for individual intracellular signaling pathways. Likewise, the consequences of BCR CD19 co-ligation in vivo may depend on the extracellular context in which the B-cell is activated, e.g. depending on the presence of T cells and follicular dendritic cells."

https://openalex.org/W1979692692,"The CEF-4/9E3 cytokine gene is expressed aberrantly in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) transformed by the Rous sarcoma virus. The expression of CEF-4 is dependent on both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms of regulation. The characterization of the promoter region indicated that three distinct regulatory elements corresponding to an AP-1 binding site (or TRE), a PRDII/κB domain, and a CAAT box are involved in the activation by pp60v-src. In this report we investigate the signaling pathways controlling the expression of the TRE and PRDII domain. The expression of a dominant negative mutant of p21ras reduced the activity of both elements. In contrast a similar mutant of c-Raf-1 affected modestly the activation dependent on the TRE but not PRDII. The stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway was important for the activity of PRDII and the TRE but was not markedly stimulated by pp60v-src. The addition of calphostin C and the inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) diminished the accumulation of the CEF-4 mRNA and reduced the activity of a TRE-controlled promoter. Likewise, the depletion of PKC by chronic treatment with phorbol esters inhibited the activation of the TRE. Rous sarcoma virus-transformed CEF treated with calphostin C were also flatter, did not display a high degree of criss-crossing, and appeared morphologically normal. Hence PKC was important for the activation of AP-1 and the morphological transformation of CEF. The constitutive expression of CEF-4 was correlated with transformation only when dependent on the TRE.

This was not true for PRDII, which was the only element required for the constitutive activation to the CEF-4 promoter in nontransformed cells treated chronically with phorbol esters. Much attention has been devoted to the study of genes expressed aberrantly in transformed cells. In some instances, a role in transformation has been defined for the protein encoded by these genes (Dehbi and Bádard, 8Dehbi M. Bádard P.-A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 980-997Google Scholar). In addition, transformation-regulated genes provide useful markers to investigate the signaling pathways activated by the oncoproteins. For instance, it has been shown that Ha-Ras is critical for the activation of the Egr-1 promoter and TIS10 gene (also known as Cox-2 and prostaglandin synthase) in v-src-transformed cells (Qureshi et al., 37Qureshi S.A. Alexandropoulos K. Rim M. Joseph C.K. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17635-17639Google Scholar; Xie et al., 55Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). Likewise the serine/threonine kinase c-Raf-1 is critical for the expression of Egr-1 but plays no role in the activation of TIS10 (Foster, 17Foster D.A. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 389-399Google Scholar). Therefore, multiple pathways linked to Ha-Ras have been implicated in transcriptional activation by pp60v-src. The nuclear targets of these oncoproteins are essential for gene expression and for the process of transformation itself. The expression of a dominant negative mutant of c-Jun blocks transformation by v-src and Ha-ras (Granger-Schnarr et al., 20Granger-Schnarr M. Benusiglio E. Schnarr M. Sassone-Corci P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4236-4239Google Scholar; Lloyd et al., 30Lloyd A. Yancheva N. Wasylyk B. Nature. 1991; 352: 635-638Google Scholar; Suzuki et al., 47Suzuki T. Murakami M. Onai N. Fukuda E. Hashimoto Y. Sonobe M. Kameda T. Ishinose M. Miki K. Iba H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3527-3535Google Scholar). Therefore, the oncogenic action of pp60v-src and p21ras is dependent on the activation of AP-1. Similar findings have been reported for the Ets family of transcription factors (Bruder et al., 5Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Google Scholar; Wasylyk et al., 49Wasylyk C. Maira S.-M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3665-3673Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, several components of the transduction pathways controlling the activity of AP-1 or Ets-like factors have oncogenic activity on their own. Moreover, the micro-injection of antibodies or the expression of a dominant negative mutant of Ha-Ras or c-Raf-1 abolish transformation by pp60v-src (Qureshi et al., 38Qureshi S.A. Joseph C.K. Hendrickson M. Song J. Gupta R. Bruder J. Rapp U. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 969-975Google Scholar; Smith et al., 43Smith M.R. Degudicibus S.J. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1986; 320: 540-543Google Scholar). Hence, a more coherent view of cell transformation has emerged from the combined study of signaling pathways and gene expression. Despite this recent progress, several aspects of cell transformation are poorly understood. The recent observation that a dominant negative mutant of Rac-1 or Rho-1 interferes with transformation by v-src or ras emphasizes the need to improve our knowledge of other members of this superfamily of small GTPases (Khosravi-Far et al., 23Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Google Scholar; Qiu et al., 36Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Google Scholar). The recent identification of JNK (SAPK) as a downstream effector of Rac-1 implies a role for the latter in the control of c-Jun activity (Foster, 17Foster D.A. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 389-399Google Scholar; Minden et al., 34Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar; Olson et al., 35Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Google Scholar). Since distinct functions such as intracellular localization, potential of trans-activation, DNA binding, dimerization, or expression can be regulated separately, it is likely that multiple transduction pathways cooperate in the activation of a single transcription factor. We have previously characterized the promoter of the v-src responsive CEF-4/9E3 cytokine gene in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) 1The abbreviations used are: CEFchicken embryo fibroblast(s)TPAtetradecanoyl phorbol acetatePKCprotein kinase CMEKKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinaseSRUv-src responsive unitCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseRSVRous sarcoma virusSAPKstress-activated protein kinaseJNKJun N-terminal kinaseSEKstress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase.

Three distinct promoter elements corresponding to an AP-1 binding site (or TPA responsive element, TRE) a PRDII/κB domain, and a CAAT box are necessary for maximal expression in CEF transformed by the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). Accordingly, this region of the promoter has been designated the v-src responsive unit (SRU) of the CEF-4 gene. In this report we characterize the transduction pathways involved in the activation of the TRE and PRDII domain of the promoter. Using minimal promoter constructs controlled by a single element, we show that the activated and dominant negative forms of Ras and the MEKK pathway regulate the activity of the PRDII and TRE binding factors. In contrast, a role for c-Raf-1 and protein kinase C (PKC) appears to be restricted to the activation of the TRE. Moreover, chronic TPA treatment had opposite effects on the activity of these elements. While the activation of a TRE-controlled promoter was reduced significantly by the prolonged treatment with phorbol esters, the activation of PRDII was not affected and was even superinduced in v-src transformed CEF. Further characterization confirmed that chronic TPA treatment results in the constitutive stimulation of PRDII and the CEF-4 promoter in CEF. Since CEF treated with TPA do not display a fully transformed phenotype, these results imply that constitutive activation through PRDII is not sufficient to cause transformation. The addition of calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of PKC, resulted in the down-modulation of the TRE activity and in the flattening or morphological reversion of RSV-transformed CEF. Hence, transformation was correlated with the activation of the TRE but not PRDII. chicken embryo fibroblast(s) tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate protein kinase C mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase v-src responsive unit chloramphenicol acetyltransferase Rous sarcoma virus stress-activated protein kinase Jun N-terminal kinase stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Early passages of CEF were grown at 41.5°C in Richter-improved minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated newborn bovine serum (Cansera, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada), 5% tryptose phosphate broth, L-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Unless indicated, all experiments were done with actively growing cells. CEF were infected with the wild type Schmidt-Ruppin A strain of the Rous sarcoma virus (SR-A RSV) or with the temperature-sensitive mutant ts NY72-4 RSV. Cells were treated with various concentrations of tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA, Sigma) or calphostin C (Calbiochem) as indicated in the text or with the equivalent concentration of the diluent in control samples (0.1% ethanol and 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively). A concentration of 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, was added routinely to the culture medium of transfected CEF to prevent excessive variations in pH. Constructs of the CEF-4 promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT gene) are depicted in Fig. 1 and have been described previously (Dehbi et al., 9Dehbi M. Mbiguino A. Beauchemin M. Chatelain G. Bádard P.-A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1490-1499Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid Spe/CAT includes nucleotides -214 to +36 of the 5′ flanking and transcribed region of the CEF-4 gene and contains an intact v-src-responsive unit (SRU). Plasmids µPRD/CAT and µTRE/CAT are equivalent constructs containing a mutation in the PRDII domain or the TPA-responsive element (TRE) of the CEF-4 SRU, respectively. The deletion of nucleotides -64 to -214 (deletion SpeI/NheI in plasmid S-N/CAT) in a larger fragment of the 5′ flanking region of CEF-4 (spanning nucleotides -1312 to +36) results in the deletion of the SRU and in an inactive promoter (Dehbi et al., 9Dehbi M. Mbiguino A. Beauchemin M. Chatelain G. Bádard P.-A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1490-1499Google Scholar). Constructs 4XPRD/CAT and 4XTRE/CAT consist of four copies of the PRDII domain or the TRE inserted in place of nucleotides -214 to -64 in plasmid S-N/CAT. Both constructs are v-src-responsive but are controlled by a single element of the SRU. Plasmids P3-CAT1/TATA and 3XTRE-CAT1/TATA were constructed by inserting three copies of the PRDII domain or the TRE in proximity of an heterologous minimal promoter. To this end, synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides for PRDII (5′-AGCTTCTGGGAAATTCCTG-3′) or the TRE (5′-AGCTTGTGACTCATTT-3′) were inserted in the SalI site of plasmid pJFCAT1/TATA that includes a TATAAAA box and the initiation start site of human β-globin gene. The minimal promoter of pJFCAT1/TATA has a weak basal activity that is not regulated by pp60v-src in CEF (Dehbi et al., 10Dehbi M. Beaulieu S. Cohen E.A. Bádard P.-A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2399-2403Google Scholar). Equivalent constructs containing a mutation in the PRDII domain or the TRE were also generated with plasmid pJFCAT1/TATA (data not shown). The plasmid expressing a dominant negative mutant of Ha-Ras pZIP M17 or M17RAS and the parental vector pZIPneo were a generous gift of Dr. G. Cooper (Feig and Cooper, 15Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Google Scholar). The dominant negative mutant of Ha-Ras was also expressed from the RSV long terminal repeat by subcloning the XbaI-PstI fragment of pZIPM17 in the HindIII site of plasmid pRSV by blunt end ligation. Likewise, a v-Ha-ras sequence was subcloned in plasmid pRSV by isolating the BamHI fragment of plasmid pJCS1 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Stone). The same results were obtained when the dominant negative or activated form of Ha-Ras was expressed in plasmid pRSV or in the original vectors described above. Plasmid Raf375W encodes a kinase-deficient, dominant negative mutant of c-Raf-1 under the control of the RSV long terminal repeat (Bruder et al., 5Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Google Scholar). An equivalent construct was also generated independently by inserting the dominant negative mutant of c-Raf-1 (kindly provided by Dr. S. Meloche) in plasmid pRSV. Plasmid BXB-Raf encodes a constitutively activated form of c-Raf-1 (Bruder et al., 5Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Google Scholar).

Plasmid pRSVβgal consists of the lacZ gene under the control of the RSV long terminal repeat (Edlund et al., 13Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Google Scholar). Normal CEF and CEF infected with the temperature-sensitive mutant NY72-4 RSV were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish 24 h prior to transfection. All transfections were done at the nonpermissive temperature of 41.5°C by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (Dehbi et al., 9Dehbi M. Mbiguino A. Beauchemin M. Chatelain G. Bádard P.-A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1490-1499Google Scholar). A total amount of 30 µg of DNA consisting of 2 or 10 µg of the reporter plasmid for NY72-4 RSV-infected CEF and normal CEF, respectively, 2 µg of the pRSVβgal internal control, 0.1-18 µg of effector plasmid (or parental vector, see the figure legends for the details of each transfection), and variable amounts of carrier salmon sperm DNA was transfected per 100-mm dish. Plasmid pRSVβgal was used to correct for transfection efficiency since it is not regulated by pp60v-src transformation (Dehbi et al., 9Dehbi M. Mbiguino A. Beauchemin M. Chatelain G. Bádard P.-A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1490-1499Google Scholar; Edlund et al., 13Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Google Scholar). Results obtained with equal amounts of total protein were also in close agreement with those based on equal levels of β-galactosidase activity. All combinations of plasmids were investigated in duplicate or triplicate samples in at least two separate experiments. The errors indicated on bar graphs represent the deviation from the means of duplicate or triplicate samples. Increasing concentrations of effector plasmid or the corresponding parental vector (0.1-18 µg per 100-mm dish) were investigated to obtain maximal inhibition or stimulation by the dominant negative or activated forms of Ras, Raf, SEK, or MEKK and to control for possible squelching effects of the plasmid. Transformation was induced by transferring NY72-4 RSV-infected CEF to the permissive temperature of 37°C for 24 h. Stimulation by phorbol esters was performed by a single addition of 800 nM TPA to the culture medium. NY72-4 RSV-infected CEF were transfected with plasmid pcDNA3-HA-SAPK46γ (5 µg/100-mm dish) in the presence or in the absence of a plasmid encoding SEK (5 µg) or MEKK (0.1 µg), or devoid of any insert (i.e. the parental vector pcDNA3). Two days later, a cell lysate was prepared from cells transferred to the permissive temperature for 24 h or maintained at the nonpermissive temperature for the duration of the experiment. When indicated cells were treated for 40 min with anisomycin (50 µg/ml) before lysis. Transfected CEF were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h in a lysis buffer consisting of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 3 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA, pH 7.6, 0.3 M NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM benzamidine, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 µg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin on ice. The epitope-tagged SAPK was immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysate with the 12C5A monoclonal antibody (incubated for 1 h on ice; Boehringer Mannheim) and recovered with protein A-agarose. The immune complex was washed extensively in a buffer consisting of 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, and then once in the kinase reaction buffer (20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 0.5 mM sodium fluoride, and 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.6). Kinase assays were performed at 30°C for 30 min in 30 µl of the kinase reaction buffer containing 20 µM ATP, 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1.5 µg of purified GST-c-Jun (amino acids 5-89) as a substrate. The reactions were terminated by boiling in an SDS sample buffer, and the products were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography. The phosphorylated GST-c-Jun proteins were quantitated in an Instant Imager (Packard). Total cell RNA was isolated by the high salt-urea precipitation method as described previously (Auffrey and Rougeon, 1Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Google Scholar; Bádard et al., 2Bádard P.-A. Alcorta D. Simmons D.L. Luk K.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6715-6719Google Scholar). An equal mass of total RNA (7.5 µg) was loaded per well and separated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. The RNA was then transferred on a NYTRAN membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with radiolabeled cDNAs for the various “CEF genes” or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Simmons et al., 42Simmons D.L. Levy D.B. Yannoni Y. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1178-1182Google Scholar). Radiolabeling was done by random priming (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 16Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar). Total proteins were isolated from CEF monolayers washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by boiling in an SDS-containing buffer (2.3% SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with commercially available antibodies against protein kinase Cα or -ϵ (number 10267-011, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) as described previously (Gonneville et al., 18Gonneville L. Martins T.J. Bádard P.-A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1825-1833Google Scholar). The immune complex was detected after incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and revealed with a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL system, Amersham Canada, Oakville, Ontario). The CEF-4 promoter is activated gradually in CEF transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of pp60v-src (Dehbi et al., 9Dehbi M. Mbiguino A. Beauchemin M. Chatelain G. Bádard P.-A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1490-1499Google Scholar). AP-1 and the PRDII binding protein accumulate with different kinetics in CEF infected with ts NY72-4 RSV. The level of AP-1 is nearly maximal within 6-12 h of activation of pp60v-src, whereas the PRDII binding protein continues to accumulate well beyond this interval. Thus, induction through the TRE and PRDII may occur at different times. To address this question constructs of the CEF-4 promoter containing four copies of the TRE or PRDII were transfected in NY 72-4 RSV-infected CEF, and the activity of the reporter gene was measured at different times after transfer to the permissive temperature. As shown in Fig. 2A, the activation of the TRE was maximum within 12 h of temperature shift while the activity of the PRDII controlled promoter continued to increase thereafter. The same conclusion was reached with constructs consisting of a heterologous promoter fused to multiple copies of the TRE or PRDII (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the TRE and PRDII domain were activated with different kinetics in RSV-transformed CEF. This observation suggests that pp60v-src acts on different signal transduction pathways to control the activity of AP-1 and the PRDII-binding factor. The Ras-Raf pathway is important in the transformation by v-src since the micro-injection of neutralizing antibodies or the expression of a dominant negative mutant of these proteins decrease the tumorigenicity and interfere with morphological transformation of v-src-transformed cells (Qureshi et al, 57Yoshida T. Suzuki T. Sato H. Nishina H. Iba H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2715-2721Google Scholar; Smith et al., 43Smith M.R. Degudicibus S.J. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1986; 320: 540-543Google Scholar). To examine the role of this pathway, minimal promoter constructs of the TRE and PRDII were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing a dominant negative mutant of Ha-Ras or c-Raf-1. The effect of the wild type or activated form of the proteins was investigated in parallel. Levels of the CAT enzyme were determined in cells maintained at the nonpermissive temperature of 41.5°C or transferred to 37°C for 24 h. The activity of the PRDII-controlled promoter was markedly reduced by the Ras dominant negative mutant in transformed CEF and to a lesser extent in CEF maintained at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 3B). Likewise the activity of the TRE-controlled promoter was inhibited by the dominant negative mutant at both temperatures (Fig. 3C). The expression of v-Ha-ras strongly stimulated the TRE but had a more modest effect on the PRDII-controlled promoter (Fig. 3A). This poor inducibility of PRDII was observed repeatedly in transient expression assays over a wide range of plasmid concentrations suggesting that at least in these experimental conditions Ha-Ras is not a potent inducer of PRDII. Since the dominant negative mutant interfered with activation by v-src, Ha-Ras may nevertheless interact with a component of the pathway controlling PRDII. A similar investigation was carried out for c-Raf-1. A reduction in the activity of the TRE was observed in cells expressing the dominant negative mutant (plasmid RAF375W in Fig. 3C). In all experiments, however, the inhibition never exceeded 35% of the total activity of the promoter. In contrast, the activation of PRDII was not affected by the co-transfection of plasmid RAF375W (Fig. 3B). The expression of the activated form of c-Raf-1 enhanced the activity of the TRE but did not stimulate the PRDII-controlled promoter, in agreement with the results obtained with the dominant negative mutant (Fig. 3A). In fact the activity of PRDII was consistently repressed by the activated form of the kinase. Therefore, we conclude that c-Raf-1 controls in part the activation of AP-1 but plays no inductive role in the pathway controlling PRDII in v-src-transformed CEF. The activity of c-Jun (and AP-1) is dependent on dephosphorylation of residues at the C terminus of the protein (controlling DNA binding) as well as phosphorylation and potentiation of the activation domain of the protein (located at the N terminus) (Binetruy et al., 3Binetruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Google Scholar; Boyle et al., 4Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H.K. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 573-584Google Scholar). Since v-src is a potent inducer of JNK, the kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of the activation domain of c-Jun (also known as SAPK) (Kyriakis et al., 27Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J.A. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar; Minden et al., 1995; Xie and Herschman, 53Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Google Scholar), we examined the role of this pathway in the function of the TRE and PRDII domain. The expression of a dominant negative mutant of SEK1 (SAPK/ERK kinase-1) reduced the activity of the TRE-controlled promoter in both normal and transformed CEF (Fig. 4D). This reduction ranged from 15 to 30% of total promoter activity in different experiments. In addition, the dominant negative mutant of SEK was generally just as efficient on the activity of the TRE at the nonpermissive and permissive temperature suggesting that the SAPK pathway was also involved in the control of the TRE activity in normal CEF (data not shown). A more pronounced effect of the SEK dominant negative mutant was observed on the activity of PRDII with inhibitions ranging from 35 to 55% (Fig. 4C). In addition, the inhibition was consistently more pronounced at the permissive temperature. We then examined the effect of MEKK, a kinase that is responsible for the activation of SEK and occupies a position analogous to that of c-Raf-1 in the MEK-ERK pathway. Since overexpression of MEKK may also lead to stimulation of MEK (Lange-Carter et al., 28Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Jonhson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Google Scholar; Yan et al., 56Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Google Scholar), various amounts of the MEKK expression vector were co-transfected in NY72-4 RSV-infected CEF. These results are presented in Fig. 4, A and B. Higher concentrations of MEKK enhanced modestly the activity of the TRE. In contrast, the activity of PRDII was stimulated markedly at all concentrations of plasmid DNA (Fig. 4A). Therefore, PRDII was more responsive to the action of MEKK, and a significant stimulation of the promoter was observed with DNA concentrations that had no significant effect on the TRE (such as 0.1 µg of the MEKK plasmid DNA; note the difference in scale for the y axis in A and B). The action of MEKK on PRDII was also more potent at the permissive temperature, an effect that was less pronounced on the TRE. Therefore, we conclude that MEKK and the SAPK pathway are important for the activation of the PRDII-binding factor by pp60v-src. In addition, this pathway is important for the activity of AP-1 at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperature suggesting that it is at least partially activated in normal CEF. To resolve this issue, we measured the activity of JNK/SAPK in normal and transformed CEF. To this end, an expression construct encoding an HA-tagged SAPKγ was transfected in NY72-4 RSV-infected CEF. SAPKγ was isolated by immunoprecipitation from cell lysates prepared from CEF transferred to the permissive temperature for 24 h or maintained at the nonpermissive temperature for the duration of the experiment. In addition, cells at the nonpermissive temperature were treated with anisomycin for a period of 40 min prior to cell lysis. GST-c-Jun was phosphorylated in vitro by the immunoprecipitated SAPK and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The results shown in Fig. 5A indicate that the activation of the thermolabile pp60v-src did not result in a significant induction of SAPK activity in CEF (lanes 3 and 4). The same experiment performed with total cell lysate (thus looking at total GST-c-Jun kinase activity) led to the same conclusion although a modest activation (of less than 3-fold) was often observed in CEF stably transformed by SR-A RSV (data not shown). Treating nontransformed CEF with anisomycin, a potent inducer of SAPK (Kyriakis et al., 27Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J.A. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar), enhanced the activity of the ectopically expressed kinase, but again this induction was modest (lane 5). It is possible that a limiting component of this pathway accounts for the poor activation of SAPK in our experimental conditions. Therefore, we also co-transfected vectors encoding SEK and MEKK and quantitated the level of SAPK activity at the permissive and nonpermissive temperature. The results of thi"
https://openalex.org/W1990451758,"Tyrosine kinases differ from serine/threonine kinases in sequences located at the active site where ATP and substrate bind. In the structure of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, the catalytic loop contains the sequence Lys-Pro-Glu where the Lys residue contacts the γ-phosphate of ATP and the Glu residue contacts a basic residue located in the peptide substrate. In tyrosine kinases, the analogous sequence is Ala-Ala-Arg in the receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily and Arg-Ala-Ala in the Src tyrosine kinase subfamily. To deduce the role of these residues in tyrosine kinase function, site-directed mutations were prepared in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and in v-Src and effects on ATP binding and kinase activity were determined. Changing Arg to either Lys or Ala dramatically reduced activity of both tyrosine kinases and this correlated with loss of ATP binding. Changing the orientation of this sequence impaired activity of EGFR to a greater extent than that of v-Src but did not change substrate specificity of the two enzymes. These results support the hypothesis that Arg functions to coordinate the γ-phosphate of ATP. Analysis of sequence inversions in the catalytic loop indicate that the active site of v-Src exhibits greater flexibility than that of EGFR."
