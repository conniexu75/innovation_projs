https://openalex.org/W2107274838,"Analyses of firm sizes have historically used data that included limited samples of small firms, data typically described by lognormal distributions. Using data on the entire population of tax-paying firms in the United States, I show here that the Zipf distribution characterizes firm sizes: the probability a firm is larger than size s is inversely proportional to s . These results hold for data from multiple years and for various definitions of firm size."
https://openalex.org/W2024970913,"In 1997, an H5N1 influenza A virus was transmitted from birds to humans in Hong Kong, killing 6 of the 18 people infected. When mice were infected with the human isolates, two virulence groups became apparent. Using reverse genetics, we showed that a mutation at position 627 in the PB2 protein influenced the outcome of infection in mice. Moreover, high cleavability of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein was an essential requirement for lethal infection."
https://openalex.org/W1938388466,"Integrins are alphabeta heterodimeric receptors that mediate divalent cation-dependent cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion through tightly regulated interactions with ligands. We have solved the crystal structure of the extracellular portion of integrin alphaVbeta3 at 3.1 A resolution. Its 12 domains assemble into an ovoid ""head"" and two ""tails."" In the crystal, alphaVbeta3 is severely bent at a defined region in its tails, reflecting an unusual flexibility that may be linked to integrin regulation. The main inter-subunit interface lies within the head, between a seven-bladed beta-propeller from alphaV and an A domain from beta3, and bears a striking resemblance to the Galpha/Gbeta interface in G proteins. A metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) in the betaA domain is positioned to participate in a ligand-binding interface formed of loops from the propeller and betaA domains. MIDAS lies adjacent to a calcium-binding site with a potential regulatory function."
https://openalex.org/W2090252305,"We report the synthesis of single-crystalline silver nanowires of atomic dimensions. The ultrathin silver wires with 0.4 nanometer width grow up to micrometer-scale length inside the pores of self-assembled calix[4]hydroquinone nanotubes by electro-/photochemical redox reaction in an ambient aqueous phase. The present subnanowires are very stable under ambient air and aqueous environments, unlike previously reported metal wires of approximately 1 nanometer diameter, which existed only transiently in ultrahigh vacuum. The wires exist as coherently oriented three-dimensional arrays of ultrahigh density and thus could be used as model systems for investigating one-dimensional phenomena and as nanoconnectors for designing nanoelectronic devices."

https://openalex.org/W2118866905,"In vertebrates, peripheral chemosensory neurons express large families of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), reflecting the diversity and specificity of stimuli they detect. However, somatosensory neurons, which respond to chemical, thermal, or mechanical stimuli, are more broadly tuned. Here we describe a family of approximately 50 GPCRs related to Mas1, called mrgs, a subset of which is expressed in specific subpopulations of sensory neurons that detect painful stimuli. The expression patterns of mrgs thus reveal an unexpected degree of molecular diversity among nociceptive neurons. Some of these receptors can be specifically activated in heterologous cells by RFamide neuropeptides such as NPFF and NPAF, which are analgesic in vivo. Thus, mrgs may regulate nociceptor function and/or development, including the sensation or modulation of pain."
https://openalex.org/W1993059855,"Bcl-2 family members bearing only the BH3 domain are essential inducers of apoptosis. We identified a BH3-only protein, Bmf, and show that its BH3 domain is required both for binding to prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins and for triggering apoptosis. In healthy cells, Bmf is sequestered to myosin V motors by association with dynein light chain 2. Certain damage signals, such as loss of cell attachment (anoikis), unleash Bmf, allowing it to translocate and bind prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins. Thus, at least two mammalian BH3-only proteins, Bmf and Bim, function to sense intracellular damage by their localization to distinct cytoskeletal structures."
https://openalex.org/W2011239877,"Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) eliminates mRNAs that prematurely terminate translation. We used antibody to the nuclear cap binding protein CBP80 or its cytoplasmic counterpart eIF4E to immunopurify RNP containing nonsense-free or nonsense-containing transcripts. Data indicate that NMD takes place in association with CBP80. We defined other components of NMD-susceptible mRNP as CBP20, PABP2, eIF4G, and the NMD factors Upf2 and Upf3. Consistent with the dependence of NMD on translation, the NMD of CBP80-bound mRNA is blocked by cycloheximide or suppressor tRNA. These findings provide evidence that translation can take place in association with CBP80. They also indicate that CBP80-bound mRNA undergoes a “pioneer” round of translation, before CBP80-CBP20 are replaced by eIF4E, and Upf2 and Upf3 proteins dissociate from upstream of exon-exon junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2017153527,"Obesity, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance are common forerunners of type 2 diabetes mellitus. We have identified the human winged helix/forkhead transcription factor gene FOXC2 as a key regulator of adipocyte metabolism. Increased FOXC2 expression, in adipocytes, has a pleiotropic effect on gene expression, which leads to a lean and insulin sensitive phenotype. FOXC2 affects adipocyte metabolism by increasing the sensitivity of the β-adrenergic-cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway through alteration of adipocyte PKA holoenzyme composition. Increased FOXC2 levels, induced by high fat diet, seem to counteract most of the symptoms associated with obesity, including hypertriglyceridemia and diet-induced insulin resistance—a likely consequence hereof would be protection against type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2153028137,"We developed an AIDS vaccine based on attenuated VSV vectors expressing env and gag genes and tested it in rhesus monkeys. Boosting was accomplished using vectors with glycoproteins from different VSV serotypes. Animals were challenged with a pathogenic AIDS virus (SHIV89.6P). Control monkeys showed a severe loss of CD4+ T cells and high viral loads, and 7/8 progressed to AIDS with an average time of 148 days. All seven vaccinees were initially infected with SHIV89.6P but have remained healthy for up to 14 months after challenge with low or undetectable viral loads. Protection from AIDS was highly significant (p = 0.001). VSV vectors are promising candidates for human AIDS vaccine trials because they propagate to high titers and can be delivered without injection."
https://openalex.org/W2080804906,"Bimetallic electrodes are used in a number of electrochemical processes, but the role of particular arrangements of surface metal atoms (ensembles) has not been studied directly. We have evaluated the electrochemical/catalytic properties of defined atomic ensembles in atomically flat PdAu(111) electrodes with variable surface stoichiometry that were prepared by controlled electrodeposition on Au(111). These properties are derived from infrared spectroscopic and voltammetric data obtained for electrode surfaces for which the concentration and distribution of the respective metal atoms are determined in situ by atomic resolution scanning tunneling microscopy with chemical contrast. Palladium monomers are identified as the smallest ensemble (""critical ensemble"") for carbon monoxide adsorption and oxidation, whereas hydrogen adsorption requires at least palladium dimers."
https://openalex.org/W2157194244,"The formation of morphogen gradients is essential for tissue patterning. Morphogens are released from producing cells and spread through adjacent tissue; paradoxically, however, many morphogens, including Wingless, associate tightly with the cell membrane. Here, we describe a novel cell biological mechanism that disperses membrane fragments over large distances through the Drosophila imaginal disc epithelium. We call these membrane exovesicles argosomes. Argosomes are derived from basolateral membranes and are produced by many different regions of the disc. They travel through adjacent tissue where they are found predominantly in endosomes. Wingless protein colocalizes with argosomes derived from Wingless-producing cells. The properties of argosomes are consistent with their being a vehicle for the spread of Wingless protein."
https://openalex.org/W2018914487,"In mammalian cells, splice junctions play a dual role in mRNA quality control: They mediate selective nuclear export of mature mRNA and they serve as a mark for mRNA surveillance, which subjects aberrant mRNAs with premature termination codons to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Here, we demonstrate that the protein RNPS1, a component of the postsplicing complex that is deposited 5' to exon-exon junctions, interacts with the evolutionarily conserved human Upf complex, a central component of NMD. Significantly, RNPS1 triggers NMD when tethered to the 3' untranslated region of beta-globin mRNA, demonstrating its role as a subunit of the postsplicing complex directly involved in mRNA surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W1993820504,"Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy are initiated by extracerebral exposure to prions. Although prion transmission from extracerebral sites to the brain represents a potential target for prophylaxis, attempts at vaccination have been limited by the poor immunogenicity of prion proteins. To circumvent this, we expressed an anti-prion protein (anti-PrP) μ chain in Prnp o/o mice. Transgenic mice developed sustained anti-PrP titers, which were not suppressed by introduction of Prnp + alleles. Transgene expression prevented pathogenesis of prions introduced by intraperitoneal injection in the spleen and brain. Expression of endogenous PrP (PrP C ) in the spleen and brain was unaffected, suggesting that immunity was responsible for protection. This indicates the feasibility of immunological inhibition of prion disease in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2164735945,"Nonsense-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) decay, or NMD, is a critical process of selective degradation of mRNAs that contain premature stop codons. NMD depends on both pre-mRNA splicing and translation, and it requires recognition of the position of stop codons relative to exon-exon junctions. A key factor in NMD is hUpf3, a mostly nuclear protein that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and interacts specifically with spliced mRNAs. We found that hUpf3 interacts with Y14, a component of post-splicing mRNA-protein (mRNP) complexes, and that hUpf3 is enriched in Y14-containing mRNP complexes. The mRNA export factors Aly/REF and TAP are also associated with nuclear hUpf3, indicating that hUpf3 is in mRNP complexes that are poised for nuclear export. Like Y14 and Aly/REF, hUpf3 binds to spliced mRNAs specifically ( approximately 20 nucleotides) upstream of exon-exon junctions. The splicing-dependent binding of hUpf3 to mRNAs before export, as part of the complex that assembles near exon-exon junctions, allows it to serve as a link between splicing and NMD in the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2019285457,"Genetic self-incompatibility in Brassica is determined by alleles of the transmembrane serine-threonine kinase SRK, which functions in the stigma epidermis, and of the cysteine-rich peptide SCR, which functions in pollen. Using tagged versions of SRK and SCR as well as endogenous stigma and pollen proteins, we show that SCR binds the SRK ectodomain and that this binding is allele specific. Thus, SRK and SCR function as a receptor-ligand pair in the recognition of self pollen. Specificity in the self-incompatibility response derives from allele-specific formation of SRK-SCR complexes at the pollen-stigma interface."
https://openalex.org/W2045234862,"Rhodamine-labeled phalloidin staining of morphologically differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes demonstrated that F-actin predominantly exists juxtaposed to and lining the inner face of the plasma membrane (cortical actin) with a smaller amount of stress fiber and/or ruffling actin confined to the cell bottom in contact with the substratum. The extent of cortical actin disruption with various doses of either latrunculin B or Clostridium difficiletoxin B (a Rho family small GTP-binding protein toxin) directly correlated with the inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation. The dissolution of the cortical actin network had no significant effect on proximal insulin receptor signaling events including insulin receptor autophosphorylation, tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate and Cbl, or serine/threonine phosphorylation of Akt. Surprisingly, however, stabilization of F-actin with jasplakinolide also resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation. In vivo time-lapse confocal fluorescent microscopy of actin-yellow fluorescent protein demonstrated that insulin stimulation initially results in cortical actin remodeling followed by an increase in polymerized actin in the peri-nuclear region. Importantly, the insulin stimulation of cortical actin rearrangements was completely blocked by treatment of the cells with latrunculin B, C. difficile toxin B, and jasplakinolide. Furthermore, expression of the dominant-interfering TC10/T31N mutant completely disrupted cortical actin and prevents any insulin-stimulated actin remodeling. Together, these data demonstrate that cortical actin, but not stress fibers, lamellipodia, or filopodia, plays an important regulatory role in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. In addition, cortical F-actin does not function in a static manner (e.g.barrier or scaffold), but insulin-stimulated dynamic cortical actin remodeling is necessary for the GLUT4 translocation process.

Thus, the overall insulin-dependent shift in the cellular dynamics of GLUT4 vesicle trafficking results in a net increase of GLUT4 protein levels on the cell surface, thereby increasing the rate of glucose uptake. Over the past several years it has become increasingly apparent that the cell cytoskeleton can have substantial influence over vesicle trafficking events. For example, fast axonal transport of synaptic vesicles to the pre-synaptic membrane requires the microtubule cytoskeleton and motors (13Schroer T.A. Curr. Opin.

The actin cytoskeleton has also been observed to have profound influence over regulated exocytosis; however, the functional role of actin in this process appears to be highly complex. For example, most secretory cells have a dense sheet of F-actin beneath and juxtaposed to the plasma membrane, referred to as cortical actin. Several studies (21Vitale M.L. Rodriguez Del Castillo A.

Furthermore, in some cases disruption of the actin cytoskeleton markedly potentiates agonist-stimulated secretion (26Muallem S. Kwiatkowska K. Xu X. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 27Sontag J.M. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 46: 316-326PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lelkes P.I. Friedman J.E.

In contrast, however, in many cell systems depletion of F-actin structures either by sequestering actin monomers or by stimulation of actin severing does not stimulate exocytosis but results in an inhibition of agonist-induced secretion (30Li G.

Because PI 3-kinase function is also necessary for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, these data suggested that membrane ruffling might play an important regulatory role. More recently, insulin-stimulated F-actin membrane ruffles in L6 myoblasts were found to accumulate at localized plasma membrane sites and to direct the localization of both the PI 3-kinase and GLUT4 protein (36Wang Q.

Although collectively these data suggest that the actin cytoskeleton plays a role in GLUT4 trafficking events, isolated primary rat adipocytes do not have significant amounts of stress fibers, lamellipodia, or filopodia but instead have a layer of cortical actin similar to that found in secretory cells (37Omata W. Shibata H. Li L. Takata K. Kojima I. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 321-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that both disruption and stabilization of adipocyte cortical actin inhibit insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Furthermore, using time-lapse confocal fluorescent microscopy, we directly demonstrate that insulin induces cortical actin remodeling, and it is the dynamic actin rearrangement process that is necessary for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation.

Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown on coverslips, and prior to microinjection, the medium was changed to Lebovitz’s L-15 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were impaled using Eppendorf model 5171 micromanipulator, and nuclei were injected with 50 μg/ml of the YFP-actin cDNA or 200 μg/ml of the TC10/T31N or Cdc42/T17N cDNAs in 100 mm KCl, 5 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.2, with an Eppendorf model 5246 transinjector. The cells were allowed to recover for 24 h and placed into a perfusion chamber maintained at 37 °C and visualized by time-lapse confocal fluorescent microscopy. 3T3L1 adipocyte plasma membrane sheets were prepared by rinsing the cells in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation with 0.5 mg/ml poly-d-lysine for 1 min. Cells were then swollen in a hypotonic buffer (23 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) by three successive rinses. The swollen cells were sonicated 3 s at power setting 5 with a surface of the cell monolayer in 10 ml of sonication buffer (70 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES, 6 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenlymethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). The bound plasma membrane sheets were washed twice in sonication buffer, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in the sonication buffer, and subjected to confocal fluorescent microscopy. Following experimental treatments, the cells were solubilized in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mmNaCl, 2% glycerol, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. After 20 min of rotation at 4 °C, the extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble material, and 50 μg of the total protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were then subjected to immunoblotting with either a rabbit polyclonal Akt antibody, a β-actin antibody, the monoclonal phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody, or the phospho-Akt (Thr-308) antibody and visualized by the SuperSignal Chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, whole cell extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of the monoclonal Cbl antibody. The samples were then precipitated with protein G PLUS-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and were immunoblotted as described above. Fully differentiated adipocytes are relatively large round lipid-laden cells that are morphologically quite distinct from their precursor fibroblasts. Because the actin cytoskeleton is dynamically regulated and intimately involved in cell morphology and motility, we examined the organization of F-actin during the differentiation of 3T3L1 fibroblasts to morphologically mature adipocytes (Fig. 1). Prior to differentiation, the precursor adipocytes (fibroblasts) primarily display long organized stress fibers typical of F-actin found in other fibroblast cell types. Even though the fibroblasts are relatively flat cells, stress fibers can be detected throughout the cells but are more pronounced at the cell bottom in contact with the substratum (Fig. 1, panels aand e). However, as the cells differentiate into a large rounded morphology, the long stress fiber F-actin structures are converted into F-actin that lines the inner face of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, panels b–d). In parallel, after 4 days of adipocyte differentiation the length of F-actin stress fibers visualized at the cell bottom were markedly decreased (Fig. 1,panel f). At longer times, the vast majority of stress fiber F-actin was reduced to small patches of punctate actin (Fig. 1,panels g and h). The distribution of F-actin in adipocytes is more readily apparent when visualized by stacked z axis confocal images (Fig. 2, panels a–l). These data demonstrate that the major form of F-actin in fully differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes is cortical actin underlying the plasma membrane.Figure 2Three-dimensional reconstruction of F-actin in morphologically differentiated adipocytes. Fully differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were fixed and labeled with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. Confocal images of various zaxis sections, every 3 μm from the top (panel a) to the bottom (panel l) were obtained. This visualization is from one representative cell that was independently verified three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies (38Kadowaki T.

Therefore, we next examined the relationship between stress fiber, membrane ruffles, cortical actin, and PI 3-kinase activity using the selective PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. 3). As expected, insulin stimulation resulted in a decrease in the amount of F-actin stress fibers concomitant to the formation of membrane ruffling in the pre-adipocyte cell population (Fig. 3 A, panels a and c). Wortmannin treatment also resulted in decrease in F-actin stress fibers but also completely prevented the insulin stimulation of membrane ruffling (Fig. 3 A, panels b and d). Although the relative extent of stress fiber and membrane ruffle types of F-actin was reduced in morphologically differentiated adipocytes, wortmannin had no significant effect on either cortical actin (Fig. 3 B, panels a and b) or the punctate actin at the cell bottom (Fig. 3 B, panels eand f). Similar to fibroblast, insulin was able to induced membrane ruffling at the cell bottom in contact with the substratum that was also sensitive to wortmannin (Fig. 3 B, panels g and h). Insulin was also able to remodel the cortical actin juxtaposed to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 B, panel c). Although the insulin effect on cortical actin was difficult to detect using rhodamine-labeled phalloidin staining of fixed cells, it was readily apparent when visualized by time-lapse confocal microscopy in living cells (see Fig. 9). In any case, wortmannin pretreatment had no significant effect on the distribution of cortical actin (Fig. 3 B, panel d). Together, these data directly demonstrate that in adipocytes the regulation and cellular distribution of cortical F-actin was distinct from F-actin involved in the formation of stress fibers and membrane ruffling.Figure 9Insulin stimulation results in both increased cortical actin rearrangements and polymerization of peri-nuclear actin in vivo. A, 3T3L1 adipocyte nuclei were microinjected with an expression plasmid encoding for YFP-actin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were then continuously visualized by confocal fluorescent microscopy and selected time images prior and subsequent to the addition of insulin are presented in panels a–d. The complete time-lapse image is provided in the Supplementary Material. B, quantitation of the fluorescent signal intensities at two regions of the plasma membrane and in the peri-nuclear region (indicated by the colored boxes) are presented. This is a representation of insulin-stimulated time courses of YFP-actin observed in four individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies (19Emoto E.

Consistent with these findings, latrunculin B inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A). As observed previously, rhodamine-labeled phalloidin staining demonstrated that the differentiated adipocytes contain polymerized actin underneath and juxtaposed to the inner face of the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 B, panel a). In parallel to the reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity, latrunculin B treatment resulted in a dose-dependent disruption of this cortical actin structure (Fig. 4 B, panels b–e). In the absence of latrunculin B only 2% of the cells displayed a discontinuous cortical actin rim, whereas the cortical actin structure was disrupted in 13% of the cells at 1 μm, 31% at 5 μm, 71% at 20 μm, and 91% at 60 μm latrunculin B. It is well established that Rho family members of small GTP-binding proteins play important regulatory roles in the control of actin polymerization (51Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem.

In addition, we have recently observed that the Rho family member protein TC10 plays a critical function in the insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation process (55Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We therefore took advantage of C. difficile toxin B, which inactivates Rho family small GTP-binding proteins (56Sehr P. Joseph G. Genth H. Just I. Pick E. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5296-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 57Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Incubation of adipocytes with toxin B resulted in a slight increase in glucose uptake in the basal state and also resulted in a biphasic response, with a slight enhancement of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake at 10 ng/ml toxin B followed by a dose-dependent inhibition (Fig. 5 A). In the basal state, toxin B treatment caused a slight increase in not only glucose uptake but also 125I-transferrin cell surface binding (data not shown), indicating that toxin B slightly increases general membrane exocytosis and/or inhibits endocytosis. In any case, higher concentrations of toxin B also resulted in a disruption of cortical actin structure (Fig. 5 B, panels a–e), suggesting that the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins primarily maintain the actin cytoskeleton organization in 3T3L1 adipocytes. Similar to the effect of latrunculin B, treatment with 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 μg/ml toxin B resulted in 14, 38, 74, and 85% of the cells displaying disrupted cortical actin structures. To confirm that the inhibition of glucose uptake by the disruption of cortical actin was, in fact, because of a block in GLUT4 translocation, the isolated plasma membrane sheets were examined for the presence of the GLUT4 protein (Fig. 6). As expected, insulin-stimulated a robust translocation of GLUT4 to"

Geodetic data collected after the Hector Mine earthquake exhibit a temporally decaying horizontal velocity field and a quadrant uplift pattern opposite to that expected for localized shear beneath the earthquake rupture. We interpret the origin of this accelerated crustal deformation to be vigorous flow in the upper mantle in response to the stress changes generated by the earthquake. Our results suggest that transient flow in the upper mantle is a fundamental component of the earthquake cycle and that the lower crust is a coherent stress guide coupling the upper crust with the upper mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2106875437,"Recently we reported that antibodies can generate hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) from singlet molecular oxygen ( 1 O 2 *). We now show that this process is catalytic, and we identify the electron source for a quasi-unlimited generation of H 2 O 2 . Antibodies produce up to 500 mole equivalents of H 2 O 2 from 1 O 2 *, without a reduction in rate, and we have excluded metals or Cl – as the electron source. On the basis of isotope incorporation experiments and kinetic data, we propose that antibodies use H 2 O as an electron source, facilitating its addition to 1 O 2 * to form H 2 O 3 as the first intermediate in a reaction cascade that eventually leads to H 2 O 2 . X-ray crystallographic studies with xenon point to putative conserved oxygen binding sites within the antibody fold where this chemistry could be initiated. Our findings suggest a protective function of immunoglobulins against 1 O 2 * and raise the question of whether the need to detoxify 1 O 2 * has played a decisive role in the evolution of the immunoglobulin fold."

Strikingly, two distinct conformations are observed, one compatible with cleavage, and the other in which the cleavage site is approximately 20 A from the catalytic center. Our analysis provides insight into the structural and energetic features that modulate the interconversion between these two forms and hence the rate of the self-cleavage reaction.

The structure reveals a novel protein-protein recognition strategy, in which an atypical RNA recognition motif (RRM) of U2AF35 and the U2AF65 polyproline segment interact via reciprocal ""tongue-in-groove"" tryptophan residues.

Experiments to determine luciferase activity for each condition were run in triplicate and normalized against CSPDTM substrate assay values per microgram of protein to ensure consistent transfection levels between experiments. hdnmt-1 promoter constructs in pGL-3 basic luciferase reporter vector were generated by PCR utilizing the following primer sets: wild-type ΔMT1 construct, 5′-CGGCTAGCCGGAATTCGCCCTTTGGTGTAA-3′ (MT1), 5′-CCAAGCTTGGAAGACCCTGCCTCACTCTGT-3′ (MT2); ΔMT2 (−1214 to +71 bp), 5′-CGGCTAGCCGGTGACAGAGTGAGGCAGGGT-3′(MT3), 5′-CCAAGCTTGGGGAAGATCACTTGAACCGGA-3′ (MT4); ΔMT3 (−815 to +71 bp), 5′-CGGCTAGCCGCTCAACCTCTGGAGTAGTTT-3′ (MT5), 5′-CCAAGCTTGGTTGCCACCTACTCTAGAAAA-3′ (MT6); ΔMT4 (−474 to +71), 5′-CGGCTAGCCGGAGTAGGTGGCAATTACCCC-3′ (MT7), 5′-CCAAGCTTGGTCCAAGCTCCACGTTTCCTG-3′ (MT8); and ΔMT5 (−243 to +71 bp), 5′-CGGCTAGCCGGAGCTTGGACGAGCCCACTC-3′ (MT9), 5′-CCAAGCTTGGATTCGCCCTTACATCGTCGG-3′ (MT10). We examined the effect of IL-6 treatment on methyltransferase activity by using K562 cells in a rested state in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.05% FBS for ∼48 h. The cells were rinsed twice in serum-free RPMI 1640 and then treated with IL-6 (at 100 ng/ml). After 8-h incubation, the cells were harvested, and methylation activity assays were performed as described previously (14Belinsky S.A. Nikula K.J. Baylin S.B. Issa J.P. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82–83: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) to determine the relative levels of activity following IL-6 treatment.Lanes 1 and 2 in Fig.1show the results obtained from control reactions utilizing only cell lysates with no poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) substrate added and poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) substrate with no cell lysates added, respectively. Lane 3 represents the basal level of methylation activity obtained from rested K562 cells, while lane 4 shows a 3.2-fold increase in activity following treatment with IL-6. Based on these observations, treatment with IL-6 appears to increase overall methylation activity. To determine whether treatment with IL-6 activates thehdnmt-1 promoter, we generated a series of deletion constructs as shown in Fig.2A. The constructs were sequenced and used to transfect K562 cells, which were rested prior to stimulation with IL-6 as described above. Gradual deletion of increasing amounts of the wild-type promoter as shown inlane 1 (ΔMT1), lane 2 (ΔMT2) (−1214 to +71 bp), lane 3 (ΔMT3) (-815 to +71 bp), and lane 4(ΔMT4) (−474 to +71) did not abrogate the IL-6-induced activity. The results shown in Fig. 2 B, lane 5, indicate that IL-6-induced promoter activity is localized to the ΔMT5 segment (−243 to +71 bp), which encodes several potential ETS family recognition sites. Fig. 2 C, lane 1, shows the results of transfecting wild-type ΔMT5 and then stimulating with IL-6. Unstimulated wild-type ΔMT5 reporter levels are represented inlane 2. Fig. 2 C, lanes 3 and4, show the activity levels of a ΔMT5 triple-mutant reporter stimulated with IL-6 and unstimulated, respectively. The ETS site-mutated ΔMT5 reporter shows a markedly suppressed response, as the loss of the three Fli-1 binding sites in ΔMT5 abrogated the IL-6-mediated response. To determine whether IL-6 induced increased expression ofhdnmt-1 and Fli-1 mRNA, K562 cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.05% FBS for ∼48 h. The cells were rinsed twice in serum-free RPMI 1640 and then treated with IL-6 at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Treated cells were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h post-treatment with IL-6. Total cellular RNA was prepared at each time point and stored at −70 °C. Ultraviolet spectroscopy was used to quantitate equally each RNA sample, and final working dilutions for each time point were rechecked following initial dilution to a concentration of 100 ng/µl. The adjusted total RNA preparations were then used to create cDNA, on which PCR reactions were performed. Using primers specific for hdnmt-1 and Fli-1, PCR was performed for each time point to determine the relative expression level of each gene. The temporal expression pattern of hdnmt-1 is shown in Fig. 3A. The expression ofhdnmt-1 begins to appear at 6 h post-treatment, reaching a peak between 8 and 12 h. At 24 h,hdnmt-1 mRNA is still expressed, but the level is considerably diminished. The double-banded PCR product seen for thehdnmt-1 is due to an intronic insertion, and the PCR primers were chosen to amplify this region to determine whether both possible gene products are affected equally by IL-6 (15Hsu D.W. Lin M.J. Lee T.L. Wen S.C. Chen X. Shen C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9751-9756Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In K562 cells, no difference in expression levels between the two possiblehdnmt-1 mRNA products were noted. The ETS family transcription factor, Fli-1, which is known to be expressed in megakaryocytic lineages as a mediator of differentiation (16Bastian L.S. Kwiatkowski B.A. Breininger J. Danner S. Roth G. Blood. 1999; 93: 2637-2644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), begins to be expressed at ∼4 h post-treatment (Fig. 3 B) and continues to increase throughout the sampling period. The expression pattern of the prototypic ETS family member, Ets-1, did not show a response to IL-6 when cDNA from the rested K562 cells was analyzed in parallel reactions withhdnmt-1 and Fli-1, and Ets-1 did not produce a discernable band when the reactions were analyzed at the midpoint of the amplification curve (data not shown.) Fig.3 C shows equivalent expression levels of the GAPDH gene cDNA control at each time point. Analysis of the ΔMT5 promoter elements reveals three potentialFli-1 binding sites at −194, −170, and −60 base pairs (17Bigey P. Ramchandani S. Theberge J. Araujo F.D. Szyf M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A series of singular and multiple point mutations of the ΔMT5 constructs, shown in Fig. 4a, were co-transfected into COS-1 cells with pSG5Fli-1expression plasmid to determine the authenticity of each potential ETS binding site. Fig. 4 b shows the strongest activation with all three potential Fli-1 binding sites left intact. The intact promoter construct ΔMT5-WT (lane 1) is transactivated nearly 29-fold over the triple mutant ΔMT5–25 (lane 8), which shows merely 2-fold activation over background. The other point-mutated ΔMT5 constructs showed varying degrees of activity, which suggests an additive effect for each site, with the constructs containing only single site mutations (ΔMT5–20 (lane 3), ΔMT5–22 (lane 5), and ΔMT5–23 (lane 6), showing the most activity when compared with those constructs receiving two combined site mutations ΔMT5–19 (lane 2), ΔMT5–21 (lane 4), and ΔMT5–24 (lane 7)). The mutation of the double ETS binding sites (−194 and −170) in the ΔMT5–24 construct (lane 7) produced nearly the same effect as the triple mutant, with a 5-fold increase in activity compared with 2-fold for the triple mutant. These results provide evidence of a novel mechanism of IL-6 cytokine-mediated alteration, via the Fli-1 transcription factor, of methyltransferase gene expression. Previously, it was shown that IL-6 activation of the immediate-early gene junB occurred through an ETS family protein, in cooperation with a CREB-ATF factor (18Nakajima K. Kusafuka T. Takeda T. Fujitani Y. Nakae K. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3027-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). An analogous situation exists in fos-transformed cells, in which the expression of DNA methyltransferase is three times that of normal levels (19Bakin A.V. Curran T. Science. 1999; 283: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that fostransformation is mediated by increased methyltranferase expression. Therefore, by analogy, even slight alterations in methyltransferase expression resulting from chronic exposure to IL-6 could, over time, result in abnormal patterns of cellular DNA methylation, similar to those caused by transformation of fos. Indeed, the importance of dnmt-1 activity in the establishment and propagation of neoplastic growth has emerged as an important diagnostic factor (20Petrangeli E. Lubrano C. Ravenna L. Vacca A. Cardillo M.R. Salvatori L. Sciarra F. Frati L. Gulino A. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 973-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Methylated CpG dinucleotides are susceptible to spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine to uracil and are believed to be responsible for approximately one-third of C-T transition mutations found in human genetic diseases and tumors (21Malik K. Brown K.W. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 1583-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes such as p53 (22Yebra M.J. Bhagwat A.S.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2229-2237PubMed Google Scholar) occur in many different tumors types, serving to promote tumor growth by rendering these genes inactive. The effects of promiscuous methylation of important tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulatory genes potentially resulting from prolonged exposure to inflammatory cytokines are probably cumulative in nature, remaining latent until sufficient insult to the cell permits it to transform into a neoplastic growth (25Nuovo G.J. Plaia T.W. Belinsky S.A. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12754-12759Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that IL-6, an inflammatory cytokine capable of mediating cellular differentiation, is capable of increasing DNA methytransferase expression and activity. The data suggest that one of the normal molecular consequences of the biological activity of IL-6 may be mediated by DNA methyltransferase activity modifying gene expression. Additionally, IL-6 has been implicated in numerous cancer models, including multiple myeloma and prostate carcinoma (26Goldberg D.M. Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 2360-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,27Wierzbowska A. Urbanska-Rys H. Robak T. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 105: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, in a few cell lines, IL-6 has shown inhibitory effects on tumorigenesis (28Chung T.D., Yu, J.J. Spiotto M.T. Bartkowski M. Simons J.W. Prostate. 1999; 38: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and anti-inflammatory capacity (29Spiotto M.T. Chung T.D. Prostate. 2000; 42: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding these pleiotropic characteristics, chronic exposure of cells to inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 may have serious consequences by altering the normal levels, or time of expression of many genes, by up-regulating methyltransferase, whose expression is normally tightly controlled in a cell cycle-dependent manner (30Tilg H.

Dysregulation of DNA methyltransferase may result in the methylation of important tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulatory genes eventually initiating or enhancing neoplastic growth (32Mizuno Si S.

The pathogenesis of this problem has been unclear, but it is associated with circulating immune complexes that contain platelet membrane components and anti-platelet membrane GPIIIa49-66 IgG antibodies. These antibodies cause acute thrombocytopenia when injected into mice. We now show that purified anti-GPIIIa49-66 causes platelet fragmentation, in vitro in the absence of complement, and in vivo in wild-type and C3-deficient mice. The mechanism of complement-independent platelet lysis is shown to be caused by the antibody-induced generation of H202, as indicated by in vitro experiments with inhibitors of reactive oxygen species, and in vivo studies carried out with p47phox-deficient mice. Thus, a novel mechanism of immunologic platelet clearance is described in which an anti-platelet IgG causes platelet fragmentation via the induction of reactive oxygen species."

The beta regulatory subunit of CK2 binds to TBP and is required for high TBP-associated CK2 activity and pol III transcription in unstressed cells. Transcriptional repression induced by DNA damage requires CK2 and coincides with downregulation of TBP-associated CK2 and dissociation of catalytic subunits from TBP-CK2 complexes. Therefore, CK2 is the terminal effector in a signaling pathway that represses pol III transcription when genome integrity is compromised."

Previously, we showed that Gas6 plays a pivotal role in mesangial cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we identified downstream targets of Gas6 signaling to examine the role in mesangial cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. We found that Gas6 tyrosine phosphorylates STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription) with concomitant translocation to the nucleus and induces STAT3-dependent transcriptional activation in cultured mesangial cells. Expressing dominant negative STAT3 inhibited Gas6-mediated transcriptional activation of STAT3 and abolished Gas6-induced mesangial cell proliferation. In a model of mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, STAT3 is phosphorylated in mesangial cells, and its phosphorylation peaks at day 8 after the injection of anti-Thy1.1 antibody. Inhibition of Gas6 by warfarin and the extracellular domain of its receptor, Axl, abolished phosphorylation of STAT3 in vivo.

Moreover, administration of these agents abolishes the induction of PDGF-B in Thy1 GN. Thus, Gas6 seems to be not only a mitogen for mesangial cells, but also to play a crucial role in the progression of glomerular diseases by modulating the expression of other growth factors.It has been previously reported that constitutive activation of Eyk, a member of the Axl superfamily (11Besser D. Bromberg J.F. Darnell J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), results in cell transformation in vitro without significant stimulation of the Ras/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway (11Besser D.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transforming activities of Eyk depend on phosphorylation of STAT3, a member of the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) protein family. STAT proteins are latent transcription factors that become activated by phosphorylation of single tyrosine, which causes STAT proteins to dimerize. STAT dimerization is usually followed by translocation to the nucleus (14Decker T. Kovarik P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, STAT proteins recognize and bind to consensus DNA binding sites that represent enhancer sequences for a variety of genes, including the immediate early growth response genes. Activation of STAT proteins is often associated with differentiation and growth regulation. For example, STAT3 activation has been implicated in proliferation of cells (15Fukada T. Hibi M.

Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), while STAT1 activation correlates with growth arrest of cells (16Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Wen Z.

In this study, we report that STAT3 is a key signaling molecule in Gas6-mediated mesangial cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. This study reveals the crucial role of STAT3 activation in the pathogenesis of experimental glomerulonephritis.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that STAT3 is a key signaling molecule in Gas6-mediated mesangial cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. We have shown that Gas6 phosphorylates STAT3 on tyrosine and the phosphorylation of STAT3 is mediated through the cell surface receptor, Axl. We have also shown that Gas6 stimulates translocation of phospho-STAT3 to the nucleus and STAT3-specific transcription. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and nuclear translocation of phospho-STAT3 are shown to be necessary and sufficient for its activities (25Bartoli M. Gu X. Tsai N.T. Venema R.C. Brooks S.E. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33189-33192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), our data indicates that Gas6 stimulates the activation of STAT3 through Axl. Further we have shown that Gas6-mediated mesangial cell proliferation depends on activation of STAT3. We have extended these in vitro observations to an in vivo model of glomerulonephritis. In Thy1 GN, STAT3 is heavily phosphorylated in the nuclei of glomerular cells. This phosphorylation parallels the increase in mesangial cell proliferation and peaks at day 8 when the expression of Gas6 as well as mesangial cell proliferation peaks. Most of the cells with phospho-STAT3 were shown to be mesangial cells. Furthermore, interference of the Gas6-specific pathway by the administration of warfarin or Axl-Fc completely inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 in glomeruli as well as the mesangial cell proliferation. Thus, our study has identified STAT3 as a signaling molecule involved in the development of glomerulonephritis and implicated it as a novel target of the therapeutic strategy for kidney disease.It is intriguing to note that interference of the Gas6-mediated pathway in Thy1 GN completely inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 as well as mesangial cell proliferation, although other growth factors and cytokines (26Floege J. Topley N. Resch K. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1991; 17: 673-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Floege J. Eng E. Young B.A. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int.

Invest. 1993; 92: 2952-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) present in Thy1 GN can stimulate phosphorylation of STAT3 as well. Therefore, our findings indicate that Gas6-mediated STAT3 activation would be one of the initial events in the development of Thy1 GN and suggest that STAT3 is a critical signaling molecule of Gas6-mediated glomerular proliferation and might regulate the development of glomerular diseases by modulating the expression of other growth factors. It would be more important to study the role of Gas6 and STAT3 in a chronic model of glomerulonephritis.As we showed in a previous report, Gas6 plays a crucial role in the development of glomerulonephritis, and the expression of Gas6 in the mesangial region could be a marker showing the activities of mesangial proliferation and glomerulonephritis (10Yanagita M. Arai H. Ishii K. Nakano T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Varnum B. Fukatsu A. Doi T. Kita T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1423-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have provided evidence that STAT3 is another marker of mesangial cell proliferation, because phosphorylation of STAT3 is increased in parallel with the activity of mesangial proliferation, and our immunofluorescent study revealed that the site of STAT3 phosphorylation is mainly in the glomerulus rather than in the tubulus, corresponding to the site of proliferation in Thy1 GN. Further, results of double immunostaining of phospho-STAT3 and αSMA indicate that the nuclei of mesangial cells are the sites of STAT3 phosphorylation. Thus, our data indicate that STAT3 is a pivotal mediator of mesangial cell proliferation. Therefore, it would be intriguing to examine whether phosphorylation of STAT3 can be detected in human glomerulonephritis, such as lupus nephritis and IgA glomerulonephritis, and whether phosphorylation is related to the activity and prognosis of glomerulonephritis.In mouse mesangial cells, the transfection efficiency was about 60% with LipofectAMINE plus (data not shown). Despite the presence of about 40% of untransfected cells, Gas6-mediated mesangial cell proliferation is totally inhibited by the transfection of dominant negative STAT3. This result might be due to the effect of some unknown factors secreted from growth-arrested cells transfected with dominant negative STAT3 on the proliferation of untransfected cells. On the other hand, proliferative response to PDGF-BB was not affected by the transfection of dominant negative STAT3. Therefore, activation of STAT3 might not be necessary for the mitogenic activities of PDGF-BB in mesangial cells.Activation of STAT3 by Eyk is considered to occur directly after the binding of STAT3 via its SH2 domain to the 933YVPQ sequence present in v-Eyk and by subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (11Besser D. Bromberg J.F. Darnell J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similar sequences (Y XXQ) are also shown to be important for STAT3 activation in several cytokine receptors (30Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D.

Earp H.S. Liu E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5016-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). However, we could not demonstrate the direct binding of STAT3 to Axl (data not shown). One explanation may be because of the rapid and transient binding of STAT3 and Axl. As seen in Fig. 1 C, phospho-STAT3 was rapidly translocated to the nucleus and could not be seen in the cytoplasm. The phenomenon was similar at 5 min after the addition of Gas6, and phospho-STAT3 could not be detected earlier than 5 min (data not shown).In conclusion, our study establishes an important role for STAT3 in Gas6-mediated mesangial cell proliferation. These data led us to speculate that inhibition of STAT3 activation in vivo could limit the extent of mesangial cell proliferation. Recently, it was shown that inhibition of STAT3 activation by the administration of dominant negative STAT3 results in suppression of cell transformation and tumor progression in vivo (33Niu G. Heller R. Catlett-Falcone R. Coppola D. Jaroszeski M. Dalton W. Jove R. Yu H. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5059-5063PubMed Google Scholar, 34Ni Z. Lou W. Leman E.S. Gao A.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1225-1228PubMed Google Scholar). A better understanding of the Gas6-STAT3 pathway could provide a basis for new and specific targets for therapeutic interventions in various kidney diseases associated with mesangial cell proliferation. Mesangial cell proliferation is a characteristic feature of many types of glomerular diseases and is usually associated with matrix expansion, leading to the development of end stage kidney disease (1Fogo A. Ichikawa I. Semin. Nephrol. 1989; 9: 329-342PubMed Google Scholar, 2Striker L.J. Doi T. Elliot S. Striker G.E. Semin. Nephrol. 1989; 9: 318-328PubMed Google Scholar, 3Striker L.J. Peten E.P. Elliot S.J. Doi T. Striker G.E. Lab. Invest. 1991; 64: 446-456PubMed Google Scholar). Since the proliferation of mesangial cells is essential for the pathogenesis and progression of glomerular diseases, several studies have attempted to suppress mesangial cell proliferation by inhibiting specific mitogens, such as PDGF1 and basic fibroblast growth factor (4Johnson R.J.

Gordon K.L. Pippin J. Alpers C.E. Couser W.G. Sage E.H. Johnson R.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1153-1167PubMed Google Scholar). Among the mitogens for mesangial cells Gas6 is unique because its activation is vitamin K-dependent and is inhibited by the anticoagulant warfarin (7Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 8Nakano T. Higashino K. Kikuchi N. Kishino J. Nomura K. Fujita H. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5702-5705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recently we showed that Gas6 is an autocrine growth factor for mesangial cells (9Yanagita M. Ishii K. Ozaki H. Arai H. Nakano T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Kita T. Doi T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2503-2509PubMed Google Scholar) and that warfarin and the extracellular domain of Axl (a receptor for Gas6) abolish mesangial cell proliferation by specific inhibition of the Gas6-mediated pathway in experimental glomerulonephritis (10Yanagita M. Arai H. Ishii K. Nakano T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Varnum B. Fukatsu A. Doi T. Kita T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1423-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, administration of these agents abolishes the induction of PDGF-B in Thy1 GN. Thus, Gas6 seems to be not only a mitogen for mesangial cells, but also to play a crucial role in the progression of glomerular diseases by modulating the expression of other growth factors. It has been previously reported that constitutive activation of Eyk, a member of the Axl superfamily (11Besser D. Bromberg J.F. Darnell J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), results in cell transformation in vitro without significant stimulation of the Ras/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway (11Besser D. Bromberg J.F. Darnell J.E. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Zong C. Yan R. August A. Darnell J.E. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which is activated by many oncogenes in the process of cell transformation (13Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transforming activities of Eyk depend on phosphorylation of STAT3, a member of the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) protein family. STAT proteins are latent transcription factors that become activated by phosphorylation of single tyrosine, which causes STAT proteins to dimerize. STAT dimerization is usually followed by translocation to the nucleus (14Decker T. Kovarik P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, STAT proteins recognize and bind to consensus DNA binding sites that represent enhancer sequences for a variety of genes, including the immediate early growth response genes. Activation of STAT proteins is often associated with differentiation and growth regulation. For example, STAT3 activation has been implicated in proliferation of cells (15Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), while STAT1 activation correlates with growth arrest of cells (16Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Schreiber R.D. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7673-7678Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 17Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.C. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). To elucidate molecular mechanisms of Gas6-mediated mesangial cell proliferation, we sought to identify downstream signaling components of the Gas6/Axl pathway essential for its various activities. In this study, we report that STAT3 is a key signaling molecule in Gas6-mediated mesangial cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. This study reveals the crucial role of STAT3 activation in the pathogenesis of experimental glomerulonephritis. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that STAT3 is a key signaling molecule in Gas6-mediated mesangial cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. We have shown that Gas6 phosphorylates STAT3 on tyrosine and the phosphorylation of STAT3 is mediated through the cell surface receptor, Axl. We have also shown that Gas6 stimulates translocation of phospho-STAT3 to the nucleus and STAT3-specific transcription. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and nuclear translocation of phospho-STAT3 are shown to be necessary and sufficient for its activities (25Bartoli M. Gu X. Tsai N.T. Venema R.C. Brooks S.E. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33189-33192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), our data indicates that Gas6 stimulates the activation of STAT3 through Axl. Further we have shown that Gas6-mediated mesangial cell proliferation depends on activation of STAT3. We have extended these in vitro observations to an in vivo model of glomerulonephritis. In Thy1 GN, STAT3 is heavily phosphorylated in the nuclei of glomerular cells. This phosphorylation parallels the increase in mesangial cell proliferation and peaks at day 8 when the expression of Gas6 as well as mesangial cell proliferation peaks. Most of the cells with phospho-STAT3 were shown to be mesangial cells. Furthermore, interference of the Gas6-specific pathway by the administration of warfarin or Axl-Fc completely inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 in glomeruli as well as the mesangial cell proliferation. Thus, our study has identified STAT3 as a signaling molecule involved in the development of glomerulonephritis and implicated it as a novel target of the therapeutic strategy for kidney disease.It is intriguing to note that interference of the Gas6-mediated pathway in Thy1 GN completely inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 as well as mesangial cell proliferation, although other growth factors and cytokines (26Floege J. Topley N. Resch K. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1991; 17: 673-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Floege J. Eng E. Young B.A. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int.

Invest. 1993; 92: 2952-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) present in Thy1 GN can stimulate phosphorylation of STAT3 as well. Therefore, our findings indicate that Gas6-mediated STAT3 activation would be one of the initial events in the development of Thy1 GN and suggest that STAT3 is a critical signaling molecule of Gas6-mediated glomerular proliferation and might regulate the development of glomerular diseases by modulating the expression of other growth factors. It would be more important to study the role of Gas6 and STAT3 in a chronic model of glomerulonephritis.As we showed in a previous report, Gas6 plays a crucial role in the development of glomerulonephritis, and the expression of Gas6 in the mesangial region could be a marker showing the activities of mesangial proliferation and glomerulonephritis (10Yanagita M.

In the present study, we have provided evidence that STAT3 is another marker of mesangial cell proliferation, because phosphorylation of STAT3 is increased in parallel with the activity of mesangial proliferation, and our immunofluorescent study revealed that the site of STAT3 phosphorylation is mainly in the glomerulus rather than in the tubulus, corresponding to the site of proliferation in Thy1 GN. Further, results of double immunostaining of phospho-STAT3 and αSMA indicate that the nuclei of mesangial cells are the sites of STAT3 phosphorylation. Thus, our data indicate that STAT3 is a pivotal mediator of mesangial cell proliferation. Therefore, it would be intriguing to examine whether phosphorylation of STAT3 can be detected in human glomerulonephritis, such as lupus nephritis and IgA glomerulonephritis, and whether phosphorylation is related to the activity and prognosis of glomerulonephritis.In mouse mesangial cells, the transfection efficiency was about 60% with LipofectAMINE plus (data not shown). Despite the presence of about 40% of untransfected cells, Gas6-mediated mesangial cell proliferation is totally inhibited by the transfection of dominant negative STAT3. This result might be due to the effect of some unknown factors secreted from growth-arrested cells transfected with dominant negative STAT3 on the proliferation of untransfected cells. On the other hand, proliferative response to PDGF-BB was not affected by the transfection of dominant negative STAT3.

These different sequences enable interactions to occur with a broad array of protein ligands that modulate a wide range of biological functions in development, differentiation, homeostasis, and bacterial/viral entry (reviewed in Refs. 4Bernfield M.

The specificity of any HS and protein interaction is largely dictated by arrangements of sulfates along the chain. For example, the pentasaccharide sequence, GlcNAc/NS6S-GlcUA-GlcNS3S±6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S, represents the minimum sequence for antithrombin (AT) binding, where the 3S (3-O-sulfate) and 6S(6-O-sulfate) groups constitute the most critical elements involved in the interaction (12Atha D.H.

To delineate the biosynthetic pathway that regulates anticoagulant heparan sulfate (HSact) biosynthesis, our laboratory has purified as well as molecularly cloned 3-OST-1 (17,18). We have demonstrated that 3-OST-1, usually existing in limited amounts, acts upon HSact precursor to produce HSact and upon HSinact precursor to produce 3-O-sulfated HSinact (17Shworak N.W. Liu J.

When 3-OST-1 is no longer limiting, the capacity for HSact generation is determined by the abundance of HSact precursors (20Zhang L. Yoshida K. Liu J. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5681-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this case, the limitation in HSact production is the presence of the critical 6-O-sulfate groups and/or the availability of proper epimerization/sulfation patterns in the precursors. In most cases, the critical 6S in the AT binding oligosaccharides sequenced and characterized in heparin is attached to GlcNAc residues (a summary table for heparin is presented in Refs. 21Loganathan D. Wang H.M. Mallis L.M. Linhardt R.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4362-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Conrad H.E. Heparin-Binding Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). We previously reported that the critical 6S in HSact from F9 cells is exclusively attached to GlcNAc residues (20Zhang L. Yoshida K. Liu J. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5681-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To date, three 6-O-sulfotransferases have been cloned, but reported substrate specificities indicate that none of them can put a 6-O-sulfate group on GlcNAc residues (2Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To understand how specific 6-O-sulfotransferases and other factors regulate HSact biosynthesis, we created cell mutants that are defective in the formation of HSact precursors. We chose Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, because a series of HS biosynthetic mutants have been successfully made in this cell line (23Esko J.D. Weinke J.L. Taylor W.H. Ekborg G. Rodén L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27733-27740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, CHO wild-type cells do not generate 3-O-sulfated residues and therefore do not make any HSact. Using recombinant retroviral transduction, we have introduced the HS 3-O-sulfotransferase-1 (3-OST-1) gene into CHO cells (29Zhang L. Lawrence R. Schwartz J.J. Bai X. Wei G. Esko J.D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28806-28813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 3-OST-1 expression gives rise to CHO cells with the ability to produce HSact. A cell line was chosen that has three copies of 3-OST-1 as determined by Southern analysis (29Zhang L. Lawrence R. Schwartz J.J. Bai X. Wei G. Esko J.D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28806-28813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After chemical mutagenesis of this cell line, mutant cells that were positive for FGF-2 binding but negative for AT binding were FACS sorted and cloned. The scheme for making HSact precursor mutants is outlined in Fig. 1. The advantage of having multiple copies of 3-OST-1 is that other upstream genes that are responsible for generating specific HS precursor structures can be sought after chemical mutagenesis without concern for the loss of 3-OST-1. FGF-2 selection is employed to ensure that the mutant cells still make HS. By using this scheme, we obtained a 6-O-sulfate-defective mutant. After correcting the mutant with 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 transfection, we created a cell line that makes HS, 50% of which is HSact. This represents the highest percentage of HSact production by any cell line reported so far. The approach used in this study includes placing multiple copies of a downstream enzyme in CHO cells, mutagenizing the cells to obtain mutants deficient in upstream enzymes that are part of the pathway, and then characterizing the mutants. This technique may constitute a general approach for defining and obtaining the components of biosynthetic pathways once the terminal biosynthetic enzyme has been obtained and proteins that recognize the final product of the pathway are available. Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-61, ATCC, Rockville, MD). Wild-type and mutant cells were maintained in Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and 100% relative humidity. The cells were passaged every 3–4 days with 0.125% (w/v) trypsin and 1 mm EDTA, and after 10–15 cycles, fresh cells were revived from stocks stored under liquid nitrogen. Low-sulfate medium was composed of Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml) and 10% fetal bovine serum that had been dialyzed 200-fold against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (30Dulbecco R. Vogt M. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 99: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar). Low-glucose Ham’s F-12 medium contained 1 mm glucose supplemented with penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), and fetal bovine serum that had been dialyzed 200-fold against PBS (30Dulbecco R. Vogt M. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 99: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar). All tissue culture media and reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) unless otherwise indicated. The method of 3-OST-1 recombinant retroviral transduction into CHO cells was described in detail in our previous publication (29Zhang L. Lawrence R. Schwartz J.J. Bai X. Wei G. Esko J.D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28806-28813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The same procedure has been used as described previously (29Zhang L. Lawrence R. Schwartz J.J. Bai X. Wei G. Esko J.D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28806-28813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nearly confluent monolayers of 3-OST-1-transduced CHO-K1 cells were detached by adding 10 ml of 2 mm EDTA in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum and centrifuged. The cell pellets were placed on ice, and 50 μl each of fluorescein-AT and Alexa 594-FGF-2 were added. After 30 min, the cells were washed once and resuspended in 1 ml of 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS containing 2 mm EDTA. Flow cytometry and cell sorting was performed on FACScan and FACStar instruments (Becton Dickinson) using dual color detection filters. Cells positive for AT and FGF-2 binding were sorted and subsequently single-cell-cloned into a 96-well plate. The single-cell clones were expanded and frozen for further analysis. Twelve 3-OST-1-transduced CHO-K1 clones were obtained as described above. The number of copies of 3-OST-1 in the individual clones was determined by Southern analysis. Genomic DNA (10 μg) was digested with 40 units of EcoRI overnight at 37 °C, electrophoresed on a 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel, transferred to GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and probed with 3-OST-1 cDNA labeled with the Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were hybridized in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) containing 3-OST-1 probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml), followed by autoradiography. The cell clone with three copies of 3-OST-1 was expanded and frozen for further studies. Wild-type CHO cells with three copies of 3-OST-1 were mutagenized with ethylmethane sulfonate as described in the literature (31Esko J.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 387-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and frozen under liquid nitrogen. A portion of cells was thawed, propagated for 3 days, and labeled with both Alexa 594-FGF-2 and fluorescein-AT. The labeled cells were sorted, and FGF-2-positive and AT-negative cells were collected. Approximately 1 × 104 sorted cells were collected into 1 ml of complete F-12 Ham’s media then plated in T-75 flasks. Sorted cell populations were maintained in complete F-12 Ham’s medium for 1 week, then the cells were labeled and sorted again as described above. After five rounds of sorting, FGF-2-positive and AT-negative cells were single-cell-sorted into a 96-well plate. The single-cell clones were expanded and frozen for further analysis. The sorting profiles of CHO-K1 with three copies of 3-OST-1, mutant, and the 6-OST-1 correctant of the mutant were shown by dual-color fluorescence flow cytometric analysis (see Fig. 2) The method was the same as one published previously (29Zhang L. Lawrence R. Schwartz J.J. Bai X. Wei G. Esko J.D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28806-28813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Sequences coding for CHO 6-OST-1 were amplified from a CHO-K1/cDNA quick-clone library (CLONTECH). The reaction mixture contained 2 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), 1 ng of cDNA, and 100 pmol of the primers. The sense primer has an added BglII site (5′-GCAGATCTGCAGGACCATGGTTGAGCGCGCCAGCAAGTTC-3′), and the antisense primer has an added XbaI site (5′-GCTCTAGACTACCACTTCTCAATGATGTGGCTC-3′). The 6-OST-1 primer sequences are derived from the human 6-OST-1 cDNA sequence (from residues 240 to 264) and to the complement of this sequence (from residues 1147 to 1172) as reported (32Habuchi H. Kobayashi M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9208-9213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After 30 thermal cycles (1 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 2 min of annealing at 55 °C, 3 min of extension at 72 °C), the amplification products were analyzed in 1% agarose gels and detected by ethidium bromide staining. The amplification products were excised from the gel and cleaned by Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). The PCR product was treated with BglII and XbaI, ligated into XbaI- and BamHI-digested pInd/Hygro plasmid (CLONTECH), and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α-competent cells. Four clones from each of two separate PCR reactions were sequenced and found to be identical. pInd/Hygro 6-OST-1-containing plasmid was transfected into the CHO mutant cells. Cells positive for AT and FGF-2 binding were sorted and subsequently single-cell-cloned into a 96-well plate. The single-cell clones were expanded and frozen for further analysis. The standard reaction mixture contained 50 mm MES (pH 7.0), 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.075 mg/ml protamine chloride, 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, either metabolically labeled [35S]HS or non-radioactive HS chains, cold PAPS (0.5 mm) or [35S]PAPS (25 μm, 2 × 107 cpm), and 70 ng of purified baculovirus-expressed human 6-OST-1 in a final volume of 50 μl. The mixtures were incubated either 20 min or overnight at 37 °C, and 200 μg of chondroitin sulfate C was added. HS chains were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and anion exchange chromatography on 0.25-ml columns of DEAE-Sephacel packed in 1-ml syringes (20Zhang L. Yoshida K. Liu J. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5681-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After ethanol precipitation, the pellets were washed with 75% ethanol, dried briefly under vacuum, and dissolved in water for further analysis. The procedure is identical to that described previously (29Zhang L. Lawrence R. Schwartz J.J. Bai X. Wei G. Esko J.D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28806-28813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8), heparitinase II (no EC number), and heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7) were obtained from Seikagaku, and heparitinase IV was a gift from Dr. Yoshida, Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo. Heparitinase I recognizes the sequences GlcNAc/NS±6S(3S?)-↓GlcUA/IdoUA-GlcNAc/NS±6S. The arrow indicates the cleavage site. Heparitinase II has broad sequence recognition: GlcNAc/NS±6S(3S?)-↓GlcUA/IdoUA±2S-GlcNAc/NS±6S. Heparinase (heparitinase III) and heparitinase IV recognize the sequences GlcNS±3S±6S-↓IdoUA2S/GlcUA2S-GlcNS±6S. The reaction products and references can be found in Refs. 33Yamada S. Yoshida K.

The digestion of HSact was carried out in 100 μl of 40 mmammonium acetate (pH 7.0) containing 3.3 mmCaCl2 with 1 milliunit (mU) of heparitinase I or 1 mU of each heparitinase I, heparitinase II, heparitinase IV, and heparinase (heparitinase III). The digestion was incubated at 37 °C overnight unless otherwise indicated. For low pH nitrous acid degradation, radiolabeled HS samples were mixed with 10 μg of bovine kidney HS (ICN) and digested (35Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Disaccharides were purified by Bio-Gel P2 chromatography and resolved by ion pairing reverse-phase HPLC with appropriate disaccharide standards (36Liu J. Shriver Z. Blaiklock P. Yoshida K. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38155-38162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Bio-Gel P2 or P6 columns (0.75 × 200 cm) were equilibrated with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Radiolabeled samples (200 μl) were mixed with dextran blue (5 μg) and phenol red (5 μg) and loaded onto the column. The samples were eluted at a flow rate of 4 ml/h with collection of 0.5-ml fractions. The desired fractions were dried under vacuum, individually or pooled, to remove ammonium bicarbonate. It has been reported that heparin molecules exhibiting a high affinity for a synthetic peptide (CRPKAKAKAKAKDQTK) mimicking a heparin-binding domain of heparin interacting protein (HIP) also show an extremely high affinity for AT (37Liu S. Zhou F. Hook M. Carson D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We expected that inclusion of this small peptide in the heparitinase digestion solution would protect 3-O-[35S]sulfate-labeled HS from degrading into tetrasaccharide. Theoretically, we should recover HIP peptide-protected, AT-binding HS oligosaccharides. However, in the presence of the HIP peptide, all the 3-O-[35S]sulfate-labeled sugars were degraded into disaccharides instead of oligosaccharides or tetrasaccharides as judged by their elution position on Bio-Gel P2 and their unique elution positions on IPRP-HPLC (the major 3-O-[35S]sulfate-containing disaccharides eluted right before ΔUA-GlcNS6S disaccharide standard). Because there is no ΔUA-GlcNS3S standard reported, we decided to prove the structure. We first made stable isotope PAP34S. The PAP34S (99% isotope purity determined by ESI-MS) was prepared by incubating ATP and stable isotope Na234SO4 (Isonics Corp.) with ATP sulfurylase (Sigma Chemical Co.), adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate kinase (a generous gift from Dr. Irwin H. Segel), and inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma) (38MacRae I.J. Rose A.B. Segel I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28583-28589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HS chains from wild-type CHO cells were labeled with pure 3-OST-1 plus PAP34S. We then developed a capillary IPRP-HPLC (LC Packings) method for separating HS disaccharides, which is similar to a conventional IPRP-HPLC (29Zhang L. Lawrence R. Schwartz J.J. Bai X. Wei G. Esko J.D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28806-28813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) except that 5 mm dibutylamine is used as an ion-pairing reagent (Sigma), and then coupled it to an electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Mariner Workstation, PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc.) to detect the mass of each disaccharide eluted. Six HS disaccharide standards from Seikagaku were separated by capillary HPLC and detected by negative polarity ESI-MS. The accuracy of the ESI-MS is ± 0.001 m/z unit after calibration with the molecular standard sets supplied by the manufacture (bis-trifluorobenzoic acid, heptadecafluorononanoic acid, perfluorotetradecanoic acid). 3-O-34S-labeled HS was digested with a combination of 1 mU of each heparitinase I, heparitinase II, heparitinase IV, and heparinase in the absence or presence of 0.5 mg/ml HIP peptide. 0.5 μg of digested HS was injected into capillary HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry (see Fig. 3). UV peak Beluted at the same time as a ΔUA-GlcNS6S standard, whereas UV peak D eluted at the same time as a ΔUA2S-GlcNS standard (see Fig. 3 A). Three major ions with m/z 247.5, 496.0, and 625.2 were observed in both UV peaks (see Fig. 3, panels B and D), where 496.0 is z1 (−1)-charged, 247.5 is z2 (−2)-charged, and 625.2 is one dibutylamine-adducted with z1 (−1)-charged ΔUA-GlcNS6S or ΔUA2S-GlcNS disaccharides. However, when the m/z region 494.0–501.0 from both peaks B and D were expended (panels C and E), a non-natural abundant, z1-charged molecular ion with m/z 498.0 was observed in UV peak Bbut not in UV peak D. 498.0 versus 496.0 of disaccharide ions should represent ΔUA-GlcNS3[34S]S and ΔUA-GlcNS6S, respectively. The mass for ΔUA-GlcNS3[34S]S was barely detectable in the absence of HIP peptide, which is consistent with the literature that 3-O-sulfate-containing sugars are usually degraded into tetrasaccharides, not disaccharides, by a mixture of heparitinase digestion (20Zhang L. Yoshida K. Liu J. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5681-5691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Yamada S. Yoshida K. Sugiura M. Sugahara K. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4780-4787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, HIP peptide is included in heparitinase digestion when we degrade 3-O-containing HS into disaccharides. To generate specific Northern blot hybridization probes, PCR primers were designed that bracket unique sequences within human 6-OST-1, 6-OST-2 and 6-OST-3. A 249-bp PCR product that corresponds to a region within the 3′-UTR of the 6-OST-1 gene starting at position 1772 and ending at 2021 was used as an isoform specific probe. Similarly, a 299-bp PCR product that corresponds to a region in the 3′-UTR of the 6-OST-2 gene starting at position 1831 and ending at 2130, and another product within the 3′-UTR of the 6-OST-3 gene starting at 943 and ending at 1378 (444 bp) were used as a probe. PCR was performed with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and isoform-specific radiolabeled probes were purified on G-25 Sephadex spin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridizations were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 2 × 106 cpm probe per milliliter of ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH). After the hybridizations were complete, the blots were washed twice in 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS and once with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, all at room temperature. Blots were then washed with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. For blots hybridized with the 6-OST-1 probe, this last wash was repeated twice at 65 °C. The membranes were then subjected to autoradiography with BioMax imaging film (Kodak) with a BioMax MS intensifying screen (Kodak). For RT-PCR, poly(A)-purified or DNase I-treated total RNA was used. Primer pairs were designed that bracket isoform-specific regions within the human sequences for both 6-OST-2 and 6-OST-3. For 6-OST-1, a 569-bp fragment corresponding to nt 54 (GCG TGC TTC ATG CTC ATC CT) to 622 (GTG CGC CCA TCA CAC ATG T) within the hamster sequence was used. For 6-OST-2, PCR targets included regions starting at nt 23 (CTG CTG CTG GCT TTG GTG AT) and 346 (GCA GAA GAA ATG CAC TTG CCA) and ending at nt 1471 (GCC GCT ATC ACC TTG TCC CT), 1491 (TCA TTG GTG CCA TTG CTG G), and 1532 (TGA GTG CCA GTT AGC GCC A). For 6-OST-3, the targets included regions that start at nt 5 (CCG GTG CTC ACT TTC CTC TTC) and 353 (TTC ACC CTC AAG GAC CTG ACC) and end at nt 988 (GCT CTG CAG CAG GAT GGT GT) and 1217 (GCT GGA AGA GAT CCT TCG CAT AC). Total RNA was purified from wild-type and mutant CHO-K1 cells using the RNeasy total RNA kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm, and 100 μg of total RNA was reacted with DNase I (Ambion) at 37 °C for 45 min, twice extracted with equal volumes of acid phenol/chloroform, precipitated in ethanol, and reconstituted in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Further selection of poly(A) plus RNA was carried out with the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). RNA integrity was checked after electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, and all RT reactions were run with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Ambion) according to manufacturer’s instructions. PCR was performed with Super Taq polymerase (Ambion).

We now demonstrate that not only TRL-derived apoE but also lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is efficiently recycled in vitro and in vivo. Similar recycling kinetics of apoE and LPL in normal and low density lipoprotein receptor-negative human fibroblasts also indicate that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein seems to be involved. Intracellular sorting mechanisms are responsible for reduced lysosomal degradation of both ligands after receptor-mediated internalization. Immediately after internalization in rat liver, TRLs are disintegrated, and apoE and LPL are found in endosomal compartments, whereas TRL-derived phospholipids accumulate in the perinuclear region of hepatocytes. Subsequently, substantial amounts of both proteins can be found in purified recycling endosomes, indicating a potential resecretion of these TRL components. Pulse-chase experiments of perfused rat livers with radiolabeled TRLs demonstrated a serum-induced release of internalized apoE and LPL into the perfusate. Analysis of the secreted proteins identified ∼80% of the recycled TRL-derived proteins in the high density lipoprotein fractions. These results provide the first evidence that recycling of TRL-derived apoE and LPL could play an important role in the modulation of lipoproteins in vivo.

The essential role for both receptors in TRL removal in vivo has been demonstrated in gene knockout and gene transfer experiments (Refs. 11Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin.

In contrast to the lysosomal degradation of LDL-derived apoB (14Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4308) Google Scholar), β-VLDL-derived apoE was identified in widely distributed vesicles and showed a slow protein degradation in mouse macrophages (15Tabas I. Lim S. Xu X.X. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Tabas I. Myers J.N. Innerarity T.L. Xu X.X. Arnold K. Boyles J. Maxfield F.R. J.

Tabas I. Jones N.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Delayed transport and degradation of TRL proteins were also observed in hepatoma cells (18Lombardi P. Mulder M. van der Boom H. Frants R.R. Havekes L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26113-26119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Jones A.L. Hradek G.T. Hornick C. Renaud G. Windler E.E. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1151-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In recent studies, we have been able to demonstrate that the altered transport and retarded degradation of internalized TRLs is due to intracellular disintegration and sorting of TRL components in a peripheral cellular compartment. Whereas lipids are directed to lysosomal compartments in human hepatoma cells and fibroblasts, TRL-derived apoE and apoC are recycled back to the cell surface, where resecretion can occur (20Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that the complex intracellular processing of TRL constituents also exists in vivo. An increased intracellular resistance to lysosomal degradation of apoE compared with cholesteryl oleate was demonstrated in C57Bl/6 mice after hepatic uptake of triglyceride-rich emulsion particles (21Rensen P.C. Jong M.C. van Vark L.C. van der Boom H. Hendriks W.L. van Berkel T.J. Biessen E.A. Havekes L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Fazio and co-workers (22Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Swift L.L.

These findings indicate that processing of internalized apoE might occur through distinct endosomal compartments.In this study, we addressed the question of whether recycling of TRL-derived apoE and LPL could play a role in hepatic lipoprotein metabolism in vivo. The disintegration of TRL particles within sorting endosomes could be demonstrated in rat liver, where the TRL lipids can be detected in lysosomal compartments, whereas TRL-derived apoE and LPL are found in a peripheral endosomal compartment. Mobilization and subsequent resecretion of TRL-derived apoE and LPL are induced in the presence of serum. These data suggest that apoE and LPL recycling plays an important role in apoE enrichment of HDL precursors and reutilization of LPL in the space of Disse.DISCUSSIONWe have recently proposed a model of intracellular TRL processing that comprises both recycling and degradation of TRL components (6Heeren J. Beisiegel U. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,20Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrated that significant amounts of125I-apoE-TRL and even more apoE-containing125I-LPL-TRL were not degraded but recycled back to the cell surface. Therefore, the association of LPL with apoE-containing TRLs not only stimulates TRL internalization but also reduces its lysosomal degradation compared with apoE-TRL (Figs. 1 and 2). Although internalization of apoE-containing lipoproteins is thought to be mediated in part by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (2Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), recent experiments have demonstrated that both LRP and the LDL receptor (11Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) are essential for hepatic uptake of TRL lipoproteins. However, the possible involvement of the two lipoprotein receptors in the recycling of apoE is a topic of disagreement (21Rensen P.C. Jong M.C. van Vark L.C. van der Boom H.

Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which might be due to the different “model particles” used in these studies. In agreement with the recycling of apoE in LDLR(−/−) mice (22Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), our results imply that LRP probably participates in the intracellular processing of human TRL-derived apoE and LPL, leading to the recycling of both proteins (Fig. 3). Results presented here indicate that the composition of ligands seems to determine their specific intracellular fate. Thus, the high binding affinities of multivalent ligands on lipoproteins to receptors seem to play an important role in their intracellular metabolism. In support of this hypothesis, the most likely altered ligand binding affinity of apoE3 and E4-enriched β-VLDL has recently been shown to result in different intracellular processing after internalization (33Ji Z.S. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).The main focus of our studies was to characterize TRL processing in vivo. As observed in cell culture experiments (20Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the disintegration of TRLs leads to a peripheral, endosomal distribution of apoE, whereas the majority of lipids seem to accumulate in the perinuclear, prelysosomal compartment (Fig. 4). These findings correlate with the relative resistance of apoE against degradation and the concomitant hydrolysis of cholesterol ester from internalized apoE-cholesterol ester-labeled liposomes in mouse liver (21Rensen P.C. Jong M.C. van Vark L.C. van der Boom H. Hendriks W.L. van Berkel T.J. Biessen E.A. Havekes L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, Fazio et al. (22Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) demonstrated the reutilization of internalized apoE for VLDL assembly in Golgi-enriched fractions. In support of these observations, we detected apoE and LPL in three different endosomal preparations from rat liver during analysis of the intracellular fate of internalized TRL protein components in vivo.First of all, CURL represents the early endosomal sorting compartment and contains internalized radiolabeled LDL or TRL that will subsequently be directed to either RRC or MVB vesicles (30Enrich C. Pol A. Calvo M. Pons M. Jackle S. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). RRC endosomal preparations contain substantial amounts of TRL-derived apoE and LPL (Fig. 5). Although RRC fractions are highly enriched for recycling proteins (e.g. transferrin or LDL receptor), it has been demonstrated that these preparations also contain 5′-nucleotidase and sialyl-transferase activity specific for Golgi secretory vesicles (29Pol A. Ortega D. Enrich C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These findings correlate with the presence of apoE in Golgi-enriched fractions (22Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and indicate that recycling of apoE and LPL via RRC could be mediated in part by Golgi-derived secretory vesicles. In addition, significant amounts of radiolabeled apoE and LPL were found in MVBs, which represent predominantly late endosomes. However, because LRP and LDL receptor (Fig. 5 c) can be found in the MVB fraction, it can be postulated that a significant portion of recycling endosomes is present in this fraction, as also observed by others (29Pol A. Ortega D. Enrich C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These vesicles, in addition to RRC endosomes, are likely to be responsible for apoE and LPL recycling.A number of studies have recently postulated the recycling of internalized apoE in mice hepatocytes (21Rensen P.C. Jong M.C. van Vark L.C. van der Boom H. Hendriks W.L. van Berkel T.J. Biessen E.A. Havekes L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22965-22970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We now provide direct evidence that TRL-derived apoE and LPL are efficiently recycled and resecreted in vivo (Fig. 6 a). Because we have recently described that HDL serves as an extracellular acceptor for the resecretion of apoE (20Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HDL was utilized to stimulate apoE and LPL resecretion after TRL internalization in perfused rat livers (Fig. 6 b). Similar to our observations in vitro (Ref.20Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see also Fig. 2) we determined an ∼60% resecretion of internalized TRL-derived apoE and LPL. Only a minor proportion of radioactivity, representing predominantly LPL, was detected in the VLDL fraction after FPLC and SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 6, b and c). In contrast, the majority of resecreted apoE-derived radioactivity was found in HDL, indicating a reutilization of TRL-derived apoproteins for HDL modulation. These apoE-enriched HDL particles would provide a pool of apoE proteins in the plasma, possibly serving as an apoE donor for intravascular transfer to chylomicrons during lipolysis. Although endogenously synthesized apoE might be able to fulfill this function, recycling of apoE would provide a more readily available pool to promote apoE-mediated chylomicron remnant uptake in the postprandial state.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that significant amounts of internalized TRL-derived apoE and LPL escape the lysosomal pathway and are targeted in a new recycling compartment for resecretion. The resecreted apoE and LPL seem to participate in the modulation of VLDL and HDL in vivo. Because apoE recycling depends on the presence of extracellular HDL, future experiments will have to clarify a potential regulatory role of apoE recycling in HDL-induced cholesterol efflux or HDL catabolism. Triglycerides are transported mainly by two distinct classes of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs),1 the chylomicrons and the very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs). After assembly in the intestine, chylomicrons are transported via lymph into the bloodstream, where they are converted at the endothelial surface to remnant lipoproteins through the catalytic action of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (for review, see Refs. 1Olivecrona G.

Jong M.C. van Vark L.C. van der Boom H. Hendriks W.L. van Berkel T.J. Biessen E.A. Havekes L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, Fazio et al. (22Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) demonstrated the reutilization of internalized apoE for VLDL assembly in Golgi-enriched fractions. In support of these observations, we detected apoE and LPL in three different endosomal preparations from rat liver during analysis of the intracellular fate of internalized TRL protein components in vivo.First of all, CURL represents the early endosomal sorting compartment and contains internalized radiolabeled LDL or TRL that will subsequently be directed to either RRC or MVB vesicles (30Enrich C. Pol A. Calvo M. Pons M. Jackle S. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). RRC endosomal preparations contain substantial amounts of TRL-derived apoE and LPL (Fig. 5). Although RRC fractions are highly enriched for recycling proteins (e.g. transferrin or LDL receptor), it has been demonstrated that these preparations also contain 5′-nucleotidase and sialyl-transferase activity specific for Golgi secretory vesicles (29Pol A. Ortega D. Enrich C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These findings correlate with the presence of apoE in Golgi-enriched fractions (22Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and indicate that recycling of apoE and LPL via RRC could be mediated in part by Golgi-derived secretory vesicles. In addition, significant amounts of radiolabeled apoE and LPL were found in MVBs, which represent predominantly late endosomes. However, because LRP and LDL receptor (Fig. 5 c) can be found in the MVB fraction, it can be postulated that a significant portion of recycling endosomes is present in this fraction, as also observed by others (29Pol A. Ortega D. Enrich C. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These vesicles, in addition to RRC endosomes, are likely to be responsible for apoE and LPL recycling.A number of studies have recently postulated the recycling of internalized apoE in mice hepatocytes (21Rensen P.C. Jong M.C. van Vark L.C. van der Boom H. Hendriks W.L. van Berkel T.J. Biessen E.A. Havekes L.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22965-22970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We now provide direct evidence that TRL-derived apoE and LPL are efficiently recycled and resecreted in vivo (Fig. 6 a). Because we have recently described that HDL serves as an extracellular acceptor for the resecretion of apoE (20Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HDL was utilized to stimulate apoE and LPL resecretion after TRL internalization in perfused rat livers (Fig. 6 b). Similar to our observations in vitro (Ref.20Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see also Fig. 2) we determined an ∼60% resecretion of internalized TRL-derived apoE and LPL. Only a minor proportion of radioactivity, representing predominantly LPL, was detected in the VLDL fraction after FPLC and SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 6, b and c). In contrast, the majority of resecreted apoE-derived radioactivity was found in HDL, indicating a reutilization of TRL-derived apoproteins for HDL modulation. These apoE-enriched HDL particles would provide a pool of apoE proteins in the plasma, possibly serving as an apoE donor for intravascular transfer to chylomicrons during lipolysis. Although endogenously synthesized apoE might be able to fulfill this function, recycling of apoE would provide a more readily available pool to promote apoE-mediated chylomicron remnant uptake in the postprandial state.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that significant amounts of internalized TRL-derived apoE and LPL escape the lysosomal pathway and are targeted in a new recycling compartment for resecretion. The resecreted apoE and LPL seem to participate in the modulation of VLDL and HDL in vivo. Because apoE recycling depends on the presence of extracellular HDL, future experiments will have to clarify a potential regulatory role of apoE recycling in HDL-induced cholesterol efflux or HDL catabolism. We have recently proposed a model of intracellular TRL processing that comprises both recycling and degradation of TRL components (6Heeren J. Beisiegel U. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,20Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrated that significant amounts of125I-apoE-TRL and even more apoE-containing125I-LPL-TRL were not degraded but recycled back to the cell surface. Therefore, the association of LPL with apoE-containing TRLs not only stimulates TRL internalization but also reduces its lysosomal degradation compared with apoE-TRL (Figs. 1 and 2). Although internalization of apoE-containing lipoproteins is thought to be mediated in part by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (2Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), recent experiments have demonstrated that both LRP and the LDL receptor (11Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) are essential for hepatic uptake of TRL lipoproteins. However, the possible involvement of the two lipoprotein receptors in the recycling of apoE is a topic of disagreement (21Rensen P.C. Jong M.C. van Vark L.C. van der Boom H.

Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which might be due to the different “model particles” used in these studies. In agreement with the recycling of apoE in LDLR(−/−) mice (22Fazio S. Linton M.F. Hasty A.H. Swift L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8247-8253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), our results imply that LRP probably participates in the intracellular processing of human TRL-derived apoE and LPL, leading to the recycling of both proteins (Fig. 3). Results presented here indicate that the composition of ligands seems to determine their specific intracellular fate. Thus, the high binding affinities of multivalent ligands on lipoproteins to receptors seem to play an important role in their intracellular metabolism. In support of this hypothesis, the most likely altered ligand binding affinity of apoE3 and E4-enriched β-VLDL has recently been shown to result in different intracellular processing after internalization (33Ji Z.S. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The main focus of our studies was to characterize TRL processing in vivo. As observed in cell culture experiments (20Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the disintegration of TRLs leads to a peripheral, endosomal distribution of apoE, whereas the majority of lipids seem to accumulate in the perinuclear, prelysosomal compartment (Fig. 4).

The present investigations revealed that cyclin D1 induction by transforming Ha-Ras is MEK- and Rac-dependent and requires the PKC isotypes ε, λ, and ζ, but not cPKC-α. This conclusion is based on observations indicating that cyclin D1 induction by transforming Ha-Ras was depressed in a dose-dependent manner by PD98059, a selective inhibitor of the mitogen-activated kinase kinase MEK-1, demonstrating that Ha-Ras employs extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) for signal transmission to the cyclin D1 promoter. Evidence is presented that PKC isotypes ε and ζ, but not λ are required for the Ras-mediated activation of ERKs. Expression of kinase-defective, dominant negative (DN) mutants of nPKC-ε or aPKC-ζ inhibit ERK activation by constitutively active Raf-1. Phosphorylation within the TEY motif and subsequent activation of ERKs by constitutively active MEK-1 was significantly inhibited by DN aPKC-ζ, indicating that aPKC-ζ functions downstream of MEK-1 in the pathway leading to cyclin D1 induction. In contrast, TEY phosphorylation induced by constitutively active MEK-1 was not effected by nPKC-ε, suggesting another position for this kinase within the cascade investigated. Transformation by oncogenic Ras requires activation of several Ras effector pathways which may be PKC-dependent and converge on the cyclin D1 promoter. Therefore, we investigated a role for PKC isotypes in the Ras-Rac-mediated transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1.

Rac-1 also activates c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, which in turn activates the JUN members of the AP-1 transcription factor family.

Whether PKCs are involved in signal transmission from Ras to the cyclin D1 promoter has remained unclear.PKCs represent a family of structurally related serine/threonine protein kinases known to comprise 11 isotypes. The various PKC isoforms are classified into three major subgroups: (i) the classical or conventional PKC isoforms (cPKCs) which are Ca2+- and diacylglycerol-dependent, namely cPKC-α, cPKC-β1, cPKC-β2, and cPKC-γ; (ii) Ca2+-independent, but diacylglycerol-responsive PKC isotypes that have been termed novel PKCs (nPKCs) and comprise the isozymes nPKC-δ, nPKC-ε, and nPKC-θ; and (iii) the so-called atypical PKC isoforms that require neither Ca2+ nor diacylglycerol for activation and currently known to comprise aPKC-λ/ι and aPKC-ζ (16Ron D.

Hellbert K. Kampfer S. Maly K. Villunger A. Spitaler M. Mwanjewe J. Baier-Bitterlich G. Baier G. Grunicke H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence is presented that atypical aPKC-λ and -ζ associate with Cdc42 in a GTP-dependent manner, but use different pathways as Rac for the reorganization of F-actin stress fibers (24Coghlan M.P. Chou M.M. Carpenter C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2880-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).In view of all these reports we investigated whether PKC isoenzymes are playing a functional role in the transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 by transforming Ras. In this paper evidence is presented that transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 by oncogenic Ras is MEK-1-, and Rac-1-dependent and requires aPKC-λ, nPKC-ε, and aPKC-ζ, but not cPKC-α.The data support a tentative model for different signaling pathways in which aPKC-λ acts upstream of Rac-1 and MEK-1, whereas PKC-ζ is required for the activation of ERKs working downstream of MEK-1. Expression of a DN mutant of nPKC-ε inhibits ERK activation by constitutively active (CA) Raf-1, but ERK TEY phosphorylation induced by CA MEK-1 was not effected by nPKC-ε, suggesting another position of nPKC-ε within the cascade investigated.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here demonstrate that in HC11 cells, transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 by transforming L61 Ha-Ras is MEK-1-, and Rac-1-dependent and requires the three PKC isozymes λ, ε and ζ. This conclusion is based on the observation that DN mutants of aPKC-λ, nPKC-ε, and aPKC-ζ inhibit cyclin D1 induction by transforming Ras, whereas CA mutants of these enzyme family were found to activate cyclin D1 by a Ras-independent mechanism (data not shown).PKC-α which is also expressed in HC11 cells, is not employed by Ras for the induction of cyclin D1. Neither DN nor CA versions of cPKC-α were found to affect cyclin D1 induction by Ras.As suggested in our recent publication (23Überall F. Hellbert K. Kampfer S. Maly K. Villunger A. Spitaler M. Mwanjewe J. Baier-Bitterlich G. Baier G. Grunicke H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), aPKC-λ acts upstream of Rac in Ras-mediated reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton. PKC isotypes ε and ζ were found to function downstream of Raf-1 (17Kampfer S. Hellbert K. Villunger A. Doppler W. Baier G. Grunicke H.H. Überall F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4046-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).The Ras-Raf pathways have been shown to be interconnected by PAK (31Chaudhary A. King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Frost J.A. Diaz B. Morrison D.K. Cobb M.H. Marshall M.S. Brugge J.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Activation of PAK by Rac is considered essential for cyclin D1 induction by Rac, whereas activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase or p38 were found to be dispensable for cyclin D1 induction by Rac (11Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). PAK-1 has been shown to phosphorylate and enhance the activity of MEK-1 (32Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Thus, Ras may require the Rac > PAK > MEK pathway for a full activation of ERK 1/2. Overexpression of ERK-1 directly induced cyclin D1 (4Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). All these findings indicate that ERKs are involved in transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 by Ras, as well as by Rac.In our system the MEK-1 specific inhibitor PD098059 significantly inhibited transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 by Ras. PD098059 abrogated transcriptional activation by Ras when both, the AP-1 and the CRE sites were deleted, demonstrating that under these conditions the Ras-Raf-ERK pathway, presumably resulting in activation of an Ets site, is predominant for signal transmission from Ras to the cyclin D1 promoter. This is in agreement with the findings reported by others (4Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), indicating that ERK induction of cyclin D1 was blocked by dominant negative Ets.We previously demonstrated that PKC isozymes ε and ζ act downstream of Raf-1 in the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway activating transcription of c-fos (17Kampfer S. Hellbert K. Villunger A. Doppler W. Baier G. Grunicke H.H. Überall F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4046-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The data presented here further enlarge the assumption that PKC isotypes ε and ζ are involved in the activation of ERKs by Ras and are in agreement with data published by others (20Berra E.

Commun. 1995; 208: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanism by which PKC stimulates ERK is, however, still unclear. It was demonstrated that conventional and novel PKCs (α and ε) are potent activators of c-Raf-1, whereas atypical aPKC-ζ stimulates MEK by a different mechanism (20Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Frutos S. Municio M.M. Sanchez P. Sanz L. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6157-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 38Schönwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar).DN PKC-ζ strongly inhibits phosphorylation and activation of ERK 1/2 by CA MEK-1, indicating that aPKC-ζ functions downstream of MEK-1. This assumption is further strengthened by the fact that aPKC-ζ does not physically interact with MEK-1 in pull-down experiments (data not shown). The mechanism by which nPKC-ε and aPKC-ζ regulate ERK activation remains to be elucidated. A direct PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of ERKs could be excluded. Furthermore, no evidence for an inhibition of MAP kinase phosphatases by PKC isotypes could be detected (not shown).Another model which is presently under investigation, concerns a PKC-regulated interaction with scaffold proteins which may be essential for the selective activation of ERKs (40Leinweber B.D.

Doppler W. Baier G. Grunicke H.H. Überall F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4046-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Evidence for a functional role of c-fos in the transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1 has been published (14Brown J.R. Nigh E. Lee R.J. Ye H. Thompson M.A. Saudou F. Pestell R.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol.

Thus, it may appear that the findings presented here simply reflect a requirement for c-fosin the transcriptional activation of cyclin D1, but the following considerations, however, suggest that this is not the case.The cyclin D1 promoter contains two sites that could mediate a direct induction by c-Fos: a classical AP-1 site (at approximately −950) and a CRE/ATF site at approximately −60 (4Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 28Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1295-1304PubMed Google Scholar). Both sites have been shown to bind c-Fos containing heterodimers (4Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 14Brown J.R. Nigh E. Lee R.J. Ye H. Thompson M.A. Saudou F. Pestell R.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5609-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).These findings were confirmed by us in HC11 cells where stimulation of the Ras pathway by epidermal growth factor was shown to result in binding of c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers to both the AP-1 and the CRE sites (not shown). The observation that deletion of both the AP-1 and the CRE sites neither depressed cyclin D1 induction by Ras nor abolished the PKC dependence of Ras-mediated transcriptional activation, suggests that transcriptional induction of c-fos is not sufficient for cyclin D1 induction by oncogenic Ha-Ras. Candidates for additional sites are Ets-binding domains and E2F sites. Multiple putative Ets-binding sites can be detected within the cyclin D1 promoter. Ets sites essential for Ras-mediated cyclin D1 induction have been located at position −778 (6Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar) and within the proximal promoter region (4Albanese C. Johnson J. Watanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23589-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Mutation of a E2F site located in a truncated cyclin D1 promoter lacking the sequence upstream of position −163 strongly reduced the responsiveness to transcriptional activation by Neu (46Lee R.J. Albanese C. Fu M. D'Amico M. Lin B. Watanabe G. Haines III, G.K. Siegel P.M. Hung M.C. Yarden Y. Horowitz J.M. Muller W.J. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 672-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).In agreement with a previous publication (11Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), it was also found that transforming Ha-Ras employs the Ras-homology protein Rac-1 for transcriptional activation of cyclin D1. DN N17-Rac-1 blocked Ras-mediated induction of cyclin D1 and CA V12-Rac activated transcription of cyclin D1 in the absence of transforming Ras. Induction of cyclin D1 by V12-Rac is depressed by DN mutants of nPKC-ε and aPKC-ζ, but not, however, by DN aPKC-λ, indicating that PKC isotypes ε and ζ act downstream of Rac. The inhibitory effect of DN aPKC-λ, however, was overcome by V12-Rac, whereas V12-Rac had no effect on the suppression of Ras-mediated cyclin D1 induction by DN PKC isoforms ε and ζ. Therefore, it can be concluded that aPKC-λ acts upstream of Rac-1, whereas PKC isozymes ε and ζ function downstream of Rac-1.The ability of Rac-1 to bind and activate p21-activated kinase p65 PAK was shown to correlate with its ability for transcriptional activation of the cyclin D1 promoter (11Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that signals from Ras and Rac converge on PAK and evidence for a signaling pathway Ras > Rac > PAK has been presented (47Tang Y., Yu, J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ras activates transcription of cyclin D1 predominantly via Rac.If this is correct, Ras and Rac should activate cyclin D1 transcription through the same promoter elements. This, however, was not found to be the case. Since Ras could activate the mutated promoter as efficient as the wild type promoter we have suggested that under these conditions signal transmission from Ras to the cyclin D1 promoter involves other sites.In HC11 cells, Rac-1 partially activates transcription of cyclin D1 through AP-1 and CRE sites. In accordance with findings by others (31Chaudhary A. King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Frost J.A. Diaz B. Morrison D.K. Cobb M.H. Marshall M.S. Brugge J.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), our data suggest that Rac-1 additionally is involved in the pathway from Ras to the cyclin D1 promoter via the Ras > Raf > ERK cascade, presumably by activating p65 PAK-1 (32Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The recent suggestion that PAK-3 could stimulate Raf-1 activity by directly phosphorylating Ser-338 through a Ras-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Cdc42-dependent pathway has attracted much attention (48Chiloeches A. Mason C.S. Marais R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2423-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, in HC11 cells, this pathway seems to be of minor importance, as the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY 294002 did not interfere with cyclin D1 induction by Ras (not shown).In addition to these sites, binding elements for several other transcription factors have been identified within the cyclin D1 promoter, comprising sites for Sp1, TCF/LEF-1, NF-κB, E2F, Ets, and STAT5 (6Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3236) Google Scholar, 7Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C. Downward J. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5785-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological function of PKC isotypes involved in pathways corresponding with these additionally described factors remains to be elucidated.The observations described in this paper allow us to draw novel and exiting models for the regulation of cyclin D1 by PKCs, however, they also raise many questions that need to be addressed. For example, how can we explain that aPKC-ζ is involved in signal transmission from Ras to cyclin D1 without direct interaction of MEK-1 and/or phosphorylation events necessary for ERK activation. Genetic models, including conditional PKC knock-out mice, will give us more information concerning the biological functions of the PKC isotypes found in these pathways. Experiments in this direction are under way. Together with findings from others (50Yu Q. Geng Y. Sicinski P. Nature. 2001; 411: 1017-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), explaining the absolute dependence on cyclin D1 from Neu- and Ras-mediated malignant transformation in mammary epithelial cells, intervention of breast cancer with PKC isotype-specific inhibitors might be a promising therapeutical approach. Transformation by oncogenic Ras requires activation of several Ras effectors which, in turn, stimulate different signaling pathways. These Ras effectors include Raf, Ral-GDS, PI 3-kinase, and Rac-1 (1Gille H. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22033-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Activation of Rac-1 by oncogenic Ras is mediated by PI 3-kinase1-dependent (2Akasaki T. Koga H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18055-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubM"

However, whether this protein is a direct in vivo substrate for the insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase and whether the tyrosine phosphorylation plays a role in insulin signaling remain to be established. Here we show that the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the GAP-associated protein, now identified as p62dok, is inhibited by Grb10, an adaptor protein that binds directly to the kinase domain of the IR, both in vitro and in cells. Replacing Tyr362 and Tyr398 with phenylalanine greatly decreased the IR-catalyzed p62dok tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro, suggesting that these two residues are the major IR-mediated phosphorylation sites. However, mutations at Tyr362 and Tyr398 only partially blocked insulin-stimulated p62dok tyrosine phosphorylation in cells, indicating that p62dok is also a target for other cellular tyrosine kinase(s) in addition to the IR. Replacing Tyr362 with phenylalanine abolished the interaction between p62dok and Nck. Mutations at Tyr362/398 of p62dok disrupted the interaction between p62dokand GAP and decreased the inhibitory effect of p62dok on the insulin-stimulated activation of Ras and Akt, but not mitogen-activated protein kinase. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of p62dok on Akt phosphorylation could be blocked by coexpression of a constitutively active Ras. Taken together, our findings indicate that p62dok is a direct substrate for the IR tyrosine kinase and that phosphorylation at Tyr362 and Tyr398 plays an essential role for p62dok to interact with its effectors and negatively regulate the insulin signaling pathway.

Overexpression of p62dok has been shown to inhibit Ras activity in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and B cell antigen receptor-mediated c-fos promoter activation in an immature B cell line (16Yoshida K. Yamashita Y. Miyazato A. Ohya K. Kitanaka A. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Yamanaka T. Ozawa K. Mano H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24945-24952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that p62dok may play a negative role in Ras signaling. It has been shown that insulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of p62dok (1White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar); however, the sites of phosphorylation and the physiological roles of p62dok in insulin signal transduction remain largely unknown. It is of interest to note that the overall structure of p62dok is similar to that of the IRS proteins (1White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of p62dok in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the IR (CHO/IR cells) has been shown to stimulate Ras membrane localization (17Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, although these findings suggest that p62dok may play a role in insulin signaling, overexpression of p62dok has been shown to have little effect, if any, on insulin-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (17Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Inagaki K. Tsuda M. Fukunaga K. Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Shii K. Yamanashi Y. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR cellular substrates, binding of insulin to its receptor also leads to the autophosphorylation of the IR on at least six tyrosine residues, including Tyr1158, Tyr1162, and Tyr1163 in the activation domain. This phosphorylation of the receptor leads to the generation of docking sites for binding of adaptor proteins such as Shc and Grb2, which allows constitutive association with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS and subsequent activation of Ras. Through an interaction with Raf-1, Ras activates the MAP kinase kinases MEK1 and MEK2, and in turn the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (2Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, it has become clear that Ras also controls the activity of other downstream effectors in addition to Raf-1. Ras has been shown to interact with and stimulate the activity of the catalytic p110 subunit of different isoforms of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (18Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of the dominant negative N17 Ras mutant inhibits insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor-stimulated Akt activation (19Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazalauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Ras is an upstream activator of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Grb10 is a pleckstrin homology and Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein that binds to the autophosphorylated IR (20Liu F. Roth R.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that Grb10 binds to autophosphorylated tyrosine residues in the activation loop of the IR (21O'Neill T.J. Rose T.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Dong L.Q. Farris S. Christal J. Liu F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, a human Grb10 isoform with a deletion in the pleckstrin homology domain inhibits insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the 60-kDa GAP-associated protein when overexpressed in CHO/IR cells (23Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, the identity of this GAP-associated protein and the mechanism by which Grb10 inhibited its tyrosine phosphorylation remained unknown. Very recently, it has been shown that Grb10 inhibits the catalytic activity of the IR in vitro (24Stein E.G. Gustafson T.A. Hubbard S.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the binding of Grb10 to the activation domain of the IR blocks the ability of the receptor to phosphorylate its exogenous substrates. In the present study, we investigated the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the 60-kDa GAP-associated protein. We provide evidence that this 60-kDa GAP-associated protein is in fact p62dok. In addition, we show that p62dok is a direct substrate of the IR with phosphorylation occurring mainly at tyrosine residues 362 and 398. Replacing tyrosine residues of p62dok at 362 and 398 with phenylalanine inhibited the interaction between p62dok and GAP. We also found that overexpression of wild-type p62dok in CHO/IR cells inhibited insulin-stimulated activation of Ras, MAP kinase, and Akt. Furthermore, inhibition of Ras and Akt could be rescued by mutating 362 and 398 of p62dok. Taken together, our findings suggest that the IR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p62dokplays important and specific roles in regulating the insulin-mediated MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase pathways downstream of Ras.

The cDNA encoding full-length p62dok was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the EcoRI/EcoRV sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA.3.1A (Invitrogen) using the primers 5′-CGGAATTCATGGACGGAGCAGTGATGGAA-3′(EcoRI) and 5′-GGGATATCCCTCTGACTT-3′(EcoRV), with the added restriction sites underlined. Full-length wild-type and mutants of p62dok (minus the last six amino acids) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pET21a to generate His-tagged p62dok proteins using the forward and reverse primers 5′-GCGAATTCGGAGCGTGATGGAAGGG-3′ (EcoRI) and 5′-CTGCGTCGACCCCAGTCTTGTCAGT-3′ (SalI) with the added restriction sites underlined. Various truncations of p62dok were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the previously described forward primer (EcoRI) and the reverse primers ΔC1 (5′-CTGCGTCGACTGGGGCCAGGCCCTC-3′;SalI); ΔC2 (5′-CTGCGTCGACCTCTTTGGGGTCTGTCAG-3′; SalI), ΔC3 (5′-CTGCGTCGACTCCCTCTCCTGCCTGAG-3′; SalI), and ΔC4 (5′-CTGCGTCGACCTCCCCTTCATGGGA-3′;SalI).

Point mutants of p62dok were generated by single-stranded site-directed mutagenesis according to the protocol as described by Kunkel et al. (27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) using customized primers. All site-directed mutagenesis products were confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. BL21(DE3) or DH5α cells containing plasmids encoding His-tagged full-length or various truncated mutants of p62dok, His-Akt, GST-Grb10-C, or GST-Raf-RBD were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin. Expression of proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 3.5 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × gfor 10 min and lysed in Buffer A for 30 min at 4 °C. The solution was sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 15 min. The proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) beads or glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma). CHO/IR and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were used in all experiments. Stable CHO cell lines overexpressing kinase-defective (IRKD) and the tyrosine phosphorylation site mutant (IRY1162F/Y1163F) of the IR were generous gifts of Dr. Richard A. Roth (28Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed in Buffer B. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the clarified supernatant was used for either immunoprecipitation or Western blot analysis. Proteins in cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by incubation with the primary antibody conjugated to either protein G- or protein A-Sepharose beads for 6–18 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold Buffer C. For immunoblot analysis, cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10–15% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and bound proteins were detected by blotting with primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Wild-type or mutants of the IR were purified by incubation of cell lysates with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose (E. Laboratories) at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing with Buffer C, the IR attached to the beads was activated in vitro by incubation at room temperature for 30 min with kinase buffer (Buffer D). Activated IR was eluted using 0.3 m N-acetylglucosamine (Sigma) and used immediately in kinase assays. His-tagged p62dok bound to Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads was washed twice with ice-cold Buffer C and once with kinase reaction buffer (Buffer E). Kinase assays were carried out by incubation of p62dok with Buffer E plus 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by washing twice with ice-cold Buffer C followed by the addition of SDS-sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 3 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, and tyrosine phosphorylation of p62dok was detected by autoradiography. The protein level of p62dok was determined by Coomassie staining. Wild-type or mutants of p62dok were phosphorylated by purified and activated IR in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described above. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The 32P-labeled bands corresponding to p62dok were excised. The protein samples were trypsin treated, desalted, and separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography as described previously (29Liu F. Roth R.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HA-tagged Ras was coexpressed in CHO/IR or human embryonic kidney 293 cells together with wild-type or mutant p62dok. Cells were left untreated or treated with insulin and lysed. Cell lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 4 h with bacterially expressed GST-Raf-RBD fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After extensive washing with ice-cold Buffer C, bound protein was eluted by heating in SDS-sample buffer for 3 min at 95 °C. The activated Ras pulled down by the GST-Raf-RBD protein was separated by SDS-PAGE using a 15% polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by Western blot using antibody to the HA tag. FLAG-tagged Akt was overexpressed alone or with wild-type or mutant p62dok in CHO/IR cells. Cells were serum starved, treated with insulin or not treated, lysed, and Akt immunoprecipitated using antibody to the tag. Bound Akt was washed twice with ice-cold Buffer C and twice with Buffer F. Akt was then incubated in Buffer F containing 5 μm cold ATP, 30 μm peptide substrate (GRPRTSSFAEG), and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/sample for 30 min at 30 °C. Akt activity was determined by scintillation counting. To study the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p62dok, we transiently transfected CHO/IR cells with plasmid encoding Myc-tagged p62dok and stimulated the cells with insulin. Insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p62dok could be detected as early as 15 s after treatment (Fig. 1 A,upper panel). Similar results were also observed for endogenous p62dok in CHO/IR cells (data not shown). The rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of p62dok in response to insulin stimulation suggested that the protein might be a direct substrate for the IR kinase in cells. To test this idea further, we examined the in vitro phosphorylation of p62dokin the presence of wild-type and two mutants of the IR (IRKD and IRY1162F/Y1163F) (28Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). We found that p62dok was readily phosphorylated in vitro by the wild-type IR, but not by the kinase-defective IRKD or tyrosine phosphorylation site mutant IRY1162F/Y1163F (Fig.1 B, upper panel, lanes 1–3). Under the same conditions, no tyrosine phosphorylation of the control protein Akt (Fig. 1 B, upper panel, lanes 4–6) or Grb10 (30Langlais P. Dong L.Q. Hu D. Liu F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2895-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was observed by activated IR in vitro. To provide additional evidence that p62dok is a direct substrate for the IR, we examined the effect of Grb10 on the tyrosine phosphorylation of p62dok by the IR in vitro. Because Grb10 binds to the kinase domain of the IR (21O'Neill T.J. Rose T.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22506-22513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Dong L.Q. Farris S. Christal J. Liu F. Mol.

A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we postulated that Grb10 might prevent p62doktyrosine phosphorylation by blocking the kinase activity of the IR. To test this idea, we expressed the carboxyl terminus of Grb10 (residues 369–548 of hGrb10α (23Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)) in bacterial cells as a GST fusion protein and examined the effect of the recombinant protein on the tyrosine phosphorylation of p62dok by the IR tyrosine kinasein vitro. The carboxyl terminus of Grb10 (Grb10-C) has previously been shown to mediate the binding of the protein to the tyrosine-phosphorylated IR (21O'Neill T.J. Rose T.W. Pillay T.S. Hotta K. Olefsky J.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6860-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, incubation of p62dok with activated IR in vitro resulted in substantial tyrosine phosphorylation of p62dok (upper panel, lane 3). The tyrosine phosphorylation of p62dok was inhibited competitively with increasing concentrations of the carboxyl terminus of Grb10 (Fig. 2 A,upper panel, lanes 4–7). This inhibition was specific, and GST protein alone had no effect on p62doktyrosine phosphorylation with similar assay conditions (Fig.2 A, upper panel, lane 1). To verify that p62dok is a direct substrate for the IRin vivo, we tested p62dok tyrosine phosphorylation in CHO/IR cells in the presence of increasing amounts of Grb10. Treatment of cells with insulin led to substantial p62dok tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B,top panel, lane 1). The insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited competitively by increasing the expression of Grb10 (Fig. 2 B, top panel,lanes 2–5). This inhibition was most likely the result of a direct binding of Grb10 to the IR kinase domain because little inhibition was observed in cells overexpressing the SH2 domain mutant of Grb10 (Fig. 2 B, top panel, lane 5 versus lane 6), which has previously been shown to be unable to bind to the tyrosine-phosphorylated IR in CHO/IR cells (30Langlais P. Dong L.Q. Hu D. Liu F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2895-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Having found p62dok as a direct substrate for the IR, we next attempted to identify the IR-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation site(s) of p62dok. To do this, we first tried to identify the regions on p62dok which contained potential IR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Full-length and several truncation mutants of p62dok were expressed in Escherichia coli as His-tagged proteins (Fig.3 A). The bacterially expressed p62dok proteins were purified using Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads, and their phosphorylation was determined in the presence of purified, activated IR and [γ-32P]ATP. In agreement with our earlier findings (Figs. 1 B and 2 A), full-length p62dokwas phosphorylated readily by the IR tyrosine kinase (Fig.3 B, upper panel, lane 1). Deletion of the carboxyl terminus of p62dok (residues 372–481, p62dokΔC1) led to a decrease in the IR-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein (Fig. 3 B, upper panel, lane 2 versus lane 1). Further deletions greatly decreased or completely abolished p62doktyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, upper panel,lanes 3–5 (longer exposure of the film revealed a small but notable phosphorylation of p62dokΔC2 (Fig.3 C, ΔC2 and data not shown)). These findings suggested that the major IR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation site(s) were located between residues 359 and 475 of p62dok. To test this further, the in vitro phosphorylated wild-type and two truncation fragments (ΔC1 and ΔC2) of p62dok (Fig.3 A) were analyzed by phosphopeptide mapping. Two major phosphopeptides, a and b, were observed for wild-type p62dok (Fig. 3 C, WT). Deletion of residues 372–475 of p62dok led to the loss of phosphopeptide b (Fig. 3 C, ΔC1), suggesting that one of the major phosphorylation sites lay between amino acid residues 372 and 475 of p62dok. Phosphopeptide mapping of p62dokΔC1 also revealed the presence of a new phosphopeptide (Fig. 3 C, ΔC1, phosphopeptide c). This phosphopeptide had a lower phosphorylation stoichiometry and was also observed with the other truncation and a point mutant of p62dok (Fig. 3C, ΔC2 and Y362F). The identity of this phosphopeptide is unknown but may have resulted from compensatory phosphorylation caused by a conformational change induced by truncating or mutating the protein. Further deletion of the carboxyl terminus of p62dok (p62dokΔC2) resulted in the loss of both phosphopeptides a and b (Fig. 3 C, ΔC2), indicating that the other major IR-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation site(s) was located between residues 359 and 371. Amino acid sequence analysis of p62dok revealed the presence of a single tyrosine residue (Tyr362) between residues 359 and 371. To identify whether tyrosine 362 was an IR-catalyzed phosphorylation site, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis and changed this residue to phenylalanine. p62dok/Y362F was expressed in bacterial cells as a His-tagged protein, purified by Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads, and phosphorylated in vitro by purified IR tyrosine kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. We found that a mutation at Tyr362 significantly decreased IR-catalyzed p62dok tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.4 A, upper panel). Phosphopeptide analysis revealed that mutation of Tyr362 to phenylalanine resulted in a loss of phosphopeptide a (Fig.3 C, Y362F). These findings confirmed Tyr362 as one of the major IR-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation sites in p62dok. The finding that mutation at Tyr362 decreased, but did not completely abolish, the IR-catalyzed p62dok tyrosine phosphorylation suggested"
https://openalex.org/W2006563243,"Translational activation in oocytes and embryos is often regulated via increases in poly(A) length. Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB), and poly(A) polymerase (PAP) have each been implicated in cytoplasmic polyadenylation in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation activity first appears in vertebrate oocytes during meiotic maturation. Data presented here shows that complexes containing both CPSF and CPEB are present in extracts of X. laevis oocytes prepared before or after meiotic maturation. Assessment of a variety of RNA sequences as polyadenylation substrates indicates that the sequence specificity of polyadenylation in egg extracts is comparable to that observed with highly purified mammalian CPSF and recombinant PAP. The two in vitro systems exhibit a sequence specificity that is similar, but not identical, to that observed in vivo, as assessed by injection of the same RNAs into the oocyte. These findings imply that CPSFs intrinsic RNA sequence preferences are sufficient to account for the specificity of cytoplasmic polyadenylation of some mRNAs. We discuss the hypothesis that CPSF is required for all polyadenylation reactions, but that the polyadenylation of some mRNAs may require additional factors such as CPEB. To test the consequences of PAP binding to mRNAs in vivo, PAP was tethered to a reporter mRNA in resting oocytes using MS2 coat protein. Tethered PAP catalyzed polyadenylation and stimulated translation approximately 40-fold; stimulation was exclusively cis-acting, but was independent of a CPE and AAUAAA. Both polyadenylation and translational stimulation required PAPs catalytic core, but did not require the putative CPSF interaction domain of PAP. These results demonstrate that premature recruitment of PAP can cause precocious polyadenylation and translational stimulation in the resting oocyte, and can be interpreted to suggest that the role of other factors is to deliver PAP to the mRNA."

Recent genetic studies have identified the gene pel/sagAthat is required for β-hemolysis in Streptococcus pyogenes(7Betschel S. Borgia S. Barg N. Low D.E. Azavedo J. Infect.

This gene is present in group A, C, and G but not group B streptococci (10Eberhard T.H. Sledjeski D.D. Boyle M.D.P. 100th General Meeting American Society of Microbiology, Los Angeles, California, May, 2000. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3212-3219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pel/sagA gene encodes a 53-amino acid polypeptide. Based on genetic evidence, this polypeptide is predicted to contain a 17-amino acid leader sequence that would be processed to yield a 36-amino acid polypeptide (7Betschel S. Borgia S. Barg N. Low D.E. Azavedo J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Li Z. Sledjeski D. Kreikemeyer B. Podbielski A. Boyle M.D.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6019-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of mutants and complementation experiments using nonhemolytic Lactococcus isolates support the conclusion that the polypeptide encoded by the pel/sagA gene is indeed a key constituent of streptococcal SLS (9Nizet V. Beall B. Bast D.J. Datta V. Kilburn L. Low D.E. Azavedo J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4245-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In this study we have generated monospecific polyclonal antibodies to two peptide sequences present in the Pel /SagA primary sequence and have found that the antibody to a C-terminal peptide neutralizes hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes mediated by SLS isolated from opacity factor-positive and -negative S. pyogenesisolates of various M serotypes. The availability of this antibody now enables the study of a defined streptococcal hemolysin and analysis of its mode of action in mediating red cell hemolysis. S. pyogenesstrains were grown in Todd-Hewitt yeast broth supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract at 37 °C with 10% CO2. Isotonic veronal-buffered saline (VBS), pH 7.4, containing 0.1% gelatin (Mann Research Labs, New York) (VBS gel) was prepared as described (13Rapp H.J. Borsos T. Molecular Basis of Complement Action. Meredith Corp., New York1970Google Scholar). Glucose-monohydrate was obtained from Baker Chemical Co. (Philadelphia, PA), sucrose (ultracentrifuge grade) was obtained from Schwarz-Mann (Orangeburg, NY), and raffinose pentahydrate was obtained from (Vega Chemicals, Tucson, AZ). All sugar solutions were 0.3 m in water. Trypan blue (Matheson, Coleman, and Bell, Norwood, OH) was prepared as a stock solution in distilled water at 1.6 mm. Papain was obtained from Sigma. A commercial source of SLS (Sigma) was used for certain experiments. This preparation was derived from S. pyogenesand contains the SLS peptide with an RNA core. Sheep red blood cells (Pel Freez Biologicals, Rodgers, AR) were collected and washed as described in Ref. 13Rapp H.J. Borsos T. Molecular Basis of Complement Action. Meredith Corp., New York1970Google Scholar. Red cells were standardized to a concentration of 1.5 × 108/ml based on their hemoglobin content as described previously (13Rapp H.J. Borsos T. Molecular Basis of Complement Action. Meredith Corp., New York1970Google Scholar). An aliquot of 100 μl of culture supernatant or a dilution of a commercial SLS preparation was added to a test tube containing a fixed amount of red blood cells (1.5 × 107 cells) in a final volume of 1.5 ml VBS gel. The samples were incubated at the indicated temperature. The extent of hemolysis was determined by measuring the hemoglobin released into the supernatants at A541 following pelleting of unlysed erythrocytes by centrifugation at 3000 × gfor 5 min. This basic hemolytic assay was modified to include binding of SLS at different temperatures and washing to remove unbound SLS to generate a SLS-bound erythrocyte intermediate. For incubation studies using trypan blue, the hemolysin release in the supernatant could not be quantified because of interference from the dye. Consequently, the number of unlysed cells was determined following washing and lysis of the cell pellet with 1.5 ml of H2O and determining the concentration of hemoglobin at A541. Analysis of the effect of papain treatment of erythrocytes to which SLS was then bound on subsequent hemolytic events was performed as described in the text. In related experiments erythrocytes with SLS bound were incubated in isotonic solutions of different sugars to determine the effect of molecules of varying Stokes radius on SLS-mediated hemolysis. This experimental approach has previously been used to identify differences in the pore size of complement channels present in erythrocyte membranes as a function of C8:C9 ratios (14Boyle M.D.P. Gee A.P. Boros T. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 77-82PubMed Google Scholar). A synthetic C-terminal peptide (N-TGSGNSQGGSGSYTPGK-C) that corresponded to amino acids 37–53 of the predicted pel ORF from S. pyogenes was synthesized by Eurogentec (Herstal, Belgium). It was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits following standard immunization protocols. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were run to monitor the generation of specific antibodies to the C-terminal synthetic peptide. IgG was purified from the final bleed and further affinity-purified on a peptide-Sepharose affinity column. The second peptide (N-CCCCCTTCCFSIA-C) corresponded to amino acids 24–36 of the predicted pel ORF from S. pyogenesand was synthesized by Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). Antibodies to the N-terminal peptide were produced as described for the C-terminal peptide (Eurogentec, Herstal, Belgium). For inhibition experiments culture supernatants or a commercial SLS preparation was preincubated with the indicated concentration of antibody for 10 min at 37 °C, before the mixture was added to erythrocytes and the hemolytic assay was performed as described above. SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis was carried out using the Ciphergen protein chip system (Ciphergen, Palo Alto, CA) as described in Ref. 15Boyle M.D.P. Romer T.G. Meeker A.K. Sledjeski D. J. Microb. Methods. 2001; 46: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar. For all of the studies described, SELDI analysis was performed using a hydrophobic H4 protein chip CiphergenTM. The H4 chip contains a long chain aliphatic surface that binds proteins by reverse phase interaction. Three to five microliters of sample diluted in distilled water were applied to a spot on an H4 chip and allowed to air dry and then washed with 3 μl of H2O and allowed to dry. To the dry spot, 0.5 μl of an energy absorbing molecule (EAM) was added. The EAM consisted of a saturated solution of 3.5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic or sinapinic acid (Sigma), 50% acetonitrile, and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. EAM was added and allowed to air dry. Once dry, a second application of EAM solution was added and allowed to crystallize. The sample was transferred to the Ciphergen SELDI reader and analyzed following desorption of bound proteins by short intense probes from an N2 320-nm UV laser. The profile of bound proteins was determined by time of flight in a mass spectrometer. As noted in the introduction, the precise chemical nature of SLS is unknown. In this study we have used a commercially available, functionally active form of the hemolysin derived from S. pyogenes. This preparation (lot 0274 4112) contained 2.9% protein by weight, and the balance of the material was core RNA and salt. The majority of the sample was insoluble in water at 4 °C; however, the soluble fraction post-centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min) contained >90% of the hemolytic activity (data not shown). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and silver staining of the hemolytically active soluble SLS failed to identify any polypeptide band. (Note that a 1:10,000 dilution of this preparation could completely lyse 1.5 × 107 sheep erythrocytes within 30 min at 37 °C.) An aliquot of the soluble hemolysin preparation was subjected to analysis by SELDI-TOF (Ciphergen) using an H4 protein chip. The H4 chip contains a long chain aliphatic surface that binds proteins by reverse phase interactions. Analysis of soluble fraction containing the hemolysin revealed the presence of a predominant 4,702 ± 20-Da peak (Fig.1, top panel), which was removed after incubation with 0.5 ml of packed sheep erythrocytes on ice (Fig. 1, bottom panel). The erythrocyte preparation used for absorption lysed completely when subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. In addition to its hemolytic potential, a second well described property of SLS is the ability of the vital dye trypan blue to inhibit hemolysis (1Ginsburg I. Montie T.C. Kadis S. Ajl S.J. Microbial Toxins: Bacterial Protein Toxins. 3. Academic Press, New York1972: 100-171Google Scholar, 2Ginsburg I. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. 1999; 107: 1051-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effects of trypan blue on the SLS preparation, red cells were incubated in the presence or absence of differing concentrations of trypan blue and a SLS dose that resulted in ∼50% end point hemolysis in the absence of any inhibitor. Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, unlysed cells were pelleted and washed to remove any released hemoglobin and trypan blue. The remaining intact cells were lysed by addition of water and the number of intact erythrocytes determined. By comparing the quantity of hemoglobin present in lysates of untreated cells, cells treated with SLS alone or cells treated with SLS and trypan blue, the effect of the dye on hemolysis was determined. In agreement with previous reports (1Ginsburg I. Montie T.C. Kadis S. Ajl S.J. Microbial Toxins: Bacterial Protein Toxins. 3. Academic Press, New York1972: 100-171Google Scholar, 2Ginsburg I. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. 1999; 107: 1051-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), trypan blue acted as a dose-dependent inhibitor of SLS-mediated hemolysis (data not shown). The SLS preparation was further characterized using an immunological approach. Antibodies generated to synthetic peptides from the predicted processed form of the pel ORF were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two antibody preparations were evaluated. One antibody was generated to an N-terminal synthetic peptide of the predicted processed pel gene product, and the second was generate to a predicted C-terminal synthetic peptide. Dilutions of the affinity-purified N-terminal and C-terminal antibodies were tested for their ability to inhibit SLS-mediated hemolysis of sheep red blood cells. The C-terminal antibody was able to inhibit SLS-mediated hemolysis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2). Neither the N-terminal antibody nor normal rabbit serum control was able to neutralize the hemolytic effects of SLS. The failure of the N-terminal peptide antibody to inhibit SLS-mediated hemolysis might relate to the failure of the peptide immunogen to adopt the three-dimensional configuration of the native active SLS molecule or may show that this region of the protein is not involved in the hemolytic function of the SLS complex. The finding that an affinity-purified antibody to a predicted C-terminal synthetic peptide of the pel gene product could inhibit SLS-mediated hemolysis indicated that this C-terminal epitope is present in the active molecule. The C-terminal antibody was also found to be capable of neutralizing the hemolysin present in culture supernatants of different M serotypes of S. pyogenes (Fig. 3). These studies further support the conclusion that the oxygen-stable hemolysin of streptococci involves the product of the pel/sagA gene. The next series of experiments were designed to analyze the mechanism of hemolysis mediated by SLS. In the initial experiments, differing concentrations of SLS were added to a fixed number of red cells (1.5 × 107), and the kinetics of lysis were analyzed. After a short lag period hemolysis occurred and reached an end point within 30–45 min at 37 °C (Fig.4 A). At high SLS concentrations, 100% of the erythrocytes could be lysed. To determine the dose-dependent characteristics of SLS-mediated hemolysis, a fixed number of erythrocytes (1.5 × 107) were incubated with differing concentrations of SLS, and the extent of hemolysis was determined following 60 min of incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 4 B). The dose response was concave to the abscissa, consistent with a one-hit mechanism of SLS-mediate hemolysis, i.e. one functional SLS molecule being necessary and sufficient to lyse one erythrocyte. To confirm the one-hit nature of SLS-mediated hemolysis, the effect of varying the number of target erythrocytes on the extent of hemolysis mediated by a fixed concentration of SLS was determined. The average number of lytic sites/cell (Z) was calculated using the Poisson transformation: Z = −ln (1 - Y) where Y is the fraction of cells lysed. The average number of lytic sites/cell was directly proportional to the SLS concentration for each cell concentration tested. Furthermore, the average number of lytic sites/cell varied proportionally with cell number (Fig.4 C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that SLS-mediated hemolysis follows the predictions for a one-hit mechanism of hemolysis,i.e. one molecule of the SLS complex is necessary and sufficient to lyse one red blood cell. This enables a sensitive assay for functional SLS activity in any sample to be performed. Several bacterial toxins have been shown to act through a multi-step, temperature-dependent mechanism (16Drobniewski F.A. Ellar D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3060-3067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Honda T. Ni Y. Miwatani T. Adachi T. Kim J. Can. J.

Dis. 1991; 164: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Ginsburg I. Bentwich L. Harris T.N. J. Exp. Med. 1965; 121: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Duncan J.L. Mason L. Infect. Immun. 1976; 14: 77-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the effect of temperature on SLS-mediated hemolysis was determined. Differing concentrations of SLS were incubated with sheep erythrocytes at 17, 20, 24, and 37 °C, and the kinetics of hemolysis were measured (Fig. 5). In agreement with previous studies using rabbit erythrocytes (19Ginsburg I. Bentwich L. Harris T.N. J. Exp. Med. 1965; 121: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), SLS-mediated hemolysis was time-dependent. In addition, evidence for a critical temperature-dependent step was apparent (Fig. 5). At 17 °C no hemolysis was seen (Fig. 5 A); however, as the temperature was increased (Fig. 5, B–D), hemolysis was observed over time. For each SLS concentration a similar end point was reached at each temperature above 23 °C. Below 23 °C no lysis occurred for any SLS concentration (data not shown). The time required for maximal lysis was dependent on the temperature of the reaction. The lag time before any hemolysis was detected correlated with temperature. At lower temperatures, the lag period was prolonged (compare the 1:800 dilutions of SLS in Fig. 5, B and D). A similar pattern of temperature dependence has previously been described for complement-mediated hemolysis (21Okada M. Boyle M.D.P. Boros T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In that system, a critical temperature was also identified that was required to enable the membrane attack complex to insert into erythrocyte membrane as well as a subsequent temperature-dependent reaction that influenced the rate of hemolysis (21Okada M. Boyle M.D.P. Boros T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Previous studies of complement-mediated hemolysis have identified a series of intermediate steps in the hemolytic reaction mediated by C9 (22Boyle M.D.P. Borsos T. Mol. Immunol. 1980; 17: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These included binding of the final complement component (C9), which can occur on ice, a temperature-dependent event that was related to C9 insertion into the erythrocyte membrane followed by rearrangement or activation to yield a transmembrane pore that allowed lysis to occur in a temperature-independent colloid osmotic step (22Boyle M.D.P. Borsos T. Mol. Immunol. 1980; 17: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To determine whether SLS-mediated hemolysis followed a sequence of events similar to that of the complement-mediated hemolytic reaction, a parallel experimental strategy was employed. Initially the ability of SLS to bind to red cells at 17 °C, a temperature at which no hemolysis occurs (Fig. 5 A), was tested. A concentration of SLS that resulted in ∼50% hemolysis, if incubated with the same number of red cells for 1 h at 37 °C, was used. Parallel samples were incubated for 5, 10, or 15 min at 17 °C, the cells were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min and washed with VBS gel to remove any unbound SLS. The washed cell pellet was resuspended in VBS gel buffer, and duplicate samples were incubated at either 17 or 37 °C for 1 h. At the end of this second incubation period hemolysis was determined by pelleting intact erythrocytes and measuring released hemoglobin. The binding of SLS to the red cells was found to be complete within 15 min at 17 °C, and no erythrocytes were lysed unless subsequently incubated at 37 °C (data not shown). The kinetics of lysis of red blood cells to which SLS was bound for 15 min at 17 °C was determined over time at either 17 or 37 °C. The kinetics of hemolysis for SLS bound at 17 °C and subsequently incubated at 37 °C was similar to that observed when SLS was present at 37 °C throughout the reaction (compare Figs. 4 A and6). No lysis occurred if the cells were incubated at 17 °C throughout (Fig. 6). These results were consistent with some temperature-dependent rearrangement of the bound SLS molecule being required before hemolysis occurred. In an attempt to determine whether the hemolytic potential of bound SLS could be reversed by protease treatment, SLS was bound to sheep erythrocytes at 17 °C for 15 min. The cells were washed to remove unbound SLS, and aliquots were treated with different concentrations of a number of different proteases before washing and incubation at 37 °C to determine the extent of hemolysis. The hemolytic potential of bound SLS was most efficiently reversed by treatment with papain (data not shown). Having established conditions of papain treatment at 17 °C that could reverse the potential hemolysis of SLS bound to red cells, the next experiment was designed to determine whether, at some point prior to the cells lysing, an intermediate could be identified that was resistant to papain treatment, i.e. papain was no longer able to prevent SLS bound to red cells from mediating lysis. For these studies, SLS-bound red cells were prepared by incubating red cells with SLS for 15 min at 17 °C and washing. Aliquots of cells to which SLS was bound were incubated for varying periods at 23 °C before being subjected to a papain treatment at 17 °C. The effects of papain treatment were then evaluated by incubating the washed enzyme-treated cell pellet at 37 °C for 60 min. A time-dependent conversion of SLS-coated erythrocytes from a papain-sensitive state to a papain-resistant, nonlysed, intermediate was observed (Fig. 7, black bars). Incubation at 23 °C, in the absence of papain, did not affect the subsequent ability of SLS to lyse the erythrocytes (Fig. 7,hatched bars). These results are consistent with SLS becoming an integral membrane protein as a result of inserting into the erythrocyte membrane in a time- and temperature-dependent reaction. Based on previous studies of complement-mediated hemolysis (24DeLisi C. Boyle M.D.P. Borsos T. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2055-2062PubMed Google Scholar, 25DeLisi C. Boyle M.D.P. Borsos T. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2334-2338PubMed Google Scholar), it should be possible to distinguish between the insertion of SLS into the membrane and the osmotic lysis of the cells, provided SLS mediates its hemolytic potential in a similar way to complement by formation of a transmembrane pore. To test this prediction SLS was bound to red cells at 17 °C, washed, and then suspended in osmolar solutions of NaCl (Stoke’s radius, 0.14 nm) glucose (0.36 nm), sucrose (0.46 nm), or raffinose (0.56 nm). The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and the extent of hemolysins was determined. In the presence of isotonic solution of either glucose, sucrose, or raffinose hemolysis of SLS-coated erythrocytes was inhibited as compared with aliquots of cells incubated in an isotonic NaCl solution (Fig.8, black bars). This inhibition was attributable to the osmotic blocking by the sugar solutions because reincubation of any cell pellets in NaCl results in the expected level of hemolysis when incubated at 4 °C for 60 min (Fig. 8, hatched bars). The results of these studies indicate that SLS-mediated hemolysis involves disruption of the semi-permeable properties of a red cell by formation of a defined size pore in the membrane. Based on the properties of the blocking sugars tested, the predicted pore size is between 0.14 and 0.36 nm. The oxygen-stable hemolysin SLS of group A (S. pyogenes), C, and G streptococci has never been fully characterized. Despite the functional property of hemolysis being easy to quantify the predicted protein composition of SLS from different isolates has varied widely (4Koyama J. Egami F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1963; 53: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 5Lai C.Y. Wang M.-T. Defaria J.B. Akao T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 191: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6Koyama J. Egami F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1963; 54: 146-151PubMed Google Scholar). Recent genetic studies have identified a locus in S. pyogenes that has been convincingly associated with encoding this oxygen-stable hemolysin (7Betschel S. Borgia S. Barg N. Low D.E. Azavedo J. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Li Z. Sledjeski D. Kreikemeyer B. Podbielski A. Boyle M.D.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6019-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nizet V. Beall B. Bast D.J. Datta V. Kilburn L. Low D.E. Azavedo J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4245-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The predicted ORF encoding the hemolysin, pel/sagA, is present in group A, C, and G streptococci but not group B (10Eberhard T.H. Sledjeski D.D. Boyle M.D.P. 100th General Meeting American Society of Microbiology, Los Angeles, California, May, 2000. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with earlier studies that have indicated the oxygen-stable β hemolysin associated with group B isolates is functionally distinct from that of other β hemolytic streptococci (11Pritzlaff C.A. Chang J.C.W. Kuo S.P. Tamura G.S. Rubens C.E. Nizet V. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12Spellerberg B. Pohl B. Haase G. Martin S. Weber-Heynemann J. Lutticken R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3212-3219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using antibodies generated to synthetic peptides based on the predicted primary sequence of the pel/sagA gene ORF, we have demonstrated that an antibody specific to a C-terminal peptide of Pel totally inhibits SLS-mediated hemolysis by several different serotypes of S. pyogenes as well as a commercial preparation of SLS. This is the first report of a neutralizing antibody specific for SLS. Biochemically purified SLS is not immunogenic, and no anti-SLS antibodies are generated in the human host during infection (1Ginsburg I. Montie T.C. Kadis S. Ajl S.J. Microbial Toxins: Bacterial Protein Toxins. 3. Academic Press, New York1972: 100-171Google Scholar). This ability to generate a neutralizing antibody to a defined synthetic peptide could have potential implications in diagnostics and therapy of S. pyogenes. The antibody generated to an N-terminal peptide sequence of Pel failed to neutralize SLS activity. This region of the hemolysin is rich in cysteine residues (7 of 15 residues are cysteines), and thus the synthetic peptide may not have had the appropriate three-dimensional configuration present in the native SLS molecule to form neutralizing antibodies. The inhibitory effects of the C-terminal antibody, however, indicate that the major oxygen-stable hemolysins secreted by S. pyogenes are related to the pel/sagA gene product (Fig.2). Based on the efficiency of the SLS preparation to mediate hemolysis at dilutions below which any protein could be detected, we cannot conclude unequivocally that the peaks observed in the SELDI-TOF analysis I (Fig. 1 A) represent the functional form(s) of SLS. The finding that one SLS complex is necessary and significant to lyse an erythrocyte allows the functional assay to detect active SLS at concentrations in the subattomolar range. This coupled with the small size of the SLS peptide makes it difficult to unequivocally characterize the SLS peptide by conventional physiochemical methods. Analysis of the hemolytic activity of a partially purified SLS preparation derived from a S. pyogenes isolate indicated that the mechanism of hemolysis was similar to that mediated by complement. Both hemolytic systems are time- and temperature-dependent as well as conforming to the predictions of a one-hit mechanism (14Boyle M.D.P. Gee A.P. Boros T. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 77-82PubMed Google Scholar, 25DeLisi C. Boyle M.D.P. Borsos T. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2334-2338PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. one complex of SLS peptide(s) and carrier or one molecule of C9 is necessary and sufficient to lyse one red blood cell. The overall mechanism of hemolysis was also similar, involving a series of defined steps (Fig. 9). The SLS-bound intermediates were analogous to the intermediate generated by binding of C9 to EAC1–8 in the complement-dependent hemolytic reaction (22Boyle M.D.P. Borsos T. Mol. Immunol. 1980; 17: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the complement model (Fig. 9) it was possible to distinguish two forms of cell-associated C9: a bound form that could be removed by treatment with a protease and an inserted form that could not be removed by enzymatic treatment (23Boyle M.D.P. Langone J.J. Boros T. J. Immunol. 1978; 120: 1721-1725PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we have demonstrated equivalent intermediates in the SLS-mediated hemolytic reaction. Initially SLS bound at 17 °C could be removed or inactivated by treatment with papain; however, following a brief incubation at 23 °C, an intermediate state could be identified in which treatment of papain failed to reverse the hemolytic potential of the bound SLS molecule. This step is associated with a change in SLS from having the properties of an extrinsic protein, which can be removed by treatment with papain to a papain-resistant form having the properties of an intrinsic membrane protein. This reaction is temperature-dependent and occurs prior to the red cell undergoing irreversible hemolysis. Analysis of the effect of antibody and trypan blue indicated that they exerted their inhibitory effect prior to binding of SLS to the erythrocyte. Neither reagent had any effect on hemolysis once SLS was bound (data not shown). The SLS-mediated hemolysis also appears to result in pore formation. Addition of osmotic blockers of different Stokes' radii suggested formation of a pore whose size was between 0.14 and 0.36 nm. There was no evidence in these studies that these pores can aggregate or combine to create larger transmembrane channels. In earlier studies of complex-mediated hemolysis, differences in the pore size could be identified based on differences in the ratio of C8 to C9 (26Boyle M.D.P. Gee A.P. Borsos T. Immunol.

It is of interest that earlier electron microscopy studies of SLS-mediated hemolysis failed to identify complement-like pores in red cell membranes (32Dourmashksin R.R. Rosse W.F. Am. J. Med. 1966; 41: 699-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In similar studies of complement-mediated red cells lysis under conditions of limiting C9, we also failed to demonstrate the classical pore structures when examined by electron microscopy. 2M. D. P. Boyle and T. Borsos, unpublished results. These EM structures are only observed under conditions of excess complement that facilitate polymerization of C5b-9 complexes (33Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J.

Symp. 1985; 50: 221-233PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated 30-nm pore-like structures formed in erythrocyte membranes following lysis with the oxygen sensitive streptococcal hemolysin streptolysin, which has recently been shown to be part of a system mimicking type III secretion in Gram-positive bacteria (34Madden J.C. Ruiz N. Caparon M. Cell. 2001; 104: 143-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The studies presented in this paper confirm the importance of the pel/sagA gene in encoding the polypeptide backbone of SLS; the precise chemical nature of the effective molecule has not yet been elucidated. The importance of the core structure is apparent because pel/sagA expressed in Escherichia coli fails to produce an active hemolysin (data not shown). The ability of group A, C, and G streptococci to secrete SLS in a soluble functionally active form that can bind to and insert into cell membranes forming a transmembrane channel is intriguing. This complex binds to an erythrocyte membrane under aqueous conditions and then undergoes a temperature-dependent rearrangement to create a stable pore in a biomolecular lipid membrane. This represents a highly evolved mechanism for a single toxin molecule. In the case of the membrane attack complex of complement formation of a transmembrane pore involves five soluble plasma proteins that interact to produce a hydrophobic core that inserts and forms a pore in a red cell membrane (35DiScipio R.G. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 4239-4247PubMed Google Scholar, 36Esser A.F. Toxicology. 1994; 87: 229-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Bhakdi S. Bjerrum O.J. Bhakdi-Lehnen B. Tranum-Jensen J. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 2526-2532PubMed Google Scholar). This hydrophilic-hydrophobic transition is achieved by structural rearrangements that occur as the five terminal complement components interact with each other and form intermediate complexes that expose hydrophobic regions that align to form the transmembrane pore (34Madden J.C. Ruiz N. Caparon M. Cell. 2001; 104: 143-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 35DiScipio R.G. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 4239-4247PubMed Google Scholar, 36Esser A.F. Toxicology. 1994; 87: 229-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this case, SLS, a similar pore-forming complex can be generated from a single soluble molecular complex secreted by the bacteria that on binding to a cell membrane can insert and form a transmembrane pore. At this time it is not clear whether the polypeptide component of the SLS complex is involved with the hydrophilic activity of maintaining solubility of this complex or the pore forming potential or both. A detailed analysis of the precise composition and structure of SLS will help to elucidate why this streptococcal complex is such an effective bacterial toxin.

To further identify participants in the OSF signaling cascade, we used yeast two-hybrid screening withSaccharomyces cerevisiae, and we found that the 40-kDa spinal muscular atrophy disease-determining gene product, survival motor neuron (SMN), interacts with the OSF-Src homology 3 domain. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of SMN mRNA expression in cells of the OCL lineage demonstrates that expression of the exon 7 splice variant of SMN is restricted to mature OCLs, whereas the unspliced transcript was expressed in OCL precursors as well as mature OCLs. Treatment of murine bone marrow cultures with conditioned media (5% (v/v)) from 293 cells transiently expressing the SMN cDNA significantly increased OCL formation, compared with treatment with conditioned media from mock-transfected cells. Furthermore, OCL-stimulatory activity by OSF or SMN was abolished by antisense constructs to SMN or OSF, respectively. These data confirm the participation of SMN in the OSF-enhanced expression of an OCL stimulator.

Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 308-332PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that factors produced by OCLs themselves play an important role in regulating OCL formation and activity (2Reddy S.V. Roodman G.D. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Using an expression cloning approach with a human OCL cDNA library, we previously identified annexin II and OIP-1/hSca as autocrine/paracrine factors that regulate OCL formation and activity (3Takahashi S.

Roodman G.D. Reddy S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1360-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, using this approach, we also identified a novel 28-kDa intracellular peptide termed osteoclast-stimulating factor (OSF) that indirectly enhances OCL formation and bone resorption through a cellular signal transduction cascade, possibly through its interaction with c-Src or related family members (5Reddy S.V. Devlin R. Menaa C. Nishimura R. Choi S. Dallas M. Yoneda T. Roodman G.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). OSF is highly expressed in OCL and contains structural domains such as SH3 and ankyrin repeats, which are potentially involved in protein-protein interactions. OSF is ubiquitously expressed analogous to other regulators of OCL activity such as c-Src or transforming growth factor β. We have recently assigned the OSF gene (OSTF1) to human chromosome band 12q24.1 by fluorescent in situ hybridization (6Schaub R. Dupont B. Roodman G.D. Leach R.J. Reddy S.V. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 88: 87-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Local factors produced by stromal cells or osteoblastic cells in the bone microenvironment play an important role in OCL differentiation. Recent evidence supports a central role for tumor necrosis factor gene family members receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) ligand and RANK receptor in OCL differentiation (7Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I. Colombero A. Timms E. Tan H.L. Elliott R. Chiu L. Black T. Scully S. Capparelli C. Morony S. Shimamoto G. Bass M.B. Boyle W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Transcription factors such as PU.1 and Fos deficiency caused osteopetrosis in mice (8Tondravi M.M. McKercher S.R. Anderson K.

Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Recently, an OCL-derived zinc finger protein, OCZF, a possible transcriptional repressor, has been shown to be involved in osteoclastogenesis (10Kukita A. Kukita T. Ouchida M. Maeda H. Yatsuki H. Kohashi O. Blood. 1999; 94: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, intracellular signals in response to external stimuli play an important role in inducing OCL differentiation. Although, Src tyrosine kinase is ubiquitously expressed and has been implicated in a wide variety of signal transduction pathways, Src-deficient mice showed an osteopetrotic phenotype (11Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that distinct ligand preferences for c-Src/SH3 domains mediate protein-protein interactions through binding of short proline-rich regions in the ligand proteins (12Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). High affinity binding of OSF with c-Src in vitro suggested a potential role for OSF in the OCL bone resorption process through protein interaction with the cellular signal transduction machinery (5Reddy S.V. Devlin R. Menaa C. Nishimura R. Choi S. Dallas M. Yoneda T. Roodman G.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of ankyrin repeats in OSF further suggested potential interaction with other cellular proteins. Ankyrin repeats are present in proteins involved in cell cycle and tissue differentiation. These motifs have been shown to be confined to specific membrane domains and bind integral membrane proteins such as Na+- and K+-ATPase and the voltage-dependent Na+ channel in hematopoietic cells (13Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to identify OSF-interacting proteins in addition to c-Src to unravel the novel signaling cascade that results in the secretion of soluble stimulator(s) of OCL formation and activity. In the present study, we used yeast two-hybrid screening and identified the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) disease-determining gene product, SMN protein (40 kDa), and its interaction with the OSF-SH3 domain. We further characterized SMN expression in OCL and its participation in OSF-induced OCL formation. An OSF cDNA encoding the 57 amino acids that span the SH3 domain was PCR-amplified with the EcoRI and NcoI restriction enzyme sites flanking the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. A bait construct was then prepared by subcloning the OSF-SH3 domain in frame at the carboxyl terminus of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the pGBT8 vector (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). The resulting bait plasmid (OSF Hyb SH3#3) was subjected to yeast two-hybrid screening using a HeLa cell cDNA library generated by directional cloning into theEcoRI/XhoI sites located at the carboxyl terminus end of the GAL4 activation domain open reading frame of the pGAD-GH prey vector. Both the bait and prey plasmids were cotransformed by electroporation into the Y166 yeast strain containing a lacZ reporter gene whose expression was controlled by upstream binding sites of the GAL1 promoter (14Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4794) Google Scholar). The yeast transformants were grown on agar plates containing Trp, His, and Leu dropout nutritional selection media in the presence of 50 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and assayed for lacZ activity. The prey plasmid containing HeLa cell cDNA, which interacted with the OSF bait plasmid in the lacZ-positive yeast clones, was segregated by transforming it into the MH4 Escherichia coli strain and selected on Leu dropout culture plates. The OSF-SH3 domain-interacting prey plasmid was then isolated and subjected to DNA sequence analysis. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were coupled with purified GST orE. coli-derived GST-SMN fusion proteins. GST or GST-SMN fusion proteins (2 µg) were incubated with total cell lysates (500 µg of protein) of 293 cells that were transiently expressed with OSF cDNA at 4 °C for 2 h in binding buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The samples were spun down briefly, washed four times with the same buffer, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gel). Western blot analysis was then performed using rabbit antisera raised against recombinant OSF at a 1:5000 dilution as described previously (5Reddy S.V. Devlin R. Menaa C. Nishimura R. Choi S. Dallas M. Yoneda T. Roodman G.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The OSF cDNA was transiently expressed in 293 cells, and total cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 200 µm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin). The cell extract (500 µg of protein) was incubated with 1 µg of an anti-SMN antibody for 1 h, and the immune complex was separated using a protein G-agarose conjugate. A control immunoprecipitation using mouse IgG was run in parallel. The immune complex was washed four times with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EGTA and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gel). Western blot analysis was performed using OSF antisera as described previously (5Reddy S.V. Devlin R. Menaa C. Nishimura R. Choi S. Dallas M. Yoneda T. Roodman G.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 µg of total RNA isolated from highly purified OCLs and OCL precursor cells using RNAzol reagent (Biotecx, Houston, TX) (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62896) Google Scholar) was reverse transcribed with random hexamers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The resulting cDNAs were then amplified by PCR using 0.15 µm concentrations of forward (5′-CTCCCATATGTCCAGATTCTCTTG-3′) and reverse (5′-ACTGCCTCACCACCGTGCTGG-3′) SMN gene-specific primers in a final volume of 100 µl containing 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3). The PCR reaction was carried out by incubating the samples at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min and 60 °C for 1 min, with a final extension for 5 min at 60 °C. The amplified products were electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel with a 123-base pair DNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) as a size marker. The bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Human bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells were cultured in 0.8% methyl cellulose in the presence of recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (1 ng/ml) for a 1-week period to form early OCL precursors. These cultures were then overlaid with 10−8m1,25-(OH)2D3 and cultured for an additional week to induce the formation of more differentiated or late OCL precursors. Late OCL precursors were purified from these cultures using the 23c6 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the OCL vitronectin receptor (16Horton M.A. Lewis D. McNulty K. Pringle J.A.S. Chambers T.J. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5663-5669PubMed Google Scholar). Human bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (106 cells/ml) were cultured in a 96-well plate for 3 weeks in the presence of 10−8m 1,25-(OH)2D3 to form OCL-like cells. At the end of the culture period, OCL-like cells formed in these long-term marrow cultures were isolated using the 23c6 anti-vitronectin antibody as described previously (17Kurihara N. Gluck S. Roodman G.D. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3215-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Bone marrow from C57 black mouse tibiae that had been aseptically removed was obtained by flushing the tibiae with 1 ml of α-minimum Eagle's medium using a tuberculin syringe fitted with a 27.5-gauge needle. The bone marrow-derived cells were washed twice, resuspended in α-minimum Eagle's medium-10% fetal calf serum, and depleted of plastic-adherent cells by incubating the marrow cell suspension in sterile 10-cm tissue culture dishes for 2 h. The nonadherent marrow cells were collected and cultured in quadruplicate for 8 days in 48-well plates at a density of 5 × 105cells/well in α-minimum Eagle's medium-10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 10−9m1,25-(OH)2D3 as described by Takahashi et al. (18Takahashi N. Yamana H. Yoshiki S. Roodman G.D. Mundy G.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1987; 122: 1373-1382Crossref Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The cultures were fixed with 4.5 mm citric acid, 2.25 mm sodium citrate, 3 mm sodium chloride, 3% formaldehyde, and acetone and washed twice in distilled water. The cultures were then stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity using an acid phosphatase staining kit (Sigma). The tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive MNCs containing three or more nuclei were scored with an inverted microscope. Human bone marrow-derived OCL-like multinucleated cells were cultured as described above. At the end of culture period, the cells were fixed in Bouin's solution for 12 h. Cells were permeabilized by adding cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. After preincubation in 1% bovine serum albumin, monoclonal antibody 2B1, which recognizes human SMN (19Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), was added (diluted 1:200 in phosphate-buffered saline and 1% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. The cells were washed and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:200) for 1 h. Peroxidase activity was detected by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine in the presence of 0.1% hydrogen peroxide as described previously (17Kurihara N. Gluck S. Roodman G.D. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 3215-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that interact with the OSF-SH3 domain, we used the yeast two-hybrid screening of a HeLa cell cDNA library in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The basic scheme of yeast two-hybrid assay using a bait plasmid containing the OSF-SH3 domain and prey plasmid containing SMN cDNA isolated from a HeLa cell cDNA library and the GAL1 promoter region driving lacZ reporter gene expression in Y166 yeast strain is schematically represented in Fig. 1A. Two-hybrid screening in the Y166 yeast strain resulted in the identification of a putative candidate prey plasmid from a HeLa cell cDNA library that interacts with the OSF-SH3 bait, resulting in expression of lacZ activity (Fig. 1B). The prey plasmid isolated from the lacZ-positive yeast clone upon sequence analysis further identified the cDNA (1 kb) encoding the SMA disease-determining gene product, SMN protein, which contains 294 amino acids with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa (20Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B. Cruaud C. Millasseau P. Zeviani M. Paslier D.L. Frezal J. Cohen D. Weissenbach J. Munnich A. Melki J. Cell. 1995; 80: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2889) Google Scholar). The interaction between OSF and SMN was further confirmed by in vitrobinding of OSF with E. coli-derived GST-SMN fusion protein. As evident from Fig. 2A, OSF demonstrated binding to the GST-SMN fusion protein. However, GST alone did not bind OSF in vitro. We then tested the in vitro affinity binding of OSF to GST-SMN exon deletion mutant proteins to identify the functional domains of SMN involved in OSF interaction. OSF demonstrated affinity binding with GST-SMN mutant proteins containing exons 6 and 7 and exon 6 alone. In contrast, GST-SMN mutant protein containing the exon 1–4 region did not demonstrate affinity binding with the OSF in vitro. We also confirmed the OSF-SMN interaction by coimmunoprecipitation using an anti-SMN antibody. OSF was immunoprecipitated from 293 cell lysates with an anti-SMN antibody. In contrast, a control IgG did not demonstrate coimmunoprecipitation of OSF (Fig. 2B). We previously reported OSF affinity binding to c-Src SH3-SH2 domain (5Reddy S.V. Devlin R. Menaa C. Nishimura R. Choi S. Dallas M. Yoneda T. Roodman G.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, anti-SMN antibody did not demonstrate coimmunoprecipitation of c-Src from 293 cell lysates (data not shown). These data further confirm the specificity of SMN interaction with OSF. Expression of SMN protein in OCL-like cells formed in long-term human bone marrow cultures was examined by immunocytochemistry. Immunostaining using the 2B1 mouse anti-human SMN monoclonal antibody confirmed the expression of SMN protein in OCL-like cells and mononuclear cells (Fig.3). The control IgG did not show a positive reaction in these cells, confirming the specificity of SMN expression in OCL. It has been reported that the SMN mRNA demonstrates exon 7 splicing and that the relative levels of native and splice variant forms correlated with the severity of the SMA disease. Therefore, we used reverse transcription-PCR analysis to examine SMN mRNA expression in cells of the OCL lineage using sense and antisense primers flanking exons 6 and 8, respectively (20Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B. Cruaud C. Millasseau P. Zeviani M. Paslier D.L. Frezal J. Cohen D. Weissenbach J. Munnich A. Melki J. Cell. 1995; 80: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2889) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, total RNA isolated from highly purified early OCL precursors (CFU-GM), more differentiated OCL precursors, and mature OCLs demonstrated expression of the SMN mRNA containing exons 6, 7, and 8. However, only mature OCLs expressed the exon 7 splice variant of SMN mRNA. The native SMN mRNA appeared to be more abundant compared with the exon 7 splice variant. This suggests that the exon 7 splice variant of SMN may have a functional role in mature OCLs.Figure 4Reverse transcription-PCR analysis ofSMNmRNA expression in cells of the osteoclast lineage. Total RNA was isolated from normal human bone marrow-derived early OCL precursors (EP), late OCL precursors (LP), and mature OCL (OCL). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed using SMN gene-specific primers flanking exons 6 and 8 as described. The schematic representation of the 0.42-kb PCR band obtained corresponds to an unspliced SMN gene transcript containing exons 6, 7, and 8 as shown in the top panel. A 0.36-kilobase band obtained in the bottom panel corresponds to the exon 7 splice variant. A 123-base pair DNA size marker (M) was used to determine the molecular size of the PCR products.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether SMN could participate in the production of an OCL stimulator, 293 cells were transiently expressed with SMN cDNA. Conditioned media collected from these cells were tested at 0–10% concentrations for their effects on OCL formation in mouse bone marrow cultures. Treatment of mouse marrow cultures with SMN-conditioned media at a 5% concentration significantly increased tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive MNC formation in the absence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (Fig.5A). However, in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D3(10−9m), SMN-conditioned media at 0.02% significantly stimulated OCL formation (Fig. 5B). These data are analogous to our previous results with OSF-conditioned media from 293 cells, which enhanced OCL formation in the presence and absence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (5Reddy S.V. Devlin R. Menaa C. Nishimura R. Choi S. Dallas M. Yoneda T. Roodman G.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We further examined the capacity of OSF or SMN antisense expression constructs to block release of OCL-stimulatory factor(s) in conditioned media from 293 cells. OCL-stimulatory activity of SMN-conditioned media was significantly blocked upon cotransfection with OSF antisense construct. Similarly, OSF activity was abolished when OSF was coexpressed with SMN antisense constructs in 293 cells (Fig. 6). In contrast, conditioned media obtained from 293 cells transiently expressed with the OSF or SMN antisense construct alone or in mock-transfected control cell cultures did not significantly affect osteoclast formation. These data confirm the participation of SMN in the OSF-enhanced expression of an OCL stimulator. Therefore, our results suggest that the interactions between SMN and OSF may play an important role in a novel signaling cascade that induces an as yet unidentified stimulator(s) of OCL formation and activity.Figure 6Neutralization of osteoclast-stimulatory activity byOSFandSMNantisense expression constructs. 293 cells were transiently transfected with OSF or SMN expression constructs and coexpressed with SMN antisense (SMN-AS) and OSF antisense (OSF-AS) plasmid constructs, respectively. The conditioned media were collected after 48 h and assayed for OCL-stimulatory activity in mouse bone marrow cultures by scoring tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive MNCs formed in these cultures. ∗,p < 0.01 compared with OSF or SMN.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recently, using an expression cloning approach, we have identified and cloned OSF, a novel intracellular protein produced by OCL that indirectly enhances OCL formation and bone resorption (5Reddy S.V.

It is a 28-kDa peptide that contains a c-Src homology 3 domain and ankyrin repeats, suggesting that it is potentially involved in intracellular signaling. Furthermore, recombinant OSF demonstrated high affinity binding to c-Src, an important regulator of OCL activity (21Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). This interaction of OSF with c-Src results in secretion of soluble stimulator(s) of OCL formation, which suggests a possible role for OSF in the bone resorption process through protein interactions with cellular signal transduction machinery. The present study begins to identify other signaling molecules that might interact with OSF. Because OSF expression is ubiquitous, and a yeast two-hybrid OCL cDNA library is not available at present, we have performed yeast two-hybrid screening using a HeLa cell cDNA library to identify proteins that interact with OSF. We thus identified the SMA disease-determining gene product SMN as a protein that binds to the OSF-SH3 domain. In vitro affinity binding studies further mapped OSF binding to the SMN exon 6 region. Liu et al. (22Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) have previously identified that the P2 peptide region of the SMN protein carboxyl terminus (amino acids 240–267) was involved in the interaction with the Sm proteins (small nuclear ribonuclear protein core protein). Coimmunoprecipitation of OSF with an anti-SMN antibody further confirmed the specificity of OSF-SMN interaction. We had previously identified OSF interaction with the c-Src SH3-SH2 domain (5Reddy S.V. Devlin R. Menaa C. Nishimura R. Choi S. Dallas M. Yoneda T. Roodman G.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, c-Src does not immunoprecipitate with an anti-SMN antibody (data not shown), further suggesting that OSF may play a central role in the cellular signal transduction cascade leading to the release of soluble factor(s) that stimulates osteoclast formation and activity. SMA disease is the second most common fatal autosomal recessive disorder (23Pearn J. J. Med. Genet. 1978; 15: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Although SMA disease is characterized primarily by the degeneration of lower motor neurons, it also involves congenital bone fractures (24Kelly T.E. Amoroso K. Ferre M. Blanco J. Allinson P. Prior T.W. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 87: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical staining confirmed the expression of SMN in OCL. Therefore, the OSF interaction with SMN may have a potential role in OCL formation and bone resorption. Recently, SMN has been shown to interact with Bcl-2, and coexpression of SMN with Bcl-2 prevented Bax-induced or Fas-mediated apoptosis, although SMN itself had only weak antiapoptotic activity (25Iwahashi H. Eguchi Y. Yasuhara N. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1997; 390: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, SMN has been shown to interact with the SIP-1 protein complex (26Lefebvre S. Burlet P. Liu Q. Bertrandy S. Clermont O. Munich A. Dreyfuss G. Melki J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanisms for SMN-SIP-1 nuclear translocation are unclear, it is evident that the SMN-SIP-1 complex is directly involved in the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. It is also unclear whether SMN could directly participate in gene transcription upon translocation to nucleus. The SMN gene is located on chromosome 5q13, and the mRNA analysis demonstrated splicing of exon 7, which contains 16 amino acids (20Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B. Cruaud C. Millasseau P. Zeviani M. Paslier D.L. Frezal J. Cohen D. Weissenbach J. Munnich A. Melki J. Cell. 1995; 80: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2889) Google Scholar). However, a role for the exon 7 splice variant of SMN is not yet known. Although SMN is ubiquously expressed, differential expression of the exon 7 splice variant of SMN in mature OCLs may have a potential role in OCL activity. It has been reported that the SMN oligomerization defect that results from increased expression of the SMN exon 7 splice variant correlates with the severity of SMA disease (25Iwahashi H. Eguchi Y. Yasuhara N. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1997; 390: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Furthermore, exon 7 C to T transition at codon 280, a translationally silent variance, is sufficient to dictate exon 7 alternative splicing (27Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Mouse SMN is 82% identical to the human protein. The mouse genome contains a single copy of SMN, in contrast to human genome, which contains two copies. SMN does not appear to be alternatively spliced in mouse tissues (28Bergin A. Kim G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Lee M.K. Rabin B.A. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 204: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice with homozygous SMN disruption display massive cell death during early embryonic development, indicating that the SMN is necessary for cellular survival and function (29Schrank B. Gotz R. Gunnersen J.M. Ure J.M. Toyka K.V. Smith A.G. Sendtner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9920-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). More recently Monani et al. (30Monani U.R. Sendtner M. Coovert D.D. Parsons D.W. Andreassi C. Le T.T. Jablonka S. Schrank B. Rossol W. Prior T.W. Morris G.E. Burghes A.H.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) have shown that SMN2 gene expression in SMN(−/−) mice rescued embryonic lethality and that the rescued mice had spinal muscular atrophy. Our data further suggest SMN participation in OSF-induced OCL formation. SMN-conditioned media stimulate OCL formation analogous to OSF, and OCL-stimulatory activity can be blocked by antisense constructs to OSF or SMN, respectively. These data confirm the participation of SMN in the expression of an OCL stimulator through an interaction with the OSF. At present, the identity of downstream targets and soluble factor(s) released in response to OSF-SMN signaling is unknown. However, SMN may directly influence the basic transcription machinery through interaction with specific transcription factors that would induce preferential osteotropic factor(s) gene expression. Recently, it has been shown that the profilins bind to and colocalize with SMN in nuclear gems and that this interaction may be involved in the neuron-specific effects associated with SMA disease (31Giesemann T. Rathke-Hartlieb S. Rothkegel M. Bartsch J.W. Buchmeier S. Jockusch B.M. Jockusch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37908-37914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Other proteins reported to interact with SMN include transcription factor E2 (nuclear transcription activator of papilloma virus) and for upstream (FUSE) binding protein (32Strasswimmer J. Lorson C.L. Breiding D.E. Chen J.J. Le T. Burghes A.H.M. Androphy E.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 33Williams B.Y. Hamilton S.L. Sarkar H.K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, there are no published data showing that these protein interactions and functions are affected by the low SMN levels that exist in SMA patients or in the SMA mouse. It is possible that the deletions or point mutations that occur in many SMA patients and encompass exons 6 and 7 of the SMN protein may influence the OSF-SMN signaling mechanism. In a previous study, neutralizing antibodies to known osteotropic factors such as interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor α did not block OSF-induced osteoclast-stimulatory activity (5Reddy S.V. Devlin R. Menaa C. Nishimura R. Choi S. Dallas M. Yoneda T. Roodman G.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other osteotropic factors such as parathyroid hormone, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and RANK ligand may be responsive to OSF-SMN cellular signaling. Although our data indicate expression of SMN2 in osteoclasts, the interaction of SMN2 with OSF and its functional role in associated signaling are unknown at present. Therefore, SMN2-rescued SMN(−/−) mice would be a potential model to study the role of OSF and SMN in osteoclast develoment and bone resorption. Taken together, our data suggest that OSF interaction with SMN may play an important role in a novel signaling cascade that induces stimulator(s) of OCL formation. Therefore, OSF-SMN interaction may provide more insights into cellular signaling mechanisms that lead to congenital bone fractures associated with type I SMA disease. We thank Dr. G. David Roodman for helpful discussion and Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss for the generous gift of 2B1 monoclonal antibody against SMN protein. We thank Drs. Christian L. Lorson and Elliot J.

FT, Fourier transform free induction decay Interactions of proteins with other molecules can ultimately be ascribed to their surface features. Direct studies of protein surface accessibility are emerging as a new dimension of structural studies of proteins, particularly because repeated observations in either solution (1Liepinsh E. Otting G. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Dalvit C. Floersheim P. Zurini M. Widmer A. J. Biomol.

Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) have pointed out that proteins have regions where small and uncharged organic molecules, even those different from their physiological ligands, preferentially approach the molecular surface and also account for allosteric disruption of substrate binding (5Krantz A. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 198-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 6Savvides S.N. Karplus P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8101-8107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have shown that these “hot spots” of the protein surface can be easily mapped by a surface survey based on paramagnetic perturbation of conventional NMR spectra (7Scarselli M. Bernini A. Segoni C.

The surface properties are dictated by the relative position and specific features of exposed residues, but even detailed knowledge of the protein architecture may not be sufficient for a thorough description of surface properties because of the intrinsic disorder of these residue side chains. The complex properties of the protein surface are modulated by a variety of factors (e.g.electrostatics, hydrophobicity, and hydrogen bond ability) but share a common unifying feature: hydration. The blanket of water covering the protein surface is the actual interface between the solution environment and the underlying modulations. The possibility of exploiting the blanket resides mainly on two of its features, namely, the variable thickness of the water layers and the fact that residence times of water molecules vary from point to point (9Brunne R.M. Liepinsh E. Otting G. Wüthrich K. van Gunsteren W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1040-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Since the pioneering studies on protein hydration by Wüthrich’s and co-workers (10Otting G. Wüthrich K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 1871-1875Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 11Otting G. Liepinsh E. Wüthrich K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4363-4364Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it has been well established that NMR is a reliable technique with which to detect water molecules bound to proteins (12Otting G. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1997; 31: 259-285Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The early approaches were burdened by delicate hardware requirements, but now, thanks to developments in gradient-controlled sequences (12Otting G. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1997; 31: 259-285Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 13Dalvit C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 112: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Dalvit C. J. Biomol.

Boelens R. J. Magn. Reson. 1999; : 214-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects between water and protein molecules can be routinely measured and correlated to overall protein hydration. It has recently been proposed that the ability of surface mapping to reveal hot spots on the protein surface relies on the hindrance of bound water molecules to the approach of suitable paramagnetic probes to the protein (7Scarselli M. Bernini A. Segoni C. Molinari H. Esposito G. Lesk A.M. Laschi F. Temussi P. Niccolai N. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 15: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A combined use of paramagnetic perturbation and water-protein Overhauser spectroscopy based on 1D1 and 2D ePHOGSY (13Dalvit C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 112: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Dalvit C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 437-444Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar) can prove this link and may thus yield a faithful description of the static and dynamic properties of the water blanket. The attenuation of a specific set of hydrogen resonances in the NMR spectrum in the presence of a soluble paramagnetic probe reflects the accessibility of the corresponding locations on the protein surface (17Molinari H. Esposito G. Pegna M. Ragona L. Niccolai N. Zetta L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 382-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ePHOGSY experiments trace out different types of water-protein interactions by means of an initial intermolecular magnetization transfer step due to chemical exchange or dipolar interactions or both processes. Provided some prior knowledge of the protein structure (which is necessary anyway for result interpretation) is available, coupling of the two techniques should enable one to characterize the solvent modulation of the protein surface accessibility. Experimental assessment of different “modes” of water molecules on the protein surface can explain subtle phenomena that are difficult to reveal even by sophisticated molecular dynamic simulations because of the still approximate nature of available force fields. BPTI and tendamistat, two paradigmatic proteins that are well characterized both structurally (18Wlodawer A. Nachman J. Gilliland G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Berndt K.D. Guntert P. Orbons L.P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 695-706Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and with respect to interactions with the paramagnetic probe 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPOL), represent an ideal benchmark to test this novel surface survey approach. Tendamistat (a gift from Hoechst AG) and BPTI (obtained from Fluka) were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, whereas TEMPOL (obtained from Sigma) was used without any further manipulation. Tendamistat and BPTI samples were prepared by dissolving the proteins in H2O/2H2O (90:10, v/v) to make 2 and 6 mm solutions, respectively, adjusted to pH 3.15 and 3.5. The paramagnetic NMR samples contained an optimal TEMPOL concentration, which was achieved at a nitroxide/protein ratio of 10:1. This condition was reached by adding a few microliters of a 2 m TEMPOL solution directly to the NMR tube. NMR measurements were obtained at 309 and 323 K, respectively, for BPTI and tendamistat with a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer to reproduce the experimental conditions of the original structural studies (19Berndt K.D. Guntert P. Orbons L.P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Billeter M. Schaumann T. Braun W. Wüthrich K. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 695-706Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Data processing was performed with the Bruker software, and the spectral analysis was performed with NMRView (24Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). The 1H chemical shifts were referenced on trimethylsilylpropionic 2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt at 0 ppm. Resonance assignments for both proteins, which were available from the original structural work (19Berndt K.D. Guntert P. Orbons L.P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Billeter M. Schaumann T. Braun W. Wüthrich K. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 695-706Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), were checked anew under our experimental conditions using the scheme of sequential assignment described by Wüthrich (25Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. J. Wiley and Sons, New York1986: 130-161Google Scholar). According to this scheme, a conventional set of 2D spectra was recorded: correlated spectroscopy (26Aue W.P. Bartholdi E. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1976; 64: 2229-2246Crossref Scopus (3076) Google Scholar), TOCSY (27Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar), and nuclear Overhauser enhancement and exchange spectroscopy (28Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4809) Google Scholar). Water resonance was attenuated using a DANTE presaturation train superimposed on the specific sequence. Additional experimental parameters were the same as those described previously (7Scarselli M. Bernini A. Segoni C. Molinari H. Esposito G. Lesk A.M. Laschi F. Temussi P. Niccolai N. J. Biomol.

J. 1997; 73: 382-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A total of 470 increments were collected in t1, with 1908 data points and 64 scans/FID in t2, over a spectral width of 6 kHz in both dimensions. Before 2D FT, the experimental array was zero-filled to a final matrix of 2048 × 1024 data points. 1D ePHOGSY was performed with NOE and with ROE to discriminate between Overhauser and exchange effects, and 2D ePHOGSY-NOE-TOCSY (13Dalvit C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 112: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,14Dalvit C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 437-444Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar) was performed for a quantitative analysis of the effects. In all 1D ePHOGSY experiments, spectra were acquired with 16,384 data points and 4096 scans, whereas the 2D ePHOGSY-NOE-TOCSY spectra were obtained with 256 increments and 320 scans over 2048 t2 data points. After zero-filling, the final matrix was 4096 × 512 data points. In all ePHOGSY experiments, the mixing time to build up the intermolecular Overhauser effects was 200 ms, and the H2O-selective 180° Gaussian pulse between the first two pulsed field gradients had a duration of 50 ms and 60 db attenuation (13Dalvit C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 112: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Dalvit C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 437-444Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Water suppression was achieved through an excitation sculpting (29Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; A 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1511) Google Scholar) module appended to the sequences (13Dalvit C. J. Magn. Reson.

The experimental conditions of TOCSY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement and exchange spectroscopy, and 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra have been described elsewhere (7Scarselli M. Bernini A. Segoni C. Molinari H. Esposito G. Lesk A.M. Laschi F. Temussi P. Niccolai N. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 15: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Molinari H. Esposito G. Pegna M. Ragona L. Niccolai N. Zetta L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 382-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The decrease of peak intensities caused by the added TEMPOL was evaluated from a comparison of ePHOGSY-TOCSY with NOE spectra obtained in the presence and absence of the paramagnetic probe and performed and processed with the same parameters. As reported previously (17Molinari H. Esposito G. Pegna M. Ragona L. Niccolai N. Zetta L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 382-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), paramagnetic effects were measured by comparing autoscaled cross-peak attenuation figures (Ai, paramagnetic attenuation) defined as: Ai=2−(Vip/Vid)Eq. 1 i.e. the individual deviations from the average of the cross-peak autoscaled volumes, Vip,d, the latter of which is defined as:Vip,d=Vip,d/(1/n)(ΣiVip,d)Eq. 2 where n is the number of measured cross-peak volumes, and Vid and Vip are the protein individual cross-peak volumes measured in the absence and presence of the spin probe, respectively. The individual Ai values are plotted versusprotein sequence position, and the values above or below the average attenuation level (unitary by construction because (Σi Vip,d/n) = 1) correspond to high or low spin probe accessibility levels, respectively (17Molinari H. Esposito G. Pegna M. Ragona L. Niccolai N. Zetta L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 382-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). With this representation, it is easy to compare experiments performed under different conditions (temperature, protein and paramagnetic probe concentration, and solvents) because any specific effect is included in the mean value and the observed attenuations. A reference BPTI model was built by fitting all the backbone atoms of the solution and crystal structures found in the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 1PIT and 1BPI, respectively). The best fit (root mean square deviation = 0.728 Å) was achieved by comparing the fifteenth structure of 1PIT with 1BPI. In the hydrated solution structure, the coordinates of the four buried water molecules W111, W112, W113, and W122, according to the nomenclature of the crystallographic Protein Data Bank file 6PTI, were incorporated together with W105, W110, W138, and W158, conserved in all the available BPTI x-ray data. The reference tendamistat model was built by fitting all the backbone atoms of the solution and crystal structures of the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 4AIT and 1HOE, respectively) with a root mean square deviation = 2.22 Å. Then, the coordinates of the water molecules W84 and W85, according to the numbering of the crystal structure, were added to the solution structure. These waters, which are indeed partially buried and well conserved in the available crystal structures1HOE and 1BVN, should be considered structural ones. Both models were refined with 500 steps of energy minimization by the steepest descent method. The resulting structures were placed in a truncated octahedral box of equilibrated water. Ten steps of energy minimization with the steepest descent method followed by another 490 steps with the conjugate gradient method were carried out. Afterward, the equilibration of the BPTI/water and tendamistat/water systems was done in three stages by a molecular dynamic approach at increasing temperatures. In all runs, the temperatures of the protein and solvent were separately coupled to an isothermic bath. The pressure was kept constant by coupling to an isobaric bath at 1 bar. Bonds were always kept rigid using the SHAKE method with a relative tolerance of 10−4 Å. The length of the molecular dynamic elementary time step was 0.002 ps in all runs. During the first 2 ps trajectory at 100 K, the constants for coupling to the temperature and the pressure bath were 0.05 ps. For the subsequent 2 ps, the temperature was increased to 200 K. Finally, a run of 6 ps at 277 K was performed with temperature and pressure equilibration constants increased to 0.1 and 0.5 ps, respectively. All displayed structures derived from the above-mentioned protocols were generated with the program MOLMOL (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6454) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, the relative signal intensities measured in 2D ePHOGSY-NOE-TOCSY spectra (13Dalvit C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 112: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Dalvit C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 437-444Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar) of BPTI and tendamistat are reported with bar heights referring to the sum of the intensities of the cross-peaks measured in the ω2dimension. Sizeable water-protein Overhauser effects arising from intermolecular contacts shorter than 4–5 Å report on direct interactions between the solute and water molecules in its first hydration shell (12Otting G. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1997; 31: 259-285Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (206) Google Scholar); hence, the number of the observed water-protein NOEs should be, at first approximation, proportional to the protein accessible surface. This is not the case for the two proteins here investigated. The models built by using Protein Data Bank 4AIT and 1PIT entries, corresponding respectively to hydrated solution structure of tendamistat and BPTI, indicate that tendamistat has a water accessible surface of 4699.2 Å2, i.e. 11% larger than that of BPTI. Furthermore, in agreement with the different number of amino acid residues of the two proteins, BPTI exhibits 328 resolved proton signals, as compared with the 391 signals of tendamistat. In principle, both of these features should lead to a larger number of ePHOGSY signals for the latter protein. On the contrary, 121 and 86 protons of BPTI and tendamistat (37% and 22%, respectively, of the corresponding resolved NMR protons) yield ePHOGSY signals. This observation might reflect, in part, the difference in temperature of the data collection in the two structure determinations. However, the complex nature of the water blanket covering the two surfaces plays a mayor role (vide infra). ePHOGSY spectra report on protein hydrogen connectivities to water via all sorts of magnetization transfer effects, including the direct chemical exchange with bulk water that involves side chain or backbone labile protons. By comparing the peak sign of 1D ePHOGSY-NOE and ePHOGSY-ROE, direct information on the contributions from different magnetization-transfer time scales can be retrieved (13Dalvit C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 112: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Dalvit C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 437-444Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the intensities of the peaks arising from protons undergoing chemical exchange are positive in the 1D ePHOGSY-ROE (Fig. 2), i.e. opposite to any Overhauser effects in the rotating frame. Instead, in 1D ePHOGSY-NOE, the intensity of the water-protein Overhauser effects, which depends on the length and reorientation rate of the specific intermolecular internuclear vector, most commonly has the same sign as the chemical exchange effects as a consequence of the low frequency motional regime of macromolecules (negative Overhauser effect). It should be noted that both these mechanisms could contribute at the same time to the observed intensity of an individual ePHOGSY signal. From inspection of the histogram heights of Fig. 1, it is apparent that the exchange signals found in the 1D ePHOGSY-ROE are among the peaks with the highest intensity. Indeed, several protons of both proteins appear to be involved in chemical exchange processes. This is the case for tendamistat amide protons within the active site, i.e. S17, R19, and Y20, and for several other hydrogens highlighted in the same figure. However, according to previous observations (12Otting G. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1997; 31: 259-285Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (206) Google Scholar), all ePHOGSY peaks of serines, threonines, and tyrosines could be partly due to relayed transfers via the exchanging OH groups of these residues. This could partially explain the very high intensity of ePHOGSY signals of Y10 Hδ and Hε of BPTI and, in general, the enhancement observed in both proteins for any of the three OH-bearing residues. Because of the small size of the proteins, the high temperature, and the short mixing time used in the experiment, we can safely confine the chemical exchange contribution to only the protons in direct contact with the exchangeable protons. Almost all the detectable water-protein NOEs are negative (corresponding to positive peaks in Fig. 2), but a few positive Overhauser effects can be observed, both in the 1D ePHOGSY and 2D ePHOGSY-TOCSY spectra with NOE of BPTI and tendamistat. In the case of BPTI, positive effects are observed for L6 Hγ, A16 Hα, I19 Hβ, K26 Hε, and L29 Hβ3, all nuclei belonging to aliphatic moieties located on the surface of the protein. This feature may suggest that local high flexibility is responsible for this NOE sign inversion. Water molecules bound to surface hydrogens with residence times consistent with the build up of sizeable NOEs and involved in intermolecular dipolar interactions with mutual reorientation faster than 3 × 10−10 s (the sign inversion limit at the operative Larmor frequency) should indeed give positive Overhauser effects. A similar pattern is found for tendamistat because positive NOE effects (negative ePHOGSY peaks) are detected for the surface-exposed aliphatic side chain protons T2 Hγ, T3 Hγ, V4 Hγ, and L44 Hδ, as shown in Fig. 2 b. However, some care must be exerted before ascribing such results exclusively to the local flexibility of the macromolecules. Although positive NOEs between water and a structured macromolecule can always be considered as true dipolar effects, the same outcome would also be expected if the local mobility were due to bound but locally reorienting water molecules or to rapidly diffusing ones (12Otting G. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1997; 31: 259-285Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Additional independent measurements, such as NMR relaxation or diffusion-filtered determinations, are necessary to safely attribute the local mobility to the macromolecule rather than water or some combination of individual motions. Once the characteristics of all the peaks found in ePHOGSY-ROE and ePHOGSY-NOE spectra are analyzed in detail, and Overhauser effects and exchange processes are properly recognized, possibly by extending the experimental data set with diffusion-filtered determinations (13Dalvit C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1996; 112: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Dalvit C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 437-444Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar), it is possible, in principle, to interpret the NOE intensities in terms of internuclear distances and/or molecular dynamics, but such a calculation is far from trivial. Apart from possible difficulties with overlap of NOEs and relayed exchange contributions, even for genuine negative NOEs, no a priori assumption on correlation times or interproton distance calibrations can be easily made, as is customarily done with intramolecular Overhauser effects. On the other hand, when trying to map the features of the overall accessibility to a protein surface, we are more interested in relative mobility than in absolute mobility. Thus, in this report, no absolute analysis of the ePHOGSY peak intensities has been performed, and only the corresponding TEMPOL-induced paramagnetic perturbations are discussed. Additions of TEMPOL to the water solutions of BPTI and tendamistat cause, to different extents, attenuations of the 2D ePHOGSY-NOE-TOCSY peaks, in total analogy with the effects induced by the same spin label in other more conventional 2D spectra (17Molinari H. Esposito G. Pegna M. Ragona L. Niccolai N. Zetta L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 382-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Attenuations of 2D ePHOGSY-NOE-TOCSY peaks filter out the set of protein hydrogens whose accessibility is mediated by neighboring water molecules, whereas the corresponding attenuations in conventional 2D spectra (7Scarselli M. Bernini A. Segoni C. Molinari H. Esposito G. Lesk A.M. Laschi F. Temussi P. Niccolai N. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 15: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) yield the global accessibility. A comparison between the two ensembles allows the definition of fine aspects of accessibility. TEMPOL-edited ePHOGSY intensities, in fact, enable one to classify the protein-connected water molecules as: 1) bound (dynamically bound) to exposed and flexible (rigid) protein locations, 2) bound to exposed and rigid protein locations, 3) buried, or 4) ordered in a network that prevents close approach of small uncharged ligands. However, recognition of chemical exchange interactions that do not concern the entire water molecule but only its protons still rests on the comparison of ePHOGSY-ROE and ePHOGSY-NOE peak signs. Fig. 3 shows the comparison of 2D ePHOGSY-NOE-TOCSY peak intensities measured in the presence and absence of the paramagnetic probe. Autoscaled peak volumes of all detected signals are compared, as suggested previously (17Molinari H. Esposito G. Pegna M. Ragona L. Niccolai N. Zetta L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 382-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) for comparisons involving different data sets. The signal intensities of both proteins are modulated by specific attenuations along the sequence, but it is apparent that, overall, BPTI ePHOGSY signals are much less attenuated by TEMPOL than those of tendamistat. This finding is fully consistent with the presence of the four water molecules buried in the BPTI interior (18Wlodawer A. Nachman J. Gilliland G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Berndt K.D. Guntert P. Orbons L.P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These water molecules can yield an efficient intermolecular magnetization transfer to the inner proton environment of the protein that cannot be perturbed by the external paramagnetic probe. This situation is well illustrated by Fig. 4 a, which shows a BPTI three-dimensional model in which the internal waters (highlighted) are surrounded by all the hydrogens within a 5 Å shell from the oxygen atom of each of the buried waters. It is clear that resonances of protons “illuminated” by buried water magnetization cannot be quenched by TEMPOL. Most of the BPTI ePHOGSY signals exhibiting very low TEMPOL-induced attenuations are located in the inner part of the protein. In fact, 19 of 35 ePHOGSY signals that exhibit Ai < 0.4, an already proposed upper limit for unperturbed signals (7Scarselli M. Bernini A. Segoni C. Molinari H. Esposito G. Lesk A.M. Laschi F. Temussi P. Niccolai N. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 15: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), are related to hydrogens that have close contacts with the internal waters. The remaining 16 hydrogens with Ai < 0.4 can be divided in two groups. R1Hδ3, F4NH, Y23Hδ, Y23Hε, Q31Hγ3, Y35Hδ1, Q31Hβ3, and T54Hβ, although not completely buried, are sterically hindered with respect to the approach of a paramagnetic probe of the size of TEMPOL. Others, however, are surface hydrogens, i.e. Q31Hγ1, R39Hα, E49Hβ, C55Hα, and A58Hα, that are totally unhindered not only when viewed in a static picture but also in molecular dynamics simulations. The analysis of the reduced accessibility of these hydrogens is less straightforward, but it discloses a new scenario with respect to previous views of the surface of BPTI. The most direct explanation is the presence of water molecules with long residence times in close proximity to the poorly attenuated surface hydrogens. The presence of many hydrogen bond donor and/or acceptor groups near the latter nuclei is consistent for an ordered network of water molecules that prevents the close approach of TEMPOL to these surface sites.Figure 4Hydrogen environment of buried water molecules: three-dimensional models in which buried waters (highlighted) are surrounded by all the hydrogens within a 5 Å distance (a, BPTI ; b,tendamistat) are shown. In both cases, atoms are colored according to their paramagnetic attenuation (Ai) (see color bar). Gray refers to atoms whose missing Ai value is due to NOE absence, missing assignment, or spectral overlapping. The lack of detectable NOEs is observed only for hydrogens that are more than 4 Å distant from the water oxygen atom.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Only 7 tendamistat ePHOGSY signals exhibit paramagnetic attenuations < 0.4. The fact that this number of signals is very limited can be ascribed primarily to the absence of totally buried water molecules. However, water molecule W84 (according to the 1HOEwater numbering) buried in our reference model and conserved in 1HOEand 1BVN structures accounts for the low attenuations of K34Hα, V35NH, L44NH, and V56Hβ ePHOGSY signals (see Fig. 4 b). It is worth noting that the other three hydrogens whose Ai is <0.4, i.e. S21Hβ, D58NH, and R72NH, belong or are very close to polar groups. This feature can be related to the presence of strong hydration sites, which prevent a close approach of the paramagnetic probe, in agreement with that observed for BPTI. Previous TEMPOL-induced paramagnetic perturbation studies on tendamistat (7Scarselli M. Bernini A. Segoni C. Molinari H. Esposito G. Lesk A.M. Laschi F. Temussi P. Niccolai N. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 15: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and BPTI (17Molinari H. Esposito G. Pegna M. Ragona L. Niccolai N. Zetta L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 382-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) yielded an overall picture of accessibility to the two protein surfaces that suggests that the main features connected to accessibility were directly or indirectly linked to hydration properties. The main conclusions drawn from unfiltered perturbation studies can be summarized as follows: 1) few surface patches are highly accessible, including, in both cases, the protein active sites; 2) in general, for all of the analyzed protons, a good correlation was found between exposed surface areas and paramagnetic attenuations; and 3) whenever surface-exposed hydrogens exhibited only minor paramagnetic effects, the presence of a strong hydration site was invoked. The present water-filtered paramagnetic perturbation studies substantiate these findings and unveil additional fine aspects of surface accessibility. Despite the high percentage of hydrated surface that is expected for proteins from static observations (22Nakasako M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 547-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the NMR data indicate that only a small number of water molecules are statically close enough to protons of BPTI and tendamistat to affect their resonances. The solvent dynamics occurring at the surface of the two proteins is responsible for the limited number of water-protein interactions because too short residence times of water molecules quench the intermolecular Overhauser effects, whereas the lifetime of a close water-protein contact can be as long as 10−6 s for the internal waters of BPTI (23Denisov V.P. Halle B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 682-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) or even 10−3 s at 4 °C (11Otting G. Liepinsh E. Wüthrich K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4363-4364Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, tightly bound solvent molecules yield detectable NOEs, as in the case of all BPTI structural waters, such as the buried W111, W112, W113, and W122 and the partially buried W105, W110, W138, and W158. The same trend is observed for the NMR spectra of the structural and buried W84 of tendamistat, which is responsible for a large number of water-protein Overhauser effects (see Fig. 4 b). These NOEs are essentially unaffected by TEMPOL, confirming that paramagnetic perturbation studies of ePHOGSY signal intensities may be useful in finding structural waters. Furthermore, waters experiencing long residence times and not perturbed by TEMPOL, even when located on the protein surface, must be involved in strong hydration sites that prevent the approach of TEMPOL. However, the majority of the proton ePHOGSY signals, particularly the ones of tendamistat, experience Ai > 1, i.e. medium to strong paramagnetic effects arising from close encounters of these hydrogens with both water and TEMPOL molecules. The high selectivity attainable by ePHOGSY experiments in connection with paramagnetic perturbations is best exemplified by the possibility of explaining even minute discrepancies between expected and predicted accessible surface areas. The paramagnetic perturbation profile of the1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum of BPTI was obtained for only 37 resolved heteronuclear correlations Cα-Hα relevant correlations of individual α protons (17Molinari H. Esposito G. Pegna M. Ragona L. Niccolai N. Zetta L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 382-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The agreement between the paramagnetic attenuation (Ai) and accessible surface areas of BPTI α protons reported in the quoted paper was good in 24 cases. The remaining 13 discrepancies came from residues P2, F4, R39, K41, R42, and T54, whose Cα-Hα correlations exhibited paramagnetic attenuations smaller than the expected ones, whereas residues T11, C14, K15, R17, L29, V34, and G36 exhibited Ai values > accessible surface areas. This finding reflects the fact that the paramagnetic perturbation profiles are not simply related to the static hydrogen topology inferred from the protein structure. A direct comparison of the exposed surface areas of hydrogens of the various residues with the paramagnetic attenuations measured both in ePHOGSY and1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra yields information on differential accessibilities of the protein surface. Thus, the presence of tightly bound water molecules that prevent the approach of TEMPOL to BPTI can explain the Ai values observed for residues F4, R39, K41, R42, and T54 because they have one Overhauser effect with water, at least. In the case of P2, which is very close to the very hydrated F4, an indirect shielding from the paramagnetic probe could be effective. It is interesting to note that as shown by Fig. 5 a, all the residues with anomalous low attenuations are aligned on the same side of the protein surface. From Fig. 5 b, it is also apparent that residues T11, C14, K15, R17, V34, and G36, which are characterized by anomalously high attenuations, define a surface region centered on the protein active site. It is fair to conclude that an overall picture of protein surface accessibility, valid at least for the two chosen examples, is obtained by the combined use of the TEMPOL-induced paramagnetic perturbations on the 2D conventional spectra and the ePHOGSY or some other equivalent spectroscopy experiment. Thus, most of the water molecules involved in close contacts with proteins appear to be characterized by residence times short enough to prevent the onset of detectable Overhauser effects. Tightly bound water is never found near the protein active sites, which always result to be very TEMPOL accessible. This feature is of primary relevance because in this way it is experimentally confirmed that active sites are molecular regions that are very accessible by chemical species, even those that are quite different from the natural ligand. Almost all the surface-exposed regions showing NOE with water are also TEMPOL accessible, unless the solvent molecules are involved in the formation of strong hydration sites. Structural water molecules, which, in general, are buried and thus not at all perturbed by the paramagnetic probe, can be easily identified. It can be concluded, therefore, that from paramagnetic attenuation profiles of protein NMR spectra with and without water-protein dipolar-interaction editing, many critical characteristics of protein surface accessibility may be obtained. Thus, provided that the protein structure, (possibly in solution) is known, a new dimension of structural biology given by the protein accessibility can be explored. Detailed knowledge of all features of the protein surface is of utmost importance in all biological problems involving molecular recognition. As mentioned in the “Introduction,” a study of the surface of MNEI, sweet protein, by means of TEMPOL revealed the presence, on its surface, of interaction points that include residues previously predicted by ELISA tests and by mutagenesis (8Niccolai N. Spadaccini R. Scarselli M. Bernini A. Crescenzi O. Spiga O. Ciutti A. Di Maro D. Bracci L. Dalvit C. Temussi P.A. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1498-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). If we limit the discussion to the two main examples of this study, it can be said that a better understanding of the borders and properties of the surface areas of inhibitors can lead to the rational design of mutants with tailored specificity, a vital need in the case, for instance, of viral protease inhibitors. Obviously, other paramagnetic probes might be used, particularly in the case of redox protein systems, which can be affected by the weak oxidant properties of TEMPOL. We thank Hoechst AG for the kind gift of tendamistat."

Isoprenoids are a diverse family of lipid compounds made up of a repeating five-carbon structure called the isoprene unit. Protein prenylation generally consists of the attachment of either of two isoprenoids: the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl group or the 15-carbon farnesyl group (1Sinensky M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric G proteins (αβγ) are a class of prenylated proteins that mediate the majority of neurohormonal signaling pathways in mammals. Upon G protein activation by a cell surface receptor, both the α subunit and the βγ complex of a G protein can regulate downstream effectors (2Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The γ subunit of Gβγ is modified with either a geranylgeranyl group or a farnesyl group (3Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The isoprenoid is added to a conserved cysteine residue at position −4 from the C-terminal end of the protein, in a consensus motif for prenylation called the CAA X box. The last amino acid in the motif (X) determines whether the cysteine is geranylgeranylated or farnesylated. Most γ subunits are geranylgeranylated, but γ1, γc, and γ11 are farnesylated (3Gautam N. Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The role of prenylation of the γ subunit in G protein function is still unclear. As with several other proteins, it has been established that the prenyl group on the G protein βγ complex plays a role in anchoring the protein to lipid membranes; βγ complexes mutated at the cysteine residue in the CAA X box of the γ subunit no longer associate with the plasma membrane and are located in the cytosol (4Simonds W.F. Butrynski J.E. Gautam N. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5363-5366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pronin A.N. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is thought that the hydrophobic prenyl moiety associates with lipid membranes through lipid-lipid interactions, thus acting as a membrane anchor for proteins. In addition to lipid-lipid interactions, there have been suggestions from studies on small GTP-binding proteins that the prenyl moiety may also interact with proteins and stabilize protein-protein interactions (1Sinensky M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It is not yet known whether the prenyl moiety of the G protein γ subunit is involved in direct interactions with proteins, although prenylation has been shown to be necessary for βγ interaction with receptors and effectors in a number of systems. The γ subunit prenyl group has been shown to be a requirement for receptor activation of a G protein (6Fukada Y. Takao T. Ohguro H. Yoshizawa T. Akino T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1990; 346: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Prenylated peptides specific to the C-terminal region of the γ subunits have been shown to interact with receptors (7Kisselev O.G. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Prenylation of these peptides was a requirement for this activity. Similar to this requirement in the case of receptors, prenylation of Gβγ has been shown to be a requirement for effector interaction also. Gβγ containing a mutant unprenylated γ subunit does not activate PLCβ21 either in vivo or in vitro (9Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 10Dietrich A. Brazil D. Jensen O.N. Meister M. Schrader M. Moomaw J.F. Mann M. Illenberger D. Gierschik P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15174-15182Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Unprenylated βγ complex also does not stimulate adenylyl cyclase type II or inhibit adenylyl cyclase type I (11Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in all of these studies, the receptors or effectors were either integral membrane proteins (receptor and adenylyl cyclases) or membrane-associated proteins that required lipids as substrates (PLCβ isozymes). It has thus been unclear whether the prenyl group requirement facilitated βγ complex-membrane interaction or βγ complex interaction with receptor/effector protein. Previous results have implied that the γ subunit prenyl moiety interacts directly with proteins. For instance, γ subunit peptides modified with isoprenoids of varying chain lengths differed in their ability to stabilize activated rhodopsin (12Kisselev O. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25356-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, there was no direct correlation between overall hydrophobicity with the efficacy of the modified peptides in the receptor stabilization assays. Farnesylated peptides were more active than geranylated (C-10) or geranylgeranylated peptides. These results indicated that the function of the prenyl moiety was more likely stabilization of protein interactions rather than membrane binding. The altered activity of mutant Gβγ with prenyl moieties switched from geranylgeranyl to farnesyl or vice versa also implied that the prenyl moiety may be involved in protein interaction (13Myung C.S. Yasuda H. Liu W.W. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16595-16603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Overall, the question of whether the prenyl group plays this important role of stabilizing G protein-receptor or G protein-effector interactions in addition to stabilizing contact with the membrane has remained unresolved. The recent solution of a crystal structure of prenylated Cdc42, a Rho family member, bound to RhoGDI provides the first direct evidence for specific contact between the prenyl moiety and an interacting protein. In this crystal structure, the geranylgeranyl group of Cdc42 occupies a hydrophobic pocket in RhoGDI (14Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). To examine whether the γ subunit prenyl group is directly involved in interaction with a G protein effector, we synthesized prenylated peptides specific to γ subunits. These peptides were then tested for their ability to compete with Gβγ in activation assays of PLCβ2 and PLCβ3. PLCβ enzymes are a family of proteins that hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), releasing the second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (15Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). They are regulated by both G protein α subunits (of the Gq class) and the βγ complex (16Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The results from the peptide inhibition assays suggest that the prenylated γ peptides compete with the βγ complex for a site on PLCβ. A fluorescence-based binding assay confirmed direct interaction of the prenylated γ peptide with PLCβ. To examine the role of the γ prenyl moiety within the context of the whole βγ complex, we then compared a mutant unprenylated βγ complex with prenylated βγ complex in FRET based assays, which measured direct binding to PLCβ isozymes in a highly quantitative fashion. The results from these experiments provide strong evidence that the γ subunit prenyl group directly facilitates interaction of Gβγ with PLCβ. PIP2 and phosphatidylethanolamine were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. [3H] PIP2 was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was from Qiagen. All other reagents were from Sigma. Details of the construction of baculoviruses expressing His-PLCβ2, His-PLCβ3, G protein His-αi2, αq, β1 subunit, β4 subunit, γ2 subunit, His-γ2 subunit, and mutant (C68S) unprenylated γ2 subunit have been published (11Iniguez-Lluhi J.A.

Purification of βγ subunits was performed essentially as described before (21Hou Y. Chang V. Capper A.B. Taussig R. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19982-19988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells simultaneously infected with β4 and His-γ2 baculoviruses were lysed by nitrogen cavitation, and the membranes were extracted with 1% cholate. The detergent extract was applied to a column of nickel resin nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, washed with buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% polyoxyethylene 10 lauryl ether (C12E10) (Sigma) and 10 mmimidazole. βγ complex was eluted with buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl, 1% cholate, and 250 mm imidazole. Peak fractions were concentrated to a final concentration of 1–2 mg/ml. Sf9 cells were co-infected with baculoviruses expressing His-αi2, β1, and γ2. The cells were lysed and proteins peripherally associated with membranes isolated as described before (21Hou Y. Chang V. Capper A.B. Taussig R. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19982-19988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracted proteins were bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Bound βγ complex is eluted using aluminum fluoride. Peak fractions were dialyzed and concentrated into 20 mmHepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mmMgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.7% CHAPS. Purification of mutant unprenylated β1γ2 was performed using a modification of the procedure described in Ref. 22Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar. Sf9 cells co-infected with baculoviruses expressing β1 and γ2C68S were lysed, and the soluble fraction was subjected to sequential chromatography over Q-Sepharose and hydroxylapatite. αq was purified as described before (17Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gαq was expressed in Sf9 cells using a recombinant baculovirus. To ensure stability of the Gα subunit, Sf9 cells were also co-infected with baculoviruses expressing β and γ subunits. αq was purified from membrane extracts by sequential chromatographic steps as described before. PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 were purified as described previously (19Romoser V. Ball R. A V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing histidine-tagged PLCβ2 or histidine-tagged PLCβ3. PLCβ proteins were purified from cell extracts by nickel chromatography. Peptides were synthesized, chemically geranylgeranylated or farnesylated, and purified as described (23Azpiazu I. Gautam N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). The geranylgeranyl-bromide was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Farnesyl was obtained from Aldrich. Briefly, peptide (2 μmol) and prenyl bromide (4 μmol) were mixed in a solution of butanol:methanol:water (1:1:1) previously purged under nitrogen atmosphere. Butyl-hydroxytoluene was provided as an antioxidant. The reaction was started with 0.5 m sodium carbonate. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere, in the dark with continuous agitation for 18 and 24 h. The reaction was stopped with acetic acid, and the samples were frozen at −85 °C. Prenylated peptides are purified by reverse chromatography on a PepRPC fast protein liquid chromatography column HR 10/16 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a linear (0–100%) gradient of acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The prenylated compounds elute at a position of the gradient corresponding to approximately 50–60% acetonitrile content. Farnesylated peptides elute earlier than their geranylgeranylated counterparts. Peptides were usually converted to prenyl peptide with a 30–50% yield, which after purification and other operations resulted in a yield of 15–25% neat prenylated peptide. Prenyl peptides were stored in butanol:methanol:water (1:1:1, volume) or dimethylsulfoxide at −85 °C. The molecular masses of the prenylated peptide was checked by mass spectrometry. The concentration of the peptide was determined by amino acid analysis. The integrity of the modified peptides in stocks was checked regularly by chromatography in a PepRPC column by fast protein liquid chromatography. βγ stimulation of phospholipase Cβ was performed as described previously (19Romoser V. Ball R. A V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Prenylated peptides were stored in a 1:1:1 solution of butanol:methanol:water at −80 °C. Appropriate amounts were added to tubes and vacuum dried to remove the organic solvents. Peptides were then solubilized by sonication in presonicated lipid substrate (50 μm PIP2, 200 μmphosphatidylethanolamine, and [3H]PIP2; ∼8000 cpm/assay). 120 pm PLCβ2 and 100 nmfinal concentration of β4γ2 were then added to the lipid vesicle/peptide mix. The reactions were started by addition of CaCl2 and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and bovine serum albumin was added to precipitate proteins and lipids. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate remained in the supernatant, and [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate release was quantitated by scintillation counting. Peptide inhibition of βγ complex-stimulated PLCβ3 activity was performed as above with 600 pm PLCβ3 and 10 nm final concentration β4γ2 per assay. αq activation of PLCβ3 was performed essentially as described (17Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that αq was preactivated by incubation with 10 mm NaF and 30 μm AlCl3. Peptide effect on αq stimulation of PLCβ3 was tested as above; 5 μm γ2-gg peptide was used for these assays. Association between PLCβ2 and Gβ1γ2 or peptide was quantified by fluorescence (24Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All studies were done in the presence of extruded lipids (diameter, 100 nm) composed of either 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phosphoserine] (POPS) or a 2:1 mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phosphocholine] and POPS. The inclusion of lipid was solely to promote solubility of Gβγ and of the prenylated peptide. Gβγ complexes (wild type or mutant) were reconstituted into membranes by adding concentrated lipid solution to detergent solubilized βγ complex and then removing the detergent by dialysis. Fluorescence studies were carried out by labeling PLCβ and Gβγ with an amine-reactive coumarin or DABCYL (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) by adding a 3–4-fold excess of probe to the proteins at pH 8.0, incubating for 30 min, and removing unreacted probe by dialysis (25Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PLCβ and βγ activity were independently assayed using labeled and unlabeled proteins to ensure that labeling did not affect activity. Titrations were carried out by placing 120 μl of sample in a 3-mm-path length cell and adding small (0.5–2 μl) amounts of the titrating solution. The peptide was dried down with nitrogen and resuspended in the reaction mix or added directly in solution depending on the concentration. Spectra were taken on an ISS spectrofluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 340 for coumarin fluorescence and scanning from 380 to 500, and protein association was analyzed as described below. Membrane binding of unprenylated Gβγ was measured by the 35% decrease in intrinsic fluorescence, exciting at 280 nm, and scanning from 290–400, because lipid bilayers composed of POPS were added to a 120 nm protein solution (24Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Association was highly dependent on membrane surface charge and ionic conditions. The partition coefficient of the βγ complex for POPS bilayers at 160m KCl was found to be 50 + 4 μm(n = 2). Binding of the peptide to coumarin-PLCβ was analyzed by the shift in the emission energy as unlabeled peptide was added to the coumarin-PLCβ solution. In the FRET assays, association of coumarin-Gβγ with DABCYL-PLCβ was measured by following the decrease in donor emission (coumarin-Gβγ) during the addition of a nonfluorescent energy transfer acceptor (DABCYL-PLCβ). Association between PLCβ and the peptide or Gβγ was analyzed by a simple bimolecular association. Here, we report only the apparent dissociation constant and do not take into account that the proteins maybe interacting on a quasi-two dimensional membrane surface. Using the PLCβ2-Gβγ association as an example, for bulk phase equilibria the association between PLCβ2 and Gβγ is as follows.[PLCβ]+[Gβγ]=[PLCβ−Gβγ]Kd=[Gβγ][PLCβ][Gβγ−PLCβ]Eq. 1 The total amount of Gβγ in solution is [Gβγ]0 = [Gβγ] + [Gβγ·PLCβ], and, similarly, the total amount of PLCβ is [PLCβ]0 = [PLCβ] + [Gβγ·PLCβ]. The degree of association (α) of PLCβ with Gβγ is calculated from the normalized ratio of the change in fluorescence properties at each point along the titration curve over the total change for the association. Thus, Kd can be calculated from α by the following equation.Kd=[Gβγ0](χ−α)(1−α)αEq. 2 We examined the ability of prenylated peptides specific to the C terminus of the γ2 subunit type to inhibit βγ activation of PLCβ2 and PLCβ3. If a PLCβ isozyme makes direct contact with the prenyl group of the γ subunit during interaction with the βγ complex, then prenylated peptides from the γ subunit should block such interaction. The sequence of the γ subunit peptides and their prenyl modifications are shown in Fig. 1. The γ2 peptide corresponds to the C-terminal 12 amino acids of the mature, fully processed γ2 subunit. This peptide was either left unmodified or chemically prenylated at the last cysteine with either a geranylgeranyl group (γ2-gg) or a farnesyl group (γ2-far). The geranylgeranyl group is the isoprenoid present on native γ2 subunits (26Yamane H.K. Farnsworth C.C. Xie H.Y. Howald W. Fung B.K. Clarke S. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5868-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We used the β4γ2 complex in these assays. β4γ2 stimulates both PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 with the same efficacy as β1γ2 under identical conditions (21Hou Y. Chang V. Capper A.B. Taussig R. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19982-19988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Basal activities of these PLCβ isozymes were 10–20% of Gβγ-stimulated activity under the conditions used. When tested, the γ2-gg peptide completely inhibits Gβγ stimulation of both PLCβ2 and PLCβ3, reducing PLCβ activity to basal levels. (Fig. 2). The γ2-gg peptide did not have any significant effect on basal activity of PLCβ2 (data not shown).Figure 2Geranylgeranylated γ2 peptide inhibits βγ stimulation of PLCβ isozymes. A, effect of increasing concentrations of γ2-gg peptide on βγ stimulation of PLCβ2. 100 nm β4γ2 complex and 120 pmPLCβ2 were incubated with lipid substrate and varying concentrations of γ2-gg peptide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reactions were started by addition of CaCl2 and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The results shown are the means of duplicate samples and are expressed as percentages of βγ-stimulated PLCβ2 activity in the absence of peptide. This plot is representative of four independent experiments. B, effect of increasing concentrations of γ2-gg peptide on βγ stimulation of PLCβ3. The reactions were performed as in A, but with 10 nmβ4γ2 complex and 600 pm PLCβ3. The results shown are the means of duplicate samples and are expressed as percentages of βγ-stimulated PLCβ3 activity in the absence of peptide. This plot is representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) γ2-gg peptide inhibition of βγ stimulation could be due to the hydrophobic prenyl group causing a general disturbance of lipid vesicles in the assay, preventing the PLCβ isozymes from accessing their lipid substrate or from a direct action upon PLCβ isozymes. To resolve this issue, we examined the effect of the γ2-gg peptide on Gαq stimulation of phospholipase Cβ3. The G protein α subunit type, Gαq, is known to strongly stimulate PLCβ3 and is thought to do so by a mechanism different from that of Gβγ stimulation (27Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). αq-binding and βγ-binding regions on PLCβ2 have been mapped and are distinct from one another (28Lee S.B. Shin S.H. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Blank J.L. Shaw K. Ross A.H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25184-25191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The γ2-gg peptide does not significantly affect αq stimulation of PLCβ3, even at a concentration of peptide that completely inhibits βγ stimulation of PLCβ3 (5 μm) (Fig. 3). This indicates that the effect of the peptide is not the result of either direct inhibition of PLCβ activity or nonspecific disruption of enzyme access to substrate. We next examined the relative contributions of both the geranylgeranyl group and the amino acid portion of the γ2-gg peptide in mediating this inhibitory effect. Unprenylated γ2 peptide had very little effect on βγ complex stimulation of either PLCβ2 or PLCβ3, even at a concentration of 20 μm (Fig.4 A). At this concentration γ2-gg inhibits Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ activity almost completely (Fig. 2). Thus, the prenyl moiety is essential for γ2-gg inhibition of Gβγ action on PLCβ. To determine whether or not the prenyl moiety alone is sufficient for inhibition of βγ stimulation of PLCβ, we initially worked with a prenylated cysteine compound. However, problems with solubility of the prenylcysteine prevented further study with this compound. Therefore, to determine the importance of the amino acid sequence in γ2-gg inhibition of Gβγ activity, we synthesized a geranylgeranylated γ2 peptide in which the amino acid sequence of the last 12 residues of the γ2 subunit was randomized (γ2scr-gg). This scrambled peptide inhibited Gβγ stimulation of PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 as well as the wild type γ2-gg peptide (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the amino acid sequence of the γ2-gg peptide is not important for its inhibitory effect on Gβγ stimulation of PLCβ isozymes. This result is consistent with previous data suggesting that it is the prenyl moiety and not the amino acid sequence of γ subunits that is the prime determinant on γ subunits for Gβγ interaction with PLCβ (13Myung C.S. Yasuda H. Liu W.W. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16595-16603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Inhibition of βγ stimulation of PLCβ isozymes by geranylgeranylated peptides suggests that PLCβ isozymes may directly contact the prenyl moiety on the G protein γ subunit during activation by the βγ complex. A fluorescence-based binding method was used to determine direct interaction of the γ2-gg peptide with PLCβ2. PLCβ2 was labeled with the fluorescent probe coumarin, whose emission energy and intensity were found to be highly sensitive to the addition of prenylated y2-gg but not its unprenylated counterpart. Specifically, the addition of unlabeled γ2-gg peptide produced a 2-fold increase in the emission intensity and a significant shift (330 cm−1) of emission energy from coumarin-labeled PLCβ (Fig. 5). These shifts allowed us to monitor the association between the peptide and PLCβ2 without the need to attach a fluorescent label on the peptide that could affect its interaction with PLCβ. The addition of unprenylated γ2 peptide resulted in no change in emission energy (data not shown). To verify that the changes in fluorescence reflected a true interaction of peptide with protein, the association of γ2-gg with PLCβ2 was measured at two concentrations of PLCβ2. Upon an increase of PLCβ2 concentration from 5 to 30 nm, the titration curve shifted in the expected direction to the right (Fig. 5). Curves were fit to a bimolecular association constant, giving values of Kd (1.8 ± 0.9 and 5.7 ± 3.1 μm) that were not significantly different from each other. To directly assess the importance of the isoprenoid group in βγ interaction with PLCβ isozymes, we performed a direct binding assay with PLCβ3 and prenylated or unprenylated βγ complexes. Wild type γ2 protein was co-expressed with β1 protein, and the complex was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Unprenylated βγ complex was synthesized by mutating the γ2 subunit C-terminal cysteine at position 68 to serine. This mutation prevents normal prenylation of the γ subunit without affecting its ability to bind to the β subunit (6Fukada Y. Takao T. Ohguro H. Yoshizawa T. Akino T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1990; 346: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Mutant unprenylated γ2 protein was co-expressed with β1 protein using the baculovirus insect cell expression system, and the resulting βγ complex was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Unprenylated β1γ2 was completely inactive in PLCβ3 assays, even at concentrations at which wild type β4γ2 stimulation of PLCβ3 saturates (Fig.6) (as mentioned before β4γ2 has similar potency compared with β1γ2 in activating PLCβ3). We then examined whether prenylation is necessary for direct binding of β1γ2 to PLCβ. Direct binding between PLCβ and Gβγ was assayed using FRET assays. Wild type and unprenylated β1γ2 complex were labeled with the fluorescent donor probe, coumarin. PLCβ2 was labeled with the acceptor probe, DABCYL. We have previously measured the affinities between PLCβ2 and Gβγ on membrane surfaces by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and found the membrane concentration to be a critical determinant in the magnitude of the their interaction energies (24Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although prenylation of the βγ complex has been shown to increase the affinity of the complex for cell membranes (5Pronin A.N. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we found that is possible to conduct binding studies under conditions of lipid concentrations (200 μm POPS) (24Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) where both prenylated and unprenylated complexes are both completely bound to lipid vesicles. Preliminary studies showed that binding of unprenylated βγ complex to negatively charged lipid bilayers composed of POPS was very strong (Kp = ∼50 μm) and in the same range as previously determined for prenylated Gβγ (24Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In Fig.7, a comparison of the binding of DABCYL-PLCβ2 to coumarin-labeled wild type or unprenylated Gβγ as measured by FRET is shown. These results show clearly that the affinity of prenylated βγ for PLCβ is significantly higher compared with the unprenylated βγ complex. The results from these FRET based assays indicate that the γ prenyl moiety is essential for direct interaction between the βγ complex and PLCβ isozymes. The results also suggest that there exists a site on PLCβ isozymes that binds the G protein γ subunit geranylgeranyl moiety. To test whether such a site specifically recognizes the geranylgeranyl group, we substituted the geranylgeranyl moiety in the γ2 peptide with a farnesyl group (γ2-far). γ2-far is consistently less effective than γ2-gg in inhibiting βγ activation of PLCβ3 (Fig. 8), indicating that if a site on the PLCβ enzymes binds the prenyl moiety, it can discriminate between geranylgeranyl and farnesyl isoprenoids. What is the nature of the prenyl group involvement in interaction between βγ and PLCβ isozymes? As confirmed here (Fig. 6), it is known that prenylation of the βγ complex is required for functional regulation of PLCβ (9Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 10Dietrich A. Brazil D. Jensen O.N. Meister M. Schrader M. Moomaw J.F. Mann M. Illenberger D. Gierschik P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15174-15182Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because PLCβ acts on lipid substrates, it is possible that the requirement for prenylation is due the targeting of the βγ complex to membranes. However, it is also possible that the γ subunit prenyl moiety interacts directly with PLCβ and thus stabilizes protein-protein interactions between the βγ complex and PLCβ. Τhe results presented here favor this latter possibility. Inhibition of βγ stimulation of PLCβ activity by prenylated peptides suggests that the prenylated peptides compete with βγ for a native prenyl-binding site on PLCβ isozymes. The effect of these prenylated peptides is specific; the same peptides have no effect on either basal or, more importantly, αq-stimulated PLCβ3 activity. The differing efficacies of geranylgeranylated and farnesylated peptides on PLCβ activity is consistent with previous experiments using whole proteins (13Myung C.S. Yasuda H. Liu W.W. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16595-16603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and suggest that such a prenyl-binding site can discriminate between different types of isoprenoids. Furthermore, the ∼3-fold difference between the efficacy of the farnesylated and geranylgeranylated peptides (IC50 values of ∼ 5 and ∼1.8 μm) is strikingly similar to the 3-fold difference in the Kd of farnesyl and geranylgeranyl for rhoGDI (4.8 and 1.6 μm as determined in a fluorescence based assay) (14Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Although the potential site on PLCβ can discriminate between different isoprenoids, our results demonstrate that it does not selectively bind a particular isoprenoid to the exclusion of a related molecule. Lipid-protein interactions are predominantly hydrophobic (14Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar,30Park H.W. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It is likely that the chemistry of these interactions will not allow for the kind of specificity seen in protein-protein interactions. Experiments that examined the effect of γ subunit-specific peptides on fluorescence emission from fluorophore-tagged PLCβ provide direct evidence for interaction between the geranylgeranyl moiety and the PLCβ molecule. In this assay, only the γ2-gg peptide induced a significant increase in emission energy from PLCβ2. Unprenylated γ2 peptide had no effect on fluorescence emission from PLCβ. Because increases in emission energy are directly related to complex formation between the molecules in the assay (24Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the Kd for γ2-gg binding to PLCβ2 could be determined (1.8 ± 0.9 to 5.7 ± 3.1 μm). The differential binding of prenylated and unprenylated γ2 peptide in this assay reflects similar differences in the assays that measured inhibition of Gβγ-stimulated PLCβ activity by the peptides. Because the unprenylated γ2-gg peptide has no effect on fluorescence emission from coumarin-tagged PLCβ2, these results indicate that interaction of a site on PLCβ with the prenyl moiety is at the basis of γ2-gg peptide binding to PLCβ. The results from experiments using the whole βγ complex, wild type and mutant, provide further evidence for the interaction of the prenyl moiety with PLCβ. A strong FRET signal is detected from DABCYL-tagged PLCβ2 in the presence of coumarin-tagged prenylated βγ complex. The FRET response to increasing concentrations of PLCβ indicate highly effective complex formation complex formation;KD for complex formation between prenylated βγ and PLCβ was 0.9 nm. Complex formation between unprenylated Gβγ and PLCβ was significantly weakened (estimated Kd = 239 nm). The affinity of prenylated Gβγ is thus about 200-fold stronger for PLCβ compared with unprenylated mutant Gβγ. Unprenylated Gβγ complex consistently interacted with weaker affinity for PLCβ even under assay conditions where all of the unprenylated βγ complex was localized along with PLCβ to lipid surfaces (Fig. 7). Thus, differential interaction of prenylated and unprenylated βγ complexes with PLCβ is not a consequence of their differential interaction with membranes. Together these results from fluorescence spectroscopy directly support a role for the prenyl modification in stabilizing βγ complex-PLCβ interaction. In summary, the results presented here demonstrate that the γ subunit prenyl moiety directly facilitates interaction of the G protein βγ complex with an effector, PLCβ. We predict that PLCβ has a site that specifically binds the prenyl group. The interaction of the G protein γ subunit prenyl moiety with PLCβ may serve as a general model for isoprenoid-protein interactions. We thank Dr. Y. Hou (Gautam Laboratory) for pure β1γ2 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2060665340,"Replication factor C is required to load proliferating cell nuclear antigen onto primer-template junctions, using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Four of the five RFCgenes have consensus ATP-binding motifs. To determine the relative importance of these sites for proper DNA metabolism in the cell, the conserved lysine in the Walker A motif of RFC1,RFC2, RFC3, or RFC4 was mutated to either arginine or glutamic acid. Arginine mutations in allRFC genes tested permitted cell growth, although poor growth was observed for rfc2-K71R. A glutamic acid substitution resulted in lethality in RFC2 andRFC3 but not in RFC1 or RFC4. Most double mutants combining mutations in two RFC genes were inviable. Except for the rfc1-K359R andrfc4-K55E mutants, which were phenotypically similar to wild type in every assay, the mutants were sensitive to DNA-damaging agents. The rfc2-K71R and rfc4-K55R mutants show checkpoint defects, most likely in the intra-S phase checkpoint. Regulation of the damage-inducible RNR3 promoter was impaired in these mutants, and phosphorylation of Rad53p in response to DNA damage was specifically defective when cells were in S phase. No dramatic defects in telomere length regulation were detected in the mutants. These data demonstrate that the ATP binding function ofRFC2 is important for both DNA replication and checkpoint function and, for the first time, that RFC4 also plays a role in checkpoint regulation.

RFC in yeast is a heteropentamer that consists of a large subunit (Rfc1, 95 kDa) and four small subunits (Rfc2–Rfc5, 36–40 kDa). The yeast Rfc subunits are all quite similar to each other at the amino acid level (24–37%) and to the human Rfc subunits. However, each yeast subunit shares the highest degree of sequence homology with the analogous subunit from human RFC (reviewed in Ref. 1Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity is localized to the N-terminal half of the subunits in regions termed RFC boxes II–VIII. Most notable are the putative ATP-binding motifs in boxes III and V. The amino acids in box III, the Walker A motif, create a characteristic fold, the P loop, which forms a pocket for binding of the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP (2Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 3Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Our biochemical studies reported in the second paper (4Gomes X.V. Gary Schmidt S.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34776-34783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar) of this series show that four ATP molecules can bind to RFC when PCNA and primer-template DNA are also present. This coincides with our current understanding of the primary sequence determinants of ATP-binding domains, which indicates that four of the five subunits comprising the RFC complex contain consensus ATP-binding motifs. (see Fig.1 A). The Rfc5 subunit lacks critical residues in both the A and B motifs and therefore this domain may have a more structural function analogous to the δ′ subunit of Escherichia coliDNA polymerase III holoenzyme (5Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Mutation of the conserved lysine residue to glutamic acid in theRFC1, RFC2, RFC3, orRFC4 gene resulted in mutant RFC complexes with varying defects in in vitro assays. Complete loss of clamp loading activity was observed in the RFC-2E complex (containing Rfc2-K71E), and the RFC-3E complex (containing Rfc3-K59E) displayed only marginal activity (6Gary Schmidt S.L. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34784-34791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The RFC-4E complex (containing Rfc4-K55E) showed primarily a severe Km defect for ATP binding, and the biochemical studies indicated that ATP binding to the Rfc4 subunit is essential for clamp loading. Surprisingly, however, the RFC-1E complex (containing Rfc1-K359E) was essentially like wild type, contrasting sharply with reports of similar mutations in human RFC, which abrogated the clamp loading activity of the mutant complex, and suggesting that ATP binding to Rfc1 is not essential for clamp loading in yeast (6Gary Schmidt S.L.

In addition to the role of RFC in DNA replication, several of its subunits appear to be involved in DNA repair (Ref. 9McAlear M.A. Tuffo K.M. Holm C. Genetics. 1996; 142: 65-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and this study) as well as checkpoint regulation. The cells progress through the cell cycle in an orderly fashion with late events dependent upon the successful completion of early events. When incompletely replicated DNA or DNA damage is detected, a checkpoint is activated until DNA synthesis is complete or the damage has been repaired. Mutations in two components of the budding yeast RFC complex, RFC2 (10Noskov V.N. Araki H. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4914-4923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andRFC5 (11Sugimoto K.

Cell. 1999; 10: 3991-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have revealed a role for RFC in checkpoint regulation. In addition, mutations in other DNA replication genes, namely the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase ε, POL2 (15Navas T.A. Sanchez Y. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2632-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and a polymerase ε associated gene DPB11 (16Araki H. Leem S.H. Phongdara A. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1999; 96: 3824-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), show defects in the S phase checkpoint. Our biochemical analysis has shown that ATP binding to the Rfc2, Rfc3, and Rfc4 subunits is required for clamp loading, whereas ATP binding to the Rfc1 subunit is dispensable for this process in vitro. To determine whether these properties reflect those inside the cell or whether ATP binding to Rfc subunits drives alternative pathways, we have carried out a complementary genetic analysis of RFC ATP-binding mutants. We have examined the in vivo phenotypes of both Lys → Glu and Lys → Arg mutations in the ATP-binding motifs of theRFC1, RFC2, RFC3, and RFC4genes. The results of the genetic studies indicate that intact ATP-binding motifs are critical in RFC2 and RFC3. RFC2 and RFC4 mutants are defective in response to DNA damage, indicating roles for these subunits in checkpoint regulation. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Standard growth media and yeast genetic techniques were used. RFC2, RFC3, andRFC4 deletion strains were created in the diploid strain W303 (a gift from H. Klein). This strain was renamed PY73. PY90 and PY91 were created by transforming PY73 with aSalI/NheI digest of plasmids pBL628 and pBL627A, respectively. Complementing plasmid pBL615 was transformed into the diploid transformants, and appropriate spores were collected. PY92 was made by transforming PY73 with a BsiWI/PvuII digest of plasmid pBL629A, followed by transformation with pBL617 and spore collection. PY94 was created in PY73 using a polymerase chain reaction disruption method with pFA6a-kanMX6 (a generous gift from A. Wach) (18Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). pBL619 was transformed into the diploid strain, and appropriate spores were collected. PY96-K71R/K55E was created by mating PY91 with PY94-E, sporulating, and identifying the appropriate haploids, followed by transformation with pBL630-R and a plasmid shuffle on 5-fluoroorotic acid. PY103 is strain CH1578 (a generous gift from C. Holm) that contains pBL641 in place of pCH1160. PY98-K359R/K71R was created by mating PY103 with PY90-R, sporulating, and identifying the appropriate his− haploids, followed by transformation with pBL643-R and a plasmid shuffle on 5-fluoroorotic acid. PY99-K359R/K59R was created by mating PY103 with PY92-R, sporulating, and identifying the appropriate his− haploids. The strain was transformed with pBL632 followed by growth to identify cells that had lost the TRP1 plasmid (pBL623). Finally, the strain was transformed with pBL642-R and a plasmid shuffle on 5-fluoroorotic acid was performed. PY100–359R/K55E was created by mating PY103 with PY94-E, sporulating, and identifying the appropriate his−haploids. The strain was transformed with pBL633-E followed by growth to identify cells that had lost the TRP1 plasmid (pBL626). Finally, the strain was transformed with pBL642-R, and a plasmid shuffle on 5-fluoroorotic acid was performed. All strains were confirmed by Southern analysis. E. coli strains used include DH5, ABLE C (Stratagene), XL1-Blue, and BW313 (dut ung).Table IStrainsPY73 (W303)MATa/αade2–1 his3–11,15 ura3–1 trp1–1 leu2–3,112 can1–100PY90MATα, as PY73, but ΔRFC2∷kanMX6 + [pBL615]PY90-KPY90 + [pBL616] − [pBL615]PY90-RPY90 + [pBL621] − [pBL615]PY91MATα, as PY73, but ΔRFC2∷hisG + [pBL615]PY91-KPY91 + [pBL616] − [pBL615]PY91-RPY91 + [pBL621] − [pBL615]PY92MATa, as PY73, but ΔRFC3∷kanMX6 + [pBL617]PY92-KPY92 + [pBL618] − [pBL617]PY92-RPY92 + [pBL623] − [pBL617]PY94MATa, as PY73, but ΔRFC4∷kanMX6 + [pBL619]PY94-KPY94 + [pBL620] − [pBL619]PY94-EPY94 + [pBL626] − [pBL619]PY94-RPY94 + [pBL625] − [pBL619]PY96–71R/55EMATa, as PY73, but ΔRFC2∷hisG, ΔRFC4∷kanMX6 + [pBL630-R] + [pBL626]PY98–359R/71RMATα ade2–1 his3–11,15 ura3 trp1 leu2 ΔRFC1∷LEU2 ΔRFC2∷kanMX6 + [pBL643-R] + [pBL621]PY99–359R/59RMATα ade2–1 his3–11,15 ura3 trp1 leu2 ΔRFC1∷LEU2 ΔRFC3∷kanMX6 + [pBL642-R] + [pBL632]PY100–359R/55EMATα ade2–1 his3–11,15 ura3 trp1 leu2 ΔRFC1∷LEU2 ΔRFC4∷kanMX6 + [pBL642-R] + [pBL633-E]PY103MATa, leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 ura3–52 ΔRFC1∷LEU2 + [pBL641]PY103-KPY103 + [pBL642] − [pBL641]PY103-EPY103 + [pBL642-E] − [pBL641]PY103-RPY103 + [pBL642-R] − [pBL641]For simplicity only viable strains are listed.

The plasmids used throughout this study are listed in Table II. pBL641 (RFC1,URA3) is a complementing plasmid containing the entireRFC1 sequence and was created by cloning a 922-bpBamHI/BglII fragment containing the N terminus ofRFC1 into the BamHI site of plasmid pCH1160 (19Howell E.A. McAlear M.A. Rose D. Holm C. Mol. Cell.

Klein M.B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 905-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and extending the primers with T7 DNA polymerase, followed by ligation. These extension reactions were transformed into E. coli strain XL1-Blue. Isolates carrying the mutations were identified by digestion of plasmid DNA with BsiWI (K359R) orBsmAI (K359E). Isolates identified by restriction analysis were confirmed by sequencing. pBL643-R (rfc1-K359R,HIS3) was created by cloning the 5365-bp PvuI fragment from pBL642 into the 3054-bp fragment of pRS313. pBL643-E (rfc1-K359E, HIS3) was created in yeast as follows. pBL642-E was cotransformed into yeast strain PY73 with the 4522-bp PvuII fragment from pRS313.

Leem S.H. Phongdara A. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11791-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Plasmids were created such that the RFC2 and RFC3mutants could be overproduced under control of the GAL1/10promoter. pBL412-R (GAL1/10-rfc2-K71R,URA3) and pBL412-E (GAL1/10-rfc2-K71E,URA3) were created by replacing the 338-bpPflMI/NheI in pBL412 with the same fragment from pBL621 or pBL622, respectively. pBL413-R (GAL1/10-rfc3-K59R, LEU2) and pBL413-E (GAL1/10-rfc3-K59E, LEU2) were created by replacing the 397-bp MscI/NcoI fragment of pBL413 with the same fragment from pBL623 or pBL624, respectively. pBL627A contains the RFC2 gene, which has been disrupted by inserting a hisG-URA3-hisG cassette into theNdeI/HpaI sites of RFC2 in pBL616. pBL628 contains the RFC2 gene, which has been disrupted by inserting the kanMX6 gene into theNdeI/HpaI sites of RFC2 in pBS-RFC2. Plasmid pBL457 contains the RFC3 gene, which has been disrupted by inserting a hisG-URA3-hisG cassette into theEcoNI/NcoI sites of RFC3 in plasmid pBL452 (2Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). pBL629 contains the RFC3 gene, which has been disrupted by inserting the kanMX6 gene (50) into theEcoNI/NcoI sites of RFC3 in pBL452. Sensitivity of the mutants to growth on methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or MMS survival curves, sensitivity of the mutants to growth on hydroxyurea-containing medium, or sensitivity to UV irradiation was determined as described previously (21Ayyagari R. Impellizzeri K.J. Yoder B.L. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4420-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Plasmid pZZ2 (RNR3-lacZ,URA3, CEN4, ARS1) was a gift from S. Elledge. RNR3 induction assays were carried out essentially as described (22Zhou Z. Elledge S. Genetics. 1992; 131: 851-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RFC deletion strains, complemented by wild type or mutant RFC genes on TRP1 plasmids plus plasmid pZZ2, were treated with 0.01% MMS for 5 h at 30 °C. All assays were done in triplicate and were repeated three to five times. The mutant strains and isogenic wild type controls were grown in YPD medium at 30 °C to OD660 = 2. In some experiments 100 mm hydroxyurea was added to the cultures at an OD660 = 0.5, and growth continued at 30 °C until OD660 = 2 (6–9 h). Protein extracts were made from 4-ml cultures essentially as described and were generally at 1 mg/ml (23Foiani M. Marini F. Gamba D. Lucchini G. Plevani P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were fractionated on 10% acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with immunopurified Rfc antibodies as detailed in the legends to the figures. Detection was with either with an ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by staining with the BCIP/NBT FAST substrate from Sigma. To measure phosphorylation of Rad53p, early log phase cells were arrested with 10 μg/ml α-factor (Sigma) for 2 h. Twenty minutes after release from α-factor, MMS was added to 0.1% final concentration, and time points were taken. Extracts were fractionated on 7.5% acrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with an anti-Rad53 antibody (yC-19) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Detection was with an ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Site-directed mutations were created in the ATP-binding motifs of theRFC1, RFC2, RFC3, and RFC4genes. The Rfc5 subunit lacks critical residues in both the Walker A and B motifs of the ATP-binding domain and was therefore not subjected to mutagenesis (Fig. 1 A). As with the δ′ subunit of the E. coli γ-complex, the ATP-binding domain in Rfc5p likely is of structural importance rather than of importance in binding ATP (5Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1997; 91: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The conserved lysine in the Walker A motif was mutated to either an arginine or glutamic acid residue (Fig. 1 A). Arginine was chosen because in some instances a Lys → Arg mutation still permits ATP binding, although in general the protein is biologically inactive (24Hishida T. Iwasaki H. Yagi T. Shinagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25335-25342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Thiagalingam S. Grossman L. J. Biol.

The reversal of charge in the Lys → Glu mutants was expected to virtually abolish ATP binding and ATPase activity. Our biochemical analysis also showed a more severe phenotype for the Lys → Glu mutations than for the analogous Lys → Arg mutations (6Gary Schmidt S.L. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34784-34791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B outlines the abbreviations used for the mutant strains throughout this paper. A chromosomal deletion of each particular RFC was created as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because allRFC genes are essential, the chromosomal deletion was complemented by the wild type RFC gene on a centromere plasmid containing also the URA3 gene as a selectable marker. These plasmids, as well as the ones described below, contained the wild type or mutant RFC gene positioned behind its natural promoter to ensure appropriate expression. A test of the different wild type strains showed that they were similar to the parental strain (W303) in growth and response to DNA-damaging agents (data not shown). The appropriate strain with the wild typeRFC gene on a URA3 plasmid was transformed with a second centromere plasmid with either TRP1, HIS3, or LEU2 as a selectable marker and carrying either the wild type RFC gene or the Lys → Arg or Lys → Glu mutant gene, and cells containing both plasmids were plated on 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing medium at 13, 23, or 30 °C. The cells that were able to grow on this medium had lost the URA3 plasmid containing the wild type gene and were therefore able to grow with theRFC mutant gene. Colonies were replated on YPD plates, again at various temperatures, and growth was determined. TableIII shows the results of these experiments, and Fig. 2 shows growth defects in the mutants at 13 °C.Table IIIGrowth and repair defects of the mutantsMutant13 °C30 °CHydroxyureaMMSUVWild type+++++++++++++++rfc1R+++++++++++++++rfc1E++±++±++±++±++±rfc2R++−−++rfc2Elethalrfc3R+++++++++/−++±++±rfc3Elethalrfc4R++++−++++rfc4E+++++++++++++++rfc1R/2R+/−+−−++rfc1R/3R++++++++++++rfc1R/4Rlethalrfc1R/4E+/−+++++++rfc1E/2Rlethalrfc1E/3Rlethalrfc1E/4Rlethalrfc1E/4Elethalrfc2R/3Rlethalrfc2R/4Rlethalrfc2R/4E−+−−+rfc3R/4Elethalrfc3R/4RlethalFor growth at 13 or 30 °C, 105, 104, 103, and 102 cells were spotted as 10-μl drops on YPD plates and growth was scored after 6–8 or 2–3 days, respectively.

For each RFC gene, when the lysine was replaced by an arginine, cell growth occurred. In fact, except for therfc2R mutant, no growth defects were observed in the mutants at 30 °C. The rfc2R mutant strain grew very poorly on synthetic selection medium, but adequate growth was observed when the mutant was propagated on rich medium. In rich medium therfc2R mutant had a plating efficiency of ∼30% and a doubling time 1.6 times greater than wild type at 30 °C. An analysis by fluorescence microscopy of the mutant showed an accumulation of large budded cells. In ∼60% of these arrested cells the nucleus was positioned at the neck of the bud, consistent with an arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle because of replication defects (data not shown). However, 40% of the cells did complete nuclear division. The low plating efficiency of the mutant and the incomplete cell cycle arrest are suggestive of a checkpoint defect in therfc2R strain, in addition to the replication defect (see below). The rfc4R strain showed some cold sensitivity for growth. When glutamic acid was substituted for lysine in RFC2 andRFC3 lethality resulted. In contrast, the rfc1Emutant had only a slight growth defect, and the rfc4E mutant had no detectable defects (Fig. 2 and Table III). An observed phenotypic defect in a particular RFC mutant may not necessarily be due to the inability of the mutant subunit to bind and/or hydrolyze ATP. For instance, defects could also result if the mutant subunit were unstable, not properly folded, failed to assemble into an appropriate RFC complex with the other Rfc subunits, or failed to interact with other proteins in the pathway, e.g. PCNA. Our E. coli expression studies of mutant RFCs have shown that all complexes containing a single subunit with a Lys → Glu mutation assembled into isolatable complexes (6Gary Schmidt S.L. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 34784-34791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, if a mutant subunit showed a profound instability in yeast, this could result in the observation of a phenotypic defect that is unrelated to the ATP binding properties of the mutant subunit. Conversely, overexpression of a mutant subunit could conceivably suppress its phenotypic defect. The levels of the mutant subunits were determined by Western analysis. Both the mutant Rfc1R and the Rfc1E subunit were present at levels comparable with the wild type control, i.e. differences in protein levels were less than 2-fold (data not shown). Similarly, the Rfc4R and Rfc4E subunits were present at levels comparable with wild type, and those levels did not change significantly when the strains were grown in the presence of hydroxyurea (Fig.3). Furthermore, the Rfc2R and Rfc3R subunits were also present at levels comparable with those of the respective wild type subunits (data not shown). Expression of the Rfc2E and Rfc3E subunits could not be directly measured because the mutations were lethal. The RFC2, rfc2R, andrfc2E genes were placed under control of the galactose-inducible GAL1-10 promoter cassette. Upon growth on galactose-containing medium, overproduction of Rfc2E was equivalent to that of Rfc2 or Rfc2R, indicating that the stabi"

Among the components of the transcriptional machinery that confer regulatory specificity are sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors. These often come in families, the members of which have identical or overlapping DNA binding specificities but differ in transcriptional activities depending on the particular gene or cellular context. In some cases, the differences in transcriptional activities among family members have been shown to be due to interaction with other DNA-binding transcription factors (1Curran T. Vogt P.

The Jun family of cellular transcription factors consists of three members (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), that are involved in responses of cells to extracellular signaling agents, including growth factors and cytokines (6Ryder K.

The Jun proteins show nearly identical amino acid sequences in their dimerizing/DNA-binding bZip domains and less similarity elsewhere (14Ryder K. Lanahan A. Perez-Albuerne E. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The various Jun or Jun/Fos dimers preferentially bind in vitro to identical or nearly identical DNA sequences (15Nakabeppu Y. Ryder K. Nathans D.

Hence, differential transcriptional activities of the dimers may be due largely to specific interactions with other proteins. A number of such regulatory interactions of Jun proteins have been described, including interactions with other DNA-binding transcription factors (17Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H. Park K.-K. Cato A. Gebel S.

Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). Some of these interactions are specific for a particular Jun protein. Homeodomain proteins form a large family of sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors involved in the regulation of diverse genetic programs, including those that underlie embryonic development of animals and plants (31Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 32Weigel D. Meyerowitz E. Cell. 1994; 78: 203-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The homeodomain, or homeobox, responsible for DNA binding is the structural element common to the family. It consists of three helices separated by short loops and preceded by a flexible arm (33Qian Y. Billeter M. Otting G. Muller M. Gerhing W. Wuthrich K.

Cell. 1990; 63: 579-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Helix III (the C-terminal helix) contacts DNA bases in the major groove, and the flexible arm contacts bases in the minor groove (34Kissinger C. Liu B. Martin-Blanco E. Kornberg T. Pabo C. Cell. 1990; 63: 579-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 35Gehring W. Qian Y. Billeter M. Furokubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A. Resendez-Perez D. Affolter M. Otting G. Wuthrich K.

DNA binding sites of homeodomain proteins are A/T-rich, but the proteins differ in affinity for specific A/T-rich sequences (reviewed in Refs. 35Gehring W. Qian Y. Billeter M. Furokubo-Tokunaga K.

Cooperative binding of homeodomain proteins to multiple DNA binding sites is thought to confer additional specificity in the regulation of target genes (38Beachy P. Varkey J. Young K. von Kessler D. Sun B. Ekker S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6941-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The expression of certain genes appears to require the expression of both homeodomain and AP-1 family members. In one study, the coordinate expression of HoxB7 and bFGF in numerous melanoma cell lines led to the demonstration that this angiogenic factor is transcriptionally regulated by HoxB7 (39Care A. Silvani A. Meccia E. Mattia G. Stoppaciaro A. Parmiani G. Pesch Colombo M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of the bFGF promoter demonstrated the absolute requirement for a single homeodomain-binding site in the promoter for the activation by HoxB7. In addition, the constitutive expression of HoxB7 protein has consistently been found associated with glioma, leukemias, and carcinomas, reinforcing a connection between dysregulated HoxB7 and neoplasia. Other studies have implicated the importance of AP-1-responsive elements present in the bFGF promoter for its activation in response to cell density (40Moffett J. Kratz E. Florkiewicz R. Stachowiak M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2770-2775Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and heat (41Erdos G. Lee Y.J. Cho J.M. Corry P.M. J. Cell Physiol. 1995; 164: 404-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), highly suggestive of a role of Jun/Fos family proteins in its regulation. Here we describe a novel interaction between the Jun and homeodomain families of transcription factors, discovered by means of the yeast two-hybrid system (42Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Unlike most of the known interactions between Jun proteins and other sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, the N-terminal region of Jun proteins is involved in this interaction, and it is the homeodomain of these transcription factors that is responsible for the interaction. Using the initial homeodomain protein Hex detected in the two-hybrid screen, we show that the interaction between Hex homeodomain and Jun is correlated with inhibition of Jun-dependent transcription by Hex in transient transfection assays. Since Jun proteins have been implicated in the responses of cells to growth and differentiation factors and homeodomain proteins are extensively involved in developmental and differentiation programs, our results raise the possibility that the functional interaction between Jun proteins and homeodomain-containing transcription factors may play a role in affecting the balance between normal cell proliferation, differentiation during development, and neoplastic transformation. DNA encoding the N-terminal segments of c-Jun (aa 1–104) and JunB (aa 1–128) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and ligated toSalI-linearized pPC62 (43Chevray P. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). DNA encoding the N-terminal segment of JunD was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted directionally into the EcoRI and SpeI sites of pPC97 (43Chevray P. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The fusion gene between the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DB) and the N-terminal 104 aa of c-Jun (DB:cl-104) was inserted into the unique HpaI site of the 5.3-kilobase (kb) genomic fragment of the Leu gene. The 0.65-kbSalI-BglII fragment of clone 3 encoding Hex was cloned into pPC86 (43Chevray P. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Deletions of the C-terminal end of this isolate were made using the Erase-a-Base system (Promega). A cDNA encoding the entire coding region of clone 3 was isolated from an 8.5-day embryonic cDNA library using a 0.3-kb fragment as a probe. A DNA fragment from clone 3 encoding the putative homeodomain (aa 131–203), was inserted between the EcoRI-SpeI sites of plasmid pPC86 (43Chevray P. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A construct encoding the homeodomain ofDrosophila Ubx and 24 C-terminal amino acids in plasmid pPC86 was kindly provided by Donald Jackson. Chimeric Hex/En genes were generated by introducing (48Jones D. Winistorfer S. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 528-534PubMed Google Scholar) either a silentRsaI restriction site (between helices I and II) orMseI site (between helices II and III) in Hex or En-1 homeodomain constructs in pBluescriptKS− (Stratagene). The appropriate fragments were combined, and the resulting constructs were sequenced prior to transfer of the hybrid homeodomains to plasmid pPC86. Expression constructs encoding Hex (XbaI-EcoRV) or En-1 (HindIII-MscI) cDNAs were cloned into vector pcDEBΔ-neo at the appropriate sites. A plasmid containing the murine engrailed cDNA was kindly provided by Alexandra Joyner. Hex (M-2), containing an N52Q substitution was made by recombination polymerase chain reaction (48Jones D. Winistorfer S. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 528-534PubMed Google Scholar) of a plasmid containing the Hex-coding region; the resulting plasmid was sequenced to assure the presence of the desired mutation. A 0.25-kb MscI-BglII fragment containing the mutation was used to reconstruct a full-length Hex gene. As above, a Hex (M-2) expression construct was generated by inserting the XbaI-EcoRV Hex (M-2) fragment into pcDEBΔ-neo. Annealed oligonucleotides containing six tandem copies of the Prh (49Crompton M. Bartleet T. MacGregor A. Manfioletti G. Buratti E. Giancotti V. Goodwin G.

Bauman I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). GST/homeodomain fusion constructs were prepared by transferring the appropriateSmaI/SpeI (blunt) homeodomain segment from pPC86 constructs described above to the unique SmaI site of pGEX-3T. The bFGF(1.3)CAT plasmid was made by transferring a 1.3-kbHindIII-XhoI fragment into pBLCAT20. G5E1bCAT and the GAL4(DB)-VP16(AD) expression plasmid were obtained from Mark Worthington. G5E1b(HBS6)CAT was made by transferring aHindIII fragment containing six tandem Hex binding sites (HBS) into similarly cut G5E1bCAT. Expression plasmids encoding members of the Jun and Fos family (pcDEBΔ:neo:c-Jun, pcDEBΔ:c-Fos, pcDEBΔ:JunB, pcDEBΔ:JunD, pYN3214-lacZ) were provided by Yusaku Nakabeppu. A DNA fragment encoding theSaccharomyces cerevisiae LEU gene containing GAL4 DB:c-Jun-(1–104) fusion was integrated at theLEU locus of yeast strain PCY2 (43Chevray P. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The colonies were transferred to supported nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell), permeabilized by brief immersion in liquid nitrogen and incubated on 3MM paper saturated with Z-buffer (52Miller H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) containing 1 mg/ml X-GAL at 37 °C. F9 teratocarcinoma cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104/10-cm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. The following day, the cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (53van der Eb A. Graham F. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The input amount of DNA per transfection was standardized using expression vectors containing no cDNA inserts. The cells were washed two times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum 20 h post-transfection. Approximately 44 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested, and CAT assays were performed as previously described (54Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Plasmid pYN3214-lacZ (4 μg) was included as a measure of transfection efficiency; CAT values were normalized to β-galactosidase activity. In vitrotranslated proteins were made with reagents from Promega using their protocols. The proteins were incubated in binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.12 ng of 32P-labeled AP-1 oligonucleotide (sc-2501; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the complexes were separated on 5% native polyacrylamide gels. They were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gels. Equivalent amounts of whole cell lysates from cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids were separated on SDS-gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were then blotted with antibodies specific to Hex or Ubx. The Ubx antibody was kindly provided by Rob White (Cambridge, UK). The Hex antibody was raised to a segment of the Hex protein C-terminal to the homeodomain as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Following the incubation with the primary antibodies, the membranes were then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed using standard enhanced chemiluminescent chemistry. Fusion proteins were produced by induction of logarithmically growing cultures with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1–2 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to the supernatant and gently rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with 50 ml of PBS (plus phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin), and the bound fusion proteins eluted from the beads with the addition of 50 mm glutathione, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Excess glutathione was removed either by dialysis versus PBS or centrifugation over spin columns (Costar) followed by extensive washing with PBS. Binding assays were performed as follows. Molar equivalents (1–3 μg) of fusion protein were added to 1 ml of binding buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), l00 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Molar equivalent amounts of35S-labeled Jun in vitro translation products (with or without c-Fos) were then added, followed by 100 μl of a slurry of 1:1 glutathione-Sepharose beads in PBS. The mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After three washes with 0.75 ml of binding buffer, the beads were taken up in 50 μl of 1× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer, and proteins were electrophoresed in 12.5% SDS gels, fixed, enhanced by flourography, dried, and exposed to film. As part of our continued effort to identify proteins that differentially regulate the activities of Jun transcription factors, we screened an embryonic murine cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system (42Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar, 43Chevray P. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) for clones that encode proteins that interact preferentially with an N-terminal segment of c-Jun versus the analogous segments of JunB and JunD (14Ryder K. Lanahan A. Perez-Albuerne E. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). We began with the N-terminal segment of c-Jun for the following reasons: the Jun proteins show differences in their N-terminal regions (14Ryder K. Lanahan A. Perez-Albuerne E. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar); it had been reported that an inhibitor of c-Jun activity interacts with this region of c-Jun (27Baichwal V. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); and deletion of the N terminus of c-Jun enhances its transforming activity (55Bos F. Monteclaro F. Mitsunobu S. Ball A.J. CHW C. Nishimura T. Vogt P. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1677-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For our purpose, a DNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–104 of c-Jun was joined to DNA encoding the DNA binding of GAL4 (amino acids 1–147) in plasmid pPC62 (43Chevray P. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). A yeast strain PCY2 (GAL4 DB-Jun) with this hybrid gene integrated at the LEU2 locus was constructed by homologous recombination. The resulting strain, which containslacZ under the control of the gal-1regulatory sequence, was used to screen the GAL4 activation domain (AD)-cDNA fusion library (43Chevray P. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) for plasmids that produce β-galactosidase positive colonies. From 3 × l06 transformants, several positive colonies were detected. Nucleotide sequencing of the rescued plasmids indicated that there were three distinct cDNAs. One isolate (clone 3) was found to encode a predicted homeodomain-containing polypeptide. It showed weak interaction with JunB-(1–128) or JunD-(1–131) in the two-hybrid system. The DNA insert of clone 3 was used to isolate a 1.8-kb cDNA from a mouse embryo library (Stratagene). It encoded a homeodomain protein of 271 amino acids identical to a cDNA encoding Hex. Hex was originally isolated from a mouse hematopoietic tissue library (56Bedford F. Ashworth A., T Wiedemann L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1245-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and is homologous to the chicken protein Prh identified by cDNA cloning from BM2 cells (49Crompton M. Bartleet T. MacGregor A. Manfioletti G. Buratti E. Giancotti V. Goodwin G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5661-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding the human homolog of Prh (PRH) has also been isolated from promyelocytic cells (57Hromas R. Radich J. Collins S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 976-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and, more recently, rat (58Tanaka M. Hara T. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Miyajima A. Blood. 1999; 93: 804-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hex mRNA was found in mouse spleen, liver, bone marrow, and peripheral blood cells and in a variety of mouse and human cell lines derived from hematopoietic tissue (49Crompton M. Bartleet T. MacGregor A. Manfioletti G. Buratti E. Giancotti V. Goodwin G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5661-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,56Bedford F. Ashworth A., T Wiedemann L.

To determine what part of Hex interacts with c-Jun-(1–104), a series of truncated Hex cDNA-GAL4(AD) fusion constructs was tested in strain PCY2 (GAL4 DB-Jun-(1–104)) with the β-galactosidase filter assay (Fig. 1). A construct that lacked the N-terminal 32 amino acids of Hex retained the ability to interact with c-Jun and was used as a starting point for additional C-terminal truncations. Deletion into the predicted homeodomain of Hex led to loss of interaction with c-Jun. A construct that retained only the 61-amino acid Hex homeodomain and several flanking residues (amino acids 131–203) was capable of interacting with the c-Jun N-terminal segment, giving a signal comparable with that of the initial Hex isolate (Fig.1). Thus, the Hex homeodomain appears sufficient for interaction with c-Jun. Since the homeodomain is a common transcription factor motif (59Levine M. Hoey T. Cell. 1988; 55: 537-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether the c-Jun/Hex interaction was specific for Hex or a more general property of homeodomain proteins. The homeodomains from four additional proteins were tested for their ability to interact with c-Jun-(1–104) (TableI). The homeodomains from murine Hoxc-8 (11Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 243-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), interacted with c-Jun, giving signals comparable with that of Hex. However, the homeodomain from murine engrailed (En-1) (47Joyner A. Martin G. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) interacted weakly with c-Jun-(1–104), giving a signal only slightly above background. We conclude that homeodomains from a number of proteins can interact with c-Jun-(1–104), suggesting that many additional homeodomain proteins"

We report herewith the molecular characterization of a T. cruzi DnaJ gene, termed TcJ6, encoding a protein that displays high sequence homology with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sis1 co-chaperone required for the initiation of translation. TcJ6 protein was expressed as a polypeptide of 36.5 kDa at a constant level during parasite differentiation and was associated to the cytoplasmic fraction. We showed that overexpression of TcJ6 complemented a temperature-sensitive yeast sis1 mutant. In addition, sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis of polysomes from T. cruzi and a yeast mutant overexpressing TcJ6p showed that the trypanosomal co-chaperone was closely associated with ribosomal subunits, 80 S monosomes and the smaller polysomes, as observed for Sis1p. Furthermore, in T. cruzi TcJ6p was also found to be preferentially concentrated around the nucleus, giving a speckled staining pattern. This suggests that TcJ6p is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. Taken together, these data suggest that the trypanosomal DnaJ is involved in initiation of translation.

Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). DnaJ stimulates the weak intrinsic ATPase activity of DnaK (2Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) and can also directly interact with specific substrates of the chaperone machinery (3Wickner S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2690-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Various DnaJ homologs have been discovered in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic DnaJ-like proteins belong to the conserved heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40)1 family and are involved in regulation of the Hsp70 molecular chaperones (DnaK-like proteins), mediating the biogenesis of proteins. Some Hsp40s may be considered to be true molecular chaperones in that they prevent aggregation by binding directly to unfolded polypeptide substrates (4Craig E. Yan W. James P. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysis: Regulation, Cellular Function, and Mechanisms. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, the Netherlands1999: 139-162Google Scholar, 5Krobitsch S. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). All DnaJ-like proteins contain a J domain of about 70 amino acids, generally N-terminal, which represents the signature of the family (6Bukau B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and is required for interaction with the ATPase domain of Hsp70 (7Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The basic mechanism of action of the Hsp70 proteins is sequential binding and release in an ATP-dependent manner of polypeptides in non-native conformations (protein folding). The subcellular compartmentalization of different Hsp70 members and their specific interactions with various DnaJ-like proteins allows these chaperones to be involved in a variety of protein biogenesis pathways including the assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, proteolysis, the translocation of proteins into organelles and translation initiation (reviewed in Ref. 8Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome data base (genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces) contains 20 putative Hsp40s homologous to E. coli DnaJ, but only half have been characterized and localized to major cellular compartments (4Craig E. Yan W. James P. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysis: Regulation, Cellular Function, and Mechanisms. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, the Netherlands1999: 139-162Google Scholar, 8Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem.

The Hsp40 family has been divided into three distinct subgroups based on the presence of conserved functional domains in addition to the J domain (7Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 9Yan W. Craig E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7751-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Class I Hsp40s have a glycine-phenylalanine-rich (G-F) region followed by a cysteine-rich region (CRR domain), which forms a zinc finger motif with four repeats of a C XXC XG XG motif and a weakly conserved C-terminal domain. The archetypal E. coli DnaJ and the S. cerevisiae Ydj1 protein are class I Hsp40s. Class II Hsp40s include the S. cerevisiae Sis1 protein and its mammalian homolog, the co-chaperone Hdj1, and lack the CRR domain. Finally, in class III Hsp40s, only the conserved J domain is present. The J domain is thought to be involved in interactions with Hsp70s via its HPD tripeptide loop (10Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 11Pellecchia M. Szyperski T. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), whereas the G-F region is a critical determinant required for the specificity of S. cerevisiaeSis1p (9Yan W. Craig E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7751-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In class I Hsp40 proteins, the zinc finger motif and the poorly conserved C-terminal domain have been shown to act as binding sites for proteins in denatured state (12Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 13Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the J domain and G-F region may be sufficient for the basic functions of class I and class II Hsp40s in vivo, whereas the distal C-terminal regions are important in yeast in suboptimal growth conditions (9Yan W. Craig E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7751-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The unicellular protozoan, Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, has a complex life cycle where the parasite passes through three differentiation forms and two hosts, a reduviid insect vector (triatomine) and a mammalian host (14Brener Z. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1973; 27: 347-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). During this cycle, the parasite encounters drastic environmental changes (e.g. in temperature and pH), and these changes are accompanied by major morphological changes. The epimastigotes (insect forms) replicate in the insect host midgut and differentiate to produce metacyclic trypomastigotes (by a process known as metacyclogenesis). These metacyclic trypomastigotes are non-proliferative and infectious forms released in the excreta of the bug. Although the insect feeds on the blood of the mammalian host, metacyclic trypomastigotes invade the bloodstream of the host and infect various cell types (mainly macrophages and muscle cells) in which the trypomastigotes differentiate to produce amastigotes (proliferative forms). Metacyclogenesis can be simulated in vitro using a chemically defined differentiation medium (15Contreras V.T. Salles J.M. Thomas N. Morel C.M. Goldenberg S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In T. cruzi, 5 members of the DnaJ-like family (TcDnaJ) have been partially characterized (16Tibbetts R.S. Jensen J.L. Olson C.L. Wang F.D. Engman D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 17Carreira M.A.C. Tibbetts R.S. Olson C.L. Schuster C. Renz M. Engman D.M. Goldenberg S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 166: 141-146PubMed Google Scholar) and shown to have a highly conserved N-terminal J domain. The proteins tcj2, tcj3, and tcj4 belong to Hsp40s class I, whereas tcj1 and TcDJ1 belong to class III. Except for the putative mitochondrial DnaJ-like protein, TcDJ1, the function and subcellular location of the other family members are still unknown. A highly conserved gene encoding a novel TcDnaJ was recently sequenced in five species of trypanosomatids (Trypanosoma b. brucei,Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma vivax, T. cruzi, and Leishmania donovani) in a downstream region flanking the glucose transporter gene cluster (18Bringaud F. Vedrenne C. Cuvillier A. Parzy D. Baltz D. Tetaud E. Pays E. Venegas J. Merlin G. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In T. cruzi, glucose transporters (TcrHT1) are encoded by a multigene family that is organized into several clusters, all contained within a genomic fragment no larger than 150 kb (18Bringaud F. Vedrenne C. Cuvillier A. Parzy D. Baltz D. Tetaud E. Pays E. Venegas J. Merlin G. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Tetaud E. Bringaud F. Chabas S. Barrett M.P. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8278-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the T. cruzi CL strain, two clusters of TcrHT1 genes, separated by several dozen of kilobases, flank several duplicates of a 20-kb region composed of genes encoding an adenylate cyclase homologous to the T. b. brucei pESAG4 (20Paindavoine P. Rolin S. Van Assel S. Geuskens M. Jauniaux J.C. Dinsart C. Huet G. Pays E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), a DnaJ protein homologous to human DNAJ1, and two small G-proteins homologous to human Rab1 and yeast YPT7, which belong to the Rab family. This kind of repetition in tandem of large stretches of DNA is characteristic of intrachromosomal amplifications, which are frequently observed in T. cruzi. Run-on experiments showed that in T. b. brucei the battery of genes flanking the THT (trypanosome hexose transporter) gene cluster are transcribed by an RNA polymerase II on a distance of at least 50 kb, suggesting that these genes belong to the same transcription unit (18Bringaud F. Vedrenne C. Cuvillier A. Parzy D. Baltz D. Tetaud E. Pays E. Venegas J. Merlin G. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similar large transcription units have been described in T. brucei that contained various genes grouped in an active expression site where they are co-transcribed by a polymerase I-like RNA polymerase (21Pays E. Broda P.M.A. Oliver S.G. Sims P.F.G. The Eukaryotic Genome: Organization and Regulation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1989: 127-160Google Scholar). This is the case of the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes and a number of co-expressed linked genes, which may be involved in optimization of parasite adaptation to different environmental conditions (22Bitter W. Gerrits H. Kieft R. Borst P. Nature. 1998; 391: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that the parasite contains functional units similar to prokaryotic operons (23Borst P. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 307-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study, we mapped a DNA fragment of 14.3 kb homologous to the downstream region of the glucose transporter gene cluster isolated from a T. cruzi genomic library. This gene unit differs from the repeat region of 20 kb previously described in the TcrHT1 locus by the presence of a pseudogene of the large trans-sialidase multigene family (reviewed in Ref. 24Schenkman S. Eichinger D. Pereira M.E.A. Nussenzweig V. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 499-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To determine if these genes form a functional unit similar to the VSG polycistronic unit in T. bruceibloodstream forms, we decided to investigate the function of the novel TcDnaJ-encoded protein, termed TcJ6p, on the differentiation process in T. cruzi. Surprisingly, the trypanosomal co-chaperone displayed a high level of similarity to various eukaryotic class II Hsp40s (Caenorhabditis elegans protein homologous DnaJ, human DNAJ1 protein, Sis1p), whereas only 21–40% of sequence conservation was found with the other five members of the T. cruzi DnaJ-like family. The yeast Sis1p is the only class II Hsp40 protein that has been functionally characterized. This protein is required for the initiation of translation in S. cerevisiae(25Zhong T. Arndt K.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1175-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the Sis1 and TcJ6 proteins might have similar functions. In this study, we used heterologous functional complementation and polysome sucrose gradient sedimentation to demonstrate that TcJ6p has a function similar to that of the Sis1 co-chaperone, which is essential for translation initiation in yeast.

Complementation of Sis1 function by TcJ6 protein was carried out on the control strain CY736 expressing wild type Sis1p and on the temperature-sensitive strain CY732, carrying a sis1-85 allele. The genotypes of the strains are CY736 (MATa , ura3-1, leu2-3, 112, his3-11, 15, trp1-1 ade 2-1 ssd1-d2 can1-100Δsis1::HIS3 (SIS1 on LEU2/CEN plasmid)) and CY732 (MATa , ura3-1, leu2-3, 112, his3-11, 15, trp1-1 ade2-1 ssd1-d2 can1-100Δsis1::HIS3(NH2-hemagglutinin-tagged sis1-85 on LEU2/CEN plasmid)). These strains were kindly donated by Dr. Kim T. Arndt (31Luke M.M. Sutton A. Arndt K.T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Rich media contained 1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose or 2% galactose. Synthetic media contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, or 2% galactose and the supplements to satisfy auxotrophic requirements. A densely arrayed T. cruzi Dm28c λEMBL3 Sau3A genomic library (29Fragoso S.P. Goldenberg S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 55: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was screened at high stringency with a probe corresponding to the 5′ conserved region of a gene related to the sialidase family. The cDNA probe was obtained by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A reverse oligonucleotide, 5′-CCCTAAAGCAATTCTCTCAGC-3′, corresponding to the 5′-conserved region of a sialidase-like gene was used as a primer using the Superscript II enzyme (Life Technologies, Inc.) as indicated by the manufacturer, on total RNA from the parasites pretreated by RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega). The first-strand cDNA was subsequently amplified by PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies) using a forward mini-exon oligonucleotide BamHI (5′-GCGGCGGATCCACAGTTTCTGTACTATATTG-3′ (BamHI site is underlined) and the reverse oligonucleotide with the following cycle parameters: 94 °C, 30 s; 52 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min for 3 cycles and 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min for 30 cycles. The purified PCR product was cloned and sequenced (GenBankTM data base accession number AY017371). All PCR reactions were performed on a PerkinElmer DNA Thermal Cycler (GenAmp PCR System 9600), and PCR products were separated in an agarose gel, purified on glass beads (Gene-clean, Bio 101) or directly purified on QIAquick column (Qiagen, Inc.), and subcloned into PCR2.1 or pCR-Blunt vectors (Invitrogen). Sequencing was performed manually using the Thermosequenase sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with [α-33P]ddNTPs (1500 Ci/mmol) as terminators, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences were determined by sequencing on both strands of DNA. From 200,000 recombinant phages hybridized with the cDNA probe, 14 phages were isolated after three consecutive screenings. Analysis of DNA inserts of each phage were characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and by Southern blot hybridization with the same probe. Two types of recombinants were found based on SalI digestion pattern, and two of them, designed, respectively, cl263g (14.3 kb) and cl381 g (19.8 kb) were chosen for hybridization analysis. Positive bands of different sizes were subcloned from phages cl263g and cl381g in bacteriophage M13 (mp18 and mp19) or in plasmid pBlueScript S/K+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to be sequenced. The GenBankTM data base accession number of a 4.3-kb SalI cl263g genomic subclone containing the sialidase pseudogene, TcJ6, and 5′-coding region of Rab1 homolog is AF345336. The relative position of DNA fragments within phage subclone 4.3-kb cl263 genomic DNA was confirmed by sequencing extremities of each cloned fragment by PCR. The complete genetic map of cl263g and the relative positions of adenylate cyclase and small G-protein YPT7 homolog genes were determined with probes derived from the corresponding genes contained in the CosTcr1 cosmid of the CL strain, kindly donated by Dr. F. Bringaud and T. Baltz (18Bringaud F. Vedrenne C. Cuvillier A. Parzy D. Baltz D. Tetaud E. Pays E. Venegas J. Merlin G. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The exact position of these open reading frames (ORFs) was confirmed by sequencing the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the 4.3-kb SalI fragment of cl263g. The 3′ splice site of TcJ6 transcript was determined by RT-PCR using the forward mini-exon oligonucleotide BamHI and a reverse oligonucleotide specific to the 5′-end of TcJ6 gene, 5′-CGGGATGATACTTCAAAGGC-3′. The poly(A) addition site of TcJ6 transcript was determined by RT-PCR using a forward oligonucleotide specific to the 3′-end of TcJ6 gene, 5′-GCCTGCGTCTCTGAACGATGC-3′, with a reverse oligo-dT oligonucleotide BamHI, 5′-GCGGCGGATCC(T)18-3′ (the BamHI site is underlined). The cycle conditions of both RT-PCRs were identical as described above. The procedures employed for Southern and Northern blot hybridizations are described elsewhere (30Pays E. Delronche M.

Nucleic acids were blotted onto Hybond-N or Hybond-C Extra membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and fixed following the manufacturer's instructions. Probes were labeled by nick translation (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or random priming (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified through a Sephadex G-50 column. A small subunit ribosomal RNA probe used as a loading control in Southern analysis was obtained using the forward oligonucleotide, 5′-CGAACAACTGCCCTATCAGCC-3′, and the reverse oligonucleotide, 5′-CCTCATCTTTTTTTTTTGACATTGG-3′, as primers for RT-PCR on 5 μg of T. cruzi total RNA (33Fernandes A.P. Nelson K. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11608-11612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The conditions for RT-PCR reaction were identical, as described above but using the following cycle parameters: 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min for 30 cycles. The purified PCR fragment of 168 base pairs was cloned and sequenced. The α-tubulin probe was obtained from an incomplete cDNA of 1.3 kb sub-cloned in M13, kindly provided by Dr. Mônica Carreira (Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Departamento de Bioquı́mica e Biologia Molecular). Sequence analysis was performed using the GCG/Wisconsin software (34Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar). Chromosome separation (2 × 107 parasites/slot) was performed using the Pulsaphor system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 1.2% agarose gels in 0.5× Tris-borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer. The running conditions were as follows: pulses of 90 s at 50 V for 1 h followed by pulses of 90 s at 100 V for 1 h and at 150 V with a pulse time of 90 s ramped to 150 s at 4 °C for 50 h. To obtain a truncated form of TcJ6 E. colirecombinant protein (TcJ6ΔJp), a BamHI site was created downstream of the N-terminal J domain to insert the TcJ6 ORF lacking the first 74 amino acids into the E. coli expression vector PQE8 (Qiagen, Inc.). The truncated ORF was amplified by PCR using a Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) on a genomic template using the forward oligonucleotide, 5′-AGGGATCCAAGGGCGGCGTTCCCG-3′ (where the BamHI site, underlined, corresponds to position 217 of TcJ6 gene), and the reverse oligonucleotide, 5′-GTAGATCAAAGCTTGTTTTAACAACTAAAACTGG-3′, where the HindIII site was created immediately upstream of stop codon (the HindIII site and the stop codon are underlined). After PCR amplification and treatment by a Taq polymerase to add 3′ A-overhangs, the PCR fragment of 827 base pairs was subcloned into PCR2.1. The BamHI/HindIII fragment was subcloned into BamHI/HindIII-digested pQE8. The fusion construct was sequenced using flanking vector sequences as primers to ensure that the sequence derived from TcJ6 gene was in the correct orientation and in-frame with the 6×His tag. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced in E. colistrain M15, and cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fusion product was purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Inc.). Polyclonal anti-TcJ6ΔJp antibodies were raised in rabbits immunized three times at 4-week intervals with 150 μg of pure recombinant protein. Antibody depletion on yeast lysate was performed by serial incubations with yeast acetone powder. The IgGs were purified on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used for indirect immunofluorescence. Yeast protein extracts were prepared as previously described (35Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1994: 149-150Google Scholar). Total protein extracts of different stages of T. cruzi were prepared by washing the cells twice with PBS and resuspending them in 1× Laemmli buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) to a final concentration of 1 × 107 cells/μl. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and blotted onto Hybond-C Extra membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following standard procedures. Cytosolic extracts of T. cruzi were prepared as described (37Brecht M. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with anti-TcJ6ΔJp polyclonal antibody (1/10,000 dilution) and a secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (1/7,500 dilution; Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Two different plasmids containing the GAL1-inducible promoter were used. A centromeric plasmid pRN93, termed YCP for yeast centromeric plasmid, a gift from C. W. Slayman from Yale University and a high-copy vector pYES2, termed YEP for yeast episomal plasmid, from Invitrogen. Complete TcJ6 ORF was amplified by PCR on genomic template using a forward primer with a HindIII and BamHI restriction sites immediately upstream of TcJ6 ATG, 5′-GGAAGCTTGGATCCTTGTTGAAAACATGGG-3′ (the HindIII and BamHI sites and TcJ6 ATG are underlined), and a reverse primer with a SacI restriction site at position +11 of TcJ6 stop codon, 5′-CGAGCTCGTTTTAACAACTAAAACTGG-3′ (SacI site and stop codon are underlined). 1-kb HindIII/SacI and BamHI/SacI DNA fragments were subcloned, respectively, into HindIII/SacI-digested pYES2 and BamHI/SacI-digested pRN93 vectors. Yeast were transformed with the resulting plasmids by the lithium acetate method (38Gietz R.D. Shiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Total yeast RNA was isolated as described elsewhere (39Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing TcJ6p were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in minimal medium. 15 min before harvesting the cells, cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 60 μg/ml, and the polysome profile was analyzed in a 15–45% sucrose gradient as reported (40Stansfield I. Grant G.M. Akhmaloka Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3469-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 109 cells were incubated for 5 min at 28 °C in liver infusion tryptose medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. After centrifugation, the parasites were chilled and washed twice with ice-cold washing buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 10 units/ml heparin) (41Goldenberg S.

The cells were lysed according to Brecht and Parsons (37Brecht M. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using the buffer system A and the preparation of cytoplasmic extracts was carried out as reported. The polysome profile was analyzed in a linear 15–50% sucrose gradient. After centrifugation, the gradients were harvested from the bottom using a pump system coupled to a fraction collector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a flow rate of 1.1 ml/min and a fraction size of 400 μl. RNA isolation was carried out as reported (37Brecht M. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein fractions were precipitated by 12.5% trichloroacetic acid at −20 °C, and washed twice with acetone, resuspended in Laemmli buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and analyzed after SDS-PAGE by immunoblotting. Parasites were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in PBS. Cells (5 × 107 ml−1) were fixed by the addition of an equal volume of p-formaldehyde in PBS (w/v, 4%) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. After blocking the cells with 3% bovine serum albumin, 5% milk, and methylamine 0.1% in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, the parasites were incubated with 4 μg/ml polyclonal anti-TcJ6ΔJp IgGs in PBS containing 1% milk and 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1/250 dilution, Sigma) and propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) in"

Deletion of box1/2 abrogated all the examined activities of GM-CSF, and this phenomenon is explained by the loss of binding by Jak2. To test if a molecule other than Jak2 interacting with the box1/2 region plays a role in GM-CSF receptor signal transduction, we screened for molecules interacting with the box1/2 region by a pull-down assay using recombinant purified protein of GST fused with the βc box1/2 region and a Ba/F3 cell lysate. The mouse homologue of Mad2 protein, which plays an important role in the M phase of the cell cycle, was revealed to associate with the box1/2 region specifically. Peptides corresponding to the box1 sequence also bound to Mad2, and mutation of the box1 decreased the Mad2 interaction. Deletion analysis indicated that interaction with box1/2 occurred through the C-terminal portion of Mad2. Mad2 is known to change affinity for binding partners cell cycle dependently. Binding affinity of Mad2 to box1/2 increased in the late M phase, suggesting the possibility that GM-CSF participates in regulation of the M phase check point through interaction with Mad2.

Lee F. Miyajima A. Miyatake S. Arai N. Yokota T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 783-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). The receptor of human (h) GM-CSF (GM-CSFR) consists of two subunits, α and β, both of which are members of the cytokine receptor superfamily (2Miyajima A. Mui A.L.-F. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α subunit is specific to hGM-CSFR, whereas the β subunit (βc) is shared by IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-5 receptors (2Miyajima A. Mui A.L.-F. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GM-CSF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of βc and various cellular proteins and activates early response genes such as c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc, as well as stimulates cell proliferation in hematopoietic cells and fibroblasts (3Watanabe S. Mui A.L.-F. Muto A. Chen J.X. Hayashida K. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). GM-CSF activates various signaling molecules, including Jak2, STAT5, mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade kinases, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (2Miyajima A. Mui A.L.-F. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). βc contains box1 and box2 regions (box1/2), which are conserved among the cytokine receptor superfamily, and 8 tyrosine residues located in its cytoplasmic region (4Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 5Murakami M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N. Nakagawa T.

To better comprehend signaling events involved in cell proliferation, we and others analyzed biological activities of various mutants of βc (6Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A.

Blood. 1997; 90: 4759-4760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and found that the box1 region was essential for all of the hGM-CSFR signals we examined. Although the box1/2 region is essential and sufficient for cell proliferation and survival, a tyrosine residue(s) is also required for mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-fos promoter activation (8Okuda K. Griffin J. Blood. 1997; 90: 4759-4760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Itoh T. Liu R. Yokota T. Arai K. Watanabe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 742-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because box1 is assumed to bind Jak2, it is likely that activation of Jak2 is sufficient and essential for hGM-CSF signals through interaction with the box1 region of βc. This notion was supported by observations that dominant negative Jak2 suppressed all the GM-CSFR signaling and activities we investigated (7Watanabe S. Itoh T. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12681-12686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, Jak2 knockout mice showed defects in GM-CSF-dependent colony formation (10Neubauer H.

The box1 region contains the proline-X-proline sequence, which is conserved among members of the cytokine receptor superfamily (12Murakami M. Narazali M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Mutation analysis of the motif suggested a crucial role for the motif in a variety of receptor-mediated signalings. The G-CSF receptor mutant in which the conserved proline-X-proline is substituted by Ala-X-Ala can induce neither DNA synthesis nor cell proliferation (13Avalos B.R. Hunter M.G. Parker J.M. Ceselski S.K. Druker B.J. Corey S.J. Mehta V.B. Blood. 1995; 85: 3117-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant growth hormone receptor failed to induce either cell proliferation or spi-1 induction (14Dinerstein H. Lago F. Goujon L. Ferrag F. Esposito N. Finidori J. Kelly P.A. Postel-Vinay M.C. Mol.

Similar results were obtained in the case of gp130 and the prolactin receptor (12Murakami M. Narazali M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the importance of the box1 region in various receptors has been noted, structural information about this region has been awaited. Thus, the role and mechanism of box1 function have remained unsolved. We have now identified Mad2 (mitotic arrest-deficient 2) protein as a box1/2-binding protein. Mad2 was first discovered as a gene responsible for the mitotic checkpoint in yeast (18Li R. Murray A.W. Cell. 1991; 66: 519-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The knockout of Mad2 in mice showed that Mad2 is essential in mouse cells after embryonic day 6.5, although it is dispensable for normal cell division in yeast (19Dobles M. Liberal V. Scott M.L. Benezra R. Sorger P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 635-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). During mitosis, Mad2 localized at an unattached kinetochore monitors for correct spindle-kinetochore attachment, a prerequisite for initiation of anaphase (20Pennisi E. Science. 1998; 279: 477-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Mad2-dependent monitoring system, maintained until the completion of spindle attachment, prevents anaphase initiation through Mad2-Cdc20 complex formation (21Fang G., Yu, H. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1871-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 22Hwang L.H. Lau L.F. Smith D.L. Mistrot C.A. Hardwick K.G. Hwang E.S. Amon A. Murray A.W.

Cdc20 activates the ubiquitin ligase activity of anaphase promoting complex (APC), after which the activated APC promotes the initiation of anaphase. There are a variety of Mad2 binding partners, including molecules not related to the mitotic checkpoint (24Liu Y.C. Pan J. Zhang C. Fan W. Collinge M. Bender J.R. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Here, we found that hGM-CSFR βc acts as one of such partners of Mad2 and that their interaction is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Recombinant murine IL-3 (mIL-3) expressed in silkworms, Bombyx mori, was purified as described (28Miyajima A. Schreurs J. Otsu K. Kondo A. Arai K. Maeda S. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 58: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recombinant hGM-CSF was a gift from Schering-Plough (Madison, NJ). Antibodies anti-hGM-CSF receptor βc (S-16, C-20) and anti-GST (B-14) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Mad2 was from Transduction Laboratory (Lexington, KY), and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) from Upstate Biotechnology Inc (Lake Placid, NY). Peptides were synthesized by using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry with a Shimadzu PSSM-8 synthesizer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). All the peptides were designed to have a cysteine at their N terminus for iodoacetamido-based sulfhydryl conjugation. Each peptide was conjugated with SulfoLink coupling gel (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Peptide corresponding to CAGGPPGGPQVNPIPVTDEVV served as a control. The plasmids encoding GST fusion protein were constructed by using pGEX vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). GST-box1/2 was constructed by PCR amplification of the box1/2 region corresponding to amino acids 453–544, and termination was generated after residue 544 (aspartic acid) by PCR mutagenesis. Sequences of primers used for introduction of mutation were 5′-ATGTGATCAGGCTGCGCAGAAAGTG-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTAATCTGAGGCAGCTGGAG-3′. Amplified fragments were inserted into BclI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-3X. For GST-α, hGM-CSFR α subunit was digested with CvnI and XhoI. The resulting fragment, which contained almost the entire region of the cytoplasmic region of the α subunit, was inserted into pBS-SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at SmaI (blunted) and XhoI sites. Then, the fragment was isolated by BamHI and XhoI digestion and inserted into BamHI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-5X-1 vector. His-tagged recombinant proteins were constructed by using the QIAexpressionist type IV pQE vector (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) to contain 6 histidines at their N terminus. An XhoI site was created immediately before the initiation codon of Mad2 by PCR mutagenesis, and the entire region of Mad2 was isolated by cleavage at XhoI and HindIII sites. The fragment was inserted into pQE-31 at SalI and HindIII sites. The N terminus deletion mutant was made by insertion of Sau3AI and SacI fragment into pQE-31 BamHI and SacI sites. C terminus deletion was made by deletion of the region after the DpnI site. The DpnI site was blunted and ligated to the blunted SmaI site of the pQE-31 vector. For mammalian expression, the fragment encoding full-length wild-type Mad2 (prepared by XhoI and SpeI sites from pCR2.1 vector; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was inserted into XhoI and SpeI sites of the pKU2 vector, which contains the SRα promoter (29Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding GST fusion proteins were introduced into BL21 cells (Escherichia coli strain), and GST fusion protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm IPTG. The cells were lysed by sonication, and the overexpressed protein was purified on an affinity column packed with glutathione-Sepharose4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instruction. The histidine-tagged proteins were expressed in M15 cells (E. coli strain carrying a pREP4 plasmid), and purification of the protein was done by using an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) affinity column, according to the manufacturer's instruction. The eluents were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and protein concentrations were determined by using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The mouse IL-3-dependent, pro-B cell line Ba/F3 stably expressing both α and β subunits of hGM-CSFR (Ba/F-wild) was maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal calf serum, 0.25 ng/ml mIL-3, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Whole cell lysates used for pull-down assay and immunoprecipitation were prepared by using lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The undissolved fraction of the lysate was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 30 min). Fractionation of HeLa cell lysates into cytoplasm and nucleus portions was done as follows. Briefly, the cells were incubated in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min. Nonidet P-40 was added to the cell suspension at a final concentration of 0.6%. The Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction (enriched in nuclei) was separated by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 30 s). The pellets were washed with hypotonic buffer two times and incubated in extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol) for 20 min. Both Nonidet P-40-soluble and -insoluble fractions were diluted with an excess amount of the lysis buffer used in the pull-down assay. The lysate (108 cells/ml) prepared from Ba/F wild cells was incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST fusion proteins and glutathione Sepharose. GST fusion protein and associated protein(s) were eluted with 15 mm glutathione and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The samples were lyophilized and dissolved in suitable buffer for further analyses. For immunoprecipitation analysis, cell lysates (2 × 107 cells/samples) were incubated with an appropriate antibody and protein G-Sepharose 4 FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at 4 °C. The bands were visualized by using an ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For preparation of cell cycle-synchronized cell lysates, HeLa cells were arrested at the G1/S boundary by a double-thymidine block (30Wassmann K. Benezra R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11193-11198Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were treated for 14 h with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 2 mmthymidine, released for 10 h in normal medium, and then treated again with thymidine for 14 h. There after, the cells were released in normal medium and harvested after incubation for the times indicated in the figures. For Ba/F3 cells, cells were depleted of mIL-3 for 12 h to become arrested in the G1 phase. hGM-CSF (2 ng/ml) was then added, and the cells were harvested at the indicated time points. The phase of the cell cycle was confirmed by examining DNA contents by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The lysates from each time point were prepared as described above. Protein amounts of the lysates were quantified with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) to confirm equal extraction efficiency among the samples. The lysate from each time point was divided into two tubes, and incubated with anti-βc antibody (2 μg, for Ba/F3 cells), GST-box1/2 purified protein (for HeLa cells), or anti-p55CDC antibody (2 μg). Associated proteins were precipitated either with glutathione-Sepharose beads or protein G beads and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-Mad2 antibody. Two-dimensional electrophoresis, a combination of isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE, was carried out according to O'Farrell (31O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein spots were detected either by silver staining or Western blotting. Silver staining of the PAGE gel was done with a 2D Silver Stain II kit (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by using a semidry type apparatus (model BE-320; Bio-Craft Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and the blotted membrane was incubated with appropriate antibodies. For amino acid sequencing, two-dimensional separated gels were stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue and bands of 25 and 75 kDa were excised and treated with 0.2 μg of Achromobacter protease I (a gift from Dr. Masaki, Ibaraki University (Ref. 32Masaki T. Tanabe M. Nakamura K. Soejima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 660: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)) at 37 °C for 12 h in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 0.1% SDS. The peptides generated were extracted from the gel and separated on columns of DEAE-5PW (2 × 20 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and Mightysil RP-18 (2 × 50 mm; Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) connected in series with a model 1100 (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA) liquid chromatography system. Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min, with a linear gradient of 0–60% solvent B, where solvents A and B were 0.09% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and 0.075% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 80% (v/v) acetonitrile, respectively. Selected peptides were subjected to Edman degradation in a model 477A automated protein sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) connected on-line to a model 120A PTH analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and also examined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry with a Reflex MALDI-TOF (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in linear mode, with 2-mercaptobenzothiazole used as a matrix. For cloning of full-length mouse Mad2 cDNA, PCR primers were designed according to the GenBank™ mouse Mad2 equivalent sequence of expressed sequence tag. PCR fragments were recovered by used of a TA vector (pCR2.1, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and the sequence was confirmed by using an ABI PRISM 310 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To determine whether proteins other than Jak2 bind to the box1/2 region, we conducted pull-down assays using the recombinant box1/2 region of βc and Ba/F3 cell lysates. GST protein fused with the βc box1/2 region (GST-box1/2) or the cytoplasmic region of α subunit (GST-α) were constructed, as shown in Fig.1 A. GST-box1/2, GST-α, and GST protein were purified by using a glutathione column and then incubated with the Ba/F3 cell lysate. Proteins were precipitated by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. To identify GST protein-binding proteins derived from E. coli, purified GST-box1/2, GST-α fusion proteins, and GST protein were also subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis, and all the gels were silver-stained. We then compared the six panels precisely and found two proteins that specifically bound to GST-box1/2. Fig. 1 B shows the pattern of GST-box1/2-binding proteins, and arrows indicate specific binding proteins with approximate molecular masses of 25 and 75 kDa. The 25-kDa protein was not detected in samples prepared with GST or GST-α, and only a residual amount of the 75-kDa one co-precipitated with GST or GST-α. Because these proteins were not observed in the gel with GST-box1/2 protein alone, these were probably specific binding proteins that had originated from Ba/F3 cells. We excised these spots and subjected them to microsequencing. The amino acid sequence revealed that two fragments derived from the 75-kDa protein were contained in GRP78 protein (33Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Because GRP78 exclusively localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum and its structure is closely related to Hsp-70 (33Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), we speculate that the binding of GRP78 to GM-CSFR is an artificial event only observed in an in vitro system. A fragment derived from the 25-kDa protein corresponded to amino acids 193–199 of the human Mad2 protein. As the 25-kDa spot was recognized by an anti-Mad2 antibody in two-dimensional Western blotting analysis (data not shown), this 25-kDa protein is probably the mouse counterpart of the human Mad2. We also analyzed the immunoreactivity of the anti-Mad2 antibody toward GST protein-precipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The anti-Mad2 antibody recognized a band with a molecular mass of 25 kDa, and this band was observed only with the GST-box1/2 samples incubated with the Ba/F3 cell lysate (Fig.1 C, lane 7). To determine whether the endogenous full-length βc protein binds to Mad2, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation analysis, using anti-βc antibody (specific for human βc) and Ba/F3 cells expressing hGM-CSFR. As shown in Fig. 1 D, Mad2 protein co-immunoprecipitated with βc, thereby suggesting an association of Mads with the native receptor. We next asked whether this association is direct, and for this we used a binding assay of recombinant Mad2 and box1/2 proteins. Full-length mouse Mad2 coding region cDNA was isolated by PCR using synthesizing primers according to GenBank™ mouse Mad2 equivalent sequences. The recently published sequence of the mouse Mad2 (19Dobles M. Liberal V. Scott M.L. Benezra R. Sorger P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 635-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) completely matched the sequence of our PCR product. To obtain purified Mad2 for the binding assay, we constructed histidine-tagged Mad2 protein (His-Mad2) and purified it. Then, binding activity of His-Mad2 protein and GST-box1/2, GST-α, or GST proteins was examined. As shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 1–3), when the protein complex was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, only the GST-box1/2 co-precipitated with His-Mad2. Likewise, when proteins were precipitated by Ni2+ beads, again only the GST-box1/2 co-precipitated with the His-Mad2 protein (lanes 10–12). In contrast, neither GST-α nor GST was precipitated together with His-Mad2. Lanes 4–6 and 7–9indicate that nearly the same amount of proteins precipitated in each lane. These results indicate that Mad2 association with box1/2 is specific and direct. We next examined the requirement of the box1/2 sub-region for binding to Mad2 protein, using a βc-derived peptide conjugated with SulfoLink beads. Various peptides corresponding to a portion of the box1/2 region or its derivatives were synthesized and conjugated with SulfoLink beads at their N-terminal cysteine residue (Fig.3 A). The association with Mad2 was examined by incubating these peptides with Ba/F3 cell lysate, and the proteins that bound to the peptide beads were precipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 3 B shows the Western blotting pattern obtained by using anti-Mad2 antibody for reaction with the precipitated proteins. Mad2 co-precipitated with the peptide-beads that covered the entire box1 region (lane 2). We next examined the binding potential of various box1/2-derived peptides. Neither box2 peptide nor control peptide precipitated Mad2 protein (lanes 4 and 7). Amino acids “PNP” conserved within box1 region of many cytokine receptors are thought to be critical for signal transduction as determined by mutation analysis of several receptors (12Murakami M. Narazali M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). When a peptide carrying a mutation within this conserved PNP motif (box1/ANA) was used for precipitation, the amount of co-precipitated Mad2 was significantly reduced (lane 3). It was also reported that 8 amino acid residues are critical for receptor activation (7Watanabe S. Itoh T. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12681-12686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 34Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.A. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The box1 peptide, which lacks these critical residues (ΔBox1), abrogated Mad2 precipitation (lane 6). The peptide corresponds to a joint region of box1 and box2 also could not precipitate Mad2 (lane 5). These results suggest that the conserved region of box1 plays an important role in binding to Mad2 protein. We also checked direct binding between recombinant purified His-Mad2 and these peptides, and essentially the same results (data not shown) as obtained with the Ba/F3 cell lysate emerged. To analyze the region of Mad2 required for binding to βc, we next constructed deletion mutants of Mad2, as schematically shown in Fig.4 A. Mutants were fused at their N terminus with a histidine tag for purification. Purified histidine-tagged Mad2 mutant proteins were incubated with purified GST box1/2, and the proteins were precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and analyzed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig.4 B). The GST-box1/2 could bind wild type (lane 2) as well as mutant Mad2 lacking the N-terminal portion (ΔN, lane 4), but the amount of precipitated ΔN-Mad2 was clearly less than that of the wild-type Mad2, thus indicating that the N-terminal region of Mad2 was not essential for but influenced the binding affinity between Mad2 and box1/2. In contrast, mutant Mad2 lacking the C terminus (ΔC) did not bind to GST-box1/2 (lane 3). In view of these data, we speculate that the C-terminal portion (54 residues, amino acid positions 152–205) is sufficient and is required to interact with GST-box1/2. The anti-Mad2 antibody, which recognizes the ΔN mutant but not the ΔC mutant interfered with the association between box1/2 protein and Mad2 of Ba/F3 lysates, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). In contrast, control antibodies, anti-γ-catenin, and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), did not affect Mad2 binding, thereby supporting the conclusion that the C-terminal region of Mad2 is important and sufficient for binding between box1/2 and Mad2. Mad2 associates with various cell cycle-related proteins in a cell cycle phase-dependent manner (21Fang G., Yu, H. Kirschner M.W.

To determine whether the association between Mad2 and βc is also affected during the cell cycle, we prepared HeLa cell lysates at various phases of the cell cycle.
