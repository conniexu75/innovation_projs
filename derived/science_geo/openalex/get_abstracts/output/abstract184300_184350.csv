https://openalex.org/W2130156865,"Enhancement of polarization and related properties in heteroepitaxially constrained thin films of the ferroelectromagnet, BiFeO 3 , is reported. Structure analysis indicates that the crystal structure of film is monoclinic in contrast to bulk, which is rhombohedral. The films display a room-temperature spontaneous polarization (50 to 60 microcoulombs per square centimeter) almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the bulk (6.1 microcoulombs per square centimeter). The observed enhancement is corroborated by first-principles calculations and found to originate from a high sensitivity of the polarization to small changes in lattice parameters. The films also exhibit enhanced thickness-dependent magnetism compared with the bulk. These enhanced and combined functional responses in thin film form present an opportunity to create and implement thin film devices that actively couple the magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters."

https://openalex.org/W1980056833,"Completion of cell division during cytokinesis requires temporally and spatially regulated communication from the microtubule cytoskeleton to the actin cytoskeleton and the cell membrane. We identified a specific inhibitor of nonmuscle myosin II, blebbistatin, that inhibited contraction of the cleavage furrow without disrupting mitosis or contractile ring assembly. Using blebbistatin and other drugs, we showed that exit from the cytokinetic phase of the cell cycle depends on ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Continuous signals from microtubules are required to maintain the position of the cleavage furrow, and these signals control the localization of myosin II independently of other furrow components."
https://openalex.org/W1989807773,"One of the most active current areas of chemical research is centered on how to synthesize handed (chiral) compounds in a selective manner, rather than as mixtures of mirror-image forms (enantiomers) with different three-dimensional structures (stereochemistries). Nature points the way in this endeavor: different enantiomers of a given biomolecule can exhibit dramatically different biological activities, and enzymes have therefore evolved to catalyze reactions with exquisite selectivity for the formation of one enantiomeric form over the other. Drawing inspiration from these natural catalysts, chemists have developed a variety of synthetic small-molecule catalysts that can achieve levels of selectivity approaching, and in some cases matching, those observed in enzymatic reactions."

However, many homogeneous catalytic systems cannot be commercialized because of difficulties associated with separating the products from the catalyst. Recent approaches to tackling this problem are reviewed and compared."
https://openalex.org/W1965751645,"Heterogeneous catalysis has always been an inherently nanoscopic phenomenon with important technological and societal consequences for energy conversion and the production of chemicals. New opportunities for improved performance arise when the multifunctionality inherent in catalytic processes, including molecular transport of reactants and products, is rethought in light of architectures designed and fabricated from the appropriate nanoscale building blocks, including the use of ""nothing"" (void space) and deliberate disorder as design components. Architectures with all of the appropriate electrochemical and catalytic requirements, including large surface areas readily accessible to molecules, may now be assembled on the benchtop. Designing catalytic nanoarchitectures that depart from the hegemony of periodicity and order offers the promise of even higher activity."
https://openalex.org/W2154998149,"Biocatalysis has emerged as an important tool in the industrial synthesis of bulk chemicals, pharmaceutical and agrochemical intermediates, active pharmaceuticals, and food ingredients. However, the number and diversity of the applications are modest, perhaps in part because of perceived or real limitations of biocatalysts, such as limited enzyme availability, substrate scope, and operational stability. Recent scientific breakthroughs in genomics, directed enzyme evolution, and the exploitation of biodiversity should help to overcome these limitations. As a result, we expect many new industrial applications of biocatalysis to be realized, from single-step enzymatic conversions to customized multistep microbial synthesis by means of metabolic pathway engineering."
https://openalex.org/W1989174024,"Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS or Ondine's curse; OMIM 209880) is a life-threatening disorder involving an impaired ventilatory response to hypercarbia and hypoxemia. This core phenotype is associated with lower-penetrance anomalies of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) including Hirschsprung disease and tumors of neural-crest derivatives such as ganglioneuromas and neuroblastomas. In mice, the development of ANS reflex circuits is dependent on the paired-like homeobox gene Phox2b. Thus, we regarded its human ortholog, PHOX2B, as a candidate gene in CCHS. We found heterozygous de novo mutations in PHOX2B in 18 of 29 individuals with CCHS. Most mutations consisted of 5–9 alanine expansions within a 20-residue polyalanine tract probably resulting from non-homologous recombination. We show that PHOX2B is expressed in both the central and the peripheral ANS during human embryonic development. Our data support an essential role of PHOX2B in the normal patterning of the autonomous ventilation system and, more generally, of the ANS in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1968516742,"Seckel syndrome (OMIM 210600) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, dwarfism, microcephaly and mental retardation. Clinically, Seckel syndrome shares features in common with disorders involving impaired DNA-damage responses, such as Nijmegen breakage syndrome (OMIM 251260) and LIG4 syndrome (OMIM 606593). We previously mapped a locus associated with Seckel syndrome to chromosome 3q22.1-q24 in two consanguineous Pakistani families. Further marker analysis in the families, including a recently born unaffected child with a recombination in the critical region, narrowed the region to an interval of 5 Mbp between markers D3S1316 and D3S1557 (145.29 Mbp and 150.37 Mbp). The gene encoding ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) maps to this region. A fibroblast cell line derived from an affected individual displays a defective DNA damage response caused by impaired ATR function. We identified a synonymous mutation in affected individuals that alters ATR splicing. The mutation confers a phenotype including marked microcephaly (head circumference 12 s.d. below the mean) and dwarfism (5 s.d. below the mean). Our analysis shows that UV-induced ATR activation can occur in non-replicating cells following processing by nucleotide excision repair."
https://openalex.org/W2003946492,"Loss of imprinting (LOI), an epigenetic alteration affecting the insulin-like growth factor II gene (IGF2), is found in normal colonic mucosa of about 30% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, but it is found in only 10% of healthy individuals. In a pilot study to investigate the utility of LOI as a marker of CRC risk, we evaluated 172 patients at a colonoscopy clinic. The adjusted odds ratio for LOI in lymphocytes was 5.15 for patients with a positive family history [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.70 to 16.96; probability P = 0.002], 3.46 for patients with adenomas (95% CI, 1.14 to 11.37; P = 0.026), and 21.7 for patients with CRC (95% CI, 3.48 to 153.6; P = 0.0005). LOI can be assayed with a DNA-based blood test, and it may be a valuable predictive marker of an individual's risk for CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2055791162,"Multivesicular bodies (MVBs) are endocytic structures that contain small vesicles formed by the budding of an endosomal membrane into the lumen of the compartment. Fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane results in secretion of the small internal vesicles termed exosomes. K562 cells are a hematopoietic cell line that releases exosomes. The application of monensin (MON) generated large MVBs that were labeled with a fluorescent lipid. Exosome release was markedly enhanced by MON treatment, a Na+/H+ exchanger that induces changes in intracellular calcium (Ca2+). To explore the possibility that the effect of MON on exosome release was caused via an increase in Ca2+, we have used a calcium ionophore and a chelator of intracellular Ca2+.

In antigen-presenting cells, the fusion of these MVBs with the plasma membrane leads to the release of internal vesicles into the extracellular space (1Clayton A. Court J. Navabi H. Adams M.

Although other plasma membrane proteins (e.g. acetylcholinesterase) are secreted via exosomes, these small vesicles are devoid of both cytosolic proteins and proteins associated with other intracellular organelles, indicating that only a select group of macromolecules is shed via this pathway. Exosomes are also secreted by other cell types such as activated platelets, which may function in signaling/adhesion, thus having a role at sites of vascular injury (7Heijnen H.F. Schiel A.E.

Despite the diverse extracellular functions that are carried out by exosomes, very little is known about the molecular machinery involved in either the formation of the MVBs or in the exosome secretory process. We have recently shown that in K562 cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line, overexpression of Rab11 regulates the exosome pathway (12Savina A. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of green fluorescent protein-Rab11-transfected cells with the ionophore monensin (MON) generated large MVBs decorated with Rab11 and labeled with a fluorescent lipid that accumulates in exosomes. MON, a membrane-permeable Na+ ionophore that mediates an antiporter activity exchanging Na+ ions with H+ ions (13Pressman B.C. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 501-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar), acts on acidic intracellular organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes, causing swelling of these vesicles. MON is also known to induce Ca2+ entry by reversed activity of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (14Nassar-Gentina V. Rojas E. Luxoro M. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Dömötör E. Abbott N.J. Adam-Vizi V. J.

A rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, a universal intracellular signal (for a review see Refs. 17Cullen P.J. Lockyer P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar and 18Carafoli E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), is necessary to induce regulated secretion in most cell types (reviewed in Refs.19Gerber S.H. Sudhof T.C.

During regulated exocytosis, the membrane of a secretory vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane in a tightly controlled Ca2+-triggered reaction. In endocrine cells, secretory granules contain large amounts of Ca2+ ions, and it has been suggested that the high intragranular Ca2+ concentration is needed to sustain optimal exocytosis (21Scheenen W.J. Wollheim C.B. Pozzan T. Fasolato C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19002-19008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because MON generates large MVBs in K562 cells, the aim of the present study was to determine whether MON affects exosome release and establish whether Ca2+ is involved in this process. Our results indicate that both MON treatment and a rise in intracellular Ca2+ markedly stimulate exosome secretion. Furthermore, the MON-stimulated exosome release was a Ca2+-dependent process. Interestingly, we have also observed that MON induced the accumulation of Ca2+ in the enlarged MVBs, suggesting that intravesicular Ca2+ might be involved in the secretory step. To determine whether a physiological signal might regulate the Ca2+-dependent exosome release, cells were incubated with transferrin (Tf). Our results indicate that Tf stimulates exosome release in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Materials—RPMI cell culture medium and fetal calf serum were obtained from Invitrogen. EGTA-acetoxymethyl ester (AM), BAPTA-AM, and A23187 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fura2-AM, Fluo3-AM, xestopongin C, cyclopiazonic acid, and 2-aminoethoxy-diphenylborate (2-APB) were from Calbiochem. N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine (N-Rh-PE) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Acetylthiocholine and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) were obtained from Sigma. Bodipy-TR ceramide and Hoechst 33342 were from Molecular Probes. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or ICN Biochemicals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). Cell Culture—K562, a human erythroleukemia cell line, was grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and penicillin (50 units/ml). Exosome Isolation—Exosomes were collected from 10 ml of K562 media (15–20 × 106 cells) cultured over 7–15 h. The culture media were collected on ice, centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to sediment the cells, and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min to remove the cellular debris. Exosomes were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The exosome pellet was washed once in a large volume of PBS and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS (exosome fraction). Quantitation of Released Exosomes—The amount of released exosomes was quantitated by measuring the activity of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that is specifically directed to these vesicles (12Savina A. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylcholinesterase activity was assayed following a previously described procedure (22Ho I.K. Ellman G.L. J. Neurochem. 1969; 16: 1505-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μl of the exosome fraction were suspended in 100 μl of phosphate buffer and incubated with 1.25 mm acetylthiocholine and 0.1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in a final volume of 1 ml. The incubation was carried out in cuvettes at 37 °C, and the change in absorbance at 412 nm was followed continuously. The data represent the enzymatic activity at 20 min of incubation. As an independent assay, exosomes were quantitated by determining the levels of the protein Hsc70 by Western blot. Samples of the exosomal fraction (15 μl) were solubilized in reducing SDS loading buffer, incubated for 5 min at 95 °C, run on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to an Immobilon (Millipore) membrane. The membranes were blocked for 1h in Blotto (5% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20, and PBS) and subsequently washed twice with PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 or Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The corresponding bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) and quantitated by densitometry. Labeling MVBs with the Fluorescent Lipid N-Rh-PE and Fluo3-AM for Imaging Calcium—The fluorescent phospholipid analog N-Rh-PE was inserted into the plasma membrane as described previously (23Willem J. ter Beest M. Scherphof G. Hoekstra D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 53: 173-184PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, an appropriate amount of the lipid, stored in chloroform/methanol (2:1), was dried under nitrogen and subsequently solubilized in absolute ethanol. This ethanolic solution was injected with a Hamilton syringe into serum-free RPMI (<1%, v/v) while vigorously vortexing. The mixture was then added to the cells, which were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. After this incubation period, the medium was removed, and the cells were extensively washed with cold PBS to remove excess unbound lipids. After the addition of complete RPMI medium and Fluo3-AM (15 μm), labeled cells were cultured for 2–3 h under conditions as described and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were mounted on coverslips and immediately analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. In some experiments, the cells were preloaded with Fluo3-AM by incubating for 60 min at 37 °C before labeling with the fluorescent lipid. No major differences were observed between these experimental procedures. Fluorescence Microscopy—K562 cells were analyzed using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE 300, Japan) equipped with the following filter systems: excitation filter 450–490 nm, barrier filter 515 nm to visualize Fluo3-AM; and excitation filter 510–560 nm, barrier filter 590 nm to localize N-Rh-PE. Images were captured with a CCD camera (Orca I, Hamamatsu) and processed using the program Meta-Morph 4.5 (Universal Images Corporation). Some images were obtained with a Nikon Confocal C1 and processed with the EZ-C1 program. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Concentration—Cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μm Fura2-AM for 60 min at 37 °C. They were washed to remove the extracellular dye and resuspended in complete RPMI medium containing 1 × 106 cells/ml. Fura2-AM loaded cells were protected from light. Experiments were completed within 2 h. Changes in fluorescence after the addition of 7 μm MON or by adding 30 μm BAPTA-AM before MON were analyzed in a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Monensin Induces the Formation of Large MVBs and Stimulates Exosome Secretion—K562 cells are human erythroleukemic cells that secrete exosomes (24Johnstone R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the small internal vesicles released into the extracellular media by fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane (PM). It has been shown by electron microscopy that treatment of K562 cells with the ionophore MON causes the formation of dilated MVBs (25Stein B.S. Bensch K.G. Sussman H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14762-14772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Savina A. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which these large MVBs are formed and the effect of MON on exosome release have not been explored. To get insights into these issues, MVBs in K562 cells were labeled with the fluorescent lipid analog N-Rh-PE. Sucrose gradient analysis and immunoisolation experiments have demonstrated that this lipid is efficiently internalized via endocytosis and targeted to the MVBs. Indeed, N-Rh-PE accumulates in exosomes that are eventually secreted into the extracellular medium (12Savina A. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Vidal M. Mangeat P. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lipid N-Rh-PE was first bound to the PM at 4 °C, and cells were washed and subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in the absence or the presence of 7 μm MON. As shown in Fig. 1A, MON treatment caused the formation of large MVBs labeled by the fluorescent lipid. In Fig. 1B a confocal image of the MVBs formed is shown, with the internal vesicles labeled with the fluorescent lipid clearly depicted. Because fusion of the MVBs with the PM results in the release of exosomes, we tested the effect of MON on the release of exosomes from K562 cells. Exosomes are enriched in proteins such as the transferrin receptor (TfR), Hsc70, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (27Johnstone R.M. Bianchini A. Teng K. Blood. 1989; 74: 1844-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, exosomes were quantitated in the exosomal fraction by measuring the activity of AChE (see “Experimental Procedures”). Also, the amount of Hsc70 and TfR was determined by Western blot as described previously (12Savina A. Vidal M. Colombo M.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2505-2515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exosomes were harvested from the extracellular media after 7-h incubations with different concentrations of MON and quantitated by determining the levels of the proteins Hsc70 (Fig. 1C) and TfR (not shown) by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1C, MON induced a marked increase in exosome release in a concentration-dependent manner. A similar increase was observed by measuring, in the exosomal fraction, the activity of AChE (Fig. 1D), which was maximal at 10 μm MON. At higher MON concentrations some alterations in cell viability were observed as assessed by trypan blue exclusion, for which reason a 7 μm concentration of MON was used in the rest of the experiments. At this concentration, cells were also assayed for apoptosis by staining the nucleus with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). No morphological evidence of apoptotic nuclei was observed (data not shown). In some experiments, the amount of exosomes released was also quantified by assaying the fluorescent lipid N-Rh-PE. As mentioned above, this lipid accumulates in intracellular vesicles that are ultimately secreted into the extracellular medium as exosomes. As expected, MON also increased the release of exosomes labeled with the fluorescent lipid (data not shown). Taken together the results indicate that MON not only generates large MVBs but also increases the secretion of the internal vesicles termed exosomes. A Calcium-dependent Mechanism Is Involved in the Monensin-stimulated Exosome Release—It has been shown that MON, a Na+ ionophore, can increase cytosolic Ca2+ by reversing the Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism (14Nassar-Gentina V. Rojas E. Luxoro M. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Dömötör E. Abbott N.J. Adam-Vizi V. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Wang X.D. Kiang J.G. Scheibel L.W. Smallridge R.C. J. Investig. Med. 1999; 47: 388-396PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to assess whether in our system the enhanced exosome release induced by MON was due to an increase in intracellular Ca2+, we first measured whether MON could modify the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in K562 cells. For this purpose, cells were loaded for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 μm Fura-2/AM. Subsequently, the intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured by spectrofluorometry for different periods of time after the addition of MON. Fig. 2A shows that there was an initial Ca2+ peak and a subsequent marked rise in intracellular Ca2+ that was sustained over the 2-h period tested (Fig. 2B). The MON-induced Ca2+ rise was abolished by the previous addition of the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, in the presence of the extracellular Ca2+ chelator EGTA, MON induced the initial rise, which was likely due to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. However, no sustained increase was observed, indicating that the latter is a result of Ca2+ influx from the extracellular environment (data not shown). The results suggest that the increase in exosome release might be due to a Ca2+-dependent mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether the MON effect on exosome release could also be prevented by Ca2+ chelators. To chelate the Ca2+ present in the extracellular media, cells were incubated for several hours in the presence of 1.5 mm EGTA. Under these conditions, the free Ca2+ concentration was less than 10 nm as calculated with the Sliders program (see “Experimental Procedures”). BAPTA-AM was used to chelate intracellular Ca2+, because this is a membrane-permeable agent that efficiently chelates Ca2+. The released exosomes were collected from the media and quantitated by measuring AChE activity as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2C, both EGTA and BAPTA-AM decreased, although slightly, the basal release of exosomes. Moreover, the MON-dependent increase was completely abrogated by the Ca2+ chelators, and no additive effects were observed when both chelators were added together (data not shown). The result clearly indicates that Ca2+ from the extracellular media and also from intracellular stores is required for the MON-induced exosome secretion. Ca2+ involvement in exosome release was evaluated using the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. As shown in Fig. 3A, incubation with the Ca2+ ionophore stimulated exosome secretion to a similar extent as MON. No additive effects were observed when both agents were added together. As expected, the secretory effect of the Ca2+ ionophore was inhibited by the chelators EGTA or BAPTA-AM (Fig. 3B). It is known that MON acts on acidic compartments by altering the proton gradient across vesicle membranes, resulting in a Ca2+ movement into the cytosol (28Christensen K. Myers J. Swanson J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 115: 599-607Crossref Google Scholar). We tested the effect of two agents known to alter the pH of vacuolar compartments, the weak base chloroquine and the vacuolar proton pump inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (29Mousavi S.A. Kjeken R. Berg T.O. Seglen P.O. Berg T. Brech A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that these compounds may also discharge intracellular Ca2+ pools from acidic compartments (30Passos A.P. Garcia C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Beraldo F.H. Sartorello R. Lanari R.D. Garcia C.R. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have evidence that chloroquine elevated intracellular Ca2+ in a similar manner to MON (not shown). As shown in Fig. 4A, chloroquine stimulated the release of exosomes, although to a lesser degree than MON. Non-additive effects were observed by the addition of chloroquine together with MON. Bafilomycin also increased the release of exosomes (Fig. 4B). Both chloroquine and bafilomycin effects were abrogated by clamping extracellular Ca2+ with the chelator EGTA, indicating that these compounds indeed act via a calcium-dependent mechanism. Visualizing a MVB Calcium Pool by Fluo3-AM Imaging— Numerous reports indicate the existence of several intracellular Ca2+ pools (32Martinez J.R. Willis S. Puente S. Wells J. Helmke R. Zhang G.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); for a review see Refs. 33Verkhratsky A. Shmigol A.

Fluo3-AM is a membrane-permeant compound that accumulates in the cytoplasm where cytosolic esterases clip the AM groups, rendering the fluorescent probe membrane impermeable. However, it has been shown that, when used at higher concentrations, part of this indicator is capable of accumulating also in intracellular compartments and can be used as an indicator for intracellular Ca2+ stores (35Takahashi A. Camacho P. Lechleiter J.D. Herman B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1089-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with Fluo3-AM for 1 h at 37 °C to visualize the calcium-containing compartments. MVBs were labeled with the fluorescent lipid N-Rh-PE as mentioned above, and the cells were subsequently incubated with the indicated agents for 3 h at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 5, the large MVBs induced by MON treatment were clearly labeled by Fluo3-AM, indicating that Ca2+ accumulates in these intracellular compartments. Similarly, Ca2+ was also present in the large MVBs formed by chloroquine treatment. The presence of BAPTA-AM depleted the MVBs calcium pool in both conditions. Strikingly, the size of the MVBs was markedly reduced, indicating that a calcium-dependent mechanism is involved in the development of the gigantic MVBs formed by MON or chloroquine treatment. Calcium Levels Regulated by IP3Receptors and a Thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+Pump Are Involved in the Release of Exosome—It is well established that thapsigargin (TG) causes a rapid inhibition of the calcium-ATPase pump present in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (36Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar), followed by a fast Ca2+ leak from other Ca2+ stores as well as influx from the extracellular media. This leads to a rapid and pronounced increase in the concentration of cytosolic-free calcium. As expected, treatment of K562 wells with this inhibitor stimulated exosome secretion in a similar manner as MON, and this effect was also blocked by EGTA (Fig. 6A). These findings confirmed a role for Ca2+ in the exosome secretory pathway and the participation of a TG-sensitive Ca2+ pump in the process. Because TG stimulated exosome release, we were interested in knowing whether the large MVBs developed by MON were also formed by treatment with TG. As shown in Fig. 6B, TG neither generated large MVBs nor impaired the formation of the MON-induced gigantic structures that were filled with calcium. This suggests that an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ is not by itself enough to generate the enlarged MVBs, despite being sufficient to stimulate exosome secretion. The phosphoinositide signaling cascade plays a prominent role in the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (for a review see Refs. 37Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar and 38Balla T. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2001; 7: 475-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The receptors for the second messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), constitute a family of Ca2+ channels responsible for the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. The increase in the levels of IP3 result in the opening of Ca2+ channels present in the endoplasmic reticulum and the subsequent release of Ca2+ into the cytosol (39Taylor C.W. Richardson A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 97-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To test whether this type of channel might be involved in the calcium-induced exosome release, cells were incubated with 2-APB, a membrane-permeable inhibitor of IP3-induced Ca2+ release. Fig. 6C shows that 2-APB inhibited monensin-stimulated exosome release. Similar results were obtained with xestopongin, a potent blocker of IP3 receptors (data not shown), indicating that a transient Ca2+ rise mediated by the stimulation of an IP3 receptor is critical for the MON-stimulated exosome release. However, the formation of the large Ca2+-rich MVBs induced by MON was not completely abrogated by 2-APB (Fig. 6D), although there was a decrease in the size of the MVBs compared with the vesicles generated by MON in the absence of 2-APB. Vesicle area in the MON-treated cells was 436 ± 30 (relative units), whereas the addition of 2-APB reduced the size to 182 ± 16 (n = 50 vesicles counted). This suggests that the release of Ca2+ via the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channels contributes, at least in part, to the generation of the enlarged MVBs. The Formation of the Gigantic MVBs Filled with Calcium Are Completely Blocked by Amiloride—The results presented here indicate that Ca2+ is absolutely required for generation of the enlarged MVBs, because these structures are not formed in the presence of BAPTA-AM (see above). However, even though IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channels seem to participate in the process, the development of the large MVBs was only partly decreased by specific modulators. This implies that another type of Ca2+ channel (see “Discussion”) is involved in the MON-dependent Ca2+ rise and the accumulation of Ca2+ in the MVBs. It is known that the rapid sodium influx initiated by MON increases cytosolic Ca2+ by reversing the Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism. Therefore, because the activity of a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger seems to be critical for the MON effect, we tested dimethyl amiloride, an inhibitor of the H+/Na+ and Na+/Ca2+ exchangers. As shown in Fig. 7A, amiloride decreased the basal exosome release and also completely inhibited the MON-stimulated secretion of exosomes. As expected, the formation of the gigantic Ca2+-filled MVBs generated by MON-treatment was completely abrogated by amiloride. In contrast, the process was not affected by verapamil, an inhibitor of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (data not shown). These results are consistent with the idea that activation of a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is a prerequisite for the Ca2+ rise in the cytoplasm that leads to exosome secretion and the formation of the enlarged MVBs filled with Ca2+ generated by MON. Transferrin Stimulates Exosome Release in a Calcium-dependent Manner—Taken together the results discussed above clearly indicate that Ca2+ is a key participant in the exosome release process. Therefore, we were interested in addressing whether a physiological stimulus might also enhance exosome secretion in a Ca2+-dependent manner. As mentioned previously, K562 is a human erythroleukemia cell line that presents high levels of TfR, and, because it has been shown th"

Concurrent with mwp-1A was the onset of the Bølling-Allerød interstadial event (14,600 years before the present), which marked the termination of the last glacial period. Previous studies have been unable to reconcile a warm Northern Hemisphere with mwp-1A originating from the Laurentide or Fennoscandian ice sheets. With the use of a climate model of intermediate complexity, we demonstrate that with mwp-1A originating from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, consistent with recent sea-level fingerprinting inferences, the strength of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation increases, thereby warming the North Atlantic region and providing an explanation for the onset of the Bølling-Allerød warm interval. The established mode of active NADW formation is then able to respond to subsequent freshwater forcing from the Laurentide and Fennoscandian ice sheets, setting the stage for the Younger Dryas cold period."

Broadly virulent pathogens occurred more frequently in highly resistant host populations, whereas avirulent pathogens dominated susceptible populations. Experimental inoculations indicated a negative trade-off between spore production and virulence. The nonrandom spatial distribution of pathogens, maintained through time despite high pathogen mobility, implies that selection favors virulent strains of Melampsora lini in resistant Linum marginale populations and avirulent strains in susceptible populations. These results are consistent with gene-for-gene models of host-pathogen coevolution that require trade-offs to prevent pathogen virulence increasing until host resistance becomes selectively neutral."

We purified the protein insertion complex (TIM22 complex), a twin-pore translocase that mediated the insertion of precursor proteins in a three-step process. After the precursor is tethered to the translocase without losing energy from the Δψ, two energy-requiring steps were needed. First, Δψ acted on the precursor protein and promoted its docking in the translocase complex. Then, Δψ and an internal signal peptide together induced rapid gating transitions in one pore and closing of the other pore and drove membrane insertion to completion. Thus, protein insertion was driven by the coordinated action of a twin-pore complex in two voltage-dependent steps."

However, raising animals in benign environments may promote traits that are adaptive in captivity but maladaptive in nature. In chinook salmon, hatchery rearing relaxes natural selection favoring large eggs, allowing fecundity selection to drive exceptionally rapid evolution of small eggs. Trends toward small eggs are also evident in natural populations heavily supplemented by hatcheries, but not in minimally supplemented populations. Unintentional selection in captivity can lead to rapid changes in critical life-history traits that may reduce the success of supplementation or reintroduction programs."

The increase in spring cloud amount radiatively balances changes in surface temperature and albedo, but during summer, fall, and winter, cloud forcing has tended toward increased cooling. This implies that, if seasonal cloud amounts were not changing, surface warming would be even greater than that observed. Strong correlations with the Arctic Oscillation indicate that the rise in surface temperature and changes in cloud amount are related to large-scale circulation rather than to local processes."

It facilitates the efflux of cholesterol from cells in peripheral tissues to HDL and mediates the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from HDL in the liver. We investigated the effects of SRBI deficiency in the arterial wall and in the liver using SRBI-deficient mice and wild-type littermates fed a Western-type diet. The SRBI-deficient mice showed massive accumulation of cholesterol-rich HDL in the circulation, reflecting impaired delivery to the liver. Strikingly, SRBI deficiency did not alter hepatic cholesterol (ester) content nor did it affect the expression of key regulators of hepatic cholesterol homeostasis, including HMG-CoA reductase, the low density lipoprotein receptor, and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. However, a ∼40% reduction in biliary cholesterol content was observed, and the expression of ABCG8 and ABCG5, ATP half-transporters implicated in the transport of sterols from the liver to the bile, was attenuated by 70 and 35%, respectively. In contrast to the situation in the liver, SRBI deficiency did result in lipid deposition in the aorta and atherosclerosis. Vascular mRNA analysis showed increased expression of inflammatory markers as well as of genes involved in cellular cholesterol homeostasis.

Stimulation of reverse transport of cholesterol from cells of the arterial wall to the liver is considered the mechanism by which HDL exerts its anti-atherogenic properties (3Glomset J.A. Adv. Intern. Med. 1980; 25: 91-116Google Scholar). In addition, interaction of HDL with the arterial wall directly protects against oxidative stress and vascular inflammation (4Van Lenten B.J. Navab M. Shih D. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. Trends Cardiovas. Med. 2001; 11: 155-161Google Scholar).An important mediator of HDL metabolism is scavenger receptor class B, type I (SRBI) (5Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschultz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar). SRBI is a multifunctional receptor capable of binding a wide array of native and modified lipoproteins. SRBI is abundantly expressed in liver and steroi-dogenic tissues, where it mediates the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from HDL (6Landschultz K.T. Pathak R.P. Rigotti A. Krieger M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Google Scholar, 7Stangl H. Hyatt M. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32692-32698Google Scholar). A definitive role for SRBI in HDL metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport in vivo has been demonstrated using different transgenic and knockout mouse models. Hepatic overexpression of SRBI is accompanied by decreased levels of HDL cholesterol (8Ueda Y. Gong E. Royer L. Copper P.N. Francone O.L. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20368-20373Google Scholar, 9Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Google Scholar). Furthermore, targeted inactivation of SRBI induced a 2-fold increase in plasma cholesterol levels due to the accumulation of abnormally large, heterogeneous HDL (10Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M.

When cross-bred onto the apolipoprotein E knockout background, SRBI deficiency leads to severe cardiac dysfunction and premature death (11Trigatti B. Rayburn H. Vinals M. Braun A. Miettinen H.

Rosenberg R.D. Schrenzel M. Krieger M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 270-276Google Scholar). Hepatic overexpression of SRBI, on the other hand, protects against the development of atherosclerosis (13Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Glick J.M. Krieger M. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 721-727Google Scholar).In addition to the liver, SRBI is also expressed by cells within the arterial wall, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages (14Yeh Y.C.

At least in macrophages, SRBI has been implicated in the bi-directional flux of cholesterol and phospholipids between HDL and the cell membrane (17Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C.

However, whether vascular SRBI plays a direct role in arterial lipid homeostasis or in HDL-mediated anti-atherogenic effects is currently unknown.In this study, the differential effects of SRBI deficiency on lipid metabolism and related gene expression in cells of the liver and the arterial wall were evaluated in response to a challenge with an atherogenic diet. We show that, despite an impaired delivery of HDL cholesterol to the liver in SRBI–/– mice, hepatic cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by processes involving down-regulation of ABCG5/ABCG8 and up-regulation of ABCG1. In contrast, SRBI deficiency in the arterial wall results in de-regulation of vascular lipid homeostasis and induction of inflammation culminating in atherosclerosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice—SRBI-deficient mice were kindly provided by Dr. M. Krieger (10Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Google Scholar). Heterozygous SRBI-deficient mice were cross-bred to generate wild-type (SRBI+/+), heterozygous (SRBI+/–), and homozygous (SRBI–/–) progeny. The presence of the targeted and wild-type SRBI alleles was assessed by PCR amplification of DNA extracted from tail biopsies (primers 5′-GAT-GGG-ACA-TGG-GAC-ACG-AAG-CCA-TTCT-3′ and 5′-TCT-GTC-TCC-GTC-TCC-TTC-AGG-TCC-TGA-3′). Mice were maintained on sterilized regular chow containing 4.3% (w/w) fat and no cholesterol (RM3, Special Diet Services, Witham, UK). At 12–16 weeks of age, the diet was switched to a semi-synthetic high fat/high cholesterol Western-type diet containing 15% (w/w) fat and 0.25% (w/w) cholesterol (Diet W, Hope Farms, Woerden, The Netherlands). After 20 weeks of feeding the Western-type diet, the mice were anesthetized, and blood and gall bladder bile were collected for lipid analyses. Subsequently, a whole-body perfusion was performed using phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA (4 °C, 100 mm of Hg) for 20 min. After perfusion, the liver, aortic arch (from the base of the aorta to just below the left subclavian artery), and heart plus aortic root were excised. The aortic arch and liver were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C until RNA isolation. The heart plus aortic root were stored in 3.7% formalin. All experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee for animal experiments of Leiden University.In Vivo Analysis of HDL Cholesteryl Ester Delivery to the Liver— Human HDL was isolated by differential ultracentrifugation as described by Redgrave et al. (19Redgrave T.G. Roberts D.C.K. West C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 65: 42-49Google Scholar) and subsequently labeled with [3H]cholesterol oleate (Amersham Biosciences) by exchange from donor particles as reported previously (20Pieters M.N. Schouten D. Bakkeren H.F. Esbach B. Brouwer A. Knook D.L. Th Van Berkel C J. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 359-365Google Scholar). The radiolabeled HDL was injected via the vena cava inferior of anesthetized mice. After 4 h of circulation, blood was sampled, and the liver was excised. The associated radioactivity was determined in a Packard liquid scintillation counter after combustion in a Packard sample oxidizer.Lipid Analyses—Serum concentrations of cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and triglycerides were determined using enzymatic colorimetric assays (Roche Applied Science). The distribution of cholesterol over the different lipoproteins in serum was analyzed by fractionation of 30 μlof serum of each mouse using a Superose 6 column (3.2 × 30 mm, Smart-system, Amersham Biosciences). Total cholesterol content of the effluent was determined using enzymatic colorimetric assays (Roche Applied Science), taking the efficiency of recovery from the column into account. HDL was isolated from pooled sera by density-gradient ultracentrifugation, and cholesteryl ester, free cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid contents of the isolated HDL were determined as described. The protein content of the HDL fractions was determined according to Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Hepatic and biliary lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). After dissolving the lipids in 2% Triton X-100, the contents of cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and triglycerides in liver tissue were determined as described above and expressed as nmol/mg of protein. Biliary bile salt and cholesterol concentrations were determined according to Setchell et al. (23Setchell K.D. Lawson A.M. Tanida N. Sjovall J. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1085-1100Google Scholar) and Gamble et al. (24Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Google Scholar), respectively.Assessment of Lesion Formation in the Aortic Root—Serial sections of the aortic root were cut using a Leica CM3050S cryostat. The atherosclerotic lesion area was quantified in oil red O-stained cryostat sections using the Leica image analysis system, consisting of a Leica DMRE microscope coupled to a video camera and Leica Qwin Imaging software (Leica Ltd., Cambridge, England). Mean lesion area (in μm2) was calculated from 10 consecutive oil red O-stained sections, starting at the appearance of the tricuspid valves.Analysis of Gene Expression by Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from liver and aortic arch by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform extraction method according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml glycogen. cDNA was synthesized from 0.5–1 μg of total RNA using RevertAid™ Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. mRNA levels were quantitatively determined on an ABI Prism® 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR®-green technology according to manufacturer's instructions.

For each sample, both the Ct for the gene of interest and for the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase were determined to calculate ΔCt,sample (Ct,target gene – Ct,housekeeping gene), thus normalizing the data and correcting for differences in amount and/or quality between the different RNA samples. The expression levels were related to an external calibrator consisting of a cDNA pool of different mouse organs (i.e. liver, spleen, lung, muscle, and aorta, each represented equally). Subsequently, ΔΔCt (ΔCt,sample – ΔCt,calibrator) was determined, and the relative expression levels were calculated from 2–ΔΔCt, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). mRNA expression levels are, thus, indicated as arbitrary units ± S.E.Immunoblot Analysis—Liver homogenate was prepared by lysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% SDS containing 0.02 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.02 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.02 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the protein concentration was determined according to Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels and electrophoretically transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schnell). Immunolabeling was performed using either rabbit polyclonal αSRBI (anti-BI495 (26Webb N.R. Connell P.M. Graf G.A. Smart E.J. De Villiers W.J.S. De Beer F.C. Van der Westhuyzen D.R. J. Biol.

Finally, immunolabeling was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).Statistical Analyses—Statistical significant differences among the means of the different groups of mice were tested using analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls multicomparison test (Graphpad Instat software, San Diego, CA).RESULTSA High Cholesterol Western-type Diet Results in Accumulation of Cholesteryl Ester-rich HDL in Serum of SRBI-deficient Mice—On chow diet, containing 4.3% fat and no cholesterol, SRBI deficiency induced a 1.8-fold increase in total serum cholesterol levels (p < 0.001, Table II). Interestingly, this increase in total cholesterol levels was mainly a result of a 3.2-fold increase in free cholesterol (p < 0.001, Table II). As indicated in Fig. 1a, changes in serum cholesterol levels were caused by a marked increase in the amounts of cholesterol transported by HDL. So far these findings confirmed the role of SRBI in determining circulating HDL levels (10Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Google Scholar). Subsequently, we challenged the SRBI-deficient mice with a Western-type diet containing 15% fat and 0.25% cholesterol for a period of 20 weeks. The length of the dietary period was chosen such that effects on vascular function and atherosclerosis, if present, could also be assessed. Remarkably, the atherogenic diet resulted in a dramatic further accumulation of HDL cholesterol, with only minor effects on VLDL cholesterol levels (Fig. 1b). Upon dietary induction, the cholesterol distribution in the heterozygous SRBI-deficient littermates was similar to that of wild-type controls, except for a tendency toward slightly increased VLDL cholesterol levels. Compositional lipid analysis of HDL, isolated after 20 weeks Western-type diet, showed that the free cholesterol content was 4.5% in HDL from wild types and 9.6% in HDL from SRBI knockouts. Cholesteryl ester contents were 18.8 and 32.7% in wild-type and SRBI-deficient mice, respectively, whereas the corresponding percentages for phospholipids amounted to 40.6 and 23.6%, respectively. There was no effect of SRBI deficiency on the protein content of the isolated HDL. Thus, SRBI deficiency in combination with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia resulted in the accumulation of large HDLs enriched in cholesteryl esters and free cholesterol and depleted of phospholipids. There was no effect of SRBI deficiency on serum triglyceride levels under both dietary conditions.Table IIEffect of SRBI deficiency on serum lipid levelsMiceTimeDietnTriglyceridesTotal cholesterolFree cholesterolCholesteryl estersHDL cholesteryl estersweeksmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlSRBI+/+0Chow6108 ± 1593 ± 724 ± 170 ± 649.1 ± 620WTD698 ± 8122 ± 1228 ± 394 ± 1061.5 ± 8SRBI+/-0Chow5118 ± 20139 ± 6ap < 0.01.36 ± 3ap < 0.01.103 ± 4ap < 0.01.81.2 ± 5ap < 0.01.20WTD597 ± 12185 ± 8bp < 0.001.47 ± 1bp < 0.001.138 ± 7ap < 0.01.86.8 ± 5cp < 0.05.SRBI-/-0Chow599 ± 4167 ± 10bp < 0.001.81 ± 3bp < 0.001.88 ± 7ap < 0.01.76 ± 7ap < 0.01.20WTD596 ± 11322 ± 20bp < 0.001.150 ± 20bp < 0.001.172 ± 9bp < 0.001.138 ± 10bp < 0.001.a p < 0.01.b p < 0.001.c p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Maintenance of Hepatic Lipid Homeostasis in SRBI-deficient Mice—In wild-type mice, the liver is responsible for the removal of the majority of the cholesteryl esters (CEs) from HDL. When injected with 3H-labeled HDL, 31.3 ± 4.5% of the injected dose was recovered from the liver in wild-type mice 4 h after administration. In the absence of SRBI, uptake of cholesteryl esters was reduced by ∼90% to only 3.3 ± 0.8% of the injected dose (p < 0.05). A similar value was found for 125I-labeled tyramine cellobiose-labeled HDL, indicative for whole particle uptake (data not shown), suggesting that in SRBI knockout mice, the selective uptake is completely abolished. Correction for the HDL-CE pool size indicated the HDL-CE mass influx into the liver was reduced from 22.0 ± 3.8 μg of HDL-CE/hour in wild-type mice to 4.1 ± 0.7 μg of HDL-CE/h in SRBI knockout animals. Reduced delivery of HDL cholesteryl esters to the liver is, thus, most likely the cause of the accumulation of large cholesterol-enriched HDL particles in the circulation of the SRBI-deficient mice (Table II, Fig. 1). Interestingly, this did not affect the hepatic levels of free cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and triglycerides (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2Effect of SRBI deficiency on hepatic and biliary cholesterol content. Hepatic (a) and biliary (b) cholesterol content was analyzed in SRBI+/+, SRBI+/–, and SRBI–/– mice after 20 weeks feeding of a high cholesterol Western-type diet. Values represent the mean ± S.E. of 5– 6 mice. *, statistically significant difference of p < 0.05 compared with SRBI+/+ mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Real-time PCR was subsequently used to determine the expression of genes involved in maintaining liver cholesterol homeostasis. In accordance with the observed similar hepatic lipid levels, there was no significant effect on the mRNA expression levels of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase and of the LDL receptor (Fig. 3), both of which are regulated by the hepatic cholesterol content. Similarly, the expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase was not affected. Other genes involved in hepatic cholesterol metabolism, including CD36, scavenger receptor class A, LDL receptor-related protein, and apolipoprotein E (apoE) were also not affected by the absence of SRBI (Fig. 3). Collectively, the data indicate that the expression of key regulators in de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, cholesterol uptake from native and modified lipoproteins, and cholesterol breakdown (28Russell D.W. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1992; 6: 103-110Google Scholar) are not affected by SRBI deficiency and reduced delivery of HDL cholesterol to the liver.Fig. 3Effect of SRBI deficiency on hepatic mRNA expression of genes involved in lipid homeostasis. mRNA levels of the indicated genes in livers of SRBI+/+, SRBI+/–, and SRBI–/– mice were quantified using real-time PCR with SYBR®-green detection after 20 weeks high cholesterol Western-type diet feeding. Values are in arbitrary units (A.U.) and represent the mean ± S.E. of 5– 6 mice. *, statistically significant difference of p < 0.05 compared with SRBI+/+ mice. **, statistically significant difference of p < 0.01 compared with SRBI+/+ mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)SRBI deficiency, however, did coincide with an approximate 40% reduction in biliary cholesterol content normalized to bile salt content (Fig. 2b). Two members of the ABCG subfamily of ABC transporters that have recently been implicated in the efflux of sterols from the liver into the bile are the co-operating half-transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8 (29Yu L. Hawkins J.-L. Hammer R.E. Berge K.E. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 671-680Google Scholar). Interestingly, ABCG5 and ABCG8 mRNA expression was attenuated by 35 and 70% (p < 0.05), respectively, in mice lacking SRBI as compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3). Other members of the family of ABC transporters implicated in sterol trafficking are ABCA1 and ABCG1 (30Schmitz G. Langmann T. Heimerl S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1513-1520Google Scholar, 31Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Google Scholar). SRBI deficiency did not affect ABCA1 mRNA expression. For most genes mRNA expression strongly correlates with protein expression. ABCA1 mRNA levels, however, appear to be a poor predictor for protein expression levels (27Wellington C.L. Walker E.K.Y. Suarez A. Kwok A. Bissada N. Singaraja R. Yang Y.-Z. Zhang L.-H. James E. Wilson J.E. Francone O. McManus B.M. Hayden M.R. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 273-283Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to ABCA1 mRNA analysis, the protein expression was determined by immunoblotting. In accordance with the mRNA data, SRBI deficiency did not influence the protein expression of ABCA1 (Fig. 4). Although ABCA1 expression was not affected, ABCG1 expression was stimulated 4.3-fold (p < 0.05) in the absence of SRBI (Fig. 3), suggesting a compensatory function of ABCG1 in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in the livers of mice lacking SRBI.Fig. 4Protein expression of SRBI and ABCA1 in livers of SRBI+/+, SRBI+/-, and SRBI-/- mice after 20-week Western-type diet feeding. Hepatic lysates (75 and 25 μg for detection of SRBI and ABCA1, respectively) were separated on non-reducing 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-BI495 or AC-10 for detection of SRBI or ABCA1, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Lipid Deposition and Vascular Inflammation in SRBI-deficient Mice—Although the liver has several established mechanisms to maintain lipid homeostasis, the arterial wall mainly relies on cholesterol efflux pathways to prevent its accumulation. Vascular tissue was analyzed after 20 weeks of feeding the mice a Western-type diet to examine the effects of SRBI disruption and hypercholesterolemia on arterial wall morphology and function. As shown in Fig. 5, SRBI deficiency led to a 72-fold (p < 0.001) increase in mean atherosclerotic lesion area, i.e. from 0.8 ± 0.4 × 103 μm2 in wild-type mice to 60 ± 6 × 103 μm2 in mice lacking SRBI. Lesions consisted primarily of fatty streaks with oil red O-positive lipid-laden macrophages (Fig. 5b). Heterozygous SRBI-deficient mice did not display any lipid deposition in the arterial wall, in line with the minor effects on serum HDL cholesterol levels when compared with wild-type littermates.Fig. 5SRBI deficiency induces atherosclerotic lesion development.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of SRBI deficiency on the mRNA expression of genes involved in these two processes was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 6a, SRBI deficiency led to a significant induction of genes implicated in adhesion and transendothelial migration of monocytes, including P-selectin (2-fold, p < 0.05), E-selectin (4-fold, p < 0.05), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (2-fold, p < 0.01). The induction of these genes coincided with a 2-fold (p < 0.05) increase in CD68 expression, indicative of an increase in the amount of macrophages present within the arterial wall. The observed increase in inflammatory markers may, thus, be directly related to atherosclerotic lesion development. SRBI deficiency also led to a significant induction of genes implicated in cholesterol efflux from macrophages, including apoE (2-fold, p < 0.05), ABCA1 (3-fold, p < 0.001), and ABCG1 (7-fold, p < 0.001) (Fig. 6b). The increase in expression of these genes was more pronounced than the increase in CD68 expression, suggesting cellular activation in addition to infiltration. ApoE and ABCA1 as well as ABCG1 are cholesterol-responsive genes that show increased expression upon cholesterol loading of macrophages. Importantly, despite the up-regulation of apoE, ABCA1, and ABCG1, vascular inflammation and atherosclerotic lesion development could not be prevented in SRBI-deficient mice challenged with an atherogenic diet.Fig. 6SRBI deficiency induces mRNA expression of inflammatory markers (a) and of genes involved in lipid homeostasis (b) in the aortic arch. mRNA levels of the indicated genes in aortae of SRBI+/+,"

We generated mice with disruptions in Nte, the gene encoding NTE. Nte(-/-) mice die after embryonic day 8, and Nte(+/-) mice have lower activity of Nte in the brain and higher mortality when exposed to the Nte-inhibiting compound ethyl octylphosphonofluoridate (EOPF) than do wild-type mice. Nte(+/-) and wild-type mice treated with 1 mg per kg of body weight of EOPF have elevated motor activity, showing that even minor reduction of Nte activity leads to hyperactivity. These studies show that genetic or chemical reduction of Nte activity results in a neurological phenotype of hyperactivity in mammals and indicate that EOPF toxicity occurs directly through inhibition of Nte without the requirement for Nte gain of function or aging."

Physiol. 1999; 61: 243-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). HSPs consist of a family of highly conserved proteins grouped according to their molecular size: the high molecular mass proteins (110, 90, 70–72, and 55–60 kDa) and the small HSPs, which include HSP27, ubiquitin, αA- and αB-crystallin, and related species. Although highly conserved across species, variation in protein size occurs; for example, the 27-kDa human HSP27 has a corresponding isoform of 25 kDa in rodents referred to as HSP25. HSPs are both constitutively expressed and induced in response to stressful stimuli (e.g. HSP27 and HSP70). Rapid induction of HSP expression is mediated by specific heat shock factors (heat shock factors 1–4), which regulate transcription (7Christians E.S. Yan L.J. Benjamin I.J. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S43-S50Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The HSPs play a key role in cellular defense systems, acting as protein chaperones facilitating protein folding and the removal of aberrant proteins. These properties have been shown to contribute to the enhanced cellular survival produced following preconditioning stimuli in which a subthreshold stimulus is used to raise endogenous heat shock protein levels prior to the main stimulus. Primary neuronal cultures are protected by prior exposure to mild heat or ischemic stress before subsequent more severe heat or ischemic stress or exposure to glutamate (8Lowenstein D.H. Chan P.H.

Brand N.J. Yellon D.M. Latchman D.S. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1996; 91: 79-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of heat shock can be mimicked by overexpression of HSPs alone. Both the ND7 immortalized neuronal cell line, which is derived from dorsal root ganglia neurons, and primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion neurons can be protected against subsequent ischemic or thermal stress by overexpression of HSP70 (12Uney J.B.

In cardiac cells or primary cultures of cardiac cells, overexpression of HSP70 protects against subsequent thermal or ischemic stress (16Mestril R. Chi S.H. Sayen M.R. O'Reilly K. Dillmann W.H. J.

Marked differences are seen for each HSP in their tissue and cellular specificity and their response to different insults. For example, seizure activity is associated with a rapid HSP70 induction in hippocampal neuronal populations, whereas HSP27 induction is primarily in glial cells and of longer duration (19Akbar M.T. Wells D.J. Latchman D.S. de Belleroche J. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 93: 148-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similarly, whereas prior heat shock protects ND7 neuronal cells and primary neurons against apoptosis due to withdrawal of serum or neural growth factor (13Mailhos C. Howard M.K. Latchman D.S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1787-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Mailhos C. Howard M.K. Latchman D.S. Neuroscience. 1993; 55: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), overexpression of HSP70 or HSP90 is not protective. Overexpression of HSP27 in ND7 neuronal cell lines does, however, protect not only against subsequent exposure to heat shock and simulated ischemia but most importantly to stimulation of apoptosis by serum withdrawal in the presence of all-trans-retinoic acid (21Wagstaff M.J.

Similarly, in primary dorsal root ganglion cells, infection with herpes simplex virus vectors expressing HSP27 or HSP70 protects against heat shock and simulated ischemia, whereas only expression of HSP27 protects against apoptosis induced by neural growth factor withdrawal (21Wagstaff M.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HSP27 in cardiac myocytes using an adenovirus vector also protects against simulated ischemia (24Martin J.L. Mestril R. Hilal-Dandan R. Brunton L.L. Dillmann W.H. Circulation. 1997; 96: 4343-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Infection of neonatal cardiac cells using an HSP27-expressing herpes simplex virus vector not only protects cells against heat shock and ischemia but also minimizes the extent of apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal or treatment with ceramide (25Brar B.K.

Through our previous studies, we were thus able to show that transfection with HSP27 conferred protection against apoptosis in neuronal cells, which was not evident with HSP70, although both HSPs were protective against heat shock and hypoxia. This finding prompted us to develop transgenic mouse lines overexpressing the human HSP27 (hHSP27) gene in order to determine whether evidence could be obtained in vivo for protection against apoptotic and ischemic insults in CNS. No such transgenic mouse has been previously reported for HSP27, although transgenic mice overexpressing HSP70 have been generated. Studies of cerebral ischemia using HSP70 transgenic lines have not yielded consistent results; whereas some authors have shown reduced cerebral infarcts (26Rajdev S. Hara K. Kokubo Y. Mestril R. Dillmann W. Weinstein P.R. Sharp F.R. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 782-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), others do not show reduced infarct size following permanent cerebral focal ischemia (27Lee J.E. Yenari M.A. Sun G.H. Xu L. Emond M.R. Cheng D. Steinberg G.K. Giffard R.G. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 170: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This may be due to background strain differences and/or differences in expression levels, since different promoters were used in these studies (28Yenari M.A. Giffard R.G. Sapolsky R.M. Steinberg G.K. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 525-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In order to carry out further elucidation of the neuroprotective properties of HSP27 and to determine whether in vivo protection can be demonstrated by HSP27, we generated transgenic mouse lines in which wild-type hHSP27 was expressed at high levels in cardiac and CNS tissue. Three independent lines were generated in order to confirm that protective effects could be replicated and to ensure that the effect was due to the HSP itself rather than due to the particular site of integration. These independent transgenic lines were then tested in the CNS using the in vivo administration of kainic acid to induce seizures and hippocampal cell death. All transgenic lines showed abundant hHSP27 expression throughout the brain, with particularly high expression levels in all hippocampal subfields. The kainic acid model is a well established experimental model of temporal lobe epilepsy in which systemic kainic acid results in sustained seizures followed by a selective pattern of neuronal damage in vulnerable limbic structures, most notably the CA3 region of hippocampus (29Ben-Ari Y. Neuroscience. 1985; 14: 375-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar, 30Schwob J.E. Fuller T. Price J.L. Olney J.W. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 991-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Although the mode of cell death includes both apoptotic and necrotic components, it provides a useful model to induce apoptotic cell death in vivo (31Pollard H. Charriaut-Marlangue C. Cantagrel S. Represa A. Robain O. Moreau J. Ben-Ari Y. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 32Bengzon J. Kokaia Z. Elmér E. Nanobashvili A. Kokaia M. Lindvall O. Proc. Natl.

The results obtained show that HSP27 plays an important role in CNS neuroprotection, as predicted from earlier cell culture studies, and in addition provide a preliminary insight into the site of action of HSP27 in vivo in the cell death cascade through its effects on caspase 3 induction. Establishment of Transgenic Mouse Lines Expressing Human HSP27—Transgenic mice were created using a transgene containing human HSP27 cDNA with a chicken β-actin promotor and cytomegalovirus enhancer (pCAGGS) (35Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). In order to track expression of the transgene, a hemagglutinin (HA) tag was placed contiguous with the HSP27 cDNA sequence. The linearized transgene was microinjected into pronuclei of fertilized eggs from C57BL10 × CBA/Ca mice, which were subsequently transferred to pseudopregnant recipients. This procedure was carried out in the Imperial College Gene Targeting Unit. At 3–4 weeks after birth, a small tail biopsy was taken from pups, and genomic DNA screened for the integration of the transgene using PCR. Founders revealed by this screening were used to establish independent transgenic lines by breeding to wild-type F1 hybrid (C57BL10 × CBA/Ca) mice. Following successful transmission, a range of tissues were screened by Western blot and immunohistochemistry to confirm CNS and cardiac expression. Overexpression of human HSP27 did not appear to produce any obvious effects on development or survival in mice from all three lines generated. Histological comparisons of brain and cardiac tissue from the different mouse lines revealed no observable morphological differences when compared with corresponding tissue from their respective wild-type littermates, although no detailed (quantitative) studies were carried out as a part of this study. Experimental Model of in Vivo Apoptosis Using Kainate—Mice were injected intraperitoneally with kainic acid (KA; Tocris) (20–30 mg/kg) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); 1 ml/kg). For dose-response studies, the following kainate doses were used with wild-type (WT) mice: 20 mg/kg, n = 18; 25 mg/kg, n = 39; 30 mg/kg, n = 4. A dose of 25 mg/kg was chosen for behavioral studies, since it produced the most consistent response (hHSP27(18), n = 35; WT, n = 39; hHSP27(64), n = 30; WT, n = 25). Animals were monitored continuously for 4 h for the onset and extent of seizure activity. The seizures were scored using a modified scale devised by Racine (36Racine R.J. Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1972; 32: 281-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5813) Google Scholar): 1, behavioral arrest, staring spells; 2, head bobbing, gnawing; 3, unilateral forelimb clonus; 4, bilateral forelimb clonus; 5, severe seizures with loss of postural control; 6, seizure-induced death. Animal care and procedures carried out followed Home Office guidelines and an ethical review committee-approved protocol. For in situ hybridization studies, animals were killed at 24 h after KA or vehicle or were untreated. Brains were rapidly removed and frozen on dry ice. Sections were cut (10 μm) on a cryostat (Bright Instruments), thaw-mounted onto Superfrost slides (BDH), and stored at –80 °C until use. For histology and neuron counts, animals were killed at 7 days after kainate injection (hHSP27(18), n = 6; WT, n = 6) or vehicle (hHSP27(18), n = 7; WT, n = 3), and brains were removed and processed as above. In Situ Hybridization—Specific antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized (Sigma-Genosys Ltd.) for use in the in situ hybridization studies. For detection of hemagglutinin tag mRNA, a 27-mer oligonucleotide, 5′-agcgtaatctggaacatcgtatgggta-3′ was used. For detection of human HSP27 mRNA, two probes (A and B) were used, which were based on the human HSP27 sequence (37Carper S.W. Rocheleau T.A. Storm F.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Probe A is a 33-mer oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 540–572, and probe B is a 33-mer oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 593–625. Both human HSP27 probes and the hemagglutinin tag probe yielded identical patterns of expression. For mouse HSP25 mRNA, three probes (probes 1, 2, and 3) were used, which are based on the mouse HSP25 sequence (38Frohli E. Aoyama A. Klemenz R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Probe 1 is a 34-mer oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 358–391, probe 2 is a 33-mer oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 497–529, and probe 3 is complementary to nucleotides 550–582. All three HSP25 probes yielded identical patterns of expression. For mouse glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA, a 45-mer oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 1119–1163 of the mouse GFAP gene (39Lewis S.A. Balcarek J.M. Krek V. Shelanski M. Cowan N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2743-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) was used. For detection of caspase 3 (mouse CPP32) mRNA, three probes (A, B, and C) were used, which were based on the mouse CPP32 gene sequence (40Juan T.S. McNiece I.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Fletcher F.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 749-755PubMed Google Scholar). Probe A is a 32-mer oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 577–608, probe B is a 31-mer oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 115–145, and probe C is a 32-mer oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 147–176. These probes gave similar distribution patterns. The data presented in this paper have been obtained using probe A. Oligonucleotide probes were 3′ end-labeled using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Promega) and [35S]dATP (Amersham Biosciences). Cryostat sections were processed, and in situ hybridization was carried out as previously described (19Akbar M.T. Wells D.J. Latchman D.S. de Belleroche J. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 93: 148-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (4 °C) for 10 min, rinsed in PBS for 2 × 5 min, and then treated with 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine, 0.9% NaCl for 10 min. Following dehydration in increasing concentrations of ethanol, the sections were delipidated in chloroform for 5 min, rinsed in ethanol, and allowed to air-dry. Sections were then hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 1–2 × 106 cpm of labeled probe in 100 μl of hybridization buffer (5× Denhardt's solution (0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Ficoll, and 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone), 4× standard saline citrate (SSC), 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 200 μg/ml polyadenylic acid, 200 μg/ml sheared single-stranded salmon sperm DNA, 50 mm phosphate buffer, and 20 mm dithiothreitol). The following day, sections were stringently washed (1× SSC at room temperature for 30 min, 1× SSC at 55 °C for 30 min, 0.5× SSC at 55 °C for 30 min, 0.1× SSC at 55 °C for 30 min, and 0.1× SSC at room temperature), dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanols, and air-dried. When dry, sections were exposed to x-ray film (BioMax MR; Eastman Kodak Co.) for 7–14 days and developed. Sections were then dipped in photographic emulsion (Ilford K5) and exposed for 1–6 weeks at 4 °C, developed, and counterstained with toluidine blue for light microscopic analyses. Semiquantitative Analysis of Caspase 3 mRNA—The semiquantitative analysis of signal intensity in the CA3 region of the hippocampus was carried out by assigning a score in the range of 0–3 (0 = no signal, 1 = low signal, 2 = moderate signal, and 3 = maximum signal intensity obtained). All sections were hybridized, exposed to autoradiographic film, and developed together in the same experiment. Scoring of sections was carried out by three observers without knowledge of the treatment. There was good agreement of scores, and where differences occurred, a mean of scores was taken. Group scores were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test (InStat version 2.01). Analysis of Neuronal Cell Density in Hippocampus—Serial coronal sections of the brain were cut at 10 μm, stained with hematoxylin-eosin, dehydrated through a series of alcohols, cleared in xylene, and cover-slipped. Histological analysis of cell morphology and cell counts in the hippocampus were confined to approximately –1.94 to –2.46 mm posterior to bregma (41Paxinos G. Franklin K.B.J. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London, UK2001Google Scholar). The Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope used for this study was equipped with a motor-driven stage to traverse the x and y axes. To define the boundaries of the hippocampus, slides were viewed with a ×10 objective. The entire hippocampus was then captured by a JVC 3-CCD color video camera, and the image was tiled onto a color monitor screen. A geometrical area of interest (0.036 mm2) was placed in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. This procedure was standardized in order to sample the same areas of these regions. Digital images were analyzed by the Image-Pro Plus 4.1 program (Data Cell). Morphological criteria of the normal pyramidal cells were established in the control mice based on size (length) and cellular staining. To prevent counting glial cells and degenerating neurons, all counting was thresholded at a minimal cell length of 0.009 pixels. The mean neuron count was obtained from three sections per animal. Cell counts were averaged, and neuronal cell density was expressed in terms of morphologically normal nuclei per square field of 0.036 mm2. Differences in neuronal cell densities between all of the treatment groups were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric analysis of variance test followed by Mann-Whitney U test (InStat version 2.01). Western Blot Analysis—Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and protein was extracted directly by homogenization in SDS sample buffer containing 10% SDS and a mixture of protease inhibitors. When quantification of protein concentration was required, the samples were homogenized in reporter gene assay lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science) plus protease inhibitors to give a final protein concentration of 100 mg/ml based on tissue wet weight. Protein concentration was determined using the detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). For protein gels, 100 μg of total protein was then further solubilized in 20 μl of 10% SDS sample buffer for each gel track. Proteins were separated on 10–20% acrylamide gradient Tris-glycine gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 100 V. Membranes were then air-dried. The efficiency of protein transfer was assessed by staining the membrane with 1% Amido Black in 10% methanol plus 10% acetic acid, destaining, and washing in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). Nonspecific binding was blocked using a 5% solution of dried milk powder (Marvel) in TBST. Western blot analysis was carried out using an antibody directed against the HA tag at 1:500 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), blotting grade anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) at 1:10,000, and detection with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) using blue light-sensitive x-ray film. Three 5-min washes with TBST were performed between each antibody step. Immunocytochemistry—Brain and heart samples were mounted on cork discs using Cryo-M-Bed (Bright) and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. 10-μm cryosections were cut, mounted on glass slides, air-dried and stored at –70 °C. Prior to staining sections were air-dried and fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 4% formalin. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by treating sections with 3% hydrogen peroxidase solution for 10 min followed by blocking for endogenous biotin using the avidin/biotin block as per the manufacturer's instructions (Dako). Nonspecific binding was blocked using 3% Marvel in TBST for 30 min followed by antibodies to either hHSP27 at 1:1000 (Stressgen) or the HA tag at 1:100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min. Biotinylated anti-rabbit at 1:500 (Dako) was then followed by a streptavidin ABC-horseradish peroxidase complex (Dako) for 30 min each and visualization with hydrogen peroxide activated DAB. Three 5-min washes in TBST were carried out between each step. Tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through graded alcohols, cleared with xylene, and mounted in DPX mountant (distrene, plasticiser, xylene). Statistical Analysis—Seizure score data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test. Fisher's exact test was used to compare mortality rates. Significance level was set at 0.05 for all comparisons. Establishment of Transgenic Mouse Lines Expressing Human HSP27—Three independent lines (lines 18, 59, and 64) of transgenic mice with similar patterns of expression of the human HSP27 transgene were generated. All three lines showed widespread expression in brain, spinal cord, heart, muscle, liver, kidney, lung, and pancreas. A similar high level of expression is shown in the brain for all three lines (Fig. 1A) by Western blot analysis, where equal amounts of protein were loaded and blots were probed with an antibody to the HA tag (Fig. 1A) or hHSP27 (data not shown). The widespread distribution of hHSP27 expression is shown for multiple tissues in Fig. 1B for hHSP27(18). A similar distribution was shown for hHSP27(59) and hHSP27(64) (data not shown). Antibodies to hHSP27 yielded identical results to antibodies directed to the HA tag on these Western blots (data not shown). All transgenic lines showed normal reproductive patterns and longevity, and behavior was not noticeably different from wild-type littermates. Transgene Expression in Brain—Immunocytochemistry was carried out on the three independent mouse lines expressing the transgene using the same two antibodies. Using the HA tag antibody, labeled neuronal cell bodies were detected throughout the brain, being particularly abundant in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, striatum, thalamus, and subventricular nuclei. Extensive labeling of fibrous networks and small cells was also seen, suggesting expression in glial cells. A similar distribution of expression of hHSP27 was seen for all three mouse lines (lines 18, 59, and 64). In CA1, CA3, and the hilus, cell bodies and their projections were strongly labeled, and extensive axonal and dendritic labeling was also seen in CA1 and CA3. This is shown for all 3 lines 18, 64, and 59 (Fig. 2, only shown for lines 18 and 64). In the dentate gyrus, transgene expression occurred in granule cells as well as the interneurons lining the internal surface of the granule cell layer, which were labeled using a GAD67 antibody in adjacent sections (data not shown). Distribution of Expression of hHSP27 Transgene mRNA in Brain—The expression of the hHSP27 transgene in the three mouse lines showing CNS expression of HSP27 protein from Western blot and immunohistochemistry was also characterized by in situ hybridization. Two HSP27 oligonucleotide probes (probes A and B) directed against the human sequence and not reactive with mouse (37Carper S.W. Rocheleau T.A. Storm F.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were tested together with a probe for the HA tag sequence, which was contiguous with the HSP27 transgene. All three probes produced identical RNase A-sensitive patterns of expression in brain sections from unstressed hHSP27(18) mice, whereas no signal was detected in sections from unstressed and kainate-stressed wild-type mice (HSP27-probe B, data shown in Fig. 3, A–D; HSP27-probe A and HA tag probe, data not shown). Probe B was used for further characterization of CNS expression of the HSP27 transgene. To validate further the specificity of these probes for the HSP27 transgene, three additional probes (probes 1–3) directed to the endogenous inducible mouse HSP25 gene (38Frohli E. Aoyama A. Klemenz R. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were synthesized. All three probes (1, 2, and 3) yielded id"
https://openalex.org/W1978325223,"For many protein multimers, association and dissociation reactions fail to reach the same end point; there is hysteresis preventing one and/or the other reaction from equilibrating. We have studied <i>in vitro</i> assembly of dimeric hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid protein and dissociation of the resulting T=4 icosahedral capsids. Empty HBV capsids composed of 120 capsid protein dimers were more resistant to dissociation by dilution or denaturants than anticipated from assembly experiments. Using intrinsic fluorescence, circular dichroism, and size exclusion chromatography, we showed that denaturants dissociate the HBV capsids without unfolding the capsid protein; unfolding of dimer only occurred at higher denaturant concentrations. The apparent energy of interaction between dimers measured in dissociation experiments was much stronger than when measured in assembly studies. Unlike assembly, capsid dissociation did not have the concentration dependence expected for a 120-subunit complex; consequently the apparent association energy systematically varied with reactant concentration. These data are evidence of hysteresis for HBV capsid dissociation. Simulations of capsid assembly and dissociation reactions recapitulate and provide an explanation for the observed behavior; these results are also applicable to oligomeric and multidomain proteins. In our calculations, we find that dissociation is impeded by temporally elevated concentrations of intermediates; this has the paradoxical effect of favoring re-assembly of those intermediates despite the global trend toward dissociation. Hysteresis masks all but the most dramatic decreases in contact energy. In contrast, assembly reactions rapidly approach equilibrium. These results provide the first rigorous explanation of how virus capsids can remain intact under extreme conditions but are still capable of ""breathing."" A biological implication of enhanced stability is that a triggering event may be required to initiate virus uncoating."

Here, modulating the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway rescued retinal degeneration in Drosophila mutants. Targeted expression of Drosophila neutral ceramidase rescued retinal degeneration in arrestin and phospholipase C mutants. Decreasing flux through the de novo sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway also suppressed degeneration in these mutants. Both genetic backgrounds modulated the endocytic machinery because they suppressed defects in a dynamin mutant. Suppression of degeneration in arrestin mutant flies expressing ceramidase correlated with a decrease in ceramide levels. Thus, enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism may be suitable targets in the therapeutic management of retinal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2123592143,"Tristetraprolin (TTP) and its two known mammalian family members are tandem CCCH zinc finger proteins that can bind to AU-rich elements (AREs) in cellular mRNAs and destabilize those transcripts, apparently by initiating their deadenylation. Previous studies have shown that the ∼70-amino acid tandem zinc finger domain of TTP is required and sufficient for RNA binding, and that the integrity of both zinc fingers is also required. However, little is known about the kinetics or structure of the peptide-RNA interaction, in part because of difficulties in obtaining soluble recombinant protein or peptides. We characterized the binding of a synthetic 73-amino acid peptide from human TTP to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ARE by gel mobility shift analyses and fluorescence anisotropy experiments. Both types of studies yielded a peptide-RNA dissociation constant of ∼10 nM. Surprisingly, we found that the “footprint” from the TNF ARE required for peptide binding was only ∼9 bases and that two molecules of peptide could bind to probes containing as little as 19 bases. An identical recombinant peptide exhibited gel shift characteristics similar to those of the synthetic peptide. NMR analysis of the 15N-labeled recombinant peptide suggested that its first zinc finger was structured in solution but that the second was not. The titration of oligonucleotides representing 17, 13, and even 9 bases of the TNF ARE caused an essentially identical, dramatic shift of existing resonances, and the appearance of new resonances in the peptide spectra, so that all amino acids could be assigned.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 30: 945-952Crossref Google Scholar for recent review). In mammals, there are three known members of this protein family, whereas fish and frogs express a fourth member that seems to consist of a group of closely related proteins (2De J. Lai W.S.

The characteristic tandem zinc finger domain of these proteins consists of two zinc fingers with 18 amino acids between fingers, strict intrafinger spacing of Cx8Cx5Cx3H, and a characteristic sequence motif leading into each finger of R(K)YKTEL or a closely related variant. Studies in TTP knockout mice and cells derived from them revealed that TTP acts in normal physiology to regulate the synthesis and secretion of two clinically important cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (5Taylor G.A.

The increased secretion of these cytokines in the TTP knockout mice was secondary to increased steady state levels of their mRNAs, which in turn was caused by excessive stabilization of the transcripts. TTP was found to confer instability on these two transcripts by binding to the so-called class II AREs contained within the 3′-untranslated regions of these mRNAs (7Carballo E. Lai W.S.

The tandem zinc finger domain was found to be the RNA binding domain, and the invariant cysteine and histidine residues in both fingers were required for mRNA binding. Thus, TTP seems to act in normal physiology to bind to and promote the destruction of the labile transcripts for TNF and GM-CSF. Subsequent studies have suggested that TTP in some way promotes the earliest step in mRNA turnover in mammalian cells, removal of the poly(A) tail, or deadenylation. Studies in bone marrow-derived stromal cells from TTP-deficient mice established that deadenylation of GM-CSF mRNA was defective in those cells (8Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the marked stabilization of the fully polyadenylated GM-CSF transcripts. These data represented strong evidence that TTP exerted its destabilizing effect on ARE-containing mRNAs by first binding to the ARE and then promoting deadenylation; the deadenylated mRNA body would then decay by other mechanisms. The two other known mammalian members of the TTP protein family, ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2, can exert TTP-like effects on mRNA stability in transfection studies in intact cells (13Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem.,. 2000; 275: 17827-19837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and promote removal of the poly(A) tail in a cell-free deadenylation assay (14Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3798-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar); however, their actual roles in physiology, and the identities of their physiological targets, are not known. Relatively little is known about the protein-RNA complex that forms the core of the interaction of TTP and related proteins to the ARE within the mRNA. We found that an epitope-tagged peptide containing 77 amino acids from the human TTP TZF domain could interact with ARE-containing RNA probes after expression in 293 cells (11Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that the core TZF domain was sufficient for RNA binding and encouraged us to plan studies aimed at ultimately determining the structure of this RNA-peptide complex. However, these studies have been frustrated to date by difficulties in obtaining recombinant TTP TZF peptide in soluble form. To circumvent these difficulties, and to determine some of the biochemical characteristics of the TZF domain interaction with a class II ARE, we designed and synthesized a 73-amino acid peptide that can bind to ARE-containing RNA probes with high affinity, as determined by several types of assay. Its binding “footprint” on the RNA seems to be only about nine residues, permitting the binding of more than one peptide to longer probes. Heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) analysis of an identical recombinant peptide revealed that the first zinc finger was structured in solution, whereas the second was not. Remarkably, titration of ARE oligonucleotides of 17, 13, and even 9 bases caused a dramatic shift in the HSQC spectrum of the peptide, suggesting that a profound conformational change occurred upon RNA binding. This apparent change in conformation was accompanied by the apparent structuring of the residues in the second zinc finger, so that every position in the peptide could be assigned in the presence of RNA. These data suggest that this peptide or a similar variant may be suitable for the ultimate structure determination of the TZF domain-RNA complex. Synthetic TZF Domain Peptide—A 73-amino acid peptide comprising the human TTP TZF domain was synthesized that contained the 58 amino acids of the “core” TZF domain (from the initial C of the first zinc finger to the final H of the second zinc finger); it also contained seven amino acids of the highly conserved amino-terminal lead-in sequence, and eight additional amino acids at the carboxyl terminus that were predicted to improve solubility. This peptide corresponds to residues 102–174 of the GenBank RefSeq (reference protein sequence) NP_003398. The sequence of this peptide is: SRYKTELCRTFSESGRCRYGAKCQFAHGLGELRQANRHPKYKTELCHKFYLQGRCPYGSRCHFIHNPSEDLAA, with a theoretical average mass of 8510.6 Da and a theoretical pI of 9.35. This was synthesized and purified by standard methods (Albachem Ltd., Edinburgh, Scotland; see Refs. 15Ramage R. Green J. Muir T.W. Ogunjobi O.M. Love S. Shaw K. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Ramage R. Green J. Ogunjobi O.M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 2149-2152Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Analytical reverse phase HPLC showed that the peptide was more than 95% pure, with a molecular mass of 8508.00 Da as determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. After synthesis and preparative HPLC purification, the peptide, labeled TTP73, was refolded by standard procedures (Albachem), then lyophilized and stored at 0 °C or below. The lyophilized peptide was soluble at concentrations of up to 10 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, and 0.01 mm dithiothreitol. RNA Probes—Several types of RNA probes were used. For routine gel shift assays, 32P-labeled RNA probes were synthesized, purified, and labeled from the appropriate TNF plasmid as described previously (10Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Briefly, probe mTNF (1309–1332) consisted of 24 bases of the mouse TNF core ARE, representing bp 1309–1332 of GenBank accession number X02611, 3′ of 58 bases consisting of bases +1 to the EcoRV site of the T7 transcription product from the vector SK– (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Probe mTNF(1281–1350) consisted of 70 bases from the mouse TNF ARE, representing bases 1281–1350 of GenBank accession number X02611, 3′ of 29 bases representing bases +1 to the BamHI site of the T7 transcription product of the vector BS+ (Stratagene). Probe ARE-A50 was described in detail previously (14Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3798-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, it consisted of a 5′ sequence of 58 ribonucleotides transcribed from the multiple cloning sites of vector SK– (Stratagene) followed by 24 bases of the core ARE from the mouse TNF mRNA (bp 1309–1332 of GenBank accession number X02611), followed by 50 A residues; the 3′ end of the RNA did not contain any non-A ribonucleotides. Various mutants of the 24-base core ARE in ARE-A50 were constructed by substituting the wild-type ARE sequence with double-stranded 24-base DNA oligonucleotides containing the mutated base-pairs: the wild-type ARE sequence was TTATTTATTTATTATTTATTTATT in probe ARE-A50; it was TTCTTTCTTTCTTCTTTCTTTCTT in probe ARE(6C)-A50; it was TTATTTATTTATTCTTTCTTTATT in probe ARE(3A2CA)-A50; it was TTATTTATTTCTTCTTTATTTATT in probe ARE(2A2C2A)-A50; it was TTATTTATTTATTATTTCTTTCTT in probe ARE(4A2C)-A50; it was TTATTTATTTCTTCTTTCTTTATT in probe ARE(2A3CA)-A50; and it was TTATTTCTTTCTTATTTCTTTATT in probe ARE(A2CACA)-A50. All probes were capped during synthesis as described previously (14Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3798-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For the fluorescence anisotropy experiments, synthetic RNA probes were purchased from and purified by Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). A TNF ARE 20-mer RNA oligonucleotide was used that was labeled with fluorescein at the 5′-end: 5′-UUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAG-3′. The first 19 bases correspond to bp 1348–1366 of GenBank accession number NM_000594.2 (human TNF mRNA), with the last base not from the TNF sequence. A longer TNF ARE probe (38-mer) was also used, consisting of 37 bases from the TNF core ARE, corresponding to bp 1330–1366 of GenBank accession number NM_000594.2: 5′-GUGAUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUAUUUAUUUAUUUAG-3′. The last base was not from the TNF sequence. A control 31-mer fluorescent probe (Rβ) was also used, corresponding to bp 1240–1270 of the rabbit β-globin cDNA (GenBank accession number J00660.1); this was also labeled at the 5′-end: 5′-UGGCCAAUGCCCUGGCUCACAAUACCACUG-3′ Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Preliminary studies revealed that the peptide was readily soluble in buffers containing low concentrations of dithiothreitol and ZnCl2. Gel shift assays using this peptide were performed as described previously (10Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Anisotropy—These assays were performed essentially as described previously (17Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K.Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), except that the TTP73 peptide was incubated in binding buffer containing ZnCl2 (5 μm) for 30 min before both the anisotropy measurements and the gel shift assays. The mathematical analysis of the anisotropy data was performed as described previously (17Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K.Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Preliminary testing of probes by 32P labeling and gel shift analysis were performed as described previously (18Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Bolikal S. Chuang K.Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44450-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The solution binding affinity of TTP73 for fluorescein-labeled RNA substrates was analyzed by steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, measured using the Beacon 2000 variable temperature fluorescence polarization system (Panvera, Madison, WI) equipped with fluorescein excitation (λex, 490 nm) and emission (λem, 535 nm) filters. Binding reactions were assembled essentially as described previously (18Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Bolikal S. Chuang K.Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44450-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), except that ZnCl2 (5 μm) was added to protein samples 30 min before the anisotropy measurements. Because TTP73 binding did not alter the fluorescence quantum yield of the labeled RNA substrates (Fig. 5B), total anisotropy (At) was interpreted based on direct fractional contributions from each fluorescing species (bound versus free RNA) as described previously (17Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K.Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum, New York1999: 291-319Crossref Google Scholar). Binding affinity was calculated by measuring total anisotropy (At) across a range of protein (P) concentrations (n > 30), then resolving these data using a variant of the Hill model, given by Equation 1 (18Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Bolikal S. Chuang K.Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44450-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar),At=AR+APRK[P]nH1+K[P]nH (Eq. 1) where K is the equilibrium association constant (= 1/Kd), nH is the Hill coefficient, and AR and APR represent the intrinsic anisotropy values of the free and protein-associated fluorescein-labeled RNA substrates, respectively. Although individual binding steps in oligomerization mechanisms cannot be defined by this algorithm (20Wilson G.M. Sun Y. Lu H. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33374-33381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it will detect significant deviation from a single-site binding model (i.e. nH = 1). AR was defined by the anisotropy of RNA substrates measured in the absence of TTP73 (n ≥ 3), whereas all other constants were solved by non-linear least squares regression using Prism v.2.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Expression and Purification of Biosynthetic TTP73—The TZF domain of human TTP (residues 102–174 of GenBank accession number NP_003398.1) was cloned into the pET30a(+) vector (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) between the NdeI and BamHI sites. The encoded sequence was identical to that of peptide TTP73; no purification tags were used, and no mutant amino acids were inserted into the sequence. The expression vector was transformed into BL21(DE3)STAR competent cells (Invitrogen) containing an isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside-inducible T7 RNA polymerase gene. The transformed cells were grown in LB and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside and 100 μm ZnSO4 (final concentration) when the A600 reached 0.7. The induced cells were allowed to grow for an additional period of 3 h at 37 °C and then were harvested by centrifugation. Harvested cells were lysed by passing them through a French pressure cell three times in a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and then clarified by centrifugation (70,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C). In a typical preparation, 30 ml of the clear supernatant containing the TTP peptide was allowed to flow through a 10-ml DEAE column that had previously been equilibrated with a buffer containing 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0. The flow-through from this column was concentrated to ∼10 ml and exchanged into a buffer consisting of 25 mm phosphate, pH 6.5, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol by ultrafiltration. This solution was then subjected to cation-exchange chromatography on a Source 15S column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. The peptide was eluted with a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m; the peak elution of the peptide was at 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing the peptide were combined, concentrated to 1.8 ml by using a 3-kDa Centriprep (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA), and then further purified by using size-exclusion chromatography using a 1.6 × 60-cm Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) that had previously been equilibrated in a buffer consisting of 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. The final preparation of peptide was > 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining; it was also soluble in the gel filtration buffer described above. For NMR analysis, 15N- or 15N/13C-labeled TTP (102–174) was expressed in M9 minimal medium containing 1.0 g/liter [15N]NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) and 2.0 g/liter unlabeled or [13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, and purified as described above. The purified TTP was exchanged into a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% (v/v) D2O for NMR analysis. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were recorded at 25 °Con a Varian Inova 600-MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple-resonance probe and a shielded Z-gradient unit. Spectra were processed using Felix (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) and analyzed with XEASY (21Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR,. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). HNCACB (22Wittekind M. Mueller L. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1993; 101: 201-205Crossref Scopus (854) Google Scholar) and CBCA(CO)NH (23Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6291-6293Crossref Scopus (928) Google Scholar) experiments were recorded for the sequential assignment of TTP (102–174). A series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra of [15N]TTP (102–174) and the various [15N]TTP(102–174)/RNA oligonucleotide complexes were recorded to study the TTP/ARE RNA interaction. RNA Oligonucleotides for NMR—RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon. Three oligonucleotides were used for NMR: a 17-mer, UUAUUUAUUUAUUAUUU, corresponding to bases 1341–1357 of human TNF mRNA (GenBank accession number NM_000594.2; also identical to a segment of the mouse TNF mRNA, GenBank accession number X02611.1, bases 1309–1325); a 13-mer derived from this 17-mer, UUAUUUAUUUAUU; and a 9-mer derived from this 13-mer, UUAUUUAUU. Gel Shift Analysis—Exposure of the TTP73 peptide (1 μM) to the 32P-labeled mTNF(1281–1350) probe resulted in the formation of three distinct complexes (Fig. 1A, complexes 1–3). Using a shorter RNA probe (mTNF (1309–1332)), consisting of 24 bases from the mouse TNF core ARE (bp 1309–1332 of GenBank accession number X02611), only complexes 1 and 2 were formed (Fig. 1B). These data suggested a model in which the synthetic peptide was occupying tandem binding sites on the ARE, three in the case of the longer probe, and two in the case of the 24-base probe. When the shorter probe (mTNF (1309–1332)) was incubated with peptide concentrations from 0.1 to 1 μM, the same two probe complexes were observed at all peptide concentrations tested (Fig. 2A); the two analogous complexes formed with full-length TTP expressed in 293 cells are also shown in Fig. 2A, lane 2). Complex 1 was detectable at peptide concentrations as low as 6 nM (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Filmless autoradiographic analysis of the data on lower band formation (Fig. 2B, complex 1) indicated that half-maximal binding took place at ∼8 nM peptide under these conditions. Formation of complex 2 seemed to occur at somewhat higher peptide concentrations. When the amount of radioactivity shifted by both complexes was combined, half-maximal accumulation occurred at ∼30 nM peptide. A similar result was obtained when the loss of probe from its original location was measured. Because mutation of a single key amino acid in either zinc finger abrogates binding of full-length TTP to an ARE probe (13Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem.,. 2000; 275: 17827-19837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), this binding competence of TTP73 indicates that both zinc fingers were adequately folded to permit high-affinity binding. The data also support the concept of two TTP binding sites on the 24-base ARE probe, suggesting that the footprint of peptide TTP73 was less than 24 bases. To explore this in greater detail, a series of probes was constructed in which one or more of the A residues within the 24-base ARE were mutated to C residues. Previous studies had indicated that replacement of all six As in this probe with either C or G completely prevented TTP binding (11Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). 2W. S. Lai and P. J. Blackshear, unpublished data. Binding of these probes to TTP73 is shown in Fig. 3. Binding of the wild-type ARE-A50 probe (0.1 μM) (Fig. 3, probe 1) to the TTP73 peptide resulted in the formation of an upper complex (complex 2) that contained substantially less radioactivity than the lower complex (complex 1) (Fig. 3, first lane). However, when 0.5 μM peptide was used, the amount of radioactivity in complex 2 increased markedly, and all of the probe was shifted into the gel (Fig. 3, third lane). The migration position of the probe alone is shown in the second lane (Fig. 3). When probes 2, 3, and 5 were used with the higher peptide concentration (0.5 μM), only complex 1 was formed (Fig. 3), even when the film was relatively overexposed as in Fig. 3. This suggested that binding could occur with the small footprint afforded by the 5′ half of probe 3, i.e. UUAUUUAUUU. That only a single complex was formed with these probes suggested that the single A footprint (i.e. UUUAUU) found at the 3′-end of probes 3 and 5 was not sufficient for complex formation. A smaller proportion of probe 3 seemed to be shifted into the gel to form complex 1 than was found with probes 2 and 5 under these conditions, suggesting that the footprints provided by probes 2 and 5 were similar in binding affinity, whereas the footprint provided by probe 3 was of somewhat lower affinity. When the wild-type probe sequence was changed to include two C residues in the middle (probe 4), both complexes were formed, as seen with the wild-type probe 1. Thus, both the UUAUUUAUUU and UUUAUUUAUU 10-base footprints supported peptide binding, and these two footprints, separated by the mutant C-containing sequence, were still adequate to support binding of 2 mol of peptide/mol of probe. This supports a model for the formation of complexes 1 and 2 with the wild-type ARE-A50 probe in which two molecules of peptide are aligned in tandem on a single RNA probe. As shown previously for intact TTP, there was no detectable binding of the TTP73 peptide to probe 7 (Fig. 3, last lane), in which all six A residues of the 24-base ARE were replaced with C residues. There was also no detectable binding to probe 6 under these conditions (Fig. 3, penultimate lane), indicating that the 6-base footprints UUAUUU (repeated once) and UUUAUU were not adequate for peptide binding. Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—First, we tested whether the peptide could bind to the synthetic ARE probes that would be used in these studies. Under different assay conditions (17Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K.Y. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the TTP73 peptide slowed the migration of the 38-mer probe, and resulted in the formation of three major complexes (Fig. 4A, complexes 1–3). Higher peptide concentrations led to progressively greater appearance of complexes 2 and 3 (Fig. 4A). When the shorter 20-mer probe was used, which contained 19 base from the core TNF ARE, a single major complex was formed (Fig. 4B, complex 1), although at considerably higher peptide concentrations, a small amount of complex 2 could be detected (Fig. 4B). Under these assay conditions, half-maximal binding of the probe occurred at ∼2 nM (Fig. 4B). No binding of the peptide to the control probe Rβ was seen, even at concentrations as high as 2 μM (Fig. 4C). To determine binding affinity of TTP73 more quantitatively, we then performed fluorescence anisotropy assays at equilibrium using the same peptide concentrations and the 20-mer oligonucleotide (Fig. 5). In these experiments, solution equilibrium was attained very rapidly (< 15 s). As shown in Fig. 5A, there was no apparent change in fluorescence intensity with different TTP73 concentrations, indicating that the fluorescence quantum yield was not affected by peptide binding. In contrast, anisotropy of the fluorescent 20-mer ARE substrate was dramatically enhanced by the TTP73 peptide (Fig. 5B), and was well described by the Hill model (solid line). The peptide-probe binding occurred with no apparent cooperativity, with a Hill coefficient of 0.92 ± 0.05 (mean ± the standard error of regression, defined as one-half of the 95% confidence intervals for each constant). These values are based on data from single experiments containing 40 independent binding reactions; however, duplicate experiments yielded sim"

In the absence of PEN-2, Notch signaling fails to guide normal development in Caenorhabditis elegans, and amyloid β peptide is not generated from the amyloid precursor protein. Human PEN-2 is a 101-amino acid protein containing two putative transmembrane domains. To understand its interaction with other γ-secretase components, it is important to know the membrane topology of each member of the complex. To characterize the membrane topology of PEN-2, we introduced single amino acid changes in each of the three hydrophilic regions of PEN-2 to generate N-linked glycosylation sites. We found that the N-linked glycosylation sites present in the N- and C-terminal domains of PEN-2 were utilized, whereas a site in the hydrophilic “loop” region connecting the two transmembrane domains was not. The addition of a carbohydrate structure in the N-terminal domain of PEN-2 prevented association with presenilin 1, whereas glycosylation in the C-terminal region of PEN-2 did not, suggesting that the N-terminal domain is important for interactions with presenilin 1. Immunofluorescence microscopy with selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane of cells expressing epitope-tagged forms of PEN-2 confirmed the lumenal location of both the N and C termini. A protease protection assay also demonstrated that the loop domain of PEN-2 is cytosolic. Thus, PEN-2 spans the membrane twice, with the N and C termini facing the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.

This complex is responsible for intramembranous proteolytic cleavage of both the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the Notch receptor. APP, a type I integral membrane protein, is cleaved in its lumenal domain by the membrane-anchored aspartyl protease BACE (for β-site APP cleaving enzyme), resulting in a C-terminal 99-amino acid-long membrane-anchored fragment termed C99 (6Vassar R.

C99 can be subsequently cleaved within its transmembrane domain by the γ-secretase complex. This cleavage results in both the production of the amyloid β peptide (7Xia W. Ray W.J. Ostaszewski B.L.

The amyloid β peptide is prone to aggregation and is the main component of amyloid plaques, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (9Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G.

That the γ-secretase and APP are central to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis is clear as mutations in APP or the presenilins can result in autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (10Levy-Lahad E.

PS1 and its less abundant homolog PS2 are known to be necessary for γ-secretase activity and are likely the proteases that cleave APP and Notch (13Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S.

After synthesis, PS1 is itself cleaved resulting in noncovalently associated N- and C-terminal fragments that are thought to be the active form of the enzyme. However, the presenilins do not function alone, being known to associate with other proteins that are required for γ-secretase function. Nicastrin, a type I integral membrane protein, was the first protein other than the presenilins to be identified as a member of the γ-secretase complex (5Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D.

Furthermore, the various components of the complex appear to regulate each other and are required for normal maturation and trafficking of the other complex proteins. For example, in the absence of PS, Nct fails to become resistant to endoglycosidase H (endo H) and appears to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (17Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C.

Similarly, cleavage of PS1 into N- and C-terminal fragments does not occur following down-regulation of Nct or APH-1 and is reduced significantly following down-regulation of PEN-2 (15Francis R.

The topology of APH-1 is currently unknown. To advance the understanding of the interaction of these proteins, we investigated the membrane topology of PEN-2, a 101-amino acid-long protein with two potential transmembrane domains, using three independent and complementary approaches. Glycosylation-scanning mutagenesis, which takes advantage of the fact that secretory and membrane glycoproteins are glycosylated only on the lumenal side of the ER (25Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar), was employed to biochemically determine the regions of PEN-2 that are within the ER lumen. This strategy has been used successfully to determine the topologies of other proteins (26Chang X.B. Hou Y.X. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18572-18575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hamilton S.R. Yao S.Y. Ingram J.C. Hadden D.A. Ritzel M.W. Gallagher M.P. Henderson P.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8675-8679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, we used immunofluorescence to demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal domains of epitope-tagged PEN-2 were detectable only when the ER and Golgi membranes were permeabilized and not when the plasma membrane was selectively permeabilized. That the tagged and mutated PEN-2 proteins retained their original structure, and therefore topology, was confirmed by demonstrating that all PEN-2-tagged and mutant proteins we studied associated with PS1 as judged by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. To confirm the results from the glycosylation scanning and immunofluorescence approaches, a protease protection assay using selectively permeabilized cells was utilized to demonstrate that not only were the N- and C-terminal domains of PEN-2 lumenal but that the hydrophilic domain connecting the two hydrophobic, putative transmembrane domains was cytosolic. Finally, using the glycosylated PEN-2 mutant proteins as tools to study γ-secretase assembly, we found that glycosylation near the N terminus of PEN-2 disrupted the physical association between PEN-2 and PS1 and that PEN-2 likely associates with other γ-secretase complex components in the ER very shortly after its synthesis. Thus, the γ-secretase component PEN-2 spans the membrane two times and is oriented such that its N- and C-terminal domains are inserted into the lumen of the ER. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—APH-1a and PEN-2 were cloned from a liver cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using standard PCR methods (Expand high fidelity polymerase; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Primers were synthesized based on published sequences (forward, 5′-CACCATGAACCTGGAGCGAGTGTCC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGGGGTGCCCAGGGGTAT-3′), and the resulting PCR products were cloned into pcDNA3.1D-V5/HisTOPO (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocol.

Two methods were used to introduce site-directed nucleotide substitutions. PEN-2 E10S and PEN-2 A46N were created using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis using mismatched, overlapping PCR primers (E10S forward, 5′-CGAGTGTCCAATGAGtcGAAATTGAACCTG TGC-3′; E10S reverse, 5′-GCACAGGTTCAATTTCgaCTCATTGGACACTCG-3′; A46N forward, 5′-AGGCCTTCCTTGTCCCAaaCTACACAGAACAGAGCCA-3′; A46N reverse, 5′-TGGCTCTGTTCTGTGTAGttTGGGACAAGGAAGGCCT-3′). The PEN-2 S93N was created by introducing the glycosylation site using standard PCR in which the entire PEN-2 coding open reading frame was amplified with the forward primer described above and a reverse primer encoding the desired mutation (5′-TCAGGGGGTGCCCAGGGGTATGGTGAAGttGAGGTAGTCCCC-3′). The PCR product was purified and cloned into pcDNA3.1D-V5/HisTOPO. PEN-2 expression vectors encoding HA tags at either the 5′ or 3′ end of the open reading frame were constructed in a similar fashion. The 5′ HA tag was introduced in-frame by PCR using a forward primer that included the sequence for the HA epitope tag as an overhang at the 5′ end (5′-CACCATGTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTAACCTGGAGCGAGTGTCC-3′) with a reverse primer that added a stop codon after the PEN-2 coding sequence (5′-TCAG GGGGTGCCCAGGGGTAT-3′). The 3′ HA tag was similarly introduced using the forward primer described above and a reverse primer (5′-TCAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAGGGGGTGCCCAGGGGTAT-3′). The resulting PCR products were cloned as above. Plasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen plasmid kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The identity of all plasmids was confirmed by sequencing. Antibodies—HA-tagged PEN-2 and BACE proteins were labeled with mAb HA11 (Covance, Princeton, NJ). Calnexin was recognized using Calnexin H-70, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the lumenal N terminus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). PS1 was immunoprecipitated using affinity-purified PS1 “M” antibody, a rabbit polyclonal sera raised against the loop domain of PS1. This peptide was expressed as a His-tagged recombinant protein BL 21 E. coli and then injected into rabbits to generate the crude antisera before affinity purification. BACE-KK HA was blotted using “85,” a rabbit polyclonal raised against BACE holoprotein. Cell Culture and Western Blotting—Six-well plates of HEK293T, BHK-21, CHO, HeLa, or QT6 cells were transfected using Gene Porter lipid transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA). 24 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 (TX-100), 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then sonicated and cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Cell lysates from 200,000 cells were deglycosylated using peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or endoglycosidase H (endo H) (New England Biolabs, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Control samples were treated identically with H2O used in place of enzyme. The samples were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C before processing for SDS-PAGE. All samples were run on precast 10–20% Tris-HCl Chemicon gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and transferred to PVDF membranes. The antigens were detected by Western blot with the appropriate antibodies followed by imaging with an ECL+plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) or SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) on a Fujifilm (Stamford, CT) LAS-1000 camera. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with the BACE-HA, the PEN-2 N-terminal HA, the PEN-2 C-terminal HA, or the PEN-2 S93N plasmids using the Gene Porter transfection reagent. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS. To selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane of appropriate cells, 300 μl of activated streptolysin O (SLO) was placed on the cells at 200 units/ml for 5 min at 37 °C preceding fixation and then washed with PBS. The cells were fixed for 5 min in 2% formaldehyde and then rinsed in PBS. Complete permeabilization was obtained by incubating fixed cells with 0.1% Triton-X100 for 10 min at room temperature. All cells were blocked for 10 min in PBS supplemented with 4% fetal calf serum and then incubated with primary antibodies to HA (1:500) and calnexin (1:100) in 4% fetal calf serum for 1 h at room temperature. In the selective permeabilization experiments, HA-tagged PEN-2 and BACE constructs were detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody to HA11 (Covance). The lumenal N terminus of endogenous calnexin was detected using calnexin H-70. In the Golgi co-localization studies, the PEN-2 HA constructs were detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to HA11 (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), and GM130 was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody to GM130 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Cells were then incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500 each) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (1:1000) in 4% fetal calf serum. Secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 (goat anti-rabbit) and Alexa Fluor 594 (goat anti-mouse) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Following a final wash, the coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) and sealed with nail polish. Fluorescence was examined at 60× magnification with a Nikon E600 microscope utilizing UV illumination. Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK293T cells overexpressing PS1 and the appropriate PEN-2 plasmid (or green fluorescent protein) were grown to 80% confluency in 10-cm2 plates. Cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPSO, 1 mm EDTA, with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. All immunoprecipitation steps were performed at 4 °C. After pre-clearing with protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 20 min, the cell lysates were incubated with PS1 “M” antibody previously coupled to protein A/G plus agarose for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted at 100 °C for 5 min with 20 μl of sample buffer (0.08 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue). Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Protease Protection—HEK293T cells in six-well plates were transfected with calcium phosphate to overexpress the PEN-2 N-terminal HA, the PEN-2 C-terminal HA, or BACE-KK HA constructs. The next day, the cells were washed three times in PBS and then treated with 300 μl of trypsin-EDTA and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Upon resuspension, the cells were then selectively permeabilized by the addition 200 μl of PBS, 200 μl of SLO in PBS (1000 units/ml), or 200 μl of 0.2% TX-100 in PBS and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were then treated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C after which time proteinase K was inhibited by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1.0 mm). The cells were lysed by the addition of 120 μl of 5× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then sonicated and cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). PEN-2 samples were analyzed on 16.5% Tris-Tricine Chemicon gels (Bio-Rad) while BACE samples were run on 4–15% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was carried out as described above using anti-HA for PEN-2 and “85” for BACE. Glycosylation Scanning Mutagenesis—PEN-2 associates with PS1 and Nct, both of which are integral membrane proteins. It is effectively solubilized from cells with nonionic detergents, and it possesses two domains of the appropriate length and hydrophobicity to constitute transmembrane domain regions. However, it is also possible that only one of these putative domains actually spans the membrane. Therefore, there are four possible topological models for PEN-2 (Fig. 1A). To address the membrane topology of PEN-2 we took advantage of the absolute asymmetry of the N-linked glycosylation machinery, which adds core high mannose structures only on protein domains within the lumen of the ER. Because PEN-2 lacks N-linked glycosylation sites, we introduced single amino acid substitutions in each of the three hydrophilic domains of PEN-2 to generate Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) sequons (Fig. 1B). The three mutants were expressed using either N-terminal or C-terminal HA epitope tags, resulting in a total of six constructs. Each of the four possible membrane topologies of PEN-2 would result in a unique glycosylation pattern if the inserted sequons in the lumenal domains are utilized. Therefore, by examining the utilization of sequons in these PEN-2 mutant proteins, it would be possible to deduce its membrane topology. Each construct was expressed in HEK293T cells and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with a monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope tag. The E10S and S93N PEN-2 mutants were glycosylated with variable efficiency as demonstrated by the slower migration of the glycosylated mutant proteins in comparison to the wild type PEN-2 (Fig. 2). These constructs were also glycosylated when they were transiently expressed in HeLa, BHK-21, Chinese hamster ovary, and QT6 cells (data not shown). The A46N mutant was not glycosylated. The results were similar whether the epitope tag was at the N (Fig. 2A) or C (Fig. 2B) terminus, though the E10S mutant was glycosylated more efficiently in the context of the N-terminal epitope tag. These results make it unlikely that the epitope tags disrupt PEN-2 membrane topology. To confirm that the change in mobility was caused by N-linked glycosylation, cell lysates expressing PEN-2 or the E10S, A46N, or S93N mutants were treated with PNGase F, which removes N-linked oligosaccharides. After digestion, the E10S and S93N mutant proteins quantitatively migrated with wild type PEN-2 indicating the shift in migration was in fact because of glycosylation. Because N-linked oligosaccharides are added only on protein domains within the ER, these results provide clear biochemical evidence that the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of PEN-2 are inserted within the ER lumen (Fig. 3). Immunofluorescence with Selective Membrane Permeabilization—The biochemical data provided substantial evidence supporting a PEN-2 topology in which both the N- and C-terminal domains are inserted in the ER lumen. However it is possible, though unlikely, that the single amino acid substitutions introduced to generate N-linked glycosylation sites disrupted the normal membrane topology of wild type PEN-2. Therefore, it was necessary to confirm the proposed membrane topology of PEN-2 using an independent approach. To do so, we expressed both N- and C-terminally tagged PEN-2 in HeLa cells and performed immunofluorescent microscopy using a variety permeabilization conditions. If the N- and C-terminal domains of PEN-2 are within the ER lumen, then N- and C-terminally tagged PEN-2 proteins should only be detected if both the cell membrane and the ER/Golgi membranes are permeabilized using TX-100. In contrast, if the plasma membrane was selectively permeabilized using SLO, leaving the ER/Golgi membranes intact, the epitope-tagged proteins would not be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. To clearly demonstrate that the examined cells were appropriately permeabilized, several controls were used. We used an antibody to the lumenal domain of calnexin, a molecular chaperone present at high levels in the ER (31Bergeron J.J. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), to control for the integrity of the ER membrane. We also used an antibody directed against an epitope tag in the cytoplasmic domain of BACE-HA, a type I transmembrane protein. Therefore, selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane should result in the recognition of BACE by exogenously added antibody, whereas permeabilization of all cellular membranes would result in the detection of both BACE and calnexin. HeLa cells were transfected with BACE-HA, N-terminally tagged PEN-2, or C-terminally tagged PEN-2 and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. HeLa cells were treated with SLO to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane onl"
https://openalex.org/W2167875436,"PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domains are a family of sensor protein domains involved in signal transduction in a wide range of organisms. Recent structural studies have revealed that these domains contain a structurally conserved α/β-fold, whereas almost no conservation is observed at the amino acid sequence level. The photoactive yellow protein, a bacterial light sensor, has been proposed as the PAS structural prototype yet contains an N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif not found in other PAS domains. Here we describe the atomic resolution structure of a photoactive yellow protein deletion mutant lacking this motif, revealing that the PAS domain is indeed able to fold independently and is not affected by the removal of these residues. Computer simulations of currently known PAS domain structures reveal that these domains are not only structurally conserved but are also similar in their conformational flexibilities. The observed motions point to a possible common mechanism for communicating ligand binding/activation to downstream transducer proteins."

The synthesis and biological properties of several derivatives have been reported. The structural interactions of allosamidin with several family 18 chitinases have been determined by x-ray crystallography previously. Here, a high resolution structure of chitotriosidase, the human macrophage chitinase, in complex with allosamidin is presented. In addition, complexes of the allosamidin derivatives demethylallosamidin, methylallosamidin, and glucoallosamidin B are described, together with their inhibitory properties. Similar to other chitinases, inhibition of the human chitinase by allosamidin derivatives lacking a methyl group is 10-fold stronger, and smaller effects are observed for the methyl and C3 epimer derivatives. The structures explain the effects on inhibition in terms of altered hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, together with displaced water molecules. The data reported here represent a first step toward structure-based design of specific allosamidin derivatives.

Family 18 chitinases hydrolyze chitin, a polymer of β-(1,4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine. Chitin is not found in humans but plays a key role in the life cycles of several classes of human pathogens, such as fungi (1Kuranda M.J. Robbins P.W. J. Biol.

It consists of two N-acetylallosamine sugars, linked to a novel moiety termed allosamizoline, which contains a cyclopentitol group, coupled to an oxazoline that carries a dimethyl amine (Fig. 1 and Table I).

The inhibitor appears to bind from the -3 to -1 subsites, with the allosamizoline occupying the -1 subsite. Several hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions with aromatic residues appear to be responsible for the tight binding of allosamidin to the family 18 chitinases (19van Aalten D.M.F. Komander D.

Structure. 1994; 2: 1181-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Allosamidin is thought to resemble the structure of a reaction intermediate that is unique among the glycoside hydrolases (18Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Armand S. Kalk K.H. Isogai A. Henrissat B. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15619-15623Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Retaining glycoside hydrolases mostly function through a double displacement mechanism that involves a catalytic acid and a nucleophile and proceeds through a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate (such as shown recently (23Vocadlo D.J. Davies G.J. Laine R. Withers S.G. Nature. 2001; 412: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) for lysozyme). In family 18 chitinases, however, a suitable nucleophile is missing in the protein, and instead the reaction proceeds through nucleophilic attack of the N-acetyl group on the substrate itself, resulting in an oxazoline intermediate (18Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C.

It is this intermediate that is mimicked by allosamidin (Fig. 1). The inhibitor is hydrolytically stable, because it lacks the pyranose oxygen. Allosamidin is a broad-spectrum inhibitor, inhibiting all characterized family 18 chitinases. If allosamidin is to be used as a pharmacophore for development of novel compounds with activity against human pathogens, it is also necessary to take into account the human macrophage chitinase identified recently (26Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J.

Furthermore, 6% of the human population is homozygous for an inactivated form of the gene (26Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin.

Zimmerman P.A. Foster C.B. Zhu S. Kumaraswami V. Nutman T.B. Chanock S.J. Genes Immun. 2001; 2: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that the human chitinase plays a role in defense against chitinous pathogens (29Boot R.G. Blommaart E.F.C. Swart E. van der Vlugt K.G. Bijl N. Moe C. Place A. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6770-6778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 30Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Verhoek M. Strijland A.

Thus, it would be necessary to design allosamidin derivatives with specific activity against chitinases from pathogens but only weak inhibition of the human chitinase. Several allosamidin derivatives are already available (13Sakuda S. Chitin Enzymology. 2. Atec Edizioni, Grottammare, Italy1996: 203-212Google Scholar, 14Berecibar A. Grandjean C. Siriwardena A. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 779-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Although complexes of family 18 chitinases with allosamidin itself have been characterized (18Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Armand S. Kalk K.H. Isogai A. Henrissat B. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15619-15623Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 19van Aalten D.M.F. Komander D. Synstad B. Gåseidnes S.

Biol. 2002; 320: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), none of its derivatives have been analyzed structurally in the context of a chitinase. As a first step toward the design of specific allosamidins, we describe here the crystal structures of the human chitinase complexed with allosamidin (ALLO) 1The abbreviations used are: ALLO, allosamidin; DEME, demethylallosamidin; METH, methylallosamidin; GLCB, glucoallosamidin B; HCHT, human chitinase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: ALLO, allosamidin; DEME, demethylallosamidin; METH, methylallosamidin; GLCB, glucoallosamidin B; HCHT, human chitinase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and three derivatives, demethylallosamidin (DEME), methylallosamidin (METH), and glucoallosamidin B (GLCB) (Fig. 1). We also report the inhibitory properties of these derivatives against human chitinase, which, together with the structures, suggest that development of a specific, yet still potent, allosamidin-based chitinase inhibitor should be possible. Structure Determination—Human chitinase (HCHT) was isolated as described previously (21Fusetti F. von Moeller H. Houston D. Rozeboom H.J. Dijkstra B.W. Boot R.G. Aerts J.M.F. van Aalten D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25537-25544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As reported earlier, soaking of HCHT crystals with ALLO and its derivatives resulted in severe cracking (21Fusetti F. von Moeller H. Houston D. Rozeboom H.J. Dijkstra B.W. Boot R.G. Aerts J.M.F. van Aalten D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25537-25544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To overcome these problems, HCHT was co-crystallized with ALLO and its derivatives DEME, METH, and GLCB (Fig. 1). The complexes were formed through addition of 10 mm allosamidin derivative to the protein, which was at a concentration of 8 mg/ml. Crystals were then grown by vapor diffusion using 1 μl of protein-inhibitor complex and 1 μl of mother liquor consisting of 25% polyethylene glycol, 550 monomethyl ether, 0.01 m ZnSO4, and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, equilibrated against a reservoir containing 1 ml of mother liquor. Crystals appeared after 2 days and grew to a maximum size of 0.2 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm. The crystals were cryoprotected in a solution of mother liquor containing 3 m Li2SO4 and then frozen in a nitrogen cryostream for data collection. Data were collected on beamline ID14-EH2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) and beamline X11 at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany), and processed with the HKL suite of programs (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38556) Google Scholar) (Table II). The HCHT·ALLO structure was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (33Navaza J.

Briefly, in a final volume of 125 μl, a constant amount of enzyme was incubated with 0.022 mm substrate in McIlvain buffer (100 mm citric acid, 200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.2) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of different concentrations of inhibitor. After addition of 2.5 ml of 0.3 m glycine-NaOH, pH 10.6, the fluorescence of the liberated 4MU was quantified using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS2 fluorimeter (excitation 445 nm, emission 366 nm). The ability of chitotriosidase to transglycosylate does not allow determination of Ki values. Overall Structures—HCHT were grown in the presence of ALLO, DEME, METH, and GLCB (Fig. 1). The crystals diffracted to 1.85, 2.55, 2.60, and 2.55 Å, respectively. The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the native HCHT structure as a search model (21Fusetti F. von Moeller H. Houston D. Rozeboom H.J. Dijkstra B.W. Boot R.G.

Models for the allosamidins were only included in the refinement, when they were well defined by unbiased Fo - Fc,ϕcalc density (Fig. 3). Analysis of Ramachandran plots calculated with PROCHECK (37Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) reveal that there is only one residue (Asp-328) in a disallowed conformation, yet electron density for this residue is well defined. The allosamidins bind in a groove on the chitinase, occupying subsites -3 to -1 (Figs. 3 and 4). In the HCHT·ALLO complex, a second, disordered, allosamidin molecule (average B-factors 40.1 Å2, compared with 20.8 Å2 for the first molecule) is observed to bind to the protein, approximately occupying the +1 to +3 subsites. It is possible that this represents a weaker binding interaction and only occurs because of the high concentrations (10 mm) of allosamidin in the mother liquor. Subsequent comparisons and discussions will focus on the ordered allosamidin molecule only. Three chitinase·allosamidin complexes have been reported previously for hevamine (18Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Armand S. Kalk K.H. Isogai A. Henrissat B. Dijkstra B.W.

Biol. 2002; 320: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the HCHT·ALLO structure, the inhibitor binds in the same location and orientation as observed in these complexes. There are no significant backbone conformational changes; the HCHT·ALLO complex superimposes with an root mean square deviation of 0.36 Å on the HCHT structure Cα atoms. The tightest interactions are formed with the allosamizoline in the -1 subsite, which is lined with residues that are conserved in family 18 chitinases from a wide range of organisms (Figs. 2 and 3). Trp-358 stacks with the hydrophobic face of the allosamizoline, similar to the interaction of this residue with the -1 boat pyranose in the chitinase B-NAG5 complex (19van Aalten D.M.F. Komander D. Synstad B. Gåseidnes S. Peter M.G. Eijsink V.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8979-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Tyr-27, Phe-58, Gly-98, Ala-183, Met-210, and Met-356 are the main contributors to a hydrophobic pocket, which is occupied by the two allosamizoline methyl groups (Figs. 3 and 4). The allosamizoline moiety has several hydrogen bonding interactions with the protein (see Table IV). Asp-138 stabilizes the positive charge on the oxazoline (Fig. 3) and is flipped ∼180° around χ1 compared with the native structure (21Fusetti F. von Moeller H. Houston D. Rozeboom H.J. Dijkstra B.W.

Komander D. Synstad B. Gåseidnes S. Peter M.G. Eijsink V.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8979-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A similar water molecule is also found upon inspection of the C. immitis CTS1·ALLO complex published recently (20Bortone K. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S. Robertus J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This interaction is thought to be reminiscent of the attack of a water molecule, which hydrolyzes the oxazolinium ion reaction intermediate (19van Aalten D.M.F. Komander D. Synstad B. Gåseidnes S. Peter M.G. Eijsink V.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8979-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, this water molecule is not observed in the complexes with the allosamidins described here. In the HCHT·ALLO complex, the position of this water molecule is occupied by the N-acetyl group of the second disordered allosamidin molecule. The relatively low resolution diffraction data for the complexes with the allosamidin derivatives may not be sufficient to define the position of this particular water molecule. Although the allosamizoline moiety tightly binds conserved residues through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, there are fewer interactions with the two N-acetylallosamine sugars in the -2 and -3 subsites (see Table IV). The sugar in the -2 subsite makes two hydrogen bonds to Asn-100, via the O4 and O6 atoms (Fig. 3). Further hydrogen bonds are formed from O3 to Glu-297 and from Trp-358 to O7. The methyl on the N-acetyl group binds in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Tyr-267, Met-300, and Leu-362 (Fig. 3). The -3 sugar stacks with Trp-31, whereas a hydrogen bond is formed with the side chain of Glu-297 (Fig. 3). Two ordered water molecules mediate several inhibitor-protein hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3). Residues 266–337 form the α/β domain in HCHT, which is absent in the smaller family 18 chitinases such as hevamine and the fungal chitinases (Figs. 2 and 4). Therefore, these smaller enzymes have a more solvent exposed -2 subsite and almost no interactions with the N-acetylallosamine at -3 (18Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Armand S. Kalk K.H. Isogai A. Henrissat B. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15619-15623Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Enzymology—A large number of allosamidin derivatives have been synthesized and characterized for their biological activity (reviewed in Refs. 13Sakuda S. Chitin Enzymology. 2. Atec Edizioni, Grottammare, Italy1996: 203-212Google Scholar and 14Berecibar A. Grandjean C. Siriwardena A. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 779-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Here, we have focused on three derivatives (DEME, METH, and GLCB; Fig. 1) for which enzymological data with several chitinases is already available (compiled in Ref. 13Sakuda S. Chitin Enzymology. 2. Atec Edizioni, Grottammare, Italy1996: 203-212Google Scholar) (Table III). We have determined the apparent IC50 values of these derivatives against human chitinase using a standard assay with the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-chitotriose (4MU-NAG3) (Table III). The IC50 for ALLO (40 nm) has been reported previously (38Renkema, G. H. (1997) Chitotriosidase, Studies on the Human Chitinase. Ph.D. thesis, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsGoogle Scholar). Removal of one of the methyl groups on the allosamizoline moiety leads to an ∼20-fold increase in affinity (DEME; Fig. 1), compared with ALLO. If an extra methyl group is added to the O6 hydroxyl on the -3 allosamine, a similar increase in inhibition is observed (METH; Fig. 1 and Table III). If both these modifications are combined together with epimerization at carbon C3, only a 5-fold stronger inhibition is measured (GLCB; Fig. 1 and Table III), compared with ALLO. These data (together with other demethylallosamidin derivatives not discussed here (13Sakuda S. Chitin Enzymology. 2. Atec Edizioni, Grottammare, Italy1996: 203-212Google Scholar)) suggest that the major effect on inhibition is the large increase in binding upon removal of one of the methyl groups on the allosamizoline moiety. The inhibition data of these derivatives on other chitinases (Table III) shows that there are two different classes: one that, similar to HCHT, shows a 10–100-fold drop for DEME compared with ALLO (the chitinases from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans) and another that does not show this effect (the chitinases from Trichoderma harzianum and Bombyx mori). In addition, HCHT and the chitinases from T. harzianum and B. mori bind ALLO 10–1000-fold better than the fungal chitinases from S. cerevisiae and C. albicans. Inspection of the HCHT·ALLO structure (Fig. 3) and a sequence alignment (Fig. 2) reveals two potential reasons for this difference in inhibition. First, the S. cerevisiae and C. albicans chitinases are similar to the relatively small plant chitinase hevamine, which lacks the extra α/β domain that gives the active site a groove character and provides several contacts with the inhibitor (Tyr-267, Glu-297, and Met-300 in HCHT; Figs. 3 and 4). In addition, Met-210 and Met-356, two hydrophobic residues that form part of the pocket for the allosamizoline methyl groups, are conserved in HCHT, T. harzianum, and B. mori chitinases but replaced by more hydrophilic residues in the small fungal chitinases.Table IIIApparent IC50 values of the allosamidin derivatives against chitinases from different speciesS. cerevisiaeC. albicansT. harzianumB. moriHumanALLO550001000013004840DEME48011001300811.9METH60000140001900652.6GLCB81013002600658.0 Open table in a new tab Comparison of the Complexes—Despite the wealth of synthetic and natural allosamidins described in the literature, currently only complexes of family 18 chitinases with native ALLO have been determined (19van Aalten D.M.F. Komander D. Synstad B. Gåseidnes S. Peter M.G. Eijsink V.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8979-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 20Bortone K. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.

Structure. 1994; 2: 1181-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The complexes of HCHT with the DEME, METH, and GLCB allosamidin derivatives (Fig. 1) show no significant backbone conformational changes and superimpose with root mean square deviations of 0.32, 0.31, and 0.32 Å on HCHT Cα atoms, respectively. Analysis of the binding pocket shows that although several key hydrogen bonds are conserved (Table IV and Fig. 3), there are differences in hydrogen bonding and side chain conformation. Demethylallosamidin—In the HCHT·DEME structures, where the allosamidin lacks one of the methyl groups on the allosamizoline (Fig. 1), the remaining methyl group points toward the oxygen side of the oxazoline ring, creating a small void that is filled by Glu-140 and Asp-138 rotating up to 30 degrees around χ1/2. This brings the Asp-138 Oδ2 atom closer to the allosamizoline nitrogen that carries the remaining methyl group, almost allowing formation of a hydrogen bond (distance 3.7 Å) (Fig. 3). This could explain the observed increase in affinity that is observed for DEME (Table III). There are no further noticeable conformational changes in the -1 binding site. The residues surrounding the allosamizoline moiety are the only ones that are highly conserved in family 18 chitinases (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Analysis of sequence differences does not reveal an amino acid change that is consistent with the different changes in inhibition when comparing ALLO and DEME binding to a range of chitinases (Table III). However, residues 95, 208, 210, and 356 do form part of the hydrophobic pocket for the allosamizoline methyl groups and are not conserved. It is possible that several concerted changes at these positions are responsible for the two types of effects on inhibition (i.e. no change or 10–100-fold stronger inhibition; Table III) for DEME. Methylallosamidin—The structure of the HCHT·METH complex reveals that introduction of a methyl group on O6 of the -3 allosamine displaces an ordered water molecule from the binding pocket (Figs. 1 and 3). This ordered water molecule hydrogen bonds with DEME but not with ALLO (and is therefore not shown in Fig. 3-ALLO). In HCHT, addition of the methyl group to ALLO appears to increase the inhibition (Table III). A possible explanation could be the entropic gain through displacement of the ordered water molecule, yet a similar effect is not observed in the other chitinases (Table III). In the absence of structural data for these chitinases it is difficult to explain this, in particular because the entire α/β domain is missing in the smaller fungal chitinases (Fig. 2). Glucoallosamidin B—In the GLCB derivative three modifications are combined: removal of one of the allosamizoline methyls (as in DEME), addition of a methyl on O6 of the -3 allosamine (as in METH), and epimerization of the -2 allosamine to a glucosamine (Fig. 1). The HCHT·GLCB complex (Fig. 3) shows several changes compared with the HCHT·ALLO complex. In general, the GLCB molecule appears to be shifted about 0.5 Å toward the reducing end of the binding cleft (Fig. 3). This leads to weakening of the key hydrogen bonds in the -1 subsite (Table IV), which may be partially responsible for the weaker inhibition of HCHT, compared with the DEME and METH derivatives. Also, changes similar to those in the HCHT·DEME (rotation of Asp-138 and Glu-140) and the HCHT·METH complex (displacement of an ordered water molecule) are observed (Fig. 3). In addition, the equatorial O3 oxygen is no longer able to hydrogen bond another ordered water molecule observed in the HCHT·ALLO complex. The displacement of this water molecule leads to the loss of the water-mediated hydrogen bond with Arg-269 (Fig. 3). At the same time, however, the equatorial configuration of the O3 hydroxyl allows formation of the hydrogen bond with the pyranose oxygen of the -3 sugar, which is generally found in glucopolymers. The trends observed in the GLCB inhibition data (Table III) are similar to those for DEME, suggesting that removal of one of the allosamizoline methyls is the dominating effect. Design of Specific Allosamidin Derivatives—Inhibition data of allosamidin and its derivatives show that there are significant differences in inhibition against the different chitinases (Table III). This suggests that if allosamidin is used as a template in novel synthetic studies aimed at designing derivatives against a specific chitinase, it would be possible to engineer a certain degree of specificity. This is important if such derivatives are used as antibiotics against human pathogens, as these molecules should not inhibit human chitinase, which has been suggested to be part of an innate defense against chitinous pathogens (29Boot R.G. Blommaart E.F.C. Swart E. van der Vlugt K.G. Bijl N. Moe C. Place A. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6770-6778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 30Boot R.G.

Genes Immun. 2001; 2: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The structures described here allow for an evaluation of the potential for structure-based design of specific allosamidins. When sequence conservation is interpreted in the context of the HCHT·ALLO complex (Fig. 4) it appears that the only residues that are conserved and form part of the binding site are those interacting with the allosamizoline (Figs. 2, 3, 4). This would suggest it is difficult to make allosamizoline derivatives that are specific for certain chitinases. Yet not all residues contacting the allosamizoline are conserved (Fig. 2), and the differential inhibition for the DEME derivative (Table III) demonstrates it is possible to exploit these differences. For instance, Asn-100 makes hydrogen bonding interactions with the -2/-3 sugars (Fig. 3 and Table IV) yet is only present in the human chitinase. In general, there is no sequence conservation in the residues surrounding the -2 and -3 subsites (Figs. 2 and 4). This is especially true for the smaller S. cerevisiae and C. albicans chitinases, which lack the extra α/β domain that harbors several residues that are seen to interact with the allosamidins in the complexes described here (Figs. 2, 3, 4 and Table IV). Thus, the binding site in HCHT has a deep groove character, whereas in hevamine (and the closely related small fungal chitinases) it is a shallow pocket (22Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Kalk K.H. Beintema J.J. Dijkstra B.W. Structure. 1994; 2: 1181-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Hence, it should be possible to design derivatives that have larger groups on the -2 and -3 sugars, fitting only the smaller, more open, chitinases. Alternatively, moieties could be introduced that interact specifically with side chains lining the deeper grooves of the larger chitinases. Recently, an additional mammalian chitinase has been described that is mainly expressed in the stomach (29Boot R.G. Blommaart E.F.C. Swart E. van der Vlugt K.G. Bijl N. Moe C. Place A. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6770-6778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). This protein has 52% sequence identity with the human macrophage chitinase and also contains the additional α/β fold. Given the different expression patterns and the fact that this additional mammalian chitinase has a pH optimum of around 2, it is likely that it plays a different role than the human macrophage chitinase and has enough sequence differences to allow development of chitinase-specific inhibitors. The structures of the human chitinase in complex with allosamidin and its derivatives have given new insights into the molecular mechanisms and specificity of these potent family 18 chitinase inhibitors. The dimethyl derivative, 10- to 100-fold more potent than allosamidin against most chitinases, appears to bind more strongly because of possible extra interactions with conserved residues that are part of the family 18 chitinase sequence signature. Modifications of the -2 and -3 N-acetylallosamines lead to displacement of ordered water molecules and altered hydrogen bonding with the protein. The structures could be used for further structure-based optimization of allosamidin."

Our previous studies showed that cells expressing thymidine phosphorylase stimulated endothelial cell migration in vitro. This was a consequence of the intracellular metabolism of thymidine by thymidine phosphorylase and subsequent extracellular release of 2-deoxyribose. The mechanisms by which 2-deoxyribose might mediate thymidine phosphorylase-induced cell migration in vitro, however, are obscure. Here we show that both thymidine phosphorylase and 2-deoxyribose stimulated the formation of focal adhesions and the tyrosine 397 phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Although similar actions occurred upon treatment with the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thymidine phosphorylase differed from VEGF in that its effect on endothelial cell migration was blocked by antibodies to either integrin α5β1 or αvβ3, whereas VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration was only blocked by the αvβ3 antibody. Further, thymidine phosphorylase and 2-deoxyribose, but not VEGF, increased the association of both focal adhesion kinase and the focal adhesion-associated protein vinculin with integrin α5β1 and, in intact cells, increased the co-localization of focal adhesion kinase with α5β1. Thymidine phosphorylase and 2-deoxyribose-induced focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation was blocked by the antibodies to α5β1 and αvβ3, directly linking the migration and signaling components of thymidine phosphorylase and 2-deoxyribose action. Cell surface expression of α5β1 was also increased by thymidine phosphorylase and 2-deoxyribose.

Angiogenesis, the process of generating new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels, is a fundamental, tightly regulated process in reproduction and wound healing (1Folkman J. Singh Y. J. Biol.

It is well established that the process of angiogenesis is essential for tumorigenesis and the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors (1Folkman J. Singh Y. J. Biol.

Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7176) Google Scholar). EC migration is regulated by factors that are produced and secreted by tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating stromal cells and is further dependent on the interaction of the endothelial cells with the extracellular matrix (ECM) (3Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar). The integrin family protein heterodimers are the major cellular receptors for ECM and mediate cell-matrix interactions that activate multiple signaling pathways important for regulating endothelial cell responses, including cell attachment, adhesion, migration, survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis (4Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar). The engagement of the integrins with their extracellular ligands triggers the formation of focal adhesions, large, stable structures that are sites of adhesion and through which signals are transduced (5Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5184) Google Scholar, 6Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The integrin-matrix interaction is critical to the angiogenic process, and its disruption forms the basis for several experimental therapeutic approaches to the treatment of cancer (7Kerbel R. Folkman J. Nat. Rev. 2002; 2: 727-739Crossref Scopus (1403) Google Scholar).Integrins function as both outside-in and inside-out mediators of cell signaling due to their ability to regulate the activities of cytoplasmic kinases, growth factor receptors, and ion channels (reviewed in Refs. 4Giancotti F.G.

The cytoplasmic tails of integrins lack enzymatic activity; therefore, they transduce signals by stimulating the association of adapter proteins that link cytoplasmic and transmembrane kinases with the cytoskeleton. Interactions with other cellular signaling pathways have also been described. The multiple complex and overlapping integrin-ECM interactions are a consequence of the 20 or more different α and β subunits that dimerize in many different combinations and are differentially expressed on various cell types (9Hynes R.O.

Expression of specific integrins can be up-regulated by cytokines and angiogenic factors, thereby altering the nature of the interaction of the cell with the ECM. Integrins also appear to be necessary for the optimal activation of growth factor and angiogenic factor receptors, including receptors for VEGF, insulin, fibroblast growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, and platelet-derived growth factor (4Giancotti F.G.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). As such, cross-talk between integrins and growth factor receptors amplifies the angiogenic response on extracellular matrices that engage those integrins.Upon binding to ECM, integrins directly activate cell signaling pathways (4Giancotti F.G.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a 125-kDa nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase that is recruited to focal adhesions by integrin engagement with ECM (6Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 13Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Concurrent with these events, FAK is tyrosine-phosphorylated, and thereby its own kinase activity is increased (14Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This activation is an early event associated with the assembly of focal adhesions and is accompanied by the recruitment of other cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal proteins to the focal adhesions, including talin, paxillin, vinculin, and ultimately actin (6Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). It is these interactions that place FAK in a central role in mediating cell attachment and migration.The angiogenic factor platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor is identical to human thymidine phosphorylase (TP), an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of thymidine to thymine and 2-deoxyribose-1-phosphate; the latter is subsequently converted to 2-deoxyribose (2dR) (15Furukawa T.

Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1063-1072PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which TP mediates angiogenesis is unknown; we have used endothelial cell migration as an in vitro model to address this question. No cell surface receptor for TP has been identified; indeed, the protein lacks a signal sequence required for cell secretion (20Ishikawa F. Miyazono K. Hellman U. Drexler H. Wernstedt C. Usuki K. Takaku F. Risau W. Heldin C-H. Nature. 1989; 338: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Our previous studies of the mechanisms by which tumor cells expressing high levels of TP induce EC migration have demonstrated that it is mediated by the intracellular synthesis and extracellular release of the thymidine metabolite 2dR to form a chemotactic gradient; the effects of 2dR on EC were identical to those of TP (27Hotchkiss K.A. Ashton A.W. Klein R.S. Lenzi M.L. Zhu G.H. Schwartz E.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 527-533PubMed Google Scholar). That the angiogenic actions of TP are mediated by a diffusible metabolite clearly distinguishes it from other angiogenic factors (e.g. VEGF), which work, as do most cytokines, by specific binding to cell surface receptors. That TP and 2dR can stimulate endothelial cell chemotaxis indicates that they must engage, in an unknown manner, intracellular signaling pathways that lead to migration.The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of TP/2dR on focal adhesion formation, to define the role of extracellular matrix proteins and their cognate integrin receptors in TP/2dR-mediated migration, and, in the absence of a known receptor for TP/2dR, to identify specific signaling pathways engaged by TP/2dR to mediate endothelial cell migration and focal adhesion formation. This report documents these events and also provides evidence that there are both similarities and differences in aspects of the activation of cell surface integrins and focal adhesion formation in EC between TP and VEGF.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—A human TP cDNA (kindly provided by C.-H. Heldin) was used to prepare recombinant TP. VEGF was from R&D Systems, and 2dR was from Sigma. Antibodies used for neutralization, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were all commercially available and obtained from the indicated sources. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated.Isolation of Endothelial Cells from Human Umbilical Veins—Human venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from umbilical cords as previously described (28Ashton A.W. Yokota R. John G. Zhao S. Suadicani S.O. Spray D.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35562-35570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Culture medium consisted of Medium 199 (M199) supplemented with 20% (v/v) newborn calf serum, 5% (v/v) pooled human serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 5 units/ml penicillin G, 5 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 10 units/ml heparin, and 7.5 μg/ml EC growth supplement (Invitrogen). Primary cultures of HUVEC were passaged with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA. Confluent HUVEC monolayers (passages 1–4) were used in the experiments described below.Boyden Chamber Assay of Endothelial Cell Migration—Confluent HUVEC monolayers were cultured with media lacking growth supplement for 48 h prior to harvesting with cell dissociation solution (Sigma). Harvested cells were suspended at 106/ml in M199 with 1% serum, and 105 cells were seeded into precoated transwell inserts (8-μm pore; Costar). Inserts containing HUVEC were placed into a 24-well plate containing M199 with 1% serum and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. HUVEC migration was stimulated by the addition of a purified factor (TP, VEGF, or 2dR) to the lower chamber. After 5 h, HUVEC were stained with 10 μm Cell Tracker Green (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the upper membrane of the insert was swabbed to remove nonmigrated cells. Inserts were washed three times with PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and mounted on microscope slides. HUVEC migration was quantitated by counting the number of cells in three random fields (×100 total magnification) per insert. The data are expressed as the average number of cells/field.Where indicated, migration of HUVEC on alternate substrates was examined by coating the inserts with 0.2% (w/v) gelatin or fibronectin, thrombospondin, or vitronectin (10 μg/ml). In addition, the involvement of integrins in TP-induced migration was determined through inclusion of monoclonal antibodies. For these experiments, cells were treated for 15 min with antibodies (10 μg/ml) against specific integrin subunits and heterodimers (Chemicon International) prior to plating (along with the antibody) for 1 h in the Boyden chamber. Antibody was also added to the lower wells upon the addition of the chemotactic stimulus. Nonspecific IgG was used as the control in these experiments.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—Confluent HUVEC, seeded on fibronectin, were treated with TP (100 ng/ml), VEGF (10 ng/ml), or 2dR (1 μm) for up to 4 h. Monolayers were washed twice in PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and scraped into immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin). Cell suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, protein content was determined, and 300 μg of total protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein G-agarose beads coated with saturating amounts of antibodies to integrins α3, αvβ3, and α5β1 (Chemicon International, CA) or p125FAK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The resulting immune complexes were recovered after centrifugation by boiling for 10 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer.For immunoblotting, aliquots of whole cell lysates (30 μg) or isolated immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions using 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed by immunoblotting as previously described (28Ashton A.W. Yokota R. John G. Zhao S. Suadicani S.O. Spray D.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35562-35570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) using antibodies against phosphotyrosine, FAK, integrin α5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), vinculin (Sigma), integrin β1 (Chemicon), and FAK phosphorylated on various tyrosine residues (including Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr861, and Tyr925) (Biosource International). Antibodies against α-tubulin and unphosphorylated FAK were used to control for loading when using whole cell lysates, whereas antibodies against integrins β1, β3, and α3 were used to quantitate protein loading for the immunoprecipitation reactions.Immunofluorescent Staining for Focal Adhesion Complexes—HUVEC were seeded on Fn and stimulated with TP (100 ng/ml), 2dR (1 μm), VEGF (10 ng/ml), or media (control) for 4 h. HUVEC were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and rendered permeable by incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. Cells were washed three times with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (PBS-B) and blocked with 3% preimmune goat serum in PBS-B for 90 min at room temperature. For staining focal adhesions, cells were incubated with antibodies against vinculin (Sigma), FAK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or integrin α5β1 (Chemicon) for 1 h. Staining was detected with either Cy3-or FITC-conjugated second antibodies, and images were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 krypton/argon laser-scanning confocal microscope on a Nikon Eclipse 200 microscope with a ×60 numerical aperture 1.4 planapo infinity corrected objective. Controls were imaged to ensure that there was no background fluorescence and no cross-talk from the FITC channel to the Cy3 channel. For co-localization analysis, Cy3 and FITC images were overlaid using Photoshop 6.0 imaging software (Adobe Systems). The analysis of focal adhesion size and number was performed using automated image analysis software (Scion Image).Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell Surface Integrin Expression—Confluent HUVEC monolayers on fibronectin-coated plates were treated with media alone (control), TP (100 ng/ml), VEGF (10 ng/ml), or 2dR (1 μm) for up to 4 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested using cell dissociation solution. Cells were suspended in PBS-B for 30 min at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation, antibodies to integrin α5β1 or αvβ3 (5 μg/ml; Chemicon) were added. Negative controls were stained with preimmune mouse serum. Cells were incubated with antibodies for 90 min at 4 °C and washed three times with PBS-B before incubation with an FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100 in PBS-B) for 60 min. Analysis of integrin surface expression was performed on a flow cytometer using an argon ion laser (λex 488 nm). Data are expressed as-fold change in mean fluorescence intensity (Gm) of stimulated HUVEC compared with control unstimulated HUVEC.Statistical Analysis—Data were pooled, and statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test.RESULTSTP and VEGF Have Additive Effects on HUVEC Migration— Induction of migration of EC is one of the cellular effects associated with the neovascularization actions of angiogenic factors. Both VEGF and TP have been previously shown to be chemoattractants for HUVEC, although mechanistic studies have only been extensively reported for VEGF. To assess potential interactions between the two chemotactic agents in inducing endothelial cell migration, HUVEC were stimulated with TP and VEGF, alone and in combination, in increasing concentrations. As seen in Fig. 1, concentrations of 2.5 ng/ml TP and 1 ng/ml VEGF produced only modest (i.e. less than 25% of maximal) induction of migration. When tested together at these concentrations, the extent of migration induced was close to that expected for the addition of the individual agents. A similar additive effect was observed when the two agents were combined at concentrations that individually were approximately half-maximal for induction of migration (10 and 5 ng/ml for TP and VEGF, respectively (Fig. 1)), and the combined effect of the two agents was equivalent to the maximal effect seen with either agent alone (not shown). Increasing the concentration of either TP or VEGF above this point did not further increase the extent of migration. Thus, TP and VEGF appear to be primary mediators of HUVEC migration whose chemotactic effects are additive in nature.The simplest, although not exclusive, explanation for these observations is that TP and VEGF utilize the same or substantially overlapping pathways to induce HUVEC migration. These pathways are not likely to be identical in all aspects, however, as VEGF acts by binding to a family of well defined, high affinity cell surface receptors with which TP most likely does not interact with in a similar manner.TP, 2dR, and VEGF All Induce Focal Adhesion Formation and FAK Phosphorylation in HUVEC in Vitro—Whereas the effects of VEGF on EC are well described, the signaling mechanisms induced by TP/2dR to elicit a migratory response are undocumented. Thus, we examined the signaling pathways used by VEGF to compare them with those of TP/2dR. One of the primary mechanisms used by VEGF to induce migration is the activation of integrins and their respective signaling pathways. We first examined whether TP/2dR could enhance focal adhesion formation in HUVEC. Focal adhesion content of EC monolayers stimulated for 4 h with TP (100 ng/ml), 2dR (1 μm), or VEGF (10 ng/ml) was examined using vinculin immunostaining (Fig. 2). Focal adhesions in HUVEC in media alone (control) were few in number and small in size. Focal adhesion formation was significantly induced by treatment with either TP or 2dR and was equivalent to the induction by VEGF (Fig. 2A). In all cases, the number of focal adhesions/cell was increased 3.5-fold, and the average size of the focal adhesions was increased 2-fold in HUVEC treated with the chemotactic agents (Fig. 2, B and C).Fig. 2TP, 2dR, and VEGF induce focal adhesion formation in HUVEC.A, HUVEC were seeded on Fn and stimulated with TP (100 ng/ml), 2dR (1 μm), VEGF (10 ng/ml), or media (control) for 4 h. Focal adhesions (white arrows) were visualized by immunofluorescence staining of HUVEC with anti-vinculin and Cy3-conjugated second antibodies. Photographs are representative of three independent experiments; bar, 20 μm. The size (B; mean pixels ± S.D.) and number (C; mean ± S.D.) of focal adhesions in HUVEC were estimated from photomicro-graphs using image analysis software. *, significantly different from control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since FAK is important for the formation of focal adhesions by multiple growth factors (6Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), we assessed whether FAK Tyr phosphorylation, as a marker of activation, was elevated in response to TP/2dR. FAK was immunoprecipitated from lysates of HUVEC stimulated with TP (100 ng/ml), VEGF (10 ng/ml), or 2dR (1 μm), and the levels of Tyr phosphorylation were examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). Total Tyr phosphorylation of FAK was stimulated by all factors with similar kinetics. For each stimulus, FAK phosphorylation was increased at 1 h and maximally stimulated at 4 h, and phosphorylation persisted for 24 h (Fig. 3A). FAK can be phosphorylated on multiple Tyr residues, and we next defined which residues were involved using site-specific antibodies. As can be seen in Fig. 3B, TP and 2dR induced significant phosphorylation of residues Tyr397, the autophosphorylation site, and Tyr925. VEGF also induced phosphorylation of these sites. In contrast, TP and 2dR suppressed the phosphorylation of Tyr576 of FAK, which remained unaffected by VEGF stimulation. Thus, TP and 2dR appear to activate FAK to regulate focal adhesion formation and enhance endothelial cell migration.Fig. 3Stimulation of HUVEC with TP, 2dR, or VEGF enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK. HUVEC were seeded on Fn and stimulated with TP (100 ng/ml), 2dR (1 μm), VEGF (10 ng/ml), or media (control) for 0.5, 1, 4, or 24 h, as indicated. Changes in p125FAK phosphorylation were visualized by immunoprecipitating (IP) FAK and probing with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (A) or by immunoblotting (WB, western blot) with the indicated specific antibodies to phosphotyrosine residues 397, 407, 576, 861, and 923 in p125FAK (B). Protein loading was determined by reprobing the membranes for nonphosphorylated FAK. Immunoblots are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TP-and VEGF-stimulated HUVEC Migration Was Optimal on Fibronectin and Mediated through Two Distinct Integrins— The observed increase in focal adhesion formation and FAK activation by TP and 2dR was strong evidence that these agents activated signaling pathways that regulate cell attachment and migration. Focal adhesions and, in particular, their integrin constituents are the point at which extracellular and intracellular events interface. Integrin heterodimers mediate the attachment of cells to different extracellular matrix components via their extracellular domains, with the attachment to each matrix protein mediated through a specific subset of integrins (29Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To begin to explore the nature of the activation of these processes, we next determined the matrix protein(s) on which the response of HUVEC to TP and 2dR was optimal.

Firms producing pharmaceutical, agricultural, and cosmetic goods have used ethnobotanical knowledge of indigenous people to develop commercial goods ([1][1], [2][2]). The commercial use of ethnobotanical knowledge raises concerns about payments owed to indigenous peoples who supply the knowledge ([3][3]). Indigenous peoples and their advocates say that ethnobotanical knowledge is held communally ([4][4]) and that firms should share the benefits from commercial uses of indigenous knowledge. Despite these claims, we do not know how much indigenous peoples share ethnobotanical knowledge. Here we use a cultural consensus model ([5][5]) to show that Tsimane' Amerindians share much ethnobotanical knowledge.

The Tsimane' number ∼7000 people and live in ∼100 villages in the Bolivian lowlands ([6][6]). Habitats range from savannas to wet, moist, and gallery forests. Tsimane' show large variation in socioeconomic attributes. Some live in small villages without schools, speak only Tsimane', and forage and practice shifting cultivation. Others speak Spanish, live in large, accessible, permanent villages with schools, and sell crops and labor. Because Tsimane' contain much variation, they are ideal to estimate the amount of shared ethnobotanical knowledge in an indigenous group.

We collected socioeconomic and ethnobotanical knowledge data during 18 months (May 1999 to November 2000) in two villages with different habitats and market exposure, Yaranda (which is a 3-day canoe trip from the nearest market town) and San Antonio (which is a 3-hour walk to the nearest town). Panel data served to develop a survey applied to 511 Tsimane' in 59 villages. In villages with ≤12 households, we surveyed all households. In villages with 13+ households, we randomly selected 12 households for interviews. For the interview, we randomly selected one household head. The average distance of the 59 villages to the closest town was 35 km (SD = 24.16, max = 100.5, min = 0.0).

To construct the knowledge test, we used published literature and data from free listings of useful plants ( n = 50) used by the Tsimane'. From the list, we randomly selected 21 plants to construct a multiple-choice questionnaire. We asked all subjects whether each plant could be used for medicine, firewood, tools, construction, and/or food. We collected responses in a matrix with plant names on the x axis and their uses on the y axis.

We define knowledge as agreement between informants and use cultural consensus and cultural competence to measure this parameter. Cultural competence is the proportion of questions each person answered correctly; we equate correct with the most frequent response in the population or group. Cultural consensus refers to the group average similarity in responses. Data are consensual if the first eigenvalue is at least three times larger than the second, provided no estimate of knowledge is <0. To estimate whether agreement was larger among people in the same village than among all subjects, we first estimated the agreement of each informant with people in the same village and then with the entire sample.

When comparing subjects with people in the same village, we found that on a 0 to 1 scale, the average individual cultural competence was 0.83 (SD = 0.10) ([Table 1][7]). The average cultural consensus of the 59 villages was 90.60 (SD = 6.18). All villages but one fitted the consensus model, all informants had positive competence scores, and the ratio between the first and second eigenvalue was >3. Results suggest that people in the same village share more ethnobotanical knowledge than between villages.

Table 1 
Summary of cultural competence and consensus in 59 villages and 511 subjects.



We pooled people in the sample to compare individual agreement for all Tsimane'. When people were compared with the whole group, the average cultural competence was 0.62 (SD = 0.11), 20% lower than when compared with people in the same village. Cultural consensus of ethnobotanical knowledge among the Tsimane' was 66.3, lower than the average within villages. All informants had positive answers; the ratio between the first and second eigenvalues was 3.38. Results confirm the idea that ethnobotanical knowledge is a consensual domain among Tsimane' of different villages.

There is growing international and national agreement about the need for prior consent and benefit sharing with indigenous peoples when outsiders use ethnobotanical knowledge. As indigenous peoples have advocated and as this research shows, the collective nature of traditional knowledge should be considered when outsiders use indigenous knowledge commercially. Laws to protect indigenous knowledge must also acknowledge the communal endowment of indigenous knowledge and the traditional rights and responsibilities over such knowledge.

https://openalex.org/W2049621013,"The transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) is modified by coactivators, corepressors, and chromatin remodeling complexes. We have previously shown that the metastasis-associated protein-1 (MTA1), a component of histone deacetylase and nucleosome remodeling complexes, represses ER-driven transcription by recruiting histone deacetylases to the estrogen receptor element (ERE)-containing target gene chromatin in breast cancer cells. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening to clone MTA1-interacting proteins, we identified a previously uncharacterized molecule, which we named as MTA1-interacting coactivator (MICoA). Our findings suggest that estrogen signaling promotes nuclear translocation of MICoA and that MICoA interacts with MTA1 both in vitro and in vivo. MICoA binds to the C-terminal region of MTA1, whereas MTA1 binds to the N-terminal MICoA containing one nuclear receptor interaction LSRLL motif. We showed that MICoA is an ER coactivator, cooperates with other ER coactivators, stimulates ER-transactivation functions, and associates with the endogenous ER and its target gene promoter chromatin. MTA1 also repressed MICoA-mediated stimulation of ERE-mediated transcription in the presence of ER and ER variants with naturally occurring mutations, such as D351Y and K303R, and that it interfered with the association of MICoA with the ER-target gene chromatin. Because chromatin is a highly dynamic structure and because MTA1 and MICoA could be detected within the same complex, these findings suggest that MTA1 and MICoA might transmodulate functions of each other and any potential deregulation of MTA1 is likely to contribute to the functional inactivation of the ER pathway, presumably by derecruitment of MICoA from ER target promoter chromatin.

Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). The biological effects of estrogen are mediated by its binding to the structurally and functionally distinct estrogen receptors (ER-α and ER-β). ER-α is the major estrogen receptor in the mammary epithelium. Like other steroid nuclear receptors, ER-α comprises of an N-terminal transcriptional activation function (AF1) domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain that contains a ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function 2 (AF2) domain (4Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Binding of hormone to ER triggers conformational changes that allow ER to bind the responsive elements in the target gene promoters. The ligand-activated ER-α then translocates to the nucleus, binds to the 13-base pair palindromic estrogen response element (ERE) in the target gene promoters, and stimulates gene transcription, thereby promoting the growth of breast cancer cells. In addition, a series of recent studies also demonstrate other actions of the estrogen receptors, which involve protein-protein interactions (i.e. with AP-1 and SP-1) rather than direct DNA binding. As with hormonal regulation, the transcriptional activity of ER is affected by a number of regulatory cofactors including chromatin-remodeling complexes, coactivators, and corepressors (5Chen J.D.

Coactivators generally do not bind to the DNA but are recruited to the target gene promoters through protein-protein interactions with the ER. Examples of ER coactivators include, members of the p160 family, SRC1–3, AIBI, TRAM1, RAC3, cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein CBP and p300 (10Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L.

DiRenzo J. Ewen M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5383-5387Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Corepressors preferentially associate with antagonist occupied ER (12Graham J.D.

Endocrinol,. 1998; 12: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Among the ER corepressors, NCoR and SMRT are widely characterized molecules that have been implicated in the transcriptional silencing that happens in the absence of ligands (15Lin R.J. Nagy L. Inoue S. Shao W. Miller Jr., W.H. Evans R.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). In addition, a few bifunctional coregulators such as PELP1 also exist that can act both as coactivators and corepressors of ER (16Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2666) Google Scholar) Evidence suggests that multiprotein complexes containing coactivators, ERs, and transcriptional regulators assemble in response to hormone binding and that they activate transcription. The molecular mechanisms of ER, the composition of the ER coactivator proteins, and the way these hormones exhibit tissue or cell type-specific responses are active areas of investigation. A structural analysis of the ER coactivators has identified a 5-amino acid NR motif LXXLL (where X is any amino acid) that can mediate coregulator binding to the liganded ERs (17Huang N. Vom Baur E.

For transcription factors to access DNA, the repressive chromatin structure must be remodeled. Dynamic alterations in the chromatin structure resulting from the acetylation of histones can facilitate or suppress the access of the transcription factors to nucleosomal DNA, leading to transcriptional regulation (20Berger S.L.

Hyperacetylated chromatin is generally associated with transcriptional activation, whereas hypoacetylated chromatin is associated with transcriptional repression (23Blanco J.C. Minucci S. Lu J.

Transcriptional outcome is regulated by a dynamic interaction of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Coactivators like SRC1–3, CBP/p300 have been shown to possess intrinsic HAT activity (4Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) whereas corepressors such as NCoR and metastasis associated 1 (MTA1) protein are associated with HDACs (33Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Hendzel M.J. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Woelter W. Verdin E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 34Jepsen K. Rosenfeld M.G. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The MTA1 gene was originally identified by differential expression in rat mammary adenocarcinoma metastatic cells and is now known to correlate well with the metastatic potential of several human cell lines and tissues (14Zhang X. Jeyakumar M. Petukhov S. Bagchi M.K. Mol. Endocrinol,. 1998; 12: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 35Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M.

Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). MTA1 has also been shown to physically interact with HDAC and repress the estrogen receptor α-driven transcription by recruiting HDAC to the ERE-containing target gene chromatin in breast cancer cells (35Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Although MTA1 is known to be a part of the HDAC complex, the nature of its target or targets remains unidentified. To better understand the cellular functions of MTA1 in breast cancer cells, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to clone MTA1-interacting proteins, and identified a previously uncharacterized protein (GenBankTM accession number S82447), which we named as MTA1-interacting coactivator (MICoA). Here, we show that MICoA is a bona fide coactivator of ER-α transactivation functions and that its interaction with MTA1 controls the dynamics of ER-driven transactivation by influencing its association with the ER target gene promoter chromatin. Plasmid Construction and Two-hybrid Library Screening—The full-length MTA1 (1–715 amino acids) was digested at BamHI and XbaI (blunt end) and ligated to the pGBKT7 vector that expresses proteins fused to amino acids 1–147 of the GAL4-DNA-binding domain at BamHI and PstI (blunt end) (Clontech). MTA1 baits were constructed by deleting 1–254 amino acids from the N-terminal of MTA1 by cutting and self-ligating with NcoI that cleaves the first 254 amino acids. The remaining 255–715 amino acids of the C-terminal MTA1 were used as bait. This bait was used to screen a mammary gland cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain (Clontech) screened according to manufacturer's instructions. Positive clones were also verified by one-on-one transformations and selection on agar plates lacking leucine and tryptophan (LT) or adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan (AHLT) and also processed by β-galactosidase assay. Full-length MICoA was either cloned into pCDNA 3.1A or pGEX 5X-1 vectors at EcoRI and XhoI sites. Cell Cultures and Reagents—Human breast cancer cells were cultured in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For estrogen treatment experiments, regular medium was replaced by medium containing 3% DCC (charcoal-stripped serum). Antibodies against c-myc tag were from MBL International, Watertown, MA. Anti-ER was from Upstate Biotechnology, whereas anti-mouse- and anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase conjugate were from Amersham Biosciences. In Situ Hybridization—For in situ hybridization, mouse mammary gland tissues or 13.5-day-old embryos were cut out and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and frozen sections were cut (35Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization was done by using the digoxigenin (Roche Diagnostics)-labeled riboprobe. A 375-bp mouse MICoA cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR, subcloned into TOPO II vector (Promega), and used for riboprobe synthesis under the control of T7 promoter. Primers used were: F, CCAGCCCGGAATTCCCATGCTGTCCCGCCTC; R, GGAGGGAACTCGAGCTAGGAAGGGGCAGAC; RNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin and hybridized for 16–20 h in buffer containing 1 μg/ml riboprobes, 50% formamide, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.2% Ficoll 400, 0.2% polyvinylpyrolidone, 10% dextran sulfate, 200 μg/ml yeast total RNA, and 50 mm dithiothreitol. Alkaline phosphatase-labeled sheep anti-digoxigenin antibody was applied and signals were visualized by nitro blue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Hybridization with sense probe was used as background control. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Approximately 106 cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde (final concentration, v/v) for 10 min at 37 °C to cross-link histones to DNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described (35Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The sequences of the forward and reverse primers for pS2 used in this study were: GAATTAGCTTAGGCCTAGACGGAATG and AGGATTTGCTGATAGACAGAGACGAC, respectively. HAT Assay—Cells were either treated with/without estrogen (10-9m). Then cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-T7 antibody. Immunoprecipitate was taken for histone acetyltransferase assay by the HAT-Check activity assay kit (Pierce). HAT assay with positive control in each assay was performed as per the instructions with little modifications (5Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Imaging—MCF7 cells were plated on glass coverslips in 6-well culture plates. When the cells were ∼50% confluent, they were changed to DCC medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum for 48 h, then treated with estrogen (10-9m) for 30 min with or without pretreatment with the anti-estrogen ICI (10-8m) for 1 h. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in cold methanol for 6 min, then processed for immunofluorescence staining of c-myc-tagged MTA1 or estrogen receptor. Cells were counterstained with ToPro3 to visualize the nucleus. Slides were further processed for imaging and confocal analysis using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope and a ×40 objective. Transfection and Promoter Assays—Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For reporter gene transient transfections, cells were cultured in medium without phenol red and containing 3% charcoal-stripped (DCC) serum for 24–36 h, and promoter assays and in vitro transcription and translation and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays were performed as previously described (35Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Identification of MICoA as MTA1-interacting Protein— MTA1 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, yet the nature of its downstream targets remains unknown. To identify novel MTA1-interacting proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of the mammary gland cDNA expression library using MTA1 C-terminal amino acids 255–715 and MTA1 N-terminal amino acids 1–254 as the baits. As a negative control, we used the recently identified MTA1s variant that lacks protein-binding motifs (38Kumar R. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) as a bait. Yeast cells expressing the Gal4 fusion protein were transformed with the above bait. Screening of 2 × 106 transformants resulted in the isolation of several positive clones. Sequencing of the positive clones identified several clones that encoded the full-length cDNA of a previously uncharacterized gene assigned to chromosome 12q13-q14 (GenBankTM accession number S82447). To further confirm the interaction of MICoA with MTA1, we cotransfected C-terminal or N-terminal MTA1 constructs with MICoA and the transformed colonies showed both the ability to grow in medium lacking adenosine, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine (AHTL) and to turn blue in a β-galactosidase assay, whereas cotransfection with the control GBK vector did not do so (Fig. 1A). Because we discovered a coactivator function of this gene product (see below), we named this protein MICoA. MICoA contains a total of 378 base pairs and encodes a protein of 125 amino acids (about 14 kDa) and has an overall 23.5% scattered homology with yeast GCN5. Sequence analysis of MICoA revealed the presence of a consensus nuclear receptor binding site (NR box, LXXLL) in the N-terminal region and a casein kinase phosphorylation site (TALE) in the C-terminal segment (Fig. 1B). MICoA mRNA was easily detectable in ER-positive breast cancer cell lines, such as MCF-7, ZR-75R, and T47D but modest expression levels could also be detected in other cell lines (Fig. 1C). Full-length MICoA has been cloned into pCDNA3.1A and pGEX 5X-1 vectors. Their expression has been shown in Fig. 1D. MICoA Expression during Development—To gain clues about the possible functions of MICoA in vivo, we examined the expression of MICoA mRNA in multiple mouse tissues. As shown in Fig. 2A, MICoA mRNA could be easily detected in many mouse tissues, with the highest level in the mammary glands of pregnant mice. To get a deeper view, we further performed in situ hybridization to determine the levels of MICoA expression during embryonic development and in the mammary glands. At the 13.5 day mouse embryo, MICoA was widely expressed in various of tissues (Fig. 2B). In mouse mammary glands, MICoA expression was seen in ductal epithelial cells as well as in fat cells, whereas the expression became much stronger in the alveolar cells during pregnancy (Fig. 2C). MICoA Interacts with MTA1 in Vitro and in Vivo—To confirm the interaction between MICoA and MTA1, we next examined the ability of in vitro translated MICoA protein to bind with GST-MTA1 in vitro. MICoA interacted efficiently with GST-MTA1 but not with GST alone in GST pull-down assays (Fig. 3A). To demonstrate the interaction of MICoA and MTA1 in breast cancer cells, the ZR-75R breast cancer cells were co-transfected with T7-tagged MICoA, c-myc-tagged MTA1, or a pCMV control vector. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an anti-T7 monoclonal antibody was followed by immunoblotting with the anti-c-myc antibody. Results showed a specific baseline as well as an estrogen (E2)-inducible interaction between the T7-MICoA and c-myc-MTA1 (Fig. 3B). We explored the spatial relationship between MICoA and MTA1 within cells using immunofluorescence and confocal scanning microscopy. ZR-75 cells were transiently transfected with T7-MICoA and Myc-MTA1. The cells were grown in phenol red-free medium supplemented with 3% charcoal-stripped serum, treated with E2 (10-9m) for 30 min, and then fixed in methanol and stained for c-myc tag (green) and T7-tag (red), and counterstained for nuclear DNA (blue). As shown in Fig. 2C, T7-MICoA was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, but upon E2 stimulation it was redistributed to the nucleus suggesting that this effect is mediated by the ER, and could be blocked by anti-estrogen ICI 182780 (data not shown). Areas of colocalization of the T7-MICoA and c-myc-MTA1 proteins resulted in the development of yellow fluorescence because of the merging of the red and green pixels (Fig. 3C). Transfected MTA1 was primarily localized in the nucleus. These findings suggest that E2 signaling promotes the nuclear translocation of MICoA. MICoA Interacts with the C-terminal Region of MTA1—Next, we defined the minimal region of MTA1 required for its interaction with MICoA. MTA1 has several important domains involved in protein-protein interactions, DNA binding, and signaling (Fig. 4A). Several C-terminal MTA1 deletion constructs were generated and expressed as 35S-labeled proteins; they were then subjected to GST pull-down assays with the GSTMICoA fusion protein. Results suggest that amino acids 441–703 of MTA1, which contains one SH3 and one SH2 site, constituted the binding region for MICoA (Fig. 4B, left panels). To define the binding region or regions of MICoA that are important for MTA1 interaction, we disrupted the NR box by deleting the LSRLL motif (MICoA-del-1). In addition, we also deleted the CK2 phosphorylation consensus site (MICoA-del-2) or both the NR box and CK2 phosphorylation sites (MICoA-del-3) (Fig. 4C). Results of the GST pull-down assays indicate that MICoA used its LSRLL motif to interact with MTA1 (Fig. 4D). This further demonstrates that the N-terminal region of MICoA interacts with the C-terminal region of MTA1. MICoA Acts as a Coactivator of ER-α—The presence of an LSRLL motif and the abundant expression of MICoA in the mammary glands of pregnant mice raised the possibility of the role of MICoA in the ER pathway. To explore this notion, we examined the potential ability of MICoA to influence the transcription from an ERE-luciferase reporter system, using either ER-positive ZR-75 or MCF-7/LTED cells or ER-negative HeLa cells co-transfected with the ER. Co-expression of MICoA resulted in more stimulation of ERE-driven transcription in ZR-75R cells treated with E2 treatment than in the mock-treated cells (Fig. 5A). The expression of MICoA alone in hypersensitive MCF-7/LTED cells (39Song R.X. Santen R.J. Kumar R. Adam L. Jeng M.H. Masamura S. Yue W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 193: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) had a modest but reproducible stimulatory effect on reporter activity in the absence of ligands. This MICoA-mediated increase in the ERE-luciferase activity was dose-dependent, with the highest activity at 500 ng of DNA (Fig. 5B). As with other well characterized coactivators (Fig. 5C), cotransfection of HeLa cells with PELP1 and T7-MICoA but not vector control significantly increased ERE-luciferase reporter activity by PELP1, a recently identified ER coactivator. Because the LXXLL motif is also important for binding to other nuclear receptors we tried to explore the effect of MICoA on progesterone receptor as well as glucocorticoid receptor by using PRE-luciferase and GRE-CAT (Fig. 5, D and E). MICoA could induce progesterone receptor transactivation, whereas glucocorticoid receptor transactivation remains unaltered. Together, these findings suggest that MICoA is a coactivator of the ER pathway and selective in its transactivation function. MICoA Associates with the ERE-containing Promoters in Vivo—To directly demonstrate the potential importance of MICoA in ERE transcription, we used the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to analyze whether T7-MICoA associates with the endogenous ERE-containing promoters. MCF-7 cells transfected with T7-MICoA were treated with E2 for different lengths of time and processed for formaldehyde cross-linking. Sonicated chromatin was subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies against T7. T7-MICoA-bound genomic DNA fragments were analyzed by quantitative PCR using primers spanning the ERE present in the promoter of the pS2 sequence, for a potential E2-triggered association of T7-MICoA with the promoter of the ER target gene. Results indicated that E2 treatment triggered a significant increase in the amount of pS2 (∼12-fold more than for untreated cells) target gene promoter chromatin associated with T7-MICoA (Fig. 6A). Because MICoA promoted transcription from the ERE containing promoter (Fig. 5) and interacted effectively with the ER target gene chromatin (Fig. 6A), these findings raised the possibility that MICoA may influence the status of chromatin remodeling, presumably through HAT activity. Therefore, we next explored whether such activity is associated with the T7-MICoA complex. Immunoprecipitation of T7-MICoA from MCF-7 cells showed the presence of functional HAT activity with the MICoA complex (Fig. 6B). Because there is no HAT domain in the MICoA, the HAT activity we detected is likely to come from the proteins that could associate with MICoA in vivo. In brief, these findings strongly support the notion that MICoA influences the status of the ER target gene promoter using chromatin-remodeling mechanisms. MTA1 Represses the Stimulation of MICoA-induced Transcription from ERE—Because MTA1 acts as a corepressor of the ER pathway (35Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and because MICoA is both an ER coactivator and an MTA1-interacting protein (as demonstrated in this study), we next investigated the potent"

We have identified a previously cloned but uncharacterized family member termed Stk10, which is a human homolog of murine Lok, a serine/threonine kinase highly expressed in lymphocytes. Northern analysis demonstrated that the Stk10 transcript is present in many tissues, although highest expression levels are seen in hematopoietic cells. Due to close sequence homology to human Slk andXenopus laevis xPlkk1, two polo-like kinase kinases, we investigated whether Stk10 might also play a role as a Plk1 activator. Plk1 has been shown to be overexpressed in multiple tumor types, thus attracting high interest to its potential upstream regulators. We show here that Stk10 can associate with Plk1 in cells and furthermore can phosphorylate Plk1 in vitro. Engineered NIH-3T3 cell lines that overexpress a dominant negative version of Stk10 display an altered cell cycle phenotype characterized by increased DNA content, raising the possibility that expression of a dominant negative Stk10 may impinge upon Plk1 function in vivo; it has previously been shown that unregulated expression of Plk1 can result in a variety of nuclear defects. We suggest, therefore, that Stk10 is a novel polo-like kinase kinase that cooperates with hSlk to regulate Plk1 function in human cells.

A number of protein kinases and phosphatases play important roles in the coordination of this process. Maturation promoting factor, a complex of the serine/threonine kinase Cdc2 and its partner cyclin B, has been shown to be essential for successful progression from G2 to M phase (reviewed in Ref. 1Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). In turn, a number of other proteins have important functions in helping regulate the activity of Cdc2/cyclin B. In Xenopus laevis, the polo-like kinase Plx1 has emerged as potentially impacting this complex by phosphorylating and thus increasing the activity of Cdc25C, the phosphatase responsible for activating the Cdc2/B kinase (2Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). There is currently debate in the field whether this is an organism-specific function; experiments with small interfering RNA in mammalian cells do not point to polo-like kinase (Plk1) having a similar role (3Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8672-8676Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, experiments with Plk1 immunoprecipitated from Jurkat T leukemia cells suggest that human Plk1 can indeed perform this functionin vitro (4Roshak A.K. Capper E.A. Imburgia C. Fornwald J. Scott G. Marshall L.A. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that Plk1 phosphorylation of Cdc25C leads to nuclear localization of the mitotic phosphatase (5Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), thus contributing to its regulation in a much different manner. Despite this controversy over Cdc25C activation, it has been well established that Plk1 activity is critical for many other mitotic processes (for review, see Ref. 6Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Through a number of genetic studies in yeast and Drosophila, the role that Plk1 plays in regulating numerous aspects of mitosis has become more clear (7Sunkel C.E. Glover D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 89: 25-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monopolar spindles, misaligned chromosomes, and a failure to undergo cytokinesis are all hallmarks of Plk1 mutants (cdc5 in budding yeast and polo in Drosophila) (8Ohkura H. Hagan I.M. Glover D.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1059-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 9Carmena M. Riparbelli M.G. Minestrini G. Tavares A.M. Adams R. Callaini G. Glover D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). How these steppingstones to successful cytokinesis are dependent upon Plk1 function is more ambiguous and only partially understood. Plk1 has been shown to phosphorylate components of the anaphase promoting complex (APC),1 thus activating the complex and allowing ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis to occur at the end of anaphase (10Golan A. Yudkovsky Y. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15552-15557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 11Kotani S. Tugendreich S. Fujii M. Jorgensen P.M. Watanabe N.

In addition, a direct link has also been demonstrated to exist between Plk1 and Cdc2/cyclin B independent of Cdc25 activation. Several groups have shown that Plk1 is capable of phosphorylating key residues on cyclin B that are responsible for its nuclear relocation during prophase (15Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Shinya N. Iwamatsu A. Nishida E. Nature. 2001; 410: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 16Yuan J. Eckerdt F. Bereiter-Hahn J. Kurunci-Csacsko E. Kaufmann M. Strebhardt K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8282-8292Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, what is emerging is that this kinase may be a component of multiple key checkpoints that must be passed for normal cell division. Just as intriguing are the number of studies that have recently pointed to the large overexpression of Plk1 in tumors; correlations have been made between the relative level of Plk1 expression and long term prognosis/survival (17Dietzmann K. Kirches E. von B. Jachau K. Mawrin C. J. Neurooncol. 2001; 53: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Takai N. Miyazaki T. Fujisawa K. Nasu K. Hamanaka R. Miyakawa I.

Rubsamen-Waigmann H. Strebhardt K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Regulation of Plk1 activity appears to occur through two separate mechanisms. The cell controls the activity of Plk1 dramatically through transcriptional repression (23Uchiumi T. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9166-9174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). At G1 phase and in quiescent cells, the level and activity of Plk1 is barely detectable (24Hamanaka R. Smith M.R. O'Connor P.M. Maloid S. Mihalic K. Spivak J.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21086-21091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Golsteyn R.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Ziemiecki A. Ried T. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the cell progresses through the cell cycle and undergoes replication, the level of Plk1 rises markedly and reaches a peak between G2 and M phases. Following successful cytokinesis, Plk1 is ubiquitinated and destroyed by the same complex it helped activate, the APC, thereby returning to the low basal level seen in G1 phase (26Ferris D.K. Maloid S.C. Li C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to this tight transcriptional control, the kinase is also up-regulated by phosphorylation (24Hamanaka R. Smith M.R. O'Connor P.M. Maloid S. Mihalic K. Spivak J.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21086-21091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Kelm O. Wind M. Lehmann W.D. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25247-25256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recent work in X. laevis has provided us with the most information in this regard. Maller and co-workers (28Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) purified an activity from Xenopus eggs they termed xPlkk1, forXenopus Plk kinase, which they suggest is responsible for activating Plx during oocyte maturation. Following this discovery, a mammalian protein, Slk, which shares significant homology to xPlkk1, was shown to phosphorylate and activate Plk1 in vitro(29Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Karasuyama H. Yamada E. Tsujikawa K. Todokoro K. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here we show that another protein kinase may contribute to the regulation of Plk1. The murine gene Lok shows a great deal of sequence similarity to both xPlkk1 and Slk. We, along with another group, recently cloned the human homolog of Lok called Stk10 (30Kuramochi S. Matsuda Y. Okamoto M. Kitamura F. Yonekawa H. Karasuyama H. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition to sharing significant sequence similarity with both of these polo-like kinase kinases, we show here that Stk10 is also able to phosphorylate Plk1. Unlike Lok, Stk10 has a widespread tissue distribution, showing expression in a number of proliferative tissues as well as in multiple tumor lines. These data raise the intriguing possibility that Stk10 may play a role in regulating Plk1 in these specific biological settings. A human Stk10 clone,AA459448, was first identified using a Smith-Waterman search of the EST data base with the human Slk gene (GenBankTMaccession number AB002804) as a query. Sequence analysis of the 1286-bp insert identified a 1227-bp open reading frame (409 amino acids) with the potential to encode the N terminus of a novel human STK related to the human Slk gene product. An additional Smith-Waterman search using the C terminus of the Slk gene as a query yielded three additional EST numbers, AA323687, AA380492, and AA168869, that encode the C-terminal region of human Stk10. PCR using single-stranded cDNA from human testis and the H23 tumor cell line enabled a complete sequence of Stk10 to be assembled. PCR primers were designed based upon the ESTs recovered as well as murine Lok (m_Lok). To generate a kinase-dead mutant of Stk10, primers were designed to convert the conserved lysine (amino acid 66) in the kinase domain to an isoleucine using the Stratagene QuikChange kit (primers used were 5′-GCTTTGGCTGCGGCCATAGTCATTGAAACCAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTGGTTTCAATGACTATGGCCGCAGCCAAAGC-3′). Clones were sequenced to ensure that only the correct mutation was present. Wild type and the kinase-dead mutant Stk10, tagged on the C terminus with the HA epitope, were also subcloned into pBabepuro for stable cell line generation in NIH-3T3 cells. A Clontech Northern blot (#7780-1, 12-lane multiple tissue Northern blot) was incubated with a 659-bp fragment of Stk10 (1263–1922,EcoRI/BamHI) according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications (200 μCi of [α-32P]ATP was used to label the probe, which was incubated with the blot overnight at 65 °C). After multiple washes, the blot was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and later read on a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (0.15 unit/ml), 20 μm leupeptin, 5 mm sodium vanadate) for 10 min prior to a clarifying centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. Protein concentrations were determined using a Pierce BCA kit (Rockford, IL). Equivalent amounts of protein lysate were pre-cleared by incubation with protein A-agarose for 1 h. The cleared lysates were then transferred to a fresh tube containing protein A-agarose and 2 μg of affinity-purified Stk10 antibody and rocked for 5–16 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and three times in cold kinase buffer (3 mm MnCl2, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6). 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 200 μm ATP, and 5 μg of histone H2A were then added to each tube and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Kinase assays with Stk10 and Plk1 were washed an additional three times in a high salt buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4) before the final washes with cold kinase buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose; the membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk (in TBS-Tween, pH 8.0) and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with appropriate antibody. Anti-Stk10 was used at 0.5 μg/μl, anti-Plk1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc. or Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:1000, anti-phospho-ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:5000, anti-FLAG (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used at 1:4000, and anti-HA (12-CA5, BAbCO, Berkeley, CA) was used at 1:1000. A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was constructed by subcloning an internal, poorly conserved region of Stk10 (amino acids 352–477) into pGEX-4T utilizingBamHI and SalI restriction sites. BL21 cells were transformed with this construct, and protein production was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The protein was then purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), eluted with excess free glutathione and dialyzed overnight with phosphate-buffered saline. Naı̈ve rabbits were injected every 3 weeks with 0.5 mg of GST fusion protein. The first injection was mixed 1:1 with Freund's complete adjuvant, and all others were mixed 1:1 with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. To affinity purify the crude serum, it was incubated with CnBr-activated Sepharose 4B covalently bound to the GST fusion protein according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). After numerous washes, the antibody was eluted off of the resin with propionic acid, neutralized, and dialyzed overnight in PBS. Xenopus females were purchased from Nasco (Fort Wilkinson, WI). Oocyte removal and injection were done as previously described (31Cutler Jr., R.E. Morrison D.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1953-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were removed and defolliculated by incubation in MMR (100 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) containing collagenase A (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) (1.5 mg/ml) for 1.5 h. Oocytes were then washed several times in MMR and cultured overnight in 50% Leibovitz-15 medium (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Eighteen hours after isolation, oocytes were injected with ∼30 ng of in vitro transcribed RNA encoding the Stk10 proteins (wild type or kinase-dead). Capped RNA was transcribed using the Ambion Message Machine kit (Austin, TX). Following injection of RNA, progesterone (Sigma) was added to the Leibovitz medium at 1 μg/ml. GVBD was scored by the appearance of a white dot in the animal pole of the oocyte. Oocytes were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer by gentle pipetting through a micropipette tip and spinning briefly at 14,000 to remove insoluble material. Lysates were then used for Western analysis. HeLa, 293T, and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. HEK-293T and COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using SuperFect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications and incubated for 48 h before being lysed and analyzed for protein expression. HeLa cells were synchronized by a thymidine/aphidicolin block and then released into fresh media, and samples were collected periodically for biochemical and flow cytometry analysis. Cells were plated at a low density (5 × 105/10-cm plate), allowed to attach, and then incubated with 2 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 12 h. 8 h after being washed and released into fresh media, 1 μg/ml aphidicolin (Sigma) was added to the media and the cells were incubated for another 12 h. The cells were then washed and released to progress through the cell cycle by incubation with fresh media. NIH-3T3 cells were synchronized by a sequential serum starvation (0.1% FBS) for 36 h, followed by incubation with fresh media (10% FBS) containing 1 μg/ml aphidicolin for 16 h. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, and fresh media was added (10% FBS) to allow free progression through the cell cycle. Cells were periodically collected for flow cytometry analysis. Cells were detached with trypsin and washed once with PBS. The cell pellets were then resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, fixed by the slow addition of ice-cold 70% ethanol, and stored at −20 °C for at least 2 h. The fixed cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min and washed once in PBS. The cell pellets were then stained in 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (Roche Applied Science), 200 μg/ml RNase (Sigma) in PBS and incubated for 30 min in the dark. The closest characterized ortholog to Stk10 (sharing 88% identity) is murine lymphocyte-oriented kinase (Lok). Western analysis has suggested that Lok expression is relatively restricted to lymphoid tissue (32Kuramochi S. Moriguchi T. Kuida K. Endo J. Semba K. Nishida E. Karasuyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22679-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether Stk10 shares a common expression pattern with the mouse homolog we performed Northern blot analysis with a Clontech 12 tissue array blot and an Stk10-specific probe. As shown in Fig.1A, high expression was seen in certain rapidly proliferating tissues (spleen, placenta, and peripheral blood leukocytes), but transcripts were also detectable in the other tissues profiled (brain, heart, skeletal muscle, colon, thymus, kidney, liver, small intestine, and lung) indicating that Stk10 has a more widespread pattern of expression than has been reported so far for its mouse homolog, Lok (32Kuramochi S. Moriguchi T. Kuida K. Endo J. Semba K. Nishida E. Karasuyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22679-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In all tissues examined, multiple transcripts were observed, although we saw no evidence that different splice variants are translated. In addition, TaqMan analysis was performed on a similar set of tissues; results correlated well with that seen by Northern analysis (data not shown). To detect Stk10 protein expression, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against the internal domain of Stk10 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Given the elevated level of Stk10 mRNA in highly proliferative tissue, we examined a set of tumor cell lines for Stk10 protein expression. It is clear from Fig.1B that Stk10 is expressed in many different tumor lines; interestingly, the highest level of expression does not occur in the leukemic lines as one might predict based upon the tissue distribution of the murine ortholog. To verify the kinase activity of recombinant Stk10, we transiently transfected HEK-293T cells with DNA encoding either wild type or a kinase-dead mutant of Stk10. The proteins were immunoprecipitated using an HA-epitope tag engineered onto the C terminus, and a kinase assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results of this assay are shown in Fig. 2A. Clear autophosphorylation of wild type Stk10 as well as robust phosphorylation of histone H2A was observed. No autophosphorylation or phosphorylation of substrate by the kinase-dead mutant was detected. The choice of substrate was based upon earlier published results with Lok (32Kuramochi S. Moriguchi T. Kuida K. Endo J. Semba K. Nishida E. Karasuyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22679-22684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Unlike Lok, however, Stk10 does not appear to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (data not shown). Western analysis (Fig.2B) shows the levels of wild type and kinase-dead Stk10 assayed for activity. Slightly less kinase-dead than wild type protein was assayed in this experiment; however, the difference in histone phosphorylation between the two samples far outweighs the minor difference in expression. To understand the potential role for Stk10 in human cells, we examined two similar homologs with known functions found in humans and X. laevis(hSlk and xPlkk1, respectively). As Fig.3 illustrates, both genes have a domain structure similar to Stk10, i.e. they contain an N-terminal kinase domain as well as a coiled-coil domain at the C terminus. Most importantly, hSlk and xPlkk1 have a common function in cells; they both act as polo-like kinase kinases, phosphorylating and activating polo-like kinase. These sequence similarities raised the possibility that Stk10 might act in a like fashion to regulate the activity of Plk1. We next examined whether Plk and Stk10 can associate in cells; such an interaction would suggest that Plk is an in vivo substrate for Stk10. We therefore performed immunoprecipitations from both exponentially growing and nocodazole-treated HeLa cells using the Stk10-specific antibody we had generated. The resulting immunoprecipitations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with both Stk10 and Plk1 antibodies. The association between Plk1 and Stk10 was clearly seen in nocodazole-treated cells (Fig.4A) but not visible in exponentially growing cultures. A straightforward explanation for this may be the difference in Plk1 protein levels between the two samples. Plk1 expression is low in most phases of the cell cycle, and it reaches maximal expression between G2 and M phases. To examine this interaction in non-arrested cells, we synchronized HeLa cells at the G1/S interface and collected samples every 2 h after their release with fresh media. Stk10 was immunoprecipitated from lysates containing equal amounts of protein, and Western analysis was performed. Consistent with the data from nocodazole-treated cells, Plk1 co-association with Stk10 was most clearly visible between 10 and 12 h during G2 and M phases, when Plk1 levels are highest (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Interestingly, there is a detectable amount of Plk1 present in the lysates at 14 h when little association between Stk10 and Plk1 is seen. We cannot rule out the possibility, therefore, that phosphorylation of either protein during M phase may contribute to their association at this time. To examine the cell cycle profile of Stk10, we again synchronized HeLa cells at the G1/S interface using a thymidine/aphidicolin block. Upon release from this arrest, samples were collected every 2 h to assay for kinase activity and Western analysis. In contrast with the pattern seen with Plk1, the abundance of Stk10 did not vary significantly during the time course (Figs. 4B and5B) suggesting that the expression profile of Stk10 is constant throughout the cell cycle. Similarly, the ability of Stk10 to both autophosphorylate and phosphorylate histone H2A was relatively stable (Fig. 5A). This pattern of activity and expression is very similar to that seen with another human polo-like kinase kinase, hSlk. To confirm the potential role of Stk10 as a polo-like kinase kinase, we performedin vitro kinase assays with Plk1 as the substrate. Briefly, a kinase-dead mutant of Plk1, tagged on the C terminus with an HA epitope, was transfected into COS-7 cells. Kinase-dead Plk1 was used to avoid signal generated by autophosphorylation. Separate dishes of cells were transfected with either a wild type or kinase-dead form of Stk10 tagged on the N terminus with a FLAG epitope. 48 h after transfection the cells were lysed, clarified lysates were mixed, and the proteins were immunoprecipitated with their respective tags. After a stringent set of washes, an in vitro kinase assay was performed. Fig. 6A(upper panel) clearly shows the high incorporation of 32P into the kinase-dead Plk1 only occurs in the presence of wild type Stk10. A Plk immunoblot indicates that equal amounts of kinase-dead Plk were present in each sample assayed (Fig. 6A, lower panel). In addition, to demonstrate the efficiency of the reaction, the amount of substrate (kinase-dead Plk1) was titrated and found to directly modulate the reaction rate (data not shown). To extend these findings, we then assayed endogenous Stk10 precipitated from aphidicolin/thymidine-arrested HeLa cells for the ability to phosphorylate kinase-dead Plk1. Synchronized, G1 phase cells were used to reduce the background from endogenous, active, wild type Plk1, which could co-precipitate with Stk10 during other phases of the cell cycle. As shown in Fig. 6B, endogenous Stk10 is able to phosphorylate Plk1 in vitro, lending support to the model that Stk10 is an upstream regulator of Plk1 in vivo. Microinjection of RNA encoding xPlkk1 into immature, Stage VI Xenopus oocytes can impinge on the normal maturation process that occurs after progesterone exposure. Overexpression of wild type xPlkk1 results in an acceleration of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) compared with uninjected controls or expression of a kinase-dead mutant (28Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Based upon the high degree of similarity between Stk10 and xPlkk1, we investigated whether injection of Stk10 RNA could similarly increase the rate of progesterone-induced maturation. RNA corresponding to wild type and kinase-dead Stk10 was microinjected into Stage VI immature oocytes, the oocytes recovered overnight and were then treated with progesterone. As displayed in Fig.7A, overexpression of wild type Stk10 resulted in an acceleration of GVBD. Maturation was scored by the appearance of a white dot at the animal pole, which is formed when the nucleus breaks down and pigment granules are displaced. Oocytes lysed for Western analysis are displayed in Fig. 7B. Clear expression of both wild type and kinase-dead Stk10 is visible. The correlation of a biological phenotype between xPlkk1 and Stk10 strongly suggests the two proteins share a common function in cells. Misregulation of Plk expression in cells results in a number of nuclear defects. We determined whether overexpressing wild type or kinase-dead Stk10 could interfere with normal Plk function and thus lead to nuclear aberrations. NIH-3T3 cells were engineered to stably overexpress either a wild type or a kinase-dead mutant of Stk10, tagged on the C terminus with an HA epitope. We noted that it was much more difficult to isolate single clones expressing the kinase-dead mutant than to find wild type-expressing clones. Growth curves confirmed that cells expressing kinase-dead Stk10 grew more slowly than those expressing the wild type protein (data not shown). Given our proliferation data and the potential role that Stk10 plays in cell cycle regulation, we next examined the ability of these various clones to cycle in a synchronous manner. The cells were blocked at the G1/S interface with aphidicolin, then fixed, stained, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results from a typical experiment are shown in Fig. 8. A dramatic effect was observed in the clones expressing kinase-dead Stk10. In a dose-dependent fashion, expression of the mutant Stk10 resulted in an abnormal DNA content. At the time sampled, when the majority of each population should be arrested in G1/S phase with 2N DNA, it is clear that most of the cells expressing the kinase-dead allele of Stk10 have 4N DNA content (Fig. 8B,top panels). This effect continued as the cells progressed through the cell cycle; when control cells had duplicated their DNA to 4N, the kinase-dead expressing cells also increased their DNA content to ∼8N (Fig. 8B, bottom panels). In addition,"

Our study revealed nine candidate genes, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a putative novel secretory product of HNS worthy of further analysis. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry confirmed that IL-6 is robustly expressed in the supraoptic (SON) and the paraventricular (PVN) nuclei of the hypothalamus. By double staining immunofluorescence we showed that IL-6 is largely co-localized with VP in the SON and PVN. In situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry, and Western blotting all revealed IL-6 up-regulation in the SON and PVN following dehydration, thus validating the array data. The same dehydration stimulus resulted in an increase in IL-6 immunoreactivity in the axons of the internal zone of the median eminence and a marked reduction in IL-6-like material in the posterior pituitary gland. We thus suggest that IL-6 takes the samesecretory pathway as VP and is secreted from the posterior pituitary following a physiological stimulus.

The hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS) 1The abbreviations used are: HNS, hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system; MCN, magnocellular neuron; SON, supraoptic nucleus; PVN, paraventricular nucleus; VP, vasopressin; IL, interleukin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ISH, in situ hybridization; ME, median eminence. consists of large magnocellular neurons (MCNs) of the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) hypothalamic nuclei that have axons terminating on blood capillaries of the posterior pituitary (1Bargmann W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1966; 19: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), along with associated glia, blood vessels, interneurons, and afferent terminals. The HNS is the source of the neuropeptide hormone vasopressin (VP), which has a crucial role in osmoregulation (2Reeves W.B. Andreoli T.E. Wilson J.D. Foster D.W. Posterior Pituitary and Water Metabolism. Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. Saunders, Philadelphia1992Google Scholar). Following the onset of an osmotic stimulus such as dehydration (fluid deprivation), mammals respond to plasma hyperosmolality by reducing the renal excretion of water. Tubular reabsorption of water is controlled by circulating levels of VP. A rise in plasma osmolality is detected by osmoreceptor mechanisms in the circumventricular organs (3Bourque C.W. Oliet S.H.

Through an interaction with V2-type receptors located in the kidney, VP increases the permeability of the collecting ducts to water, promoting water conservation by decreasing the amount of water lost in urine. Physiological activation of the MCNs by dehydration results in a massive release of stored hormone from posterior pituitary terminals, and a concomitant functional remodeling of the HNS, characterized by activity-dependent secretory, electrophysiological, biosynthetic, and gene expression plasticity (12Hatton G.I. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 375-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 13Murphy D. Si-Hoe S.L. Brenner S. Venkatesh B.

At the morphological level, this plasticity is manifested as synaptic remodeling, increased direct neuronal membrane apposition and dendritic bundling in the SON, and by changes in the organization of neurovascular contacts in the neurohypophysis (12Hatton G.I. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 375-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). For example, alterations in the relationship between MCNs and glia, the extent of terminal contact with the basal lamina in the neurohypophysis, and the extent of electrotonic coupling between MCNs have all been described (12Hatton G.I. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 375-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 15Theodosis D.T. El Majdoubi M. Pierre K. Poulain D.A. Cell. Mol.

We have used cDNA microarray gene expression profiling technology (17Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 18Schena M. Shalon D.

Genet. 1999; 21: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar) to identify candidate genes that are differentially expressed in the SON following 3 days of dehydration. One of these genes, interleukin-6 (IL-6), has been reported to be involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation (20Mastorakos G. Weber J.S. Magiakou M.A. Gunn H. Chrousos G.P. J.

Metab. 2003; 16: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and therefore was studied in detail. We demonstrate robust expression of IL-6 mRNA and peptide in the SON and PVN, with significant up-regulation following dehydration. The concomitant decrease in IL-6-like immunoreactive material in the posterior pituitary suggests, for the first time, that this cytokine is a secretory product of the HNS. Animals—Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats 10–12 weeks old were maintained in standardized conditions in accord with United Kingdom Home Office regulations. Dehydration involved complete fluid deprivation for 3 days. Total RNA Preparation—Each experimental group was compared as replicates of three. For each replicate SONs from 12 rats were pooled before RNA extraction. Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and brains were removed. SONs were isolated on a coronal slice of 1–2 mm thick and then micro-dissected under microscope. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Microarray Target Labeling and Hybridization—Targets for cDNA microarrays were generated using 5 μg of total RNA from control and dehydrated rat SON in a standard reverse transcription reaction. RNA was annealed, in 16 μl of water, with 1 μg of 24-mer poly(dT) primer (Invitrogen), by heating at 65 °C for 10 min and cooling on ice for 2 min. The reverse transcription reaction was performed by adding 8 μl of 5× first strand reverse transcription buffer (Invitrogen), 4 μl of 20 mm dNTPs minus dCTP (Amersham Biosciences), 4 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNase OUT (Invitrogen), 6 μl of 3000 Ci/mmol [33P]dCTP (ICN Biomedicals) to the RNA/primer mixture to a final volume of 40 μl. Two μl (400 units) of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was then added, and the sample was incubated for 30 min at 42 °C followed by additional 2 μl of Superscript II reverse transcriptase and another 30-min incubation. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The samples were incubated at 65 °C for 30 min after addition of 10 μl of 0.1 m NaOH to hydrolyze and remove RNA. The samples were pH neutralized by the addition of 45 μl of 0.5 m Tris, pH 8.0, and purified using Bio-Rad 6 purification columns (Bio-Rad). The NIA neuroarray consists of 1152 cDNAs printed on nylon membrane in duplicate (23Vawter M.P. Barrett T. Cheadle C. Sokolov B.P. Wood III, W.H. Donovan D.M. Webster M. Freed W.J. Becker K.G. Brain Res. Bull. 2001; 55: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The arrays were hybridized with [α-33P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes overnight at 50 °C in 4 ml of hybridization solution. Hybridized arrays were rinsed in 50 ml of 2× SSC and 1% SDS twice at 55 °C followed by washing one to two times with 2× SSC and 1% SDS at 55 °C for 15 min each. The microarrays were exposed to PhosphorImager screens for 1–3 days. The screens were then scanned with Amersham Biosciences STORM PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA) at 50-μm resolution. Microarray Data Analysis: z Normalization—ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) was used to convert the hybridization signals on the image into raw intensity values, and the data thus generated were transferred into MS Excel spreadsheets, predesigned to associate the ImageQuant data format to the correct gene identities. Raw intensity data for each experiment was normalized by z transformation. Intensity data were first, log10-transformed and used for the calculation of z scores. z scores were calculated by subtracting the average gene intensity from the raw intensity data for each gene and dividing that result by the S.D. of all the measured intensities. Gene expression differences between any two experiments were calculated by taking the difference between the observed gene z scores. The significance of calculated z differences can be directly inferred from measurements of the S.D. of the overall z difference distribution. Assuming a normal distribution profile, z differences are assigned significance according to their relation to the calculated standard deviation of all the z differences in any one comparison. To facilitate comparison of z differences between several different experiments, z differences were divided by the appropriate standard deviation to give the z ratios (23Vawter M.P. Barrett T. Cheadle C. Sokolov B.P. Wood III, W.H. Donovan D.M. Webster M. Freed W.J. Becker K.G. Brain Res. Bull. 2001; 55: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Deeply anesthetized rats were perfused with 60 ml PBS and then with 60 ml of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. Brains were then dissected into 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and postfixed overnight. Following overnight cryoprotection in 30% (w/v) sucrose in PBS for 1 day, 30-μm (for brains) and 16-μm (for pituitaries) cryostat (Leica Instruments, Japan) sections were collected into PBS for immunocytochemistry. Following two 10-min washes in PBS, sections were blocked with PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). Primary antibodies (affinity-purified goat polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping at the carboxyl terminus of the IL-6 precursor of rat origin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or mouse monoclonal anti-neurophysin-II antibody that label VP expressing cells, generously provided by Dr. J. F. Morris, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK) at 1:100 dilution were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the sections in PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1% (w/v) BSA. Following three 10-min washes with PBS at room temperature, an appropriate dilution (1:100) of fluorescent secondary antibody (FITC or Texas Red®, Sigma) in PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1% (w/v) BSA was added to the sections. Sections were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After washing the sections in PBS in the dark, they were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and observed under a fluorescent microscope. In Situ Hybridization (ISH)—A mixture of the two following oligonucleotides was used for making the IL-6 antisense probes: 5′-GGG AAG GCA GTG GCT GTC AAC AAC ATC AGT CCC-3′ (nt 141 to nt 109) and 5′-GAG TTG GAT GGT CTT GGT CCT TAG CCA CTC CTT CTG TGA CTC-3′ (nt 640 to nt 599). Radioactive ISH—Brain tissue was flash-frozen on dry ice. 12-μm sections were prepared on Superfrost plus slides (BDH) and incubated with [α-35S]dATP-end-labeled sense and antisense oligonucleotide probes (Promega, UK) as described previously (24Zeng Q. Carter D.A. Murphy D. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1994; 6: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Slides were washed four times in 1× SSC at 55 °C for 15 min each time and twice in 1× SSC at room temperature for 30 min each time. The air-dried slides were exposed to Hyperfilm® (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 weeks before development. The exposed films were scanned and the optical densities were correlated to 14C standards (Micro-scales, Amersham Biosciences) co-exposed to the film. Image analysis was carried out by NIH-Image software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Quantification was achieved using 24 sections from three different animals. Non-radioactive ISH with Tyramide Signal Amplification—Oligonucleotides were 3′-end labeled with digoxygenin-11-dUTP using terminal transferase and standard protocol provided by Roche Applied Science (Basel, Switzerland). Sixteen-micron-thick sections were then placed in PBS prior to prehybridization at 42 °C for 2 h in 44% formamide, 2× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.2% SDS, 50 mg/ml heparin, 25 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 25 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 30% diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water, then immersed in hybridization buffer (44% formamide, 2× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.2%SDS, 100 mg/ml heparin, 25 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 25 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 30% diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water) containing 5 nm labeled oligonucleotide probe at 42 °C overnight. The sections were then washed twice 5 min at room temperature with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, once 5 min, then once 10 min at room temperature with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Following post-hybridization washes, sections were washed in Tris-NaCl-Tween (TNT) buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), blocked in TNB buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% blocking reagent) for 30 min at room temperature, then incubated in 1:100 anti-digoxygenin-horseradish peroxidase (Roche Applied Sciences) for 1 h at room temperature, washed in TNT buffer, then incubated in biotinyl tyramide (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) 1:50 for 10 min at room temperature. After washing in TNT buffer, section were incubated for 30 min in 1:500 streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), which binds with high affinity to the locally deposited biotin labels. Probe labeling was visualized by diaminobenzidine reaction. Finally sections were mounted on glass slides, air-dried, and cover-slipped with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) mounting medium. Western Blot Analysis—Brain tissues were homogenized in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25% (v/v) glycerol. The homogenate was then frozen on dry ice for 5 min, thawed in ice water for 15 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The clear supernatant defined as total protein extract was removed and stored at -70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein samples (30 μg) were separated on a 16% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membrane preparations were blocked in 5% (w/v) BSA in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified goat polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping at the carboxyl terminus of the murine IL-6 precursor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:100 in TBS-T, 5% (w/v) BSA. Following four washes of 10 min each with TBS-T, membranes were incubated with a 1:100,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-goat (Sigma) secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and bound antibody was visualized with the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were opposed to x-ray films, which were developed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Films were scanned (Gel Doc 2000, Bio-Rad), and densitometric analysis was carried out using quantification software (QuantityOne, Version 4.2, Bio-Rad). Identical loading was checked by Coomassie Blue staining. Serum IL-6 Measurements—Five rats per group were ensanguinated following dehydration for 0, 1, and 3 days. Serum samples were analyzed in duplicate for rat IL-6 using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biotrak, Amersham Biosciences). Statistics—The statistical analyses for both ISH and Western blotting were performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t test. Results were considered significant when p values were <0.05. Data analysis was performed using InStat program (InStat for Macintosh, Version 2.01). Microarray Findings—NIA neuroarray probes were hybridized in triplicate with targets derived from SON of control rats and rats dehydrated for 3 days. Data analysis by z normalization of the hybridization signals enabled us to identify 9 candidate regulated genes. Four of these genes were up-regulated by dehydration, while five were down-regulated (Table I). Here, we present detailed data for IL-6, a gene identified as being upregulated by dehydration. To confirm and extend the array data we investigated IL-6 expression at the mRNA and protein levels throughout the HNS, both before and after an osmotic stimulus.Table IGenes showing up- or down-regulation in the rat SON following 3 days of dehydrationGenBank™ accession no.UniGene Cluster IDGene nameUp/Downz ratioS.E.W99328Hs.8121ESTs, highly similar to notch homolog 2 (Homo sapiens)Up7.842.83W30935Hs.111460ESTs, highly similar to multifunctional calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II Δ2 isoform (H. sapiens)Up4.051.35N98591Hs.93913Interleukin 6 (interferon, β2; IL-6)Up2.60.44H45000Hs.74122Caspase 4, apoptosis-related cysteine proteaseUp2.370.47N78582Hs.50732Protein kinase, AMP-activated, β2 non-catalytic subunitDown-1.830.47AA669443Hs.334810Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF-5)Down-1.930.22AA464067Hs.6453Inositol 1,3,4-triphosphate 5/6 kinaseDown-2.031.52H98694Hs.352382PI 3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1Down-2.390.76AA668470Hs.24950Regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5)Down-2.900.75 Open table in a new tab IL-6 mRNA Is Up-regulated by Dehydration in the SON and PVN—Using in situ hybridization we have shown that following 3 days of fluid deprivation of rats, IL-6 mRNA increased significantly by 3.6- (p < 0.001) and 2.3- (p < 0.01) fold, respectively, in the SON and PVN (Fig. 1). The use of a sense probe did not give a signal (data not shown). We noticed that following osmotic stimulus IL-6 mRNA level increased only in the SON and PVN and not in the control tissues hippocampus and piriform cortex where IL-6 has the same mRNA level in control and dehydrated rats. For example, the normalized optical densities of IL-6 mRNA in control and dehydrated piriform cortex were, respectively, 1.89 ± 0.32 and 1.65 ± 0.18. In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the normalized optical densities of IL-6 mRNA were 2.10 ± 0.13 in control versus 2 ± 0.24 in dehydrated. IL-6 Protein Level Increases by Dehydration in the SON, PVN, and Median Eminence (ME)—As mRNA levels do not necessarily reflect the final steady-state levels of the functional gene product, we used Western blotting and immunocytochemistry to assess protein levels and distribution throughout the HNS. Immunocytochemistry showed that following 3 days dehydration, IL-6-like immunoreactivity increased dramatically in the SON, PVN, and internal zone of ME (Fig. 2). Using Western blotting, we have shown 2- (4.18 ± 1.06 in control versus 8.53 ± 1.04 in dehydrated, p < 0.05) and 1.6- (4.36 ± 0.01 in control versus 7.07 ± 0.53 in dehydrated, p < 0.05) fold increases of IL-6 protein level in the SON (Fig. 6A) and PVN (Fig. 6A), respectively, following dehydration.Fig. 6Western blots of IL-6 in the SON (A), PVN (A), and posterior pituitary (B). The Western blots were performed, and IL-6-like immunoreactivity was visualized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each lane contains 30 μg of total cell protein extracts.

Using double staining immunocytochemistry, we showed that IL-6 is present within most VP cells in the SON (Fig. 3) and PVN (Fig. 4) of euhydrated and dehydrated rats. In addition, the same technique showed co-localization of VP and IL-6 in the internal zone of the ME (Fig. 5).Fig. 4IL-6 and VP co-expression in the control (A–C) and dehydrated (D–F) rat PVN.A and D, IL-6 expression.

We therefore asked whether IL-6 was present in the posterior pituitary. Using immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2) we have shown that the robust IL-6 staining seen in the posterior pituitary of euhydrated animals decreases dramatically following dehydration, suggesting a release of IL-6 from the magnocellular neuron terminals following an osmotic stimulus. This reduction was confirmed by Western blotting (2.7-fold decrease; 4.84 ± 0.61 in control versus 1.75 ± 0.53 in dehydrated, p < 0.05; Fig. 6). IL-6 Circulating Levels do Not Increase following Dehydration—In accord with previous observations (25Cartmell T. Poole S. Turnbull A.V. Rothwell N.J. Luheshi G.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 526: 653-661Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar), serum IL-6 levels in control, euhydrated rats did not exceed the lower limit of detection of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assay (>16 pg/ml). Dehydration for either 1 or 3 days had no effect on this (data not shown). Microarray analysis is an approach for expression profiling that provides the means to perform parallel analysis of thousands of genes in a single assay (26Young R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 9-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 27King H.C. Sinha A.A. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 286: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 28Murphy D. Adv. Physiol. Edu. 2003; 26: 256-270Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The results provide a semiquantitative assessment of whether the expression of a gene has been up- or down-regulated or remains unchanged. As such, microarrays provide a powerful tool with which to investigate biological specimens to screen for alteration in mRNA levels that accompany, and may regulate, physiological change. Our cDNA microarray analysis revealed nine genes as being potentially differentially expressed in the SON as a consequence of dehydration (Table I). As microarray findings must be confirmed using independent methodological criteria, one of these genes, which encodes the cytokine IL-6, was subjected to further detailed analysis. Previous studies have shown IL-6 mRNA expression in the hippocampus, the habenuclear nucleus, the piriform cortex, the dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamus (29Schobitz B. de Kloet E.R. Sutanto W. Holsboer F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 1426-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and the rat cerebellum (30Gadient R.A. Otten U. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 182: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our ISH and immunocytochemical analyses confirmed this distribution (not shown) and also revealed robust expression in the SON and PVN (Figs. 1 and 2). IL-6 expression was found mainly, but not exclusively, in VP MCNs (Figs. 3 and 4). In further agreement with the microarray data, expression increased markedly and significantly following dehydration (Figs. 1, 2, and 6). IL-6 immunoreactivity was also seen in the internal zone of the ME (Figs. 2 and 5) and in the posterior pituitary gland (Fig. 2). Interestingly, while dehydration provoked an increase in IL-6 expression in ME, it provoked a profound decrease in the posterior pituitary (Fig. 2), a finding confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that IL-6 takes the same secretory pathway as VP and is secreted from the posterior pituitary following dehydration. Genes encoding secreted molecules co-expressed with VP are thought to have roles as autocrine or paracrine modulators of hormone release from the HNS, and the expression of some of these is regulated by osmotic stimuli. For example, peptides derived from VP and dynorphin precursors co-exist within neurosecretory vesicles of MCNs. Following an osmotic challenge, dynorphin mRNA levels increase in the SON and the PVN (31Sherman T.G. Civelli O. Douglass J. Herbert E. Watson S.J. Neuroendocrinology. 1986; 44: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Sherman T.G. Civelli O. Douglass J. Herbert E. Burke S. Watson S.J. Fed. Proc. 1986; 45: 2323-2327PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lightman S.L. Young 3rd., W.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 394: 23-39Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar), but dynorphin-like immunoreactivity in the posterior pituitary is reduced following prolonged salt-loading, suggesting peptide release (34Meister B. Cortes R. Villar M.J. Schalling M. Hokfelt T. Cell Tissue Res. 1990; 260: 279-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Dynorphin, co-released with VP, is probably a local modulator of neurosecretion in the neural lobe (35Schafer M.K. Martin R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 737-740PubMed Google Scholar, 36Russell J.A. Leng G. Bicknell R.J. Exp. Physiol. 1995; 80: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assay of serum did not reveal a measurable increase in IL-6 levels following dehydration, suggesting that the amount of IL-6 released from the posterior pituitary is insufficient to contribute significantly to the circulating pool. Instead, we suggest that IL-6, like dynorphin, might be involved in VP secretion at the level of the posterior pituitary gland. It is most likely that IL-6 exerts its effect in a paracrine fashion. A recent transgenic study showed that increased level of IL-6 following restraint stress were associated with an increase in plasma VP of GFAP-IL6 mice (37Raber J. O'Shea R.D. Bloom F.E. Campbell I.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9473-9480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a static rat hypothalamic explant incubation system, it has been demonstrated that IL-6 increases VP release (38Yasin S.A. Costa A. Forsling M.L. Grossman A. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1994; 6: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and that the stimulatory effect of IL-6 was blocked by cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of prostaglandins (38Yasin S.A. Costa A. Forsling M.L. Grossman A. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1994; 6: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similarly, IL-6 increased GABA release from posterior pituitary explants, but only under depolarizing conditions (39De Laurentiis A. Pisera D. Lasaga M. Diaz M. Theas S. Duvilanski B. Seilicovich A. Neuroimmunomodulation. 2000; 7: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Again, this effect was abolished by incubation of the tissue with indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase activity, indicating that prostaglandins could mediate the stimulation of GABA release induced by IL-6 (39De Laurentiis A. Pisera D. Lasaga M. Diaz M. Theas S. Duvilanski B. Seilicovich A. Neuroimmunomodulation. 2000; 7: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, plasma VP levels were also elevated during the 2 h after IL-6 injection in cancer patients, suggesting that IL-6 is a secretagogue of magnocellular VP secretion in humans (20Mastorakos G. Weber J.S. Magiakou M.A. Gunn H. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 934-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IL-6 release might also be involved in the oxytocinergic system, since it has been shown that IL-6 increases oxytocin release (38Yasin S.A. Costa A. Forsling M.L. Grossman A. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1994; 6: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have used array analysis to identify candidate genes differentially expressed in the rat SON following a 3-day dehydration stimulus. We have thus revealed IL-6 as a novel secretory product of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system, the expression of which is up-regulated following dehydration. Our study has thus demonstrated the utility of array technology for the identification of new candidate genes that might be involved in HNS physiological plasticity. In this study we interrogated only 1152 gene sequences, a fraction of the total number of genes in the rat genome. Clearly our array findings represent only a partial picture of the gene expression changes that follow dehydration. Encouraged by our results, we are currently using Affymetrix GeneChips (40Lipshutz R.J. Fodor S.P. Gingeras T.R. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar) to obtain a more complete picture of the global expression patterns in control and physiologically stimulated SON. We thank Dr. J. F. Morris (University of Oxford) for the kind gift of the anti-neurophysin-II antibody."

Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar, 2Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that an interruption in the biosynthesis of KDO leads to the accumulation of lipid A precursors and subsequent arrest in cell growth (3Rick P.D. Osborn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3756-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 4Rick P.D. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4895-4903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rick P.D.

Thus, enzymes involved in KDO biosynthesis and/or its incorporation into lipid A are considered attractive targets for the design of novel antibiotics.The biosynthesis and utilization of KDO involves five sequential enzymatic reactions that are catalyzed byd-arabinose 5-phosphate isomerase, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO 8-P) synthase, KDO 8-P phosphatase, cytidine 5′-monophosphate-KDO synthetase, and KDO transferase (Fig. 1) (2Raetz C.R.

More recently, the gene encoding the d-arabinose 5-phosphate isomerase (KpsF) from Neisseria meningitides was identified by Tzeng et al. (15Tzeng Y.L. Datta A. Strole C. Kolli V.S. Birck M.R.

KDO 8-P phosphatase, therefore, remains the last enzyme in the lipid A-KDO pathway for which a gene has not been assigned.KDO 8-P phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of KDO 8-P to KDO and inorganic phosphate. Gahlambor and Heath (16Ghalambor M.A. Heath E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3222-3227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first suggested the existence of a phosphatase for KDO 8-P in 1966. In 1975, Berger and Hammerschmid (17Berger H. Hammerschmid F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1975; 3: 1096-1097Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) reported the isolation of a specific phosphatase fraction from a DEAE-cellulose column that would hydrolyze KDO 8-P but not d-arabinose 5-phosphate orp-nitrophenylphosphate. Ray and Benedict (18Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 60-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) first purified and characterized the KDO 8-P phosphatase from Escherichia coli in 1980 but did not identify the encoding gene.In the present work, for the first time, the gene for KDO 8-P phosphatase is identified and cloned into an overexpression vector. A wild-type phosphatase that specifically hydrolyzes KDO 8-P to KDO and inorganic phosphate was isolated and N-terminally sequenced. A BLAST search of the E. coli K12 genome data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site with this N-terminal sequence revealed a hypothetical protein encoded by the open reading frame (orf) yrbI. The yrbI gene was cloned, and the gene product was overexpressed in E. coli. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity, and its characteristics were consistent with those properties reported for the wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase.DISCUSSIONKDO is an essential component of the lipopolysaccharide that is present in Gram-negative bacteria but absent in Gram-positive microorganisms. KDO 8-P phosphatase is the only enzyme in the KDO biosynthetic pathway for which the gene responsible for expression has not been identified. The YrbI protein from E. coli has been defined as KDO 8-P phosphatase based on the following findings: (i) the N-terminal sequence of the wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase isolated in the present work corresponds to the yrbI orf to which no biological function had been previously assigned, (ii) a BLASTP search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information genomic data bases using the YrbI sequence identified matches to only hypothetical proteins from Gram-negative bacteria (there were no matches to any proteins from Gram-positive microorganisms), (iii) the recombinant gene product of yrbI has a low apparent Km of 75 μm for KDO 8-P and a high kcatof 175 s−1 for KDO 8-P hydrolysis, and (iv) no other phosphorylated monosaccharide or compound tested in the present study served as an alternate substrate.The substrate specificity, kinetic constants, divalent metal requirement, as well as the relatively low pH activity optimum of the recombinant KDO 8-P phosphatase (TableIV) are virtually identical to those reported for the wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase (18Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 60-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pI values and the native MWs of recombinant KDO 8-P phosphatase and the previously reported wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase (18Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 60-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are identical. A discrepancy in the denatured MWs was observed, however, between the wild-type and the recombinant protein. The calculated MW of YrbI (188 amino acids) is 19,866. The MW of the recombinant enzyme is 23 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and 19,881 by mass spectrometry. The apparent MW of the wild-type enzyme isolated in this report was 52 kDa as determined from two-dimensional gel, as opposed to 40–43 kDa as determined by Ray and Benedict from SDS-PAGE (18Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 60-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. One possibility could be that wild-type and recombinant KDO 8-P phosphatase differ in their intersubunit interactions because one is highly overexpressed while the other is expressed at physiological levels. These differences in quaternary structure between the wild-type enzyme and the recombinant enzyme may account for the variation seen in the denaturation states under the conditions used for SDS-PAGE analysis. Another possibility could be that the wild-type and recombinant KDO 8-P phosphatases actually differ in their amino acid sequence length/composition. The recombinant enzyme encoded by yrbI may simply comprise only the N-terminal segment of the wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase.Table IVComparison of recombinant KDO 8-P phosphatase and wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase as reported by Ray and Benedict (18Ray P.H.

Open table in a new tab A close examination of the yrb operon reveals that the termination codon of the yrbI orf overlaps the initiation codon of the downstream yrbK orf (ATGA). The yrbK orf encodes a 21-kDa protein (191 amino acids). The yrbI stop codon, TGA, has long been recognized as a dual signal for either termination or frame shifting (26Baranov P.V. Gurvich O.L. Fayet O. Prere M.F. Miller W.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Giddings M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Tate W.P. Mansell J.B. Mannering S.A. Irvine J.H. Major L.L. Wilson D.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 64: 1342-1353PubMed Google Scholar). Translational frame shifting has been observed in retroviruses, retrotransposons, bacterial insertion sequences, bacterial cellular genes, and eukaryotic genes (26Baranov P.V. Gurvich O.L. Fayet O. Prere M.F. Miller W.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Giddings M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Engelberg-Kulka H. Schoulaker-Schwarz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Frame shifting events at some recoding sites yield two protein products from one orf or one fusion protein in which the N- and C-terminal regions are encoded by two overlapping orfs, respectively. In some instances, this process serves as a control mechanism for the expression of specific genes (27Tate W.P. Mansell J.B. Mannering S.A. Irvine J.H. Major L.L. Wilson D.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 64: 1342-1353PubMed Google Scholar, 28Engelberg-Kulka H. Schoulaker-Schwarz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Sekine Y. Eisaki N. Ohtsubo E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1406-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is therefore attractive to postulate that the wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase is the product of a −1 translational frame shifting event that occurred at the overlapping sites of yrbI and yrbK. If this were the case, the cell might express three protein products in varying concentrations: the yrbI product (20 kDa), theyrbK product (21 kDa), and the yrbI-yrbKtransframe fusion protein (41 kDa). This frame shifting event, which would occur under certain physiological circumstances, could be a regulatory mechanism for the production and/or transport of KDO and, therefore, would serve as a control point in the biosynthesis of the lipopolysaccharide region of Gram-negative bacteria. It should be noted that the E. coli cells used for isolating the wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatases in both the present study and Ray and Benedict's study were grown in a glucose minimal medium supplemented with high levels of inorganic phosphate to repress the synthesis of alkaline phosphatase. This phosphate-rich growth condition may have induced the production of the putative high MW yrbI-yrbKtransframe protein. Further studies are under way to distinguish between these two possible explanations as well as other possible scenarios for the observed discrepancies in the denatured MWs.Based on the biochemical characteristics presented here, KDO 8-P phosphatase can be classified as a specific, low molecular weight acid phosphatase. Amino acid sequence homology analysis has also been utilized to classify phosphatase families (30Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 31Thaller M.C. Schippa S. Rossolini G.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Such analysis places KDO 8-P phosphatase into the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases. This family is comprised of haloacid dehalogenases, epoxide hydrolases, ATPases, phosphomutases, and a variety of phosphatases, including phosphoserine phosphatase, phosphoglycolate phosphatase, sucrose-6F-phosphate phosphohydrolase, and trehalose-6-phosphatase (32Aravind L.

Hatch M.D. Heldt H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12914-12919Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). KDO 8-P phosphatase, the translated YrbI orf, shares the three highly conserved motifs generally observed in this superfamily of enzymes (32Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 34Ridder I.S. Dijkstra B.W. Biochem.

Although the overall sequence similarity between members of the HAD superfamily is generally low, a comparison of the structures of several members of the family demonstrates a conserved fold and suggests that enzymes in this superfamily most likely evolved from a common ancestor (37Selengut J.D.

An additional signature sequence motif (GGXGAXRE), unique to the KDO 8-P phosphatase-like sequences identified in the gene data bank, is located in the C-terminal region (Fig. 6). Whether this signature sequence plays a role in structure and function unique to KDO 8-P phosphatases remains to be determined.Figure 6Alignment of KDO 8-P phosphatase-like sequences.

(38Parsons J.F. Lim K. Tempczyk A. Krajewski W. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins. 2002; 46: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) published the crystal structure of the YrbI protein fromHaemophilus influenzae (HI1679, MWcal = 19,432) solved to 1.67-Å resolution. The H. influenzae YrbI was tetrameric, and the monomer subunits exhibited an α/β-hydrolase fold. The active site of each monomer was located at the subunit interface. The active site was formed mainly by the three conserved motifs characteristic of the HAD superfamily to which KDO 8-P phosphatase belongs. A cobalt ion, used for crystallization, was coordinated at each of the four active sites. Based on structural and sequence analysis as well as enzymatic assays, the authors tentatively assigned the function of the protein to be that of a small molecule phosphatase. Although the true physiological substrate of their phosphatase was not identified, the authors correctly predicted YrbI to be the sugar phosphatase. The H. influenzae and E. coli YrbI are 39% identical; thus, the present study not only confirms their prediction that the H. influenzae YrbI is a phosphatase but also suggests the substrate for their enzyme.In summary, the E. coli yrbI orf encodes for the protein KDO 8-P phosphatase. This is the first characterized gene in the yrb operon in E. coli and may help provide a clue to the function of other gene products in this operon. Further studies on this enzyme may provide useful information in the study of the evolution and structure/function of the entire HAD superfamily of enzymes. Additional experiments are in progress to better understand the discrepancies between the MWs of the recombinant and wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatases. Based on the importance of KDO in the lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway, inhibition of KDO 8-P phosphatase will present an attractive target for the design of new generation antibiotics. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli KDO 8-P phosphatase, now in progress, as well as the structure of various site-directed mutants, in the presence of substrate and/or substrate analogues, will further assist in the elucidation of the mechanism of KDO 8-P phosphatase catalysis, which will prove invaluable in the design of inhibitors. 3-Deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (KDO)1 is an 8-carbon sugar that links the lipid A and polysaccharide moieties of the lipopolysaccharide region in Gram-negative bacteria (1Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar, 2Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that an interruption in the biosynthesis of KDO leads to the accumulation of lipid A precursors and subsequent arrest in cell growth (3Rick P.D. Osborn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3756-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 4Rick P.D. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4895-4903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rick P.D. Young D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 447-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, enzymes involved in KDO biosynthesis and/or its incorporation into lipid A are considered attractive targets for the design of novel antibiotics. The biosynthesis and utilization of KDO involves five sequential enzymatic reactions that are catalyzed byd-arabinose 5-phosphate isomerase, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO 8-P) synthase, KDO 8-P phosphatase, cytidine 5′-monophosphate-KDO synthetase, and KDO transferase (Fig. 1) (2Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). During the past two decades, the genes responsible for the expression of KDO 8-P synthase (6Radaev S. Dastidar P.

More recently, the gene encoding the d-arabinose 5-phosphate isomerase (KpsF) from Neisseria meningitides was identified by Tzeng et al. (15Tzeng Y.L. Datta A. Strole C. Kolli V.S. Birck M.R.

KDO 8-P phosphatase, therefore, remains the last enzyme in the lipid A-KDO pathway for which a gene has not been assigned. KDO 8-P phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of KDO 8-P to KDO and inorganic phosphate. Gahlambor and Heath (16Ghalambor M.A. Heath E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3222-3227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first suggested the existence of a phosphatase for KDO 8-P in 1966. In 1975, Berger and Hammerschmid (17Berger H. Hammerschmid F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1975; 3: 1096-1097Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) reported the isolation of a specific phosphatase fraction from a DEAE-cellulose column that would hydrolyze KDO 8-P but not d-arabinose 5-phosphate orp-nitrophenylphosphate. Ray and Benedict (18Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 60-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) first purified and characterized the KDO 8-P phosphatase from Escherichia coli in 1980 but did not identify the encoding gene. In the present work, for the first time, the gene for KDO 8-P phosphatase is identified and cloned into an overexpression vector. A wild-type phosphatase that specifically hydrolyzes KDO 8-P to KDO and inorganic phosphate was isolated and N-terminally sequenced. A BLAST search of the E. coli K12 genome data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site with this N-terminal sequence revealed a hypothetical protein encoded by the open reading frame (orf) yrbI. The yrbI gene was cloned, and the gene product was overexpressed in E. coli. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity, and its characteristics were consistent with those properties reported for the wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase. DISCUSSIONKDO is an essential component of the lipopolysaccharide that is present in Gram-negative bacteria but absent in Gram-positive microorganisms. KDO 8-P phosphatase is the only enzyme in the KDO biosynthetic pathway for which the gene responsible for expression has not been identified. The YrbI protein from E. coli has been defined as KDO 8-P phosphatase based on the following findings: (i) the N-terminal sequence of the wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase isolated in the present work corresponds to the yrbI orf to which no biological function had been previously assigned, (ii) a BLASTP search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information genomic data bases using the YrbI sequence identified matches to only hypothetical proteins from Gram-negative bacteria (there were no matches to any proteins from Gram-positive microorganisms), (iii) the recombinant gene product of yrbI has a low apparent Km of 75 μm for KDO 8-P and a high kcatof 175 s−1 for KDO 8-P hydrolysis, and (iv) no other phosphorylated monosaccharide or compound tested in the present study served as an alternate substrate.The substrate specificity, kinetic constants, divalent metal requirement, as well as the relatively low pH activity optimum of the recombinant KDO 8-P phosphatase (TableIV) are virtually identical to those reported for the wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase (18Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 60-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pI values and the native MWs of recombinant KDO 8-P phosphatase and the previously reported wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase (18Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 60-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are identical. A discrepancy in the denatured MWs was observed, however, between the wild-type and the recombinant protein. The calculated MW of YrbI (188 amino acids) is 19,866. The MW of the recombinant enzyme is 23 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and 19,881 by mass spectrometry. The apparent MW of the wild-type enzyme isolated in this report was 52 kDa as determined from two-dimensional gel, as opposed to 40–43 kDa as determined by Ray and Benedict from SDS-PAGE (18Ray P.H. Benedict C.D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 142: 60-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. One possibility could be that wild-type and recombinant KDO 8-P phosphatase differ in their intersubunit interactions because one is highly overexpressed while the other is expressed at physiological levels. These differences in quaternary structure between the wild-type enzyme and the recombinant enzyme may account for the variation seen in the denaturation states under the conditions used for SDS-PAGE analysis. Another possibility could be that the wild-type and recombinant KDO 8-P phosphatases actually differ in their amino acid sequence length/composition. The recombinant enzyme encoded by yrbI may simply comprise only the N-terminal segment of the wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase.Table IVComparison of recombinant KDO 8-P phosphatase and wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase as reported by Ray and Benedict (18Ray P.H.

Open table in a new tab A close examination of the yrb operon reveals that the termination codon of the yrbI orf overlaps the initiation codon of the downstream yrbK orf (ATGA). The yrbK orf encodes a 21-kDa protein (191 amino acids). The yrbI stop codon, TGA, has long been recognized as a dual signal for either termination or frame shifting (26Baranov P.V. Gurvich O.L. Fayet O. Prere M.F. Miller W.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Giddings M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Tate W.P. Mansell J.B. Mannering S.A. Irvine J.H. Major L.L. Wilson D.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 64: 1342-1353PubMed Google Scholar). Translational frame shifting has been observed in retroviruses, retrotransposons, bacterial insertion sequences, bacterial cellular genes, and eukaryotic genes (26Baranov P.V. Gurvich O.L. Fayet O. Prere M.F. Miller W.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Giddings M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Engelberg-Kulka H. Schoulaker-Schwarz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Frame shifting events at some recoding sites yield two protein products from one orf or one fusion protein in which the N- and C-terminal regions are encoded by two overlapping orfs, respectively. In some instances, this process serves as a control mechanism for the expression of specific genes (27Tate W.P. Mansell J.B. Mannering S.A. Irvine J.H. Major L.L. Wilson D.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 64: 1342-1353PubMed Google Scholar, 28Engelberg-Kulka H. Schoulaker-Schwarz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Sekine Y. Eisaki N. Ohtsubo E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1406-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is therefore attractive to postulate that the wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatase is the product of a −1 translational frame shifting event that occurred at the overlapping sites of yrbI and yrbK. If this were the case, the cell might express three protein products in varying concentrations: the yrbI product (20 kDa), theyrbK product (21 kDa), and the yrbI-yrbKtransframe fusion protein (41 kDa). This frame shifting event, which would occur under certain physiological circumstances, could be a regulatory mechanism for the production and/or transport of KDO and, therefore, would serve as a control point in the biosynthesis of the lipopolysaccharide region of Gram-negative bacteria. It should be noted that the E. coli cells used for isolating the wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatases in both the present study and Ray and Benedict's study were grown in a glucose minimal medium supplemented with high levels of inorganic phosphate to repress the synthesis of alkaline phosphatase. This phosphate-rich growth condition may have induced the production of the putative high MW yrbI-yrbKtransframe protein. Further studies are under way to distinguish between these two possible explanations as well as other possible scenarios for the observed discrepancies in the denatured MWs.Based on the biochemical characteristics presented here, KDO 8-P phosphatase can be classified as a specific, low molecular weight acid phosphatase. Amino acid sequence homology analysis has also been utilized to classify phosphatase families (30Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 31Thaller M.C. Schippa S. Rossolini G.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Such analysis places KDO 8-P phosphatase into the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of hydrolases. This family is comprised of haloacid dehalogenases, epoxide hydrolases, ATPases, phosphomutases, and a variety of phosphatases, including phosphoserine phosphatase, phosphoglycolate phosphatase, sucrose-6F-phosphate phosphohydrolase, and trehalose-6-phosphatase (32Aravind L.

Hatch M.D. Heldt H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12914-12919Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). KDO 8-P phosphatase, the translated YrbI orf, shares the three highly conserved motifs generally observed in this superfamily of enzymes (32Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 34Ridder I.S. Dijkstra B.W. Biochem.

Although the overall sequence similarity between members of the HAD superfamily is generally low, a comparison of the structures of several members of the family demonstrates a conserved fold and suggests that enzymes in this superfamily most likely evolved from a common ancestor (37Selengut J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12704-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An additional signature sequence motif (GGXGAXRE), unique to the KDO 8-P phosphatase-like sequences identified in the gene data bank, is located in the C-terminal region (Fig. 6). Whether this signature sequence plays a role in structure and function unique to KDO 8-P phosphatases remains to be determined.During the completion of this study, Parsons et al. (38Parsons J.F. Lim K. Tempczyk A. Krajewski W. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins. 2002; 46: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) published the crystal structure of the YrbI protein fromHaemophilus influenzae (HI1679, MWcal = 19,432) solved to 1.67-Å resolution. The H. influenzae YrbI was tetrameric, and the monomer subunits exhibited an α/β-hydrolase fold. The active site of each monomer was located at the subunit interface. The active site was formed mainly by the three conserved motifs characteristic of the HAD superfamily to which KDO 8-P phosphatase belongs.

This is the first characterized gene in the yrb operon in E. coli and may help provide a clue to the function of other gene products in this operon. Further studies on this enzyme may provide useful information in the study of the evolution and structure/function of the entire HAD superfamily of enzymes.

Although the overall sequence similarity between members of the HAD superfamily is generally low, a comparison of the structures of several members of the family demonstrates a conserved fold and suggests that enzymes in this superfamily most likely evolved from a common ancestor (37Selengut J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12704-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An additional signature sequence motif (GGXGAXRE), unique to the KDO 8-P phosphatase-like sequences identified in the gene data bank, is located in the C-terminal region (Fig. 6). Whether this signature sequence plays a role in structure and function unique to KDO 8-P phosphatases remains to be determined. During the completion of this study, Parsons et al. (38Parsons J.F. Lim K. Tempczyk A. Krajewski W. Eisenstein E. Herzberg O. Proteins. 2002; 46: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) published the crystal structure of the YrbI protein fromHaemophilus influenzae (HI1679, MWcal = 19,432) solved to 1.67-Å resolution. The H. influenzae YrbI was tetrameric, and the monomer subunits exhibited an α/β-hydrolase fold. The active site of each monomer was located at the subunit interface. The active site was formed mainly by the three conserved motifs characteristic of the HAD superfamily to which KDO 8-P phosphatase belongs. A cobalt ion, used for crystallization, was coordinated at each of the four active sites. Based on structural and sequence analysis as well as enzymatic assays, the authors tentatively assigned the function of the protein to be that of a small molecule phosphatase. Although the true physiological substrate of their phosphatase was not identified, the authors correctly predicted YrbI to be the sugar phosphatase. The H. influenzae and E. coli YrbI are 39% identical; thus, the present study not only confirms their prediction that the H. influenzae YrbI is a phosphatase but also suggests the substrate for their enzyme. In summary, the E. coli yrbI orf encodes for the protein KDO 8-P phosphatase. This is the first characterized gene in the yrb operon in E. coli and may help provide a clue to the function of other gene products in this operon. Further studies on this enzyme may provide useful information in the study of the evolution and structure/function of the entire HAD superfamily of enzymes. Additional experiments are in progress to better understand the discrepancies between the MWs of the recombinant and wild-type KDO 8-P phosphatases. Based on the importance of KDO in the lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway, inhibition of KDO 8-P phosphatase will present an attractive target for the design of new generation antibiotics. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli KDO 8-P phosphatase, now in progress, as well as the structure of various site-directed mutants, in the presence of substrate and/or substrate analogues, will further assist in the elucidation of the mechanism of KDO 8-P phosphatase catalysis, which will prove invaluable in the design of inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2049100592,"Alterations of cytokine responses are thought to favor the establishment of persistent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, enhancing the risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Expression of the HCV core (C) protein modulates transcription of the IL-2 promoter in T lymphocytes by activating the nuclear factor of activated T lymphocyte (NFAT) pathway. Here we report on the effect of HCV C on Ca2+ signaling, which is essential for activation of NFAT. Expression of HCV C correlated with increased levels of cytosolic Ca2+ and spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in transfected Jurkat cells. Triggering of the T-cell receptor induced a prolonged Ca2+ response characterized by vigorous high frequent oscillations in a high proportion of the responding cells. This was associated with decreased sizes and accelerated emptying of the intracellular calcium stores. The effect of HCV C on calcium mobilization was not dependent on phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma) activity or increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production and did not require functional IP3 receptors, suggesting that insertion of the viral protein in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane may be sufficient to promote Ca2+ leakage with dramatic downstream consequences on the magnitude and duration of the response. Our data suggest that expression of HCV C in infected T lymphocytes may contribute to the establishment of persistent infections by inducing Ca2+ oscillations that regulate both the efficacy and information content of Ca2+ signals and are ultimately responsible for induction of gene expression and functional differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2077856904,"Temperature directly controls functional properties of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system. The rate of the high to low affinity conversion of DnaK shows a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence and above ∼40 °C even decreases. In the same temperature range, the ADP/ATP exchange factor GrpE undergoes an extensive, fully reversible thermal transition (Grimshaw, J. P. A., Jelesarov, I., Schönfeld, H. J., and Christen, P. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 6098–6104). To show that this transition underlies the thermal regulation of the chaperone system, we introduced an intersubunit disulfide bond into the paired long helices of the GrpE dimer. The transition was absent in disulfide-linked GrpE R40C but was restored by reduction. With disulfide-stabilized GrpE, the rate of ADP/ATP exchange and conversion of DnaK from its ADP-liganded high affinity R state to the ATP-liganded low affinity T state continuously increased with increasing temperature. With reduced GrpE R40C, the conversion became slower at temperatures >40 °C, as observed with wild-type GrpE. Thus, the long helix pair in the GrpE dimer acts as a thermosensor that, by decreasing its ADP/ATP exchange activity, induces a shift of the DnaK·substrate complexes toward the high affinity R state and in this way adapts the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system to heat shock conditions. Temperature directly controls functional properties of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system. The rate of the high to low affinity conversion of DnaK shows a non-Arrhenius temperature dependence and above ∼40 °C even decreases.

Cells respond to an increase in temperature by increased synthesis of heat shock proteins (Hsps). 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; MABA-ADP, N8-(4-N′-methylanthraniloylaminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine 5′-diphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; MABA-ADP, N8-(4-N′-methylanthraniloylaminobutyl)-8-aminoadenosine 5′-diphosphate.

DnaK alternates between two states, the ATP-liganded low affinity T state with fast binding and release of the substrate and the ADP-liganded high affinity R state with slow kinetics. A substrate is first bound by T state DnaK, which is then converted to the high affinity R state through DnaJ-triggered hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP. With the assistance of GrpE, which serves as an ADP/ATP exchange factor, DnaK is reconverted from the R state into the low affinity T state, releasing the substrate. Heat shock proteins, by definition, are induced by a heat shock, i.e. a transient increase in temperature enhances the expression level of chaperones and co-chaperones. The transcription of the genes of DnaK and its co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE is controlled by the initiation factor σ32 of RNA polymerase (for a recent review, see Ref. 13Arsène F. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2000; 55: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Recently, we have investigated the direct effect of elevated temperatures on the isolated DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system. GrpE, which is an elongated homodimer both in solution (14Schönfeld H.J. Behlke J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 269-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Schönfeld H.J. Schmidt D. Schröder H. Bukau B. J. Biol.

Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), has been found to undergo two well separated temperature-induced conformational transitions with midpoints at ∼48 and 75–80 °C as evident from circular dichroism measurements and differential scanning calorimetry (17Grimshaw J.P.A. Jelesarov I. Schönfeld H.J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6098-6104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The first transition, which occurs in the physiological temperature range, has proven to be fully reversible. A similar study of the nucleotide exchange factor from Thermus thermophilus, has confirmed the occurrence of a reversible thermal transition in GrpE (18Groemping Y. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The low temperature transition has been tentatively ascribed to different parts of GrpE. In GrpE from T. thermophilus, the first transition (at 90 °C) was attributed to the β-domain (Fig. 1 and Ref. 18Groemping Y. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); in the case of E. coli GrpE, based on truncation experiments that decrease the stability of the GrpE dimer, the low temperature transition was ascribed to the long helix pair (Fig. 1 and Ref. 19Gelinas A.D. Langsetmo K. Toth J. Bethoney K.A. Stafford W.F. Harrison C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reversible low temperature conformational transition appears to be of functional importance (17Grimshaw J.P.A. Jelesarov I. Schönfeld H.J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6098-6104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The transition correlates with a negative deviation from Arrhenius temperature dependence of the rate of the R → T conversion, the deviation continuously widening with increasing temperature. However, the structural transition and the functional changes have not been linked conclusively. Here, we have stabilized the paired NH2-terminal long helices in the GrpE dimer by introducing an intersubunit disulfide bond at the NH2-terminal end of the long helices (R40C; Fig. 1). Our results show that GrpE, in particular its pair of long helices (residues 40–87), acts as a thermosensor in the temperature-dependent tuning of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE heat shock system. Materials—The R40C mutation was introduced into the vector carrying the gene of wild-type GrpE (15Schönfeld H.J. Schmidt D. Schröder H. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2183-2189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the primer pairs 5′-GCTTCTGCTGAGTGCGTGGATCCGCGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCGCGGATCCACGCACTCAGCAGAAGC-3′ for the introduction of the Q36C mutation, 5′-GCAGGTGGATCCGTGCGATGAAAAAGTTGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCAACTTTTTCATCGCACGGATCCACCTGC-3′ for the R40C mutation, and 5′-GCCCAGACCCGTTGCCGTGACGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCGTCACGGCAACGGGTCTGGGC-3′ for the E58C mutation (replacements are underlined). GrpE was prepared as described elsewhere (15Schönfeld H.J. Schmidt D. Schröder H. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2183-2189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Caspers P. Stieger M. Burn P. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 40: 635-644PubMed Google Scholar). Nonreducing buffers were used to purify GrpE Q36C, GrpE R40C, and GrpE E58C. The yield of the preparations was ∼130 mg protein/liter of cell culture. The disulfide-linked dimer was formed through air oxidation at a concentration of 250 μm GrpE in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.5, for ∼10 h at 25 °C. For circular dichroism measurements and differential scanning calorimetry, GrpE was dialyzed against 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, for 18 h. To reduce GrpE R40C, 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol was added to the buffer 1 h before starting the experiment. The concentration of GrpE was determined photometrically with a molar absorption coefficient of ϵ279 = 2,720 m–1 cm–1. Throughout this report concentrations of GrpE refer to the monomer. DnaK was purified as described (7Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 11Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A.

Biochem. 1996; 237: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Its concentration was determined photometrically with a molar absorption coefficient of ϵ280 = 14,500 m–1 cm–1 (22Hellebust H. Uhlen M. Enfors S.O. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5030-5034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the proteins were confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Peptide ala-p5 (ALLLSAPRR) is a high affinity ligand for DnaK and was synthesized as described elsewhere (11Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). MABA-ADP was a gift from Dr. J. Reinstein (Max Planck Institut für Molekulare Physiologie, Dortmund, Germany) and had been synthesized as described elsewhere (10Theyssen H. Schuster H.P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A fresh ATP stock solution (50 mm disodium salt, pH 7.0; Fluka) in assay buffer was prepared before every experimental series. Electrophoresis—The formation of the disulfide bond in GrpE R40C dimers was examined by electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). The GrpE samples were prepared in nonreducing buffer and, as a control, in reducing buffer. The SDS-PAGE broad range molecular weight standard (Bio-Rad) was used. Circular Dichroism Measurements—Circular dichroism was measured with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) using a thermostated cuvette with a 1- or 0.2-mm path length. The temperature was controlled with a programmable water bath. At fixed temperatures, four spectra between 250 and 185 nm (band pass, 2 nm) were recorded at a scan rate of 5 nm min–1 and averaged. The time course of temperature-induced conformational changes was followed by continuously monitoring the ellipticity at 222 nm (band pass, 2 nm) at a scan rate of 1 °C min–1. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—A VP-DSC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) equipped with twin coin-shaped cells of 0.52-ml volume was used. Technical details and performance of the instrument have been described elsewhere (24Plotnikov V.V. Brandts J.M. Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The protein was dialyzed for 18 h against the same batch of buffer that was used to establish the base line (25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0). Instead of degassing the sample, two successive prescan cycles of heating and rapid cooling were performed between 5 and 35 °C. The scanning rate was 1 °C min–1. The data were corrected for the buffer-buffer base line and normalized for the concentration. Fast Kinetics Measurements—An Applied Photophysics SX18 MV stopped flow apparatus served to record changes in intrinsic fluorescence of DnaK (excitation at 290 nm; band pass, 4.5 nm; emission high pass filter, 320 nm) or changes in the fluorescence of MABA-ADP (excitation at 360 nm; band pass, 9 nm; emission high pass filter, 455 nm). The temperature was controlled with a water bath. The instrument was equilibrated at the respective temperature (± 0.5 °C) for at least 3 min before starting the measurements. ADP/Pi and MABA-ADP were preincubated with DnaK for at least 1 h at ambient temperature. All of the experiments were performed in assay buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) and were started by mixing equal volumes of the two reaction solutions (70 μl each). At each temperature, at least three measurements were performed. The reaction progress curves were fitted exponentially; the standard error of the rate determinations was 1–8%. Modeling of GrpE R40C—Missing side chains and valences were introduced to the set of coordinates of the crystal structure of the GrpE dimer (Fig. 1; Protein Data Bank entry 1DKG; Ref. 16Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) with the Insight II software package (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Replacement sites for cysteines were selected with the criteria of appropriate Cα-Cα distances and Cα-Cβ orientations. At the NH2-terminal end of the pair of long helices, Arg40 was replaced with a cysteine residue in each molecule, and the two helices of the GrpE dimer were connected with a disulfide bond. The long helices in the GrpE dimer were then minimized (100 iterations, CVFF force field, conjugate gradient algorithm; Ref. 25Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar), whereas the coordinates of residues 88–197 were kept fixed. The resulting model indicates that the disulfide bond can be introduced into GrpE without changing the main chain conformation (Fig. 1, inset). The positions for the placement of the cysteine residues in GrpE Q36C and GrpE E58C were obtained through an analogous procedure. Introduction of the Intersubunit Disulfide Bond Stabilizes GrpE—SDS-PAGE showed that GrpE R40C exists as a disulfide-stabilized dimer under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2). No species other than the dimer was detected. The formation of the covalent dimer of GrpE R40C was confirmed with mass spectrometry (not shown). Under reducing conditions, GrpE R40C migrated to the same position as wild-type GrpE, indicating complete transformation into a monomeric species at the denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE. Wild-type GrpE, which does not possess any cysteine residues, under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, migrated to a position corresponding to a monomeric species. Thermally induced changes in the structure of GrpE were monitored with circular dichroism spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The circular dichroism spectra of GrpE R40C under nonreducing and reducing conditions (Fig.3A) and of wild-type GrpE (17Grimshaw J.P.A. Jelesarov I. Schönfeld H.J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6098-6104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) were identical at 15 °C, indicating that neither the introduction of the cysteine residue nor the formation of the disulfide bond affected the structural integrity of the GrpE dimer. Analogous to wild-type GrpE, GrpE R40C under reducing conditions underwent two well separated thermal transitions with midpoints at 48 and 75–80 °C, as indicated by circular dichroism thermal unfolding curves (Fig. 3B). Similar to wild-type GrpE, a substantial fraction of helicity was lost at 60 °C, and virtually no helicity was apparent at 95 °C (Fig. 3A). The unfolding proved reversible up to a temperature of 60 °C. In contrast, the temperature-induced unfolding of the oxidized, i.e. disulfide-stabilized, GrpE R40C dimer showed a single thermal transition with a midpoint at ∼72 °C as indicated by both circular dichroism measurements (Fig. 3B) and differential scanning calorimetry (Fig. 4). The transition at 48 °C was completely shifted to higher temperatures. Accordingly, at 60 °C substantially more helicity was observed in the circular dichroism spectrum, but again no helicity was observed at 95 °C (Fig. 3A). Wild-type GrpE and reduced GrpE R40C loose a significant fraction of ellipticity below 60 °C (60% of total), which accounts for 25% of the total heat absorbed. The exact position of the introduced disulfide bond proved to be crucial for effective stabilization of the helices (Table I). If the disulfide bond was placed four residues before the helices (Q36C; Fig. 1), only slight stabilization was obtained. When the disulfide bond was close to the middle of the long helices (GrpE E58C), the midpoint of the transition at lowest temperature was at 72 °C; however, the transition was considerably less cooperative (not shown) than in GrpE R40C.Fig. 4Differential scanning calorimetry of GrpE. Wild-type GrpE (77 μm) or disulfide-linked GrpE R40C (240 μm) were first scanned from 15 to 60 °C (bold line) and then, after cooling the sample, from 15 to 90 °C (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). For clarity, the traces have been shifted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IThermal stability of disulfide-linked GrpE dimersThe midpoint of the transition at the lowest temperature Tm of GrpE with introduced cysteine residues was determined under reducing and nonreducing conditions by circular dichroism spectroscopy.

The midpoint of the transition at the lowest temperature in wild-type GrpE is at 48 °C (17Grimshaw J.P.A. Jelesarov I. Schönfeld H.J. Christen P. J. Biol.

With both reduced and oxidized GrpE R40C, the rates of the R → T conversion of DnaK at 25 °C, followed by the decrease in either intrinsic fluorescence of DnaK or fluorescence of MABA-ADP, were similar to the rates that had been measured with wild-type GrpE. The rate of the spontaneous R → T conversion in the absence of GrpE is slower by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude (Table II). With wild-type GrpE, the rate of the R → T conversion deviates from an Arrhenius temperature dependence by increasing progressively less with increasing temperature and even decreasing at temperatures above 40 °C (Fig. 5C and Ref. 17Grimshaw J.P.A.

This decrease is not observed with oxidized GrpE R40C (Fig. 5, A and B). However, under reducing conditions, when GrpE R40C is not disulfide-stabilized, the deviation from Arrhenius temperature dependence was similar to that of wild-type GrpE.Table IIR → T conversion activity of GrpE R40C at low temperatureThe rates of the GrpE-induced R → T conversion of DnaK (1 μM) at 25 °C, as measured by monitoring either the decrease in intrinsic fluorescence of DnaK or the decrease in MABA-ADP fluorescence, are given for GrpE R40C (1 μM) under reducing and nonreducing conditions.

The introduction of an intersubunit disulfide bond (R40C) into the GrpE dimer allowed us to study the R → T conversion of DnaK as a function of temperature with GrpE in either its disulfide-stabilized form or its reduced, nonstabilized form. The rate of the R → T conversion of DnaK in the presence of the disulfide-stabilized GrpE R40C dimer did not decrease at temperatures above 40 °C as it did in the case of GrpE R40C with reduced disulfide bond or wild-type GrpE (Fig. 5). The data unequivocally show that GrpE is responsible for the temperature-dependent control of the functionality of the DnaK system and that the pair of long helices in the GrpE dimer is its thermosensor. How is the melting of the helix pair communicated to DnaK? In disulfide-linked GrpE, the low temperature transition was completely absent by the criteria of both circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, the melting of the helix pair partakes in the low temperature transition, which is shifted to higher temperatures by the introduction of the disulfide bond. The crystal structure of the GrpE dimer complexed with the ATPase domain of DnaK (16Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) shows several noncontiguous contact areas, with the two largest contact areas being part of the β-sheet domain of GrpE (Fig. 1). However, contact areas are also located at the COOH-terminal end of the long helix pair. GrpE interacts with both lobes of the ATPase domain and appears to facilitate nucleotide exchange by stabilizing the open conformation of the ATPase domain (16Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). GrpE is assumed to force the nucleotide binding cleft of the ATPase domain of DnaK into an open conformation, thereby facilitating nucleotide exchange. The crystal structure of the GrpE·DnaK complex is thus consonant with our data that show the intact long helix pair of the GrpE dimer to be crucial for its nucleotide exchange activity. Melting of the helices results in a decreased efficacy of GrpE in catalyzing the ADP/ATP exchange. Melting of the helix pair might either affect the affinity of GrpE for DnaK or decrease the nucleotide exchange activity of GrpE. The latter explanation seems more likely because varying the concentration of GrpE (0.1–1 μm) did not shift the temperature at which the rate of nucleotide exchange is at its maximum, indicating that the affinity of GrpE for DnaK is not significantly impaired at higher temperatures (17Grimshaw J.P.A. Jelesarov I. Schönfeld H.J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6098-6104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recent structural investigations on GrpE and truncated derivatives thereof have indicated that the four-helix bundle may serve as a stable platform for the association of the long helices, which melt in the physiologically relevant temperature range (19Gelinas A.D. Langsetmo K. Toth J. Bethoney K.A. Stafford W.F. Harrison C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The stability of the NH2-terminal long helix pair was found to be linked to the presence of the COOH-terminal β-domains of GrpE, indicating that the melting of the long helix pair might be coupled with the DnaK-GrpE interaction, which is mediated by the β-domain (19Gelinas A.D. Langsetmo K. Toth J. Bethoney K.A. Stafford W.F. Harrison C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A structure-function study of GrpE of T. thermophilus has revealed a reversible thermal transition in the physiological temperature range of the thermophilic organism (18Groemping Y. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, in this case the low temperature transition has been attributed to the globular COOH-terminal domain, with the pair of long helices melting at higher temperatures. Although the thermosensor functionality is attributed to a different structural element, it is remarkable that GrpE serves as a thermosensor in both a thermophilic archeon and a mesophilic bacterium (18Groemping Y. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To date it is unclear whether Hsp70 chaperone systems act either by passively sequestering apolar stretches of polypeptide chains or by exerting active conformational work upon the substrate (11Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Baici A. Schönfeld H.J. Gisler S. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). An analogous mechanistic alternative is being discussed for the Hsp70-mediated import of proteins into mitochondria (28Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the case of DnaK, the kinetic data on the rates of the T → R and R → T conversions indicate that the chaperone cycle is fast, particularly at high temperatures, at which the half-life of R state DnaK may be as short as ∼10 ms (Table III). Thus, a model in which the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system holds the substrate protein sequestered for a prolonged period of time does not seem realistic. However, the increased ratio of the T → R to the R → T reaction rate at elevated temperatures, because of the thermal modulation of the GrpE activity, obviously leads to a shift of the steady state toward the high affinity R state (Table III) that amounts to a dynamic sequestering of the substrate. A more active role of the chaperone system in refolding polypeptide substrates is suggested by the fast rate of the chaperone cycle with a commensurately high ATP consumption. Above ∼40 °C, the rate of the GrpE-mediated R → T conversion decreases with increasing temperature. At folding unfavorable temperatures, the (hypothetical) active role in refolding polypeptide substrates is apparently less important, whereas the substrates remain dynamically sequestered by DnaK through an even more pronounced shift of the steady state toward the high affinity R state. In conclusion, it may be argued that in the DnaK system both dynamic sequestering and active refolding work could occur, their relative extent being tuned by temperature.Table IIITemperature dependence of the half lives of R state and T state DnaK, extrapolated to in vivo conditionsTemperatureGrpE activityaThe activity of GrpE is given as the ratio of the observed rates for the GrpE-catalyzed R → T conversion (38, 39) and the extrapolated Arrhenius rates (Fig. 5C). (obs./Arrh.)t1/2bThe information on the intracellular concentrations of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE allows only a very rough extrapolation of the T/R interconversion rates to in vivo conditions. The intracellular concentration of DnaK has been estimated to be in the range of 100 μM (40) and to represent 1.4% of the total cellular protein (41). Accordingly, 0.02% of the total protein corresponds to 1.4 μM DnaJ, and 0.14% corresponds to 10 μM GrpE (41). A linear concentration dependence for the ATPase stimulation by DnaJ (17, 42) and for nucleotide exchange by GrpE (17) may be assumed in this concentration range, together with an additional 50-fold stimulation of the ATPase by protein substrates (12). Therefore, the in vivo half lives of the R and T states may be roughly estimated from the rates of change in intrinsic fluorescence during the R → T and T → R conversions of wild-type DnaK in the presence of GrpE (1 μM) or DnaJ (1 μM), respectively (17).R statecThe relative shift of the steady state toward the R state at heat shock temperatures is a clear consequence of the non-Arrhenius behavior of the GrpE-catalyzed R → T conversion, although the absolute value is rather hypothetical.

Open table in a new tab GrpE is the only member of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system that is essential for the survival of bacteria at all temperatures (29Ang D. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2748-2755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, a GrpE homolog is present in mitochondria, where it appears to be important for cell viability (30Laloraya S. Gambill B.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6481-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Hsp70 chaperones have been divided into three subclasses on the basis of structural differences in the ATPase domain, which appear to underlie substantial differences in the rate of spontaneous nucleotide exchange (31Brehmer D. Rüdiger S. Gässler C.S. Klostermeier D. Packschies L. Reinstein J. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Only for the two subclasses with the slowest spontaneous nucleotide exchange rates (with the two representatives DnaK and Hsc70) are nucleotide exchange factors known to exist: GrpE, which is found in bacteria and mitochondria, and the Bag family of proteins, which is found in the eukaryotic cytosol and nucleus (for a review, see Ref. 32Takayama S. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). DnaK has a particularly low rate of spontaneous nucleotide exchange; GrpE greatly accelerates the exchange. Even small disturbances in the kinetics of nucleotide release, and therefore of substrate release, caused by the introduction of single point mutations in the ATPase domain of DnaK, were found to considerably affect the chaperone activity of DnaK (31Brehmer D. Rüdiger S. Gässler C.S. Klostermeier D. Packschies L. Reinstein J. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Tuning of the GrpE-catalyzed R → T conversion thus appears to be important for efficient chaperone action. The heat shock response, i.e. the up-regulation of certain proteins upon an increase in temperature, is a well documented phenomenon (for a review, see Ref. 13Arsène F. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2000; 55: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The synthesis of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE is controlled by the availability of free σ 32 in the cell, which for its part is thought to be regulated by the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system. In the regulation of metabolic pathways, a recurring pattern is the control of not only the concentration but also the activity of the target enzyme. Similarly, the response of the DnaK chaperone system to elevated temperature appears to be based both on the modulation of synthesis, which is regulated by σ32, and the GrpE-controlled direct modulation of functionality, as found in this study. It remains to be investigated whether the regulation of the functionality of GrpE, through the DnaK·σ32 complex, interlinks the two regulatory modes. Although the regulation of cellular processes through temperature-induced conformational changes in proteins seems to be of major importance, the available information thus far is rather limited. A temperature-induced regulation of the activity of transcription factors has been reported. The RheA repressor regulates the synthesis of Hsp18, a small heat shock protein. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a reversible, temperature-induced change of RheA conformation that could represent a transition between an active and an inactive form (33Servant P. Grandvalet C. Mazodier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3538-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For TlpA, a repressor protein in Salmonella, the regulation of activity was attributed to a temperature-sensitive equilibrium between monomer and coiled coil (34Hurme R. Berndt K.D. Normark S.J. Rhen M. Cell. 1997; 90: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the molecular basis of the physiology of thermo-reception by neurons. An ion channel of the TRP family has been found to be activated by heat (35Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7050) Google Scholar), and recently a cold receptor has been identified as a member of the same family (36McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D.

How the preintegration complex is imported in the nucleus remains unclear.

Active transport of proteins into the nucleus requires specific peptide signals referred to as nuclear localization signals. Although Vpr does not contain a canonical nuclear localization signal, it localizes to the nucleus, it can interact with host proteins related to nuclear transport such as importin-α and nucleoporins, and it promotes nuclear entry of viral nucleic acids in nondividing macrophages (17Fouchier R.A.

It is characterized by a flexible N-terminal region followed by a γ turn-(14–16)-α helix-(17–33)-γ turn-(34–36)-α helix-(40–48)-γ turn-(49–54)-α helix-(55–83), and it ends with a flexible C terminus (23Wecker K. Morellet N. Bouaziz S. Roques B.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Of note, the N terminus is negatively charged, whereas numerous basic amino acids are found in the C-terminal domain of Vpr (Fig. 1). Moreover, the amphipathic α helix3-(55–83) overlaps with a leucine-rich domain that contains a short leucine zipper-like motif (Fig. 1). The goal of nonviral gene transfer is to mimic the successful viral mechanisms for overcoming cellular barriers while minimizing the problems associated with the use of biological vectors. Most nonviral vectors are able to complex DNA and facilitate its entry into the cell as well as its escape from the endosome. Yet, nuclear transport remains the major bottleneck in successful gene transfer with synthetic DNA carriers (25Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Considering the karyophilic properties of Vpr as well as its ability to bind nucleic acids (27Zhang S. Pointer D. Singer G. Feng Y. Park K. Zhao L.J. Gene. 1998; 212: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28de Rocquigny H. Caneparo A. Delaunay T. Bischerour J. Mouscadet J.F. Roques B.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3654-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we have recently explored the possibility of using Vpr as a DNA transfection agent. We have found that the C-terminal fragment-(52–96) of Vpr, but not the whole protein, is able to deliver DNA efficiently into different cell lines (29Kichler A. Pages J.C. Leborgne C. Druillennec S. Lenoir C. Coulaud D. Delain E. Le Cam E. Roques B.P. Danos O. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5424-5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It was the first example of a peptide derived from a natural protein displaying such a high transfection activity in the absence of auxiliary agents. In the present work, we have determined the shortest Vpr sequence with gene transfer activity and studied the different steps of Vpr-mediated transfection from DNA compaction to endosomal escape of complexes. Dimethylamiloride, cytochalasin B, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, cholesterol-charged methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and poly-l-lysine·HBr (pLys; degree of polymerization (dp) = 180) were from Sigma. DOTAP was from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., and polyethylenimine (PEI), 25 kDa, was from Aldrich. pSMD2-LucΔITR (7.6 kb) and pAAV-NLS-LacZ (8.3 kb) are expression plasmids encoding, respectively, the firefly luciferase and the LacZ genes under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter (CMV). Human recombinant adenovirus type 5 coding for LacZ (Ad-LacZ) under the control of a CMV promoter (2 × 1012physical particles/ml; 5 × 1010 infectious particles/ml) was used as the negative control in the macropinocytosis inhibition experiments. All of the Vpr fragments used in this study derive from the protein of HIV-1 strain 89.6, which has the following sequence: MEQAPEDQGPQREPYNDWTLELLEELKNEAVRHFPRIWLHSLGQH- IYETYGDTWTGVEALIRILQQLLFIHFRIGCRHSRIGIIQQRRTRNGASKS. Vpr-(52–96) was synthesized by Neosystem. The peptides Vpr-(52–70), Vpr-(55–91), Vpr-(55–86), Vpr-(55–82), and Vpr-(60–91) were synthesized by Synt:em. Melittin was purchased from Sigma. DNA binding was studied by means of agarose gel retardation assays. One μg of DNA and increasing amounts of peptide were each diluted in 25 μl of 150 mm NaCl and mixed. After 20 min, samples were electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel using Tris borate-EDTA buffer, and DNA was visualized after ethidium bromide staining. The culture medium Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Glutamax (DMEM, Invitrogen) was supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone). We used the two following cell lines in our experiments: human hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2, ATCC) and transformed human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293, ATCC). Cells were plated 1 or 2 days before transfection to obtain a confluency of 60–80% at the time of the experiment. For experiments performed in 24- or 48-well plates, 4 or 2 μg, respectively, of plasmid DNA and the desired amount of peptide, pLys, DOTAP, or PEI were diluted into 100 or 50 μl, respectively, of 150 mm NaCl and gently mixed. After 20 min of incubation, the mixture was diluted with serum-free medium to a final volume of 1 or 0.4 ml, respectively; 0.5 or 0.2 ml, respectively, of the transfection mixture was then put on each well of the duplicate for 3 h. The transfection medium was then replaced with DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, and transgene expression was evaluated 24–48 h after the beginning of the transfection. Each experiment was carried out several times; within a series, experiments were done in duplicates. Transfections in the presence of dimethylamiloride (final concentration 62.5–250 μm) and cytochalasin B (final concentration 5–40 μm) were performed as described above except that the drug was added to the cells in serum-free medium prior to the addition of complexes (10 and 30 min before transfection for dimethylamiloride and cytochalasin B, respectively). For transfections with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) or cholesterol-charged methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD-Chol; at a final concentration of 5–10 mm), cells were incubated for 1 h with the drug in serum-free medium before transfection. The transfection experiments involving chloroquine (Sigma) at a final concentration of 100 μm were done as described above except that the drug was added after dilution of the complexes with DMEM, just prior to the addition of the transfection medium to the cells. The luciferase assay was performed as described previously (29Kichler A. Pages J.C. Leborgne C. Druillennec S. Lenoir C. Coulaud D. Delain E. Le Cam E. Roques B.P. Danos O. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5424-5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Luciferase background was subtracted from each value, and the transfection efficiency, expressed as light units/10 s/well (with 1 light unit = 10 counts), is the mean of duplicates. When drugs (dimethylamiloride, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, and cholesterol-charged methyl-β-cyclodextrin) were present during transfection, the results were normalized by a Bradford protein quantification assay. These results were then expressed as light units/10 s/mg of protein. The LacZ activity was measured by chemiluminescence as recommended by the manufacturer (Tropix). One μg of DNA was complexed with increasing amounts of peptide in a final volume of 50 μl. Fifty μl of a 150 mm NaCl solution containing ethidium bromide (8 μg/ml) was then added to the complexes. The fluorescence resulting from ethidium bromide intercalation in DNA was measured with a 96-well fluorimeter (Spectramax, Gemini; excitation 485 nm, emission 590 nm). Results were expressed as the percentage of the maximum fluorescence signal when ethidium bromide was bound to DNA in the absence of competition. After centrifugation of 10 ml of fresh human blood for 10 min at 1000 × g, the plasma and the white layer of leukocytes were removed. The erythrocytes were washed five times with 11 mm sodium citrate in Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.3. The solution was then divided into two aliquots, which were washed three times and resuspended in assay buffer with the appropriate pH (200 mm sodium citrate, pH 5, or 11 mm sodium citrate in Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.3) at a concentration of 108 cells/ml. A 75-μl aliquot of erythrocytes was added in each well of a 96-well cone-type microtiter plate containing 75 μl of a serial dilution of the compound to be tested in assay buffer. The plate was then gently shaken for 1 h at 37 °C. Controls (100 and 0% lysis) were obtained by incubating erythrocytes with 4 μl of Triton X-100 or assay buffer. After removal of the unlysed erythrocytes by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g, 75 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a new microtiter plate (flat-bottom), and hemoglobin absorption was determined at 450 nm (background correction at 750 nm). The lysis percentage is given by the following formula: 100 × [(OD450–OD750)product − (OD450–OD750)buffer]/[(OD450–OD750)Triton X-100 − (OD450–OD750)buffer]. HepG2 cells, plated in 24-well plates, were incubated for 1 h at room temperature to block endocytosis. The test compound, diluted in 250 μl of PBS containing 5 μg of ethidium bromide, was then added to the cells. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature in the dark under gentle shaking, cells were washed once with PBS, harvested with 1 mm EDTA/PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScalibur, BD Biosciences). Peptides were mixed with 0.02 μg/μl DNA in a final volume of 50 μl of NaCl, 150 mm. Five μl of the mixture was deposited onto an electron microscope grid covered with a thin carbon film previously activated by a glow discharge in the presence of pentylamine. The grids were then stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, drained, and blotted. The observations were done with the annular dark-field mode in a Zeiss 902 EM, filtering out inelastically scattered electrons for enhanced contrast and resolution. For intracellular trafficking studies, 20 μg of plasmid was mixed with peptide in a 150 mm NaCl solution in a final volume of 1 ml. After 20 min, serum-free medium was added, and the solution was pipetted onto the cells plated 1 day earlier in a 15-cm dish. After 3 h, the transfection medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% serum. At different times, cells were fixed with medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2% glutaraldehyde, harvested, and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in Sörensen's buffer (67 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and then postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated with ethanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were prepared with an LKB Ultrotome. Sections of cells were colored with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed with a LEO 902 microscope. To find the shortest sequence allowing efficient gene transfer, different subfragments of Vpr-(52–96) were synthesized, and their transfection activity was evaluated on two cell types. Increasing amounts of peptides were complexed to a luciferase expression plasmid (CMV-Luc) and incubated with the cells for 3 h. Luciferase activity was measured 30 h later. The cationic polymer 25-kDa PEI (30Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5654) Google Scholar), one of the most efficient transfection reagents, was included as a positive control. On human HEK-293 cells, Vpr-(55–91), Vpr-(55–86), and Vpr-(55–82) allowed for gene transfer levels comparable with those obtained with PEI and about 10 times higher than those of Vpr-(52–96) (not shown). On human HepG2 cells, Vpr-(55–91) was the most active fragment, resulting in luciferase levels 1 log above those obtained with PEI. Vpr-(52–96), Vpr-(55–86), and Vpr-(55–82) were at least as active as PEI (Fig.1). When five amino acid residues were removed from the N terminus of Vpr-(55–91) (Vpr-(60–91)), the transfection activity was significantly reduced, indicating that this stretch is indispensable. On the other hand, the efficiency of Vpr-(52–75), which is seven residues shorter on the C-terminal end than Vpr-(55–82), was very low. Thus, among the different subfragments, the shortest active sequence for gene delivery is Vpr-(55–82) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, this sequence corresponds to the C-terminal domain, which adopts a α-helix conformation in Vpr-(1–96) (23Wecker K. Morellet N. Bouaziz S. Roques B.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Leu60 and Leu67 side chains are located on the hydrophobic side of the helix, and it was shown that they are involved in Vpr dimerization through a leucine zipper-type mechanism. Although the replacement of these two leucines by alanine residues eliminates Vpr dimerization (21Schuler W. Wecker K. de Rocquigny H. Baudat Y. Sire J. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2105-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), it preserved the helical structure of the peptide and had no effect on the transfection activity of Vpr-(52–96) (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, DNA binding is a necessary but not sufficient condition for transfection activity of the Vpr-derived peptides. We wondered whether different structures of the DNA complexes could be related to differences in transfection efficiency between subfragments. We therefore evaluated the relative affinity of three peptides (Vpr-(55–91), -(60–91), and –(55–86)) for plasmid DNA by performing an ethidium bromide exclusion experiment. This was achieved by preparing complexes of DNA at different charge ratios and adding an excess of ethidium bromide prior to spectroscopic analysis. DNA accessibility can be evaluated with this assay because a large increase in fluorescence is observed when the phenanthridium moiety of ethidium bromide intercalates DNA. Fig.2A shows that maximal DNA condensation was reached for all the compounds tested, including poly-l-lysine, at a +/− charge ratio between 1 and 2. Moreover, no differences were observed between transfecting (Vpr-(55–91) and Vpr-(55–86)) and poorly transfecting (Vpr-(60–91)) peptides. The structure of the DNA complexes was further characterized by electron microscopy. Fig. 2B, panel a, shows that DNA complexes obtained with the optimal amount of Vpr-(55–91) for gene transfer are large aggregates, likely to contain high copy numbers of plasmid DNA. Aggregates formed with subfragment-(60–91) and -(55–86) were similar (Fig. 2B, panels b ande), although sometimes unbound DNA fibers that extended outward from the condensed region were observed (panels cand d). In contrast, a large part of the DNA remained uncondensed in complexes generated with Vpr-(52–70), a fragment that contains only one positively charged amino acid (Fig. 2B,panel f). The formation of large aggregates with cationic amphipathic peptides may be explained as follows (31Niidome T. Ohmori N. Ichinose A. Wada A. Mihara H. Hirayama T. Aoyagi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15307-15312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar): positive charged residues in the peptides interact electrostatically with the negative charge of phosphate in DNA, whereas the opposite hydrophobic side creates interactions between peptide-DNA complexes, resulting in aggregation. Taken together, the results obtained by electron microscopy and the ethidium bromide exclusion assay are in good agreement. They show that DNA compaction, even when complexes have similar structures (as judged by electron microscopy for Vpr-(55–91) and -(60–91)), is not sufficient for efficient transfection. We have previously shown that Vpr-(52–96) delivers high numbers of DNA molecules into the cells (29Kichler A. Pages J.C. Leborgne C. Druillennec S. Lenoir C. Coulaud D. Delain E. Le Cam E. Roques B.P. Danos O. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5424-5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the delivery is done is unknown. To evaluate this process, we used electron microscopy. At early times (i.e. after 2 h; Fig. 3) the Vpr-(52–96)-DNA complexes appeared as electron-dense particles at the cell surface. Then, as the duration of incubation increased, the complexes were taken up into the cell by an endocytic process. Once in the cytoplasm, the DNA particles were found exclusively within large vesicles and were no longer visible after 24 h (not shown). To investigate the uptake mechanism of DNA complexes, cells were treated before or during transfection with chemical agents that interfere with the endocytic processes. HepG2 cells were transfected with Vpr-(55–91) in presence of cytochalasin B, which inhibits phagocytosis and pinocytosis but not receptor-mediated endocytosis (32Matsui H. Johnson L.G. Randell S.H. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1117-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The results show that the luciferase levels were slightly increased in the presence of the drug (data not shown). Similar observations have been reported by others using DNA formulations containing either a cationic lipid or a lipid/peptide mixture (33Zhou X. Huang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar,34Colin M. Maurice M. Trugnan G. Kornprobst M. Harbottle R.P. Knight A. Cooper R.G. Miller A.D. Capeau J. Coutelle C. Brahimi-Horn M.C. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because we observed very large vesicles containing DNA complexes (Fig.3), we further examined the uptake mechanism by using dimethylamiloride, a compound that inhibits macropinocytosis (35Swanson J.A. Watts C. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 424-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). In these experiments, performed with HEK-293 cells, we used a human recombinant adenovirus (Ad-LacZ) as negative control because macropinocytosis is not essential for viral uptake (36Nemerow G.R. Virology. 2000; 274: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We observed a 4-fold decrease in reporter gene expression in the presence of 250 μm dimethylamiloride for Vpr-(55–91)- and PEI-mediated transfection, whereas the adenoviral transduction efficiency was slightly increased (data not shown). Thus, macropinocytosis is not an essential entry pathway for Vpr-(55–91)-DNA complexes. Finally, transfection was performed following cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane with MβCD (37Ohtani Y. Irie T. Uekama K. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Cholesterol depletion results in the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, although it also affects the structure and function of invaginated caveolae, including caveolae-dependent endocytosis (38Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). When HepG2 cells, which lack caveolae (39Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Nomura R. Une T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were depleted of cholesterol prior to transfection by a 1-h treatment with MβCD, the luciferase levels were decreased about 100-fold for Vpr-(55–91)- and PEI-mediated transfection (Fig. 4). The efficiency of the cationic lipid DOTAP was scarcely altered (Fig. 4), whereas that of the cationic lipid/DOPE formulation, LipofectAMINE, was strongly reduced (not shown). In fact, a decrease in DOTAP activity was detected only with higher concentrations of MβCD. A similar significant reduction of the transfection efficiency after MβCD treatment was recently reported with the lipidic formulation SAINT-2/DOPE (40Zuhorn I.S. Kalicharan R. Hoekstra D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18021-18028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The results show that the presence of cholesterol in the membranes is essential for efficient Vpr (but also PEI and lipid)-mediated transfection, suggesting that the major entry pathway is through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The results described above do not exclude the possibility that DNA may also enter the cytoplasm directly. Indeed, peptides from the C-terminal region of Vpr including the conserved HFRIGCRHSRIG motif (Fig. 1) can cause permeabilization of yeast cells (41Macreadie I.G. Arunagiri C.K. Hewish D.R. White J.F. Azad A.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recent results showing that Vpr can gain access to intracellular compartments independently from the infection process support the idea that Vpr is membrane-active (24Henklein P. Bruns K. Sherman M.P. Tessmer U. Licha K. Kopp J. de Noronha C.M. Greene W.C. Wray V. Schubert U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32016-32026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This opens the possibility that “active” DNA complexes could enter the cell by membrane permeabilization. Alternatively, the permeabilization activity of Vpr could be required for endosomal escape. To determine whether the membranolytic activity is required for efficient gene transfer, we evaluated the capacity of different subfragments of Vpr to lyse freshly prepared human erythrocytes. Increasing amounts of either Vpr-(52–96), -(55–91), -(60–91), or -(1–51) were incubated with erythrocytes at neutral pH. After 1 h, the amount of hemoglobin released was measured by spectrophotometry. Fig. 5A shows that Vpr-(1–51) was completely inactive, whereas C-terminal subfragments were all hemolytic at various degrees ((55–91) > (52–96) > (60–91)). This activity was maintained in the presence of DNA. Interestingly, it was strongly inhibited at acidic pH (Fig.5B). These results indicate that there is a correlation between hemolysis and the activity of Vpr derivatives as transfection agents. Such a correlation has been described for other peptides such as those derived from influenza HA2, which p"
https://openalex.org/W1974057553,"An organism's lifespan is modulated by environmental conditions. When nutrients are abundant, the metabolism of many organisms shifts to growth or reproduction at the expense of longer lifespan, whereas a scarcity of nutrients reverses this shift. These correlations suggest that organisms respond to environmental changes by altering their metabolism to promote either reproduction and growth or long life. The only previously reported signaling mechanism involved in this response is the nutrient-responsive insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor pathway. Here we report another pathway that controls the length of yeast lifespan. Commitment to cell growth activates the Slt2p MAP kinase pathway, which phosphorylates the transcriptional silencing protein Sir3p, resulting in a shorter lifespan. Elimination of the Sir3p phosphorylation site at Ser275 extended lifespan by 38%. Lifespan extension occurs by a mechanism that is independent of suppressing rDNA recombination. Thus, Slt2p is an enzymatic regulator of silencing function that couples commitment to cell growth and shorter lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W2065609541,"Sterile 20 (STE20) protein kinases, which include germinal center kinases and p21-activated protein kinases, are known to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, p38, or extracellular signal-regulated kinase), leading to changes in gene transcription. Some STE20s can also regulate the cytoskeleton, and we have shown that the germinal center kinase-like kinase prostate-derived STE20-like kinase (PSK) affects actin cytoskeletal organization. Here, we demonstrate that PSK colocalizes with microtubules; and that this localization is disrupted by the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole. The association of PSK with microtubules results in the production of stabilized perinuclear microtubule cables that are nocodazole-resistant and contain increased levels of acetylated α-tubulin. Kinase-defective PSK (K57A) or the C terminus of PSK (amino acids 745–1235) lacking the kinase domain are sufficient for microtubule binding and stabilization, demonstrating that the catalytic activity of the protein is not required. The localization of PSK to microtubules occurs via its C terminus, and PSK binds and phosphorylates α- and β-tubulin in vitro. The N terminus of PSK (1–940) is unable to bind or stabilize microtubules, demonstrating that PSK must associate with microtubules for their reorganization to occur. These results demonstrate that PSK interacts with microtubules and affects their organization and stability independently of PSK kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2072782308,"MVP, a Methanococcus jannaschii voltage-gated potassium channel, was cloned and shown to operate in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Like pacemaker channels, MVP opens on hyperpolarization using S4 voltage sensors like those in classical channels activated by depolarization. The MVP S4 span resembles classical sensors in sequence, charge, topology and movement, traveling inward on hyperpolarization and outward on depolarization (via canaliculi in the protein that bring the extracellular and internal solutions into proximity across a short barrier). Thus, MVP opens with sensors inward indicating a reversal of S4 position and pore state compared to classical channels. Homologous channels in mammals and plants are expected to function similarly."

https://openalex.org/W2065784958,"To assess the role of the T cell receptor (TCR) β gene enhancer (Eβ) in regulating the processing of VDJ recombinase-generated coding ends, we assayed TCRβ rearrangement of Eβ-deleted (ΔEβ) thymocytes in which cell death is inhibited via expression of a Bcl-2 transgene. Compared with ΔEβ, ΔEβ Bcl-2 thymocytes show a small accumulation of TCRβ standard recombination products, including coding ends, that involves the proximal Dβ-Jβ and Vβ14 loci but not the distal 5′ Vβ genes. These effects are detectable in double negative pro-T cells, predominate in double positive pre-T cells, and correlate with regional changes in chromosomal structure during double negative-to-double positive differentiation. We propose that Eβ, by driving long range nucleoprotein interactions and the control of locus expression and chromatin structure, indirectly contributes to the stabilization of coding ends within the recombination processing complexes. The results also illustrate Eβ-dependent and -independent changes in chromosomal structure, suggesting distinct modes of regulation of TCRβ allelic exclusion depending on the position within the locus."
https://openalex.org/W1991575035,"The mammalian gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) gene consists of four short exons (denoted as 1, 2, 3, and 4) and three intervening introns (A, B, and C). Recently, we demonstrated that excision of the first intron (intron A) from the GnRH transcript is regulated in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific fashion and is severely attenuated in hypogonadal (hpg) mouse because of its lack of exonic splicing enhancers (ESE) 3 and 4. In the present study, we examined the influence of intron A on translational efficiency, thereby establishing a post-transcriptional control over GnRH biosynthesis. First, we verified that an intron A-retained GnRH transcript is a splicing variant but not a splicing intermediate. Intron A-retained transcripts can be transported to the cytoplasm in contrast to intron B-containing transcripts, which are restricted to the nucleus. This result implicates the intron A-retained GnRH transcript as a splicing variant; it has a long 5′-untranslated region, as the GnRH prohormone open reading frame (ORF) begins on exon 2. We investigated whether an intron A-retained GnRH transcript can properly initiate translation at the appropriate start codon and found that intron A completely blocks the translation initiation of its downstream reporter ORF both in vivo and in vitro. The inhibition of translation initiation appears to be due to the presence of a tandem repeat of ATG sequences within intron A. Constructs bearing mutations of ATGs to AAGs restored translation initiation at the downstream start codon; the extent of this restoration correlated with the number of mutated ATGs. Besides the failure in the translation initiation of GnRH-coding region in the intron A-containing variant, the present study also suggests that the interference between mature GnRH mRNA and intron A-retained splicing variant could occur to lower the efficiency of GnRH biosynthesis in the GT1-1-immortalized GnRH-producing cell line. Therefore, our results indicate that the precise and efficient excision of intron A and the joining of adjacent exons may be a critical regulatory step for the post-transcriptional regulation of GnRH biosynthesis. The mammalian gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) gene consists of four short exons (denoted as 1, 2, 3, and 4) and three intervening introns (A, B, and C). Recently, we demonstrated that excision of the first intron (intron A) from the GnRH transcript is regulated in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific fashion and is severely attenuated in hypogonadal (hpg) mouse because of its lack of exonic splicing enhancers (ESE) 3 and 4.

We investigated whether an intron A-retained GnRH transcript can properly initiate translation at the appropriate start codon and found that intron A completely blocks the translation initiation of its downstream reporter ORF both in vivo and in vitro. The inhibition of translation initiation appears to be due to the presence of a tandem repeat of ATG sequences within intron A. Constructs bearing mutations of ATGs to AAGs restored translation initiation at the downstream start codon; the extent of this restoration correlated with the number of mutated ATGs. Besides the failure in the translation initiation of GnRH-coding region in the intron A-containing variant, the present study also suggests that the interference between mature GnRH mRNA and intron A-retained splicing variant could occur to lower the efficiency of GnRH biosynthesis in the GT1-1-immortalized GnRH-producing cell line. Therefore, our results indicate that the precise and efficient excision of intron A and the joining of adjacent exons may be a critical regulatory step for the post-transcriptional regulation of GnRH biosynthesis.

The majority of GnRH-secreting neurons are located in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus (1Silverman A.-J. Livne I. Witkin J.W. Knobil E. Neil J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 1683-1709Google Scholar). The mammalian GnRH gene consists of four short exons (denoted as 1, 2, 3, and 4) and three intervening introns (A, B and C). The translation start site of GnRH gene resides on the exon 2. GnRH exon 2 encodes a signal peptide, the GnRH decapeptide, and a part of the GnRH-associated peptide. Exon 3 and 4 encode a remaining part of the GnRH-associated peptide and the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) (2Adelman J.P. Mason A.J. Hayflick J.S. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In GnRH-producing neurons, all three introns are efficiently excised from the primary gene transcript, resulting in a mature GnRH mRNA (3Jakubowski M. Roberts J.L. J. Biol.

Several extrahypothalamic tissues also express GnRH gene transcripts with a relatively low abundance. It is of interest to note that GnRH RNA species that retain intron A are expressed in human reproductive tissues (6Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Nakayama Y. Yamada M. Cutler Jr., G.B. Weintraub B.D.

Our recent findings using an in vitro splicing system have shown that the introns B and C are easily excised from the GnRH primary transcript, but intron A is not (8Seong J.Y. Park S. Kim K. Mol.

The attenuation of intron A excision is most likely due to its suboptimal 3′-splice site. Exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) located in the exon 3 and 4 (denoted as ESE 3 and 4) and a subset of putative transacting factors specific for GnRH-producing cells are thought to be required for the efficient removal of intron A in GnRH neurons (8Seong J.Y.

Kim B.W. Park S. Son G.H. Kim K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A functional significance of the intron A excision in the regulation of GnRH synthesis is clearly implicated in a nature's knockout hypogonadal (hpg) mouse, where exons 3 and 4 as well as ESE 3 and 4 are truncated. Even though this mutant retains the intact sequence encoding the mature GnRH decapeptide and expresses a detectable amount of GnRH transcript in the hypothalamus (11Seong J.Y. Kim B.W. Park S.

Brain Res. 1985; 345: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that, in the hpg mouse, the excision rate of GnRH intron A is extremely low even in the POA (11Seong J.Y. Kim B.W. Park S. Son G.H. Kim K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that intron A can affect translation efficiency, thereby establishing post-transcriptional control over GnRH prohormone synthesis.Thus, it is worthwhile examining the functional relevance of a retained intron A in the regulation of GnRH biosynthesis. First, we investigated whether intron A-retained GnRH transcripts could be transported into the cytoplasm where translation occurs; then, we examined whether an intron A-retained form of GnRH mRNA transcript can properly initiate translation at the start codon downstream to intron A.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that intron A-retained GnRH transcripts are expressed ubiquitously in a variety of cell types and can be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. RNA splicing occurs co-transcriptionally only in the nucleus by interactions between splicing factors and the COOH-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (16Steinmetz E.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 491-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and in situ hybridization studies using exon- and intron-specific probes clearly demonstrate that intron-containing splicing intermediates from various genes are confined to the nucleus (17Xing Y. Johnson C.V. Dobner P.R. Lawrence J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 1326-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 18Zhang G. Taneja K.L. Singer R.H. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 19Trembleau A. Bloom F.E. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Indeed, intron B-containing GnRH transcripts are detectable only in the nucleus, in contrast to intron A-retained transcripts. This result is well in accordance with our previous finding that introns B and C are “consensus” introns and are efficiently excised from the primary transcript (8Seong J.Y. Park S. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1882-1895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This leads us to believe that an intron A-retained GnRH transcript works as a splicing variant form of GnRH transcripts that contains a long 5′-UTR and predominates in non-GnRH-producing tissues.It should be noted that the GnRH prohormone ORF begins at the second exon; thus, we found it worthwhile to examine whether intron A-retained GnRH transcripts can initiate translation properly. The 5′-leader sequence size in this variant is larger than the average length of eukaryotic 5′-UTRs, 50–100 nucleotides (15Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). In addition, GnRH intron A contains multiple ATG sequences and putative stop codons, although they cannot cause frame-shifted translation over the GnRH ORF. This strongly suggested that intron A might affect translational efficiency at a downstream start codon. Indeed, GnRH intron A strongly suppressed the translation initiation of the downstream start codon both in vivo and in vitro, and the elimination of ATG sequences from intron A restored the translation efficiency of the downstream reporter gene, suggesting that translation from AUG codons in intron A is involved in the inhibitory effect on the downstream start codon. Evidence is accumulating that 5′-UTRs have a profound effect on the translational efficiency because of their primary and secondary structures. In addition, it is well known that an upstream start codon can modulate translation efficiency. The presence of an upstream AUG sequence (uAUG) and stop codon can generate a short or so-called upstream ORF (uORF). These uORFs usually inhibit translation from downstream start codons, although in some cases they have been reported to be stimulative. As examples, genes such as mammalian S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (20Mize G.J. Ruan H. Low J.J. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), HER-2 (neu, erbB-2) protooncogene (21Child S.J. Miller M.K. Geballe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24335-24341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 protein (22Schluter G. Boinska D. Nieman-Seyde S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (23Lincoln A.J. Monczak Y. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9552-9560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have been reported to contain inhibitory uORFs, whereas the uORFs in the mouse glucocorticoid receptor (24Diba F. Watson C. Gametchu B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the human androgen receptor (25Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25655-25659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are crucial for the translation initiation of a major ORF located downstream.It is of interest that uORFs are found in less than 10% of known mammalian mRNAs; however, they are strongly biased toward certain classes of genes such as growth factors and their receptors, tumor suppressors, and regulated transcription factors (26Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that translational control by uORFs serves as a fine regulatory mechanism. Although the exact molecular mechanism underlying the translational regulation by uORF is not fully understood, Morris and Geballe (26Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) have proposed a possible explanation for the inhibitory effect of uORFs on the translation of downstream major ORF from the fact that the uORF itself must be translated to participate in translational regulation and that inhibition is dependent on the sequence and the length of the intercistronic region. In their proposed model (26Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), a scanning ribosome encounters the initiator AUG of the uORF and initiates translation. Upon reaching the stop codon of the uORF, the carboxyl terminus of the nascent peptide sometimes interacts with part of the translational machinery, depending on the surrounding nucleotide sequences. This interaction is thought to reversibly inhibit either translation termination or a release of the completed peptide, which, in turn, arrests the translating ribosome over the termination codon. The arrested ribosome fails to reinitiate translation and creates a blockade to scanning by additional ribosomes entering at the cap, thus inhibiting translation of the downstream ORF (26Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that the possible uORFs generated by a retained intron A could act through this mechanism, inhibiting translation of a downstream ORF.Along with extrahypothalamic tissues, intron A-retained GnRH transcripts are implicated in the mutant hpg mouse, which has a truncated GnRH gene. Sequence analysis showed that the GnRH gene of the hpg mouse contains the intact promoter region and the first two exons but lacks the remaining parts of the gene (12Mason A.J. Hayflick J.S. Zoeller T. Young W.S. Phillips H.S. Nikolics K. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1986; 234: 1366-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The previous reports have shown that GnRH transcripts could be detected in the POA of these animals by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization even at a lower level than that of normal mice (11Seong J.Y. Kim B.W. Park S. Son G.H. Kim K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mason A.J. Hayflick J.S. Zoeller T. Young W.S. Phillips H.S. Nikolics K. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1986; 234: 1366-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). They suggested that transcription could be driven by the GnRH promoter sequence to produce a certain kind of mRNA, which might be a fusion RNA species produced by the joining of the remaining GnRH mRNA sequence with another unidentified sequence. Indeed, this possibility can be postulated from the fact that a part of GnRH promoter is known to be sufficient for the transcription of downstream reporter genes in a subset of hypothalamic neurons (27Oliveira C.C. McCarthy J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8936-8943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It should be noted that, although the GnRH gene of the hpg mouse retains the sequence encoding the GnRH decapeptide and a part of the GnRH-associated peptide, no GnRH decapeptide can be detected in the hypothalamic extract of the animals even by sensitive methods such as high performance liquid chromatography coupled with highly specific anti-GnRH antisera (13Sheward W.J. Harmar A.J. Fink G. Brain Res. 1985; 345: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our recent study indicated that a majority of the GnRH transcript in the hpg mouse retained intron A due to an extremely low splicing efficiency for this intron (11Seong J.Y. Kim B.W. Park S. Son G.H. Kim K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decreased excision rate of GnRH intron A in the hpg mouse is presumably due to a lack of ESE 3 and 4, which were implicated in our previous report (8Seong J.Y. Park S. Kim K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1882-1895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Han J. Seong J.Y. Kim K. Wuttke W. Jarry H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 173: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). With these previous results, the present study provides a possible explanation for the hypogonadism of the hpg mouse. The failures in the translation initiation of GnRH transcript caused by the retained intron A might be a major cause of the complete lack of GnRH decapeptide in the hypothalamus of the hpg mouse, even though a relatively low, but significant amount of GnRH transcript can be detected in the POA of these mice. As 5′-UTRs are also known to affect mRNA stability (28Lawson M.A. Macconell L.A. Kim J. Powl B.T. Nelson S.B. Mellon P.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1404-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), something the retained GnRH intron A might also do so. As mentioned above, the hpg mouse has the intact GnRH promoter, but the mRNA level of GnRH in the hpg mouse is much lower than that of the normal mouse (11Seong J.Y. Kim B.W. Park S. Son G.H. Kim K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mason A.J. Hayflick J.S. Zoeller T. Young W.S. Phillips H.S. Nikolics K. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1986; 234: 1366-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that intron A may be contributing to GnRH gene expression via its mRNA stability. This possibility needs to be explored.It is also of interest to note that the intron A-containing reporter can lower the expression efficiency of the GnRH E1-Luc constructs in a GT1 cell-specific manner. The result suggests a possible interfering influence of an intron A-retained GnRH variant on the efficient biosynthesis of GnRH. In this regard, it should be noted that the excision rate of GnRH intron A is significantly low in prepubertal mouse POA (11Seong J.Y. Kim B.W. Park S. Son G.H. Kim K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It showed a gradual increase during postnatal development. This result strongly suggested that the maturation of splicing machinery responsible for GnRH neuron-specific excision of the intron A could occur with sexual maturation. With the previous findings, our present result indicates that the efficient excision of the intron A may contribute to the efficient production of GnRH. An exact molecular mechanism underlying the interference is presently unknown. However, competition between mature GnRH mRNA and its intron A-retained variant to the translation machinery in GnRH-producing cells would be most probable, because these two transcripts contain the same ribosomal entry sequence. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the translation efficiency for E1-Luc constructs varied according to cell type when compared with that of CTL-Luc containing no GnRH UTR sequences. The translation efficiencies of E1-Luc were generally impaired in non-GnRH-producing cell lines, although significant amounts of luciferase can be still produced in these cells. It appears that the translation machinery in GT1 cell is specified to translate GnRH mRNA more efficiently. Similar results were also observed in other genes. For instance, translation efficiencies of heterogeneous neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) transcripts were significantly affected by cell types. Even in the same cell line, cell differentiation significantly altered the translation efficiency of that transcript. These results strongly suggest that there must be cell type-specific translation machinery that is specified for a subset of gene transcripts (29Wang Y. Newton D.C. Robb G.B. Kau C.L. Miller T.L. Cheung A.H. Hall A.V. VanDamme S. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12150-12155Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, GT1 cell-specific inhibitory influence of E1IA-Luc on the expression of E1-Luc may occur by competitively reducing the translation efficiency of that E1-Luc transcript.In conclusion, we clearly demonstrate that the GnRH transcript bearing its intron A actually acts as a splicing variant form of the GnRH transcript that is predominant in non-GnRH-producing cells. In contrast to the exon 2-skipped splicing variant of GnRH mRNA, which lacks the coding sequence for the GnRH decapeptide region and its surrounding parts (30Zhen S. Dunn I.C. Wray S. Liu Y. Chappell P.E. Levine J.E. Radovick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12620-12625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), this third variant retains an intact ORF. It cannot, however, be appropriately translated because of the presence of multiple uAUGs on intron A, and it inhibited the expression of the reporter construct mimicking a mature GnRH mRNA in a GT1 cell-specific manner. These results indicate that the precise and efficient excision of intron A and the joining of exons serves as key regulatory steps for the synthesis of GnRH prohormone, thereby contributing to the tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of this gene product, and also provides a possible molecular mechanism for the absence of functional GnRH biosynthesis in the hypothalamus of the mutant hpg mouse. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)1 is a hypothalamic neurohormone that plays a pivotal role in the neuroendocrine regulation of mammalian reproduction and sexual development. The majority of GnRH-secreting neurons are located in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus (1Silverman A.-J. Livne I. Witkin J.W. Knobil E. Neil J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction.

https://openalex.org/W2030631134,"p73 is a p53 homolog, as they are similar structurally and functionally. Unlike p53, p73 is not inactivated by the products of viral oncogenes such as SV40 T antigen and human papilloma virus E6. Here we show that the product of adenoviral oncogene E1A inhibits the transcriptional activation by both p73α and p73β. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that E1A does not inhibit the sequence-specific DNA binding by p73. Transcriptional activation by a fusion protein containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and either of the activation domains of p73 was inhibited by wild-type (WT) E1A, but not by the N-terminal deletion mutant E1A(Δ2–36). E1A(Δ2–36), which does not bind to the p300/CBP family of coactivators, failed to inhibit p73-mediated transcription, whereas E1A(ΔCR2), a deletion mutant that does not bind to the pRb family of proteins, inhibited p73-mediated transcription as efficiently as WT E1A. Consistent with these observations, growth arrest induced by p73 expressed from a recombinant adenovirus was abrogated by WT E1A, which correlated with inhibition of p73-mediated induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 by E1A. However, p73 was able to induce p21WAF1/CIP1 and to mediate growth arrest in the presence of E1A(Δ2–36). Furthermore, the expression of either wild-type E1A or E1A(Δ2–36) resulted in the stabilization of endogenous p73. However, p73 stabilized in response to the expression of E1A(Δ2–36), but not WT E1A, was able to activate the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1. These results suggest that the transcriptional activation function of p73 is specifically targeted by E1A through a mechanism involving p300/CBP proteins during the process of transformation and that p73 may have a role to play as a tumor suppressor. p73 is a p53 homolog, as they are similar structurally and functionally. Unlike p53, p73 is not inactivated by the products of viral oncogenes such as SV40 T antigen and human papilloma virus E6. Here we show that the product of adenoviral oncogene E1A inhibits the transcriptional activation by both p73α and p73β. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that E1A does not inhibit the sequence-specific DNA binding by p73. Transcriptional activation by a fusion protein containing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and either of the activation domains of p73 was inhibited by wild-type (WT) E1A, but not by the N-terminal deletion mutant E1A(Δ2–36). E1A(Δ2–36), which does not bind to the p300/CBP family of coactivators, failed to inhibit p73-mediated transcription, whereas E1A(ΔCR2), a deletion mutant that does not bind to the pRb family of proteins, inhibited p73-mediated transcription as efficiently as WT E1A.

Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6670) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, mutations in p53 are the most frequently seen genetic alterations in human cancers (2Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C.

Similarly, p53 knockout mice as well as transgenic mice carrying mutant p53 alleles are highly prone to developing spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumors (4Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L.

All of them have considerable homology to p53, in particular to the conserved domains of p53. p73 produces two major alternatively spliced isoforms, termed p73α and p73β, which differ at their C terminus (6Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Jean-Christophe B. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Jean-Michel L. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). The homology between both p73 isoforms and p53 is very extensive within the most conserved domains. p73 isoforms are also similar functionally to p53 in that they are able to inhibit cancer cell growth by activating p21WAF1/CIP1 and induce apoptosis when exogenously expressed (10Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin W.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). However, p73 is also different from p53 in many different ways. Unlike p53, p73 is monoallelically expressed and is not activated by either DNA damage or ultraviolet irradiation (6Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Jean-Christophe B. Valent A. Minty A.

Moreover, mutations in the p73 gene have not yet been found in several cancers (11Marin M.C. Kaelin W.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M93-M100PubMed Google Scholar), despite the fact that p73 is located in 1p36.3, which is one of the most frequently deleted regions in neuroblastomas and other cancers (12Brodeur G.M.

Adenovirus E1B (55 kDa), SV40 T antigen, and HPV16 E6 oncoproteins do not seem to inactivate p73 (21Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Irwin M.S. DeCaprio J.A. Caput D. Kaelin W.G. Mol. Cell.

In this work, we have studied the regulation of p73 by E1A. We found that E1A could inhibit p73-mediated transcription very efficiently. While this work was under progress, similar results were independently reported (23Steegenga W.T. Shvarts A. Riteco N. Bos J.L. Jochemsen A.G. Mol. Cell.

We have further studied the mechanism of inhibition of p73-mediated transcriptional activation by E1A; the structural requirements within each protein for this inhibition; and more importantly, the physiological relevance of this inhibition during p73-mediated growth arrest with respect to transformation. pG13-Luc, WWP-Luc, pCEP4-p53, pcDNA3-p73α, pcDNA3-p73β, WT1 E1A, E1A(Δ2–36), E1A(ΔCR2), GST-E1A, G5E1BCAT, and pCMV-LacZ were described previously (16Somasundaram K.

WT E1A refers to 12 S form of E1A, and all of the mutant forms of E1A were derived from it. The fusion protein constructs consisting of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and either of the activation domains of p73 were made as follows. For the N-terminal activation domain, the region between amino acids 1–112 of p73α was amplified as a BamHI/XbaI fragment fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain by cloning the fragment into theBamHI and XbaI sites of the pM plasmid (Clontech). For the C-terminal activation domain, the region between amino acids 380 and 513 of p73α was amplified as aBamHI/XbaI fragment and fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain by cloning the fragment into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pM plasmid. Because the SV40 promoter, which drives the expression of Gal4 fusions in pM, is inhibited by E1A, we transferred the entire fragment carrying Gal4-activation domain fusions as BglII/XbaI fragments into theBamHI and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The mutant p53-expressing human colon cancer cell line SW480 was maintained in culture as described previously (16Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The human lung carcinoma cell line H1299 carries a homozygous deletion of p53 and was kindly provided by Dr. Tapas Kumar Kundu (Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bangalore, India). Transfections were carried out using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) or Escort (Sigma) following the manufacturers' recommendations or by the calcium phosphate method as described (26Somasundaram K. Jayaraman G. Williams T. Moran E. Frisch S. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3088-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In all transfections, 1 μg of pCMV-LacZ DNA was added to normalize the transfection efficiency variation between samples. Luciferase, β-galactosidase, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were performed as described previously (16Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S.

The following reaction conditions were used: 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The sequence of the nonspecific competitor was as follows: 5′-GATCCGAATTCGGTACC-3′. The p73 proteins were made by in vitro coupled transcription/translation (Promega), and E1A was bacterially synthesized and purified as a GST fusion protein (27Taylor D.A. Kraus V.B. Schwarz J.J.

Ad-E1A/1101 refers to Ad5Δ520E1B−/1101, which lacks E1B, but expresses 12 S E1A lacking amino acids 4–25. Ad-LacZ lacks both E1A and E1B, but carries β-galactosidase (25El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

Ad-p73 lacks both E1A and E1B, but carries simian p73β. (The details of the construction and characterization of Ad-p73 will be published elsewhere.) Adenoviral infections were carried out as described (16Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Western analysis and immunohistochemical staining were performed as described previously (16Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) with mouse anti-human p21WAF1/CIP1 antibody (Ab-1, Oncogene), mouse anti-Ad2 E1A monoclonal antibody (M73, Ab-1, Oncogene), mouse anti-human p73 monoclonal antibody (Ab-2, Oncogene), mouse anti-human Rb monoclonal antibody (clone LM95.1, Ab-5, Oncogene), and goat anti-human actin polyclonal antibody (I-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were harvested or fixed 24 h after viral infection and subjected to analysis. Under conditions in which two viral infections were performed, cells were infected with the second virus 6 h after the first viral infection; and 24 h after the second viral infection, the experiment was terminated. BrdUrd incorporation (31Zeng Y.X. Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and [3H]thymidine incorporation (16Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) were carried out as described. BrdUrd (20 μm) or [3H]thymidine (5 μCi) was added after 20 h of viral infection. The experiment was terminated 4 h after addition of these compounds, and DNA synthesis was measured either using anti-BrdUrd antibody (Ab-3, Oncogene) or by measuring the radioactivity with a scintillation counter. SW480 cells were infected with Ad-LacZ, Ad-E1A/WT, Ad-E1A/1101, Ad-p73, or the indicated combinations of viruses at m.o.i. = 10. BrdUrd (20 μm) was added to the cells during the last 4 h of the time points at which they were harvested. The cells were washed with PBS twice and harvested by trypsinization. The cells were washed again with PBS and fixed with cold 70% ethanol for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 2 n HCl and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 1 μg of anti-BrdUrd antibody for 30 min. The cells were washed again twice with PBS and incubated with 2 μg of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Oncogene) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS once and then incubated with 4 μg of ribonuclease A (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at room temperature. Propidium iodide was added to the cell suspension at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml and incubated for 30 min. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences). The results were quantified using the software WinList (Verity Software House Inc.). E1A has been shown to inhibit p53-mediated transcriptional activation (15Steegenga W.T. van Laar T. Riteco N.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of E1A on p73-mediated transcriptional activation, we studied the ability of p73 to activate transcription in the presence of E1A. We used the p53-specific reporter pG13-Luc to assay p73-mediated transcription. pG13-Luc contains a synthetic promoter with 13 copies of p53-binding sequence cloned in tandem upstream of a basal polyoma promoter (25El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar); transcription from this promoter is dependent upon the presence of the wild-type p53 protein (32Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). p73 activity can be studied by cotransfecting this reporter along with the p73 expression vector into a p53 null or mutant cell line. Neither p73α nor p73β activated transcription in the presence of WT E1A (Fig. 1, b andc). Moreover, the inhibition by WT E1A was dose-dependent (Fig. 1d). When activated, p53 has been shown to induce p21WAF1/CIP1, which is the major mediator of p53-mediated growth arrest (1Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6670) Google Scholar). Because p73 also induces p21WAF1/CIP1 upon overexpression, p21WAF1/CIP1may play an important role in p73-mediated growth arrest. WT E1A inhibited the transcriptional activation of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter by p73β (Fig. 1e). These results suggest that adenovirus E1A inhibits p73-mediated transcription very effectively. E1A is believed to transform cells by binding and abrogating the activities of two sets of cellular proteins: the p300/CBP family of coactivators and the pRb family of proteins (33Moran E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Inhibition of p53-mediated transcription by E1A requires its p300/CBP-binding region (16Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 34Lill N.L. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J. Livingston D.M.

Ogryzko K. Gardner A. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K. Cell. 1997; 8: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (585) Google Scholar). To determine the domain of E1A required for the inhibition of p73 function, we tested the ability of two deletion mutants of E1A to inhibit p73 function. The N-terminal deletion mutant E1A(Δ2–36), which does not bind to the p300/CBP family of coactivators, failed to inhibit p73-mediated transcription (Fig. 2, a, bar 4; and b, bar 4). However, the deletion mutant E1A(ΔCR2), which does not bind to the pRb family of proteins, inhibited p73 function very efficiently (Fig. 2, a,bar 5; and b, bar 5). Both WT E1A and its deletion mutants were detected in transfected cells (Fig.2c, lanes 2–4). These results suggest that an intact p300/CBP-binding region is required for E1A to inhibit p73 function. p73 binds to a sequence similar to p53-binding sequence and activates transcription (21Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Irwin M.S. DeCaprio J.A. Caput D. Kaelin W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6316-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of E1A on the sequence-specific DNA binding by p73 proteins, as it is essential for transactivation (10Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin W.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). p73α and p73β proteins synthesized in vitro using coupled transcription/translation system were used in this assay. p73 proteins bound to the p53-binding site (Fig.3, a, lane 3; andc, lane 4). The binding was specific, as it was competed efficiently by an unlabeled p53 oligonucleotide (Fig. 3,a, lanes 4–6; and c, lanes 5–7), but not by a nonspecific oligonucleotide (a,lanes 7–9; and c, lanes 8–10). E1A did not inhibit the sequence-specific DNA binding by p73β (Fig.3b, lane 5) and p73α (c, lane 12). These results suggest that the sequence-specific DNA binding by p73 is not targeted by E1A during its inhibition of p73 function. p73 has two activation domains: one in the N-terminal region, which has ∼25% similarity to the N terminus of p53, and the other in the C-terminal region (37Takada N. Ozaki T. Ichimiya S. Todo S. Nakagawara A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2810-2814PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the N-terminal activation domain is identical in p73α and p73β, the C-terminal activation domain, which extends from amino acids 380 to 513 in p73α, is terminated at amino acid 495 in p73β due to differential splicing (37Takada N. Ozaki T. Ichimiya S. Todo S. Nakagawara A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2810-2814PubMed Google Scholar). Because the sequence-specific DNA binding by p73 was not affected by E1A, we thought that E1A could inhibit p73-dependent transcription by targeting the activation domains. To examine this possibility, we studied the effect of E1A on the transcriptional activation by a fusion protein comprising the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and either of the activation domains of p73. E1A inhibited transcription from the N-terminal activation domain (Fig. 4, a, comparelanes 2 and 3; and c, comparebars 1 and 2) as well as from the C-terminal activation domain (b, compare lane 1 and2; and d, compare bars 1 and2) of p73α. The inhibition of Gal4 fusion proteins by WT E1A was specific because of the following reasons. Transcription by the Gal4-VP16 fusion protein was not inhibited by WT E1A (16Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The N-terminal deletion mutant E1A(Δ2–36) failed to inhibit transcription from either the N-terminal activation domain (Fig. 4,a, compare lanes 2 and 4; andc, compare bars 1 and 3) or the C-terminal activation domain (b, compare lanes 1and 3; and d, compare bars 1 and3) of p73. These experiments suggest that E1A specifically inhibits the activation domains of p73 and that the p300/CBP-binding region of E1A is required for this inhibition. Overexpression of p73 by transient transfection leads to induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 and growth arrest (10Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin W.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). To study the importance of inhibition of p73 function by E1A, we studied the ability of p73 to transactivate p21WAF1/CIP1 in the presence of E1A. We used a replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus carrying p73β (Ad-p73) for this purpose. We first checked the ability of p73 expressed from Ad-p73 to induce p21WAF1/CIP1 in the presence of E1A. We used the human lung carcinoma cell line H1299 for this experiment because it carries a homozygous deletion of p53. H1299 cells infected with a control virus (Ad-LacZ) showed very little or no expression of p73, E1A, and p21 proteins (Fig.5a, panels A,E, and I, respectively). Infection of H1299 cells with Ad-p73 led to accumulation of high levels of p73 and p21 (Fig.5a, panels B and J, respectively). However, when Ad-p73 infection was preceded by Ad-E1A/WT infection, cells expressed high levels of p73 and E1A, but not p21WAF1/CIP1 protein (Fig. 5a, panels C, G, and K, respectively). Results from reporter assay experiments suggested that an intact p300/CBP-binding region is required for E1A to inhibit p73 function (Fig. 2,a and b). To confirm this observation, we checked the effect of an N-terminal deletion mutant of E1A on p73-mediated induction of p21WAF1/CIP1. We used Ad-E1A/1101 for this purpose because it expresses an E1A protein with a deletion of amino acids 24 and 25, which makes it deficient for binding to p300/CBP proteins (29Shepherd S.E. Howe J.A. Mymryk J.S. Bayley S.T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2944-2949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mymryk J.S. Shire K. Bayley S.T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1187-1193PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike WT E1A, the N-terminal deletion mutant failed to inhibit p73-mediated induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 (Fig.5a, panel L). We also analyzed the p73 and p21WAF1/CIP1 levels by Western blotting in a similar experiment (Fig. 5b), the results of which were comparable to those of the immunohistochemical staining experiment. The presence of WT E1A, but not its N-terminal deletion mutant, inhibited the induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 by p73 (Fig. 5b, compare lanes 5 and 6). These results suggest that E1A inhibits p73-mediated induction of p21WAF1/CIP1efficiently through its p300/CBP-binding region. To correlate the immunohistochemical and Western blot data with changes in cell cycle phases, we studied the cell cycle profile under the same conditions. We first monitored cellular DNA synthesis by measuring BrdUrd and [3H]thymidine incorporation. The ability of p73 to inhibit DNA synthesis in the absence or presence of either WT E1A or its N-terminal deletion mutant was analyzed. Infection of H1299 cells with Ad-p73 resulted in a drastic reduction in the percentage of cells incorporating BrdUrd in comparison with Ad-LacZ-infected cells (Fig.6a, compare panels B and D), suggesting inhibition of cellular DNA synthesis upon overexpression of p73. However, prior expression of E1A by infecting cells with Ad-E1A/WT before Ad-p73 infection abrogated the p73-mediated DNA synthesis inhibition (Fig. 6a, comparepanels D and F). The results obtained in Fig.6a were quantified, and percent BrdUrd incorporation under different conditions is shown in Fig. 6b. Cellular DNA synthesis was also measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation under similar conditions. Infection of cells with Ad-p73 resulted in a drastic reduction of [3H]thymidine incorporation, which is indicative of DNA synthesis inhibition (Fig.6c, compare bars 1 and 2). However, expression of E1A before Ad-p73 infection resulted in the abrogation of DNA synthesis inhibition as seen by increased [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 6c, comparebars 2 and 3). In both of the above experiments, the N-terminal deletion mutant of E1A failed to abrogate the DNA synthesis inhibition by p73 (Fig. 6, a, comparepanels D and H; b, compare bars 2 and 4; and c, compare bars 2and 4). The phosphorylation status of Rb correlated with the extent of cellular DNA synthesis (Fig. 5c) under the conditions used in the above experiments. The hypophosphorylated form of Rb was seen in Ad-p73-infected cells (Fig. 5c, lane 2). In addition, Ad-p73-induced hypophosphorylated Rb was seen in cells expressing the N-terminal deletion mutant of E1A, but not WT E1A (Fig. 5c, lanes 4 and 6). Thus, it is evident from these results that abrogation of p73-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis correlates with the ability of E1A to inhibit p73-mediated transcriptional activation, particularly that of p21WAF1/CIP1. Moreover, the N terminus of E1A, which binds to the p300/CBP family of coactivators, is essential for E1A to mediate this function. Exogenous overexpression of p73 also induces apoptosis in addition to growth arrest (10Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin W.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). To distinguish between growth arrest and apoptosis in Ad-p73-infected cells as well as to confirm the above results, we analyzed the cell cycle profile by FACS. We first carried out a control experiment in which we obtained FACS profiles of either Ad-LacZ- or Ad-p73-infected cells at different time points after infection (Fig. 7a). Ad-p53-infected cells were used as a positive control. Upon Ad-p73 infection, cells with less than 2N DNA, representing apoptotic cells, appeared only after 48 h (34.9% versus 4.2%) in compariso"

We show that both Escherichia coli and eukaryotic initiator tRNAs have negative determinants, at the same positions, that block their activity in elongation.

The initiator tRNA is used for the initiation of protein synthesis, whereas the elongator tRNA is used for the insertion of methionine into internal peptidic linkages. Because of their unique function, initiator tRNAs, tRNAfMetin eubacteria and tRNAiMet in eukaryotes, have several properties that are different from those of elongator tRNAs (3RajBhandary U.L.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 547-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1) Initiator tRNAs bind directly to the P site of the ribosome in a reaction facilitated by the initiation factors, IF2 in eubacteria and eIF2 in eukaryotes. In contrast, elongator tRNAs bind to the A site of the ribosome. 2) Initiator tRNAs are used exclusively for the initiation of protein synthesis. This is achieved by preventing the binding of initiator methionyl-tRNAs to the elongation factors (EF1-Tu in eubacteria and eEF1 in eukaryotes), which carry aminoacyl-tRNAs to the A site on the ribosome (3RajBhandary U.L. Chow C.M. Söll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 511-528Google Scholar). In eubacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the initiator Met-tRNAfMet is formylated to formylmethionyl-tRNAfMet (fMet-tRNAfMet) by methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (5Marcker K.A. Sanger F. J. Mol. Biol. 1964; 8: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 6Dickerman H.W. Steers E. Redfield B.G. Weissbach H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Sundari R.M. Stringer E.A. Schulman L.H. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3338-3345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concomitantly, it makes the fMet-tRNAfMet an even worse substrate for EF-Tu (9Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), thereby ensuring sequestration of the initiator tRNA exclusively for initiation.Initiator tRNAs also possess unique sequence and/or structural features that are absent in elongator tRNAs. One of the unique features of eubacterial initiator tRNAfMet (Fig. 1) is the presence of a base pair mismatch between nucleotides 1 and 72 in the acceptor stem (C1xA72). Elongator tRNAs have Watson-Crick base pairs between these positions. It was shown earlier (10Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8859-8863Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Seong B.L. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6504-6508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that this mismatch in the acceptor stem is a primary determinant for exclusion of tRNAfMet from elongation. U1 and G72 mutations that generate a Watson-Crick base pair at this position allow the mutant tRNAs to bind to EF-Tu and act as elongators, whereas a U1G72 double mutation, which generates a U·G wobble base pair, does not (11Seong B.L. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6504-6508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Eukaryotic initiator tRNAs also have highly conserved nucleotides at position 1 and 72. In contrast to the C1xA72 mismatch in the bacterial initiator tRNA, eukaryotic initiator tRNAs have a A1:U72 base pair.In vivo and in vitro work on eukaryotic initiator tRNAs has shown that the primary determinant for preventing activity of these tRNAs in elongation resides in the sequence/structure of the TΨC stem, with the A1:U72 base pair acting as a secondary determinant (13Förster C. Chakraburtty K. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5679-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Dreher T.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Browning K.S. J. Biol.

For example, fungal and plant initiator tRNAs have a bulky 2′-O-phosphoribosyl modification on the ribose of nucleotide 64 in the TΨC stem (18Desgres J. Keith G. Kuo K.C. Gehrke C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 865-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Simsek M. RajBhandary U.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 3241-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Removal of this bulky modification allows the initiator tRNA to bind to eEF1 and to act as an elongator (13Förster C. Chakraburtty K. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5679-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Dreher T.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Browning K.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 79: 535-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Vertebrate initiator tRNAs lack this bulky modification (21Simsek M. RajBhandary U.L. Boisnard M. Petrissant G. Nature. 1974; 247: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,22Piper P.W. Clark B.F. Nature. 1974; 247: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, mutations of base pairs 50:64 and 51:63 allow the mutant tRNA to act as an elongator tRNA in vivo in mammalian cells suggesting that in the vertebrate initiator tRNAs it is the sequence-dependent perturbation of the TΨC stem that blocks the tRNA from acting as an elongator (17Drabkin H.J. Estrella M. RajBhandary U.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Coupling of the 50:64 and 51:63 base pair mutations with A1:U72 → G1:C72 mutation further increased the activity of the tRNA in elongation, suggesting that the rather weak A1:U72 base pair in the acceptor stem was a secondary determinant.Another tRNA that does not bind to E. coli EF-Tu is the selenocysteinyl-tRNASec, which binds to its own elongation factor encoded by the selB gene (23Forchhammer K. Leinfelder W. Böck A. Nature. 1989; 342: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this tRNA also, the primary determinant, which prevents the tRNA from binding to EF-Tu, has been located in the TΨC stem (24Rudinger J. Hillenbrandt R. Sprinzl M. Giegé R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Although the U1 and G72 mutants of E. colitRNAfMet are active in elongation, they are less active than the E. coli elongator methionine tRNA (tRNAMet). This finding raised the question of whether there are other determinants in the E. colitRNAfMet which further limit its activity in elongation. In particular, in view of the results above with eukaryotic initiator tRNAs and tRNASec, we have investigated whether the putative secondary determinant is located in the TΨC stem of the tRNA.This paper describes studies on the role of the U50·G64 wobble base pair in the TΨC stem of E. coli tRNAfMet. A wobble base pair at this site or in adjacent sites in the TΨC stem is found in most bacterial, mitochondrial, and chloroplast initiator tRNAs (25Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). (An update of this compilation can be found in www.uni-bayreuth.de/departments/biochemie/trna//.) We have mutated the U50·G64 wobble base pair to C50:G64 (C50 mutant) or to U50:A64 (A64 mutant) Watson-Crick base pairs and combined this to (i) mutations (U1, data not shown; G72 or G72G73) in the acceptor stem, which allow the tRNA to act in elongation; and (ii) mutations (U35A36) in the anticodon sequence, which allow the tRNAs to read the amber (UAG) termination codon. We show that mutations of the 50·64 wobble base pair to either C:G or U:A base pairs increases the activity in elongation of all of the mutant tRNAs in vivo. In addition, we have investigated whether this increase in elongation activity is due to increased affinity toward EF-Tu.DISCUSSIONThe primary negative determinant blocking activity of E. coli initiator tRNAfMet in elongation is the C1xA72 mismatch at the end of the acceptor stem. This is due to perturbation of the RNA helical structure caused by the C1xA72 mismatch (10Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8859-8863Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that the E. coli initiator tRNA has a secondary negative determinant, the 50·64 wobble base pair, that is located in the TΨC stem. Interestingly, eukaryotic initiator tRNAs also have negative determinants at these sites except that the primary negative determinant is located in the TΨC stem and the secondary negative determinant is the A1:U72 base pair, which is unique to and is highly conserved in eukaryotic initiator tRNAs (17Drabkin H.J. Estrella M. RajBhandary U.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Plant and fungal initiator tRNAs have a bulky 2′-O-phosphoribosyl modification attached to the ribose of nucleotide 64. This bulky modification protrudes into the minor groove of the TΨC stem and most likely acts as a steric block for the binding of eEF1 (13Förster C. Chakraburtty K. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5679-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Dreher T.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Browning K.S. J. Biol.

Ott G. Sprinzl M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4677-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In vertebrate initiator tRNAs that lack the bulky modification, the 50:64 and possibly 51:63 base pairs act as negative determinants most likely by perturbing the sugar phosphate backbone in the TΨC stem (17Drabkin H.J. Estrella M. RajBhandary U.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the negative determinants for elongation are located at the same sites in bacterial and in eukaryotic initiator tRNAs. Fig. 7shows the location of these negative determinants in the initiator tRNAs in a ribbon diagram of the three-dimensional structure of tRNA.Figure 7Ribbon diagram of three-dimensional structure of tRNA highlighting the negative determinants for elongation inE. coli and in eukaryotic initiator tRNAs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Does the secondary negative determinant in the TΨC stem of E. coli initiator tRNA affect elongation activity of the tRNA by modulating the binding affinity of the aminoacyl-tRNA to EF-Tu·GTP? Binding assays show that mutation of the U50·G64 wobble base pair to C50:G64 or U50:A64 increases only marginally the binding affinity of the aminoacyl-tRNAs to EF-Tu·GTP. The koffvalues of the ternary complexes formed between EF-Tu·GTP and the mutant aminoacyl-tRNAs suggest a more significant increase, 2.4–2.6-fold, in stability of the ternary complexes formed with the C50 and A64 mutant aminoacyl-tRNAs (Table IV, top half). Whether these small improvements in binding affinity for EF-Tu·GTP and the stabilities of the EF-Tu·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA ternary complexes are sufficient to account for the increased activities of these mutant tRNAs as amber suppressors in vivo (Table I) or whether the increased activity is also due to a better accommodation of the A64 and C50 mutant tRNAs into the ribosomal A site is not known. It is important to note, however, that 2–3-fold increases in vitro in EF-Tu·GTP binding affinity of the Su+7 tRNA aminoacylated with glutamine over that aminoacylated with tryptophan (43Knowlton R.G. Yarus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) results in selection in vivo of glutamine over tryptophan by a factor of 9 (44Soll L. Berg P. Nature. 1969; 223: 1340-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Celis J.E. Coulondre C. Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).A striking result of our work is the very large effect of the amino acid attached to the tRNA on EF-Tu binding affinity of wild type and mutant initiator tRNAs. The binding of the wild type tRNA aminoacylated with methionine is so unstable that it was not possible to obtain an accurate estimate of KDapp (Fig.4B and Table III). Binding assays carried out in 50 mm NH4Cl instead of 150 mmNH4Cl gave essentially the same result. In contrast, binding of the U35A36 mutant tRNA aminoacylated with glutamine was fairly strong with a KDapp of 27 nm. Similarly, whereas the EF-Tu·GTP·Met-tRNAfMet ternary complex had a dissociation rate constant of 453 × 10−4s−1 (Table IV) corresponding to a half-life of 15 s, the ternary complex formed with the U35A36 mutant Gln-tRNAfMet had a dissociation rate constant of 6.21 × 10−4 s−1 corresponding to a half-life of 17 min. Because the only difference between these two tRNAs is in the anticodon sequence and EF-Tu is known not to interact with the anticodon (9Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), the difference in binding affinities and stability of the ternary complexes is due to the different amino acids attached to the tRNA. Knowlton and Yarus (43Knowlton R.G. Yarus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were the first to show that Su+7 tRNA aminoacylated with glutamine bound to EF-Tu·GTP with a KDapp 2–3-fold lower than the same tRNA aminoacylated with tryptophan. More recently, in a thorough analysis, Uhlenbeck and co-workers (31LaRiviere F.J. Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Science. 2001; 294: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 46Asahara H. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3499-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have demonstrated a significant effect of the amino acid attached to a tRNA on its binding affinity for EF-Tu·GTP and have observed 60–150-fold differences in KD values for the same tRNAs aminoacylated with glutamine, phenylalanine, valine, and alanine, with glutamine being the tightest binding amino acid. Our findings and those of Uhlenbeck and co-workers are also consistent with the known effects of amino acids attached to a tRNA on its interaction with other aminoacyl-tRNA or peptidyl-tRNA-binding proteins or enzymes such as MTF (11Seong B.L.

Thus, proteins that bind to or utilize aminoacyl-tRNAs or formylaminoacyl-tRNAs as substrates are quite sensitive to the nature of the amino acid attached to the tRNA.The binding (KDapp, 27 nm) of the U35A36 mutant Gln-tRNAfMet to EF-Tu·GTP is slightly stronger than that of the G72 mutant Met-tRNAfMet (KDapp, 34.8 nm) (Table III), yet the U35A36 mutant tRNAfMet is essentially inactive as an elongator tRNAin vivo (Table I), whereas the G72 mutant is active as an elongator in vitro (10Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8859-8863Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reason for it is that despite its relatively strong affinity for EF-Tu, the U35A36 mutant tRNA is a good substrate for MTF and therefore is formylated in vivoto fGln-tRNA. Because the amino group of glutamine is blocked in fGln-tRNA, this tRNA now binds very poorly to EF-Tu and cannot, in any case, participate in the elongation reaction on the ribosome because of the blocked amino group. In strains severely deficient in MTF, however, the U35A36 mutant initiator tRNA does act weakly as an elongator tRNA (55Guillon J.M. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4507-4514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, mutant tRNAs that are extremely poor substrates for MTF can act as elongators in vivo, albeit weakly, even though they contain a C1xA72 mismatch (56Li S. Kumar N.V. Varshney U. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1022-1028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These results highlight yet another important role of formylation of the initiator tRNA in ensuring sequestration of the tRNA for initiation.The strong effect of methionine in modulating the binding affinity of Met-tRNAfMet for EF-Tu highlights yet another important reason why methionine is the best amino acid for the initiation of protein synthesis in E. coli. Initiation requires formylation of the initiator Met-tRNA to fMet-tRNA by MTF. The formyl group then acts as a positive determinant for IF2. We and others (47Varshney U. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L.

FEBS Lett. 1973; 30: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have shown that MTF prefers methionine over all the other amino acids tested. Similarly, IF2 also prefers formylmethionine over several other formyl amino acids tested (51Wu X.Q. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1891-1895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our finding that EF-Tu binds extremely poorly to the wild type Met-tRNAfMet but binds quite well to the U35A36 mutant Gln-tRNAfMet provides yet another role for methionine in minimizing the affinity of the initiator Met-tRNAfMet for EF-Tu. This allows MTF, which is present in extremely small amounts in E. coli (57Meinnel T. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7737-7740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to compete for Met-tRNAfMet with EF-Tu, which is the most abundant protein in E. coli (58Hershey J.W.B. Niehardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 613-647Google Scholar). Finally, although fMet-tRNAfMet is not a substrate for peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (59Kössel H. RajBhandary U.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 35: 539-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), Varshney and co-workers (54Thanedar S. Kumar N.V. Varshney U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20361-20367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have shown that the U35A36 mutant fGln-tRNAfMet is a substrate for peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase. Thus, methionine plays yet another important role in ensuring the availability of fMet-tRNA for initiation by preventing its hydrolysis by peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase. A special methionine tRNA is used for the initiation of protein synthesis in all organisms studied (1Clark B.F. Marcker K.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 17: 394-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3RajBhandary U.L. Chow C.M. Söll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 511-528Google Scholar). The initiator tRNA is used for the initiation of protein synthesis, whereas the elongator tRNA is used for the insertion of methionine into internal peptidic linkages. Because of their unique function, initiator tRNAs, tRNAfMetin eubacteria and tRNAiMet in eukaryotes, have several properties that are different from those of elongator tRNAs (3RajBhandary U.L. Chow C.M. Söll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 511-528Google Scholar, 4RajBhandary U.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 547-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1) Initiator tRNAs bind directly to the P site of the ribosome in a reaction facilitated by the initiation factors, IF2 in eubacteria and eIF2 in eukaryotes. In contrast, elongator tRNAs bind to the A site of the ribosome. 2) Initiator tRNAs are used exclusively for the initiation of protein synthesis. This is achieved by preventing the binding of initiator methionyl-tRNAs to the elongation factors (EF1-Tu in eubacteria and eEF1 in eukaryotes), which carry aminoacyl-tRNAs to the A site on the ribosome (3RajBhandary U.L. Chow C.M. Söll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 511-528Google Scholar). In eubacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the initiator Met-tRNAfMet is formylated to formylmethionyl-tRNAfMet (fMet-tRNAfMet) by methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (5Marcker K.A. Sanger F. J. Mol. Biol. 1964; 8: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 6Dickerman H.W. Steers E. Redfield B.G. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1522-1525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formyl group acts as a positive determinant for IF2 (7Canonaco M.A. Calogero R.A. Gualerzi C.O. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Sundari R.M. Stringer E.A. Schulman L.H. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3338-3345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concomitantly, it makes the fMet-tRNAfMet an even worse substrate for EF-Tu (9Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), thereby ensuring sequestration of the initiator tRNA exclusively for initiation. Initiator tRNAs also possess unique sequence and/or structural features that are absent in elongator tRNAs. One of the unique features of eubacterial initiator tRNAfMet (Fig. 1) is the presence of a base pair mismatch between nucleotides 1 and 72 in the acceptor stem (C1xA72). Elongator tRNAs have Watson-Crick base pairs between these positions. It was shown earlier (10Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8859-8863Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Seong B.L. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6504-6508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that this mismatch in the acceptor stem is a primary determinant for exclusion of tRNAfMet from elongation. U1 and G72 mutations that generate a Watson-Crick base pair at this position allow the mutant tRNAs to bind to EF-Tu and act as elongators, whereas a U1G72 double mutation, which generates a U·G wobble base pair, does not (11Seong B.L. Lee C.P. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6504-6508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic initiator tRNAs also have highly conserved nucleotides at position 1 and 72. In contrast to the C1xA72 mismatch in the bacterial initiator tRNA, eukaryotic initiator tRNAs have a A1:U72 base pair.In vivo and in vitro work on eukaryotic initiator tRNAs has shown that the primary determinant for preventing activity of these tRNAs in elongation resides in the sequence/structure of the TΨC stem, with the A1:U72 base pair acting as a secondary determinant (13Förster C.
