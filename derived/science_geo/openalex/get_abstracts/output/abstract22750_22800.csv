https://openalex.org/W2081028995,"The cerebral cortex of the mammalian brain has expanded rapidly during the course of evolution and acquired structurally distinguishable areas devoted to separate functions. In some brain regions, topographic restrictions to cell intermixing occur during embryonic development. As a means of examining experimentally whether such restrictions occur during formation of functional subdivisions in the rat neocortex, clonally related neocortical cells were marked by retroviral-mediated transfer of a histochemical marker gene. Clonal boundaries were determined by infection of the developing brain with a library of genetically distinct viruses and amplification of single viral genomes by the polymerase chain reaction. Many clonally related neurons in the cerebral cortex became widely dispersed across functional areas of the cortex. Specification of cortical areas therefore occurs after neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2029841586,"During development, the genotype of the zygote determines the nature of the gonad, which then determines the male or female phenotype. The molecular events underlying this process are just beginning to be defined. A single treatment of chicken embryos with an aromatase inhibitor (which blocks the synthesis of estrogen from testosterone) at a stage when their gonads were bipotential caused genetic females to develop a permanent male phenotype. These sex-reversed females developed bilateral testes that were capable of complete spermatogenesis and had the physical appearance and behavior of normal males. This result identifies aromatase as a key developmental switch in the sex determination of chickens."
https://openalex.org/W1983300728,"The protein encoded by the human testis determining gene, SRY, contains a high mobility group (HMG) box related to that present in the T cell-specific, DNA-binding protein TCF-1. Recombinant SRY protein was able to bind to the same core sequence AACAAAG recognized by TCF-1 in a sequence dependent manner. In five XY females point mutations were found in the region encoding the HMG box. In four cases DNA binding activity of mutant SRY protein was negligible; in the fifth case DNA binding was reduced. These results imply that the DNA binding activity of SRY is required for sex determination."
https://openalex.org/W1489283017,"We have studied the induction of the mitochondrial cyclosporin A-sensitive permeability transition pore (PTP) by the bifunctional SH group reagent phenylarsine oxide (PhAsO). Addition of nanomolar concentrations of the electroneutral H(+)-K+ ionophore nigericin to nonrespiring mitochondria in sucrose medium determines a dramatic increase of the time required for PTP induction by PhAsO, while no effect of nigericin is apparent in KCl medium. Using mitochondria loaded with the internal pH indicator 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein, we show that the effect of nigericin is mediated by the ionophore-induced acidification of matrix pH. Indeed, experimental manipulation of pHi by a number of treatments indicates that PTP induction is directly related to matrix pH, in that the PTP induction process becomes slower as pHi decreases at constant pHo. PTP induction by PhAsO in respiration-inhibited mitochondria is stimulated by Ca2+ and inhibited by a series of divalent cations. Since PhAsO induces the PTP even in the presence of excess EGTA and in the absence of respiration (Lenartowicz, E., Bernardi, P., and Azzone, G.F. (1991) J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 23, 679-688), we have been able to study the Ca2+ dependence of the induction process. We show that the apparent Km for Ca2+ activation is about 10(-5) M and that Ca2+, cyclosporin A, and inhibitory Me2+ ions behave as if they were competing for the same binding site(s) on the pore. Since similar results are obtained from patch-clamp experiments on the mitochondrial megachannel (Szabo, I., Bernardi, P., and Zoratti, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2940-2946), we suggest that (i) the PTP and the mitochondrial megachannel are the same molecular structures and (ii) the same factors affect both the process of pore induction and its open-closed orientation."
https://openalex.org/W2081216682,"Spatial gradients of axon guiding molecules have long been suspected to provide positional and directional cues for retinal ganglion cell axons growing within the optic tectum. With the identification of a guiding activity from tectal cell membranes, it has become possible to investigate the potential physiological significance of molecular gradients for retinal growth cone behavior in vitro. A subset of retinal growth cones, those from the temporal half, were highly sensitive to small concentration changes of the guiding component. The degree of response was correlated with the strength of the gradient. These findings demonstrate that the neural growth cone can read gradients of surface-associated information."
https://openalex.org/W1539200107,"We have designed model protein that consists of two identical 35-residue polypeptide chains, parallel and in-register arranged in two-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coil structure. This structure is stabilized by interchain hydrophobic interactions between leucine residues at positions a and of repeating heptad sequence. To determine the positional effects of interchain hydrophobic interactions on the stability of the coiled-coil, single leucine residue in each chain at position a (9, 16, 23, 30) and (5, 12, 19, 26, 33) was systematically replaced by an alanine. All these proteins formed two-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coils in benign conditions (0.05 M phosphate, 0.1 M KCl, pH 7). The stability of each mutant protein was determined by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation experiments, where the decrease in ellipticity at 220 nm was monitored by circular dichroism. The single alanine replacements of leucine residue at hydrophobic positions and/or d are all shown to destabilize the coiled-coil structure. The non-equivalent hydrophobic positions and d make an equivalent contribution to protein stability along the majority of the coiled-coil structure (positions 9-30). The small decrease in coiled-coil stability caused by Leu----Ala substitution at either ends of the coiled-coil suggested that the Leu-Leu hydrophobic interactions are less important at the ends of the coiled-coil and the ends of the coiled-coil are more flexible. Analysis of the difference between the ellipticity in benign buffer and in 50% trifluoroethanol (delta theta 220) and the slope term from plot of the free energy of unfolding versus guanidine hydrochloride concentration also supported the conclusion that the leucine residues at the ends of the coiled-coil are much less buried than in the middle section of the coiled-coil."
https://openalex.org/W2036097912,"Although methods of phylogenetic estimation are used routinely in comparative biology, direct tests of these methods are hampered by the lack of known phylogenies. Here a system based on serial propagation of bacteriophage T7 in the presence of a mutagen was used to create the first completely known phylogeny. Restriction-site maps of the terminal lineages were used to infer the evolutionary history of the experimental lines for comparison to the known history and actual ancestors. The five methods used to reconstruct branching pattern all predicted the correct topology but varied in their predictions of branch lengths; one method also predicts ancestral restriction maps and was found to be greater than 98 percent accurate."
https://openalex.org/W1557173992,"Cytosolically synthesized thylakoid proteins must be translocated across the chloroplast envelope membranes, traverse the stroma, and then be translocated into or across the thylakoid membrane. Protein transport across the envelope requires ATP hydrolysis but not electrical or proton gradients. The energy requirements for the thylakoid translocation step were studied here for the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (LHCP), an integral membrane protein, and for several thylakoid lumen-resident proteins: plastocyanin and OE33, OE23, and OE17 (the 33-, 23-, and 17-kDa subunits of the oxygen-evolving complex, respectively). Dissipation of the thylakoid protonmotive force during an in organello protein import assay partially inhibited the thylakoid localization of LHCP and OE33, totally inhibited localization of OE23 and OE17, and had no effect on localization of plastocyanin. We used reconstitution assays for LHCP insertion and for OE23 and OE17 transport into isolated thylakoids to investigate the energy requirements in detail. The results indicated that LHCP insertion absolutely requires ATP hydrolysis and is enhanced by a transthylakoid delta pH and that transport of OE23 and OE17 is absolutely dependent upon a delta pH. Surprisingly, OE23 and OE17 transport occurred maximally in the complete absence of ATP. These results establish the thylakoid membrane as the only membrane system in which a delta pH can provide all of the energy required to translocate proteins across the bilayer. They also demonstrate that the energy requirements for integration into or translocation across the thylakoid membranes are protein-specific."
https://openalex.org/W1549749234,"Two new factors required for transcription of class II genes have been identified. These factors, TFIIH and TFIIJ, were required together with the previously described general factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, and TFIIF) and RNA polymerase II for transcription of different class II genes. TFIIH was extensively purified, and the activity appeared to coelute with polypeptides of 33 and 95 kDa. The role of TFIIH and TFIIJ in preinitiation complex assembly was analyzed using mobility shift assays. It was found that TFIIH and TFIIJ association with the preinitiation complex was ordered and required the previous assembly of a preinitiation complex intermediate containing factors IID, IIB, IIF, IIE, and RNA polymerase II. A model for the ordered assembly of the general factors and RNA polymerase II is presented."

https://openalex.org/W1516384077,"We have studied the turnover of an abundant chloroplast protein, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rbu-P2 carboxylase/oxygenase), in plants (Spirodela oligorrhiza and Triticum aestivum L.) and algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and C. moewusii) induced to senesce under oxidative conditions. Rbu-P2 carboxylase/oxygenase activity and stability in vivo were found to be highly susceptible to oxidative stress, resulting in intermolecular cross-linking of large subunits by disulfide bonds within the holoenzyme, rapid and specific translocation of the soluble enzyme complex to the chloroplast membranes, and finally protein degradation. The redox state of Cys-247 in Rbu-P2 carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit seems involved in the sensitivity of the holoenzyme to oxidative inactivation and cross-linking. However, this process did not drive membrane attachment or degradation of Rbu-P2 carboxylase/oxygenase in vivo. Translocation of oxidized Rbu-P2 carboxylase/oxygenase to chloroplast membranes may be a necessary step in its turnover, particularly during leaf senescence. Thus, processes that regulate the redox state of plant cells seem closely intertwined with cellular switches shifting the leaf from growth and maturation to senescence and death."
https://openalex.org/W2010359145,Secretion of gonadotropic hormones from pituitary gonadotropes in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is essential for regulation of reproductive potential. Gonadotropes from male rats exhibited an unusual form of cellular excitation that resulted from periodic membrane hyperpolarization. GnRH induced an oscillatory release of intracellular Ca2+ via a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein-coupled phosphoinositide pathway and hyperpolarized the gonadotrope periodically by opening apamin-sensitive Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels. Each hyperpolarization was terminated by firing of a few action potentials that may result from removal of inactivation from voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels.

https://openalex.org/W1538766331,"Abstract In meiotic cells of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a DNA exonuclease activity increased approximately 5-fold after premeiotic S-phase and decreased to the initial level before the meiotic divisions. We have purified this activity, designated exonuclease I, to near homogeneity. The activity co-purified with a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 36,000. With a linear double-stranded DNA substrate, exonuclease I degraded only the 5'-ended strand from each end to produce 3'-single-stranded tails. The enzyme also acted on nicked circular DNA with comparable affinity. The meiotic induction of exonuclease I and its mode of action, similar to that of recombination-promoting exonucleases from bacteria, suggest that exonuclease I is involved in meiotic homologous recombination in S. pombe."
https://openalex.org/W2050834939,"The bacteriophage phi 29 DNA polymerase, involved both in the protein-primed initiation and elongation steps of the viral DNA replication, displays a very processive 3',5'-exonuclease activity acting preferentially on single-stranded DNA. This exonucleolytic activity showed a marked preference for excision of a mismatched versus a correctly paired 3' terminus. These characteristics enable the phi 29 DNA polymerase to act as a proofreading enzyme. A comparative analysis of the wild-type phi 29 DNA polymerase and a mutant lacking 3',5'-exonuclease activity indicated that a productive coupling between the exonuclease and polymerase activities is necessary to prevent fixation of polymerization errors. Based on these data, the phi 29 DNA polymerase, a model enzyme for protein-primed DNA replication, appears to share the same mechanism for the editing function as that first proposed for T4 DNA polymerase and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I on the basis of functional and structural studies."
https://openalex.org/W1520041833,"Complement receptor (CR)-mediated phagocytosis is associated with an increased accumulation of diglyceride (sn-1,2-diacylglycerol and/or 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-glycerol) in human neutrophils. The C3bi-mediated increase in diglyceride (5-20 min) was only partially impaired when phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) activity was abolished by reduction of cytosolic free Ca2+. At an early time point (1 min), however, diglyceride production was barely detectable in control cells, whereas production was considerable in cells with a reduced cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration. C3bi stimulation of 32P-labeled neutrophils caused a rapid and significant breakdown of [32P]phosphatidylcholine (PC) which was not affected by inhibition of Ca(2+)-dependent phosphoinositide-specific PLC. Thus, PC hydrolysis could be involved in C3bi-induced diglyceride formation. Stimulation of cells labeled with [3H]1-O-alkyl-lyso-PC ([3H]alkyl-lyso-PC), resulted in an increased formation of [3H]1-O-alkyl-phosphatidic acid ([3H]alkyl-PA) and a later and slower formation of [3H]1-O-alkyl-diglyceride ([3H]alkyl-diglyceride); this suggests activation of phospholipase D (PLD). When these labeled cells were stimulated in the presence of 0.5% ethanol a marked accumulation of [3H]1-O-alkyl-phosphatidylethanol ([3H]alkyl-PEt) was observed in both controls and calcium-reduced cells, further strengthening the suggested involvement of PLD activity. In parallel with the sustained increase in diglyceride formation, CR-mediated phagocytosis was also associated with phosphorylation of a cellular protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS). Therefore it seems reasonable to suggest a causal relationship between C3bi-induced PLD activation, which results in diglyceride formation, and activation of protein kinase C. In electropermeabilized cells which were incapable of ingesting particles, C3bi particles were still able to activate PLD and induce formation of diglyceride. This signaling event must therefore be triggered by binding of particles to the cell and not by the engulfment process. Most importantly, introduction of the protein kinase C inhibitor peptides, PKC(19-36) and PKC(19-31), into these permeabilized cells resulted in a clear reduction of the C3bi-induced production of diglyceride, indicating that CR-mediated activation of protein kinase C directly triggers a positive feedback mechanism for additional diglyceride formation. Taken together, these data further clarify the mechanisms of CR-mediated diglyceride formation and give added support to the concept that protein kinase C plays an important role in the phagocytic process."
https://openalex.org/W1487524116,"The soluble core of catecholamine storage vesicles in the adrenal medulla contains high concentrations of the cations calcium (20 mM) and catecholamine (600 mM). Do these cations interact with the abundant vesicle core anionic proteins, the chromogranins? We investigated the binding of calcium and norepinephrine (NE) to bovine adrenal chromogranins by equilibrium dialysis. Both calcium and NE were bound saturably by chromogranins, with low affinity (Kd values of 1.3 x 10(-4) M and 2.1 x 10(-3) M), but high capacity (17 and 32 mol of ligand/mol of chromogranin A). Both ligands bound maximally at a pH greater than 5.5 and were displaced by competing cations in a pattern (trivalent greater than divalent greater than monovalent) consistent with electrostatic components to the interactions. Binding of calcium and NE was not impaired by prior heat denaturation of the chromogranins, and chromogranin A was involved in both binding reactions. Calcium but not NE binding was enhanced by nonpolar solvents. Temperature dependence studies indicated that calcium binding to chromogranins was largely entropy-driven, while NE binding was driven by a significantly negative (favorable) change in enthalpy (5760 cal/mol), even in the face of an unfavorable entropy. Exposure of chromogranins to calcium or NE resulted in precipitation (aggregation) as analyzed by centrifugation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. NE was a more effective chromogranin precipitant than calcium, and in combination, the NE effect was antagonized by calcium. Precipitation of chromogranins by both calcium and NE was inhibited by NaCl at ionic strengths comparable with those of the ligands. These data suggest that chromogranins bind and are precipitated by calcium and NE at affinities compatible with their in situ concentrations, but that the interactions exhibit different thermodynamic driving forces. Furthermore, NE may trigger an enthalpy-driven conformational change in chromogranins, resulting in aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1876989035,"Epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor (EDIN) is a recently discovered protein which inhibits terminal differentiation of cultured keratinocytes (Sugai, M., Enomoto, T., Hashimoto, K., Matsumoto, K., Matsuo, Y., Ohgai, H., Hong, Y.-M., Inoue, S., Yoshikawa, K., and Suginaka, H. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 173, 92-98). The amino acid sequenced deduced from the EDIN gene has revealed that EDIN shares high amino acid sequence homology with the exoenzyme C3 of Clostridium botulinum (Inoue, S., Sugai, M., Murooka, Y., Paik, S.-Y., Hong, Y.-M., Ohgai, H., and Suginaka, H. (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 174, 459-464), which has been shown to ADP-ribosylate the rho/rac proteins (members of the small GTP-binding protein family). We show here that EDIN ADP-ribosylates rhoB p21 in time- and dose-dependent manners in a cell-free system. Kinetic studies of the ADP-ribosylation and peptide mapping of the reaction products of rhoB p21 by EDIN and C3 suggest that the mode of action of the ADP-ribosylation by EDIN is quite similar to that by C3 and that the ADP-ribosylation site of rhoB p21 by EDIN is presumably the same as that by C3. Proteins in epidermal membranes and keratinocyte homogenate with Mr values of about 22,000 are ADP-ribosylated by EDIN or C3. Treatment of cultured human keratinocytes by EDIN or C3 results in an inhibition of terminal differentiation and a stimulation of growth of the cells. Moreover, EDIN and C3 injected into adult mouse skin induce hyperplasia of epidermis. These results suggest that EDIN and C3 affect growth and differentiation of keratinocytes by ADP-ribosylation of protein(s) with a Mr of about 22,000, which may be the rho/rac proteins or related proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1597966586,"Previous studies have identified several biochemical parameters that resolve promoter-specific transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II into distinct steps. We have employed these parameters to compare the mechanisms of initiation mediated through either a TATA box or a transcriptional initiator element. Time course experiments revealed that initiator-mediated transcription in a cell-free extract does not display the lag period typically found with TATA-mediated transcription. Titration experiments with increasing amounts of extract revealed further differences between TATA- and initiator-mediated transcription, again suggesting that different steps are rate-limiting. In contrast, experiments with the detergent Sarkosyl, which is believed to define later steps in the initiation process, revealed a striking degree of similarity between TATA- and initiator-mediated transcription. Additional similarities were found using dinucleotide priming experiments, which are believed to measure the flexibility of initiation after RNA polymerase II is positioned over the transcription start site region. Taken together, these results suggest that the location of a preinitiation complex can be determined by core promoter recognition through either a TATA box or an initiator element. However, following these distinct template recognition events, the steps leading to initiation may be very similar and may proceed in a DNA sequence-independent manner."

https://openalex.org/W1585032009,"Deamidase cleaves ester and peptide bonds in various substrates and deamidates protected COOH-terminal amino acids. It preferentially hydrolyzes peptides which contain hydrophobic amino acids in the P1' and/or P1 position. Because the COOH-terminal end of endothelin I contains the hydrophobic sequence -Ile19-Ile20-Trp21-OH, we investigated whether human deamidase, purified from platelets, could inactivate this peptide. We found that deamidase readily cleaved off Trp21 with an acid pH optimum, a Km = 22 microM, a kcat of 1454 min-1, and a kcat/Km of 68 microM-1 min-1. We also found the enzyme to be present in target cells of endothelin, in vascular smooth muscle cells. Extracts of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells cleave both the synthetic fluorescent substrate 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl(Dns)-Phe-Leu-Arg and endothelin I by releasing the COOH-terminal amino acid. The reaction was inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Leu-Phe-CH2Cl, and p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate, which inhibit the purified deamidase, but not by inhibitors of some other peptidases. The rate of hydrolysis of endothelin I in the soluble, 100,000 x g final supernatant of the homogenized smooth muscle cells was 2.1 mumol/h/mg and 3.1 mumol/h/mg for Dns-Phe-Leu-Arg. Thus, smooth muscles, platelets, and many other tissues which contain the deamidase can inactivate endothelin by cleaving the COOH-terminal tryptophan."
https://openalex.org/W2089252539,"Subdomain-size proteolytic fragments of Escherichia coli trp repressor have been produced that assemble in defined order to regenerate fully native dimers. By characterization of the secondary and tertiary structures of isolated and recombined fragments, the structure of assembly intermediates can be correlated with the kinetic folding pathway of the intact repressor deduced from spectroscopic measurement of folding rates. The nativelike structure of these intermediates provides further evidence that protein folding pathways reflect the stabilities of secondary structural units and assemblies found in the native state. The proteolytic method should be generally useful in adding structural detail to spectroscopically determined folding mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1553385403,"We have used an antisense approach to investigate the role of overexpression of the normal human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in the transformed phenotype of KB cells, which are a tumor derived human cell line. Initial experiments performed in vitro, showed that antisense RNA complementary to the entire coding region (AS-FL) or to parts of the EGF-R mRNA (AS-3', AS-5', and AS-K) effectively blocked translation of EGF-R mRNA. In addition, upon microinjection into KB cells, the in vitro synthesized antisense RNAs were able to inhibit transiently the synthesis of EGF-R. Inhibition was concentration-dependent, both in vitro and in cells, and the most effective constructs were those complementary to the entire coding region (AS-FL) or to the 3'-coding end of the mRNA (AS-3'). Transfection of the same EGF-R antisense RNA constructs into the human epidermoid carcinoma KB cell line gave rise to several clones stably expressing elevated levels of antisense RNA and resulting in low residual levels of EGF receptor. The most reduced clones exhibited a totally restored serum-dependent growth and were severely impaired in colony formation and growth in agar. In addition the severity of the phenotype was directly proportional to the residual amount of EGF-R expressed. We conclude that over-expression of normal EGF-R plays a direct primary role in the development of the transformed phenotype of this human cancer cell line."

Final purification of the enzyme was achieved by high pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration and resulted in a homogeneous protein as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the radiolabeled protein. The native enzyme appears as a molecule of apparent Mr 150,000 as determined by gel filtration high pressure liquid chromatography. The apparent Mr of the enzyme resolved in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was determined to be 50,000, indicating a multisubunit structure of the enzyme. Secretor-type alpha 1----2-fucosyltransferase is a glycoprotein as determined by WGA binding properties. A comparison of the Mr of the native blood group H gene encoded with the secretor-type beta-galactoside alpha 1----2-fucosyltransferases as well as comparison of subunit Mr for both enzymes suggests structural similarity. The alpha 1----2 linkage formed between alpha-L-fucose and terminal beta-D-galactose by the purified H- and secretor-type alpha 1----2-fucosyltransferases was determined by 1H NMR homonuclear cross-irradiation analysis of the oligosaccharide products. The substrate specificity and Km values calculated from the initial rate using various oligosaccharide acceptors showed that purified enzymes differ primarily in affinity for phenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside and GDP-fucose as well as type 1 (Gal beta 1----3GlcNAc), 2 (Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc), and 3 (Gal beta 1----3GalNAc) oligosaccharide acceptors. The secretor-type alpha 1----2-fucosyltransferase shows significantly lower affinity than the H enzyme for phenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside and GDP-fucose as well as for type 2 oligosaccharide acceptors. On the contrary, type 1 and 3 oligosaccharide acceptors are preferentially utilized by the secretor-type enzyme as compared with the H enzyme. The enzymes also differ in several physicochemical properties, implying nonidentity of the two enzymes (Sarnesto, A., Kohlin, T., Thurin, J., and Blaszczyk-Thurin, M. (1990) J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1550045807,"Previous observations suggested that incubating fibroblasts at elevated temperature caused over-modification of type I procollagen by post-translational enzymes because of a delay in folding of the collagen triple helix. Here, human skin fibroblasts were incubated at 40.5 instead of 37 degrees C, and the type I procollagen secreted into the medium was isolated. Analysis of the protein indicated that there was an increase of about 5 residues of hydroxylysine/alpha chain and about 1 residue of glycosylated hydroxylysine/alpha chain. Assays with procollagen N-proteinase indicated that the N-propeptide of the over-modified collagen was cleaved at a decreased rate, apparently because the over-modification altered the conformation-dependent cleavage site for the enzyme. Assays in a system for assembly of collagen into fibrils demonstrated that the over-modified protein had a higher critical concentration for self-assembly. Also, the fibrils formed from the over-modified collagen at 31 and 29 degrees C had smaller diameters than fibrils formed from normal type I collagen. The results provide direct evidence for earlier suggestions that post-translational over-modification of a fibrillar collagen can alter the morphology of the fibrils formed. The results also indicate that some of the biological consequences of the mutations in type I procollagen causing heritable disorders must be ascribed to the effects of post-translational over-modifications that frequently occur as secondary consequences of changes in the primary structure of the protein."

Their success has been dramatic but partial and excruciatingly slow, and until recently quite uncoerced by government. Cigarettes and nicotine have characteristics distinct among addictive drugs, and some of these help explain why efforts to quit smoking are so often frustrated. Nicotine itself is the most interesting chemical in the treatment of addiction and, in some forms, can pose a dilemma: compromise by settling for pure nicotine indefinitely, or stay with cigarettes and keep trying to quit. Nicotine is not alone among addictive drugs in becoming increasingly identified with the poorer classes."
https://openalex.org/W1599435087,"Air-breathing organisms experience an elevated concentration of oxygen mainly under two conditions. One occurs at birth when the O2 tension in the lung increases from approximately 25 torr present in utero to approximately 100 torr. The lungs, in particular, are also exposed to hyperoxia when oxygen is administered for therapeutic reasons. Under hyperoxic conditions, increased lung antioxidant enzyme activity is important for survival. The molecular basis for the increase in antioxidant enzyme gene expression under these circumstances is not well understood; in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal rats the elevation of lung catalase activity is not due to an increased rate of transcription but is associated with an increased concentration of catalase mRNA due to enhanced stability of the mRNA (Clerch, L.B., Iqbal, J., and Massaro, D. (1991) Am. J. Physiol. 260, L428-L433). We now show that neonatal rat lung protein forms specific complexes with catalase mRNA; this binding is redox-sensitive since when oxidizing agents are added binding is abolished but is restored by reducing agents. Our data also indicate lungs from hyperoxia-exposed rats have a larger proportion of catalase RNA-binding protein in oxidized form than lungs from air-breathing rats. This redox-sensitive binding of protein to catalase mRNA may be important in the control of catalase gene expression."

Ookinetes (motile zygotes) were seeded onto a murine basement membrane-like gel (Matrigel) in coculture with Drosophila melanogaster cells (Schneider's L2). Transformation into oocysts as well as subsequent growth and differentiation were observed in parasites attached to Matrigel and depended on the presence of L2 cells. Sporozoites were first observed on day 10 in culture. Specific circumsporozoite protein antigenicity was identified in mature oocysts and in sporozoites. It is now possible to follow the entire life cycle of Plasmodium in vitro.
https://openalex.org/W1597771055,"Abstract Whole-cell patch recordings using nystatin permeabilization were made from single human platelets during application of agonists from a puffer pipette. In platelets clamped near the resting potential and bathed in Na+ saline, 40 microM ADP activated a transient inward current within tens of milliseconds. At -73 mV the current lasted between 0.1 and 1 s and had a peak of between 13 and 31 pA in different cells. Ion substitution experiments indicated that the channel is permeable to Na+,K+, and Ba2+ and presumably also to Ca2+, but is not permeable to Cl-. The single channel conductance was 15 pS (near the resting potential) in nominally Ca(2+)-free saline and 11 picosiemens in BaCl2 saline. Thrombin, at 1 unit/ml, did not elicit detectable currents during a 3-s application in platelets bathed in 1 mM Ca2+, Na+ saline. Under the same conditions, in fura-2-loaded cells, thrombin-evoked Ca2+ entry (monitored by Mn2+ quench) was detectable after a delay of 1.4 s. This suggests that early thrombin-evoked Ca2+ entry occurs via small conductance channels, below the resolution of the patch clamp technique, or by an electroneutral pathway. The ADP-evoked channel has the requisite speed of activation to account for the rapid Ca2+ influx observed during stopped-flow studies of agonist-evoked changes in [Ca2+]i."

The calculated NOE effects include consideration of the motions of individual interproton vectors and the anisotropic tumbling of the DNA. The effects due to inclusion of anisotropic tumbling are much larger than those due to the local motion, and both improve the agreement between calculated and experimental results. The predictions based on the dynamical models agree significantly better with experiment than those based on either of the canonical forms or the crystal structure."
https://openalex.org/W1503953699,"A beta-N-Acetylglucosaminide alpha 1----3-fucosyltransferase was purified from human serum by ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, ion-exchange chromatography on sulfopropyl-Sepharose, affinity chromatography on GDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose, and finally high pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration. Gel filtration chromatography of the native enzyme revealed a Mr of 45,000. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified protein also appeared as a single molecular species of Mr 45,000. In contrast to the multisubunit beta-galactoside alpha 1----2-fucosyltransferases with an apparent Mr of 150,000, present in human serum, the native beta-N-acetylglucosaminide alpha 1----3-fucosyltransferase is a monomer with a Mr of 45,000. The enzyme is glycosylated, as revealed by wheat germ agglutinin binding properties. The alpha 1----3 linkage formed by the enzyme between alpha-L-fucose and the penultimate beta-N-acetylglucosamine by the purified enzyme was confirmed by 1H NMR homonuclear cross-irradiation analysis of the oligosaccharide product. The specificity of the purified enzyme is restricted to type 2 structures, as revealed by its reactivity with different substrates and from the Km values calculated from the initial rate data using various oligosaccharide acceptors. The enzyme has the ability to utilize the N-acetyl-beta-lactosamine determinant (Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc) and the sialylated (NeuAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc) and fucosylated (Fuc alpha 1----2Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc) derivatives of N-acetyl-beta-lactosamine and thus is distinct from both the human Lewis gene-encoded enzyme and the alpha 1----3-fucosyltransferase of the myeloid cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1489283282,"Abstract Reduced and denatured hirudin (65 amino acids and 3 disulfides) refolds in vitro to become an active molecule. The folding process adopts a mechanism of trial and error without predominant pathways. Throughout the entire folding process, the 6 cysteines were about equally involved in the disulfide shuffling. Among the first 20% of 3-disulfide species accumulated during the early phase of refolding, two-thirds were inactive and were reshuffled in the presence of thiol catalyst to regain correct disulfide pairing. When refolding was performed in the presence of strong denaturant (guanidinium chloride) without thiol catalyst, 8% of the active hirudin was obtained. This figure is close to the probability (6.7%) that would be expected from the random disulfide pairing of a molecule containing 6 sulfhydryl groups."
https://openalex.org/W1515981942,"The human apolipoprotein B (apoB) promoter region (-150 to +124) is transcriptionally active in HepG2 and CaCo-2 but not in HeLa cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that transcription of the human apoB gene in hepatic cells is achieved through the interaction of proteins that bind to five regulatory elements, I (-118 to -98), II (-112 to -94), III (-86 to -62), IV (-72 to -53), and V (-53 to -33). Elements I, IV, and V can bind to bacterially expressed enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) although with different affinities. In addition, elements I, IV, and V interact with at least two other heat-stable nuclear factors, designated NF-BA2 and NF-BA3, that are distinct from C/EBP. These activities have been separated by ion exchange chromatography and shown to produce footprints in elements I, IV, and V that are similar to those obtained with C/EBP. Element II is recognized by three activities designated NF-BCB1, NF-BCB2, and NF-BCB3, which have been separated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Saturation mutagenesis of the region established that they belong to a family of proteins recognizing the same motif, 5'-AAAAGCAAACAG-3'. Substitution mutations in element II that abolish binding of all three activities in vitro also reduce hepatic transcription in vivo to 10% of control, indicating that the binding of NF-BCB1, NF-BCB2, and NF-BCB3 activities is required for efficient transcription of the apoB gene. Furthermore, element III is recognized by the previously characterized nuclear factor NF-BA1, the binding of which is essential for the transcriptional activation of the apoB gene in hepatic and intestinal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1519810947,"Neutral endopeptidase-24.11 (NEP; EC 3.4.24.11) is an abundant metalloendopeptidase of the brush border membrane of kidney proximal tubules. We have recently shown that NEP is delivered directly to the apical domain of the plasma membrane when expressed in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in culture (Jalal, F., Lemay, G., Zollinger, M., Berteloot, A., Boileau, G., and Crine, P. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19826-19832). Here, a soluble form of NEP consisting of the signal peptide of pro-opiomelanocortin fused in-frame with the ectodomain of NEP has been expressed in MDCK cells. Enzymatic assays performed on apical and basolateral culture media of MDCK cells grown on semi-permeable supports indicated that the recombinant enzyme was predominantly released at the apical surface. In contrast, when the chimeric protein was expressed in NIH 3T3 cells or when pro-opiomelanocortin was expressed in MDCK cells, non-polarized secretion was observed into both the apical and basolateral compartments of the culture chamber. Our results suggest that the ectodomain of NEP is sufficient for directing the targeting of this protein to the apical membrane of polarized MDCK epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1594152786,"The yeast gene encoding the 95-kDa subunit of the class III gene transcription factor TFIIIC was cloned. This gene, termed TFC1 (transcription factor C, gene 1), was isolated by screening a lambda gt11 yeast cDNA expression library using a polyclonal antiserum preparation which was previously shown to specifically recognize the 95-kDa subunit of yeast TFIIIC (Parsons, M. C., and Weil, P. A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5095-5103). TFC1 was found to be a single copy gene which contained a continuous open reading frame about 2 kilobases in length. TFC1 was shown to encode the 95-kDa subunit of TFIIIC by several criteria. Like the authentic yeast protein, the protein encoded by TFC1 had an apparent molecular weight of 95,000. In addition, the protein encoded by the TFC1 gene bound to the same antibody species as the yeast 95-kDa subunit of TFIIIC. Last, the sizes of the cleavage products of the Escherichia coli-expressed protein were indistinguishable from those of the cleavage products of the bona fide yeast 95-kDa protein."
https://openalex.org/W1656151818,"L-A is a 4.6-kilobase double-stranded RNA virus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The in vitro L-A replication reaction ((-)-strand synthesis) requires an internal site 400 bases from the 3' end in addition to the 3'-terminal 30 nucleotides of the L-A (+)-single-stranded RNA. Elimination of the internal site reduces the template activity 5-10-fold. Here we investigate how the internal site can stimulate the replication reaction which starts at the 3' end of the template. When these two sites are split into two distinct RNA molecules, the internal site can no longer stimulate replication (no trans-activation). However, establishment of an intermolecular hydrogen bonding between these RNAs restored the replication-enhancing activity of the internal site. This result is consistent with a model wherein L-A's RNA polymerase interacts first with the internal site and then with the 3' end site by either looping or by a local dissociation-reassociation mechanism. These results, however, clearly eliminate anchored tracking and sliding models which require continuity of the RNA molecule between these two cis sites."
https://openalex.org/W2163080939,"Prolonged thrombin time was completely corrected by the addition of millimolar concentrations of calcium in a new abnormal fibrinogen, Osaka V. Analysis of lysyl endopeptidase digests of A alpha-, B beta-, or gamma-chains by high performance liquid chromatography, and the following amino acid sequence analysis of relevant peptides revealed that about 50% of the gamma-chain has a replacement of gamma-arginine 375 by glycine. When fibrinogen was digested with plasmin in the presence of millimolar concentration of calcium, the amount of fragment D1 was about 50% of the normal control, and the rest was further cleaved to fragment D2, D3, or D62 with an apparent Mr of 62,000. Plasmic digestion of cross-linked fibrin in the presence of calcium resulted in the appearance of an abnormal fragment with an apparent Mr of 123,000 as well as fragments D2, D3, and D62, concomitant with the decrease of D dimer. The gamma-remnant of the abnormal fragment proved to be a cross-linked complex of the normal D1 gamma-remnant and residues 374-406/411 of the abnormal gamma-chain. The number of high affinity Ca(2+)-binding sites for the normal fibrinogen and fibrinogen Osaka V obtained by equilibrium dialysis was 2.88 (about 3) and 1.85, respectively, and that for the abnormal molecules was calculated as 0.9 (about 1) from their relative amounts in the samples, suggesting the lack of two Ca(2+)-binding sites in the D-domains. These data suggest that the normal structure of the COOH-terminal portion of the gamma-chain including residue 375 is required for the full expression of high affinity calcium binding to D-domains, the ability to be protected by calcium against plasmic digestion, and fibrin polymerization. During these studies, we found that the NH2-terminal amino acid of the gamma-remnant in fragments D or D dimer which were obtained after prolonged digestion with plasmin is gamma-Met89."
https://openalex.org/W1482797911,"The Ch21 protein is one of the marker proteins whose synthesis and secretion by differentiating tibia chondrocytes is progressively increased during chicken embryogenesis (Descalzi-Cancedda, F., Manduca, P., Tacchetti, C., Fossa, P., Quarto, R. and Cancedda, R. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 107, 2455-2463). We report the corresponding full-length cDNA sequence and the complete primary structure of the protein, which contains a 20-residue signal peptide. The synthesis of the protein is directed by a 1450-base mRNA characterized by an unusually long 5'-untranslated leader sequence and is regulated only at the transcriptional level as shown by run-off transcription assays. During differentiation, maximal expression of the protein characterizes stage II hypertrophic chondrocytes. In situ hybridization on embryo sections reveals that the protein is expressed by several structures derived from the chondrogenic lineage and that, in addition, it is a major translational product in granulocytes. High cell density largely influences the expression of the Ch21 protein in chondrocyte cultures. When embryonic avian cells of different origin are grown to confluency, the expression of the Ch21 protein is observed in only some of the cell lines. Thus quiescence per se is not the primary factor determining the expression of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1518712848,"A kinetic assay has been developed to measure the strength of natural T7 promoters. By determining the rate of appearance of initiation products in the presence of constant concentrations of T7 RNA polymerase, an incomplete mixture of ribonucleoside triphosphates, and increasing promoter concentrations, a maximum rate of product formation (Vmax) and a promoter concentration giving half of the maximal activity ([P]Vmax/2) can be determined for any cloned T7 promoter. On supercoiled plasmids, it was found that the [P]Vmax/2 measured for the six promoters phi 1.1B, phi 1.3, phi 3.8, phi 6.5, phi 10, and phi 13 ranged from 3.4 +/- 1.1 to 12.0 +/- 2.4 nM while the Vmax values showed no significant trends. On plasmids that had been linearized by cleavage at a single site with a restriction endonuclease, the cloned T7 promoters assayed fell into two broad classes that appear to be characterized by the T7 class II and III promoters. Generally, the class II promoters required higher promoter concentrations to produce half of the maximum rates of initiation ([P]Vmax/2 values) than the class III promoters. The [P]Vmax/2 values for the class II promoters ranged from 20 +/- 2.7 to 23 +/- 3.6 nM, while the [P]Vmax/2 values for the class III promoters phi 10 and phi 13 were 13 +/- 1.6 nM and 7.8 +/- 1.4 nM. The one exception is the class III promoter phi 6.5 whose [P] Vmax/2 (17 +/- 5 nM) falls between the [P]Vmax/2 values of the class II promoters and the strong class III promoters. The Vmax values measured on linear templates are variable, but it appears that phi 10 is more active than the other five promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1605325488,"Although the platelet ADP receptor is thought to exhibit a high degree of structural selectivity, adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATP alpha S) is a potent inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet activation and has been recently shown to bind with high affinity (Kd 3 +/- 0.1 nM) to formaldehyde-fixed platelets and to be photoincorporated into an 18-kDa fragment beginning at Tyr-198 of glycoprotein (GP) IIb alpha (Greco, N. J., Yamamoto, N., Jackson, B. W., Tandon, N. N., Moos, M., Jr., and Jamieson, G. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 13627-13633). Further studies have now shown that guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP alpha S) also binds to high affinity sites (Kd 4.7 +/- 0.9 nM; 13,600 +/- 1,140 sites/platelet) and to low affinity sites (Kd 470 +/- 85 nM; 135,900 +/- 19,400 sites/platelet). Competition binding studies showed that all GTP alpha S binding sites were accessible to ADP and vice versa. The corresponding pyrimidine nucleotide cytidine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (CTP alpha S) was found to be similarly effective in competing in the binding of ADP and both 5'-O-(thiotriphosphates) as well as uridine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (UTP alpha S) were potent inhibitors of platelet shape change and aggregation. Ultraviolet irradiation of platelets in the presence of either [35S]GTP alpha S or [35S]UTP alpha S resulted in their specific incorporation into the alpha chain of GPIIb as previously shown with [35S]ATP alpha S. These results show that the structure of the nucleotide base has little influence on its ability to occupy the ADP-binding site on platelets, to function as an inhibitor of ADP-induced activation or to be photoincorporated into GPIIb alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1497823394,"The rodent beta-tropomyosin (TM) gene produces either a 1.2-kilobase (kb) skeletal muscle beta-TM mRNA or a 1.1-kb fibroblast/smooth muscle TM-1 mRNA through tissue-specific alternative exon splicing and 3' cleavage/polyadenylation at two alternative poly(A) sites. beta-TM mRNA contains exon 6b, 9a, and the poly(A) site immediately following exon 9a, whereas TM-1 mRNA contains exon 6a, 9b, and the poly(A) site following exon 9b. We isolated a novel 2.1-kb beta-TM cDNA clone, pUTM, from a cDNA library of 2-day differentiated mouse BC3H1 muscle-like cells. This cDNA contains the entire sequence of mature beta-TM mRNA with a normal but unused poly(A) site associated with exon 9a. Instead, 3' cleavage/polyadenylation of this cDNA occurred at the exon 9b-associated distal poly(A) site, resulting in the retention of a 1-kb intron and the TM-1 exon 9b. We identified a 2.3-kb functional mRNA, UTM RNA, corresponding to pUTM. UTM RNA appeared early during BC3H1 cell differentiation and gradually decreased as the beta-TM mRNA increased. UTM RNA was also detected in mouse C2C12 muscle cells and in skeletal muscle tissue isolated from mouse leg. Thus, in the processing of beta-TM gene transcripts, selection of alternative terminal exons and alternative poly(A) sites are not necessarily linked as they appear to be in other gene systems."
https://openalex.org/W2117184957,"We report here our initial success in using fluorescence energy transfer to map the position of the subunits of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme within initiation complexes formed on primed DNA. Using primers containing a fluorescent derivative 3 nucleotides from the 3'-terminus and acceptors of fluorescence energy transfer located on Cys333 of the beta subunit, a donor-acceptor distance of 65 A was measured. Coupling this distance with other information enabled us to propose a model for the positioning of beta within initiation complexes. Examination of the fluorescence properties of a labeled primer with the unlabeled beta subunit and other assemblies of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme subunits allowed us to distinguish all of the known intermediates of the holoenzyme-catalyzed reaction. Specific fluorescence changes could be assigned for primer annealing, Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein binding, 3'----5' exonucleolytic hydrolysis of the primer, DNA polymerase III* binding, initiation complex formation upon the addition of beta in the presence of ATP, and DNA elongation. These fluorescence changes are sufficiently large to support future detailed kinetic studies. Particularly interesting was the difference in fluorescence changes accompanying initiation complex formation as compared to binding of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme subunit assemblies. Initiation complex formation resulted in a strong fluorescence enhancement. Binding of DNA polymerase III* led to a fluorescence quenching, and transfer of beta to primed DNA by the gamma delta complex did not change the fluorescence. This demonstrates a rearrangement of subunits accompanying initiation complex formation. Monitoring fluorescence changes with labeled beta, we have determined that beta binds with a stoichiometry of one monomer/primer terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1734654270,"Most actins examined to date undergo a unique posttranslational modification termed processing, catalyzed by the actin N-acetylaminopeptidase. Processing is the removal of acetylmethionine from the amino terminus in class I actins with Met-Asp(Glu) amino termini. For class II actins with Met-X-Asp(Glu) amino termini, processing is the removal of the second residue as an N-acetylamino acid. Other cytosolic proteins with these amino termini are not processed suggesting that the reaction may be specific for actins. In actin, X is usually cysteine. However, there are some class II actins in which this residue is other than cysteine, suggesting a broader substrate specificity for actin N-acetylaminopeptidase than acetylmethionine or acetylcysteine. We constructed mutant actins in which this cysteine was replaced with serine, asparagine, glycine, aspartic acid, histidine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine and used these to determine the substrate specificity of rat liver actin N-acetylaminopeptidase in vitro. Amino-terminal acetylmethinonine was cleaved from adjacent aspartic acid, asparagine, or histidine, but not serine, glycine, phenylalanine, or tyrosine. Of the acetylated actin amino termini tested, only acetylmethionine and acetylcysteine were cleaved. Histidine was never N-acetylated and was not cleaved. When phenylalanine and tyrosine were adjacent to the initiator methionine, no initiator methionine was cleaved even though it was acetylated. These results suggest a narrow substrate specificity for the rat liver actin N-acetylaminopeptidase. They also demonstrate that the adjacent residue can effect actin N-acetylaminopeptidase specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1573511081,"The P2 region of group I introns has been proposed to be involved in the correct positioning of the P1 5'-splice site duplex in the catalytic core (Michel, F., and Westhof, E. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 216, 585-610). The behavior of delta P2 deletion mutants of the td intron is consistent with this hypothesis. The delta P2 mutants are capable of site-specific hydrolysis, indicating that the conformation of the ribozyme is not grossly altered, but they are incapable of transesterification reactions at the splice sites, as would be predicted if P1 is not appropriately aligned within the catalytic core. Nevertheless, the function of the P2 element can be bypassed in specific pseudorevertants isolated by genetic selection from the delta P2 mutants. These results, together with phylogenetic data, support the existence of alternate strategies to create a functional P1-core interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1590050867,"We have previously shown that when rat hepatocytes are incubated with 4 mM azide, which reduces the intracellular ATP concentration to about 30% of its normal level, secretory proteins are reversibly arrested within the cell. Analysis of haptoglobin after 150 min of azide incubation shows that its carbohydrates have been processed by Golgi enzymes (Persson, R., Ahlstrom, E., and Fries, E. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 107, 2503-2510). Here, we have further characterized the site of arrest. Subcellular fractionation by density gradient centrifugation showed that albumin and haptoglobin fractionated like a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum. Localization of albumin by immunoelectron microscopy showed, however, that it occurred in flattened cisternae and that the endoplasmic reticulum was devoid of the protein. A possible explanation for these results is that the azide treatment blocks transport through the Golgi complex, leading to an accumulation of secretory proteins in a pre- or early Golgi compartment of high density. This compartment could contain sufficient amounts of Golgi enzymes to carry out the observed carbohydrate processing upon prolonged incubation or possibly acquire them as an effect of the azide treatment."
