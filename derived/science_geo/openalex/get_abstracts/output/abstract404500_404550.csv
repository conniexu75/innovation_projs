https://openalex.org/W1974540615,"Plants and their arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal symbionts interact in complex underground networks involving multiple partners. This increases the potential for exploitation and defection by individuals, raising the question of how partners maintain a fair, two-way transfer of resources. We manipulated cooperation in plants and fungal partners to show that plants can detect, discriminate, and reward the best fungal partners with more carbohydrates. In turn, their fungal partners enforce cooperation by increasing nutrient transfer only to those roots providing more carbohydrates. On the basis of these observations we conclude that, unlike many other mutualisms, the symbiont cannot be ""enslaved."" Rather, the mutualism is evolutionarily stable because control is bidirectional, and partners offering the best rate of exchange are rewarded."

https://openalex.org/W4235232179,"Antibody VRC01 is a human immunoglobulin that neutralizes about 90% of HIV-1 isolates. To understand how such broadly neutralizing antibodies develop, we used x-ray crystallography and 454 pyrosequencing to characterize additional VRC01-like antibodies from HIV-1-infected individuals. Crystal structures revealed a convergent mode of binding for diverse antibodies to the same CD4-binding-site epitope. A functional genomics analysis of expressed heavy and light chains revealed common pathways of antibody-heavy chain maturation, confined to the IGHV1-2*02 lineage, involving dozens of somatic changes, and capable of pairing with different light chains. Broadly neutralizing HIV-1 immunity associated with VRC01-like antibodies thus involves the evolution of antibodies to a highly affinity-matured state required to recognize an invariant viral structure, with lineages defined from thousands of sequences providing a genetic roadmap of their development."

https://openalex.org/W2071921522,"The microtubule-associated protein Tau plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and several related disorders (tauopathies). In the disease Tau aggregates and becomes hyperphosphorylated forming paired helical and straight filaments, which can further condense into higher order neurofibrillary tangles in neurons. The development of this pathology is consistently associated with progressive neuronal loss and cognitive decline. The identification of tractable therapeutic targets in this pathway has been challenging, and consequently very few clinical studies addressing Tau pathology are underway. Recent active immunization studies have raised the possibility of modulating Tau pathology by activating the immune system. Here we report for the first time on passive immunotherapy for Tau in two well established transgenic models of Tau pathogenesis. We show that peripheral administration of two antibodies against pathological Tau forms significantly reduces biochemical Tau pathology in the JNPL3 mouse model. We further demonstrate that peripheral administration of the same antibodies in the more rapidly progressive P301S tauopathy model not only reduces Tau pathology quantitated by biochemical assays and immunohistochemistry, but also significantly delays the onset of motor function decline and weight loss. This is accompanied by a reduction in neurospheroids, providing direct evidence of reduced neurodegeneration. Thus, passive immunotherapy is effective at preventing the buildup of intracellular Tau pathology, neurospheroids, and associated symptoms, although the exact mechanism remains uncertain. Tau immunotherapy should therefore be considered as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2058708681,"The nematic phase transition in electronic liquids, driven by Coulomb interactions, represents a new class of strongly correlated electronic ground states. We studied suspended samples of bilayer graphene, annealed so that it achieves very high quasiparticle mobilities. Bilayer graphene is a truly two-dimensional material with complex chiral electronic spectra and the high quality of our samples allowed us to observe strong spectrum reconstructions and electron topological transitions that can be attributed to a nematic phase transition and a decrease in rotational symmetry. These results are especially surprising because no interaction effects have been observed so far in bilayer graphene in the absence of an applied magnetic field."

https://openalex.org/W2029856864,"Type Ia supernovae are key tools for measuring distances on a cosmic scale. They are generally thought to be the thermonuclear explosion of an accreting white dwarf in a close binary system. The nature of the mass donor is still uncertain. In the single-degenerate model it is a main-sequence star or an evolved star, whereas in the double-degenerate model it is another white dwarf. We show that the velocity structure of absorbing material along the line of sight to 35 type Ia supernovae tends to be blueshifted. These structures are likely signatures of gas outflows from the supernova progenitor systems. Thus, many type Ia supernovae in nearby spiral galaxies may originate in single-degenerate systems."

https://openalex.org/W1988701300,"Our previous studies demonstrated a high fat diet-resistant lean phenotype of vitamin D receptor (VDR)-null mutant mice mainly due to increased energy expenditure, suggesting an involvement of the VDR in energy metabolism. Here, we took a transgenic approach to further define the role of VDR in adipocyte biology. We used the aP2 gene promoter to target the expression of the human (h) VDR in adipocytes in mice. In contrast to the VDR-null mice, the aP2-hVDR Tg mice developed obesity compared with the wild-type counterparts without changes in food intake. The increase in fat mass was mainly due to markedly reduced energy expenditure, which was correlated with decreased locomotive activity and reduced fatty acid β-oxidation and lipolysis in the adipose tissue in the transgenic mice. Consistently, the expression of genes involved in the regulation of fatty acid transport, thermogenesis, and lipolysis were suppressed in the transgenic mice. Taken together, these data confirm an important role of the VDR in the regulation of energy metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2165134974,"TMEM16A (ANO1) is a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) expressed in secretory epithelia, smooth muscle, and other tissues. Cell-based functional screening of ~110,000 compounds revealed compounds that activated TMEM16A CaCC conductance without increasing cytoplasmic Ca2+. By patch-clamp, N-aroylaminothiazole “activators” (Eact) strongly increased Cl- current at 0 Ca2+, whereas tetrazolylbenzamide “potentiators” (Fact) were not active at 0 Ca2+ but reduced the EC50 for Ca2+-dependent TMEM16A activation. Of 682 analogs tested, the most potent activator (Eact) and potentiator (Fact) produced large and more sustained CaCC Cl-currents than general agonists of Ca2+ signaling, with EC50 3–6 μM and Cl- conductance comparable to that induced transiently by Ca2+-elevating purinergic agonists. Analogs of activators were identified that fully inhibited TMEM16A Cl- conductance, providing further evidence for direct TMEM16A binding. The TMEM16A activators increased CaCC conductance in human salivary and airway submucosal gland epithelial cells, and IL-4 treated bronchial cells, and stimulated submucosal gland secretion in human bronchi and smooth muscle contraction in mouse intestine. Small-molecule, TMEM16A-targeted activators may be useful for drug therapy of cystic fibrosis, dry mouth, and gastrointestinal hypomotility disorders, and for pharmacological dissection of TMEM16A function.—Namkung, W., Yao, Z., Finkbeiner, W.

https://openalex.org/W2169139395,"The nervous system is classically organized into sympathetic and parasympathetic systems acting in opposition to maintain physiological homeostasis. Here, we report that both systems converge in the activation of β2-adrenoceptors of splenic regulatory lymphocytes to control systemic inflammation. Vagus nerve stimulation fails to control serum TNF levels in either β2-knockout or lymphocyte-deficient nude mice. Unlike typical suppressor CD25(+) cells, the transfer of CD4(+)CD25(-) regulatory lymphocytes reestablishes the anti-inflammatory potential of the vagus nerve and β2-agonists to control inflammation in both β2-knockout and nude mice. β2-Agonists inhibit cytokine production in splenocytes (IC(50)≈ 1 μM) and prevent systemic inflammation in wild-type but not in β2-knockout mice. β2-Agonists rescue wild-type mice from established polymicrobial peritonitis in a clinically relevant time frame. Regulatory lymphocytes reestablish the anti-inflammatory potential of β2-agonists to control systemic inflammation, organ damage, and lethal endotoxic shock in β2-knockout mice. These results indicate that β2-adrenoceptors in regulatory lymphocytes are critical for the anti-inflammatory potential of the parasympathetic vagus nerve, and they represent a potential pharmacological target for sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2038315117,"We have recently discovered that the insulin-like growth factor receptor I (IGF-IR) is up-regulated in human invasive bladder cancer and promotes migration and invasion of transformed urothelial cells. The proteoglycan decorin, a key component of the tumor stroma, can positively regulate the IGF-IR system in normal cells. However, there are no available data on the role of decorin in modulating IGF-IR activity in transformed cells or in tumor models. Here we show that the expression of decorin inversely correlated with IGF-IR expression in low and high grade bladder cancers (n = 20 each). Decorin bound with high affinity IGF-IR and IGF-I at distinct sites and negatively regulated IGF-IR activity in urothelial cancer cells. Nanomolar concentrations of decorin promoted down-regulation of IRS-1, one of the critical proteins of the IGF-IR pathway, and attenuated IGF-I-dependent activation of Akt and MAPK. This led to decorin-evoked inhibition of migration and invasion upon IGF-I stimulation. Notably, decorin did not cause down-regulation of the IGF-IR in bladder, breast, and squamous carcinoma cells. This indicates that decorin action on the IGF-IR differs from its known activity on other receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGF receptor and Met. Our results provide a novel mechanism for decorin in negatively modulating both IGF-I and its receptor. Thus, decorin loss may contribute to increased IGF-IR activity in the progression of bladder cancer and perhaps other forms of cancer where IGF-IR plays a role.

Thus, decorin loss may contribute to increased IGF-IR activity in the progression of bladder cancer and perhaps other forms of cancer where IGF-IR plays a role. Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United States with 70,530 estimated cases and 14,680 estimated deaths in 2010 (1Jemal A. Siegel R. Xu J. Ward E. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2010; 60: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (12425) Google Scholar). Regardless of treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy, bladder cancers often recur and metastasize to distant sites. The prognosis for low grade tumors is generally good, but ∼10–15% of these patients later develop invasive disease. Prognosis of high grade tumors is instead much less favorable, with only 50% survival at 5 years (2Knowles M.A. Int. J. Clin. Oncol. 2008; 13: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 3Mitra A.P. Cote R.J. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2009; 4: 251-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Invasive tumors frequently progress to life-threatening metastasis, which is associated with a 5-year survival rate of 6% (2Knowles M.A. Int. J. Clin. Oncol. 2008; 13: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the mechanisms that regulate bladder tumor invasion and metastasis is crucial to both outcome prediction and improvement of treatment for this devastating disease.

Mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the Igf1r gene exhibit severe growth retardation and die shortly after birth because of respiratory failure (9Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3128-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). IGF-IR plays also an essential role in transformation, as suggested by experiments performed on fibroblasts derived from Igf1r−/− mice. These cells were refractory to transformation induced by several tumorigenic agents (viral oncogenes, including Ras, SV40 large T Ag and overexpressed epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, and various chemical agents) but were transformed when the Igf1r was re-expressed (7Baserga R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5574-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Further experimental and epidemiological studies have confirmed that activation of IGF-IR is involved in the development of many common neoplastic diseases, including carcinomas of the lungs, prostate, pancreas, liver, colon, and breast (12Le Roith D. Karas M. Yakar S. Qu B.H. Wu Y. Blakesley V.A. Isr. Med. Assoc. J. 1999; 1: 25-30PubMed Google Scholar). The transforming potential of the IGF-IR likely depends on its ability to protect from apoptosis (13Le Roith D. Growth Horm. IGF. Res. 2000; 10: S12-S13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to induce cell motility (14Guvakova M.A. Surmacz E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Mauro L.

In some experimental models, increased cell migration mediated by the activation of the IGF-IR has been directly linked to tumor progression (16Doerr M.E. Jones J.I. J. Biol.

Consequently, the IGF-IR has become a very attractive target for cancer therapy, and in fact antibodies against the IGF-IR are currently in Phase I clinical trials (18Chitnis M.M. Yuen J.S.

These effects require the activation of Akt and MAPK pathways, and the binding of IGF-I to IGF-IR induces Akt- and MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of paxillin, which is necessary for promoting motility (19Metalli D.

Remarkably, mice lacking both the Dcn and p53 genes show a faster rate of tumor development and succumb almost uniformly to a very aggressive form of thymic lymphomas within 6 months.

However, all of these studies were performed with “normal” cells, and therefore there are no published data on the role of decorin in modulating cancer growth via the IGF-IR in transformed cells or in tumor models. Here, we show that the IGF-IR is markedly up-regulated in high grade compared with low grade bladder cancer tissues. In contrast, decorin expression is lost in bladder tumor tissues, suggesting that decorin loss may modulate IGF-IR activity. We further demonstrate that decorin binds with high affinity for both the IGF-IR and IGF-I at distinct sites and represses IGF-IR activity in urothelial cancer cells. In addition, decorin inhibits IGF-I-dependent activation of downstream effectors proteins, thereby counteracting cancer cell migration and invasion. Thus, decorin may work as a natural IGF-IR antagonist contributing to IGF-IR-dependent progression in bladder cancer and perhaps other types of tumors where IGF-IR plays a role. Urothelial carcinoma-derived human 5637 and T24 cells, as well as MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells and HeLa squamous carcinoma cells, were obtained from ATCC. 5637 and T24 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS. MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Serum-free medium (SFM) is DMEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 50 μg/ml of transferrin (Sigma-Aldrich). Human recombinant decorin proteoglycan and protein core were produced as described before (48Goldoni S. Owens R.T. McQuillan D.J. Shriver Z. Sasisekharan R. Birk D.E. Campbell S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6606-6612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, decorin-expressing 293-EBNA cells were created by transferring the vaccinia decorin construct into the pCEP4 (Invitrogen) expression vector. Following transfection, stable expressing cells were selected with hygromycin. The cells were then grown to saturation in the Celligen Plus bioreactor and protein production achieved by switching to serum-free culture medium. Conditioned medium was collected every 48 h. Following concentration of the conditioned medium using a Pellicon 2 tangential flow system (Millipore, Bedford, MA), recombinant decorin was purified as described above. Both expression systems resulted in the production of protein cores and proteoglycan forms of decorin. In some experiments, the protein core was separated from proteoglycan following anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose and elution with a linear gradient of 0.15–2 m NaCl in PBS, 0.2% CHAPS. Protein core samples were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography before and after dialysis against water and freeze-drying. Dried proteins were resuspended in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) and chromatographed on Superose 6 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) in TBS with or without 2.5 m GdnHCl. Human recombinant IGF-IR was purchased from R & D Systems (305-GR) and consisted of a ∼104-kDa single chain polypeptide with a ∼81-kDa α subunit (containing the ligand-binding domain of the receptor) and a 23-kDa β subunit of the IGF-IR. Immunohistochemical analysis of IGF-IR levels in bladder tissues was performed as previously described (19Metalli D. Lovat F. Tripodi F. Genua M. Xu S.Q. Spinelli M. Alberghina L. Vanoni M. Baffa R.

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from 20 high grade and 20 low grade urothelial cell carcinomas and adjacent normal tissues were obtained from the Pathology Tissue Bank of Thomas Jefferson University. Informed consent to use excess pathological specimens for research purposes was obtained from all patients. The slides were incubated with 1:500 dilution of an anti-human IGF-IR antibody (clone G11; Ventana Medical System) as described (19Metalli D. Lovat F. Tripodi F. Genua M. Xu S.Q. Spinelli M.

Decorin expression was detected using a rabbit affinity-purified anti-decorin antibody that recognizes the first 17 amino acids of the decorin protein core as described before (28Goldoni S.

IGF-IR samples were dichotomized into IGF-IR low (<30% cancer cell positivity) or IGF-IR high (>30% cancer cell positivity). For decorin, samples were dichotomized as negative (0) or weak (<30% stromal cell positivity) or strong (>30% of stromal cell positivity). At least 10 independent fields/case were examined and statistically evaluated as described below. The ONCOMINE database and gene microarray analysis tool, a repository for published cDNA microarray data (50Rhodes D.R. Yu J. Shanker K. Deshpande N. Varambally R. Ghosh D. Barrette T. Pandey A.

Statistical analysis of the differences in decorin expression between the aforementioned tissues was accomplished through use of ONCOMINE algorithms, which allow for multiple comparisons among different studies (50Rhodes D.R.

Only studies with statistical analysis giving p < 0.05 were considered. Decorin protein core binding to the IGF-IR was assessed by ELISA assay. Briefly, purified IGF-IR (100 ng/well) was allowed to adhere to wells overnight at room temperature in the presence of carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The plates were washed with PBS and incubated over night with serial dilutions of decorin core (from 0.2 to 400 nm). After ligand incubation, the plates were extensively washed with PBS, blocked with PBS and 1% BSA, and incubated with primary antibody against the N terminus of decorin and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Signal was developed using Sigma-Fast tablets (Sigma-Aldrich) and read at A450 nm. Serial dilutions of decorin protein core made in PBS were tested. Additional binding assays were performed mixing a constant concentration of decorin protein core (10 nm) with increasing concentrations of ZnCl2 (from 0 to 120 μm). Decorin protein core binding with IGF-I was performed as described above, but the plates were coated with IGF-I (100 ng/ml) instead. In the displacement assay, plates were coated with IGF-IR (100 ng/ml) and then incubated with decorin protein core at a constant concentration (20 nm) together with IGF-I at increasing concentrations (0–400 nm). Approximately 5 × 104 5637 cells were plated on 4-well chamber slides (BD Bioscences) and grown to full confluence in RPMI with 10% FBS at 37 °C. The cells were switched to RPMI serum-free medium 18 h prior to treatment with 50 ng/ml of IGF-I (R & D Systems), 200 nm decorin, or a combination of both for 10 and 60 min. The slides were then put on ice, rinsed twice with cold 1× PBS, and fixed/permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 10 min. Subsequently, the slides were incubated with anti-IGF-IR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-caveolin-1 (BD Biosciences) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, detection was determined using goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 488 and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor® 564 (Invitrogen). Confocal analysis was performed on an Olympus IX70 microscope driven by Laser Sharp 2000 image software. The filters were set to 488 and 564 nm for dual channel imaging. All of the images were then analyzed using Image J and Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) software. Serum-starved 5637 and T24 cells were preincubated with decorin at the designated concentrations (50–200 nm) for 1 h and then incubated with either SFM, IGF-I (50 ng/ml), IGF-I and decorin, or decorin alone for 10 min. To test the effect of decorin binding to the ligand, IGF-I was preincubated with 50–200 nm decorin core and then supplemented to cells. IGF-IR phosphorylation was detected by immunoblot using anti-phospho-Tyr1135/6 IGF-IR antibodies (R & D Systems). Total IGF-IR was assessed using anti-IGF-IR polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total IGF-IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2 levels were determined after 24 h of IGF-I stimulation with or without 200 nm decorin. IGF-IR levels in 5637 cells were also assessed after 48 and 72 h. Anti-IRS-1 and anti-IRS-2 polyclonal antibodies were from Millipore. β-Actin was detected using anti-β-actin polyclonal antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). The blots are representative of three independent experiments. Migration experiments were performed using HTS FluoroBloksTM inserts (Becton Dickinson) as previously described (19Metalli D. Lovat F.

The membranes were mounted on a slide, and migrated cells were counted and photographed with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M cell live microscope at the Kimmel Cancer Center Bioimaging Facility.

After 24 h, the filters were washed, fixed, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The cells that had invaded to the lower surface of the filter were counted under the microscope. Serum-starved 5637 were preincubated with decorin for 1 h and then stimulated with IGF-I (50 ng/ml), IGF-I and decorin, or decorin alone for 10 min. The activation of p90RSK, Akt, ERK1/2, and p70S6k protein was analyzed by Western immunoblot using the PathScan Multiplex Western Mixture I (Cell Signaling Technology). ElF4E protein was used as a control to monitor the loading of the samples. Densitometric analysis was performed using the Image J program. The experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated at least three times. The results are expressed as means ± S.E. All of the statistical analyses were carried out with SigmaStat for Windows version 3.10 (Systat Software, Inc., Port Richmond, CA). The results were compared using the two-sided Student's t test. The differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. We have recently demonstrated that the IGF-IR is overexpressed in invasive bladder cancer tissues and promotes cell motility and invasion of bladder cancer cells (19Metalli D. Lovat F. Tripodi F.

https://openalex.org/W2073170210,"The membrane glycoprotein CD200 is expressed on several cell types, including neurons, whereas expression of its receptor, CD200R, is restricted principally to cells of the myeloid lineage, including microglia. The interaction between CD200 and CD200R maintains microglia and macrophages in a quiescent state; therefore, CD200-deficient mice express an inflammatory phenotype exhibiting increased macrophage or microglial activation in models of arthritis, encephalitis, and uveoretinitis. Here, we report that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Pam(3)CysSerLys(4) exerted more profound effects on release of the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), in glia prepared from CD200(-/-) mice compared with wild type mice. This effect is explained by the loss of CD200 on astrocytes, which modulates microglial activation. Expression of Toll-like receptors 4 and 2 (TLR4 and -2) was increased in glia prepared from CD200(-/-) mice, and the evidence indicates that microglial activation, assessed by the increased numbers of CD11b(+) cells that stained positively for both MHCII and CD40, was enhanced in CD200(-/-) mice compared with wild type mice. These neuroinflammatory changes were associated with impaired long term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 of hippocampal slices prepared from CD200(-/-) mice. One possible explanation for this is the increase in TNFα in hippocampal tissue prepared from CD200(-/-) mice because TNFα application inhibited LTP in CA1. Significantly, LPS and Pam(3)CysSerLys(4), at concentrations that did not affect LTP in wild type mice, inhibited LTP in slices prepared from CD200(-/-) mice, probably due to the accompanying increase in TLR2 and TLR4. Thus, the neuroinflammatory changes that result from CD200 deficiency have a negative impact on synaptic plasticity."

The first steps of wood evolution are unknown. We describe two small Early Devonian (407 to 397 million years ago) plants with secondary xylem including simple rays. Their wood currently represents the earliest evidence of secondary growth in plants. The small size of the plants and the presence of thick-walled cortical cells confirm that wood early evolution was driven by hydraulic constraints rather than by the necessity of mechanical support for increasing height. The plants described here are most probably precursors of lignophytes."
https://openalex.org/W2133277178,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in both physiological and pathological apoptosis. ER stress triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can then initiate apoptosis, when the cell fails to restore ER homeostasis. However, the mechanism employed by the UPR to lead cells into apoptosis is unknown. Among the three proximal sensors of ER stress, activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) is specifically activated in apoptotic myoblasts during myoblast differentiation. This implies that active ATF6 has the ability to mediate apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of active ATF6 induced apoptosis in myoblast cells. Moreover, coexpression of a dominant negative form of ATF6 suppressed apoptosis. This suggested that apoptosis-related pathways depended on ATF6-mediated transcription activation. ATF6 caused up-regulation of the WBP1 (WW domain binding protein 1), probably via an indirect mechanism. Furthermore, WBP1 was also found to be proapoptotic. The silencing of WBP1 with small hairpin RNAs caused partial, but significant suppression of ATF6-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of active ATF6 or WBP1 caused a specific reduction in an anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1). This suggested a molecular link between the UPR and an apoptosis regulator. Neither Bcl-2 nor Bcl-xL were reduced upon apoptosis induction in C2C12 cells that overexpressed ATF6 or WBP1. Cells treated with ER stressors underwent apoptosis concomitant with an up-regulation of WBP1 and suppression of Mcl-1.

Xu W. Reed J.C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 1013-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). ER stress triggers an evolutionarily conserved response termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) (2Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4929) Google Scholar). The UPR alters transcriptional and translational programs to cope with the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins. Failure to resolve a protein-folding defect and restore ER homeostasis induces the UPR to initiate apoptosis. This protects the organism by removing the stressed cell (2Ron D. Walter P. Nat. Rev.

ER stress-induced apoptosis is involved in many diseases (1Kim I. Xu W. Reed J.C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 1013-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar), but it is also observed during normal development (4Nakanishi K. Sudo T. Morishima N. J.

The UPR is mediated by three ER-resident transmembrane proteins that sense ER stress and signal downstream pathways. These proximal sensors include the kinase and ribonuclease IRE1, the eIF2α kinase PERK, and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) (5Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). ER stress induces the autophosphorylation and activation of IRE1 and PERK, which results in the activation of downstream transcription factors. In addition, ER stress leads to ATF6 transit through the Golgi complex, where it is sequentially cleaved for activation by the proteases S1P and S2P (6Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). The cleaved N-terminal ATF6 cytoplasmic domain is released from the Golgi membrane, and it translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcription. These three sensor proteins comprise parallel pathways connected by signaling cross-talk through gene expression (7Rutkowski D.T. Hegde R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed that link the distressed ER to apoptosis, including the activation of transcription factors and expression of Bcl-2 family proteins. However, the mechanism triggered by the UPR that eventually leads to apoptosis after prolonged ER stress is unknown (8Xu C. Bailly-Maitre B. Reed J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 2656-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). For example, in some experimental settings, overexpression of a protein homologous to CHOP (CCAAT enhancer-binding protein, also known as GADD153) may be involved. CHOP is an ER stress-inducible member of the C/EBP family of bZIP transcription factors that induces apoptosis through a Bcl-2 inhibitable mechanism (9Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar, 10McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.O. Aw T.Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). However, CHOP−/− cells are only partially resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis. This observation suggested that a CHOP-independent mechanism can also induce apoptosis in response to ER stress. In a previous study, a genome-wide screen of an RNAi library did not identify any genes associated with ER stress-induced apoptosis in HeLa cell derivatives (11Tsujii H. Eguchi Y. Chenchik A. Mizutani T. Yamada K. Tsujimoto Y. J. Biochem. 2010; 148: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This may reflect multiplicity in apoptotic signal transduction during ER stress-induced apoptosis. Multiplicity may occur because ER stressors used in typical experiments activate all three arms of the UPR. We previously showed that ER stress signaling was involved in the induction of developmental apoptosis in muscle tissues through the activation of caspase-12 (4Nakanishi K. Sudo T. Morishima N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Myoblast cells exhibit considerable morphological changes during myogenesis, and they fuse into multinucleated myotubes. Myoblast fusion is associated with apoptosis in a subpopulation of cells (12Fidzianska A. Goebel H.H. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 81: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that has long been considered an example of cell degeneration during normal vertebrate ontogeny (13Glücksmann A. Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 1951; 26: 59-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Our previous study suggested that, during myogenesis, ER stress signaling is mediated mainly by ATF6. When C2C12 mouse myoblast cells were cultured under differentiation conditions, we observed specific activation of the ATF6 pathway in dying cells, but not the IRE1 or PERK pathways (4Nakanishi K. Sudo T. Morishima N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). When a specific inhibitor of S1P was added, these cells were resistant to apoptosis; moreover, concomitant with the reduction in cell death, we found no detectable activation of ATF6 (4Nakanishi K. Sudo T. Morishima N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to explore the possibility that active ATF6 has the ability to mediate apoptosis on its own. In the present study, we examined the effect of forced expression of active ATF6 in C2C12 cells without simultaneously activating all three proximal arms of the UPR. FANTOM3 cDNA clones of ATF6, WBP1, CDKap2, Creld2, Sel1, Tmem50b, PDCD4, and arginine rich, mutated in early stage of tumors (ARMET) were obtained from the Genome Exploration Research Group, Genomic Sciences Center of RIKEN (14Carninci P.

CHOP, Mcl (myeloid cell leukemia sequence)-1, and Aloxe3 cDNAs were amplified by PCR from mouse pancreas cDNA pools (Zyagen). Human ATF6 cDNA was kindly provided by R. Prywes (Columbia University, Biological Sciences). cDNAs were cloned into a variety of vectors, including pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen), pEGFPC1, pEGFPN3, and pDsRed-Monomer-C1 (Clontech). C2C12 cells (RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) were grown in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) with 20% FBS (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 as described previously (4Nakanishi K. Sudo T. Morishima N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 and COS-1 cells were grown in DMEM medium with 10% FBS. mIMCD-3 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in DMEM:F12 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS. MCF-7 cells (Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Tohoku University) were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS. Cell treatment with ER stressors was performed as described previously (15Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Cell transfection was performed with Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) (16Morishima N.

C2C12 cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were electroporated with 10 μg of DNA with a Microporator MP-100 (Invitrogen) and 100-μl microporation tips, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Six to eight h after electroporation, dead cells (floating cells) were removed by suction, and electroporated cells were incubated in fresh medium. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (16Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Tsuchiya K. Shibata T. Seiwa E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50375-50381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). More than 200 GFP-positive cells were randomly selected from each transfection experiment, and dead cells were identified by their morphology (small, round cells). Dead cells also showed nuclear condensation, a hallmark of apoptosis, detected by staining with 1 μg/ml Hoechst dye 33342 (Fig. 1B). Some dead cells underwent membrane blebbing (Fig. 1C). Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. All bar graphs represent n = 3 for each experimental group. Significant differences among groups were determined by analysis of variance followed by the Student's t test. Twenty-four h after electroporation, total RNA was isolated with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). First- and second-strand cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with the One-cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cRNA was synthesized and labeled with biotinylated UTP by in vitro transcription with the in vitro transcription labeling kit (Affymetrix) and the T7 promoter-coupled double-stranded cDNA as template. The labeled cRNA was separated from unincorporated ribonucleotides by filtering through an in vitro transcription cRNA cleanup spin column (Affymetrix). Biotin-labeled cRNAs were hybridized to GeneChip Mouse Genome 430a 2.0 Array chips (Affymetrix) and analyzed with the GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix). Raw expression data were generated with GeneSpring software (Silicon Genetics). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT with TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression levels were calculated with standard curves generated by serial dilution of cDNA isolated from C2C12 cells. Each cDNA sample was diluted with EASY Dilution (Takara Bio) and analyzed in triplicate. To determine relative gene expression, the expression of GAPDH was used as an internal standard. The expression of each gene was assessed by three independent PCR analyses. cDNA sequences were analyzed by TMpred software. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer that contained COMPLETE protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was quantified with a protein assay (Bio-Rad), and BSA was used as a standard. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (4Nakanishi K. Sudo T. Morishima N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For several experiments, dead cells were separated from live cells for sample preparation (16Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Tsuchiya K. Shibata T. Seiwa E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50375-50381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Dead cells (floating) were isolated from the culture medium after centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. After several washes, live cells were scraped from culture dishes. Images were captured with an ORCA-ER cooled charge-coupled camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) mounted on an IX70 microscope (Olympus Optical Co.). All images were captured at either 20-fold or 40-fold magnification with Plan-SemiApochromat objective lenses (20×, 0.40 numerical aperture; 40×, 0.60 numerical aperture). Images were acquired and processed with IPLab software (Scanalytics, Inc.). C2C12 cells were grown in four-chamber slides (Nalge-Nunc), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 (4Nakanishi K. Sudo T. Morishima N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Fixed, permeabilized cells were blocked in PBS that contained 3% BSA (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Sar1 antibody in blocking solution. Immunoreactivity was detected with a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and Alexa Fluor 594-streptavidin (Molecular Probes). Immunostained images were captured with an FV1000D confocal microscope (Olympus). All images were captured at 60-fold magnification with a PLAPON 60× oil objective lens (1.42 numerical aperture). Images were acquired and processed with FV10-ASW software (Olympus). Selected images were pseudo-colored for presentation in ImageJ software. The primary antibodies for immunostaining were as follows: anti-Mcl-1 (Epitomics), anti-Bcl-xL (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Bcl-2 (Medical & Biological Laboratories), anti-caspase-12 (17Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar), anti-active caspase-9 and anti-caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), anti-CHOP and anti-α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GAPDH (Chemicon), anti-GFP (Molecular Probes), anti-BiP (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-WBP1 (ProteinTech), and anti-Sar1 (Abcam). The following pairs of synthetic DNAs were annealed and cloned into the pGeneClip hMGFP vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The MGFP coding region was deleted to make an shRNA plasmid for co-transfection with GFP-ATF6(1–360). The following primers were used: WBP1 version A (sense, TCTCGGACTGTCCTCATCCTCTTTACTTCCTGTCATAAAGAGGATGAGGACAGTCCCT; and antisense, CTGCAGGGACTGTCCTCATCCTCTTTATGACAGGAAGTAAAGAGGATGAGGACAGTCC); WBP1 version C (sense, TCTCGGCTAAACTCAGGCTGCAACACTTCCTGTCATGTTGCAGCCTGAGTTTAGCCCT; and antisense, CTGCAGGGCTAAACTCAGGCTGCAACATGACAGGAAGTGTTGCAGCCTGAGTTTAGCC); Mcl-1 version A (sense, TCTCGCGTAAACCAAGAAAGCTTCACTTCCTGTCATGAAGCTTTCTTGGTTTACGCCT; and antisense, CTGCAGGCGTAAACCAAGAAAGCTTCATGACAGGAAGTGAAGCTTTCTTGGTTTACGC); Mcl-1 version B (sense, TCTCGCTGGTCTGGCATATCTAATACTTCCTGTCATATTAGATATGCCAGACCAGCCT; and antisense, CTGCAGGCTGGTCTGGCATATCTAATATGACAGGAAGTATTAGATATGCCAGACCAGC); and Mcl-1 version C (sense, TCTCGGACTGGCTTGTCAAACAAAGCTTCCTGTCACTTTGTTTGACAAGCCAGTCCCT; and antisense, CTGCAGGGACTGGCTTGTCAAACAAAGTGACAGGAAGCTTTGTTTGACAAGCCAGTCC). The mature form of human ATF6 comprises amino acids 1–373 (18Thuerauf D.J. Morrison L.E. Hoover H. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20734-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); this corresponds to amino acids 1–360 of mouse ATF6 (supplemental Fig. 1). When the mature form of mouse ATF6 was N-terminally tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP-ATF6(1–360)) and transiently transfected into C2C12 cells, it induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A); ∼45% of cells died. The dead cells exhibited the typical morphological features of apoptosis: round shape, condensed nuclei, very small size compared with healthy cells (Fig. 1B), and some membrane blebbing (Fig. 1C). Visualization of GFP-ATF6(1–360) in live cells indicated that the GFP tag did not impair ATF6(1–360) nuclear localization (Fig. 1C). When the full-length ATF6(1–656) was fused to GFP and transiently transfected into C2C12 cells, it also induced apoptosis in ∼40% of cells (data not shown). This may have been due to spontaneous processing of the full-length ATF6 to the mature form, as previously reported (19Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a dominant negative form of ATF6 (19Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), which contained the DNA binding domain but lacked the activation domain (ATF6 (158–360)), did not induce apoptosis (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the mature form of human ATF6 also induced apoptosis but not the dominant negative form (data not shown). ATF6 has been overexpressed in several other cell lines (e.g. COS (21Zhu C. Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)) without remarkable induction of apoptosis. This suggests that sensitivity to ATF6 overexpression is cell line dependent. Fig. 1D shows that GFP-ATF6(1–360) induced apoptosis in mammalian cells with different efficiencies. A mouse fibroblast cell line and a kidney cell line (NIH-3T3 and mIMCD-3, respectively) underwent apoptosis with 20–30% efficiency, but little apoptosis was induced in COS-1 (a monkey kidney cell line) and MCF-7 (a human breast cancer cell line) cells. These results indicated that resistance to active ATF6 varies among cell lines. To confirm that the observed apoptosis depended on the amount of active ATF6 in C2C12 cells, we examined GFP-ATF6(1–360) expression in separate lysates of dead and live cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A) showed that GFP-ATF6(1–360) expression in apoptotic cells was higher, on average, than in live cells, but the fusion protein appeared to be cleaved primarily by proteolysis during apoptosis. Caspases-12, -9, and -3 were specifically activated in the apoptotic cells (Fig. 2B) (15Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The expression of active ATF6 in live cells appeared to be insufficient to induce caspase activation or apoptosis. However, expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP), a representative of the proteins induced by ATF6, substantially increased in both live and dead cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2B). This result suggested that the small amount of GFP-ATF6(1–360) in live cells was sufficient to up-regulate BiP. Our previous study showed that active ATF6 was detectable in dying cells by Western blot, but active ATF6 was below the detection level in live cells treated with ER stressors or differentiation medium (4Nakanishi K. Sudo T. Morishima N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggested that relatively low levels of active ATF6 may mediate the UPR in self-defense, but higher levels of ATF6 may be required to mediate apoptosis. Apoptosis was induced by the expression of active GFP-ATF6(1–360) but not by the dominant negative GFP-ATF6(158–360) (Fig. 1A). In fact, apoptosis induced by active ATF6 was efficiently suppressed by overexpression of the dominant negative form tagged with DsRed (Fig. 3A). This might be explained by the efficient DNA binding of the ATF6 mutant, which lacked the transcription activation domain. This binding would competitively inhibit the binding of active ATF6 (19Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Nearly all the GFP-positive cells were also DsRed-positive; this indicated that both the active form and the dominant negative form of ATF6 were successfully co-expressed. Thus, the results were not due to competition between the CMV promoters within transfected cells (data not shown). These results suggested that apoptosis induction required transcription activated by ATF6. We reasoned that CHOP might mediate the proapoptotic function of ATF6 because the CHOP gene promoter contains a binding site for ATF6 (also sites for ATF4 and XBP1 (22Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar)), and CHOP induction was detected in C2C12 cells treated with ER stressors (4Nakanishi K. Sudo T. Morishima N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 16Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Tsuchiya K. Shibata T. Seiwa E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50375-50381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of GFP-CHOP in C2C12 cells did not induce significant apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, CHOP was not detected on Western blots of C2C12 cells transfected with GFP-ATF6(1–360) (data not shown). Therefore, CHOP expression is likely to be regulated by factor(s) other than ATF6 in C2C12 cells. These results suggested that the pro-apoptotic function of ATF6 was not dependent on CHOP. Therefore, ATF6-induced apoptosis must be dependent on another downstream factor(s) that is up-regulated by active ATF6. To identify genes that were up-regulated by ATF6, we performed a whole-genome microarray analysis of RNA samples prepared from C2C12 cells that had been electroporated with GFP-ATF6(1–360). Control cells were electroporated with the GFP vector alone. Fluorescence microscopy showed that the gene transfer efficiency was >90% for the GFP vector, but only ∼20% for GFP-ATF6(1–360) at 24 h post-electroporation. Approximately 50% of the cells transfected with GFP-ATF6(1–360) underwent apoptosis, which was consistent with the transfection assay (Fig. 1A). Live and dead cells were combined for the microarray analysis. To identify proapoptotic factors that function downstream of ATF6, we first selected genes that showed at least 1.5-fold higher expression in cells transfected with GFP-ATF6(1–360) compared with controls. After excluding genes with relatively low expression levels (<1% of the GAPDH expression level), we identified 44 up-regulated genes (supplemental Table 1). One was CHOP, and 12 others were reported previously to be UPR-related; thus, they participated in protein folding and/or vesicle transport. Of note, the CHOP expression level was only one-twentieth of the GAPDH and BiP expression levels. In addition, 24 of 44 up-regulated genes were related to phenomena apparently irrelevant to apoptosis. The remaining seven genes had not been evaluated previously for their involvement in apoptosis; thus, we analyzed them further. To examine whether these seven genes could induce apoptosis, the cDNAs were GFP-tagged and transfected into C2C12 cells. Among the seven candidates, only WBP1 induced apoptosis. WBP1 was originally identified in vitro as a protein that bound to the WW domain of Yes kinase-associated protein (23Chen H.I. Einbond A. Kwak S.J. Linn H. Koepf E. Peterson S. Kelly J.W. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17070-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), but its function had not been determined. The WW domain comprises 38 to 40 semiconserved amino acids, a motif shared by proteins of diverse functions, including structural, regulatory, and signaling proteins (24Ilsley J.L. Sudol M. Winder S.J. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis strongly suggested that WBP1 was a type I transmembrane protein with an N terminus that contained a putative signal sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, we fused WBP1 to a C-terminal GFP tag. Similar to GFP-ATF6(1–360), transfection of C2C12 cells with the GFP-tagged WBP1 cDNA caused apoptosis in ∼45% of transfected cells (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis showed that apoptosis was dependent on the level of WBP1 (Fig. 4B). We also found that, in apoptotic cells, caspases-12, -9, and -3 were processed for activation (Fig. 4C). Confocal microscopy of live cells showed that WBP1-GFP was localized primarily on the ER membrane. We detected co-localization of WBP1-GFP and Sar1 by immunofluorescence (Fig. 4D). The up-regulation of WBP1 by active ATF6 was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Under conditions where active ATF6 was expressed in ∼20% of"

https://openalex.org/W2083456767,"The scission of membranes necessary for vesicle biogenesis and cytokinesis is mediated by cytoplasmic proteins, which include members of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery. During the formation of intralumenal vesicles that bud into multivesicular endosomes, the ESCRT-II complex initiates polymerization of ESCRT-III subunits essential for membrane fission. However, mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal regulation of this process remain unclear. Here, we show that purified ESCRT-II binds to the ESCRT-III subunit Vps20 on chemically defined membranes in a curvature-dependent manner. Using a combination of liposome co-flotation assays, fluorescence-based liposome interaction studies, and high-resolution atomic force microscopy, we found that the interaction between ESCRT-II and Vps20 decreases the affinity of ESCRT-II for flat lipid bilayers. We additionally demonstrate that ESCRT-II and Vps20 nucleate flexible filaments of Vps32 that polymerize specifically along highly curved membranes as a single string of monomers. Strikingly, Vps32 filaments are shown to modulate membrane dynamics in vitro, a prerequisite for membrane scission events in cells. We propose that a curvature-dependent assembly pathway provides the spatial regulation of ESCRT-III to fuse juxtaposed bilayers of elevated curvature."
https://openalex.org/W1970101934,"Synthesis of a protective cyst wall is required for survival outside of the host and for infection of Giardia lamblia. Little is known of gene regulation of the cyst wall proteins (CWPs) during differentiation into dormant cysts. WRKY homologues constitute a large family of DNA-binding proteins in plants that are involved in several key cellular functions, including disease resistance, stress response, dormancy, and development. A putative wrky gene has been identified in the G. lamblia genome. We found that wrky expression levels increased significantly during encystation. The epitope-tagged WRKY was translocated into the nuclei during encystation. Recombinant WRKY specifically bound to its own promoter and the encystation-induced cwp1 and cwp2 promoters. WRKY contains several key residues for DNA binding, and mutation analysis revealed that its binding sequences are similar to those of the known plant WRKY proteins and that two of them are positive cis-acting elements of the wrky and cwp2 promoters. Overexpression of WRKY increased the cwp1-2 and myb2 mRNA levels, and these gene promoters were bound by WRKY in vivo. Interestingly, the wrky and cwp1-2 genes were up-regulated by ERK1 (extracellular signal-related kinase 1) overexpression, suggesting that WRKY may be a downstream component of the ERK1 pathway. In addition, a WRKY mutant that cannot enter nuclei and an ERK1 mutant lacking the predicted kinase domain showed decreased cwp1-2 gene expression. Our results suggest that the WRKY family has been conserved during evolution and that WRKY is an important transactivator of the cwp1-2 genes during G. lamblia differentiation into dormant cysts."
https://openalex.org/W2017024005,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the most common liver diseases. L-tryptophan and its metabolite serotonin are involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammation. However, it is unclear whether L-tryptophan promotes hepatic steatosis. To explore this issue, we examined the role of L-tryptophan in mouse hepatic steatosis by using a high fat and high fructose diet (HFHFD) model. L-tryptophan treatment in combination with an HFHFD exacerbated hepatic steatosis, expression of HNE-modified proteins, hydroxyproline content, and serum alanine aminotransaminase levels, whereas L-tryptophan alone did not result in these effects. We also found that L-tryptophan treatment increases serum serotonin levels. The introduction of adenoviral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, which stimulates the serotonin synthesis from L-tryptophan, aggravated hepatic steatosis induced by the HFHFD. The fatty acid-induced accumulation of lipid was further increased by serotonin treatment in cultured hepatocytes. These results suggest that L-tryptophan increases the sensitivity to hepatic steatosis through serotonin production. Furthermore, L-tryptophan treatment, adenoviral AADC introduction, and serotonin treatment induced phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and a potent mTOR inhibitor rapamycin attenuated hepatocyte lipid accumulation induced by fatty acid with serotonin. These results suggest the importance of mTOR activation for the exacerbation of hepatic steatosis. In conclusion, L-tryptophan exacerbates hepatic steatosis induced by HFHFD through serotonin-mediated activation of mTOR."

To gain further insight into the molecular mechanism of amelogenin nanosphere formation, we manipulated the interactions between amelogenin monomers by altering pH, temperature, and protein concentration to create isolated metastable amelogenin oligomers. Recombinant porcine amelogenins (rP172 and rP148) and three different mutants containing only a single tryptophan (Trp(161), Trp(45), and Trp(25)) were used. Dynamic light scattering and fluorescence studies demonstrated that oligomers were metastable and in constant equilibrium with monomers. Stable oligomers with an average hydrodynamic radius (R(H)) of 7.5 nm were observed at pH 5.5 between 4 and 10 mg · ml(-1). We did not find any evidence of a significant increase in folding upon self-association of the monomers into oligomers, indicating that they are disordered. Fluorescence experiments with single tryptophan amelogenins revealed that upon oligomerization the C terminus of amelogenin (around residue Trp(161)) is exposed at the surface of the oligomers, whereas the N-terminal region around Trp(25) and Trp(45) is involved in protein-protein interaction. The truncated rP148 formed similar but smaller oligomers, suggesting that the C terminus is not critical for amelogenin oligomerization. We propose a model for nanosphere formation via oligomers, and we predict that nanospheres will break up to form oligomers in mildly acidic environments via histidine protonation. We further suggest that oligomeric structures might be functional components during maturation of enamel apatite."
https://openalex.org/W2128224367,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules present cell internally derived peptides at the plasma membrane for surveillance by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The surface expression of most class I molecules at least partially depends on the endoplasmic reticulum protein, tapasin, which helps them to bind peptides of the right length and sequence. To determine what makes a class I molecule dependent on support by tapasin, we have conducted in silico molecular dynamics (MD) studies and laboratory experiments to assess the conformational state of tapasin-dependent and -independent class I molecules. We find that in the absence of peptide, the region around the F pocket of the peptide binding groove of the tapasin-dependent molecule HLA-B*44:02 is in a disordered conformational state and that it is converted to a conformationally stable state by tapasin. This novel chaperone function of tapasin has not been described previously. We demonstrate that the disordered state of class I is caused by the presence of two adjacent acidic residues in the bottom of the F pocket of class I, and we suggest that conformational disorder is a common feature of tapasin-dependent class I molecules, making them essentially unable to bind peptides on their own. MD simulations are a useful tool to predict such conformational disorder of class I molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1971505657,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract in ATXN1. A prominent site of pathology in SCA1 is cerebellar Purkinje neurons where mutant ATXN1 must enter the nucleus to cause disease. In SCA1, phosphorylation of ATXN1 at Ser-776 modulates disease. Interestingly, Ser-776 is located within a region of ATXN1 that harbors several functional motifs including binding sites for 14-3-3, and splicing factors RBM17 and U2AF65. The interaction of ATXN1 with these proteins is thought to be regulated by the phosphorylation status of Ser-776. In addition, Ser-776 is adjacent to the NLS in ATXN1. Although pS776-ATXN1 is enriched in nuclear extracts of cerebellar cells, the vast majority of 14-3-3 is in the cytoplasmic fraction. We found that dephosphorylation of cytoplasmic pS776-ATXN1 is blocked by virtue of it being in a complex with 14-3-3. In addition, data suggest that binding of 14-3-3 to cytoplasmic ATXN1 impeded its transport to the nucleus, suggesting that 14-3-3 must disassociate from ATXN1 for transport of ATXN1 to the nucleus. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that once in the nucleus pS776 is able to be dephosphorylated. Evidence is presented that PP2A is the pS776-ATXN1 phosphatase in the mammalian cerebellum. In the nucleus, we propose that dephosphorylation of pS776-ATXN1 by PP2A regulates the interaction of ATXN1 with the splicing factors RBM17 and U2AF65."
https://openalex.org/W1982041953,"The proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (complex I/NDH-1) is a multisubunit enzymatic complex. It has a characteristic l-shaped form with two domains, a hydrophilic peripheral domain and a hydrophobic membrane domain. The membrane domain contains three antiporter-like subunits (NuoL, NuoM, and NuoN, Escherichia coli naming) that are considered to be involved in the proton translocation. Deletion of either NuoL or NuoM resulted in an incomplete assembly of NDH-1 and a total loss of the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase activity. We have truncated the C terminus segments of NuoM and NuoL by introducing STOP codons at different locations using site-directed mutagenesis of chromosomal DNA. Our results suggest an important structural role for the C-terminal segments of both subunits. The data further advocate that the elimination of the last transmembrane helix (TM14) of NuoM and the TM16 (at least C-terminal seven residues) or together with the HL helix and the TM15 of the NuoL subunit lead to reduced stability of the membrane arm and therefore of the whole NDH-1 complex. A region of NuoL critical for stability of NDH-1 architecture has been discussed. The proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (complex I/NDH-1) is a multisubunit enzymatic complex.

The membrane domain contains three antiporter-like subunits (NuoL, NuoM, and NuoN, Escherichia coli naming) that are considered to be involved in the proton translocation. Deletion of either NuoL or NuoM resulted in an incomplete assembly of NDH-1 and a total loss of the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase activity. We have truncated the C terminus segments of NuoM and NuoL by introducing STOP codons at different locations using site-directed mutagenesis of chromosomal DNA. Our results suggest an important structural role for the C-terminal segments of both subunits. The data further advocate that the elimination of the last transmembrane helix (TM14) of NuoM and the TM16 (at least C-terminal seven residues) or together with the HL helix and the TM15 of the NuoL subunit lead to reduced stability of the membrane arm and therefore of the whole NDH-1 complex. A region of NuoL critical for stability of NDH-1 architecture has been discussed.

EC 1.6.5.3) is the first enzyme of the respiratory chain in most eukaryotic cells. Complex I catalyzes the electron transfer from NADH to quinone, which is linked to the translocation of four protons through the inner mitochondrial membrane. This enzymatic complex, made up of 45 different polypeptides, is one of the largest enzymes of the respiratory chain, with a molecular mass of ∼1000 kDa (1Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J.

The physiological importance of complex I is highlighted by the fact that this enzyme is the principal source of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria and that its deficiencies have been shown to be the origin of many human neurodegenerative diseases (3Lu J.

The membrane domain of NDH-1 is composed of seven subunits (named NuoA, NuoH, NuoJ, NuoK, NuoL, NuoM, and NuoN in Escherichia coli), which are all homologues of the mammalian mitochondrial encoded subunits ND3, ND1, ND6, ND4L, ND5, ND4, and ND2, respectively. Recently, Sazanov's group (7Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A. Nature. 2010; 465: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) reported the three-dimensional structural model of the transmembrane segment of E. coli NDH-1 at 3.9 Å resolution and of the whole structure of Thermus thermophilus at 4.5 Å. These structures confirmed the membrane distribution of the hydrophobic subunits that were previously outlined by biochemical methods (10Guénebaut V. Schlitt A. Weiss H. Leonard K. Friedrich T. J.

The NuoA, -K, and -J subunits form a bundle and are in contact with the hydrophilic domain subunits NuoCD and NuoB, possibly making a quinone binding pocket at the interface between the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic domain. The structure of the hydrophobic domain revealed a common topology for the NuoL, NuoN, and NuoM, wherein these subunits were composed of 12 continuous transmembrane (TM) helices and two discontinuous TM helices. The longer subunit NuoL, however, possesses two extra TM helices. One of the most interesting findings from this structure is that these two extra helices are connected by a long amphipathic α-helix (110 Å in case of E. coli), the HL helix, which is spanning from NuoL, through NuoM, to NuoN, making a bridge among these subunits (7Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A. Nature. 2010; 465: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The distal location of the antiporter-like subunits, NuoL, NuoM, and NuoN from the electron transfer pathway strongly suggested a long range conformational change as essential part of the energy-coupling mechanism of complex I/NDH-1 (indirect coupling) (8Yagi T.

Based on the three-dimensional structure, Sazanov and co-workers (7Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A. Nature. 2010; 465: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) have hypothesized that the HL helix of NuoL can work in a piston-like mechanism, driving the conformational changes along the antiporter-like subunits. In the present work, using E. coli NDH-1, we attempted to clarify the structural role of the C-terminal segments of NuoL and NuoM that are most distantly located from the peripheral domain. Primary sequence comparison of the NuoL extra stretch or the NuoM C-terminal region among diverse organisms indicated that amino acid residues are barely conserved in these regions. Therefore, conventional mutation approach (mutation of the conserved residues) does not seem to be useful. Therefore, we created truncation mutants by introducing stop codons directly on the nuoL and nuoM genes in the chromosomal NDH-1 operon by site-directed mutagenesis and investigated their effects on the architecture and enzymatic activities of NDH-1. Recently, study of the NuoL extra stretch has been published by Steimle et al. (28Steimle S. Bajzath C. Dörner K. Schulte M. Bothe V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 3386-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The results by Steimle et al. (28Steimle S. Bajzath C. Dörner K. Schulte M. Bothe V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 3386-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were significantly different from this work. Possible causable factors leading to these differences were also discussed. PCR product, DNA gel extraction, and plasmid purification kits were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The pGEM®-T Easy Vector System was from Promega (Madison, WI). The site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange® II XL kit) and the Herculase® Enhanced DNA polymerase were from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX). The pKO3 vector was a generous gift from Dr. George M. Church (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The endonucleases were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). p-Nitroblue tetrazolium was from EMD Biosciences (La Jolla, CA). All other chemicals including dNADH, NADH, and antibiotics were from Sigma-Aldrich. The antibodies against E. coli NDH-1 subunits NuoB, NuoCD, NuoE, NuoF, NuoG, NuoI, NuoK, NuoM, and NuoL were obtained previously in our laboratory (29Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Yano T. Yagi T. Ohnishi T. J.

E. coli MC4100 (F−, araD139, Δ(arg F-lac)U169, ptsF25, relA1, flb5301, rpsL 150.λ−) was used to generate nuoL and nuoM site-specific mutations. The NuoL knock-out (NuoL-KO) and the C terminus-truncated NuoL (ctNuoL) mutants were generated by employing the pKO3 system according to the method described by Link et al. (32Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) and Nakamaru-Ogiso et al. (25Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Kao M.C. Chen H. Sinha S.C. Yagi T. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 39070-39078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, an E. coli NuoL-KO was constructed by replacement of the nuoL gene in the NDH-1 operon by spectinomycin using the pKO3 system. In parallel, a DNA fragment that includes the nuoL gene together with a 1-kb upstream and 1-kb downstream DNA segments from E. coli DH5α was cloned in the pGEM®-T Easy Vector system, generating pGEM/nuoL. pGEM/nuoL was used as template to obtain the nuoL-STOP mutants and the nuoL-ΔV519-K581 mutant. The nuoL mutants were subcloned into the pKO3 vector generating the pKO3/nuoL(STOP mutants) or pKO3/nuoL(ΔV519-K581). The pKO3/nuoL(STOP mutants) and the pKO3/nuoL(ΔV519-K581) plasmids were used to replace the spectinomycin gene in E. coli nuoL-KO by recombination. The strategy used to obtain the NuoM knock-out (NuoM-KO) and the C terminus truncated NuoM (ctNuoM) mutants were the same as we reported previously in Torres-Bacete et al. (31Torres-Bacete J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36914-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli ctNuoL and ctNuoM mutants were grown and the inverted membrane vesicles were prepared according to the method described previously in our laboratory (31Torres-Bacete J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E.

Then, the cells were harvested and frozen at −80 °C. The cells were thawed and resuspended at 10% (w/v) in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 15% glycerol). The cell suspension was sonicated twice (15 s) and passed twice through a French press (15,000 psi). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (23,400 × g for 10 min). The supernatant was centrifuged again (256,600 × g for 30 min), and the membrane-rich pellet was resuspended in buffer A, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C before use. The content of the NDH-1 subunits were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against NuoB, NuoCD, NuoE, NuoF, NuoG, NuoI, NuoK, NuoL, and NuoM subunits. For the production of the NuoL and NuoM antibodies, we selected the peptides H357HEQNIFKMGGLRKS371 (the loop between TM11 and TM12 in NuoL) and F205NYEELLNTPMS216 (the loop between TM6 and TM7 in NuoM), respectively (25Nakamaru-Ogiso E.

Blue native PAGE was performed according to the method described previously (35Kao M.C. Di Bernardo S. Perego M. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32360-32366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The assembly of NDH-1 was examined by immunoblotting using anti-NuoL and NuoCD antibodies and NADH dehydrogenase activity staining (25Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Kao M.C. Chen H. Sinha S.C. Yagi T. Ohnishi T.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9545-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The measurements of the electron transfer activities by the NDH-1 ctNuoL and ctNuoM mutants were performed using dNADH as substrate. The enzymatic reactions were conducted at 30 °C in a SLM DW-2000 spectrophotometer according to the methods described previously (37Yagi T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In brief, the dNADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity was performed using 80 μg of protein/ml of membrane samples in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA containing 10 mm KCN, and 1 mm K3Fe(CN)6. The reaction was started by the addition of 150 μm dNADH. The absorbance change was monitored at 420 nm. The dNADH-DB reductase activity was conducted in a similar way using 50 μm DB as the electron acceptor instead of K3Fe(CN)6. The absorbance change was followed at 340 nm. The dNADH oxidase activity was performed under the same conditions except that neither KCN nor DB were added. Extinction coefficients of ϵ420 = 1.00 mm−1 cm−1 for K3Fe(CN)6 and ϵ340 = 6.22 mm−1 cm−1 for dNADH were used for the activity calculations. We observed that despite the complete absence of dNADH oxidase and dNADH-DB reductase activity the NuoL-KO and NuoM-KO mutants still showed residual (∼30%) dNADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity. It is known that dNADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity of NDH-1 needs at least NuoF (the NADH-binding subunit) and NuoE (38Yano T. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5907-5913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The NuoL-KO mutant lacks NuoF and NuoE in the membranes and the NuoM-KO mutant does not house NuoF. In addition, similar activity was observed in a NuoF knock-out mutant. This is most likely a diaphorase activity unrelated to NDH-1. Therefore, the values obtained for the NuoL-KO and NuoM-KO mutants were subtracted as a background activity from the activity values of the wild type and the different mutants analyzed. The generation of membrane potential for the ctNuoL and ctNuoM mutants was assayed using 0.33 mg of protein/ml of membrane vesicles in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.3), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 2 μm oxonol VI as described previously (33Kao M.C.

Biochem. 1997; 121: 746-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by addition of 0.2 mm dNADH, and the absorbance changes at 630–603 nm were recorded. The proton ionophore FCCP (2 μm) was added to uncouple the reaction. The NDH-1 proton pump activity was followed by ACMA fluorescence quenching (40Amarneh B. Vik S.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 50 μg of protein/ml of membrane vesicles was used for the assay, whereas 200 μm dNADH was used as substrate. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Any variations from the procedures and details are described in the figure legends. NuoL and NuoM are two of the most well conserved membrane subunits in NDH-1/complex I from bacteria to mammals (see supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). Both NuoL and NuoM subunits share a similar secondary structure (7Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A. Nature. 2010; 465: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), except that the longer NuoL subunit possesses two extra TM helices, TM15 and TM16, connected by a long amphipathic helix (HL). This TM15-HL-TM16 C-terminal region displays low sequence homology among the diverse organisms. As described in the Introduction, we investigated structural role of the extra stretch of ctNuoL and C-terminal region of NuoM by using truncated mutation technique. Fig. 1 shows the locations at which the stop codons were introduced. In the NuoL subunit, these positions are Gly488 (NuoL was truncated at the beginning of the ΤΜ15), Thr517 (truncation at the beginning of the HL helix), Trp593 (truncation toward the end of the HL helix), Ala607 (truncation in the middle of the ΤΜ16), Val611 (truncated three residues before the C terminus of NuoL) and Leu612 (truncated two residues before the C terminus; last residue of the ΤΜ16). We also constructed a NuoL mutant in which the complete HL helix was lacking, whereas the ΤΜ helices 15 and 16 were intact (ΔV519-K581, Fig. 1). In the NuoM subunit, the positions at which the stop codons were introduced are Asn502 and Asn495 (truncation in the middle of the periplasmic C-terminal segment at two different positions), Ile485 (in which the periplasmic C-terminal segment was eliminated), Met467 (in which TM14 was eliminated), and Gly459 (truncation in the middle of the cytoplasmic loop that connects TM13 and TM14). We studied the effect of the C terminus truncation mutants, ctNuoL and ctNuoM, on the subunit contents and architecture of NDH-1 by Western blotting and BN-PAGE. We used antibodies raised against the NuoL and NuoM subunits, and another seven NDH-1 subunits: the peripheral subunits NuoB, NuoCD, NuoE, NuoF, NuoG, NuoI, and the membrane subunit NuoK. The results are exhibited in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3. As expected, membrane vesicles from the NuoL knock-out (NuoL-KO) and NuoM knock-out (NuoM-KO) mutants totally lacked the NuoL and NuoM subunit, respectively. The contents of other NDH-1 subunits were also affected. NuoCD was detected in both deletion mutants, albeit at a lower level. However, other subunits examined were either significantly diminished (NuoL-KO) or not discernible (NuoM-KO). It is important to note that the NuoL-KO-rev and NuoM-KO-rev mutants showed similar protein levels for all the subunits analyzed when compared with the wild type. As shown in Fig. 2A, in the C terminus truncation mutants of NuoL (G488STOP, T517STOP, W593STOP, and A607STOP), the amount of NuoL was either greatly reduced or too low to detect. As expected, membranes of these mutants also showed reduced contents of other NDH-1 subunits. The result for the mutant ΔV519-K581 was similar to those of the aforementioned truncation mutants. In contrast, two truncation mutants V611STOP and L612STOP retained a normal level of NuoL together with the other subunits. All of the truncated NuoL mutants showed significant amounts of NuoM in the membranes. As shown in Fig. 3A, in the case of NuoM truncation mutants lacking the TM14 (G459STOP and M467STOP), neither NuoM nor NuoL was detectable. Interestingly, the other NDH-1 subunits analyzed for the above two mutants showed contents mostly comparable with the wild type. The rest of the ctNuoM mutants constructed displayed NDH-1 subunits content at a level similar to the wild type.FIGURE 3A, immunoblotting of membrane preparations from the ctNuoM mutants. Antibodies against the NuoM, NuoB, NuoCD, NuoE, NuoF, NuoG, NuoI, NuoK, and NuoL subunits were used. 15 μg of protein per lane was loaded on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel (for details, see Fig. 2A).

As shown in Fig. 2B, no NDH-1 assembly was detected in the membranes of the NuoL-KO mutant either by activity staining or by immunoblot using antibodies against the NuoCD subunit (data not shown). Here again, the revertant showed normal assembly of NDH-1 like the wild type. Among the ctNuoL mutants constructed, only the ctNuoL-V611STOP and -L612STOP mutants showed positive activity staining in the BN-PAGE comparable with the wild type. In agreement with the activity staining results, no NDH-1 assembly was detected by immunoblotting in the ctNuoL-G488STOP, -T517STOP, -W593STOP, -A607STOP, and -ΔV519-K581 mutants. The correct assembly of NDH-1 in the ctNuoM mutants was analyzed by BN-PAGE (Fig. 3B). As expected from the immunoblot experiments, no NDH-1 assembly was detected in the ctNuoM mutants in which the TM14 was truncated (ctNuoM-G459STOP and -M467STOP). E. coli contains the alternative NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (or NDH-2) in addition to NDH-1. Because NDH-1 can use dNADH as substrate, whereas NDH-2 cannot, all enzymatic assays were performed using dNADH as the substrate to eliminate contribution from NDH-2 (41Matsushita K. Ohnishi T. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7732-7737Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We measured the electron transfer activities of NDH-1 in membrane vesicles obtained from E. coli MC4100 wild type and the ctNuoL and ctNuoM mutants (Table 1). The electron transfer activities assayed were the dNADH-K3Fe(CN)6 oxidoreductase, dNADH oxidase, and dNADH-DB oxidoreductase of NDH-1.TABLE 1Enzymatic activities of the ctNuoL and ctNuoM mutants of E. coli NDH-1MutantdNADH-O2aPercentage of dNADH-O2 reductase activity (100% activity of WT was 0.61 μmol dNADH/mg protein/min).dNADH-DBbPercentage of dNADH-DB reductase activity (100% activity of WT was 0.69 μmol dNADH/mg protein/min).dNADH-K3Fe(CN)6cPercentage of dNADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity (100% activity of WT was 1.5 μmol K3Fe(CN)6/mg protein/min).%%%WT100 ± 6.0100 ± 8.0100 ± 4.7NuoL-KO-rev102 ± 2.786 ± 5.1100 ± 5.9NuoM-KO-rev113 ± 4.495 ± 14.0106 ± 6.1ctNuoL-G488STOP2 ± 0.92 ± 0.318 ± 2.3ctNuoL-T517STOP1 ± 1.02 ± 1.227 ± 3.5ctNuoL-W593STOP1 ± 0.43 ± 0.727 ± 2.9ctNuoL-A607STOP4 ± 1.92 ± 0.320 ± 1.9ctNuoL-V611STOP66 ± 6.767 ± 3.280 ± 5.8ctNuoL-L612STOP89 ± 11.073 ± 5.791 ± 3.5ctNuoL-ΔV519-K5811 ± 0.41 ± 2.030 ± 4.7ctNuoM-G459STOP9 ± 1.19 ± 0.633 ± 1.2ctNuoM-M467STOP2 ± 0.61 ± 0.333 ± 0.6ctNuoM-I485STOP64 ± 2.260 ± 3.867 ± 5.6ctNuoM-N495STOP77 ± 0.867 ± 6.875 ± 4.5ctNuoM-N502STOP81 ± 9.479 ± 2.375 ± 0.6a Percentage of dNADH-O2 reductase activity (100% activity of WT was 0.61 μmol dNADH/mg protein/min).b Percentage of dNADH-DB reductase activity (100% activity of WT was 0.69 μmol dNADH/mg protein/min).c Percentage of dNADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity (100% activity of WT was 1.5 μmol K3Fe(CN)6/mg protein/min).

This activity was significantly affected in the mutants where the assembly of the whole NDH-1 complex was compromised. As seen in Table 1, the ctNuoL-G488STOP, -T517STOP, and ΔV519-K581 mutants that lack the HL helix, showed only ∼20–30% of the dNADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity when compared with the wild type. Similar results were obtained in case of the mutants with the HL helix intact but in which TM16 was totally or partially eliminated ctNuoL-W593STOP and -A607STOP. The dNADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity was found to be similar to the wild type (80 and 91%, respectively) only when NuoL was truncated at the last two or three residues prior to the C terminus (ctNuoL-V611STOP and -L612STOP). These results highlight not only the importance of the HL helix in keeping the structure of the membrane arm but also the role of the ΤΜ16 for the correct anchorage of the intact structure. In accordance with the results of dNADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity, the ctNuoL mutants lacking the HL helix and/or the TM16 did not show energy-coupled NDH-1 activities (dNADH oxidase and dNADH-DB reductase) ("
https://openalex.org/W2108665679,"Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) cause several disorders referred to as laminopathies, which include premature aging syndromes, lipodystrophy, and striated muscle disorders. There is evidence that lamin A/C plays a role in gene expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs regulating mRNAs involved in various biological processes, including the pathophysiology of striated muscles. Here, we profiled the expression of the miRNA transcriptome in skeletal muscle from patients with LMNA-related muscular dystrophy. Results show that control and patient groups can be distinguished based on their miRNA expression profile. Sixteen miRNAs are significantly dysregulated in patients compared with controls. Pathway enrichment analysis in the predicted targets of these miRNAs revealed pathways involved in muscle repair, such as MAPK, transforming growth factor-β, and Wnt signaling. Interestingly, 9 of these miRNAs (hsa-miR-100, -127-3p, -148a, -136*, -192, -335, -376c, -489, and -502-3p) are highly expressed in fetal muscle, suggesting that the fetal miRNA gene program mediates a regenerative process. Overexpression of these miRNAs in C2C12 mouse myoblasts revealed that 3 of them (miR-100, -192, and -335) participate in muscle proliferation and differentiation. We identified target genes that likely mediate this effect, which include the calcineurin gene PPP3CA. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that miRNA expression is affected in laminopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2107608920,"The cellular repertoire of importin (IMP) proteins that mediates nuclear import of transcription factors and chromatin remodeling agents is critical to processes such as differentiation and transformation. This study identifies for the first time independent roles for specific IMPαs in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs), showing that mESC differentiation is accompanied by dynamic changes in the levels of transcripts encoding the IMPs, IMPα3, IMPα4, IMPβ1, and IPO5. Of these, only IMPα4 was maintained at higher levels in differentiating mESCs, correlating with the finding that IMPα4 overexpression induced a significant decrease in Oct3/4 protein levels compared to control transfections. In parallel, IMPα4 protein showed a unique and striking shift in subcellular localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during differentiation, which is consistent with activation of a role in nuclear import of differentiation factors. Overexpression of a dominant-negative IMPα2 isoform, when assessed against adjacent untransfected or IMPα2 transfected cells, led to both a significant reduction in endogenous Oct3/4 protein levels and inhibition of Oct3/4 nuclear localization, suggesting that IMPα2-mediated delivery of Oct3/4 to the nucleus contributes directly to maintenance of mESC pluripotency. These findings implicate IMPα2 and IMPα4 in specific but distinct roles in the fate choice between pluripotency and commitment to differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1914304108,"Activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is involved in HIV-1-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In the present study, we hypothesize that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α or PPARγ can protect against HIV-1-induced MMP-9 overexpression in brain endothelial cells (hCMEC cell line) by attenuating cellular oxidative stress and down-regulation of caveolae-associated redox signaling. Exposure to HIV-1-infected monocytes induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt in hCMEC by 2.5- and 3.6-fold, respectively; however, these effects were attenuated by overexpression of PPARα or PPARγ and by silencing of caveolin-1 (cav-1). Coculture of hCMEC with HIV-1-infected monocytes significantly induced MMP-9 promoter and enzyme activity by 3- to 3.5-fold. Promoter mutation studies indicated that SP-1 (g1940t_g1941t) is an essential transcription factor involved in induction of MMP-9 promoter by HIV-1. In addition, HIV-1-stimulated activity of MMP-9 promoter was inhibited by mutation of AP-1 site 2 (c1918t_a1919g) and both (but not individual) NF-κB binding sites (g1389c and g1664c). PPAR overexpression, ERK1/2 or Akt inhibition, and silencing of cav-1 all effectively protected against HIV-1-induced MMP-9 promoter activity, indicating a close relationship among HIV-1-induced cerebrovascular toxicity, redox-regulated mechanisms, and functional caveolae. Such a link was further confirmed in MMP-9-deficient mice exposed to PPARα or PPARγ agonist and injected with the HIV-1-specific protein Tat into cerebral vasculature. Overall, our results indicate that ERK1/2, Akt, and cav-1 are involved in the regulatory mechanisms of PPAR-mediated protection against HIV-1-induced MMP-9 expression in brain endothelial cells.—Huang, W., András, I.

These FnBP IDRs consist of Fn-binding repeats (FnBRs) that form a highly extended tandem β-zipper interaction on binding to the N-terminal domain of Fn. Several FnBR residues are highly conserved across bacterial species, and here we investigate their contribution to the interaction. Mutation of these residues to alanine in SfbI-5 (a disordered FnBR from the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes) reduced binding, but for each residue the change in free energy of binding was <2 kcal/mol. The structure of an SfbI-5 peptide in complex with the second and third F1 modules from Fn confirms that the conserved FnBR residues play equivalent functional roles across bacterial species. Thus, in SfbI-5, the binding energy for the tandem β-zipper interaction with Fn is distributed across the interface rather than concentrated in a small number of “hot spot” residues that are frequently observed in the interactions of folded proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2103497290,"Interactions between polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and tumor cells have been reported to facilitate the adhesion and subsequent extravasation of tumor cells through the endothelium under blood flow, both of which are mediated by binding β(2)-integrin to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Here the adhesions between human WM9 metastatic melanoma cells, PMNs, and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) were quantified by a gas-driven micropipette aspiration technique (GDMAT). Our data indicated that the cellular binding affinity of PMN-WM9 pair was 3.9-fold higher than that of the PMN-HPMEC pair. However, the effective binding affinities per molecular pair were comparable between the two cell pairs no matter whether WM9 cells or HPMECs were quiescent or cytokine-activated, indicating that the stronger adhesion between PMN-WM9 pair is mainly attributed to the high expression of ICAM-1 on WM9 cells. These results proposed an alternative mechanism, where WM9 melanoma cells adhere first with PMNs near vessel-wall regions and then bind to endothelial cells via PMNs under blood flow. In contrast, the adhesions between human MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast carcinoma cells and PMNs showed a comparable cellular binding affinity to PMN-HPMEC pair because the ICAM-1 expressions on MDA-MB-231 cells and HPMECs are similar. Furthermore, differences were observed in the intrinsic forward and reverse rates of the β(2)-integrin-ICAM-1 bond between PMN-TC and PMN-EC pairs. This GDMAT assay enables us to quantify the binding kinetics of cell adhesion molecules physiologically expressed on nucleated cells. The findings also further the understanding of leukocyte-facilitated tumor cell adhesion from the viewpoint of molecular binding kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W2079996771,"Trehalose synthase (TreS) catalyzes the reversible interconversion of maltose and trehalose and has been shown recently to function primarily in the mobilization of trehalose as a glycogen precursor. Consequently, the mechanism of this intriguing isomerase is of both academic and potential pharmacological interest. TreS catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of α-aryl glucosides as well as α-glucosyl fluoride, thereby allowing facile, continuous assays. Reaction of TreS with 5-fluoroglycosyl fluorides results in the trapping of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate consistent with TreS being a member of the retaining glycoside hydrolase family 13 enzyme family, thus likely following a two-step, double displacement mechanism. This trapped intermediate was subjected to protease digestion followed by LC-MS/MS analysis, and Asp(230) was thereby identified as the catalytic nucleophile. The isomerization reaction was shown to be an intramolecular process by demonstration of the inability of TreS to incorporate isotope-labeled exogenous glucose into maltose or trehalose consistent with previous studies on other TreS enzymes. The absence of a secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effect and the general independence of k(cat) upon leaving group ability both point to a rate-determining conformational change, likely the opening and closing of the enzyme active site."

Replacement of the tryptophans of apoA-I with phenylalanines (ΔW-apoA-I) leads to unusually large and stable self-associated species. We took advantage of this unique solution property of ΔW-apoA-I to analyze the role of self-association in determining the structure and lipid-binding properties of apoA-I as well as ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1)-mediated cellular lipid release, a relevant pathway in atherosclerosis. Monomeric ΔW-apoA-I and wild-type apoA-I activated ABCA1-mediated cellular lipid release with similar efficiencies, whereas the efficiency of high order self-associated species was reduced to less than 50%. Analysis of specific self-associated subclasses revealed that different factors influence the rate of HDL formation in vitro and ABCA1-mediated lipid release efficiency. The α-helix-forming ability of apoA-I is the main determinant of in vitro lipid solubilization rates, whereas loss of cellular lipid release efficiency is mainly caused by reduced structural flexibility by formation of stable quaternary interactions.

However, the actual distribution of apoA-I self-associated species in solution is not known, and their presence has been reported even at 0.1 mg/ml (40Silva R.A. Hilliard G.M. Fang J. Macha S. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2759-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In humans, the plasma concentration of apoA-I is ∼1 mg/ml, where ∼90–95% is HDL-associated and ∼5–10% lipid-free/lipid-poor apoA-I (41Rye K.A. Barter P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 42Nanjee M.N. Brinton E.A. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 207-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Based on this rough estimation, the general notion is that plasma concentration of lipid-free apoA-I is lower than 0.1 mg/ml. Furthermore, binding of as few as two lipid molecules is sufficient to disrupt apoA-I self-association in favor of monomeric lipid-poor species (39Sparks D.L. Frank P.G. Braschi S. Neville T.A. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1727-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 43Zhao Y. Sparks D.L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25145-25151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, based on a probable lipid-free apoA-I concentration below 0.1 mg/ml and the abundance of lipids, monomers have been hypothesized to be the predominant form of lipid-free apoA-I in plasma. However, the true physiological self-association state of lipid-free apoA-I in the subendothelial artery space, wherein apoA-I exerts its main antiatherogenic function, remains elusive. Importantly, increasing evidence suggest that dysfunctional apoA-Is, either by natural mutations (44Weers P.M. Patel A.B. Wan L.C. Guigard E. Kay C.M. Hafiane A. McPherson R. Marcel Y.L. Kiss R.S. J.

Griffin M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1977-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), correspond to an altered self-association state that may contribute to the mechanism underlying protein malfunctioning. Recently, the heterozygous apoA-I S36A mutation has been linked to severe reduction in plasma pre-β-HDL levels and a modified self-association state of the lipid-free protein, which has been proposed to contribute to the inability of the protein variant to produce a normal HDL phenotype (44Weers P.M.

ApoA-I Nichinan, a C-terminal single amino acid deletion variant (ΔE235) that associates with low plasma HDL levels and abnormal distribution of HDL subspecies, is another case of potentially self-association-dependent alteration of apoA-I functionality. In fact, the higher than wild-type self-association levels of apoA-I Nichinan may play a role in the lower lipid-binding and ABCA1-mediated cholesterol release efficiencies, leading to the dysfunctional HDL phenotype of Nichinan variant carriers (45Kono M. Tanaka T. Tanaka M. Vedhachalam C. Chetty P.S. Nguyen D. Dhanasekaran P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Saito H. J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, altering the apoA-I self-association state may impair lipid-free apoA-I stability in solution and lead to functional consequences. Recently, a mechanistic link between apoA-I self-association and amyloidosis has been identified (46Wong Y.Q. Binger K.J. Howlett G.J. Griffin M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1977-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the atherosclerotic plaque tissue, deposition of apoA-I amyloids contributes to the mechanism of atherosclerosis progression (47Mucchiano G.I. Häggqvist B. Sletten K. Westermark P. J. Pathol. 2001; 193: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 48Teoh C.L. Griffin M.D. Howlett G.J. Protein Cell. 2011; 2: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ApoA-I methionine oxidation (49Sigalov A.B. Stern L.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2001; 113: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) has been implicated in the formation of full-length apoA-I amyloid fibrils through a mechanism involving disruption of apoA-I self-association, reduction of conformational stability in solution, and higher propensity to protein misfolding and aggregation (46Wong Y.Q. Binger K.J. Howlett G.J. Griffin M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 1977-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The above cases suggest that increased or stabilized self-association can be a negative determinant of apoA-I lipid binding efficiency, whereas reduced native self-association may affect the stability of apoA-I structure in solution. The two opposite alterations both have dysfunctional consequences, and it can be hypothesized that maintenance of the native self-association state of lipid-free apoA-I is essential to preserving different aspects of apoA-I functionality. Here we compared the structural and functional properties of wild-type apoA-I (WT-apoA-I) and a Trp to Phe variant (ΔW-apoA-I) with enhanced propensity to self-association. Characterization of ΔW-apoA-I structure-function showed that modifications of specific apoA-I residues can cause global structural rearrangements that propagate to the quaternary structure level with striking functional consequences. Interestingly, ΔW-apoA-I retains wild-type-like lipid-binding and ABCA1-mediated cellular lipid release efficiencies when monomeric or in its low self-association state but displays severely reduced activity when in a high self-association state. These results demonstrate for the first time the effect of self-association on the efficiency of apoA-I as a cellular lipid recipient. Furthermore, structure-function data for specific ΔW-apoA-I self-associated subclasses permit novel conclusions about the structural requirements underlying ABCA1-mediated cellular lipid release. Primer-directed PCR mutagenesis was used to introduce single amino acid mutations within human apoA-I cDNA as described previously (50Oda M.N. Bielicki J.K. Berger T. Forte T.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1710-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Multiple Trp to Phe mutations were generated one by one using the mutated DNA as template for the following primer-directed PCRs. DNA sequences were confirmed by automated sequencing and subcloned into the pET-20b bacterial expression vector (Novagen). ApoA-I proteins were expressed in BL21 E. coli (Invitrogen) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described previously (51Ryan R.O. Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 27: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Protein masses were verified by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (29,798 and 29,642 Da for WT- and ΔW-apoA-I, respectively). Further details about the protein sequence are reported in the supplemental material. Stock solutions of WT- and ΔW-apoA-I were prepared as follows. In WT[High] and ΔW[High], WT- and ΔW-apoA-I, respectively, were refolded at high concentration (∼3.0 mg/ml) by dialysis versus sodium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.4) (PB) just after affinity column purification. WT[Low] and ΔW[Low] were derived from “High” samples by overnight incubation at 37 °C in the presence of 3 m guanidine HCl (GdnHCl) as denaturant (52Chetty P.S. Mayne L. Lund-Katz S. Stranz D. Englander S.W. Phillips M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The denatured samples were refolded at ∼0.1 mg/ml by dialysis versus PB with three buffer changes. All stock solutions were stored at 4 °C. The concentration of each preparation of “High” and “Low” stock solutions was determined by amino acid analysis with an accuracy of ±2% (Molecular Structure Facility at Genome Center, University of California, Davis, CA) and confirmed by the BCA assay (Pierce). After storage at 4 °C and prior to each experiment, concentration of the stock solutions and protein integrity were checked by BCA and SDS-PAGE, respectively. Protein stock solutions were prepared in alternative buffer systems: Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 8.2 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and sodium phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 20 mm phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). No differences in protein stabilities and self-association properties were detected in these buffers. NovexTM 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) were loaded with 3 μg of protein/lane and run to termination at 1,500 V-h under non-denaturing conditions in Tris-glycine buffer (250 mm Tris base, 2.5 m glycine, pH 8.35). Staining by GelCode Blue (Pierce) and imaging were performed as described previously (53Cavigiolio G. Shao B. Geier E.G. Ren G. Heinecke J.W. Oda M.N. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4770-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Protein analysis and isolation of self-associated species were performed on a Superdex 200 prep grade XK 16/100 column and/or a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) controlled by an AKTA UPC 10 FPLC system (GE Healthcare). Elution by PB was performed at flow rates of 1.5 and 0.5 ml/min for Superdex 200 and Superose 6 columns, respectively. Initial estimation of the identity of individual self-associated species was performed by chemical cross-linking by bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) and SDS-PAGE analysis, as described previously (40Silva R.A. Hilliard G.M. Fang J. Macha S. Davidson W.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2759-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 54Gianazza E. Calabresi L. Santi O. Sirtori C.R. Franceschini G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7898-7905Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). An increase in the molecular weight of cross-linked species was observed upon cross-linking of higher order self-association species (data not shown). However, interpretation of chemical cross-linking results, specifically for lipid-free apolipoproteins, is not straightforward, because the amount and nature of cross-linked species depend on reagent concentrations and reaction conditions (stoichiometry, temperature, and incubation time). At high cross-linker/protein ratios, inter-oligomer cross-linking may produce apparent high molecular weight species that are not present in the native mixture (55Pyle L.E. Sawyer W.H. Fujiwara Y. Mitchell A. Fidge N.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12046-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At low cross-linker/protein ratios, non-exhaustive cross-linking may not bind all of the protein units present in the higher molecular weight species. These two possibilities cannot be completely ruled out in any experimental conditions; thus, chemical cross-linking is a weak technique for secure identification of self-associated species of lipid-free apolipoproteins. To identify the self-associated species, we rather relied on the following three independent techniques: SEC, using both Superose 6 and Superdex 200 columns; NDGGE with native protein standards; and dynamic light scattering. In SEC experiments, the apparent mass of protein samples was determined by comparing their distribution coefficients (Kav) with those of globular proteins of known mass as described in the supplemental material. Wherever applicable, dynamic light scattering (see supplemental material) was used to confirm the molecular weight of the self-associated species. CD data were recorded using AVIV 400 or AVIV 62DS spectropolarimeters with thermoelectric temperature control. Unless mentioned otherwise, far-UV CD spectra (185–250 nm), and melting data were recorded from 20 μg/ml protein solutions in PB. The CD data were normalized to protein concentrations and reported as molar residue ellipticity, [ϴ]. Protein α-helical content was estimated from the molar residue ellipticity at 222 nm ([ϴ]222) using the equation, % α-helix = ((−[ϴ]222 + 3000)/36,000) × 100 (56Gursky O. Atkinson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 2991-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In melting experiments, CD data [ϴ]222 (T) were recorded upon sample heating from 5 to 98 °C at a constant rate of 80 K/h. The reversibility of thermal unfolding was checked by cooling the protein to 5 °C and repeating the temperature scan for the same sample at the same scan rate. Excess heat capacity, Cp(T), was measured using a VP-DSC Microcal differential scanning microcalorimeter (Northampton, MA). WT[High] and ΔW[High] stock solutions where diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in PB and rapidly degassed just before DSC analysis. Data were recorded during sample heating from 5 to 98 °C at a rate of 90 °C/h, corrected for buffer base line, and normalized to protein concentration. No protein precipitation was visually observed after temperature scanning. However, to test for potential protein loss by precipitation from solution, post-DSC samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and protein concentration was measured by BCA analysis. Sample protein concentrations before and after DSC were within the experimental error, suggesting that exposure of proteins to high temperature did not lead to any significant protein loss from solution. ApoA-I-induced clearance of multilamellar vesicles (MLV) of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) was monitored at 25 °C by turbidity using a Varian Cary-300 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with thermoelectric temperature control. DMPC-MLV were produced as described (57Lagerstedt J.O. Budamagunta M.S. Oda M.N. Voss J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9143-9149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The DMPC-MLV suspension (1 ml) was placed in a 1-cm path length quartz cell and equilibrated at 25 °C for 5–10 min, during which the turbidity was recorded at 325 nm with an averaging time of 5 s as described (45Kono M. Tanaka T. Tanaka M. Vedhachalam C. Chetty P.S. Nguyen D. Dhanasekaran P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Saito H. J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 809-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). No significant changes in turbidity were detected during equilibration. The clearance experiment was initiated by briefly stopping the data recording and adding a small volume of the stock protein solution to final lipid and protein concentrations of 80 and 20 μg/ml, respectively. The sample was mixed gently, and the turbidity measurements were immediately resumed and continued for 1 h. DMPC-HDL particles were reconstituted by incubating ΔW[High], ΔW[High]60, and ΔW[High]90C with DMPC-MLV (1:4, w/w) overnight at 25 °C. After incubation, the samples were span down to pellet any unbound lipid (not soluble at the incubation condition used), and total lipid and protein contents were quantified in the supernatant by Bartlett and BCA assays, respectively. The final protein:lipid content was similar (∼1:100 molar ratio) for all reconstituted HDL samples, irrespective of the self-associated state of apoA-I. Furthermore, lipid-free monomeric apoA-I was not detected in the samples by NDGGE and SEC analysis after 24 h of incubation (data not shown). Taken together, these observations suggest that the amount of lipidated protein was similar in the three samples. DMPC-particles were analyzed by phosphotungstate negative staining EM under low dose conditions in a CM12 transmission electron microscope (Philips Electron Optics) as described (58Mehta R. Gantz D.L. Gursky O. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 200–250 particles/micrograph were assigned to five different diameter classes (7.2, 9.6, 12.0, 14.4, and >14.4 nm) by determining their diameters with an accuracy of ±1.2 nm. Distinct self-association ΔW-apoA-I subclasses were prepared either by thermal treatment of ΔW[High] (tetramers and monomers) or isolation from ΔW[High] by SEC (hexadecamers and octamers) as described in the supplemental material. HEK293 cells stably expressing human ABCA1-EGFP fusion protein (293/2c) (59Abe-Dohmae S. Ikeda Y. Matsuo M. Hayashi M. Okuhira K. Ueda K. Yokoyama S. J. Biol.

Cells were subcultured in a 6-well tray in 10% FCS-DF medium at 1.2 × 106 cells/well. After 48-h incubation, the cells were washed with buffer H (Hanks' balanced salt solution, containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) and 14 mm glucose), and incubated with 1 ml/well DF medium containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and apoA-I as indicated, with or without 300 μm dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Because 300 μm dibutyryl cyclic AMP significantly enhances apoA-I-mediated lipid release without affecting dose dependence (data not shown) (59Abe-Dohmae S. Ikeda Y. Matsuo M. Hayashi M. Okuhira K.

By doing so, it plays a major role in the regulation of gene expression by controlling the overall rate of mRNA translation as well as the selection of mRNAs for translation. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 causes it to release eIF4E to function in mRNA translation. 4E-BP1 is also subject to covalent addition of N-acetylglucosamine to Ser or Thr residues (O-GlcNAcylation) as well as to truncation. In the truncated form, it is both resistant to phosphorylation and able to bind eIF4E with high affinity. In the present study, Ins2Akita/+ diabetic mice were used to test the hypothesis that hyperglycemia and elevated flux of glucose through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway lead to increased O-GlcNAcylation and truncation of 4E-BP1 and consequently decreased eIF4E function in the liver. The amounts of both full-length and truncated 4E-BP1 bound to eIF4E were significantly elevated in the liver of diabetic as compared with non-diabetic mice. In addition, O-GlcNAcylation of both the full-length and truncated proteins was elevated by 2.5- and 5-fold, respectively. Phlorizin treatment of diabetic mice lowered blood glucose concentrations and reduced the expression and O-GlcNAcylation of 4E-BP1. Additionally, when livers were perfused in the absence of insulin, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in the livers of diabetic mice was normalized to the control value, yet O-GlcNAcylation and the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E remained elevated in the liver of diabetic mice.

These findings provide insight into the pathogenesis of metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes. The best characterized mechanism for regulating the mRNA binding step in translation initiation involves the reversible binding of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 to the mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E. Binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E blocks its association with eIF4G and disrupts assembly of the cap-binding complex, eIF4F (1Ptushkina M. von der Haar T. Karim M.M. Hughes J.M. McCarthy J.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As a result, a shift from cap-dependent to cap-independent translation occurs, leading to an altered pattern of selection of mRNAs to be translated (2von der Haar T. Gross J.D. Wagner G. McCarthy J.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E is reversible and is controlled by the sequential phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues, several of which are regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin in complex 1 (mTORC1) 2The abbreviations used are: mTORC1mammalian target of rapamycin in complex 1GFATglutamine-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferasePUGNAcO-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidenamino)N-phenylcarbamateWCLwhole cell lysate. signaling pathway (3Gingras A.C.

Hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 binds to eIF4E strongly; however, upon phosphorylation the interaction of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E is dramatically reduced. mammalian target of rapamycin in complex 1 glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidenamino)N-phenylcarbamate whole cell lysate. It has long been established that diabetes is associated with increased binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E (4Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Fadden P. Haystead T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C705-C709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In part, the increased binding to eIF4E is due to a reduction in phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 resulting from diminished mTORC1 signaling in response to the deficiency of insulin. Another mechanism that could account for the diabetes-induced increase in the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E is the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to serine or threonine residues (O-GlcNAcylation) at or near some specific phosphorylation site(s) (5Zeidan Q. Hart G.W. J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Protein O-GlcNAcylation is driven by the flux of glucose through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which converts the sugar to UDP N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), the donor substrate for the addition of O-GlcNAc to serine and threonine residues (6Buse M.G. Robinson K.A. Marshall B.A. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E241-E250Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). UDP-GlcNAc synthesis is regulated by the enzyme glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), which catalyzes the first and rate-determining step in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. This reaction involves the irreversible transfer of the amino group from glutamine and the isomerization of fructose-6-phosphate to produce glucosamine-6-phosphate. The reversible addition of O-GlcNAc to proteins is catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase, whereas O-GlcNAcase catalyzes removal in a dynamic relationship that is reminiscent of protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (7Yang X.

In fact, O-GlcNAcylation often is found on or near phosphorylation sites, and there is ample evidence for extensive crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation in controlling biological processes (10Wells L.

Although only 2–5% of intracellular glucose enters the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway under normal conditions (15McClain D.A. Lubas W.A. Cooksey R.C. Hazel M. Parker G.J. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10695-10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), both hyperglycemia and diabetes have been shown to elevate flux through the pathway and increase the production UDP-GlcNAc (16Liu K. Paterson A.J. Chin E. Kudlow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2820-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Additionally, increased O-GlcNAcylation has been linked to the complications of diabetes (17Buse M.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E1-E8Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Another mechanism that impairs 4E-BP1 phosphorylation is p53-mediated truncation, which rapidly leads to dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1, sequestration of eIF4E into an inactive 4E-BP1·eIF4E complex, and decreased assembly of the eIF4F complex (18Constantinou C.

Activation of p53 induces a specific N-terminal cleavage of 4E-BP1, which results in an isoform that is ∼3 kDa smaller than the full-length protein (20Constantinou C. Clemens M.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4839-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, O-GlcNAcylation of p53 at Ser149 stabilizes p53 and blocks ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (21Yang W.H.

Thus elevated flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway may not only inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by promoting O-GlcNAcylation but may also enhance p53 activity, resulting in increased levels of the phosphorylation resistant truncated 4E-BP1. In the present study, Ins2Akita/+ mice were used as a model of type 1 diabetes to evaluate the hypothesis that in the liver of diabetic mice elevated flux of glucose through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway leads to increased O-GlcNAcylation and concomitant reduced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 resulting in increased association with eIF4E. Ins2Akita/+, a C57BL/6 mutant mouse, spontaneously develops diabetes with significant early loss of pancreatic β-cell mass as a result of a single missense mutation (C96Y) in the insulin 2 gene (22Yoshinaga T.

As a result, misfolded proinsulin accumulates and promotes endoplasmic reticulum stress in β-cells that leads to apoptosis through induction of the ER stress-associated apoptosis factor Chop (24Oyadomari S.

We report that 4E-BP1 is O-GlcNAcylated in both liver and H4IIE cells in culture. Our results explore the regulation of 4E-BP1 in the liver of diabetic mice and provide evidence for a model wherein hyperglycemia-driven 4E-BP1 O-GlcNAcylation could inhibit cap-dependent mRNA translation and protein synthesis. Protease inhibitor mixture was purchased from Sigma and ECL Western blotting detection reagent was purchased from Pierce. Anti-phospho-S6K1(Thr389), goat anti-mouse, and goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories. Anti-O-GlcNAc antibody was purchased from Covance, anti-GAPDH antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and all other antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Preparation of the 4E-BP1 and eIF4E antibodies has been described previously (25Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol.

Male Ins2Akita/+ mice and Ins2+/+ littermates (C57BL/6 background) were bred in the Diabetic Complications Animal Models Core using procedures approved by The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Diabetic phenotype and genotype were confirmed 4.5 weeks after birth by blood glucose concentrations >250 mg/dl (One-Touch Lifescan meter; Lifescan, Inc., Milpitas, CA) via tail puncture. To determine the effects of normalizing glucose levels in Ins2Akita/+ mice, phlorizin (0.4 g/kg in 10% EtOH, 15% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 75% saline) was administered subcutaneously twice daily for 7 days. Ins2Akita/+ mice and Ins2+/+ littermates were maintained on a 12:12 h light:dark cycle, with food and water provided ad libitum. Livers were perfused in situ with a nonrecirculating medium for 30 min at a flow rate of 4 ml/min, as described previously (27Kimball S.R. Siegfried B.A. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54103-54109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. In an attempt to match physiological glucose concentrations, the perfusate contained either 33 or 11 mm glucose for Ins2Akita/+ or Ins2+/+ mice, respectively. Where indicated, O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidenamino)N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc) (1.4 mm in PBS with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide) was infused directly into the inflow line at a rate of 0.2 ml/min to produce a final calculated concentration of 40 μm. The perfusate also contained amino acids at the concentrations present in the arterial plasma of a fasted rat (28Flaim K.E. Liao W.S. Peavy D.E. Taylor J.M. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2939-2946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the analysis of protein phosphorylation state, a portion (∼0.3 g) of liver was homogenized in 7 volumes of homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 200 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 μl/ml Sigma protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4) using a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (29Dennis M.D. Baum J.I. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8287-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of S6K1, 4E-BP1, and mTOR was measured in the supernatants using phospho-specific antibodies as described previously (29Dennis M.D. Baum J.I. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 8287-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Livers were homogenized in 7 volumes of λ-phosphatase buffer (30Sun H. Lu C.H. Shi H. Gao L. Yao S.Q. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1485-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) containing 10 μl/ml Sigma protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min. Fifty μl of supernatant were combined with 10 μl λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C, and the sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating 1000 × g supernatants of liver homogenates with monoclonal anti-eIF4E or anti-4E-BP1 antibody. Homogenate containing ∼1 mg of protein was incubated with 4 μg antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Then, 500 μg BioMag goat anti-mouse IgG beads (Qiagen), previously blocked with low salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4) containing 1% BSA, was added to each sample with 175 μl of PBS and 12.5 μl of Triton X-100, and the suspension was rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed twice with 1 ml of cold low salt buffer, once with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.04% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4), resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer, and then boiled for 5 min. Supernatants were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies to 4E-BP1, eIF4E, and O-GlcNAc, and the results were normalized for the amount of eIF4E in the immunoprecipitate. RNA was isolated from livers, following a standard TRIzol protocol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using an ABI High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). For quantitation of mRNA, quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a QuantiTech SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) and the following primers for GFAT: 5′-TGGCGTGGCCAGTACAAA-3′ and 5′-GGAGATCCTGTCATCACACATCA-3′. The data are expressed as mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance and Student's t test were used to compare differences among groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. SDS-PAGE of liver supernatants resolved full-length 4E-BP1 into multiple isoforms based upon phosphorylation state in addition to a protein that was ∼3 kDa smaller (Fig. 1A, top). Western blot analysis for O-GlcNAcylated proteins revealed a signal at 15–20 kDa that was reminiscent of the banding pattern of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 1A, bottom). When liver supernatants were treated with λ-phosphatase, the phospho-isoforms of full-length 4E-BP1 collapsed into a single band at ∼18 kDa. In the presence of λ-phosphatase, a similar shift was seen with the O-GlcNAcylation bands, suggesting that the protein recognized by the antibody was 4E-BP1. Further evidence supporting such a conclusion is provided by the results shown in Fig. 1B in which 4E-BP1 was immunoprecipitated from liver supernatants using a monoclonal anti-4E-BP1 antibody. As seen in the figure, O-GlcNAc-modified 4E-BP1 was specifically detected in immunoprecipitates of liver supernatants. Detection of O-GlcNAc on both the upper and lower isoforms of 4E-BP1 suggests that the protein may be phosphorylated and O-GlcNAcylated simultaneously. In addition, O-GlcNAcylation of the truncated protein (tr4E-BP1) suggests that the modification is not restricted to the N-terminal portion of the protein. In the present study, the Ins2Akita/+ mouse was selected as a model of type 1 diabetes. Compared with non-diabetic Ins2+/+ littermates, the relative phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in the liver of diabetic mice was reduced to 66% of the non-diabetic value (Fig. 1C). In addition to reduced phosphorylation, O-GlycNAcylation of 4E-BP1 was increased by 29% (Fig. 1D). It is well established that 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated on multiple residues by mTORC1 (3Gingras A.C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). To more clearly evaluate mTORC1 signaling, the phosphorylation of two additional targets of the kinase was measured. In diabetic mice, phosphorylation of S6K1 on Thr389 and eIF4G on Ser1108 were both significantly reduced (Fig. 1, E and F), suggesting that mTORC1 signaling was repressed in the liver of diabetic compared with non-diabetic mice. The association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E was evaluated by immunoprecipitating eIF4E from liver supernatants and measuring the amount of 4E-BP1 present in the immunoprecipitate by Western blot analysis. The amounts of both full-length 4E-BP1 (Fig. 2A) and tr4E-BP1 (Fig. 2B) bound to eIF4E were elevated by >2-fold in the liver of diabetic Ins2Akita/+ mice when compared with non-diabetic mice. The expression of eIF4E in the liver of diabetic and non-diabetic mice was not different (Fig. 2C); however, the enhanced association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 is potentially influenced by a 24% elevation in the expression of 4E-BP1 in the liver of diabetic mice (Fig. 2D). Because the expression of 4E-BP1 in the liver of diabetic mice is only modestly elevated compared with non-diabetic mice, yet the amount of 4E-BP1 bound to eIF4E is increased by >2-fold, it is likely that other factors, such as changes in phosphorylation or O-GlcNAcylation, play an important role in influencing the interaction of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E. Indeed, O-GlcNAcylation of full-length and truncated 4E-BP1 in the eIF4E immunoprecipitate was elevated 2.5- and 5-fold, respectively (Fig. 2, E and F). A similar effect on the modification of 4E-BP1 was observed when streptozotocin was used to chemically induce diabetes in Dilute Brown Non-Agouti mice (supplemental Fig. S1). The liver of streptozotocin treated mice exhibited increased O-GlcNAcylation of 4E-BP1 and increased association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). Notably, O-GlcNAcylation of 4E-BP1 bound to eIF4E was increased by >3-fold compared with control mice (supplemental Fig. S1, E and F). These findings confirm that increased O-GlcNAcylation of 4E-BP1 occurs in other models of diabetes. Together, these findings suggest that the changes in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation that occur with diabetes may differentially affect the function of the protein. The role of hyperglycemia in mediating the diabetes-induced alterations in 4E-BP1 was assessed using phlorizin to reduce plasma glucose concentrations. Previous studies have shown that phlorizin treatment rapidly lowers plasma glucose concentrations in diabetic animals by producing renal glycosuria and blocking intestinal glucose absorption through inhibition of sodium-glucose symporters (e.g. Ref. 31Hong E.G. Jung D.Y. Ko H.J. Zhang Z. Ma Z. Jun J.Y. Kim J.H. Sumner A.D. Vary T.C. Gardner T.W. Bronson S.K. Kim J.K. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 293: E1687-E1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Ins2Akita/+ mice have elevated concentrations of blood glucose compared with non-diabetic mice (32Barber A.J. Antonetti D.A. Kern T.S. Reiter C.E. Soans R.S. Krady J.K. Levison S.W. Gardner T.W. Bronson S.K. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In the present study, 11-week-old Ins2Akita/+ mice and Ins2+/+ littermates were injected twice daily for 7 days with phlorizin or vehicle alone. Phlorizin reduced the plasma glucose of diabetic mice from a concentration in excess of 600 mg/dl (upper level of detection) to 310 ± 30 mg/dl over the 7-day treatment period (supplemental Fig. S2). Total hepatic 4E-BP1 expression was modestly increased in diabetic animals, and upon treatment with phlorizin, the amount of 4E-BP1 in livers of diabetic animals returned to near control values (Fig. 3A). Hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1 favors its polyubiquitination and degradation (33Elia A. Constantinou C. Clemens M.J. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); thus, these changes likely reflect alterations in phosphorylation of the protein. Notably, phlorizin treatment restored phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in the liver of diabetic mice to a value not significantly different than non-diabetic mice (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the increase in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was simply due to restoration of mTORC1 signaling, the effect of phlorizin treatment on phosphorylation of S6K1 and eIF4G was evaluated. Unlike 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, phlorizin treatment of diabetic mice did not result in a significant increase the phosphorylation of either S6K1 on Thr389 (Fig. 3C) or eIF4G on Ser1108 (Fig. 3D). This finding suggests that the restoration of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by phlorizin was not due to increased mTORC1 signaling, but instead may be the result of removing a competing modification such as O-GlcNAc that inhibits 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at one or more specific sites. In fact, O-GlcNAcylation of 4E-BP1 was reduced when diabetic mice were treated with phlorizin (Fig. 4A), such that the extent of 4E-BP1 O-GlcNAcylation was positively correlated with blood glucose concentration following 7 days of treatment (supplemental Fig. S3).FIGURE 4Phlorizin treatment of diabetic mice inhibits hepatic O-GlcNAcylation of 4E-BP1 and reduces the amount of 4E-BP1 bound to eIF4E. Ins2Akita/+ diabetic mice and non-diabetic littermates were treated with phlorizin (PHZ) or solvent only twice daily for 7 days. A, 4E-BP1 content was assessed by treating supernatants from liver WCL with λ-phosphatase (PPase) followed by Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E was examined by immunoprecipitating (IP) eIF4E from liver supernatants and measuring the amount of 4E-BP1 in the immunoprecipitate by Western blot analysis and normalizing the results to the amount of eIF4E in the immunoprecipitate. O-GlcNAcylation of full-length 4E-BP1 (C) and truncated 4E-BP1 (tr4E-BP1; D) bound to eIF4E was also measured by Western blot analysis. E, total eIF4E, 4E-BP1, and 4E-BP1 O-GlcNAcylation was assessed in WCL by Western blot analysis. Representative blots are shown. Values are means + S.E. (n = 10). Statistical significance is denoted by the presence of different letters above the bars on the graphs. Bars with different letters are statistically different, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further evaluate the possibility that reducing O-GlcNAcylation may improve phosphorylation of a specific site(s), 4E-BP1 was analyzed with phosphospecific antibodies. Interestingly, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr70 was increased when diabetic mice were treated with phlorizin, whereas there was no change in phosphorylation at either Thr36/47 or Ser65 (supplemental Fig. S4, A–C). Additionally, when O-GlcNAcylated 4E-BP1 was immunoprecipitated from liver supernatants, it was observed to have reduced phosphorylation at Thr70 compared with total liver supernatant (supplemental Fig. S4D). Together, these findings suggest that O-GlcNAcylation of 4EBP1 inhibits phosphorylation at Thr70. One potential residue that could be O-GlcNAcylated to inhibit Thr70 phosphorylation is Thr81, which in silico O-GlcNAcylation site prediction scores as the most likely target of modification (supplemental Fig. S4E). When Thr81 was mutated to alanine, O-GlcNAcylation of the variant protein in HEK293T cells was reduced by 62% compared with wild-type 4E-BP1 (supplemental Fig. S4E). Interestingly, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at Thr81 has been previously identified by large scale phosphoproteomic analysis (34Cantin G.T. Yi W. Lu B. Park S.K. Xu T. Lee J.D. Yates 3rd., J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 1346-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the increase in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, it was anticipated that phlorizin treatment of diabetic mice would also reduce the interaction of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E. Immunoprecipitation of eIF4E from liver supernatants revealed this to be the case, as phlorizin treatment reduced the amount of 4E-BP1 in immunoprecipitates from the liver of Ins2Akita/+ diabetic compared with non-diabetic littermates (Fig. 4B). Analysis of 4E-BP1 in the eIF4E immunoprecipitate also revealed a reduction in the O-GlcNAcylation of 4E-BP1 bound to eIF4E following phlorizin treatment of diabetic mice. Indeed, the O-GlcNAcylation of full-length 4E-BP1 bound to eIF4E in the liver of diabetic mice following treatment with phlorizin was not significantly different than non-diabetic values (Fig. 4C), whereas O-GlcNAcylation on tr4E-BP1 was reduced from 9-fold to just 2.5-fold above non-diabetic values (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that 4E-BP1 O-GlcNAcylation may limit the amount of eIF4E available for eIF4F assembly. A number of studies have shown that flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway increases during diabetes and in response to hyperglycemic conditions, leading to enhanced O-GlcNAcylation of proteins (15McClain D.A. Lubas W.A. Cooksey R.C. Hazel M. Parker G.J. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10695-10699Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 35Marshall S. Bacote V.

High plasma glucose concentrations provide additional substrate for both glycolysis and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; however, because hyperglycemia inhibits glycolysis through GAPDH (37Du X. Matsumura T. Edelstein D. Rossetti L. Zsengellér Z. Szabó C. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and up-regulates the expression and activity of GFAT, the rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (38Yki-Järvinen H. Daniels M.C. Virkamäki A. Mäkimattila S. DeFronzo R.A. McClain D. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 302-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the net result is a substantial increase in UDP-GlcNAc production. In support of this possibility, in H4IIE rat liver heptoma cells incubated in medium containing 25 mm glucose, both the amount of 4E-BP1 associated with eIF4E and its O-GlcNAcylation were elevated compared with cells maintained in medium containing 5 mm glucose (supplemental Fig. S5A). To determine whether increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway could be responsible for alterations in 4E-BP1 O-GlcNAcylation, we measured the expression of GFAT in the liver of diabetic and non-diabetic mice and determined the effe"

Coactivator binding is strongly interdependent, as loss of one factor sharply reduces recruitment of other factors. The Rpd3(L) histone deacetylase is recruited to HO at two distinct times during the cell cycle, first by Ash1 to the URS1 region of the promoter and then by SBF/Whi5/Stb1 to URS2. SBF itself is localized to only a subset of its potential binding sites in URS2, and this localization takes longer and is less robust than at other SBF target genes, suggesting that binding to the HO promoter is limited by chromatin structures that dynamically change as the cell cycle progresses. Ash1 only binds at the URS1 region of the promoter, but an ash1 mutation results in markedly increased binding of SBF and Rpd3(L) at URS2, some 450 bp distant from the site of Ash1 binding, suggesting these two regions of the promoter interact. An ash1 mutation also results in increased coactivator recruitment, Swi/Snf and Mediator localization in the absence of the normally required Gcn5 histone acetyltransferase, and HO expression even in the presence of a taf1 mutation affecting TFIID activity that otherwise blocks HO transcription. Ash1 therefore appears to play a central role in generating the strongly repressive environment at the HO promoter, which limits the binding of several coactivators at URS2 and TATA region.

Chromatin is generally repressive, blocking access of factors to DNA and preventing gene transcription. Many chromatin factors can promote transcriptional activation by changing the post-translational modification status of nucleosomes, altering the positioning of nucleosomes, or by evicting nucleosomes from the DNA (1Cairns B.R. Nature. 2009; 461: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 2Weake V.M. Workman J.L. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 426-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The promoter of the yeast HO gene is under extremely tight transcriptional repression (3Takahata S. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HO encodes an endonuclease that initiates mating type switching by causing a double strand break at the MAT locus, and inappropriate expression of an endonuclease could be toxic. Three distinct coactivator complexes, Swi/Snf, SAGA, and Mediator, are each required for activation of HO transcription. Genetic studies have identified an array of other important factors that regulate HO, including the Sin3/Rpd3 histone acetylase (4Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1992; 68: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 5Stillman D.J. Dorland S. Yu Y. Genetics. 1994; 136: 781-788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to most yeast genes that have small compact promoters, regulatory elements at HO extend to −1900 bp from the transcription start site, and the next upstream open reading frame is at −3084 bp. The promoter has been divided into two regions, URS1 from −1900 to −1000 and URS2 from −900 to −200 (Fig. 1) (6Nasmyth K. Cell. 1985; 42: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). HO is cell cycle-regulated, and HO activation is complex, involving the sequential localization of DNA-binding factors and transcriptional coactivators (3Takahata S. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol.

The Swi5 DNA-binding protein acts first, entering the nucleus as cells pass anaphase in mitosis then binding to two sites at −1816 and −1305 within URS1. Swi5 recruits three transcriptional coactivators, Swi/Snf, SAGA, and Mediator, and Swi5 is then rapidly degraded, leading to rapid loss of Swi5 and coactivator localization at the HO promoter. Subsequently, the SBF activator, composed of the Swi4 and Swi6 subunits, binds to the URS2 region and recruits the Swi/Snf, SAGA, and Mediator coactivators to this promoter region. The later events are dependent on the earlier ones, but it is not known whether the coactivators recruited to URS2 are the same complexes recruited to URS1. Sequential changes in chromatin structure occur during the cell cycle at the HO promoter, well before transcription occurs (3Takahata S. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Initially, nucleosomes are positioned at the promoter, with the two Swi5-binding sites at −1816 and −1305 in nucleosome-free regions. Similar to some other promoters, nucleosome eviction from the HO promoter begins before transcriptional activation (9Adkins M.W. Howar S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol.

The situation at HO is unusually complex as it involves ordered waves of eviction. Nucleosomes are lost first from URS1, and this event requires Swi5 and Swi/Snf. Later in the cell cycle, nucleosomes are evicted from the left end of URS2, and this requires the earlier events at URS1 and also the FACT complex, which is recruited by SBF. Next, nucleosome loss occurs at the right end of URS2, requiring the Asf1 H3/H4 histone chaperone as well as the earlier events. Finally nucleosomes are lost at the TATA region coincident with binding of RNA polymerase II and transcriptional activation. This dependent series of events reveals the presence of several distinct chromatin structures at this promoter and their importance in maintaining strict repression of HO expression. The ASH1 gene was identified as a negative regulator of HO expression (13Sil A. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1996; 84: 711-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 14Bobola N. Jansen R.P. Shin T.H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1996; 84: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Budding yeast divides asymmetrically, producing larger mother cells and smaller daughter cells at mitotic division. HO has the unusual property of being expressed only in mother cells. The Ash1 protein is responsible for this asymmetry, with Ash1 protein accumulating primarily in daughter cells (15Cosma M.P. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 953-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Ash1 has been identified as a component of the Rpd3(L) complex (16Carrozza M.J. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S. Yates J. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1731: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which is one of two complexes containing the Rpd3 histone deacetylase, Rpd3(L) and Rpd3(S). Rpd3(L) functions primarily at promoters, whereas Rpd3(S) is recruited to methylated histone H3-K36 marked by the elongating RNA polymerase II complex and functions at open reading frames to repress cryptic transcription (17Carrozza M.J. Li B. Florens L. Suganuma T. Swanson S.K. Lee K.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S. Yates J. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L.

Cell. 2005; 123: 593-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Ash1 shows similarity to the GATA family of DNA-binding proteins and has been suggested to target Rpd3(L) to some promoters (16Carrozza M.J. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S. Yates J. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1731: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In addition to repressing HO expression, Ash1 is required for efficient activation of the FLO11 gene required for pseudohyphal growth (20Chandarlapaty S. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2884-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Pan X. Heitman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8364-8372Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and may regulate CLN3 expression in daughter cells (22Di Talia S. Wang H. Skotheim J.M. Rosebrock A.P. Futcher B. Cross F.R. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000221Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ash1 is therefore another regulator of HO transcription that acts by altering the structure of chromatin, in this case by assisting the recruitment of the Rpd3(L) histone deacetylase complex. Although the majority of Ash1 accumulates in daughter cells, the protein is also present in mother cells (13Sil A. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1996; 84: 711-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and we have shown that the regulatory properties of the HO gene in mother cells is markedly affected by the Ash1 present in mothers. In this study, we describe new complexities at the HO promoter. The recruitment of each coactivator to HO is dependent on the action of other coactivators, and thus coactivator binding is strongly interdependent. We show that the Rpd3(L) histone deacetylase is sequentially recruited to two different promoter regions during the cell cycle. Ash1 recruits Rpd3(L) only transiently to a site in URS1, but an ash1 mutation allows long lasting consequences on factor binding at distant promoter sites, suggesting that Ash1 generates repressive chromatin that persists long after Ash1 is degraded. The repressive nature of this promoter, combined with a requirement for interdependent coactivator recruitment at sequentially acting promoter elements, provides a mechanism for preventing unintentional expression of this endonuclease. All yeast strains used are listed in supplemental Table S1 and are isogenic in the W303 background (23Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Standard genetic methods were used for strain construction (24Rothstein R.

The ho(ΔURS2[−929 to −172]) mutant strain was constructed by transforming DY5401, which has URA3 inserted into the HO promoter at −1496 to −1222, with NsiI-PstI digested plasmid C539 (6Nasmyth K. Cell. 1985; 42: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Kim Nasmyth, and selecting on 5-fluoroorotic acid. The HO(−1166-m) mutation was generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis, converting the sequence “AATCGCGTAAAA” to “AATATT,” and using 5-fluoroorotic acid selection to insert this sequence into the promoter of strain DY7874, which has URA3 inserted into the HO promoter at −1496 to −1222, as well as a KanMX marker inserted downstream of the 3′UTR. Promoter mutations were verified by direct sequencing. Plasmids used are listed in supplemental Table S2. Details of plasmid construction are available upon request. Cell cycle synchronization was performed by galactose withdrawal and re-addition with a GALp::CDC20 strain grown at 25 °C in YEP medium containing 2% galactose and 2% raffinose (26Bhoite L.T. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2457-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A high degree of synchrony was demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis, budding indices, and analysis of cell cycle regulated mRNAs (data not shown). In other experiments, cells were grown in YEPD medium at 30 °C (25Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), unless otherwise noted. Cells containing the YCp-KanMX(HA-CDC28) plasmid were grown in media supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml G418. Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIPs) were performed as described previously (26Bhoite L.T.

ChIP assays were analyzed by real time PCR as described previously (28Eriksson P. Biswas D. Yu Y. Stewart J.M. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6419-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). PCR primers are listed in supplemental Table S3. Each ChIP sample was first normalized to an input DNA sample and then to the ChIP signal for a control region on chromosome I. Error bars in ChIP assays reflect the standard deviation of three replicate PCRs. For cell synchrony experiments, the ChIP values were normalized so that the zero time point was 1.0. For each epitope-tagged strain used for ChIP analysis during logarithmic growth, a genetically identical untagged strain was used as control. RT-qPCR 3The abbreviations used are: qPCRquantitative PCRTAFTATA-binding protein-associated factor. was used to measure mRNA levels as described previously (27Voth W.P. Yu Y. Takahata S.

Error bars in RT-qPCR assays reflect the standard deviation of three replicate PCRs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using in vitro translated Swi4 and recombinant Swi6 as described previously (29Sidorova J. Breeden L. Genetics. 1999; 151: 45-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Swi4 and Swi6 were expressed from plasmids pBD972 and pBD400, respectively, kindly provided by Linda Breeden. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (30Biswas D. Takahata S. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4445-4458Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) using anti-HA antibody, and blots were probed with anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies and scanned using a Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences). quantitative PCR TATA-binding protein-associated factor. The SBF factor (Swi4–Swi6) is required for expression of the HO gene. We therefore used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to measure Swi4-Myc binding to the HO promoter. Cells were synchronized by GALp::CDC20 arrest and release, which typically results in HO expression at 40 min after the release (3Takahata S. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). PCR primers tiled across the HO promoter were used to measure SBF binding at 0, 20, and 35 min following release (Fig. 1A). At 20 min, SBF binds to the URS1 region at approximately −1200 from the ATG, although at 35 min binding is seen at URS2. There are several surprises in these observations. First, SBF binds to URS1, although there are no recognizable SBF-binding sites in this region. Second, although SBF sites are distributed throughout URS2 (see map in Fig. 1A), strong binding at 35 min is only seen near the SBF sites in the left half of URS2. Although each SBF-binding site in URS2 has the same CACGAAAA sequence, it is possible that surrounding DNA sequences play an important role in determining binding affinity. To test this idea, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to examine in vitro binding of SBF to sites at the left (−857), middle (−461), and right (−246) parts of URS2. The EMSA signals in this assay are dependent on the presence of the recombinant Swi4 and Swi6 proteins (29Sidorova J. Breeden L. Genetics. 1999; 151: 45-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This experiment shows SBF has similar affinity for the three sites in vitro (Fig. 1B), despite the ChIP results showing strong SBF binding in vivo to the −857 region and very little binding to the −246 region (Fig. 1A). This differential binding of SBF to the sites along URS2 may be due to the nucleosome eviction at the left end of URS2 that occurs before the chromatin changes occur at the right end (3Takahata S. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, time course ChIP experiments examining three regions of URS2 show that SBF binding at −729 is somewhat reduced compared with −890, and binding to the right end of URS2 (−349) is both weak and slow (Fig. 1C). This gradient of SBF binding across URS2 is consistent with the changes in chromatin structure that sweep across HO URS2 during the cell cycle (3Takahata S. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), revealing the importance of chromatin structure in regulating SBF binding. To explain SBF binding at URS1, we looked for potential SBF-binding sites within this region. Although there is no sequence that matches the original CACGAAAA consensus (31Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1987; 48: 389-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), the sequence CGCGTAAAA present at −1166 in URS1 (supplemental Fig. S1A) is a reasonable match to the CgCGAAA consensus derived by both biochemical and informatics approaches (32Badis G. Chan E.T. van Bakel H. Pena-Castillo L. Tillo D. Tsui K. Carlson C.D. Gossett A.J. Hasinoff M.J. Warren C.L. Gebbia M. Talukder S. Yang A. Mnaimneh S. Terterov D. Coburn D. Li Yeo A. Yeo Z.X. Clarke N.D. Lieb J.D. Ansari A.Z. Nislow C. Hughes T.R. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 878-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Consistent with our results, Taba et al. (33Taba M.R. Muroff I. Lydall D. Tebb G. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2000-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) detected SBF binding to a 482-bp RsaI fragment from −1352 to −870. We have mutated this potential site at −1166, and SBF does not bind to URS1 in vivo in a strain with this mutation (supplemental Fig. S1B), whereas SBF binding to URS2 (supplemental Fig. S1C) and CLN2 (supplemental Fig. S1D) are largely unaffected in this same strain. HO expression levels are normal in this HO(−1166-mut) mutant, so reduced binding of SBF to URS1 does not lead to diminished transcription from this promoter (supplemental Fig. S1E). We next investigated the effect of deleting the URS2 region of HO. We constructed strains lacking the URS2 region (−929 to −172 from the ATG) in the chromosomal HO gene. ChIP experiments show equivalent Swi4 binding to URS1 at native HO and the modified HO(ΔURS2) gene (supplemental Fig. S1F), demonstrating that URS2 is not needed for SBF binding to the site at −1166. We next measured expression of this HO(ΔURS2) gene in wild type and swi6 mutant cells. The HO(ΔURS2) gene is expressed at normal levels in both cases, and thus Swi6 is not required for expression of HO(ΔURS2) (supplemental Fig. S1G), as reported previously (31Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1987; 48: 389-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). These experiments show that although SBF binding does occur at URS1, it is not required for HO activation, and SBF binding at URS2 is needed to overcome the inhibitory effect of URS2. The Swi5 DNA-binding protein binds to HO URS1 in late M/early G1 and recruits three coactivator complexes, Swi/Snf, SAGA, and Mediator, to this far upstream region of the promoter (3Takahata S. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Govind et al. (34Govind C.K. Yoon S. Qiu H. Govind S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5626-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) showed that the Gcn4 activator simultaneously recruits Swi/Snf, SAGA, and Mediator to the ARG1 promoter and that mutation of one coactivator sharply reduces recruitment of the other coactivators. We therefore examined the situation for Swi5 and found that the coactivators are largely dependent on one another for stable binding to HO URS1 (Fig. 2A). A swi5 gene disruption eliminates binding of all three coactivators, consistent with recruitment by the Swi5 DNA-binding protein (3Takahata S. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A swi2(E834K) mutation affecting Swi/Snf reduces binding of both SAGA and Mediator, disruption of the GCN5 subunit of SAGA reduces binding of both Swi/Snf and Mediator, and disruption of the GAL11 subunit of Mediator reduces binding of both Swi/Snf and SAGA. (We previously showed that a gcn5 mutation reduces Swi/Snf binding (35Mitra D. Parnell E.J. Landon J.W. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4095-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).) Thus, in addition to Swi5 being required to recruit the coactivators, any single coactivator mutation reduces binding of the other coactivators. We conclude that binding of these coactivators is interdependent at the HO promoter. We considered the possibility that coactivators are needed to facilitate Swi5 binding to a chromatin template. By this model, Swi5 interacts with coactivators as it attempts to bind to HO, and the coactivators assist Swi5 in binding. To test this idea, we examined the ability of Swi5 to bind in strains with coactivator mutations, but we found that Swi5 displayed no defect in binding either to HO URS1 or to another Swi5-dependent gene, PIR1, in coactivator mutant strains (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, Swi5 is able to bind without assistance from coactivators. An ash1 mutation can suppress transcriptional defects at HO, allowing expression despite loss of Swi2 or Gcn5 coactivator functions (35Mitra D. Parnell E.J. Landon J.W. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4095-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effects of an ash1 mutation on coactivator binding. By comparing the wild type and ash1 mutants, we saw a marked increase in Swi/Snf and Mediator binding to HO URS1 in the ash1 mutants (Fig. 2A, compare dark and light gray bars). This increased binding could be due, at least in part, to loss of Ash1 repression of HO expression in daughter cells (15Cosma M.P. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 953-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We next examined whether ash1 can suppress the defects in coactivator binding caused by other coactivator mutants. Although a gcn5 mutation reduces binding of both Swi/Snf and Mediator to HO URS1, Swi/Snf and Mediator do bind to HO in the gcn5 ash1 double mutant, and thus ash1 suppresses the gcn5 defect (Fig. 2A, compare dark and light gray bars). In contrast, ash1 does not suppress the defects in coactivator binding caused by swi2 or gal11 mutations. Finally, an ash1 mutation cannot suppress a swi5 disruption eliminating the DNA-binding protein that recruits the coactivators. Gcn5 is a histone acetyltransferase and Ash1 recruits the Rpd3(L) histone deacetylase to HO URS1 (described below), and these results are consistent with histone acetylation playing a role in facilitating binding of Swi/Snf and Mediator to HO URS1. We conclude that Ash1 inhibits Swi/Snf and Mediator binding to HO, binding that is stimulated by Gcn5-dependent histone acetylation. We also examined coactivator binding to the URS2 region of the HO promoter in various mutants (Fig. 2B). Disruption of the SWI5 gene encoding the DNA-binding protein that recognizes sites in URS1 eliminates coactivator binding to URS2, as do mutations in other coactivators. This is expected, as these mutations eliminate coactivator recruitment to URS1, and events at URS1 are a prerequisite for factor recruitment to URS2 (3Takahata S. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An ash1 mutation results in increased Swi/Snf and Mediator binding to URS2 and also suppresses the defects in Swi/Snf and Mediator binding at URS2 caused by a gcn5 mutation. This suggests that increased coactivator recruitment at URS1 also results in increased coactivator binding at URS2. Mutations in subunits of the Rpd3(L) complex allow HO transcription in the absence of normally required activators (5Stillman D.J. Dorland S. Yu Y. Genetics. 1994; 136: 781-788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Dorland S. Deegenaars M.L. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 2000; 154: 573-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, mass spectroscopic analysis of purified Rpd3(L) complex identified peptides corresponding to Ash1 (16Carrozza M.J. Florens L. Swanson S.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S. Yates J. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1731: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we performed ChIP assays with synchronized Ash1-Myc and Sds3-Myc strains to examine binding of Ash1 and Rpd3(L) to the HO promoter. Sds3 is a subunit of Rpd3(L) but is absent from the Rpd3(S) complex (17Carrozza M.J. Li B. Florens L. Suganuma T. Swanson S.K. Lee K.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S. Yates J. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L. Cell. 2005; 123: 581-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Ash1 and Rpd3(L) bind to HO URS1 with similar kinetics during the cell cycle (Fig. 3A). Rpd3(L) is recruited to the CLN1 and CLN2 genes (37Takahata S. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3378-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but Ash1 does not bind to these promoters (supplemental Fig. S3A) or to HO URS2 (Fig. 3A). To identify where Ash1 and Rpd3(L) bind at HO, we performed ChIP assays using log phase cells and analyzed binding using PCR primers throughout the HO promoter (Fig. 3B). Binding for each protein is centered at approximately −1200 in URS1. Binding of Rpd3(L) at the −1000 to −900 region is stronger than Ash1 binding, and we therefore examined Rpd3(L) ChIP in synchronized cells. Rpd3(L) binding to URS1 can be seen at 25 min following release, whereas binding at −900 in URS2 is only modest until 30 min (Fig. 3C). Additionally, this Rpd3(L) binding at −900 corresponds to the left half of URS2 where SBF binds (Fig. 1A), consistent with SBF recruiting Rpd3(L) to promoters (see below). Importantly, Rpd3(L) binds to HO URS1 slightly earlier in the cell cycle than to URS2 (compare Figs. 3E and 4A, wild type).FIGURE 4ash1 mutation results in increased SBF and Rpd3L binding. A, strains DY12247 (GALp::CDC20 SDS3-Myc) and DY12251 (GALp::CDC20 SDS3-Myc ash1) were synchronized, and ChIP samples were taken at various times following release from CDC20 arrest. Rpd3(L) binding to HO URS2 was measured with primers that amplify from −825 to −489. Sds3 is a subunit specific to Rpd3(L). B, strains DY12794 (GALp::CDC20 SWI4-Myc) and DY12795 (GALp::CDC20 SWI4-Myc ash1) were synchronized, and ChIP samples were taken at 35 min following release from CDC20 arrest, when cells are in late G1. SBF binding was analyzed with 15 sets of PCR primers across the HO promoter. C, strains DY12794 (GALp::CDC20 SWI4-Myc) and DY12795 (GALp::CDC20 SWI4-Myc ash1) were synchronized, and ChIP samples were taken at 20 min following release from CDC20 arrest, when cells are in early G1. SBF binding was analyzed with 15 sets of PCR primers across the HO promoter. URS1-, URS2-, Swi5-, and SBF-binding sites are shown for the HO promoter, where the ATG represents +1 and the transcription start site is at −20.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"

The primase and helicase activities of gene 4 protein (gp4) reside in the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of the polypeptide, respectively (3Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 39-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). T7 DNA primase derives several benefits from its physical association with the helicase, an association that, in other replication systems, requires an association of the separately encoded proteins (2Hamdan S.M. Richardson C.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 205-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 3Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 2009; 284: 23842-23851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The helicase domain of gp4 places it within the SF4 family of helicases (5Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Like other members of this family, gp4 assembles onto ssDNA as a hexamer, an oligomerization that is facilitated by the binding of dTTP (6Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 7Kim D.E. Narayan M. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). On ssDNA, the protein then translocates unidirectionally 5′ to 3′ by using the energy of hydrolysis of dTTP (8Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Upon encountering duplex DNA, gp4 will unwind the DNA. single-stranded DNA double-stranded DNA gene 5 polymerase/thioredoxin 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. The crystal structure of the hexameric gp4 reveals a 6-fold symmetric ring with a central core of 25–30 Å (Fig. 1A) (9Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy and biochemical studies provide strong evidence that ssDNA threads through the central core of the helicase, and it has been proposed that ssDNA transfers from one subunit to the adjacent subunit sequentially as dTTP is hydrolyzed in the intersubunit interfaces (6Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 9Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B.

Cell. 2006; 21: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also provided information on the mechanism by which the energy of hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate is coupled to the unidirectional translocation of the gene 4 helicase and unwinding of duplex DNA (10Crampton D.J. Mukherjee S. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Liao J.C. Jeong Y.J. Kim D.E. Patel S.S. Oster G. J. Mol.

Unlike other DNA helicases of this family, T7 DNA helicase preferentially uses dTTP for translocation and DNA unwinding (15Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Matson S.W. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14017-14024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For T7 DNA helicase to initiate unwinding of a duplex DNA molecule it requires a preformed fork bearing a 5′-single-stranded tail of greater than 17 nucleotides and a 3′-tail of at least 7 nucleotides (16Matson S.W. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14017-14024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ahnert P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32267-32273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). gp4 assembles on the 5′-ssDNA tail and the 3′-tail prevents duplex DNA from entering the central core (18Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A report on E. coli DnaB helicase provides evidence that the 3′ arm plays a role analogous to a mechanical fulcrum for the hexameric helicase bound to the 5′ arm, necessary to provide mechanical support for the advancing helicase on the opposite strand of the DNA (19Galletto R. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the interaction site of the helicase, if any, during unwinding of DNA with the excluded strand is not known. The crystal structures of T7 DNA helicase are in the absence of DNA so it is not known if the assembly of gp4 on duplex DNA differs from that on ssDNA. Mechanistically, the interaction of the helicase with the two strands of duplex DNA during unwinding is important for differentiating whether the helicase destabilizes duplex DNA (active helicase) or opportunistically translocates onto thermally open DNA (passive helicase). In earlier studies, a random mutagenesis of gene 4 revealed residues (Ser345 and Gly451 in the helicase domain) to be important for DNA unwinding (20Washington M.T. Rosenberg A.H. Griffin K. Studier F.W. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26825-26834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Arg522 (the arginine finger) and Lys467 (central β-hairpin) mutations also lead to a loss of DNA unwinding (21Crampton D.J. Guo S. Johnson D.E. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4373-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Satapathy A.K. Kochaniak A.B. Mukherjee S. Crampton D.J. van Oijen A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6782-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that each of these amino acid residues resides at the subunit interface of the hexameric gp4 and all of the mutants retain the ability to hydrolyze dTTP (supplemental Fig. S1). From examination of the crystal structure of gp4, we have identified a β-hairpin located at the subunit interface that includes residues 522 through 530 (Fig. 1). The β-hairpin starts with the arginine finger (Arg522) followed by Phe523 and eight other residues (Thr524-Gly-Asp-Thr-Gly-Ile-Ala530). This β-hairpin adopts different orientations depending upon the availability of nucleotide in the nucleotide-binding site at the subunit interface. In the presence of a nucleotide, Phe523 is buried within the subunit interface, and Arg522 contacts the γ-phosphate of the nucleotide (Fig. 1B). However, in the absence of a nucleotide, the β-hairpin undergoes a conformational change such that Arg522 makes a hydrogen bridge with Glu348 from the adjacent subunit and Phe523 is more exposed toward the exterior surface of gp4 (Fig. 1C). In the present study, we substituted Phe523 with a variety of amino acids and examined the ability of these altered helicases to support T7 growth. We also determined the biochemical properties of these helicases in isolation or in association with T7 DNA polymerase. Our results show that Phe523 plays a crucial role in coupling NTP hydrolysis with DNA unwinding by stabilizing the excluded strand by hydrophobic interactions. E. coli C600, E. coli HMS174 (DE3), and pET11b were from Novagen. Wild-type and gene 4-deficient T7 phage (T7Δ4) were from the laboratory collection. Oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies. M13 ssDNA and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs. The site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene. All chemicals and reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. E. coli C600 cells transformed with a plasmid that expresses gene 4 under a T7 promoter were grown to an A600 of 1. Serially diluted T7 phage stocks were mixed with an aliquot of the E. coli culture in 0.7% soft agar and poured onto LB plates with appropriate antibiotics. After incubation for 4–6 h at 37 °C, the number of plaques that appeared was counted. The number of plaques formed by plasmids harboring wild-type gp4 was normalized to 1. The relative efficiency of plating obtained with the altered gene 4 constructs was determined by the number of plaques formed by the mutated gene 4 constructs divided by the number of plaques formed of wild-type gene 4. Plasmid pET11gp4-63 was used for expression and overproduction of wild-type gp4 (23Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27208-27213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid was also used to create point mutations by using the QuikChange II Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of primers used to construct various single mutations are available on request. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Constructs harboring wild-type or mutated gene 4 were transferred to E. coli strain HMS174 (DE3) for overproduction of the corresponding proteins. Wild-type and altered gene 4 proteins were purified as described earlier (10Crampton D.J. Mukherjee S. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The purified proteins are >95% pure as judged by Coomassie staining of the proteins on a polyacrylamide gel (supplemental Fig. S2). dTTP hydrolysis assays were carried out at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 100 nm gp4, 5 nm M13 ssDNA, and the indicated concentration of [α-32P]dTTP (22Satapathy A.K. Kochaniak A.B. Mukherjee S. Crampton D.J. van Oijen A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 6782-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 25 mm to stop the reaction and then the reaction sample was kept on ice. The product of hydrolysis of [α-32P]dNDP was separated from [α-32P]dNTP on polyethyleneimine-coated TLC plates using 0.5 m formic acid and 0.5 m lithium chloride. The TLC plates were scanned in a phosphorimager (Fuji) and the intensity of the spots was measured using ImageQuant software (Fuji). The data were further analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. A nitrocellulose filter-binding assay was used for measuring the ability of gp4 to bind to ssDNA or duplex DNA. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing either 1 nm 5′-32P-labeled 95-mer oligonucleotide (5′-T39 GGC ATG TCA CGA CGT TGT AAA ACG ACG GCC AGT GAA TTC GAG CTC GGT ACC CGG CG-3′) or 1 nm 5′-32P-labeled 95-mer oligonucleotide partially annealed to a 75-mer oligonucleotide (5′-CGC CGG GTA CCG AGC TCG AAT TCA CTG GCC GTC GTT TTA CAA CGT CGT GAC ATG CCT19-3′). These DNAs were incubated with different concentrations (25–250 nm) of gp4 in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 50 mm potassium glutamate, and 1 mm β,γ-methylene dTTP at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were filtered through two layers of membranes, a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm) laid above a Zeta Probe (Bio-Rad) membrane. After washing with the buffer three times, protein-DNA complex bound to the nitrocellulose membrane and free DNA bound to the Zeta Probe membrane were measured with a Fuji/BAS 1000 Bioimaging analyzer. The substrate for DNA unwinding assays was prepared by annealing a 5′-32P-end-labeled 75-mer oligo (5′-CGC CGG GTA CCG AGC TCG AAT TCA CTG GCC GTC GTT TTA CAA CGT CGT GAC ATG CCT19-3′) with an unlabeled 95-mer oligo (5′-T39 GGC ATG TCA CGA CGT TGT AAA ACG ACG GCC AGT GAA TTC GAG CTC GGT ACC CGG CG-3′). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 100 nm labeled DNA substrate, 50 nm gp4, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 50 mm potassium glutamate, and 1 mm dTTP were incubated at 37 °C for up to 10 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.4% (w/v) SDS, 40 mm EDTA, 8% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue to the final concentrations. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were separated from the duplex substrate in a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Image intensities were quantified using Image Gauge and GraphPad Prism software. gp4s were examined for their ability to oligomerize in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable dTTP analog (β,γ-methylene dTTP). The reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 2 μm (monomer) gp4, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 0.01 to 1 mm β,γ-methylene dTTP and 1 μm 50-mer ssDNA were incubated for 20 min at 37 οC. The reactions were stopped by the addition of glutaraldehyde to 0.033% (v/v). The reaction sample was kept at 37 οC for another 5 min, and the reaction products were analyzed on a nondenaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel using a running buffer of 0.25× TBE. After staining with Coomassie Blue, the oligomerization status of gp4 was determined by gel analysis as described (24Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mobility of hexamers and heptamers were distinguished as described earlier (25Crampton D.J. Ohi M. Qimron U. Walz T. Richardson C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 667-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The density of protein bands corresponding to monomers and higher order oligomers in each lane were measured by AlphaEase FC software (AlphaImager 3400). The fraction of hexamers formed from monomers was determined by the density of hexamers and higher order oligomers divided by the total density of protein bands in the corresponding lane as described earlier (26Picha K.M. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27315-27319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Satapathy A.K. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23113-23120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The fraction of hexamers formed was plotted against the concentration of β,γ-methylene dTTP and obtained the apparent dissociation constant (KD) for hexamer formation (26Picha K.M. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27315-27319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Satapathy A.K. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23113-23120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). M13 circular dsDNA having a 5′-tail was used to monitor strand-displacement DNA synthesis. A replication fork was constructed by annealing M13 ssDNA to an oligonucleotide (5′-T36AAT TCG TAA TCA TGG TCA TAG CTG TTT CCT-3′) having 30 bases complementary to the M13 ssDNA and 36 bases forming a 5′-tail. Then gp5/trx was used to convert the ssDNA circle to dsDNA circle. Phenol/chloroform was used to remove gp5/trx. Strand-displacement synthesis assay was carried out at 37 °C in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 10 nm gp5/trx, 20 nm wild-type or altered gp4 (hexamer), 500 μm each of dATP, [α-32P]dTTP (10 Ci/mmol), dCTP, and dGTP, and 10 nm M13 double-stranded DNA. After incubation of the reactions up to 30 min, the reaction was stopped with EDTA at a final concentration of 25 mm and then the mixture was spotted onto DE81 filter paper. After washing 3 times with 0.3 m ammonium formate and 100% ethanol, incorporated [32P]dTMP was measured in a liquid scintillating counter (28Satapathy A.K. Crampton D.J. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14286-14295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Phage λ DNA molecules containing a replication fork were attached with the end of one strand to the glass surface of a flow cell via the biotin-SA link and with the other end to a 2.8-μm paramagnetic bead (Dynal) via digoxigenin-antidigoxigenin as described previously (29Lee J.B.

Tabor S. van Oijen A.M. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 539-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To prevent nonspecific interactions between the beads and the surface, a 1 piconewton magnetic force was applied upward by positioning a permanent magnet above the flow cell. Beads were imaged with a CCD camera with a time resolution of 500 ms, and the centers of their positions for every acquisition time point were determined by particle-tracking software. Bead-bound and surface-tethered DNA were preincubated with 100 nm T7 gp5/trx and 50 nm T7 gp4 (wild-type gp4, gp4-F523H, or gp4-F523V) in replication buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml of BSA) with 600 μm each dNTP and 10 mm DTT for 15 min. Next, the flow cell was washed with replication buffer with dNTPs and DTT. Finally, DNA synthesis was initiated by introducing replication buffer with dNTPs, DTT, and 10 mm MgCl2. After particle tracking, traces were corrected for residual instabilities in the flow by subtracting traces corresponding to tethers that were not enzymatically altered. Bead displacements were converted into numbers of nucleotides synthesized using the known length difference between ssDNA and dsDNA at our experimental conditions (29Lee J.B. Hite R.K. Hamdan S.M. Xie X.S. Richardson C.C. van Oijen A.M. Nature. 2006; 439: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Protein interactions were measured using surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance was performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument. Wild-type or altered gp4 were immobilized (3000 response units) on a CM-5 (carboxymethyl-5) chip using EDC/NHS chemistry. Immobilization was performed in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Binding studies were performed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 250 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm DTT, at a flow rate of 40 μl/min (30Hamdan S.M. Johnson D.E. Tanner N.A. Lee J.B. Qimron U. Tabor S. van Oijen A.M. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 539-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The chip surface was regenerated using 1 m NaCl at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. As a control, a flow cell was activated and blocked in the absence of protein to account for changes in the bulk refractive index. gp5/trx (0.1 to 3 μm) was flowed over the bound gp4 as shown in the Fig. 7A. Apparent binding constants were calculated under steady-state conditions and the data were fitted using BIAEVAL 3.0.2 software (Biacore). To examine the binding of gp5/trx to gp4 in the presence of primer-template, biotinylated DNA was coupled to a streptavidin-coated chip as previously described (see Fig. 7B). A template strand was used with a biotin group attached to 3′-end, and an annealed primer (30Hamdan S.M. Johnson D.E. Tanner N.A. Lee J.B. Qimron U. Tabor S. van Oijen A.M. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 539-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The template DNA was coupled at a concentration of 0.25 μm in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Binding studies of gp5/trx were performed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm DTT, 200 mm potassium glutamate, and 1% (w/v) glycerol at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. gp5/trx was injected at a concentration of 0.2 μm in a flow buffer containing 1 mm dGTP and 10 μm ddATP: a saturating 1:1 binding condition between gp5/trx and primer-template. gp4 was injected over the chip in the above buffer containing 0.1 mm ATP and 2 mm dGTP. A flow cell blocked with biotin was used as a control to measure nonspecific interaction and bulk refractive index of the sample buffer containing gp4. The chip surface was stripped of bound proteins by sequential injections of 150 μl of 1 m NaCl at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. The effect of the genetically altered gene 4 proteins on the growth of T7 phage was examined (Table 1). T7Δ4 phage, lacking gene 4, are dependent on the expression of plasmid-encoded gene 4 protein for viability (31Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10638-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To ascertain the role of Phe523, gene 4 mutants were constructed in which Phe523 was replaced with alanine (gp4–523A), valine (gp4–523V), isoleucine (gp4–523I), leucine (gp4–523L), histidine (gp4–523H), or tyrosine (gp4–523Y). Plasmids encoding gp4-F523I, gp4-F523L, gp4-F523H, and gp4-F523Y complemented the growth of T7Δ4 with similar levels of efficiency of plating as wild-type gp4 (Table 1). In contrast, gp4-F523A and gp4-F523V did not support the growth of T7Δ4 phage. Wild-type T7 phage grow normally in the presence of these altered helicases.TABLE 1Plating efficiency of T7Δ4 on E. coli containing plasmids expressing wild-type or altered gene 4 proteinspET11b:gp4 constructEfficiency of plating T7Δ4Wild-type1F523A≤10−9F523V≤10−9F523I0.9F523L0.8F523H0.9F523Y0.8 Open table in a new tab The proteins coded by Phe523-altered constructs were overproduced, purified, and characterized biochemically. To determine whether Phe523 plays a role in DNA-dependent hydrolysis of dTTP, we measured dTTP hydrolysis activity of the gene 4 proteins in the presence of M13 ssDNA (Fig. 2). All of the altered proteins had DNA-dependent dTTP hydrolysis activity albeit with reduced efficiency. The kinetic parameters of these assays are presented in Table 2. gp4-F523A, gp4-F523V, and gp4-F523H exhibited about 20–30% of dTTP hydrolysis activity. However, only gp4-F523H complemented the growth of T7Δ4 phage. gp4-F523I, gp4-F523L, and gp4-F523Y exhibited 60–70% of dTTP hydrolysis activity as compared with that of wild-type gp4 and all of them complemented gene 4 function in vivo. Despite the differences in the maximal rate of dTTP hydrolysis activity among the Phe523-altered helicases, the calculated kcat/Km values for each of these proteins are comparable with the wild-type gp4 (7.6 s−1 mm−1). In the absence of ssDNA gp4 hydrolyzes dTTP at a significantly slower rate (10Crampton D.J. Mukherjee S. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and this observation also is true for the altered proteins (Table 2). All of the proteins have significant activity in the absence of ssDNA although there is a considerable variation in the ability of the altered gp4 to hydrolyze dTTP. Altogether, results show that Phe523-altered proteins retained dTTP hydrolysis activity.TABLE 2dTTP hydrolysis activity of wild-type gp4 and the gp4 variantsgp4-helicaseNo M13 ssDNA5 nm M13 ssDNAKDNAkcatKmkcat/KmRelative kcatkcatKmkcat/KmRelative kcats−1mms−1 mm−1s−1mms−1 mm−1nmWild-type0.24 ± 0.020.07 ± 0.023.410017.6 ± 12.3 ± 0.37.61000.14F523A0.07 ± 0.010.2 ± 0.010.35293.9 ± 0.70.5 ± 0.37.8220.54F523V0.12 ± 0.010.2 ± 0.030.6503.7 ± 0.80.5 ± 0.37.4210.91F523I0.15 ± 0.020.3 ± 0.020.56212.4 ± 1.21.6 ± 0.47.7700.29F523L0.35 ± 0.030.2 ± 0.031.7514510.8 ± 0.91.3 ± 0.38.3610.38F523H0.12 ± 0.010.1 ± 0.011.2505.4 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.110.8310.13F523Y0.63 ± 0.040.2 ± 0.043.152629.9 ± 0.81.1 ± 0.39560.37 Open table in a new tab Furthermore, we have measured the effect of ssDNA concentration on DNA-dependent dTTP hydrolysis (Fig. 2B and Table 2). All of the altered gp4 (except gp4-F523A and gp4-F523V) bind M13 ssDNA with a KD of 0.1–0.3 nm, a value comparable with that observed with wild-type gp4 (KD = 0.1 nm). gp4-F523A and gp4-F523V bind M13 ssDNA relatively less tightly than does wild-type gp4 with a KD of 0.5 and 0.9 nm, respectively. This weaker binding affinity could account for the lower rate of dTTP hydrolysis activity by gp4-F523A and gp4-F523V. However, the lower rate of dTTP hydrolysis catalyzed by gp4-F523H cannot be explained in this experiment. Upon binding of dTTP, Phe523 in the β-hairpin is located in the NTP-binding site. In the empty state Phe523 is oriented toward the outer surface of the helicase (Fig. 1). This reorientation suggests a role for Phe523 in helicase activity. Initially, the altered proteins were compared with wild-type gp4 for their ability to unwind dsDNA with a replication fork at one end. Wild-type gp4 will initiate unwinding on a duplex DNA molecule provided a preformed replication fork is present at one end of the DNA. The preformed fork consists of a 5′-single-stranded tail of 39 nucleotides and a 3′-single-stranded tail of 19 nucleotides (Fig. 3A). On this DNA gp4 can assemble on the 5′-tail and initiate unwinding, whereas it cannot on a DNA molecule having only a 3′- or 5′-tail or a blunt end (Fig. 3A). In this assay one strand of the duplex is labeled at its 5′ terminus with 32P, which is released as ssDNA in unwinding by the helicase. Duplex and ssDNA can be identified by electrophoresis through nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 3B). Using the DNA molecule with the preformed replication fork we find that gp4-F523A, and gp4-F523V, does not catalyze unwinding of the DNA. Interestingly, despite the reduced levels (∼30%) of dTTP hydrolysis, gp4-F523H exhibited the highest level of unwinding activity (∼70%) among all the Phe523 altered proteins. gp4-F523I, gp4-F523L, and gp4-F523Y can unwind the DNA but not as efficiently as wild-type gp4. Although gp4-F523I retains 30% of the activity of wild-type gp4, gp4-F523L and gp4-F523Y retain up to 50%, as calculated from the exponential phase of the reactions. These results demonstrate that small residues like alanine and valine cannot substitute for phenylalanine. However, hydrophobic residues with longer side chains like leucine and isoleucine can partially substitute, and amino acids with aromatic side chains such as tyrosine and histidin"
https://openalex.org/W2049206915,"Cellular and mitochondrial metabolite levels were measured in yeast TCA cycle mutants (sdh2Δ or fum1Δ) lacking succinate dehydrogenase or fumarase activities. Cellular levels of succinate relative to parental strain levels were found to be elevated ~8-fold in the sdh2Δ mutant and ~4-fold in the fum1Δ mutant, and there was a preferential increase in mitochondrial levels in these mutant strains. The sdh2Δ and fum1Δ strains also exhibited 3-4-fold increases in expression of Cit2, the cytosolic form of citrate synthase that functions in the glyoxylate pathway. Co-disruption of the SFC1 gene encoding the mitochondrial succinate/fumarate transporter resulted in higher relative mitochondrial levels of succinate and in substantial reductions of Cit2 expression in sdh2Δsfc1Δ and fum1Δsfc1Δ strains as compared with sdh2Δ and fum1Δ strains, suggesting that aberrant transport of succinate out of mitochondria mediated by Sfc1 is related to the increased expression of Cit2 in sdh2Δ and fum1Δ strains. A defect (rtg1Δ) in the yeast retrograde response pathway, which controls expression of several mitochondrial proteins and Cit2, eliminated expression of Cit2 and reduced expression of NAD-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (Idh) and aconitase (Aco1) in parental, sdh2Δ, and fum1Δ strains. Concomitantly, co-disruption of the RTG1 gene reduced the cellular levels of succinate in the sdh2Δ and fum1Δ strains, of fumarate in the fum1Δ strain, and citrate in an idhΔ strain. Thus, the retrograde response is necessary for maintenance of normal flux through the TCA and glyoxylate cycles in the parental strain and for metabolite accumulation in TCA cycle mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2032294845,"The CYTH superfamily of proteins is named after its two founding members, the CyaB adenylyl cyclase from Aeromonas hydrophila and the human 25-kDa thiamine triphosphatase. Because these proteins often form a closed β-barrel, they are also referred to as triphosphate tunnel metalloenzymes (TTM). Functionally, they are characterized by their ability to bind triphosphorylated substrates and divalent metal ions. These proteins exist in most organisms and catalyze different reactions depending on their origin. Here we investigate structural and catalytic properties of the recombinant TTM protein from Nitrosomonas europaea (NeuTTM), a 19-kDa protein. Crystallographic data show that it crystallizes as a dimer and that, in contrast to other TTM proteins, it has an open β-barrel structure. We demonstrate that NeuTTM is a highly specific inorganic triphosphatase, hydrolyzing tripolyphosphate (PPP(i)) with high catalytic efficiency in the presence of Mg(2+). These data are supported by native mass spectrometry analysis showing that the enzyme binds PPP(i) (and Mg-PPP(i)) with high affinity (K(d) < 1.5 μm), whereas it has a low affinity for ATP or thiamine triphosphate. In contrast to Aeromonas and Yersinia CyaB proteins, NeuTTM has no adenylyl cyclase activity, but it shares several properties with other enzymes of the CYTH superfamily, e.g. heat stability, alkaline pH optimum, and inhibition by Ca(2+) and Zn(2+) ions. We suggest a catalytic mechanism involving a catalytic dyad formed by Lys-52 and Tyr-28. The present data provide the first characterization of a new type of phosphohydrolase (unrelated to pyrophosphatases or exopolyphosphatases), able to hydrolyze inorganic triphosphate with high specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2079665959,"The cold-sensitive single-residue mutation of glycine 680 in the reactive thiol region of Dictyostelium discoideum myosin-2 or the corresponding conserved glycine in other myosin isoforms has been reported to interfere with motor function. Here we present the x-ray structures of myosin motor domain mutants G680A in the absence and presence of nucleotide as well as the apo structure of mutant G680V. Our results show that the Gly-680 mutations lead to uncoupling of the reactive thiol region from the surrounding structural elements. Structural and functional data indicate that the mutations induce the preferential population of a state that resembles the ADP-bound state. Moreover, the Gly-680 mutants display greatly reduced dynamic properties, which appear to be related to the recovery of myosin motor function at elevated temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1988044973,"The gelsolin family of actin regulatory proteins is activated by Ca2+ to sever and cap actin filaments. Gelsolin has six homologous gelsolin-like domains (G1–G6), and Ca2+-dependent conformational changes regulate its accessibility to actin. Caenorhabditis elegans gelsolin-like protein-1 (GSNL-1) has only four gelsolin-like domains (G1–G4) and still exhibits Ca2+-dependent actin filament-severing and -capping activities. We found that acidic residues (Asp-83 and Asp-84) in G1 of GSNL-1 are important for its Ca2+ activation. These residues are conserved in GSNL-1 and gelsolin and previously implicated in actin-severing activity of the gelsolin family. We found that alanine mutations at Asp-83 and Asp-84 (D83A/D84A mutation) did not disrupt actin-severing or -capping activity. Instead, the mutants exhibited altered Ca2+ sensitivity when compared with wild-type GSNL-1. The D83A/D84A mutation enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity for actin severing and capping and its susceptibility to proteolytic digestion, suggesting a conformational change. Single mutations caused minimal changes in its activity, whereas Asp-83 and Asp-84 were required to stabilize Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound conformations, respectively. On the other hand, the D83A/D84A mutation suppressed sensitivity of GSNL-1 to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate inhibition. The structure of an inactive form of gelsolin shows that the equivalent acidic residues are in close contact with G3, which may maintain an inactive conformation of the gelsolin family.

The gelsolin family of actin regulatory proteins is a major class of Ca2+-dependent actin filament-severing and -capping proteins that regulate dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (1Ono S.

Gelsolin is inactive in the absence of Ca2+, whereas Ca2+ exposes its actin-binding sites and activates its actin filament-severing and barbed end-capping functions. Gelsolin has six repeats of homologous domains of 100–120 amino acids, which are denoted as gelsolin-like domains (G domains) 2The abbreviations used are: G domaingelsolin-like domainGSNL-1gelsolin-like protein-1Cccritical concentrationPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphateBicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. or segments (G1–G6). A Ca2+-free inactive form of gelsolin has a compact globular fold with several interdomain connections, such that actin-binding sites are masked (5Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y.

The C-terminal helical tail binds to the helix in G2, thereby acting as a latch that holds a closed conformation (5Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Ca2+-dependent release of the C-terminal latch is one of the mechanisms to open up gelsolin (10Pope B.J. Gooch J.T. Weeds A.G.

The presence of another latch mechanism between G1 and G3 has been suggested, but it has not been extensively characterized. In an inactive form of gelsolin, G1 and G3 make a close contact by forming a continuous β-sheet and masking actin-binding residues in the long helix of G1 (5Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, the structure of an actin-bound form of G1G2G3 indicates that G1 is moved away from G3 to bind to actin and that G2 and G3 make a close association (9Burtnick L.D. Urosev D. Irobi E. Narayan K. Robinson R.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding to G2 is implicated in stabilizing the G2-G3 association (13Nag S. Ma Q. Wang H. Chumnarnsilpa S. Lee W.L. Larsson M. Kannan B. Hernandez-Valladares M. Burtnick L.D. Robinson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 13713-13718Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, the precise nature of the G1-G3 latch is not clearly understood. We have previously reported that Caenorhabditis elegans gelsolin-like protein-1 (GSNL-1), which has only four G domains (G1–G4), severs actin filaments and caps barbed ends in a similar manner to gelsolin (14Klaavuniemi T. Yamashiro S. Ono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26071-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, unlike gelsolin, GSNL-1 remains bound to the side of actin filaments and does not nucleate actin polymerization (14Klaavuniemi T. Yamashiro S. Ono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26071-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Analysis of the domain-function relationship of GSNL-1 shows that G1 and the linker between G1 and G2 are sufficient for actin filament severing in a similar manner to the equivalent part of vertebrate gelsolin (15Liu Z. Klaavuniemi T. Ono S. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4349-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, an F-actin-binding site of GSNL-1 is present in G3-G4 (15Liu Z. Klaavuniemi T. Ono S. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4349-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas G2 of vertebrate gelsolin binds to F-actin (16Sun H.Q. Wooten D.C. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9473-9479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the G1G2G3 fragment of GSNL-1 severs actin filaments in a Ca2+-dependent manner (15Liu Z. Klaavuniemi T. Ono S. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4349-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas the equivalent fragments of vertebrate gelsolin exhibit Ca2+-independent actin-severing activity (17Bryan J. Hwo S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1439-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Chaponnier C. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1473-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because G4 of GSNL-1 is much shorter than G4–G6 of gelsolin, the C terminus of GSNL-1 may not extend to G2 to function as a latch. This may be the reason why a Ca2+ regulation system is contained within G1G2G3 of GSNL-1. In this study, we originally attempted to identify sequences that are critical for actin filament-severing activity of GSNL-1. Previously, Southwick (19Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 45-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) reported that human CapG, a member of the gelsolin family lacking actin-severing activity, can be converted to an actin filament-severing protein by introducing short gelsolin sequences in G1 and the G1-G2 linker. The critical sequence in G1 is “LDDY” at the C-terminal end of the long helix, whereas the two acidic residues are not conserved in CapG (20Zhang Y. Vorobiev S.M. Gibson B.G. Hao B. Sidhu G.S. Mishra V.S. Yarmola E.G. Bubb M.R. Almo S.C. Southwick F.S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4458-4467Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). GSNL-1 has “IDDS” at the equivalent position (14Klaavuniemi T. Yamashiro S. Ono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26071-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that the two aspartic acid residues are important for actin-severing activity of GSNL-1. Unexpectedly, we found that these acidic residues are dispensable for actin-severing activity of GSNL-1 but rather important for Ca2+ activation and conformational changes of GSNL-1. We propose that this sequence is an important determinant for maintaining active and inactive conformations of the gelsolin family. Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder (Pel-Freeze Biologicals) as described (21Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Pyrene-labeled actin was prepared as described (22Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J.

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (P-4516, Echelon Biosciences) was suspended in water at 1 mg/ml with brief sonication and stored at −20 °C. Bovine pancreas chymotrypsin, which had been treated with 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp., suspended in 1 mm HCl at 1 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C. Site-directed mutagenesis to convert Asp-83 and Asp-84 of GSNL-1 to alanines was performed on expression vectors for full-length GSNL-1 (pGEX-GSNL-1) (14Klaavuniemi T. Yamashiro S. Ono S. J. Biol.

D83A and D84A single mutations were introduced into full-length GSNL-1 (pGEX-GSNL-1) using the following primers: D83A-forward 5′-AAGACTGTAGAGATTGCCGATTCTCTCGGTGGAATTCCAACC-3′, D83A-reverse 5′-GGTTGGAATTCCACCGAGAGAATCGGCAATCTCTACAGTCTT-3′, D84A-forward 5′-AAGACTGTAGAGATTGACGCTTCTCTCGGTGGAATTCCAACC-3′, and D84A-reverse 5′-GGTTGGAATTCCACCGAGAGAAGCGTCAATCTCTACAGTCTT-3′. The sequences of protein coding regions were verified by DNA sequencing. Both wild-type and mutant full-length GSNL-1 and the G1b fragment were expressed as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST) in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously for wild-type proteins (14Klaavuniemi T.

Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4349-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli lysates were applied to a glutathione Uniflow (Clontech) column to adsorb the GST fusion proteins, and then the GSNL-1 variants were cleaved by thrombin (Roche Applied Science) on beads and eluted from the column. They were dialyzed against F-buffer (0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5)) containing 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels after SDS-PAGE using actin as a standard. Microscopic observation of actin filament severing was performed essentially as described previously (15Liu Z. Klaavuniemi T. Ono S. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4349-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Unlabeled G-actin was co-polymerized with DyLight 549-labeled G-actin at 2 μm total actin (20% labeled) for 2 h in F-buffer. Labeled actin was diluted to 0.4 μm in F-buffer with or without GSNL-1 variants in the presence of various concentrations of CaCl2 and EGTA and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated by CHELATER (23Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12 (876–879): 870-874PubMed Google Scholar). Then, the reactions were put on a nitrocellulose-coated coverslip, and immobilized actin filaments on the coverslip were observed by epifluorescence using a Nikon TE2000 microscope with a 60× Plan Apo objective (oil, numerical aperture of 1.4). Images were captured by a SPOT RT monochrome CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments) and processed by IPLab (BD Biosciences) and Adobe Photoshop CS2. Measurements of filament length were performed with IPLab. Varying concentrations of pyrene-labeled G-actin (20% labeled) were polymerized overnight at room temperature in the presence of constant concentrations (50 nm) of GSNL-1 variants in F-buffer containing various concentrations of free Ca2+ as calculated by CHELATER (23Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12 (876–879): 870-874PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity of pyrene (excitation at 366 nm and emission at 384 nm) at the steady state was measured with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer. F-actin sedimentation assays were performed as described (24Mohri K. Vorobiev S. Fedorov A.A. Almo S.C. Ono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31697-31707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Varying concentrations of GSNL-1 variants were added to 5 μm F-actin in F-buffer plus 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the mixtures were ultracentrifuged by a Beckman TLA100 rotor at 436,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatant and pellet fractions were adjusted to the same volumes and subjected to SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (National Diagnostics). Gels were scanned by an Epson Perfection V700 photo scanner at 300 dpi, and band intensity was quantified using ImageJ. Wild-type or mutant GSNL-1 (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with 0.002 mg/ml chymotrypsin in F-buffer in the presence of 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 0.2 mm EGTA at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by mixing with equal volumes of SDS-sample buffer (2% SDS, 80 mm Tris-HCl, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and heating at 98 °C for 3 min. Digestion patterns were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Amounts of intact proteins at time 0 was set as 100%, and remaining intact proteins at each time point were quantified by densitometry. To determine the N-terminal sequence of a 30-kDa chymotryptic fragment, GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) was digested with chymotrypsin in the absence of CaCl2 for 20 min, applied to SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The polypeptide bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The 30-kDa band was excised and subjected to Edman degradation-based N-terminal peptide sequencing using an automated protein sequencer (Procise 491-HT, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to examine PIP2 binding was performed as described (25Safer D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Ono S.

GSNL-1 variants were incubated with PIP2 in G-buffer (0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm DTT, 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were supplemented with 0.25 volume of a loading buffer (50% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed using a Bicine/triethanolamine buffer system at 4 °C. The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (National Diagnostics). Comparison of sequences of the actin-binding helix in the first G-domains (G1s) of human CapG, human gelsolin, and C. elegans GSNL-1 indicated that C. elegans GSNL-1 has a very similar sequence to gelsolin (Fig. 1A). In particular, two aspartic acids at positions 85 and 86 of human gelsolin are conserved in GSNL-1 at positions 83 and 84 but not in CapG (Fig. 1A). Indeed, this region is one of the elements in the gelsolin sequence to confer actin-severing activity to CapG in sequence-swapping experiments and is designated as a “severing loop” (19Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 45-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Zhang Y. Vorobiev S.M. Gibson B.G. Hao B. Sidhu G.S. Mishra V.S. Yarmola E.G. Bubb M.R. Almo S.C. Southwick F.S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4458-4467Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This comparison suggests that these acidic residues play an important role in the actin filament-severing activity of gelsolin and GSNL-1. To investigate the roles of these residues, we generated mutant forms of GSNL-1 by converting both Asp-83 and Asp-84 into alanines (GSNL-1(D83A/D84A)) and converting each aspartic acid residue into alanine (GSNL-1(D83A) and GSNL-1(D84A)) (Fig. 1, A and B). We also introduced the D83A/D84A mutation into the G1b (residues 1–131 of GSNL-1 containing G1 and the G1-G2 linker) fragment, which is the smallest fragment that exhibits strong calcium-dependent actin filament-severing activity (15Liu Z. Klaavuniemi T. Ono S. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4349-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These GSNL-1 variants were bacterially expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and their activities were analyzed in vitro. We first tested the calcium-dependent actin filament-severing activity of GSNL-1 variants by direct observation of fluorescently labeled actin filaments (Fig. 2) and quantitative measurements of filament length (Fig. 2, H–K). Unexpectedly, GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) exhibited stronger Ca2+-dependent actin-severing activity than wild-type GSNL-1 (Fig. 2). DyLight 549-labeled actin filaments were incubated with 20 nm wild-type GSNL-1 or GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) for 5 min, and the actin filaments were observed by fluorescence microscopy. Actin alone (control) did not show a significant difference in the absence or presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). In the presence of 5 mm EGTA or at pCa 6, wild-type GSNL-1 did not sever filaments (Fig. 2, B, C, H, and I), whereas GSNL-1(D83A/D84A), GSNL-1(D83A), and GSNL-1(D84A) slightly shortened filaments (see Fig. 2, H and I, for quantitative results), suggesting that these mutants had weak Ca2+-independent actin-severing activity. At pCa 5 and pCa 4, wild-type GSNL-1 severed filaments (Fig. 2, B, J, and K), and GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) showed stronger severing activity (Fig. 2, C, J, and K). However, single mutants, GSNL-1(D83A) and GSNL-1(D84A), showed slightly weaker severing activity at pCa 5 than wild type (Fig. 2J) and similar severing activity to wild-type GSNL-1 at pCa 4 (Fig. 2K). These results indicate that Asp-83 and Asp-84 are not required for actin filament-severing activity of GSNL-1. Rather, the D83A/D84A mutation enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity for actin filament severing. Single mutations, D83A and D84A, had minor effects on Ca2+ sensitivity, suggesting that Asp-83 and Asp-84 cooperatively regulate Ca2+ sensitivity of GSNL-1. By contrast, in the G1b fragment containing only G1 and the G1-G2 linker, both the wild type and the D83A/D84A mutant were weakly activated at pCa 6 and pCa 5 (Fig. 2, F, G, I, and J) and more strongly at pCa 4 (Fig. 2, F, G, and K). The activities were indistinguishable between wild-type G1b and G1b(D83A/D84A) at pCa 6 and pCa 5 (Fig. 2, F, G, I, and J), whereas G1b(D83A/D84A) showed slightly weaker activity than wild-type G1b at pCa 4 (Fig. 2K). These results suggest that Asp-83 and Asp-84 are not involved in the activation process of the G1b fragment, suggesting that other parts of the molecule are involved in the Asp-83/Asp-84-dependent activation of GSNL-1. To determine whether a conformational change of GSNL-1 is associated with the mutations, we determined susceptibility of wild-type and mutant GSNL-1 to proteolysis by chymotrypsin (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 1). Wild-type GSNL-1 was digested by chymotrypsin more rapidly in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3, black circles) than in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3, white circles), suggesting that Ca2+ induced a conformational change of GSNL-1 to a loose or open conformation. GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) was much more susceptible to chymotryptic digestion regardless of the presence (Fig. 3, black squares) or absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3, white squares). Because GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) is inactive in actin severing in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2H), these results indicate that the D83A/D84A mutation induces a Ca2+-independent open conformation of GSNL-1 while maintaining Ca2+-dependent actin-binding sites. These results are consistent with the studies on gelsolin in which nanomolar concentrations of Ca2+ initiate unlatching of gelsolin while keeping its actin-binding sites inaccessible (10Pope B.J. Gooch J.T. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15848-15855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) was digested much more rapidly than Ca2+-bound wild-type GSNL-1. This suggests that Ca2+ stabilizes an open conformation of GSNL-1, whereas the D83A/D84A mutation disrupts this mechanism. Specific roles of Asp-83 and Asp-84 in conformational stability of GSNL-1 were examined in single mutants. Interestingly, GSNL-1(D83A) was more susceptible to chymotrypsin in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3, white triangles) than in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3, black triangles). In the absence of Ca2+, GSNL-1(D83A) was digested rapidly (Fig. 3, white triangles) in a similar manner to GSNL-1(D83A/D84A), whereas in the presence of Ca2+, GSNL-1(D83A) was as stable as wild-type GSNL-1 (Fig. 3, black triangles). Therefore, the Asp-83 mutant could not maintain a Ca2+-free closed conformation but was able to maintain a Ca2+-stabilized conformation. By contrast, Ca2+-free GSNL-1(D84A) had similar stability to Ca2+-free wild-type GSNL-1 (Fig. 3, white diamonds), whereas Ca2+-bound GSNL-1(D84A) was as unstable as GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) (Fig. 3, black diamonds). Therefore, the Asp-84 mutant had a Ca2+-free closed conformation but could not retain a Ca2+-stabilized conformation. These results indicate that both Asp-83 and Asp-84 are required to regulate Ca2+-dependent conformational changes of GSNL-1 and that Asp-83 and Asp-84 have specific roles in maintaining Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound conformations, respectively. Chymotryptic digestion of both wild-type and mutant GSNL-1 yielded a relatively stable 30-kDa fragment (supplemental Fig. 1, arrowheads). The N-terminal sequence of this fragment was determined as GSMGGTSLD, which corresponded to residues 1–7 (MGGTSLD) of GSNL-1 plus GS at the N terminus as a remnant after cleavage of GST by thrombin. Based on the size of this fragment, the C-terminal end is likely to be Trp-244 (yielding a 28-kDa fragment) or Trp-254 (yielding a 29-kDa fragment), which are located in the G2-G3 linker. This result suggests that the G1-G2 portion of GSNL-1 is relatively stable, and a conformational change occurs at or near the G2-G3 linker. Next, we tested the effect of the mutations on the Ca2+-dependent barbed end-capping activity of GSNL-1. We determined the effects of wild-type or mutant GSNL-1 on the critical concentration (Cc) of actin at various free Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 4). The Cc of uncapped actin is 0.1–0.2 μm, and the amounts of polymerized actin will be linearly correlated with total actin concentrations above the Cc. However, because the Cc at the barbed end (0.1 μm) is much lower than that at the pointed end (0.5 μm), the Cc value of barbed end-capped actin will be near the Cc value at the pointed end (0.5 μm), and polymerized actin will be increased above this higher Cc. In the absence of free Ca2+ (0.2 mm EGTA, Fig. 4A), wild-type and mutant GSNL-1 did not alter the Cc. GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) and GSNL-1(D84A) slightly lowered the pyrene fluorescence (Fig. 4A, white circles and white diamonds). This may be due to weak interaction between GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) or GSNL-1 (D84A) with actin in the absence of free Ca2+, but the mechanism of this effect is currently unclear. By testing various free Ca2+ concentrations, GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) was capable of shifting the Cc at pCa <6 (Fig. 4, D–G, white circles), whereas the capping activity of wild-type GSNL-1 was partially activated at pCa 5 (Fig. 4E, black circles) and fully activated at pCa < 4 (Fig. 4, F and G, black circles). However, single mutations, D83A and D84A, caused different effects on Ca2+ sensitivity. GSNL-1(D83A) was partially activated at pCa 5 (Fig. 4E, black diamonds) and fully activated at pCa 4 (Fig. 4F, black diamonds) in a similar manner to wild type. By contrast, GSNL-1(D84A) required pCa 4 for partial activation (Fig. 4F, white diamonds) and pCa 3 for full activation (Fig. 4G, white diamonds). Thus, although the D83A/D84A double mutation enhances Ca2+ sensitivity of GSNL-1, single mutations had no or negative effects on Ca2+ sensitivity. These results suggest that Asp-83 and Asp-84 play distinct roles in regulating Ca2+ sensitivity of GSNL-1 for its barbed end-capping activity. We previously demonstrated that actin-severing activity of GSNL-1 can be negatively regulated by PIP2 and that PIP2 binds to G1-G2 (15Liu Z. Klaavuniemi T. Ono S. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4349-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We tested whether the D83A/D84A mutation influences PIP2 sensitivity of GSNL-1. In the full-length GSNL-1 protein, GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) was less sensitive to PIP2 than wild-type GSNL-1 (Fig. 5, A and B). Actin filament severing was examined by sedimentation assays using ultracentrifugation. Wild-type GSNL-1 severed actin filaments and decreased pelletable actin in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 5A, black circles) but not in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 5A, black triangles). PIP2 (200 μm) nearly completely inhibited this activity (Fig. 5A, white circles). GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) also exhibited similar Ca2+-dependent actin-severing activity (Fig. 5B, black circles). PIP2 strongly inhibited this activity in the presence of up to 2 μm GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) but only partially inhibited this activity when GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) was present at a high concentration (5 μm) (Fig. 5B, white circles). Interestingly, in the G1b fragment, the D83A/D84A mutation had an opposite effect and enhanced PIP2 sensitivity (Fig. 5, C and D). Wild-type G1b was nearly completely inhibited at low concentrations (up to 2 μm) but only partially inhibited by PIP2 when G1b was present at a high concentration (5 μm) (Fig. 5C, white circles), whereas G1b(D83A/D84A) was nearly completely inhibited by PIP2 (Fig. 5D, white circles). Examination of direct binding of GSNL-1 variants with PIP2 by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis indicated that the D83A/D84A mutation enhanced its binding in both full-length and G1b forms (Fig. 6). In the presence of increasing concentrations of PIP2, the band of full-length wild-type GSNL-1 was shifted to an upper band in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 6A) or a lower band in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 6E), as reported previously (15Liu Z. Klaavuniemi T. Ono S. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4349-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Ca2+ slightly enhanced their binding as the amount of unbound GSNL-1 was less in the presence of Ca2+ at 50 μm PIP2 than in the absence of Ca2+. The band of GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) was shifted to an upper band in the presence of Ca2+ when PIP2 was at 10–50 μm (Fig. 6B). However, at 100 μm PIP2, the band was shifted to a lower band (Fig. 6B). In the absence of Ca2+, the band of GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) was shifted to lower bands (Fig. 6F), and the shift occurred at lower PIP2 concentrations than that of wild-type GSNL-1 (compare Fig. 6, E and F), suggesting that GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) binds to PIP2 with a high affinity in the absence of Ca2+. Wild-type G1b did not show a shift in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 6C), whereas it was shifted to upper smear bands in the presence of EGTA at 100 μm PIP2 (Fig. 6G). G1b(D83A/D84A) also showed a band shift only in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 6, D and H), and the shift of G1b(D83A/D84A) occurred at lower PIP2 concentrations than that of wild-type G1b (compare Fig. 6, G and H). Thus, the D83A/D84A mutation enhanced the PIP2-GSNL-1 binding in both full-length and G1b forms, which indicates that weaker PIP2 sensitivity of full-length GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) is not simply due to an alteration in its affinity with PIP2. In this study, we demonstrated that Asp-83 and Asp-84 of C. elegans GSNL-1 are dispensable for actin filament-severing activity but important for Ca2+-dependent activation and conformational changes of GSNL-1. Full-length GSNL-1 with a D83A/D84A mutation was activated at lower Ca2+ concentrations than wild-type GSNL-1, whereas single mutations at Asp-83 and Asp-84 caused minor effects on activity. Mutations at Asp-83 and Asp-84 caused remarkable changes in the conformation as determined by susceptibility to chymotrypsin digestion, suggesting specific roles for Asp-83 and Asp-84 in maintaining Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound conformations, respectively. Because these aspartic acid residues are conserved in vertebrate gelsolin, we expect that they have similar regulatory functions for Ca2+-dependent properties of vertebrate gelsolin. Although the structure of C. elegans GSNL-1 has not been solved, the crystal structure of a Ca2+-free inactive form of equine gelsolin (PDB accession number 1D0N) indicates that the equivalent aspartic acid residues (Asp-85 and Asp-86) at the C-terminal end of the actin-binding helix of G1 are located near G3 (5Burtnick L.D. Koepf E.K. Grimes J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. McLaughlin P.J. Robinson R.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 661-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). In particular, Asp-86 (equivalent to Asp-84 in GSNL-1) forms a salt bridge with Lys-305, which is located at the N-terminal end of a long helix in G3 (Fig. 7), suggesting that they function as a latch between G1 and G3 to stabilize their binding in its inactive conformation. The crystal structure of a G-actin-bound form of the gelsolin G1G2G3 fragment shows that G1 is separated from G3 in its active form (9Burtnick L.D. Urosev D. Irobi E. Narayan K. Robinson R.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that dissociation of G1 from G3 is an important step during Ca2+ activation of gelsolin. Sequence alignment shows that Lys-309 of C. elegans GSNL-1 is equivalent to Lys-305 of vertebrate gelsolin and may bind to Asp-84 (equivalent to Asp-86 of gelsolin). We attempted to test whether an alanine mutation of Lys-309 causes a similar effect on Ca2+ sensitivity of GSNL-1 to the D83A/D84A mutation. However, the mutant protein was insoluble when it was expressed in E. coli, 3Z. Liu and S. Ono, unpublished data. and we were not able to characterize the effect of this mutation. The D84A single mutation did not disrupt the Ca2+-free inactive conformation (Fig. 3), suggesting that other residues also contribute to the G1-G3 latch. By contrast, Asp-85 (equivalent to Asp-83 in GSNL-1) is not exposed on the surface in the closed conformation (Fig. 7) and may be involved in keeping the internal integrity of the protein. This hypothesis is supported by our data that the D83A single mutation in GSNL-1 specifically disrupted a Ca2+-free conformation. Intriguingly, CapG does not have charged amino acids at equivalent positions in either G1 or G3, suggesting that CapG uses a different mechanism for Ca2+ activation. To uncover the latch mechanism between G1 and G3, we would need an atomic structure of GSNL-1 and/or similar mutagenesis studies on these residues in vertebrate gelsolin. The crystal structure of gelsolin G1-actin complex shows that Asp-85 (reported as Asp-109 in Ref. 27McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) (equivalent to Gly-83 in GSNL-1) is a part of an intermolecular Ca2+-binding site between actin and gelsolin G1 (27McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Biochemical activities of G1 of GSNL-1 are very similar to those of gelsolin G1 (15Liu Z. Klaavuniemi T. Ono S. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4349-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28Kwiatkowski D.J. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results that D83A/D84A and D83A mutations did not impair actin-severing activity of GSNL-1 suggest that the intermolecular Ca2+ binding is not required for actin filament severing. However, the D83A/D84A mutation in the G1b fragment of GSNL-1 slightly reduced actin-severing activity (Fig. 2K). Thus, the intermolecular Ca2+ may stabilize binding of G1b to actin, but this may not be required in the full-length GSNL-1, which has other G domains to augment the severing activity. The D83A/D84A mutation also affected PIP2 sensitivity of GSNL-1. However, the mutation had a different effect on PIP2 sensitivity and PIP2 binding. Full-length GSNL-1 became less sensitive to PIP2 for inhibition of actin severing by the mutation, whereas G1b became more sensitive by the mutation. In contrast, PIP2 binding was enhanced by the mutation in both full-length and G1b forms. Our interpretation is that the D83A/D84A mutation altered the surface charge and the protein conformation, and these two alterations differently affected PIP2 sensitivity and PIP2 binding. The D83A/D84A mutation removes acidic residues that potentially repel PIP2, which is also acidic. Therefore, such a change in the surface charge of GSNL-1 can enhance binding of PIP2 to GSNL-1. PIP2 inhibition of actin-severing activity of the G1b fragment may be due to a competition between actin and PIP2 for binding to G1b. However, PIP2 inhibition of full-length GSNL-1 may require proper conformation of the protein. PIP2 may promote an inactive conformation of GSNL-1, whereas GSNL-1(D83A/D84A) may be unable to form such a conformation due to lack of stable interaction between G1 and G3. To test this hypothesis, additional analysis of the binding between PIP2 and GSNL-1 and studies on the effects of PIP2 on the structure of GSNL-1 will be needed. In conclusion, we provide biochemical evidence that conserved aspartic acid residues in G1 of GSNL-1 are critical determinants of Ca2+-dependent activity and conformations of GSNL-1. The critical function of G1-G3 of GSNL-1 in actin filament-severing activity is similar to that of G1-G3 of gelsolin. Therefore, we expect that equivalent residues in vertebrate gelsolin play similar roles in Ca2+ activation as a putative latch between G1 and G3 and conformational determinants. Our results also suggest that G1-G3 of GSNL-1 forms a compact fold in a similar manner to G1-G3 of gelsolin. Currently, we do not know whether the C terminus of GSNL-1 functions as a latch on G2. G4 of GSNL-1 is most closely related to G6 of gelsolin (14Klaavuniemi T. Yamashiro S. Ono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26071-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the linker between G3 and G4 is much shorter than the equivalent linker in gelsolin. Therefore, it is not clear whether G4 and the C-terminal tail of GSNL-1 have enough size and flexibility to extend to G2. Further structural and biochemical analysis of GSNL-1 should provide interesting information on unique aspects of GSNL-1 as well as conserved properties of the gelsolin family.

https://openalex.org/W2059739624,"In Reply – Dietz and colleagues raise several issues in relation to our article on the assignment of a second locus for MFS: the legitimacy of the MFS diagnosis the reliability of the clinical investigations and hence the validity of our linkage analyses, and so question our conclusion of genetic heterogeneity in MFS.

The diagnosis of MFS was recognized in our family repeatedly and independently by several clinicians before 1986, when the « Berlin nosology[2] » was proposed. After 1986, this diagnosis remained unchanged, notably in subject III-38, when using these recognized criteria. This patient died of an acute aortic dissection and his necropsy showed skeletal abnormalities (height 186 cm, arachnodactyly, pectus excavatum), a past history of surgery for inguinal hernia, and dilation of the ascending aorta[4]. Contrary to the authors’claim, there is no reference in the « Berlin nosology » to the lack of diagnostic significance of a specific physical feature that is not observed in the rest of the family. Eleven other family members (III-4, III-32, III-36, III-37, III-38, III-40, III-42, IV-6, IV-10, IV-49, IV-51) are also considered affected using the same criteria. Furthermore, it cannot be ignored that IV-6 died suddenly at nine years of age after complaining of chest pains, III-32, III-38 and III-42 died of ascertained aortic dissection (a major unquestionable diagnostic criteria for MFS) and III-49 was operated upon for aortic dissection (histologic studies, compatible with the diagnosis and performed in independent institutions from ours, are available for subjects III-32, III-38 and III-49). In addition II-3, II-7 and III-32 are obligate carriers. Because of the absence of ocular involvement, we were compelled to re-name the syndrome «Marfan-like» or even « a new connective-tissue disorder ». However, prominent figures in the field[10] (and the reviewers of our paper[1]) did not endorse this volte-face and considered MFS as the diagnosis, based on the original clinical features of the family published in 1993 [4].

In contrast, Dietz et al. disprove the diagnosis. This is their right. However, we cannot accept their biased reinterpretation of our data which is performed with a mind set on demonstrating the existence of two independent genetic traits in this family and in which each clinical feature is weighed one by one regardless of the overall clinical presentation of a given individual. Despite their claim that the normalization methods they used are « the same[3]» as comparable to those we reported, this is not the case. In effect, with their methods, stature is abnormal in only 11 subjects (versus 18 as compared to the French normal values (see ref. [4]) and the upper segment-to-lower segment ratio is aberrant in 11 patients, none of which have short limbed dwarfism.

Similarly, the criteria they used to standardize our aortic diameter measurements were obtained with a different technique applied to a different level of the aorta[6]. In effect, we used M-mode guided by two dimensional (2-D) echocardiography (and not 2-D echocardiography alone) and measured the aortic diameter always at the same level, namely when 2 aortic cusps were visualized[12] (and not the widest diameter of the sinuses of Valsalva). As reported by Roman et al[6], the M-mode diameter is smaller than the diameter measured at the same level by 2-D echocardiography (30.9 ± 4.2 vs 29.8 ± 3.9; p mean +2 SD with the proper normalization reported in 1993), has an aortic diameter of 48 mm when measured with 2-D echocardiography according to the Roman et al.[6] (also > mean + 2 SD). Consequently, it is not surprising that Dietz et al, find aortic dilation in only 4 individuals. This is in sharp contrast to our data, derived from the appropriate normalizing procedure[12], which revealed aortic dilation in 13 family members. Finally, contrary to what Dietz and colleagues claim, this normalizing procedure[12] does take into account age as well as body surface area and is widely accepted.

Disregarding the manipulation of our published data, the dispute is clearly based upon the examination of the family at large, which lacks one of the major criteria for the diagnosis of MFS (such as eye involvement). But a family of this size is exceptional. We believe that the issue is not whether this is a genuine MFS but is: which diagnosis could unambiguously be made in similar patients in the absence of sufficient family data for linkage analysis or discriminating biological markers?

Our family has been under investigation for many years. Since several clinicians had independently evaluated family members (phenotypic status as given in ref. [5]), all members were re-assessed using more stringent criteria[4]. This led to a change in phenotypic status of some individuals as Dietz et al. correctly note.

Correct discrimination between affected and unaffected individuals is critical for linkage analysis. However, no absolute and definitive rule could be used in the family: the international criteria[2] were clearly inadequate since at least one member (III-49), operated upon because aortic dissection, would not have been recognized by these criteria. Consequently, we developed a pragmatic « case by case » approach[4], which in effect refers to the actual clinical follow-up of these patients. With this classification, we confirmed the exclusion data previously reported with the collagen genes[5], excluded linkage to the fibrillin genes[4], constructed an exclusion map, and established conclusive linkage with 3p markers[1]. In this family, an autosomal dominant disease gene segregates which can be mapped by exclusion mapping[13]. The most likely location is where the highest lod score is obtained. Our lod score is high and remains significant even if we take into account the large number of tests that were performed. Indeed, the 144 markers we studied correspond approximately to 70 independent tests. Since the probability that one of them reaches the 4.89 value is only 1 per 1,000 [14], linkage is established in this family. Furthermore, all the two point, lod scores were computed with complete penetrance. Changing the penetrance at that stage of the analysis would have substantially raised our highest lod score value but was not done. However, the haplotype analysis that was done in the family (after linkage was established) clearly showed that the penetrance was not complete with the clinical criteria we had used to classify family members. Therefore, it was solely to refine the map position of MFS2 with the LINKMAP program that we changed the value of this parameter since the misspecification of penetrance has a strong effect on θ [15].

Finally, the last issue raised by Dietz et al. is that of genetic heterogeneity. Our belief in genetic heterogeneity in MFS stems not only from the linkage data in our family, but also from published data showing that it has been impossible to identify mutations in the fibrillin gene in a number of patients and that in some individuals with « definite Marfan syndrome » no anomaly was observed in fibrillin metabolism. Although it is likely that normal fibrillin metabolism does not exclude the presence of an abnormal fibrillin associated with perturbation of microfibrillar structure and function, microfibrils contain not only fibrillin but also other components. Therefore, it is also possible that these MFS patients have abnormal microfibrillar structure or function due to anomalies carried by another component or by proteins associated with microfibrils. This interpretation has never been seriously considered and no effort has been undertaken to investigate fully the question of genetic heterogeneity despite knowledge, as early as 1991 (refs [16],[17]), that in the French family the mutation locus was not MFS1 (fibrillin). Consequently, it is not surprising that in a family in which fibrillin haplotypes did not segregate in all affected members, heterogeneity was not evoked. The absence of cosegregation was explained by the simultaneous existence of two different connective-tissue disorders (MFS and another still unknown)[18], a very unlikely situation except if one is willing to consider that connective-tissue disorders are frequent. More alarmingly, under the cover of homogeneity, haplotype analyses with fibrillin polymorphic markers were used for diagnosis in an at-risk individual, in a small family in which the presence of a fibrillin defect had not been conclusively demonstrated[18].

Indeed, genetic heterogeneity for MFS is a major issue to which our results make a significant contribution and which now requires a large objective and open-minded collaborative effort, in the interest of patients and their families."

https://openalex.org/W2089819970,"Hyaluronan (HA), a polymeric glycosaminoglycan ubiquitously present in higher animals, is hydrolyzed by hyaluronidases (HAases). Here, we used bee HAase as a model enzyme to study the HA-HAase interaction. Located in close proximity to the active center, a bulky surface loop, which appears to obstruct one end of the substrate binding groove, was found to be functionally involved in HA turnover. To better understand kinetic changes in substrate interaction, binding of high molecular weight HA to catalytically inactive HAase was monitored by means of quartz crystal microbalance technology. Replacement of the delimiting loop by a tetrapeptide interconnection increased the affinity for HA up to 100-fold, with a K(D) below 1 nm being the highest affinity among HA-binding proteins surveyed so far. The experimental data of HA-HAase interaction were further validated showing best fit to the theoretically proposed sequential two-site model. Besides the one, which had been shown previously in course of x-ray structure determination, a previously unrecognized binding site works in conjunction with an unbinding loop that facilitates liberation of hydrolyzed HA."
