https://openalex.org/W2105614108,"A quantum system will stay near its instantaneous ground state if the Hamiltonian that governs its evolution varies slowly enough. This quantum adiabatic behavior is the basis of a new class of algorithms for quantum computing. We tested one such algorithm by applying it to randomly generated hard instances of an NP-complete problem. For the small examples that we could simulate, the quantum adiabatic algorithm worked well, providing evidence that quantum computers (if large ones can be built) may be able to outperform ordinary computers on hard sets of instances of NP-complete problems."
https://openalex.org/W2157680389,"A unique transfer RNA (tRNA)/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair has been generated that expands the number of genetically encoded amino acids in Escherichia coli . When introduced into E. coli , this pair leads to the in vivo incorporation of the synthetic amino acid O -methyl- l -tyrosine into protein in response to an amber nonsense codon. The fidelity of translation is greater than 99%, as determined by analysis of dihydrofolate reductase containing the unnatural amino acid. This approach should provide a general method for increasing the genetic repertoire of living cells to include a variety of amino acids with novel structural, chemical, and physical properties not found in the common 20 amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2074206760,"Structures of a 10-subunit yeast RNA polymerase II have been derived from two crystal forms at 2.8 and 3.1 angstrom resolution. Comparison of the structures reveals a division of the polymerase into four mobile modules, including a clamp, shown previously to swing over the active center. In the 2.8 angstrom structure, the clamp is in an open state, allowing entry of straight promoter DNA for the initiation of transcription. Three loops extending from the clamp may play roles in RNA unwinding and DNA rewinding during transcription. A 2.8 angstrom difference Fourier map reveals two metal ions at the active site, one persistently bound and the other possibly exchangeable during RNA synthesis. The results also provide evidence for RNA exit in the vicinity of the carboxyl-terminal repeat domain, coupling synthesis to RNA processing by enzymes bound to this domain."
https://openalex.org/W2084622414,"The crystal structure of RNA polymerase II in the act of transcription was determined at 3.3 A resolution. Duplex DNA is seen entering the main cleft of the enzyme and unwinding before the active site. Nine base pairs of DNA-RNA hybrid extend from the active center at nearly right angles to the entering DNA, with the 3' end of the RNA in the nucleotide addition site. The 3' end is positioned above a pore, through which nucleotides may enter and through which RNA may be extruded during back-tracking. The 5'-most residue of the RNA is close to the point of entry to an exit groove. Changes in protein structure between the transcribing complex and free enzyme include closure of a clamp over the DNA and RNA and ordering of a series of ""switches"" at the base of the clamp to create a binding site complementary to the DNA-RNA hybrid. Protein-nucleic acid contacts help explain DNA and RNA strand separation, the specificity of RNA synthesis, ""abortive cycling"" during transcription initiation, and RNA and DNA translocation during transcription elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2017662684,"Continuous Global Positioning System sites in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, and northwestern Washington state, USA, have been moving landward as a result of the locked state of the Cascadia subduction fault offshore. In the summer of 1999, a cluster of seven sites briefly reversed their direction of motion. No seismicity was associated with this event. The sudden displacements are best explained by ∼2 centimeters of aseismic slip over a 50-kilometer-by-300-kilometer area on the subduction interface downdip from the seismogenic zone, a rupture equivalent to an earthquake of moment magnitude 6.7. This provides evidence that slip of the hotter, plastic part of the subduction interface, and hence stress loading of the megathrust earthquake zone, can occur in discrete pulses."

However, how we become aware of what we see or of having seen at all is a problem that has eluded neuroscience. Recordings from macaque V1 during deactivation of MT+/V5 and psychophysical studies of perceptual integration suggest that feedback from secondary visual areas to V1 is necessary for visual awareness. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to probe the timing and function of feedback from human area MT+/V5 to V1 and found its action to be early and critical for awareness of visual motion."
https://openalex.org/W1964169699,"Despite widespread interest in the evolution of social intelligence, little is known about how wild animals acquire and store information about social companions or whether individuals possessing enhanced social knowledge derive biological fitness benefits. Using playback experiments on African elephants ( Loxodonta africana ), we demonstrated that the possession of enhanced discriminatory abilities by the oldest individual in a group can influence the social knowledge of the group as a whole. These superior abilities for social discrimination may result in higher per capita reproductive success for female groups led by older individuals. Our findings imply that the removal of older, more experienced individuals, which are often targets for hunters because of their large size, could have serious consequences for endangered populations of advanced social mammals such as elephants and whales."

The nanotubes are up to hundreds of micrometers long and display diverse self-assembly properties on different length scales, ranging from twisted bundles to regularly shaped “furry” forms. The bundles, which contain interstitial iodine, can be readily disassembled into individual molybdenum disulfide nanotubes. The synthesis was performed using a novel type of catalyzed transport reaction including C 60 as a growth promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2004806132,"Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) is a regulator of cell survival and apoptosis. To become fully activated, PKB/Akt requires phosphorylation at two sites, threonine 308 and serine 473, in a phoshpatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-dependent manner. The kinase responsible for phosphorylation of threonine 308 is the PI 3-kinase-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1), whereas phosphorylation of serine 473 has been suggested to be regulated by PKB/Akt autophosphorylation in a PDK-1-dependent manner. However, the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) has also been shown to regulate phosphorylation of serine 473 in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Whether ILK phosphorylates this site directly or functions as an adapter molecule has been debated. We now show by in-gel kinase assay and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry that biochemically purified ILK can phosphorylate PKB/Akt directly. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of cell extracts demonstrates that ILK can complex with PKB/Akt as well as PDK-1 and that ILK can disrupt PDK-1/PKB association. The amino acid residue serine 343 of ILK within the activation loop is required for kinase activity as well as for its interaction with PKB/Akt. Mutational analysis of ILK further shows a crucial role for arginine 211 of ILK within the phosphoinositide phospholipid binding domain in the regulation of PKB- serine 473 phosphorylation. A highly selective small molecule inhibitor of ILK activity also inhibits the ability of ILK to phosphorylate PKB/Aktin vitro and in intact cells.

The molecular basis for this anchorage-dependent cell growth and survival is an intensive area of study, since oncogenically transformed cells very often grow in an anchorage-independent manner. Alterations in anchorage-dependent signaling pathways are also likely to be of importance in tumor progression leading to metastasis. The integrin-linked kinase (ILK)1 is an intracellular protein kinase that couples integrins and growth factors to downstream signaling pathways involved in the suppression of apoptosis and in promoting cell cycle progression. Cell-extracellular matrix interactions stimulate two major signaling pathways, leading to the regulation of cell cycle progression and cell survival. These are the Ras/Raf-MAP kinase pathway, and the protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt) cell survival pathway (5Dedhar S. Curr. Opin Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).

Activated PKB/Akt suppresses apoptosis and anoikis by phosphorylating and inactivating proapoptotic molecules such as Bad, caspase-9, and the forkhead transcription factors. ILK overexpression also stimulates nuclear localization of β-catenin and activation of the β-catenin-Lef-1 transcription factor, probably due to the ILK-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (6D'Amico M.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3069-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it has been suggested by others that ILK may not be an active kinase (9Lynch D.K. Ellis C.A. Edwards A.W. Hiles I.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8024-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and that the ILK-mediated regulation of PKB/Akt serine 473 phosphorylation may be indirect (9Lynch D.K. Ellis C.A. Edwards A.W. Hiles I.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8024-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This skepticism arises from the fact that there are a number of amino acid changes in the kinase catalytic domain of ILK at positions that are typically highly conserved. For instance, the highly conserved GXGXXG sequence found in subdomain I is NENHSG in ILK, and additional variations in ILK are found in the conserved residues in subdomains VIB (HRDL) and VII (DFG). On the other hand, the critical lysine residue between subdomains I and II, involved in the binding of ATP, and the APE region in subdomain VIII are highly conserved. Despite these differences, recent work by Denget al. (16Deng J.T. Van Lierop J.E. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16365-16373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) clearly demonstrates that ILK is a bona fide functional serine-threonine protein kinase. The current model for PKB/Akt activation requires PI 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of threonine 308 and serine 473. The kinase responsible for phosphorylation of threonine 308 has been identified as PI 3-kinase-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) (17Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the regulation of phosphorylation of the hydrophobic site serine 473 has been attributed to autophosphorylation by PKB/Akt (18Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). A role for PDK-1 in the regulation of phosphorylation at this site has also been conjectured by analogy of the ability of PDK-1 to bind to a similar hydrophobic site serine residue in protein kinase C (19Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Le Good J.A. Whelan R.D. Kelly J.J. Frech M. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 522-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C.F. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). PDK-1, by binding to the serine 473 site, is proposed to mask this site. A PDK-1 inhibitory factor (PIF) peptide, generated from PRK-2 (29Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), has been proposed to displace PDK-1 from this site, allowing for autophosphorylation to take place (18Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 21Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence for the existence of a physiologically relevant PIF in cells (18Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Here we show using in-gel kinase assay and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, that ILK can phosphorylate PKB/Akt directly. Mutational analysis reveals a crucial role for amino acids serine 343 and arginine 211 in the activation loop and phosphoinositide phospholipid binding motif of ILK, respectively, in the regulation of phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on serine 473. Interestingly, ILK can complex with PKB/Akt and PDK-1, disrupting PDK-1/PKB interactions and promoting phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on serine 473. Mutations were introduced into V5/His-tagged-ILK-WT pcDNA3.1 using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutant oligonucleotides (with the altered nucleotide(s) underlined) were used to change serine at position 343 to an alanine (S343A, 5′-ATGGCTGATGTCAAGTTCGCTTTCCAATGTCCTGGTCGC-3′), serine at position 343 to an aspartic acid (S343D, 5′-ATGGCTGATGTCAAGTTCGATTTCCAATGTCCTGGTCGC-3′), and arginine at position 211 to an alanine (R211A, 5′-GAGCTATGGAAGGGCGCCTGGCAGGGCAATGAC-3′). Mutant clones were confirmed by sequencing. The PTEN-positive prostate cancer cell line DU145 and the PTEN-null prostate cancer cell line PC3 were used in this study. DU145 and PC3 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. All cells were passaged in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were transiently transfected with His-V5-tagged ILK wild-type (ILK-WT) cDNA, His-V5-tagged ILK kinase-dead (ILK-E359K) cDNA, His-V5-tagged ILK (S343A) cDNA, His-V5-tagged ILK (S343D) cDNA, His-V5-tagged ILK (R211A) cDNA, His-V5-tagged ILK (E359K/S343A) cDNA, His-V5-tagged ILK (E359K/S343D) cDNA, and His-V5-tagged ILK (R211A/S343D) cDNA. Transfections of DU145 cells were carried out by using 6 µl of Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's guidelines, and 2–3 µg of cDNA. Transfection of PC3 cells were carried out by using 4 µl of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's guidelines, and using 2–3 µg of cDNA. Control cells were transfected with empty vector. The ILK cDNAs were in the pc-DNA-3 plasmid. All transfections were carried out overnight, and the cells were harvested for lysis 24–48 h later with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described previously (12Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Delcommenne M. Troussard A. Sanghera J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3207-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Prior to treatment with inhibitors, DU145 and PC3 cells were serum-starved for 18–20 h at 37 °C. For treatment with PI 3-kinase inhibitor, serum-starved cells were incubated with either wortmannin (100 nm) or LY294002 (25 µm) for 1 h in the presence or absence of serum. For treatment with ILK inhibitor KP-SD-1, serum-starved cells were incubated overnight with 50–100 µm inhibitor in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Since all the inhibitors were solubilized in Me2SO, cells were incubated for appropriate times with Me2SO to serve as vehicle control. Protein concentrations were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blot analysis using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out as described previously (8Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Ruel L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-PKB-Ser(P)-473 antibody (rabbit polyclonal; New England Biolabs), anti-PKB antibody (rabbit polyclonal; New England Biolabs), anti-V5 antibody (mouse monoclonal; Invitrogen), anti-ILK antibody (mouse monoclonal), and anti-PDK-1 antibody (mouse monoclonal; BD Biosciences). Equivalent concentrations of purified ILK preparations were incubated using a Beckman Biomark Robotic System. Each well (96-well microtiter plate) contained 15 µl of reaction mixture composed of buffer A (5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 4 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mmEDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 50 µmdithiothreitol, 1 µm β-methylaspartic acid), 50 µm [γ-32P]ATP (2000 cpm/pmol), 5 µg of ILK substrate, and S6 substrate peptide (CKRRRLASLR). The kinase reaction was carried out for 15 min at room temperature (22 °C). At the end of the reaction period, the reaction mixture was centrifuged, and 20 µl of the supernatant was spotted onto a Millipore Multiscreen plate. The Millipore Multiscreen plate was extensively washed in 1% phosphoric acid, dried, and counted in a Wallac Microbeta scintillation counter. In vitro ILK assays were also carried out in which purified GST-PKB and GST-ILK were co-incubated in the presence of kinase reaction buffer and ATP as described previously (8Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Ruel L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). The kinase assays were carried out in the presence or absence of KP-SD-1. Phosphorylated GST-PKB was resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-PKB-Ser(P)-473 antibody (rabbit polyclonal; New England Biolabs). In addition, in vitro kinase assays were also carried out using Mono Q fractions containing ILK partially purified from chicken gizzard smooth muscle (16Deng J.T. Van Lierop J.E. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16365-16373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and either the 20-kDa light chain of smooth muscle myosin II (MLC-20) as substrate and [γ-32P]ATP as the phosphate donor or GST-PKB-Ala-308 as substrate and ATP as phosphate donor. Phosphorylated MLC-20 was detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, and phosphorylated GST-PKB was resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-PKB-Ser(P)-473 antibody (rabbit polyclonal; New England Biolabs). Mono Q fractions (16Deng J.T. Van Lierop J.E. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16365-16373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) were mixed with 4 µl of 4× SDS gel sample buffer and incubated at 20 °C for 2 h prior to electrophoresis. Two 10% polyacrylamide gels were prepared: one with the protein substrate GST-PKB-Ala-308 (60 µg/ml) incorporated into it and one without any substrate. After electrophoresis, the gels were first washed with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm dithiothreitol) containing 2.5% SDS and then washed with kinase buffer without SDS overnight at 4 °C. The gels were then incubated with fresh kinase buffer containing 200 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 3 h at 25 °C. The gels were thereafter washed extensively with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate, stained with Coommassie Blue, destained, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. A major radioactive band with an apparent molecular mass of 59-kDa kinase was detected in the substrate-containing gel. This 59-kDa band was excised from the gel, and MALDI-TOF analysis was performed on this band after trypsin digestion by Borealis Biosciences Inc. (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). GST-ILK fusion protein was expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus system. The open reading frame from an ILK cDNA was amplified using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs), inserted into transfer vector pAcG2T (Pharmingen), and verified by ABI PRISM cycle sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). This plasmid was then co-transfected with BaculoGold DNA (Pharmingen) in Sf9 cells to produce the ILK recombinant baculovirus and then used for infection of Hi5 cells (Invitrogen). After 3 days of infection, the cells were lysed by sonication in 10 mm imidizole, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine. ILK protein was purified from these lysates using glutathione-agarose beads. pGEX-PKB Ala308 was expressed in BL21 Codon Plus ‘PR’ bacteria (Stratagene) by induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. Bacteria were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 (wash buffer; Protein Refolding Kit, Novagen) to which was added 100 µg/ml lysozyme, 50 units/ml of a broad spectrum nuclease (Benzonase, Novagen), and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After sonication and further incubation at 4 °C with stirring, the nonsolubilized fraction was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. This inclusion body pellet was washed twice with wash buffer and was solubilized in 50 mm CAPS, 0.3%N-lauroylsarcosine, and protease inhibitors. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min. The soluble inclusion body material was substantially pure GST-PKB Ala308 protein as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. Detergent was removed by exhaustive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. DU145 cells were cultured, transfected, and harvested as described earlier. 250 µg of cell lysate was precleared with 30 µl of rabbit IgG (Sigma)-coated protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma), for 4 h twice at 4 °C with rotation. Lysates were then incubated overnight with 4 µg of the appropriate antibody, followed by incubation with 30 µl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h. Beads were washed in lysis buffer five times, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with the appropriate antibody, as described above. ILK can interact with the cytoplasmic domains of integrin β1 and β3 subunits (14Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S.

Opin Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). ILK contains a phosphoinositide phospholipid binding motif (8Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Ruel L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), and its activity is stimulated in vitro by PI(3,4,5)P3, the product of PI 3-kinase (8Delcommenne M.

A. 2000; 97: 3207-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Despite prior demonstration of the ability of recombinant ILK to phosphorylate PKB/Akt at serine 473 in vitro, it has been suggested that ILK may regulate this phosphorylation of PKB/Akt indirectly rather than by direct phosphorylation (9Lynch D.K. Ellis C.A. Edwards A.W. Hiles I.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8024-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To determine whether tissue-derived ILK can phosphorylate PKB/Akt directly, we took advantage of a recently described purification and kinase activity analysis scheme for the demonstration of phosphorylation of MLC-20 by ILK (16Deng J.T. Van Lierop J.E. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16365-16373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). ILK was enriched from chicken gizzard extracts using conventional biochemical purification protocols (DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, SP-Sepharose chromatography, and Mono-Q chromatography) described by Deng et al. (16Deng J.T. Van Lierop J.E. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16365-16373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The Mono-Q fractions were then analyzed for PKB/Akt phosphorylation activity by an in-gel kinase assay using purified recombinant PKB/Akt as the substrate. To minimize autophosphorylation and eliminate the role of PDK-1, we used a threonine 308 mutant of PKB (T308A) as the substrate. Purified PKB (T308A) (Fig. 1 A) was incorporated into a 10% polyacrylamide gel. In-gel kinase assays of Mono-Q fractions were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative autoradiograph of one of three separate experiments is shown in Fig. 1 B. A major band capable of phosphorylating PKB (T308A) was detected with a molecular mass of ∼59 kDa in Mono-Q fractions 20–25. Coomassie Blue staining of the gel revealed a single protein band in this location. This band was excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 1 C) (16Deng J.T. Van Lierop J.E. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16365-16373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Comparison of the measured masses of the tryptic peptides with predicted masses from the protein sequence data bases revealed a single match to ILK (Fig. 1 C) (14Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Peptides 1–16 perfectly matched predicted tryptic peptides from chicken ILK (16Deng J.T. Van Lierop J.E. Sutherland C. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16365-16373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and together the 16 peptides accounted for 35% of the complete sequence. No sequences corresponding to any other proteins were obtained. Western blot analyses of the Mono-Q fractions 17–28 with a polyclonal anti-ILK antibody showed that ILK was present in the fractions containing PKB phosphorylatable activity (fractions 20–25). These results confirm that ILK can phosphorylate PKB/Akt. The second minor peak of activity in fractions 26 and 27 migrating with relative molecular masses of 100 and 85 kDa has not been identified yet. We also decided to determine whether the Mono-Q fractions could phosphorylate PKB (T308A) on serine 473 in solution. Aliquots of Mono-Q fractions 18–27 were incubated with either PKB (T308A) or MLC-20. Kinase assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” using either [γ-32P]ATP for phosphorylation of MLC-20 or cold ATP for detection of PKB (T308A) phosphorylation on serine 473 using an anti-PKB-Ser(P)-473 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, a peak of activity is detected in fractions 20–25 for phosphorylation of both MLC-20 and PKB (T308A). Furthermore, the kinase activity in fraction 24 was substantially inhibited in the presence of a highly selective small molecule ILK inhibitor, KP-SD-1 (TableI), demonstrating that the kinase activity in the fractions responsible for phosphorylating PKB on serine 473 is ILK.Table IKinase IC50 valuesKinase1-aCK II, casein kinase II; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; ERK1, extracellular signal regulated kinase 1; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; PAK, p21-activated protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; CDK1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1.IC50KP-1KP-2µmILK10.30.8PKB>50>50CK-II>50>50DNA-PK>50>50ERK1>50>50GSK3-β>50>50LCK30>50MEK>50>50PIMJ>50>50PKA>50>50PAK>50>50PKC>50>50CDK12540SRC>50>501-a CK II, casein kinase II; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; ERK1, extracellular signal regulate"
https://openalex.org/W2045145709,"The initial step in the de novobiosynthesis of cytokinin in higher plants is the formation of isopentenyladenosine 5′-monophosphate (iPMP) from AMP and dimethylallylpyrophosphate (DMAPP), which is catalyzed by adenylate isopentenyltransferase (IPT). Although cytokinin is an essential hormone for growth and development, the nature of the enzyme for its biosynthesis in higher plants has not been identified. Herein, we describe the molecular cloning and biochemical identification of IPTs from Arabidopsis thaliana. Eight cDNAs encoding putative IPT, designated as AtIPT1 to AtIPT8, were picked up from A. thaliana. The Escherichia coli transformants expressing the recombinant proteins excreted cytokinin species into the culture medium except for that expressing AtIPT2 that is a putative tRNA IPT. A purified recombinant AtIPT1 catalyzed the formation of iPMP from DMAPP and AMP. These results indicate that the small multigene family contains both types of isopentenyltransferase, which could synthesize cytokinin and mature tRNA."

In this study, we identified a human lectin binding to galactofuranosyl residues and named this protein human intelectin (hIntL).

The hIntL gene was split into 8 exons on chromosome 1q21.3, and hIntL mRNA was expressed in the heart, small intestine, colon, and thymus. hIntL showed high levels of homology with mouse intelectin,Xenopus laevis cortical granule lectin/oocyte lectin, lamprey serum lectin, and ascidian galactose-specific lectin. These homologues commonly contained no carbohydrate recognition domain, which is a characteristic of C-type lectins, although some of them have been reported as Ca2+-dependent lectins.

The cell wall components of pathogens have various biological activities and contain the bacteria-specific carbohydrate chains that do not exist in mammals. The recognition of these carbohydrate chains is useful to induce the cellular responses and fluid-phase immune reactions for elimination of pathogens. In the innate immune response, the bacterial carbohydrate chains are recognized by the animal lectins that are present on cells as phagocytosis receptors or in plasma as opsonins or agglutinins. As a phagocytosis receptor, the mannose receptor binds materials containing terminal mannosyl residues such as zymosan and enhances their clearance by phagocytes (1Warr G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In addition, the mannose-binding lectin (MBL),1 a typical collectin, and ficolin/P32 form complexes with MBL-associated serine proteases in plasma.

Brennan P.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 383-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, the specific recognition of these galactans is thought to be useful for their uptake into phagocytes. Although the cell wall skeleton of Mycobacterium contains no mannose, it is ingested by phagocytes (21Tsuji S. Matsumoto M. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Azuma I. Hayashi A. Toyoshima K. Seya T. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6883-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In the present study, we purified a novel human galactose-binding lectin and cloned its cDNA. We demonstrated that this lectin, human intelectin (hIntL), is a new type of Ca2+-dependent lectin that has affinity to galactofuranosyl residues and recognizes bacterial arabinogalactan. Galactose-Sepharose was produced by incubating epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with galactose according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human placental tissue was obtained from Kobayashi Maternity Hospital, Osaka, Japan. The syncytial trophoblast layer was scraped from the fresh placenta and stored at −80 °C. The following purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C until column chromatography. Samples of ∼100 g of frozen tissue were homogenized with a Waring blender in 400 ml of 20 mm Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) (TBS) containing 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm iodoacetamide. The homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was then washed twice by homogenization and centrifugation with 200 ml of TBS. The washed pellet was resuspended in 400 ml of TBS containing 10 mm CHAPS, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm iodoacetamide, and then stirred for 18 h. The extract was isolated by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 1 h), CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and then the extract applied to a galactose-Sepharose column (2.0 × 4.8 cm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at room temperature. The column was washed with TBS containing 10 mm CHAPS and 10 mm CaCl2, and the galactose-binding proteins were eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm CHAPS and 10 mm EDTA. The fractions showing absorbance at 280 nm were collected, concentrated with a vacuum concentrator, and dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm CHAPS. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Several bands were cut out from the PVDF membranes stained with Coomassie Blue, and the strips were treated with 0.6 m HCl for 24 h at 25 °C (deblocking of formylation) and stored at −20 °C. These procedures were repeated five times and the strips were used for N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. The purified hIntL was obtained by electro-elution from the 120-kDa band isolated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of hIntL was used to search an expressed sequence tag data base, and the full-length cDNA sequence was deduced. PCR primers were designed on the basis of the predicted sequence (5′-GTG GAG GGA GGG AGT GAA GGA G-3′ and 5′-GAG TCA ATA TGA TTT ATT GTT TTC TCT TCT G-3′). cDNA was synthesized from human placental poly(A)+ RNA using oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). A single band was amplified by PCR using these primers and cDNA (30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min), and the PCR products were directly sequenced using several internal sequence primers. The primer regions were determined using a 5′ or 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Marathon cDNA amplification kit,CLONTECH). The MTN blot membranes containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from various human tissues (CLONTECH) were hybridized at 65 °C for 1 h in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) with 32P-labeled cDNA of open reading frame sequences of hIntL. The blots were washed twice at 37 °C for 30 min in 0.1× SSC (1× SSC is 15 mm sodium citrate containing 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% SDS, and twice at 50 °C for 30 min in 3× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, followed by autoradiography. As a control for hybridization, the blots were rehybridized with a β-actin probe. The rabbit kidney cell line RK-13 were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). cDNA encoding the open reading frame of hIntL was inserted into the mammalian cell expression vector pEF-BOS and transfected into RK-13 with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transfected cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and the culture supernatants were collected. Approximately 1 mg of recombinant human intelectin (rhIntL) was purified from 700 ml of culture supernatant by galactose-Sepharose column chromatography. For preparation of antibodies against hIntL, hIntL-transfected RK-13 (5 × 107 cells) were injected with complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco Laboratories) into a rabbit every week (25Inoue N. Fukui A. Nomura M. Matsumoto M. Toyoshima K. Seya T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Three days after the fourth immunization, antiserum was collected, and the polyclonal antibodies were purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at 33% saturation. The specific anti-hIntL antibodies were isolated from the 33% ammonium sulfate fraction by affinity chromatography using Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) covalently bound to purified rhIntL. rhIntL (0.2 μg) or placental hIntL (0.1 μg) was dissolved in 20 μl of 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% SDS, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mmEDTA, and was denatured by boiling for 5 min. Each solution was divided into two aliquots to which 5 μl of 7.5% Nonidet P-40 and 13.8 μl of distilled water were added. 1.2 μl (0.3 unit) ofN-glycanase (Genzyme Co.) was added to each aliquot, and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. These samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The hIntL treated with N-glycanase was detected by Western blotting. The blotted membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and treated with rabbit anti-hIntL polyclonal antibodies (1.5 μg/ml). After washing, the blots were treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and developed with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 2-Acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-β-d-galactofuranosyl-d-glucopyranose (GalfG) was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (North York, Canada), and other saccharides were obtained from Pfanstiehl Laboratories Inc. (Waukegan, IL). Aliquots of 1 ml of culture supernatant of hIntL-transfected RK-13 were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 15 μl of galactose-Sepharose. The gels were washed five times with TBS containing 10 mm CaCl2, and incubated for 10 min with 20 μl of TBS, containing 10 mmEDTA or containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 100 mm various mono/disaccharides. The eluted samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. The stained gel images were imported into a computer with a scanner, and the densities of bands were measured using the image analysis software (NIH Image for Macintosh). The arabinogalactan of Nocardia rubra (a gift from Prof. I. Azuma, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan) was covalently bound to universal binding 96-well plates (Costar) by UV cross-linking, and the plates were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin. The plates were incubated for 3 h with 100 μl of the culture supernatant of hIntL-transfected RK-13, washed five times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 2 mm CaCl2, and then incubated for 1 h with TBS containing 2 μg/ml specific anti-hIntL antibodies, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 2 mm CaCl2. After washing, the plates were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, developed witho-phenylenediamine and H2O2, and the absorbance at 492 nm was determined. To identify Ca2+-dependent galactose-binding protein, we employed an affinity chromatography method using galactose-Sepharose and protein analysis by SDS-PAGE, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Human placental tissue was used as a protein source, since it produces a variety of lectins and host defense proteins. The N-terminal amino acids of several proteins that showed affinity to galactose-Sepharose were sequenced and an unknown sequence was obtained from a 120-kDa protein under nonreducing conditions. As shown in Fig.1 A, this protein appeared as a 40-kDa single band under reducing conditions. Thus, this 120-kDa protein should be a homotrimer linked by disulfide bonds. We searched the expressed sequence tag data base for the N-terminal amino acid sequence of this 120-kDa protein (Fig. 2,solid underline), and the full-length sequence was deduced. Based on the deduced sequence, PCR primers were designed and used for reverse transcription-PCR using human placental mRNA. The PCR products were directly sequenced, and the primer regions were sequenced by 5′ or 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. As shown in Fig. 2, the cDNA sequence of the 120-kDa protein (GenBank™ accession no. AB036706) contained a ATG translational initiation codon in accordance with Kozak's rule, a 939-base pair open reading frame encoding 313 amino acids, and a polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, followed by a poly(A) tail in the 3′-untranslated sequence. The transcript of this 120-kDa protein cDNA revealed a high degree of homology with the hypothetical protein mouse intelectin (26Komiya T. Tanigawa Y. Hirohashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Hence, we named this protein human intelectin (hIntL). The N-terminal amino acid of the purified placental hIntL was Thr-19, and analysis of the cDNA predicted the presence of a N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence (amino acids 1–18). In addition, hIntL did not contain a significant transmembrane domain. These observations suggested that mature hIntL is a secretory protein. The predicted molecular size of the mature hIntL was calculated to be about 33 k, but the actual size of the placental hIntL was shown to be about 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig.1 A). hIntL contained two potentialN-glycosylation sites at Asn-154 and Asn-163 (Fig. 2). Following N-glycanase treatment, the molecular sizes of both placental and recombinant hIntL were decreased to 34 kDa, which nearly matched the predicted molecular size (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the difference of molecular size appeared to be largely due to the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides. As shown in Fig. 3, the amino acid sequence of hIntL was 81.5% identical to mouse intelectin (26Komiya T. Tanigawa Y. Hirohashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and 59.4% identical to Xenopus laevis cortical granule lectin (GenBank accession no. X82626), the sequence of which was the same as that of X. laevis oocyte lectin (27Lee J.K. Buckhaults P. Wilkes C. Teilhet M. King M.L. Moremen K.W. Pierce M. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) except for 5 amino acids. The highly homologous region (residues 37–313) of these proteins showed partial homology with the C-terminal part ofLampetra japonica lamprey serum lectin (GenBank™ accession no. AB055981) (residues 53–333, 58.1%) or Halocynthia roretzi ascidian galactose-specific lectin (28Abe Y. Tokuda M. Ishimoto R. Azumi K. Yokosawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (residues 69–348, 43.0%). Thus, hIntL is likely to be a human homologue of these molecules. Placental hIntL showed Ca2+-dependent saccharide binding activity as similarly to cortical granule lectin/oocyte lectin, but hIntL did not contain the carbohydrate recognition domain, which is a characteristic of C-type lectins. Moreover, hIntL did not contain any known functional domains, except the region from Pro-38 to Val-82 that was similar to part of the fibrinogen domain. A human genome sequence data base search indicated that the human intelectin gene (Itln) was contained in a chromosome 1 clone (GenBank™ accession no. AL354714). The exon-intron junctions were determined by comparing the genomic sequence with that of hIntL cDNA. As shown in Fig. 4, human Itln was split into 8 exons and the open reading frame was located within exons 2–8. The nucleotide sequences of all exon-intron junctions fulfilled the GT-AG rule. Analysis of some sequences (GenBank™ accession nos.AL162592, AL354714, AC068728, and AL121985) indicated thatItln was located between junction adhesion molecule and Ly-9, which was followed by CD48. Since these molecules were reported to be located on chromosome 1q21.3–22 (29Naik U.P. Naik M.U. Eckfeld K. Martin-DeLeon P. Spychala J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 539-547PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sandrin M.S. Henning M.M. Lo M.F. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. McKenzie I.F. Immunogenetics. 1996; 43: 13-19PubMed Google Scholar, 31Staunton D.E. Fisher R.C. LeBeau M.M. Lawrence J.B. Barton D.E. Francke U. Dustin M. Thorley-Lawson D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1087-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), Itln would be located on chromosome 1q21.3–22. Northern blotting analysis of hIntL mRNA showed that the transcript size was 1.35 kilobase pairs (Fig. 5). It has been reported that mouse intelectin is specifically expressed in the small intestine (26Komiya T. Tanigawa Y. Hirohashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), but hIntL mRNA was also expressed in the heart, small intestine, colon, and thymus, and to a lesser degree in the uterus and spleen. hIntL was purified and cloned from the placenta, but placental hIntL mRNA was barely detected on Northern blotting. Therefore, hIntL appeared not to be a major product in the placenta. For biochemical analysis of hIntL, the hIntL cDNA was cloned into the vector pEF-BOS and transfected into the rabbit kidney cell line RK-13. The recombinant hIntL (rhIntL) was affinity-purified from the cell lysates and the culture supernatants with galactose-Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+ and was eluted with EDTA. As shown in Fig.6, rhIntL was purified from both lysates and culture supernatants of hIntL-transfected cells, but not those of mock cells transfected with the empty vector. The rhIntL was the same molecular size as native placental hIntL under non-reducing or reducing conditions (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, the molecular sizes of rhIntL and native placental hIntL were similarly decreased byN-glycanase treatment (Fig. 1 B). These results indicated that rhIntL has Ca2+-dependent galactose binding activity, homotrimeric structure via disulfide bonds, and N-linked oligosaccharides, similarly to the native placental hIntL. The rhIntL was purified as a soluble protein from the culture supernatant of hIntL-transfected cells, but the purified and concentrated rhIntL tended to become insoluble and inactive in the presence of Ca2+ (data not shown). The rhIntL that was absorbed to galactose-Sepharose was eluted by various mono/disaccharides in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig.7 A). The absorbed rhIntL was completely eluted by 10 mm EDTA (data not shown). Approximately 50% of the absorbed rhIntL was eluted by buffers containing 100 mm galactose, 100 mm N-acetylgalactosamine, or 100 mm fructose. At the same concentration of monosaccharide, rhIntL was hardly eluted by other hexoses or derived saccharides (mannose, glucose,N-acetylmannosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, sorbose, d-fucose, l-fucose,l-rhamnose, and 2-deoxy-d-glucose). rhIntL was not eluted by cellobiose, maltose, trehalose, sucrose, or raffinose (data not shown). It has been reported that X. laeviscortical granule lectin/oocyte lectin has affinity to melibiose and lactose that contain an α- or β-galactopyranosyl residue, respectively (27Lee J.K. Buckhaults P. Wilkes C. Teilhet M. King M.L. Moremen K.W. Pierce M. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32Roberson M.M. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7520-7524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Nishihara T. Wyrick R.E. Working P.K. Chen Y.H. Hedrick J.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6013-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). hIntL is likely to be a human homologue of cortical granule lectin/oocyte lectin because hIntL showed a high degree of homology to X. laevis cortical granule lectin (Fig. 3). Thus, rhIntL was expected to have affinity to melibiose and lactose. However, rhIntL was not eluted from galactose-Sepharose by melibiose or lactose. Surprisingly, rhIntL was effectively eluted byd-pentoses. d-Xylose, d-ribose, and 2-deoxy-d-ribose completely eluted the absorbed rhIntL, andd-lyxose eluted 50% of the rhIntL.d-/l-Arabinose and l-xylose eluted <20% of the rhIntL. hIntL had affinity to galactose, but not melibiose or lactose, which contain a galactopyranosyl residue. These results suggested that hIntL recognized furanosides more effectively than pyranosides. Moreover, the high affinities of hIntL to pentoses supported this suggestion, since pentoses more effectively form furanoside rings than hexoses in the aqueous phase. As shown in Fig. 7 B, rhIntL absorbed to galactose-Sepharose was completely eluted by 100 mm GalfG containing a fixed galactofuranosyl residue, similarly to EDTA ord-ribose. On the other hand, <30% of the absorbed rhIntL was eluted by 100 mm2-acetamido-2-deoxy-4-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-d-glucopyranose, the galactopyranoside isomer of GalfG, and rhIntL was hardly eluted by lactose or melibiose each containing a fixed galactopyranosyl residue. These results suggested that hIntL is a Ca2+-dependent lectin that has affinity to furanosides such as the galactofuranosyl residue. Bacterial carbohydrate chains such as arabinogalactan of cell wall ofMycobacterium or Nocardia contain galactofuranosyl residues (24Daffe M. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 383-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We investigated whether hIntL bound to the arabinogalactan purified from N. rubra. As shown in Fig.8, rhIntL bound to the arabinogalactan ofN. rubra covalently fixed on the plate. The binding was completely inhibited by EDTA, d-ribose,d-galactose, and d-arabinose, but notd-glucose. Table I lists the saccharides tested as inhibitors of rhIntL binding to arabinogalactan and the concentration of each required to give 50% inhibition of binding. Pentoses (d-ribose, d-xylose,d-lyxose, and d-arabinose) andd-galactose inhibited the binding of rhIntL to arabinogalactan more effectively than hexoses (d-mannose and d-glucose). Moreover, GalfG containing a galactofuranosyl residue efficiently inhibited the binding of rhIntL, but not lactose or melibiose each containing a galactopyranosyl residue. These results suggested that the natural ligands of hIntL are bacterial carbohydrate chains such as arabinogalactan of N. rubra, and that hIntL recognizes the furanosyl residues contained in these oligosaccharides in a Ca2+-dependent manner.Table ISaccharide concentrations for 50% inhibition of binding of rhIntL to arabinogalactan of N. rubraSaccharideConcentration for 50% inhibitionmmd-Ribose<5GalfG9d-Xylose17d-Lyxose55d-Galactose66d-Arabinose70d-Mannose105d-Glucose>200Lactose>200Melibiose>20080% culture supernatants of hIntL-transfected cells containing various concentrations of saccharides were added to the plate binding arabinogalactan of N. rubra, and the amount of rhIntL was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each saccharide was used at the concentrations of 5–200 mm. The inhibition curves were obtained from the mean of duplicate determinations, and the saccharide concentrations for 50% inhibition of rhIntL binding were calculated from these results. This experiment was repeated twice with similar results.

This experiment was repeated twice with similar results. In host defense, the recognition of specific structures of pathogens is important for induction of immune responses. Some animal lectins induce responses of the innate immune system by recognition of the carbohydrate chains that host cells lack. In this study, we demonstrated that hIntL is a new type of lectin that recognizes galactofuranosyl residues, which hardly exist in mammals. This is the first report of an animal lectin recognizing galactofuranose. Galactofuranose is contained in the carbohydrate chains of various microorganisms (24Daffe M. McNeil M. Brennan P.J.

Res. 1993; 249: 383-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we found that galactose effectively inhibited phagocytosis of the cell wall skeleton of Mycobacterium bovis by dendritic cells, but not mannose orN-acetylglucosamine. 2S. Tsuji, J. Uehori, M. Matsumoto, and T. Seya, unpublished data. This result allowed us to presume existence of a receptor or an opsonin that recognizes galactofuranosyl residues. hIntL is different from the lectins that induced phagocytosis of the cell wall skeleton of M. bovis because the results of saccharide affinity of hIntL were not similar to the results of phagocytosis inhibition. However, hIntL bound to the arabinogalactan that was purified as a pathogen constituent fromN. rubra. Thus, hIntL would bind to various pathogens containing galactofuranosyl residues such as Nocardia,Mycobacteria (24Daffe M. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 383-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), Streptococcus (34Abeygunawardana C. Bush C.A. Cisar J.O.

Chem. 1990; 265: 7385-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The soluble biological defense lectins, MBL and ficolin/P35, function as agglutinins. The agglutination activity of lectin is important to lock the targets into a point. hIntL also forms a polyvalent structure that is indispensable for agglutination. Thus, hIntL was suggested to be able to agglutinate the ligands. However, rhIntL did not exert agglutination activities toward some bacteria or erythrocytes (data not shown). This may have been due to requirement of non-covalent multimer structures larger than a trimer unit for agglutination. It has been reported that the native X. laevis cortical granule lectin/oocyte lectin, a homologue of hIntL, exists as multimers of approximately 500 kDa and agglutinated trypsinized and glutaraldehyde-fixed rabbit erythrocytes (32Roberson M.M. Barondes S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7520-7524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or natural ligands (33Nishihara T. Wyrick R.E. Working P.K. Chen Y.H. Hedrick J.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6013-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, hIntL may exhibit agglutination activity with its natural ligands only when it forms the native multimer structure. MBL and ficolin/P35 also function as opsonins and complement activating factors (4Kuhlman M. Joiner K. Ezekowitz R.A.B. J. Exp.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Although these activities are sustained by the collagen-like domains of these molecules (3Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 9Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), hIntL has no collagen-like domain. This suggested that hIntL does not function as an opsonin via C1q receptor and/or a complement activating factor forming complexes with MBL-associated serine proteases. However, it has been reported that ascidian galactose-specific plasma lectin, an ascidian homologue of hIntL, enhanced phagocytosis of its target, sheep erythrocytes (28Abe Y. Tokuda M. Ishimoto R. Azumi K. Yokosawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, hIntL may be able to function as an opsonin via an unknown receptor. hIntL is a Ca2+-dependent galactose-binding lectin, but there is no carbohydrate recognition domain, which is a characteristic of C-type lectins. In mammals, the galactose-binding C-type lectins, a macrophage lectin or asialoglycoprotein receptors, bind to asialoglycoproteins (16Suzuki N. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 128-135PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ozaki K. Ii M. Itoh N. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9229-9235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the binding affinity of hIntL to asialoglycoproteins was weak (data not shown). This was thought to be because the galactosyl residues of asialoglycoproteins are galactopyranosides although hIntL has affinity to the galactofuranosyl residue. As the X. laevis oocyte lectin, a homologue of hIntL, has been shown to participate in formation of the fertilization envelope that blocks sperm entry (38Quill T.A. Hedrick J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Gerton G.L. Hedrick J.L. Dev. Biol. 1986; 116: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), hIntL may also participate in fertilization. However, hIntL was also expressed on various tissues other than oocytes, and it has been reported that the other homologues are also present in various tissues (26Komiya T. Tanigawa Y. Hirohashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Abe Y. Tokuda M. Ishimoto R. Azumi K. Yokosawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 40Roberson M.M. Barondes S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, hIntL and its homologues may not only participate in formation of the fertilization envelope but also have other physiological functions. The result of Northern blotting analysis suggested that hIntL was plentifully expressed in the heart (Fig. 5). It is known that viridans streptococci invading into blood attack heart and cause subacute infectious endocarditis, and the cell surface polysaccharide ofStreptococcus oralis, a viridans streptococci, contains galactofuranosyl residues (34Abeygunawardana C. Bush C.A. Cisar J.O. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8568-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, hIntL may function in heart as a defense protein against these pathogens. It is also possible that hIntL may be an acceptor molecule of viridans streptococci in heart. These possibilities could be tested using galactofuranoside-modifiedStreptococcus. Mouse intelectin was reported as the first intelectin homologue in mammals, and the gene was specifically expressed in intestinal paneth cells (26Komiya T. Tanigawa Y. Hirohashi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical and physiological functions were not analyzed in the study because the recombinant mouse intelectin produced in Escherichia coli had toxic activity in bacteria. Although the ascidian galactose-specific plasma lectin, an ascidian homologue of hIntL, was reported as a lectin that bound to galactose and enhanced the phagocytosis of sheep erythrocytes (28Abe Y. Tokuda M. Ishimoto R. Azumi K. Yokosawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it has not been clarified whether the lectin bound to constituents of pathogens. In the present study, we demonstrated that hIntL has affinity to galactofuranosyl residues and recognizes bacterial carbohydrate chains. The galactofuranosyl residue is a constituent of pathogens and a dominant immunogen (24Daffe M. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 383-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 41Notermans S. Veeneman G.H. van Zuylen C.W. Hoogerhout P. van Boom J.H. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggested that a biological function of hIntL is the specific recognition of pathogens and bacterial components containing galactofuranosyl residues. We are grateful to Drs. H. Koyama, M. Tatsuta and T. Masaoka (Osaka Medical Center) for support of this work. Thanks are also due to Dr. I. Azuma (Hakodate National College of Technology) and A.

https://openalex.org/W2017877447,"The Nuclear Factor (NF)-kappaB family of transcription factors controls expression of genes which promote cell growth, survival, and neoplastic transformation. Recently we demonstrated aberrant constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in primary human and rat breast cancer specimens and in cell lines. Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family member Her-2/neu, seen in approximately 30% of breast cancers, is associated with poor prognosis. Previously, Her-2/neu has been shown to signal via a phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase to Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway. Since this signaling pathway was recently shown to activate NF-kappaB, here we have tested the hypothesis that Her-2/neu can activate NF-kappaB in breast cancer. Overexpression of Her-2/neu and EGFR-4 in Ba/F3 cells led to constitutive PI3- and Akt kinase activities, and induction of classical NF-kappaB (p50/p65). Similarly, a tumor cell line and tumors derived from MMTV-Her-2/neu transgenic mice displayed elevated levels of classical NF-kappaB. Engagement of Her-2/neu receptor downregulated the level of NF-kappaB. NF-kappaB binding and activity in the cultured cells was reduced upon inhibition of the PI3- to Akt kinase signaling pathway via ectopic expression of kinase inactive mutants, incubation with wortmannin, or expression of the tumor suppressor phosphatase PTEN. Inhibitors of calpain, but not the proteasome, blocked IkappaB-alpha degradation. Inhibition of Akt did not affect IKK activity. These results indicate that Her-2/neu activates NF-kappaB via a PI3- to Akt kinase signaling pathway that can be inhibited via the tumor suppressor PTEN, and is mediated by calpain rather than the IkappaB kinase complex."

Pro-lysyl oxidase is processed by procollagen C-proteinase activity, which also removes the C-propeptides of procollagens I–III. The Bmp1 gene encodes two procollagen C-proteinases: bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1) and mammalian Tolloid (mTLD). Mammalian Tolloid-like (mTLL)-1 and -2 are two genetically distinct BMP-1-related proteinases, and mTLL-1 has been shown to have procollagen C-proteinase activity. The present study is the first to directly compare pro-lysyl oxidase processing by these four related proteinases. In vitro assays with purified recombinant enzymes show that all four proteinases productively cleave pro-lysyl oxidase at the correct physiological site but that BMP-1 is 3-, 15-, and 20-fold more efficient than mTLL-1, mTLL-2, and mTLD, respectively. To more directly assess the roles of BMP-1 and mTLL-1 in lysyl oxidase activation by connective tissue cells, fibroblasts cultured from Bmp1-null,Tll1-null, and Bmp1/Tll1 double null mouse embryos, thus lacking BMP-1/mTLD, mTLL-1, or all three enzymes, respectively, were assayed for lysyl oxidase enzyme activity and for accumulation of pro-lysyl oxidase and mature ∼30-kDa lysyl oxidase. Wild type cells or cells singly null for Bmp1 orTll1 all produced both pro-lysyl oxidase and processed lysyl oxidase at similar levels, indicating apparently normal levels of processing, consistent with enzyme activity data. In contrast, double null Bmp1/Tll1 cells produced predominantly unprocessed 50-kDa pro-lysyl oxidase and had lysyl oxidase enzyme activity diminished by 70% compared with wild type, Bmp1-null, andTll1-null cells. Thus, the combination of BMP-1/mTLD and mTLL-1 is shown to be responsible for the majority of processing leading to activation of lysyl oxidase by murine embryonic fibroblasts, whereas in vitro studies identify pro-lysyl oxidase as the first known substrate for mTLL-2.

These aldehydes then undergo nonenzymatic reactions resulting in the cross-linkages known to be critical in the formation of mature functional insoluble elastin and collagens (1Kagan H. Mecham R.P.

Connective tissue abnormalities known as osteolathyrism result fromin vivo inhibition of lysyl oxidase activity by β-aminopropionitrile feeding (3Siegel R.C. Int. Rev. Connect. Tis. Res. 1979; 8: 73-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The abnormalities include malformed and weak bones, as well as increased development of hernias (4Selye H. Rev. Can. Biol. 1957; 16: 3-82Google Scholar). Lysyl oxidase is synthesized as a 50-kDa glycoprotein and is processed extracellularly to produce the ∼30-kDa molecular form known to be active (5Trackman P.C. Bedell-Hogan D. Tang J. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8666-8671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the proteolytic processing site in pro-lysyl oxidase resembles that of the fibrillar procollagen C-terminal pro-peptide processing sites cleaved by procollagen C-proteinase (PCP)1 (6Cronshaw A.D. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Hulmes D.J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, preparations highly enriched in PCP activity have been shown to process pro-lysyl oxidase at the correct physiological site (7Panchenko M.V. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Trubetskoy O.V.

The mTLD protein product contains a longer C terminus than BMP-1, resulting in a domain structure identical to that of theDrosophila protein Tolloid. The domains in BMP-1, mTLD, andDrosophila Tolloid include the astacin-like proteinase domain and epidermal growth factor-like domains and CUB domains that may mediate binding to other extracellular proteins (12Prockop D.J. Sieron A.L. Li S.W. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13Hulmes D.J. Mould A.P. Kessler E. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Drosophila Tolloid plays an important role in pattern formation during embryogenesis by cleaving the secreted protein SOG (short gastrulation), which forms latent complexes with the transforming growth factor β-related protein DPP (decapentaplegic) (14Marques G.

BMP-1 may play a similar role in mammalian embryogenetic patterning, because it cleaves the SOG vertebrate homologue Chordin, which binds and inactivates the DPP vertebrate homologues BMP-2/BMP-4 (10Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev.

Although mammalian BMP-1 and mTLD both are PCPs, only BMP-1 hydrolyzes Chordin, indicating that Bmp1 gene products have different substrate specificities and some different biological functions (10Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The mammalian Bmp1 gene is a member of a multigene family, and two genetically distinct mammalian Tolloid-related proteinases, mammalian Tolloid-like 1 and 2 (mTLL-1 and mTLL-2), have recently been described (10Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite highly similar sequences and domain structures, the substrate specificities of BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2 differ. BMP-1, mTLD, and mTLL-1 all have readily detectable PCP activity. By contrast, mTLL-2 does not appear to process fibrillar procollagens. BMP-1 and mTLL-1 readily cleave Chordin, whereas mTLD and mTLL-2 do not cleave Chordin (10Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). BMP-1 and mTLL-1 process probiglycan, whereas mTLL-2 does not (16Scott I.C. Imamura Y. Pappano W.N.

It has yet to be determined whether differences in specificity occur with other substrates, such as pro-lysyl oxidase. Because lysyl oxidase is critical for production of mature and functional extracellular matrices, it is important to understand whether a single member of the BMP-1-related proteinases predominates in processing pro-lysyl oxidase in connective tissues and cells or whether functional redundancy for this activity exists among BMP-1-related proteins. Mice homozygous null for the Bmp1 gene have impaired ossification of calvaria and herniation of the gut and do not survive beyond birth but have grossly normal axial and appendicular skeletons (17Suzuki N. Labosky P.A. Furuta Y. Hargett L. Dunn R. Fogo A.B. Takahara K. Peters D.M. Greenspan D.S. Hogan B.L. Development. 1996; 122: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, fibroblasts from Bmp1-null embryos accumulate less insoluble collagen, and collagen fibrils are not normal in appearance. Procollagen processing is diminished, resulting in accumulation of intermediates that retain the C-propeptide and in low amounts of fully processed native collagen monomers (17Suzuki N. Labosky P.A. Furuta Y. Hargett L. Dunn R. Fogo A.B. Takahara K. Peters D.M. Greenspan D.S. Hogan B.L. Development. 1996; 122: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that in Bmp1-null embryos and fibroblasts, related proteinases are able to partially, but not fully, compensate for the loss of the PCP activity normally provided by BMP-1 and mTLD. Interestingly, the Bmp1-null phenotype that includes gut herniation and abnormalities in calvaria maturation appears similar to lathyrism (4Selye H. Rev. Can. Biol. 1957; 16: 3-82Google Scholar). As noted above, lathyrism is caused by a deficiency in lysyl oxidase enzyme activity (1Kagan H. Mecham R.P. Biology and Regulation of Extracellular Matrix: Regulation of Matrix Accumulation. 1. Academic Press, Orlando1986: 321-398Google Scholar, 3Siegel R.C. Int. Rev. Connect. Tis. Res. 1979; 8: 73-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that lysyl oxidase enzyme activity may be abnormally low in the absence of a functional Bmp1gene. Tll1-null animals have been recently created, and the homozygous null genotype is embryonic lethal (18Clark T.G. Conway S.J. Scott I.C. Labosky P.A. Winnier G. Bundy J. Hogan B.L. Greenspan D.S. Development. 1999; 126: 2631-2642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast toBmp1-null embryos, the Tll1-null embryonic phenotype has abnormalities predominantly in vascular and cardiac tissues. These differences in phenotypes, along with differences in the tissue-specific expression patterns of the differentBmp1-related genes, suggest differences in functions (18Clark T.G. Conway S.J. Scott I.C. Labosky P.A. Winnier G. Bundy J. Hogan B.L. Greenspan D.S. Development. 1999; 126: 2631-2642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the absence of more widespread defects in Bmp1-null and Tll1-null embryos suggests some functional overlap between the cognate products of the two genes. The lysyl oxidase pro-enzyme processing activities of the different BMP-1-related proteinases have not previously been compared, nor has the major enzyme responsible for processing of pro-lysyl oxidasein vivo been identified. The present study compares pro-lysyl oxidase processing in vitro by all four known mammalian BMP-1 proteinase family members (BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2). In addition, lysyl oxidase enzyme activity and pro-enzyme biosynthetic processing are determined in mouse embryo fibroblasts containing null alleles for Bmp1, for the mTLL-1 geneTll1, or for both genes. Results from in vitrostudies show that BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2 all process pro-lysyl oxidase at the correct physiological site but that the BMP-1 and mTLL-1 enzymes are the most efficient. Moreover, data from in vitroassays and from cell culture experiments support the important conclusion that the Bmp1 and Tll1 genes together provide the majority of activity for the biosynthetic processing of pro-lysyl oxidase and the generation of lysyl oxidase enzyme activity. The studies also identify pro-lysyl oxidase as the first known substrate for mTLL-2. Recombinant human BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2 were produced as C-terminal FLAG-tagged proteins in transfected 293-EBNA cells and purified by affinity chromatography using the same methodology as in Ref. 10Scott I.C.

Each enzyme exhibited a single major band on SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Blue, and purity of each enzyme preparation was estimated to be 90% or greater. The concentration of enzyme solutions was determined by subjecting serial dilutions of enzymes and known amounts of standard proteins to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (10Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The relative specific activities of enzymes against known substrates type I procollagen and Chordin were verified prior to initiating experiments with pro-lysyl oxidase (10Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The maltose-binding protein/lysyl oxidase fusion protein was produced and purified as described previously (19Feres-Filho E.J. Choi Y.J. Han X. Takala T.E.S. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30797-30803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-bovine lysyl oxidase antibodies were raised against purified 30-kDa mature bovine aorta lysyl oxidase as described (20Trackman P.C. Pratt A.M. Wolanski A. Tang S.S. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. Kagan H.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4863-4870Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and were provided by Dr. Herbert M. Kagan (Boston University School of Medicine). The antibodies were affinity purified utilizing immobilized lysyl oxidase fusion protein (19Feres-Filho E.J. Choi Y.J. Han X. Takala T.E.S. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30797-30803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of anti-lysyl oxidase was accomplished utilizing recombinant rat lysyl oxidase fusion protein covalently attached to Sulfolink (Pierce), and the specific antibodies were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. The titer of the purified lysyl oxidase antibody was determined by Western blotting against the lysyl oxidase fusion protein. Alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibodies and Western Blue detection reagents were purchased fromPromega. Although there is no obvious sequence similarity between lysyl oxidase and the maltose-binding protein, the affinity purified anti-lysyl oxidase antibody recognizes both mature 30-kDa lysyl oxidase itself and the maltose-binding protein (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) on Western blots. Thus, by chance, shared epitopes between lysyl oxidase and the maltose-binding protein appear to exist. This provides for recognition of both the lysyl oxidase portion and the maltose-binding protein portions, respectively, of the recombinant fusion protein substrate by this antibody preparation. Maltose-binding protein/lysyl oxidase fusion protein (7 μg) was incubated with 30 ng of recombinant FLAG-tagged BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, or mTLL-2 for either 45 min or 4 h at 37 °C in a final volume of 200 μl of 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.5. The reactions all contained 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to inhibit nonspecific proteinases. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Fifty-μl aliquots were subjected to 10% PAGE and Western blotting (21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the blots were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20. The blots were incubated with affinity purified anti-lysyl oxidase antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000 at room temperature overnight. The blots were washed and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase goat anti-rabbit IgG according to the manufacturer's instructions. The bands were detected using stabilized nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate Western Blue reagent (Promega). The relative amount of 86-kDa fusion protein substrate and 30-kDa lysyl oxidase product in each lane was determined by densitometry measurements performed in triplicate utilizing a Bio-Rad Fluor-S MultiImager equipped with Quantityone software (version 4.01), and the percentages of the conversions were determined. The semi-quantitative pro-lysyl oxidase conversion activity/pmol proteinase was then calculated from reactions in which conversion of 86-kDa fusion protein to 30-kDa product was 50% or less. Previous studies have shown that pro-lysyl oxidase processing activity assays analyzed as described above are linear as a function of time of incubation in reactions in which up to 50% conversion of 86-kDa fusion protein substrate to 30-kDa product is observed (19Feres-Filho E.J.

For N-terminal sequence analyses of 30-kDa products, reactions containing 7 μg of fusion protein, as described above, were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. The reactions did not contain soybean trypsin inhibitor but did contain all other proteinase inhibitors. The reactions were concentrated by lyophilization, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad Trans-Blot), and stained with Coomassie Blue. Visualized 30-kDa protein bands were excised and subjected to N-terminal analyses by Edman degradation by Bill Lane and colleagues at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA). Fibroblasts from Bmp1 +/+,Bmp1 +/−, Bmp1 −/−, Tll1 +/+,Tll1 +/−, Tll1 −/−, andBmp1/Tll1 homozygous double null (Bmp1−/− and Tll1 −/−) embryos were isolated as described (17Suzuki N. Labosky P.A.

The cells were passaged no more than seven times and were grown in 100-mm tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Lysyl oxidase enzyme activity was measured in conditioned media using a recombinant tritiated tropoelastin substrate (22Bedell-Hogan D. Trackman P. Abrams W. Rosenbloom J. Kagan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10345-10350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Media samples (0.5 ml) were assayed in quadruplicate in a final volume of 1 ml, containing 0.1 mborate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0, and 320,000 dpm of tritiated tropoelastin in the presence and absence of 5 × 10−4m β-aminopropionitrile. The reactions were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C, followed by distillation under vacuum. The level of radioactivity in tritiated water in 0.5-ml aliquots of distillate was determined by scintillation spectrometry. Units of enzyme activity are defined as dpm released above β-aminopropionitrile controls. Determinations of DNA to normalize enzyme activity measurements were performed from each cell layer (23Vytasek R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Three 100-mm tissue culture plates each of wild type, Bmp1 −/−,Tll1 −/−, and double null (Bmp1 −/−,Tll1 −/−) fibroblasts were grown to near confluence. The cells were then placed in serum-free and methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 20 min. The cultures were then refed with this same medium containing 50 μCi/ml methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer catalogue number NEG-072) and cultured for 18 h. Media proteins were recovered by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and dissolved in 2% SDS. Duplicate samples containing equivalent levels of radiolabeled media proteins from each cell culture were immunoprecipitated with anti-bovine lysyl oxidase and with preimmune serum, respectively (5Trackman P.C.

Recombinant maltose-binding protein/lysyl oxidase fusion proteins were created and used as substrate in assays to assess pro-lysyl oxidase proteolytic processing activity (7Panchenko M.V.

As shown in Fig.1, the N-terminal end of the intact fusion protein consists of the maltose-binding protein, and the C-terminal end is the rat lysyl oxidase proenzyme. Following proteolytic processing by PCP, two products are generated: 30-kDa mature lysyl oxidase and a 56-kDa maltose-binding protein/lysyl oxidase propeptide product. Immunoblotting of products utilizing anti-30-kDa lysyl oxidase antibodies allows qualitative and quantitative assessment of lysyl oxidase processing activity (19Feres-Filho E.J. Choi Y.J. Han X.

Fusion protein processing by purified recombinant BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2 was assayed. Thirty ng of each purified enzyme was incubated with 7 μg of fusion protein for 4 h at 37 °C, and products were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with lysyl oxidase polyclonal antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Incubations containing fusion protein and no added proteinase exhibited a single major 86-kDa band and sometimes an additional minor 84-kDa band when probed with the lysyl oxidase antibody (Fig.2 A, lane 1) (19Feres-Filho E.J.

No 30-kDa product was observed in the absence of added enzymes. By contrast each reaction containing a recombinant enzyme resulted in production of a 30-kDa product recognized by the lysyl oxidase antibody. Under these conditions, BMP-1 and mTLL-1 caused near complete to complete loss of 86-kDa fusion protein and production of large amounts of 30-kDa product, whereas mTLD and mTLL-2 resulted in slight loss of 86-kDa fusion protein and production of small amounts of 30-kDa product. Semi-quantitative densitometric analyses of the relative intensity of 86- and 30-kDa bands in each lane indicate 93–100% conversion by BMP-1 and mTLL-1 and 10–15% conversion by mTLD and mTLL-2, respectively. Similar results were obtained in a total of four experiments performed with two different preparations of enzymes. Semi-quantitative assessment of lysyl oxidase fusion protein conversion is linear with respect to both the time of incubation and the amount of activity if the percentage of conversion is 50% or less under the experimental conditions utilized in the present study and as previously reported (19Feres-Filho E.J.

Thus, incubations were carried out for shorter times with the goal of obtaining valid relative semi-quantitative activity estimates for all four enzymes. Incubations carried out for 45 min resulted in lower percentage conversions for all enzymes, as expected (Fig. 2 B). BMP-1 converted 50% of the maltose-binding protein/lysyl oxidase fusion protein, and mTLL-1 converted 15%. Conversion activity per hour was then calculated for each enzyme, and the results were expressed as micrograms of fusion protein converted per hour per picomole of enzyme (TableI). The values in Table I are derived from blots shown in Fig. 2 A (mTLD and mTLL-2) and Fig.2 B (BMP-1 and mTLL-1). The results clearly show that BMP-1 processes the lysyl oxidase fusion protein with the highest efficiency compared with the other enzymes. As noted above, blots from four independent experiments in which incubations were performed for 2 or 4 h all exhibited higher conversion of 86-kDa fusion protein to 30-kDa lysyl oxidase by BMP-1 compared with the other enzymes, with results similar to the blot shown in Fig. 2 A. The data in Table I are derived from assays performed in the linear responsive range of the assay, and relationships identified by these semi-quantitative assay results demonstrate that BMP-1 is the most efficient pro-lysyl oxidase processing enzyme. These results are representative of all of the experiments performed.Table IPro-lysyl oxidase processing activity by recombinant BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, and mTLL-2 enzymesEnzymePro-lysyl oxidase processing specific activityμg/h/pmolBMP-115.0 ± 3.0mTLD0.79 ± 0.10mTLL-15.38 ± 1.20mTLL-21.03 ± 0.20Seven μg of maltose binding protein/lysyl oxidase fusion protein was incubated with 30 ng of recombinant enzyme for either 45 min or 4 h at 37 °C, and aliquots were subjected to Western blotting and probed with anti-bovine lysyl oxidase (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2318160598,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) has been implicated in the regulation of cell migration. In addition, FAK expression is increased in a number of highly metastatic tumor cell lines. Therefore, we investigated the role of FAK in regulating migration of prostate carcinoma cell lines with increasing metastatic potential. We show that highly tumorigenic PC3 and DU145 cells exhibit intrinsic migratory capacity, while poorly tumorigenic LNCaP cells require a stimulus to migrate. Increased metastatic potential of PC3 and DU145 cells correlates with increased FAK expression, overall tyrosine phosphorylation and activity, as measured by autophosphorylation of tyrosine 397. However, in PC3 and DU145 cells, FAK autophosphorylation is adhesion dependent whereas a second site of tyrosine phosphorylation, tyrosine 861, a Src specific site, is uncoupled from adhesion-dependent signaling events. Finally, inhibiting the FAK/Src signal transduction pathway by over expressing FRNK (Focal adhesion kinase-Related Non-Kinase), an inhibitor of FAK activation, or treatment with PP2, a Src family kinase inhibitor, significantly inhibited migration of prostate carcinoma cell lines, demonstrating that tumor cell migration continues to be dependent on signals emanating from this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1994263058,"As growing retinotectal axons navigate from the eye to the tectum, they sense guidance molecules distributed along the optic pathway. Mutations in the zebrafish astray gene severely disrupt retinal axon guidance, causing anterior-posterior pathfinding defects, excessive midline crossing, and defasciculation of the retinal projection. Eye transplantation experiments show that astray function is required in the eye. We identify astray as zebrafish robo2, a member of the Roundabout family of axon guidance receptors. Retinal ganglion cells express robo2 as they extend axons. Thus, robo2 is required for multiple axon guidance decisions during establishment of the vertebrate visual projection."
https://openalex.org/W2044865929,"Aminoacyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases establish the rules of the genetic code by catalyzing the aminoacylation of tRNAs. For some synthetases, accuracy depends critically on an editing function at a site distinct from the aminoacylation site. Mutants of Escherichia coli that incorrectly charge tRNA Val with cysteine were selected after random mutagenesis of the whole chromosome. All mutations obtained were located in the editing site of valyl-tRNA synthetase. More than 20% of the valine in cellular proteins from such an editing mutant organism could be replaced with the noncanonical aminobutyrate, sterically similar to cysteine. Thus, the editing function may have played a central role in restricting the genetic code to 20 amino acids. Disabling this editing function offers a powerful approach for diversifying the chemical composition of proteins and for emulating evolutionary stages of ambiguous translation."
https://openalex.org/W2021770416,"On 25 October 2000, the Near Earth Asteroid Rendevous (NEAR)-Shoemaker spacecraft executed a low-altitude flyover of asteroid 433 Eros, making it possible to image the surface at a resolution of about 1 meter per pixel. The images reveal an evolved surface distinguished by an abundance of ejecta blocks, a dearth of small craters, and smooth material infilling some topographic lows. The subdued appearance of craters of different diameters and the variety of blocks and different degrees of their burial suggest that ejecta from several impact events blanketed the region imaged at closest approach and led to the building up of a substantial and complex regolith consisting of fine materials and abundant meter-sized blocks."
https://openalex.org/W1977933482,"Apoptosis can be induced by various stimuli including DNA-damaging anticancer drugs and the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. It is generally believed that the molecular events during execution of apoptosis are shared, as both anticancer drugs and staurosporine derivatives induce mitochondrial damage, cytochrome c release and the activation of the caspase-9 proteolytic cascade. In the present study we show that overexpression of a dominant-negative caspase-9 mutant abolished the activation of endogenous caspase-9, caspase-3 and the cleavage of the caspase substrate Bid in response to anticancer drug treatment. Surprisingly, however, only marginal effects were observed during staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we describe a Jurkat T-cell clone that is completely resistant towards different anticancer drugs, but remains sensitive towards staurosporine-induced apoptosis. In these cells only staurosporine, but neither anti-CD95 nor anticancer drugs were able to trigger caspase activity and the cleavage of caspase substrates. Our results therefore suggest that the mechanism of staurosporine-induced apoptosis is more complex and at least partially differs from anticancer drug-induced caspase activation. These distinct features of staurosporine may allow to bypass chemoresistance of tumor cells and may encourage further clinical trials for the use of staurosporine derivatives in antitumor therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1983546164,"The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype is a major cause of cancer treatment failure. Here the expressions of 4224 genes were analysed for association with intrinsic or acquired doxorubicin (DOX) resistance. A cluster of overexpressed genes related to DOX resistance was observed. Included in this cluster was ABCB1 the P-glycoprotein transporter protein gene and MMP1 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 1), indicative of the invasive nature of resistant cells, and the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), a potential new therapeutic target. Overexpression of genes associated with xenobiotic transformation, cell transformation, cell signalling and lymphocyte activation was also associated with DOX resistance as was estrogen receptor negativity. In all carcinoma cells, compared with HBL100 a putatively normal breast epithelial cell line, a cluster of overexpressed genes was identified which included several keratins, in particular keratins 8 and 18 which are regulated through the ras signalling pathway. Analysis of genomic amplifications and deletions revealed specific genetic alterations common to both intrinsic and acquired DOX resistance including ABCB1, PGY3 (ABCB4) and BAK. The findings shown here indicate new possibilities for the diagnosis of DOX resistance using gene expression, and potential novel therapeutic targets for pharmacological intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2018891616,"In both animal and yeast cells, signaling pathways involving small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) regulate polarized organization of the actin cytoskeleton. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Ras-like GTPase Bud1/Rsr1 and its guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP)/guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) exchange factor Bud5 are involved in the selection of a specific site for growth, thus determining cell polarity. We found that Bud5 is localized at the cell division site and the presumptive bud site. Its localization is dependent on potential cellular landmarks, such as Bud3 and Axl2/Bud10 in haploid cells and Bud8 and Bud9 in diploid cells. Bud5 also physically interacts with Axl2/Bud10, a transmembrane glycoprotein, suggesting that a receptor-like transmembrane protein recruits a GDP/GTP exchange factor to connect an intrinsic spatial signal to oriented cell growth."

P2X7receptors do not form heteromeric receptors with any of the other six P2X subunits, and it is not known what type of homomeric assemblies the P2X7 subunit makes. We constructed and purified an ectodomain protein of the rat P2X7 receptor (amino acids 60–323) and used this to generate a monoclonal antibody (Ab) with which to probe P2X7 receptors in central and peripheral immune cells. In HEK cells expressing rat P2X7receptors, the Ab increased the maximum current evoked by BzATP by 3–8-fold with a 5-fold leftward shift in EC50concentration. This Ab recognized only a non-denatured, multimeric form of the receptor on blue native-PAGE but did not recognize the denatured form on SDS-PAGE. A C-terminal polyclonal P2X7 Ab recognized both monomeric subunits on SDS-PAGE and a multimeric complex on blue native-PAGE in this heterologous expression system.

Barnard E.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). When compared with other ionotropic receptors (e.g.nicotinic), which are primarily or solely expressed in nerve and muscle, P2X receptors are unusual in their wide spread expression in both excitable and non-excitable cells (1North R.A.

There are seven P2X receptors, six of which (P2X1–6) are found in brain and peripheral neurons; additionally, mRNA for P2X1, P2X4, and the non-neuronal P2X7 receptor are prominent in many immune cells, particularly monocytes, macrophage, bone marrow, and brain microglia (1North R.A.

However, the functional sequelae of P2X7 receptor activation differ strikingly from other P2X receptors. Activation of P2X7 receptors expressed in mammalian cells, such as HEK1 or CHO cells, opens both a small cationic channel and a large (up to 900 Da) dye-permeable pore, followed within seconds by extensive membrane blebbing (4Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 5Virginio C. MacKenzie A.B. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar); similar events occur upon activation of native P2X7 receptors in some but not all immune cells expressing this receptor (6Di Virgilio F.

The mechanism(s) underlying formation of the permeabilizing pore and other downstream events such as membrane blebbing are not known but the intracellular C-terminal domain is required (4Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). Moreover, whereas each of the other P2X receptors is capable of forming heteromeric proteins with various other subunits in a specific pattern, the P2X7subunit cannot heteropolymerize with any of the other subunits (9Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6653-6659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), even with the P2X4 receptor with which it co-exists in monocytes, bone marrow, and many endothelia and epithelia (4Surprenant A.

No information yet exists on the multimeric nature of native P2X7 receptors. We have expressed and purified a protein comprising the extracellular domain of the rat P2X7 receptor and have used this protein to generate an ectodomain-specific monoclonal Ab to better probe membrane localization of native P2X7 receptors in both peripheral and brain immune cells. Our studies have revealed striking differences in P2X7 receptor assembly in cells of the peripheral immune system and the brain immune system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of P2X7 Receptor EctodomainA bacterial expression vector, designated pP2X7ecto, was constructed by ligation of a 792-base pair fragment from a polymerase chain reaction product, comprising amino acids 60–323 of rat P2X7 (GenBankTM NM019256) into vector pET32 (Novagen). The plasmid construct was verified by DNA sequencing with BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems). BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli transformed with pP2X7ecto was used for overexpression of ecto-rP2X7 protein. After overnight induction of protein expression by 1 mm IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside), the culture was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The bacterial pellet was resuspended (1:50 of the culture volume) in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100) and subjected to lysis by sonication on ice. The protein, aggregated in inclusion bodies, was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellet was extracted once with 1:5 of the resuspension buffer (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 2m urea, Triton X-100, at pH 8.0) by vigorous vortexing for 10 min. The extracted pellet was solubilized in 1:20 of 8 murea buffer (8 m urea, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol), centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The solubilized protein was purified and refolded by Ni2+-affinity chromatography followed by thrombin digestion and gel filtration chromatography by Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein concentration was determined by protein assay kits (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin used as the standard.Generation of Monoclonal Antibodies against Ecto-rP2X7 ProteinMonoclonal antibodies were generated against ecto-rP2X7 protein by Sheffield Hybridomas (University of Sheffield). Primary screening was performed by immunohistochemistry on stably transfected HEK cells and by ELISA. Ecto-P2X7Ab was purified from hybridoma supernatant on a protein G-Sepharose affinity chromatography column.Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates and Membrane FractionsFrom HEK CellsHEK cells stably transfected with rP2X7 or rP2X2 (5Virginio C. MacKenzie A.B. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) were used for these experiments. To prepare whole-cell lysates, the cells were freeze-thawed three times and sonicated. For isolation of membrane fractions, the cells were grown in T75 flasks, washed with ice-cold PBS, and harvested. After brief centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) and protease inhibitors (CompleteTM,Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the cell suspension was homogenized by a Dounce homogenizer, adjusted to 155 mm NaCl, and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 60,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet (membrane fraction) was solubilized in solubilization buffer (20 mm dodecylmaltoside in PBS containing protease inhibitor) for 3 h at 4 °C.From Native TissueAdult Wistar rats (43–45 days old) were used in all experiments. They were killed by excess CO2, brains rapidly removed, and placed in ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitor. The cerebellum and hippocampi were dissected out and 400-μm thick coronal slices were prepared using a McIlwain tissue chopper (Mickle Laboratory Engineering Co., UK). The slices of each region were collected in modified PBS, cleaned of blood vessels and meninges, and diced to smaller pieces for collection into a 1-ml Eppendorf tube containing solubilization buffer. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from peritoneal lavage of rats. Cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and washed twice in PBS; macrophages were collected by centrifugation. Bone marrow cells were separated from tibias and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Separated bone marrow cells and peritoneal macrophages were treated with 1 mmdiisopropylfluorophosphate for 1 h and throughout the remaining processing. Bone marrow cells, peritoneal macrophages, and brain tissues were extracted with solubilization buffer overnight at 4 °C. The extracts were centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000 ×g, 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to SDS-PAGE or BN-PAGE with sample buffer. Where indicated, β-mercaptoethanol was used at a concentration of 355 mm.Western Blot AnalysisBy SDS-PAGESolubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12%) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. PVDF membranes were rinsed in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and blocked with TBS buffer containing 2.5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. After washing with TTBS (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20), the PVDF membranes were incubated overnight with anti-rP2X2 polyclonal antibody (1:500), anti-rP2X7 polyclonal antibody (1:500), or ecto-rP2X7 Ab (1:5000) dissolved in antibody buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, 2.5% nonfat dry milk). After multiple washing with TTBS, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad). Membranes were washed, and immunoreactive proteins were detected with Immun-Star assay kit (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's suggestions.By Blue Native-PAGEBN-PAGE was performed as described previously (11Nicke A.

Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Solubilized membrane fractions were supplemented with BN sample buffer to a final concentration of 10% glycerol, 0.2% Coomassie Blue R-250, and 50 mm Bis-Tris adjusted with HCl to pH 7.0. For the cathode buffer, 5 mg/ml of Coomassie Blue R-250 was used in 50 mmTricine, 15 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0. Molecular weight standards (Combithek II, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were applied to two different lanes on both borders of the gel. Either linear polyacrylamide gradients from 4 to 15% or 7.5% (w/v) gels without stacking gel were performed at 4 °C and were transferred to PVDF membranes and immunoblotted with appropriate antibody. All experiments were repeated 3–7 times with similar results obtained throughout.ImmunohistochemistryRats were deeply anesthetized with halothane and perfused transaortically with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PBS. Brains were removed, postfixed for a further 3 h, and placed in 30% sucrose in PBS to allow the brains to sink. The brains were cut parasagitally at a thickness of 40 μm and collected as free-floating sections in 0.1 m Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4). Sections were rinsed, incubated in TBS containing 40% methanol, and 0.1% H2O2 for 15 min before rinsing with TBS. Following blocking of nonspecific sites with a solution containing either 5% goat serum (GS; for polyclonal antibodies) or 5% horse serum (HS; for monoclonal antibodies) in TBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h, sections were incubated for 4 days at 4 °C in the blocking solution containing primary Ab (0.15 μg/ml). Control staining was performed either in the presence of corresponding IgG given at the same concentration as primary Abs or in the absence of primary Abs. Following several rinses in TBS, sections treated with polyclonal antibodies were incubated in peroxidase goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and those treated with monoclonal antibodies were incubated in rat-absorbed peroxidase horse anti-mouse immunoglobulin at a dilution of 1:400 of TBS with either 2% GS or HS, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.25% bovine serum albumin for 4 h at room temperature. Bound peroxidase was visualized by immersion of the sections in chromogen solution for 3–5 min. A similar procedure was used for peritoneal macrophage or bone marrow cells but incubation in antibodies (20 μg/ml) was made overnight. For HEK cells, Zamboni's fixative (10–20 min) was applied, blocked in 5% goat serum in PBS with 2% Triton X-100 (30 min), and incubated with primary Ab for 2–3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed, and the appropriate secondary Ab applied for 1 h. Non-permeabilized cells were fixed with Zamboni's fixative (10 min), blocked in 5% goat serum in PBS (30 min), and incubated with primary Ab for 2 h at room temperature, rinsed, incubated with secondary Ab for 1 h. The following primary Abs were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-P2X1 (10 μg/ml); anti-P2X2 (0.6 μg/ml), anti-P2X4 (0.6 μg/ml), anti-P2X7(0.6 μg/ml), all from Alomone Labs, mouse monoclonal anti-EYMPME (2 μg/ml; from BabCO, Richmond, CA) and rat ecto-P2X7 Ab (0.12 μg/ml).ElectrophysiologyStandard whole cell recordings were carried out as described previously (4Surprenant A.

Concentration-response curves were obtained in stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing rat P2X7 by applying sequentially increasing concentrations of BzATP for 3–4 s duration at 1.5-min intervals. Concentration-response curves were obtained before and after 1- or 3-h incubation with 0.62 or 4 μg/ml ecto-P2X7 Ab at 37 °C.RESULTSPurification of Ecto-rP2X7 ProteinFig. 1 shows the sequential steps resulting in the purified ectodomain protein. The thioredoxin (Trx) fusion protein can be seen as a broad band appearing at the expected size of ∼50 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 2). The N-terminal His tag then allowed affinity purification by Ni2+-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography, resulting in a 90% pure preparation after this single step (Fig. 1, lane 3). Thrombin digestion then resulted in the two major protein bands (Trx and ecto-rP2X7) seen in Fig. 1, lane 4. Finally the thrombin-digested sample was further purified by gel filtration chromatography to remove Trx and increase purity of ecto-rP2X7. This step yielded a highly pure protein seen on the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel as the single sharp band at the expected size of 31 kDa (Fig. 1, lane 5). This protein was then used to generate the ecto-rP2X7 monoclonal Ab used in the present study.Cloned P2X7 Receptors Expressed in HEK CellsImmunohistochemistryWhen the ecto-P2X7 Ab was used, intense membrane-localized immunoflurescence was observed in rP2X7-expressing HEK cells with no immunofluorescence being detected in HEK cells expressing any other rat or human P2X receptor, in particular the human P2X7receptor (Fig. 2 A). We were also unable to detect immunofluorescence in HEK cells expressing the human P2X7 receptor with the polyclonal C-terminal P2X7 receptor Ab although functional expression of this receptor was confirmed by electrophysiological recordings (data not shown). The ecto-Ab-induced immunofluorescence of the rat P2X7 receptor was equally intense in permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells, whereas the C-terminal directed P2X7 receptor Ab effectively stained only permeabilized cells (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Immunohistochemical and functional characterization of ecto-P2X7 Ab. A,photomicrographs of HEK cells stably expressing the indicated P2X receptors and immunostained with ecto-P2X7 Ab; only rP2X7-expressing cells are immunopositive. Note no staining of HEK cells expressing hP2X7. B, immunostaining of rP2X7-expressing HEK cells under permeabilized or non-permeabilized conditions as indicated.

Ecto-P2X7 Ab increased maximum current by 3.5-fold; numbers in parentheses are numbers of cells examined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ElectrophysiologyTo determine whether the ecto-P2X7 Ab altered functional properties of this receptor, we recorded membrane currents in response to the ATP analogue, BzATP, from cells incubated with a negative Ab sample, with the C-terminal P2X7 Ab or with the ecto-P2X7Ab. Responses recorded from cells incubated with either the negative serum sample or the polyclonal P2X7 Ab were not different from responses recorded from control P2X7-expresssing HEK cells (n = 4 for each). However, incubation with ecto-P2X7 Ab for 30 or 60 min greatly increased the maximum current amplitude evoked by BzATP and shifted the EC50value by ∼5-fold to the left (Fig. 2 C). Longer incubation times (up to 3 h) produced no further enhancement of BzATP-evoked currents (n = 3). Thus, whereas the ecto-Ab does not block access of the agonist to its binding site, these results show that a functional Ab receptor interaction clearly occurs in the form of an enhancement of the membrane current and an apparent increase in agonist affinity. Increases in agonist affinity at the P2X7receptor have previously been observed following several different types of manipulations; for example, decreases in extracellular sodium or chloride or previous exposure to ATP all shift the agonist concentration-response curve significantly to the left (17Michel A.D. Chessell I.P. Humphrey P.P. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 359: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Gu B.J Zhang W.Y Bendall L.J. Chessell I.P. Buell G. Wiley J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1189-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Western Blotting on SDS-PAGE or BN-PAGEWe next asked whether we could obtain any insight into the multimeric nature of the heterologously expressed P2X7 receptor by comparing the actions of the ecto-P2X7 Ab and the C-terminal P2X7 Ab in Western blots using both denatured and non-denatured conditions on SDS and BN-PAGE gels. We also used HEK cells expressing rat P2X2 receptors and a C-terminal P2X2 polyclonal Ab as a control. The three antibodies were all highly specific for their respective proteins (Fig.3). The P2X2 Ab, which we used as a control for specificity, labeled two bands from P2X2-transfected HEK cells, at 68 and 52 kDa (Fig.3 A); these results are the same as previously observed for glycosylated and non-glycosylated P2X2 receptors expressed in either HEK cells or oocytes (19Torres G.E.

On SDS-PAGE, the C-terminal P2X7 Ab recognized the denatured, monomeric 79 kDa P2X7 receptor; on BN-PAGE, it labeled an ∼400 kDa non-denatured multimeric form (Fig. 3, A and B,middle panels). However, the ecto-P2X7 Ab did not recognize the denatured P2X7 receptor on SDS-PAGE, but strongly bound to the ∼400 kDa non-denatured form on BN-PAGE (Fig. 3,A and B, right panels). The ecto-P2X7Ab also detected a minor band at 240 kDa, which was not seen by the C-terminal polyclonal P2X7 Ab (Fig. 3 B,middle and right panels). In agreement with our results with immunohistochemistry, neither the C-terminal polyclonal P2X7 Ab nor the ecto-P2X7 Ab detected the human P2X7 receptor on SDS-PAGE or on BN-PAGE (data not shown).Figure 3Ecto-P2X7 Ab recognizes only non-denatured receptor.

We examined extracts under non-denatured conditions, strongly denatured (boiling plus β-mercaptoethanol) or mildly denatured (β-mercaptoethanol only) to investigate whether similar or different association patterns were observed.ImmunohistochemistryIntense immunostaining was observed in large, CD11-positive peritoneal macrophage using either the ecto-P2X7 Ab or the C-terminal polyclonal P2X7Ab (Fig. 4 A). The C-terminal P2X7 Ab produced distinct immunostaining in non-neuronal microglia/astrocyte-like cells in the hippocampus as well as the cerebellum (Fig. 4 B). However, no staining of any brain region was observed with the ecto-P2X7 Ab although several different fixation and staining protocols were employed (Fig.4 B).Figure 4Differential immunohistochemical localization of P2X7 receptors in rat peritoneal macrophage and cerebellum. A, large peritoneal macrophage are stained similarly by the C-terminal P2X7 Ab (left) and the ecto-P2X7 Ab (right). Insets show background staining with secondary Ab only. These large cells were also CD11 positive (not shown). B, cerebellar astrocyte/glia-like cells are immunopositive when C-terminal P2X7 Ab is used (left), but no staining is observed in cerebellum with the ecto-P2X7 Ab (right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Denatured Extracts on SDS-PAGEThe C-terminal P2X7 Ab detected two bands, at 67 kDa and 79 kDa, from hippocampal and cerebellar extracts; these bands were observed from extracts treated either by strong denaturation (Fig.5 A, left panel) or mild denaturation (Fig. 5 B, left panel). The smaller 67-kDa band is consistent with the non-glycosylated form of the P2X7 receptor (12Buttner, C., Sadtler, A., Aschrafi, A., Markwardt, F., and Schmalzing, G. (2000) Purines 2000 International Symposium on Nucleosides and Nucleotides, Madrid (Abstr. 40).Google Scholar) and was also occasionally observed in HEK cells expressing rat P2X7 receptors. When peritoneal macrophage or bone marrow were strongly denatured, the C-terminal P2X7 Ab detected the 79 kDa band with no evidence of the smaller band (Fig. 5 A, left panel); a similar labeling was observed for peritoneal macrophage under mild denaturation (Fig. 5 B, left panel). However, it labeled an ∼180-kDa band from bone marrow cells under mild treatment with β-mercaptoethanol only (Fig. 5 B, left panel). The ecto-P2X7 Ab did not label any of the strongly denatured extracts on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 A, right panel). Similar to the C-terminal Ab, it also detected the 180-kDa band from bone marrow on SDS-PAGE when only β-mercaptoethanol was used but detected nothing from peritoneal macrophage or brain (Fig.5 B, right panel).Figure 5Differential assembly of P2X7receptors in brain and periphery indicated by Western blot analysis. Left-hand panels show immunoblotting with C-terminal P2X7 Ab, right-hand panels with ecto-P2X7 Ab. A, strongly denatured samples from P2X7-transfected HEK cells, peritoneal macrophage, bone marrow, hippocampus, or cerebellum, as indicated run on SDS-PAGE.B, samples treated with β-mercaptoethanol to break exposed disulfides run on SDS-PAGE. C, non-denatured samples run on BN-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Non-denatured Extracts on BN-PAGEUnder non-denaturing conditions on BN-PAGE, the C-terminal Ab detected an ∼400-kDa band from both peritoneal macrophage and bone marrow but detected only a 79-kDa band from hippocampus and cerebellar extracts (Fig.5 C, left panel). The ecto-P2X7 Ab detected a ∼400-kDa band from both peritoneal macrophage and bone marrow, but labeled nothing from brain extracts (Fig. 5 C,right panel).DISCUSSIONThe important conclusion from this study is that native P2X7 receptors appear to exist as a strongly bound multimeric complex in peripheral bone marrow and peritoneal macrophage but only as monomeric forms in brain glia-astrocyte cells. Our interpretation rests on our results from immunoblotting of denatured and non-denatured extracts, comparing the actions of a C-terminal polyclonal anti-P2X7 Ab and a monoclonal ectodomain anti-P2X7 Ab on cloned P2X7 receptors expressed in HEK cells and on native P2X7 receptors in the brain and periphery. Differential immunostaining of brain slices and peritoneal macrophage also provided indirect support for our interpretation.We examined in some detail the specificity of the Abs used in our study by immunofluorescence and by Western blotting on HEK cell lines expressing the range of other P2X receptors as well as untransf"

Telomerase reverse transcriptase is the subunit of this complex responsible for the enzymatic activity of telomerase. Expression of the reverse transcriptase is regulated at the level of transcription through the action of transcription factors that target its promoter. Most Kaposi's sarcoma tumor cells are latently infected with the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and the constitutive expression of a viral-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen has been shown to be important for the maintenance of the viral episome. The proliferative nature of Kaposi's sarcoma suggests that this antigen may also play a critical role in viral-mediated oncogenesis. In this study telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter elements cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid were analyzed to determine the ability of the latency-associated nuclear antigen to regulate transcription. The latency-associated nuclear antigen transactivated the full-length promoter in 293T, 293, and BJAB cell lines. Furthermore, truncation promoter studies implicated sequence from −130 to +5 in viral-mediated activation. This region contains five Sp1 transcription factor-binding sites. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that the latency-associated nuclear antigen targets and affects the Sp1-DNA complex in the context of BJAB nuclear extracts.

Telomeres have an average length of 5–15 kilobases and function to prevent chromosome degradation, end-to-end chromosome fusions, and chromosome loss (2Greider C.W. Annu. Rev.

Additionally, telomeres can induce cellular senescence when they are critically shortened (4Chiu C.P. Harley C.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 214: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 5Autexier C. Greider C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The telomeres of most human somatic cells shorten with each cycle of chromosome replication because DNA polymerase is unable to completely replicate the lagging strand (6Watson J.D. Nature. 1972; 239: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex that functions to stabilize telomere length via the addition of new repeat sequence (2Greider C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 337-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Telomerase is active in cells with high regenerative capacity such as lymphocytes, hematopoietic progenitor cells, keratinocytes, and uterine endometrial cells (7Hiyama K. Hirai Y. Kyoizumi S.

Moreover, telomerase is typically active in tumor-derived cell lines as well as in malignant tissues (10Meyerson M. Counter C.M. Eaton E.N. Ellisen L.W. Steiner P. Caddle S.D. Ziaugra L.

Bacchetti S. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 787-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2418) Google Scholar). The activation of telomerase is a common and perhaps necessary step as cells move beyond replicative crisis to immortality associated with cancer cells (11Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar). Three subunits of telomerase have been identified. Two components are expressed in virtually all human cells with no correlation to telomerase activity. The first is an RNA component, hTR, that provides the template from which additional repeat sequence is constructed (13Blasco M.A. Funk W. Villeponteau B. Greider C.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1267-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 14Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S.S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A. Chiu C.P. Adams R.R. Chang E. Allsopp R.C., Yu, J. Le S.

The second is an integral protein component, TP1, the human homologue of the Tetrahymena telomerase P80 gene (15Harrington L. McPhail T. Mar V. Zhou W. Oulton R. Bass M.B. Arruda I. Robinson M.O. Science. 1997; 275: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 16Nakayama J. Saito M. Nakamura H. Matsuura A. Ishikawa F.

Neither is down-regulated during cellular differentiation when decreases in telomerase activity are observed (15Harrington L. McPhail T. Mar V. Zhou W. Oulton R. Bass M.B. Arruda I. Robinson M.O.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 645-650PubMed Google Scholar). The third component, hTERT,1 is responsible for the enzymatic activity of telomerase (20Weinrich S.L. Pruzan R. Ma L. Ouellette M. Tesmer V.M. Holt S.E. Bodnar A.G. Lichtsteiner S. Kim N.W. Trager J.B. Taylor R.D. Carlos R. Andrews W.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Harley C.B. Morin G.B. Nat.

In contrast to hTR and TP1, the expression of hTERT correlates with telomerase activity, and hTERT mRNA is down-regulated during cell differentiation and up-regulated during cell immortalization (9Kyo S. Takakura M. Kohama T. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 610-614PubMed Google Scholar, 10Meyerson M. Counter C.M. Eaton E.N. Ellisen L.W. Steiner P. Caddle S.D. Ziaugra L. Beijersbergen R.L.

Cancer. 1999; 80: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The expression of hTERT is likely regulated through the action of transcription factors targeting the hTERT promoter. An active hTERT promoter is observed in telomerase-positive cell lines and cancer cells, whereas the promoter is repressed in telomerase-negative cells (24Takakura M. Kyo S. Kanaya T. Hirano H.

The products of known oncogenes and tumor suppressors have been shown to activate and repress, respectively, the hTERT promoter.

Although the E6 gene product of human papillomavirus type 16 has been shown to activate telomerase by functional assays (33Klingelhutz A.J. Foster S.A. McDougall J.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), to date no tumor virus gene product has been shown to specifically activate the hTERT promoter. Prior to cases related to the AIDS epidemic of the early 1980s, KS was a relatively rare skin neoplasm typically afflicting elderly men of Mediterranean descent, immunosuppressed individuals such as transplant recipients, and young men of sub-Saharan African countries (34Tappero J.W.

The high prevalence of KS among HIV-infected homosexual men and the low prevalence among HIV-infected hemophiliacs and intravenous drug users strongly implicated transmission of an infectious agent through sexual activity (36Beral V.

KSHV, also referred to as human herpesvirus 8, was subsequently identified by polymerase chain reaction-based studies and designated a γ-herpesvirus placing it in the same family as the primate Rhadinovirus herpesvirus saimiri and the human Lymphocryptovirus Epstein-Barr virus (38Chang Y.

KSHV also targets the endothelial-derived spindle cell, which is the primary tumor cell associated with KS (42Boshoff C. Schulz T.F. Kennedy M.M. Graham A.K. Fisher C. Thomas A. McGee J.O. Weiss R.A.

Blood. 1995; 86: 2708-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Body cavity-based lymphoma-derived cell lines are the only KSHV-infected cells easily amenable to study in culture, and KSHV infection in these cell lines is predominantly latent (47Nador R.G. Cesarman E. Knowles D.M. Said J.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 943Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). More recently, human-derived microvascular endothelial cells have been shown to support latent infection with KSHV. These cells undergo morphological changes resulting in a phenotype that is similar to that seen in the formation of spindle cells in KS (48Moses A.V. Fish K.N. Ruhl R. Smith P.P. Strussenberg J.G. Zhu L. Chandran B. Nelson J.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6892-6902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, KSHV has been shown to infect a variety of cultured cells, including HEK 293, by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction detection of a spliced late mRNA (49Renne R. Blackbourn D. Whitby D. Levy J. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5182-5188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KSHV has also been detected by polymerase chain reaction in infected HEK 293 cells but not uninfected ones during serial passage (50Foreman K.E. Friborg J. Kong W.P. Woffendin C. Polverini P.J. Nickoloff B.J. Nabel G.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). LANA is a highly immunogenic protein encoded by open reading frame 73 of the KSHV genome (51Kedes D.H. Lagunoff M. Renne R. Ganem D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The 1162-amino acid LANA protein has definable domains that include an amino-terminal proline-rich region, an ∼100-amino acid acidic domain, a large glutamine-rich repetitive domain, and a leucine zipper motif (see Fig. 1; Refs. 39Russo J.J. Bohenzky R.A. Chien M.C. Chen J. Yan M. Maddalena D. Parry J.P. Peruzzi D. Edelman I.S. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dis. 1999; 180: 1466-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Additionally, LANA possesses potential nuclear localization signals and numerous phosphorylation sites recognized by several common kinases (53Lim C. Sohn H. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 54Platt G.M. Simpson G.R. Mittnacht S. Schulz T.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9789-9795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LANA is constitutively expressed during viral latency and is important for maintenance of the viral episome during chromosome replication (55Ballestas M.E. Chatis P.A. Kaye K.M. Science. 1999; 284: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 56Cotter M.A., II Robertson E.S. Virology. 1999; 264: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The proliferative nature of KS and other KSHV-associated diseases as well as structural motifs of LANA that potentially interact with a variety of cellular factors suggest a role for LANA in mediating viral oncogenesis through transcriptional regulation. Recently, it was shown that LANA antagonizes the tumor suppressor p53, thereby protecting against cell death (57Friborg Jr., J. Kong W. Hottiger M.O. Nabel G.J. Nature. 1999; 402: 889-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). LANA has also been shown to target the retinoblastoma protein regulating E2F responsive promoters (58Radkov S.A. Kellam P. Boshoff C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Here, we show that LANA likely contributes to cell immortalization by transactivation of the hTERT promoter. The preparation of pGL3B-hTERT luciferase reporter constructs and the pA3M-LANA expression construct have been described previously (25Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Afshari C. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 826-830PubMed Google Scholar, 56Cotter M.A., II Robertson E.S. Virology. 1999; 264: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The pGL3B-hTERT constructs were obtained from J. Carl Barrett. HEK 293 cells are human embryonic kidney cells transformed by adenovirus type 5 DNA; the HEK 293T cell line is an HEK 293-derived line that stably expresses the SV40 T-antigen (59Aiello L. Guilfoyle R. Huebner K. Weinmann R. Virology. 1979; 94: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). BJAB is a B cell derived from a patient with Epstein-Barr virus-negative African Burkitt's lymphoma (60Clements G.B. Klein G. Povey S. Int. J. Cancer. 1975; 16: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). BJAB and Rat-1 cell lines were obtained from Elliott Kieff. SUSM-1 cells maintain their telomeres by a telomerase-independent mechanism and are consequently negative for telomerase activity (61Nakabayashi K. Ogata T. Fujii M. Tahara H. Ide T. Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Mitsui Y. Ayusawa D. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The SUSM-1 cell line was prepared by mutagen treatment of fetal human diploid fibroblasts (62Namba M. Nishitani K. Hyodoh F. Fukushima F. Kimoto T. Int. J. Cancer. 1985; 35: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). SUSM-1 cells were provided by Masayoshi Namba. BC-3 is a KSHV-positive body cavity-based lymphoma-derived cell line obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (63Arvanitakis L. Mesri E.A. Nador R.G. Said J.W. Asch A.S. Knowles D.M. Cesarman E. Blood. 1996; 88: 2648-2654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK 293, HEK 293T, Rat-1, and SUSM-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 25 units/ml penicillin, 25 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. BJAB cells were grown in RPMI medium 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented as for Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. BC-3 cells were grown in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented as for Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium but with 20% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified environment supplemented with 5% CO2. HEK 293, HEK 293T, Rat-1, and SUSM-1 cells were collected at 70% confluency by trypsinization with trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10 million cells were resuspended, along with plasmid DNA (generally 5 μg of pGL3-Basic reporter and 10 μg of pA3M expression construct), in 400 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected by electroporation with the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II at 210 V and 975 microfarads. Transfected cells were transferred to 100-mm plates in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified environment supplemented with 5% CO2 for 20 h. BJAB cells were collected at 5 × 105 cells/ml. 10 million cells were transfected at 220 V and 975 microfarads. At 20 h, cells were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.). Luciferase activity was determined as per manufacturer's instructions using the luciferase assay system with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Briefly, 200 μl of lysates were prepared by freeze/thaw in reporter lysis buffer. The lysates were subsequently diluted 1:10 in reporter lysis buffer, and 40 μl of the dilution was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent. Luminescence was measured for 10 s by the Opticomp I luminometer (MGM Instruments, Inc.). It should be emphasized that lysates were always diluted to ensure that luciferase activity was within the linear range of the assay. The results shown represent experiments performed in triplicate. The experiments were repeated multiple times to ensure that the observed trends were reproducible. The same lysates prepared for luciferase assay were aliquoted and mixed 1:1 with 2× SDS gel-loading buffer (100 mm Tris·Cl, pH 6.8, 200 mmdithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol), placed at 95 °C for 5 min, and spun to remove cell debris. Soluble proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The fractionated protein was then transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% dry milk in PBS and was subsequently blotted with human serum, adsorbed with B cell extracts, and previously shown to be reactive to LANA (56Cotter M.A., II Robertson E.S. Virology. 1999; 264: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 64Callahan J. Pai S. Cotter M. Robertson E.S. Virology. 1999; 262: 18-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) at a 1:50 dilution followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a 1:5000 dilution. The blot was visualized by a standard chemiluminescence detection protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). BJAB cells were transfected with either pA3M or pA3M-LANA and incubated as described above. Cells were harvested and washed with PBS. Slides of transfected BJAB and nontransfected BC-3 were prepared and fixed with 1:1 acetone:methanol. The slides were incubated with 20% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature in a humidity chamber. After washing with PBS, slides were incubated with specific antibody, either human serum reactive to LANA at 1:100 dilution or Myc mouse monoclonal IgG at 1:500 dilution, for 2 h. After washing thoroughly with PBS, slides were incubated with either FITC-conjugated goat anti-human antibody or FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h. Slides were washed thoroughly with PBS, and proteins were visualized on an Olympus BX60 fluorescent microscope. The photographs were captured using an Olympus digital camera and the Esprit program version 1.2. Sp1 DNA probes were prepared by annealing complementary oligonucleotides containing the GC-rich Sp1 DNA binding site (Life Technologies, Inc. custom primers). The wild-type probe sequence was taken from −119 to −98 of the hTERT promoter (GCGCGGACCCCGCCCCGTCCCG). The mutant probe sequence wasGCGCGGACCCCGAACCGTCCCG. Probes were end-labeled with terminal transferase and [α-32P]dGTP. Sp1 mouse monoclonal IgG was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. In vitro translated LANA was made with the TNT quick-coupled in vitro translation kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Nonspecific competitor DNA was TLBR1, an unrelated 31-base pair probe. BJAB nuclear extract was prepared as previously detailed (65Robertson E.S. Lin J. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3068-3074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay reactions were performed as described previously (66Johannsen E. Koh E. Mosialos G. Tong X. Kieff E. Grossman S.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 253-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proliferative nature of cells latently infected with KSHV as well as structural domains of LANA having the potential to mediate protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions suggest a role for LANA in regulating cellular gene expression (Fig.1). Because expression of hTERT is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level, the effect of LANA on hTERT expression was investigated by testing the ability of LANA to regulate expression from luciferase reporter constructs containing the hTERT promoter in HEK 293 cells. The HEK 293 cell line has been employed in previous studies of KSHV infectivity and propagation. In one study KSHV was cytotoxic to 293 cells and was detected by polymerase chain reaction in infected cells but not uninfected ones during serial passage (50Foreman K.E. Friborg J. Kong W.P. Woffendin C. Polverini P.J. Nickoloff B.J. Nabel G.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In another study 293 cells were susceptible to KSHV infection by detection of a spliced late mRNA (49Renne R. Blackbourn D. Whitby D. Levy J. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5182-5188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data support the use of the HEK 293 cell line for preliminary examination of potential LANA effects on gene expression. The region −1665 to +5 of the hTERT promoter was cloned into the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter construct such that initiation of transcription via the hTERT promoter would drive the transcription and ultimately the translation of the luciferase gene (25Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Afshari C. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 826-830PubMed Google Scholar). This reporter, pGL3B-TRTP, was transfected into HEK 293 cells along with pA3M-LANA, a Myc-tagged LANA expression vector. Initial cotransfection of LANA expression vector with the hTERT reporter construct consistently resulted in 4.5-fold activation relative to reporter construct alone. Increasing the concentration of the LANA expression construct consistently augmented the activation to 7-fold. These data indicate that the transactivation of the hTERT promoter in the HEK 293 cell line is directly proportional to the quantity of LANA expressed as demonstrated by the observed dose-response relationship (Fig. 2). Further increasing the amounts of LANA resulted in abrogation of this activity and increased cell death (data not shown). To assess the possibility that the above response was due to either the total amount of DNA transfected or the particular cell line employed, similar assays were performed in five cell lines, HEK 293 and 293T, BJAB, Rat-1 fibroblasts, and SUSM-1 fibroblasts. HEK 293, HEK 293T, BJAB, and Rat-1 fibroblasts have significant endogenous telomerase activity. In contrast, SUSM-1 fibroblasts maintain their telomeres by a telomerase-independent mechanism and were previously shown to have little or no telomerase activity (61Nakabayashi K. Ogata T. Fujii M. Tahara H. Ide T. Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Mitsui Y. Ayusawa D. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In HEK 293T and 293 cell lines, a 15-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed when the telomerase promoter was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene. Similarly, the BJAB cell line showed a 20-fold increase in activation (Fig.3 A). It should be noted that pGL3-Basic background activity differed in these three cell lines and that fold activation of the hTERT promoter was always calculated relative to the appropriate pGL3-Basic/pA3M vector alone control. To demonstrate that expression of LANA further augments transcription at the hTERT promoter, the aforementioned cell lines were transfected with pGL3B-TRTP luciferase reporter and either LANA expression plasmid or vector control. In HEK 293T and BJAB cell lines, expression of LANA consistently resulted in an additional 1.5–2-fold activation of the hTERT promoter over background activity. Moreover, in HEK 293 cells expression of LANA resulted in 5–7-fold activation relative to background (Fig. 3 B). These data indicate that LANA can activate the hTERT promoter over endogenous hTERT promoter activity in these telomerase-positive cell lines and that this effect is not due to the total amount of DNA transfected. As discussed in more detail below, the modest activation observed in HEK 293T and BJAB cell lines was expec"
https://openalex.org/W2314472510,"Thyrotropin (TSH) stimulates survival and growth of thyroid cells via a seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor. TSH elevates the intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels activating protein kinase A (PKA). Recent evidence indicates that p21 Ras is required for TSH-induced mitogenesis, but the molecular mechanism(s) is not known. Here we report that Ras p21 activity is necessary for the Go- G1 transition in TSH induced cycle and that the downstream effector of Ras upon TSH signaling is p85-p110 PI3K. We show that PI3K inhibitors block TSH-induced DNA synthesis, cAMP-PKA stimulate the formation of the complex PI3K-p21 Ras and reduce the complex Ras-Raf1 in thyroid and other cells types. Moreover, PKA phosphorylates immunoprecipitated p85 and PKA phosphorylation of cell extracts significantly stimulates the formation of the complex PI3K-Ras. We suggest that PKA phosphorylates p85 and stabilizes the complex p110-p85, enhancing the interaction PI3K and p21 Ras. Simultaneously, cAMP inhibits Raf-1-ERK signaling by decreasing Raf1 availability to Ras. Under these circumstances PI3K signaling is favored. These results indicate that PI3K is an important mediator of Ras effects in cAMP-induced proliferation and illustrates how cAMP can selectively influence Ras effector pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2331609069,"p53 and MDM2 are both degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. MDM2 binds p53 and promotes its rapid degradation. MDM2 is an E3 ligase that activates self and p53 ubiquitylation. Moreover, MDM2 nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling contributes to p53 degradation in the cytoplasm. We have identified a new region of MDM2 which regulates the stability of both p53 and MDM2. The first 50 amino-acids of the MDM2 acidic domain (222-272) contribute to MDM2 and MDM2-mediated p53 degradation by a mechanism which is independent of either MDM2 E3-ligase activity or MDM2 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. The transcriptional coactivator p300 could have been involved, since it binds to the MDM2 acidic domain. However, we found that p300 stabilises MDM2, even in absence of an intact acidic domain, indicating that the MDM2 acidic region contributes to proteolysis independently of p300. We propose that the MDM2 acidic domain is required for unbiquitylated MDM2 and p53 to be degraded by cytoplasmic proteasomes."

One approach is to engineer plants to produce insect-specific toxins, as exemplified by the engineering of genes encoding insecticidal δ-endotoxins from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis into a variety of agricultural cultivars (3Shelton A.M. Tang J.D. Roush R.T. Metz T.D. Earle E.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A potentially more selective method is to use insect-specific viruses as vectors to deliver toxins to a restricted number of target insects without harming vertebrates and nontarget insects (4Cory J.S. Hirst M.L. Williams T. Hails R.S. Goulson D. Green B.M. Carty T.M. Possee R.D. Cayley P.J. Bishop D.H.L. Nature. 1994; 370: 138-140Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 5Bonning B.C. Hammock B.D.

Spider venoms can be viewed as preoptimized combinatorial libraries of insecticidal compounds, 1X.-H. Wang, M. Connor, D. Wilson, H. Wilson, G. M. Nicholson, R. Smith, D. Shaw, J. P. Mackay, P. F. Alewood, M. J. Christie, and G. F. King, submitted for publication. and therefore we decided to exploit these venoms in the search forinsect-specific peptide toxins. By screening the venom of the lethal Blue Mountains funnel-web spider Hadroncyhe versuta (8Miller M.K. Whyte I.M. White J. Keir P.M. Toxicon. 2000; 38: 409-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we discovered three families of novel insect-specific toxins that appear to be excellent biopesticide candidates (9Fletcher J.I.

Intriguingly, the venom of H. versuta contains at least six variants of ω-ACTX-Hv1a (10Wang X.-H. Smith R. Fletcher J.I. Wilson H. Wood C.J. Howden M.E.H. King G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These sequences, in combination with those of homologs from other funnel-web species (Fig. 1 A), reveal that one of the best conserved regions of the toxin corresponds to a β-hairpin that protrudes from the globular disulfide-rich core of the molecule. In this study, we examine the functional significance of the conserved β-hairpin using a combination of protein engineering and site-directed mutagenesis. In contrast to numerous other disulfide-rich toxins being considered for biological pest control (12Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Pelhate M. Adams M.E. Norris T.M. Zlotkin E. Gurevitz M.

This expression system enabled us to perform an alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the entire hairpin region, which revealed a small number of strictly conserved and functionally critical residues that form a contiguous patch on one face of the β-hairpin. We propose that this surface of the β-hairpin is a key site for interaction of the toxin with insect calcium channels. Insecticidal activity was tested by injecting peptides dissolved in insect saline (14Eitan M. Fowler E. Herrmann R. Duval A. Pelhate M. Zlotkin E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5941-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) into house crickets (Acheta domesticus Linnaeus, sex undetermined, mass 50–100 mg) as described previously (10Wang X.-H.

Control insects received injections of insect saline. LD50 values (i.e. the dose that is lethal to 50% of animals) were determined by fitting dose-response data with the following equation,y=a−b1+xLD50n+b(Eq. 1) where y represents the percentage of deaths in the sample population at 48 h postinjection, x is the toxin dose in pmol g–1, n is the variable slope factor, a is maximum response, and b is minimum response.

Howden M.E.H. King G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Synthetic Hairpin-less peptide (see Fig. 1 for sequence) was purchased from Auspep (Melbourne, Australia). The reduced peptide was purified to >98% homogeneity using reverse-phase HPLC (rpHPLC) and then oxidized/folded by dilution into a glutathione (GSH) redox buffer that promotes disulfide oxidation/shuffling (15Fletcher J.I. Dingley A.J. Smith R. Connor M. Christie M.J. King G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After 72 h, the folding reaction was quenched by titration to low pH, and then the reaction mixture was dialyzed against H2O using 1-kDa cut-off dialysis tubing (Membrane Filtration Products) to remove folding buffer components. The lyophilized dialysate was dissolved in H2O, and then fully oxidized Hairpinless was purified using rpHPLC on a Vydac C18 analytical column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5-µm pore size). The yield of correctly folded peptide (i.e. peptide with the native disulfide pattern as determined by comparison of NMR spectra of the peptide with that of the native toxin) was ∼50%. An NMR sample was prepared by dissolving ∼4 mg of Hairpinless peptide in 480 µl of water containing 5% (v/v) D2O, 25 µm chloramphenicol, and 100 µm d 4-TSP (sodium 3-trimethylsilyl propionate). The pH was adjusted to 4.9, and the sample was passed through a Z-Spin microcentrifuge filter (Gelman Sciences) before being transferred to a 5-mm outer diameter NMR tube. NMR spectra were recorded at 298 K using a 5-mm 1H probe on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer. The WATERGATE module was used for water suppression (16Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional DQF-COSY, NOESY (τm = 50 ms and 350 ms), and TOCSY (τm = 100 ms) spectra were acquired using the 5% D2O sample. The sample was subsequently lyophilized and reconstituted in 480 µl of 99.96% D2O (Sigma), and then the rate of amide-proton hydrogen-deuterium exchange was monitored by immediately acquiring a series of one-dimensional spectra and two-dimensional TOCSY spectra over a period of 22 h. Two-dimensional E.COSY and NOESY (τm = 350 ms) spectra were then acquired using the 100% D2O sample. Spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker). Chemical shift assignments were made using XEASY (17Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). NOESY cross-peak volumes were integrated in XEASY and converted to distance restraints (with pseudoatoms where appropriate) using the CALIBA macro within DYANA (18Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). Dihedral angle restraints were derived from3 J HNHα coupling constants measured from either high resolution one-dimensional NMR spectra or from inverse Fourier transforms of in-phase NOESY multiplets (19Szyperski T. Güntert P. Otting G. Wüthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 99: 552-560Google Scholar). Two additional φ restraints of −100 ± 80° were applied for residues (Cys19, Asp25) for which the intraresidue Hα–HN NOE was clearly weaker than that between HN and the Hα of the preceding residue (20Clubb R.T. Ferguson S.B. Walsh C.T. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2722-2761Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Six Hβ stereospecific assignments and seven χ1 restraints were obtained using ECOSY-derived3 J αβ coupling constants in combination with Hα–Hβ and HN–Hβ NOE intensities measured from the 50-ms NOESY spectrum. All three X-Pro peptide bonds were clearly identified as trans on the basis of characteristic NOEs (21Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar), and all proline Hβ protons were stereospecifically assigned on the basis of NOE intensities (22Kline A.D. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 675-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The disulfide bonding pattern was determined unequivocally from preliminary structure calculations. Eight slowly exchanging amide protons were unambiguously assigned as hydrogen bond acceptors on the basis of preliminary structure calculations; corresponding hydrogen bond (i–j) restraints of 1.7–2.3 Å and 2.7–3.3 Å were employed for the HNi–Oj and Ni–Oj distances, respectively. The torsion angle dynamics program DYANA was used to calculate 5000 structures from random starting conformations. The program was configured to automatically remove duplicate restraints and restraints that could never be violated. The best 100 structures (selected on the basis of final penalty function values) were then refined in X-PLOR (23Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar). The 20 lowest energy X-PLOR structures were used to represent the solution structure of Hairpinless. MOLMOL (24Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) was used for molecular graphics. A synthetic gene encoding ω-ACTX-Hv1a was created by annealing and ligating a series of overlapping oligonucleotides containing codons optimized for maximal expression in E. coli. First, the following pairs of oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.) were annealed. Each pair of complementary oligonucleotides was dissolved at a concentration of 10 µm in 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, and then incubated at 95 °C for 35 min, followed by a 13-h incubation starting at 92 °C and ending at 17 °C, with 3 °C drops in temperature every 30 min. Annealing was verified by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis. DsDNA from the pair 2 (Sequence 2) annealing reaction (222 µM) was then treated with 0.09 units/ml of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 100 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 70 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6. 5′-Phosphorylated dsDNA was isolated from this reaction mixture by phenol chloroform extraction/ethanol precipitation and used in a ligation reaction with nonphosphorylated dsDNA from the pair 1 (Sequence 1) annealing reaction. The ligation reaction employed T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Ligation of the annealed duplexes (by virtue of the complementary overhangs in the N2 and C1 oligonucleotides) led to production of the full-length ω-ACTX-Hv1 gene. The synthetic gene was gel-purified from the ligation reaction and amplified with the following primers using standard PCR methods: N1 primer, 5′-ATATAGGATCCAGCCCGACCTGCAT-3′; C2 primer, 3′-TTGCAACGCTAACTCTTAAGGCCGG-5′. The bases in boldface type in the N1 and C2 primers encode 5′-BamHI and 3′-EcoRI sites, respectively, for cloning purposes. The PCR-amplified synthetic gene was digested with BamHI andEcoRI and subcloned using standard methods intoBamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to give the plasmid pHWT1, in which ω-ACTX-Hv1a is encoded as an in-frame fusion to the C terminus of Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (with an intervening thrombin cleavage site). Point mutations were introduced into the ω-ACTX-Hv1a gene using either (i) mutagenic PCR (with pHWT1 as template) using the N1 primer and a modified C2 primer incorporating the desired mutation or (ii) overlap PCR (with pHWT1 as template) using a pair of complementary, 25-base primers incorporating the desired mutation in addition to the original N1 and C2 primers. E. coli cells with functional (BL21,trx +) or defective (AD494,trx –) thioredoxin reductase were transformed with pHWT1 (either in its original form or with one or more engineered point mutations) for overproduction of glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-toxin fusion protein. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to an A 600 of 0.6–0.8, and then expression of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of 150 µm IPTG. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 3–4 h after induction and lysed with a French press. The recombinant toxin was purified from the soluble cell fraction using affinity chromatography on GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by on-column thrombin cleavage as described previously (25Riley L.G. Junius F.K. Swanton M.K. Vesper N.A. Williams N.K. King G.F. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) except that phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and dithiothreitol were not present in the lysis buffer, and bovine thrombin (Sigma) was used instead of human thrombin. The recombinant toxin liberated by thrombin cleavage was eluted from the GSH-Sepharose column and dialyzed against water using 1-kDa cut-off dialysis tubing before being lyophilized and stored at −20 °C prior to the final purification step. In order to resolve correctly folded recombinant toxin from nonnative disulfide bond isomers and other contaminants, the affinity-purified toxins were further purified using rpHPLC on a Vydac C18analytical column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5-µm pore size). Affinity-purified toxins were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 using an initial linear gradient of 12.5–20% acetonitrile over 20 min. Properly folded toxins were recovered as the first major peak (retention time of 9–12 min depending on the toxin being purified); the identity of the toxin was confirmed using electrospray mass spectrometry. CD spectra were recorded at 4 °C using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter calibrated withd-(+)-camphor-10-sulfonic acid. Spectra were recorded using toxins (20 µM) dissolved in 1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, in a 0.1-cm rectangular quartz cell. Spectra consisted of five scans acquired with a scan rate of 20 nm min−1 and a response time of 4 s. A spectrum of the buffer recorded under the same conditions was subtracted from the spectrum of each of the toxins. Coordinates and experimental restraints for the ensemble of 20 Hairpinless structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB accession code 1HVW), and 1H chemical shifts have been deposited in BioMagResBank (accession number 4937). ω-ACTX-Hv1a is a member of the inhibitory cystine knot family of toxic polypeptides (9Fletcher J.I. Smith R. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Connor M. Howden M.E.H. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Norton R.S. Pallaghy P.K. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1573-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 27Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Waine C. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The three disulfide bonds form a pseudoknot, thereby providing the toxin with enhanced stability and resistance to proteases (27Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Waine C. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The cystine knot toxins essentially comprise a cystine framework onto which four loops are tethered, each bounded by half-cystines. ω-ACTX-Hv1a differs from the well known conotoxin members of this family (28Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) in that one of the loops forms an unusually long β-hairpin (residues 22–37) that is highly conserved among the ω-atracotoxin-1 family (Fig. 1 A). This hairpin is almost as structurally well ordered as the cystine knot “core”; in the ensemble of 20 deposited structures (Protein Data Bank code 1AXH) the β-hairpin (residues 22–37) and disulfide-rich core (residues 4–21) have backbone r.m.s. deviation values, relative to the mean structure, of 0.16 ± 0.05 and 0.13 ± 0.05 Å, respectively. In order to examine the overall functional significance of the β-hairpin in ω-ACTX-Hv1a, we attempted to construct a hairpinless mutant by excising the bulk of the β-hairpin without affecting the residual fold of the disulfide-rich core. Detailed analysis of the three-dimensional structure of ω-ACTX-Hv1a (Protein Data Bank code 1AXH; Ref. 9Fletcher J.I. Smith R. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Connor M. Howden M.E.H. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) revealed that the solvent-accessible tip of the hairpin interacted minimally with the disulfide core, making it probable that excision of this region would not affect the folding or stability of the core region. Thus, we reasoned that residues 24–34 of ω-ACTX-Hv1a, comprising the bulk of the hairpin, could be replaced by a Gly-Gly linker (Fig.1 B). This leaves the base of the hairpin intact, which is essential to maintain the Cys11–Cys22 and Cys17–Cys36 disulfide bonds that form part of the hydrophobic core of the toxin (9Fletcher J.I. Smith R. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Connor M. Howden M.E.H. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The Gly-Gly linker was predicted to induce formation of a β-turn at the tip of the small residual β-hairpin. We previously showed that excision of the three N-terminal residues caused a small (15-fold) but not critical reduction in biological activity (10Wang X.-H. Smith R. Fletcher J.I. Wilson H. Wood C.J. Howden M.E.H. King G.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and hence these residues were also excluded from the final construct. The designed “Hairpinless” peptide ([residues 4–23]-Gly-Gly-[residues 35–37]); see Fig. 1 A) was chemically synthesized, oxidized/folded in a glutathione redox buffer, and purified using rpHPLC, and its solution structure was determined using standard homonuclear NMR methods (21Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The structure (Fig.1 C, Table I) is well defined with a backbone r.m.s. deviation of 0.20 Å. There are no distance or dihedral angle restraint violations greater than 0.12 Å and 2°, respectively. PROCHECK analysis (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) revealed that 67% of non-Gly, non-Pro residues lie in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, with the remainder in “additionally allowed” regions.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) analysis indicated that Hairpinless contains β-turns at residues Pro3–Gln6 (type II), Tyr10–Asn13 (type IV), and Cys14–Gln17 (type I), which are topologically equivalent to β-turns Pro6–Gln9, Tyr13–Asn16, and Cys17–Gln20 previously identified in the full-length toxin (9Fletcher J.I. Smith R. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Connor M. Howden M.E.H. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As predicted, the base of the hairpin is intact, with residues Cys19–Thr20 and Arg23–Cys24 forming β-strands (blue arrows in Fig. 1 D) and the Gly21-Gly22 linker inducing formation of a classical type I′ β-turn (residues Thr20–Arg23) at the tip of the hairpin. The Hairpinless structure overlays very closely on the corresponding region (residues 3–23 and 35–37) of the structure of the full-length toxin (Fig. 1 D). This demonstrates that the Hairpinless design was successful, since this mutant faithfully reproduces the structural details of the disulfide-rich globular core of the parent toxin. Hence, the activity of the Hairpinless mutant should provide an indicator of the functional importance of the excised β-hairpin. As seen in TableII, while the native toxin has an LD50 of 269 pmol g−1 in house crickets, the Hairpinless mutant was completely inactive at all concentrations tested up to 91,500 pmol g−1, making it at least 340-fold less potent than the native toxin. Thus, we conclude that the β-hairpin is critical to the insecticidal activity of ω-ACTX-Hv1a.Table IIInsecticidal activity of ω-ACTX-Hv1a and mutants thereofToxin or mutantLD502-aMeasured in A. domesticus.Reduction2-bReduction in potency relative to native toxin calculated as LD50 mutant toxin/LD50 of recombinant “wild-type” ω-ACTX-Hv1a.pmol g−1-foldSynthetic ω-ACTX-Hv1a290 ± 152-cErrors were estimated as 5% of the LD50 or the S.E. from the curve-fitting procedure, whichever was largest.Recombinant ω-ACTX-Hv1a269 ± 131.00Hairpinless2-dNo detectable insecticidal activity at doses up to 91,500 pmol g−1.>91,500>340T23A395 ± 201.47F24A261 ± 130.97K25A417 ± 211.55E26A483 ± 241.80N27A3819 ± 19114.2N27D3239 ± 16212.0E28A494 ± 251.84N29A603 ± 302.24N31A454 ± 231.69T32A411 ± 211.53V33A370 ± 191.38K34A846 ± 423.14K34E807 ± 403.00R35A1194 ± 704.44R35E2107 ± 1057.83D37A736 ± 372.74D37K2404 ± 1278.94N27A,R35A2-eNo detectable insecticidal activity at doses up to 4740 pmol g−1.>4,740>182-a Measured in A. domesticus.2-b Reduction in potency relative to native toxin calculated as LD50 mutant toxin/LD50 of recombinant “wild-type” ω-ACTX-Hv1a.2-c Errors were estimated as 5% of the LD50 or the S.E. from the curve-fitting procedure, whichever was largest.2-d No detectable insecticidal activity at doses up to 91,500 pmol g−1.2-e No detectable insecticidal activity at doses up to 4740 pmol g−1.

The method involves forming the bare metal clusters in helium nanodroplets and then adding a molecular adsorbate (HCN) and recording the infrared spectrum associated with the C-H stretching vibration. Rotationally resolved spectra were obtained for HCN-Mg(n) (n = 1 to 4). The results suggest a qualitative change in the adsorbate-metal cluster bonding with cluster size.
https://openalex.org/W2132228000,"Iron homeostasis is tightly regulated, as cells work to conserve this essential but potentially toxic metal. The translation of many iron proteins is controlled by the binding of two cytoplasmic proteins, iron regulatory protein 1 and 2 (IRP1 and IRP2) to stem loop structures, known as iron-responsive elements (IREs), found in the untranslated regions of their mRNAs. In short, when iron is depleted, IRP1 or IRP2 bind IREs; this decreases the synthesis of proteins involved in iron storage and mitochondrial metabolism (e.g. ferritin and mitochondrial aconitase) and increases the synthesis of those involved in iron uptake (e.g. transferrin receptor). It is likely that more iron-containing proteins have IREs and that other IRPs may exist. One obvious place to search is in Complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which contains at least 6 iron-sulfur (Fe-S) subunits. Interestingly, in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, iron homeostasis is altered, and Complex I activity is diminished. These findings led us to investigate whether iron status affects the Fe-S subunits of Complex I. We found that the protein levels of the 75-kDa subunit of Complex I were modulated by levels of iron in the cell, whereas mRNA levels were minimally changed. Isolation of a clone of the 75-kDa Fe-S subunit with a more complete 5′-untranslated region sequence revealed a novel IRE-like stem loop sequence. RNA-protein gel shift assays demonstrated that a specific cytoplasmic protein bound the novel IRE and that the binding of the protein was affected by iron status. Western blot analysis and supershift assays showed that this cytosolic protein is neither IRP1 nor IRP2. In addition, ferritin IRE was able to compete for binding with this putative IRP. These results suggest that the 75-kDa Fe-S subunit of mitochondrial Complex I may be regulated by a novel IRE-IRP system.

Complexes I–IV transport electrons from NADH or succinate to oxygen and pump protons out of the mitochondria to form an electrochemical gradient that is then used by Complex V to synthesize ATP from ADP. Complex I is the first and largest protein of this chain and consists of at least 43 subunits (1Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Within these subunits are three key iron sulfur (Fe-S)1proteins. These 75-, 51-, and 24-kDa Fe-S subunits together form the structural and functional unit of the complex (2Pilkington S.J.

Moreover, in the substantia nigra compacta of IPD patients, a selective 30–40% decrease of Complex I activity has been reported (9Schapira A.H. Adv. Neurol. 1993; 60: 288-291PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, brain iron homeostasis has also been found to be markedly abnormal in IPD and MPTP-induced parkinsonism. Although is it not clear how, a number of studies have demonstrated that, in comparison to controls, iron levels are increased 35–77% in the substantia nigra of IPD patients (10Sofic E. Riederer P.

Cellular levels of iron, a potentially toxic nutrient, are regulated post-transcriptionally by mRNA-protein interactions (12Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Mol. Biol.

Iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, control the synthesis of a number of proteins involved in iron metabolism by binding a stem loop structure in the untranslated region (UTR) of their mRNAs, known as iron-responsive element (IRE) (14Casey J.L.

In contrast, transferrin receptor, which brings iron into the cell, has IREs located in its 3′-UTR. Here, IRP binding stabilizes the mRNA, increasing its half-life, which increases protein production (13Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The mRNAs of other iron-containing proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism have also been found to contain IREs in their mRNA and consequently fall under IRP regulation. These include erythroid aminolevulinic acid synthase (19Dandekar T. Stripecke R. Gray N.K. Goossen B. Constable A. Johansson H.E. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1903-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), mitochondrial aconitase (20Kim H.Y. LaVaute T. Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. J. Biol.

Thus, there are a growing number of iron-containing proteins that have IREs, and there may be additional IRPs as well. The co-occurrence of altered iron metabolism along with the decrease of Complex I activity in IPD led us to explore the possible regulation of the Fe-S subunits of Complex I via the IRE-IRP model. By using COS-7 cells, we first examined whether protein synthesis and mRNA levels of the 75-kDa Fe-S subunit were affected by iron. Because the subunit protein level decreased with iron deprivation whereas the amount of mRNA was minimally changed, we concluded that the regulation of iron of the 75-kDa subunit was most likely post-transcriptional. We then isolated a clone of the 75-kDa subunit with a more complete 5′-UTR. This newly sequenced region revealed an IRE-like stem loop structure. We then demonstrated that a specific novel cytoplasmic protein, referred hereafter as 75-BP, bound this IRE and that the binding of 75-BP was also affected by cellular iron levels. We therefore conclude that the 75-kDa Fe-S subunit of Complex I is regulated by a novel IRE-IRP system. COS-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in monolayers with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.15% NaHCO3. HeLa cells from the National Cell Culture Center (Cellex Biosciences) were grown in Joklik's minimum essential medium with 5% newborn calf serum, 2.0 g/liter NaHCO3, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were deprived of iron by treatment with 100 µm desferrioxamine (Desferal, a gift from Ciba-Geigy) or iron loaded by treatment with 20 µm hemin (Sigma) for 16–20 h, or as noted. A PCR-amplified sequence of the Complex I 75-kDa subunit cDNA (coding for amino acids 1–260 of human 75-kDa subunit) was cloned into pETa+ vector (Novagen) and transformed into BLS21 cells. The expressed protein was isolated on nickel-agarose and then purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This purified peptide was used to immunize chickens, and the anti-75-kDa subunit antibody was purified from chicken yolks. Purified antibody was stored in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.02% sodium azide. Mitochondrial and S100 cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described by Dignam et al. (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Approximately 25–40 µg of cytoplasmic or mitochondrial proteins were separated by 10% SDS-gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were then probed with the following antibodies: chicken anti-75-kDa subunit, goat anti-ferritin (Fortron Bioscience, Inc.), mouse anti-transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), rabbit anti-tubulin (a gift from Dr. Greg Gunderson), or mouse anti-Complex I 39-kDa subunit (Molecular Probes). After 1 h of incubation, the membranes were washed and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. The protein signal was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection system as directed by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was isolated from COS-7 cells with Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. Approximately 10 µg of RNA/lane were separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Pall Corp.), and fixed by baking at 80 °C for 1 h under vacuum. The blot was hybridized for 2–3 h in 5× SSC, 10% polyethylene glycol, 5% poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate), 0.2% cetylpyridinium chloride monohydrate at 65 °C. The probes were generated by labeling a PCR-amplified cDNA insert (25 ng) for either the 75-kDa subunit or ferritin with 50 µCi of [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) by random primer labeling (Prime-It II kit, Stratagene). The hybridized blots were exposed to either Kodak X-Omat film or a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImaging Screen. In order to obtain a more complete sequence of the 5′-UTR of the 75-kDa subunit mRNA, a PCR-based technique was employed to generate a 75-kDa subunit cDNA. Based on the published sequence of the 75-kDa subunit (GenBankTM accession number X61100), an oligonucleotide, complementary to the 5′-UTR (75 gene specific, Table I), was synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies). This oligonucleotide, along with one provided by the manufacturer, was used to PCR-amplify additional 5′ end sequences of the 75-kDa subunit using a commercially available fetal liver cDNA library (Marathon-Ready Human Fetal Liver cDNA, CLONTECH) as template. The products were cloned into pBluescript SK(−) and screened by hybridization using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the 5′ end of the 75-kDa subunit (75 screen, Table I). Plasmids isolated from five positive clones were sequenced according to the protocol of the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Table IObligonucleotides used in experiments The secondary structure of the more complete 75-kDa subunit 5′-UTR was predicted by using fold prediction programs, Genetic Computing Group FoldRNA program, and Dr. Michael Zucker's RNA program, hereafter referred to as mfold. The National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) computer Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project's Neural Network Promoter Prediction tool programs were also used to locate potential cap sites and additional 5′-UTR sequences. A gel shift assay was conducted to measure the interaction between binding proteins and IREs. Approximately 40 µg of protein from total cytoplasmic extract was analyzed for binding by incubation with 0.2 ng (105 cpm) of radiolabeled 75-kDa subunit and ferritin transcripts. These RNAs were transcribed in vitro according to published methods (23Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar, 24Allerson C.R. Cazzola M. Rouault T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26439-26447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP using oligonucleotides containing single-stranded IRE stem loop sequence and a double-stranded T7 promoter (75-IRE, ferritin-IRE, T7-1; Table I). A nonspecific stem loop run-off 32P-labeled transcript (pBS-Cla, Table I) was also generated from aClaI-cleaved pBluescript SK(−) vector (Stratagene) with T7 RNA polymerase. To form RNA-protein complexes, cytoplasmic extracts were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with the labeled RNA. Unprotected probe was degraded by incubation of 1 unit of RNase T1 for 10 min followed by addition of heparin (5 mg/ml) for 10 min to prevent nonspecific protein binding to the RNA probe. RNA-protein complexes were then analyzed on 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Competition binding assays were conducted by addition of varying molar excesses of specified unlabeled competitor RNA to the cytoplasmic extract 2 min prior to the addition of labeled transcript. Shifted complexes were visualized by autoradiography. The effect of iron on the 75-kDa subunit IRE-binding protein was examined through gel shift assays using protein extracts prepared from HeLa cells in which iron content had been manipulated. HeLa cell cultures from the National Cell Culture Center were either treated with 100 µmdesferrioxamine, 20 µm hemin, or left untreated overnight. Cytoplasmic extracts and gel shift assays were carried out as described above. Partial purification of 75-BP from total extract was undertaken. HeLa S100 extracts (a gift from Dr. Bruce Stillman) were applied to a Mono Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in Dignam's Buffer D (without glycerol) (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar), and bound proteins were eluted with a salt gradient (0.15 to 0.6 m KCl). The presence of 75-BP in fractions was determined by gel shift assays, and the presence of IRP1 and IRP2 was determined by comparable assays using ferritin IRE. The fractions containing 75-BP were pooled and applied to a Sephacryl 200 sizing column (Sigma), and the fractions containing the binding protein were again revealed via gel shift assays. Western blot analysis was performed on the sizing column fractions with IRP1 and IRP2 antibody (gifts from both Dr. Elizabeth Leibold and Dr. Tracey Rouault). Also, supershift assays were conducted with IRP1 and IRP2 antibody as follows. IRP1 or IRP2 antibody was added to the partially purified protein column fractions prior to addition of radiolabeled IRE probe. The supershift complexes (antibody-protein-RNA) were detected by autoradiography. The IRP1 antibody capable of producing a supershift was generously provided by Dr. Richard Eisenstein, and both IRP2 antibodies from Drs. Leibold and Rouault were functional in the supershift assay. In addition, a gel shift assay was conducted with purified IRP1 protein, also a gift from Dr. Eisenstein. One nanogram of IRP1 protein was utilized in a direct gel shift assay with 32P-labeled 75-kDa subunit IRE or ferritin IRE to determine binding to these IREs. To investigate the effect of iron on protein levels, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial extracts were prepared from COS-7 cells either untreated or treated with the iron chelator desferrioxamine (100 µm) or the iron loader hemin (20 µm). Treatment was for 6, 24, 48, and 72 h. These extracts were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the specified antibodies (Fig.1). In the mitochondrial extracts levels of the 75-kDa subunit protein decreased with continued desferrioxamine treatment and remained stable or increased with hemin treatment (Fig.1, lanes 2–5 and Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, respectively). As a control, the levels of another Complex I subunit (the non Fe-S 39-kDa subunit) were simultaneously measured. No change in its protein levels was detected nor were there any detectable changes in the level of tubulin with either desferrioxamine or hemin treatment. That tubulin levels are unchanged with desferrioxamine treatment demonstrates that the reduction seen in levels of the 75-kDa subunit is specific and not due to a general reduction of protein synthesis. Even more importantly, the fact that the non-Fe-S 39-kDa subunit of Complex I is not affected by cellular iron status clearly shows that reduction in iron is not affecting other non-iron-containing proteins found in Complex I but is indeed specific for the Fe-S 75-kDa protein. This is exactly the case for SDH protein that exists as a three protein complex, one of which contains Fe-S clusters and possesses an IRE. Only the levels of the Fe-S cluster-containing subunit changes in response to cellular iron levels, whereas the other two proteins making up the SDH are unchanged in response to cellular iron status (25Ackrell B.A. Maguire J.J. Dallman P.R. Kearney E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10053-10059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As for the positive controls, predictably, ferritin and transferrin receptor protein levels were altered with changing iron status. Ferritin protein levels decreased with desferrioxamine treatment (lanes 2–5), and transferrin receptor protein decreased with hemin treatment (lanes 6–9).Figure 6Iron regulates the binding of 75-BP.

Pietrangelo A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To determine whether the change in the protein levels of 75-kDa subunit, in response to iron status, results from transcriptional regulation, Northern blot analysis was carried out on mRNA samples extracted from cells treated with desferrioxamine or hemin or untreated. Equal amounts of RNA were loaded onto formaldehyde denaturing gels. As demonstrated previously (26Cairo G. Pietrangelo A. Biochem.

Chem. 1988; 263: 8938-8942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ferritin mRNA levels changed after iron manipulation (Fig.2, dashed arrow, comparelanes 4–6 and 7–9 with lanes 1–3). The 75-kDa subunit mRNA levels were affected to a similar degree with iron manipulation (upper solid arrow). The average mRNA levels for both ferritin and 75-kDa subunit were increased 1.5-fold with hemin treatment and decreased to 0.85-fold with desferrioxamine treatment. The small change in mRNA cannot fully account for the significant changes seen in the protein levels suggesting that, in response to iron status, a post-transcriptional mechanism controls the change in protein levels of the 75-kDa subunit as it does for ferritin, i.e. IRP1 or IRP2 binding to the IRE in its mRNA. Complex I 75-kDa subunit synthesis was shown by Western blot analysis to be regulated by iron, and 75-kDa subunit mRNA levels were minimally changed by iron status as seen by Northern blot analysis. Since these same results were found for ferritin protein synthesis and mRNA levels, we searched for an IRE sequence in the 5′-UTR. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed on a Marathon ready human fetal liver cDNA library (CLONTECH). The PCR products of the 5′-UTR of 75-kDa subunit were cloned into a T/A cloning vector, and clones that screened positive with a 32P-labeled probe (75 screen, Table I) were sequenced. The sequence of the longest cDNA provided 95 additional bases in the 5′-UTR, as compared with GenBankTM sequence, accession number X61100(Fig. 3 a). To determine the secondary structure of the extended 5′-UTR of the 75-kDa subunit protein, two computer modeling programs (GCG foldRNA andmfold program) were employed. The 5′-UTR was predicted to fold into an IRE-like stem loop/hairpin structure with a calculated initial free energy of −54.5 kcal/mol (GCG foldRNA) and an energy of −5.60 kcal/mol for the hairpin loop (mfold) (Fig.3 b). Unlike the consensus IRE, this putative 75-kDa subunit IRE contains a 5-member loop (1CAGAG5), rather than a 6-member loop, and an A bulge, instead of a C bulge, in the stem. The location of this novel IRE is 90 bases proximal to the translational start site, ATG, placing it within the range of 0–150 bases for the known functional IREs. Since an even longer 5′-UTR could contain other IREs, we sought to determine more 5′ end sequences of the 75-kDa subunit by using the genomic DNA sequence added to the human genome data base during the course of our studies (GenBankTM accession number AC007383). Four possible cap sites 5′ of the 75-kDa subunit were identified using the computer programs, BLAST and Neural Network Promoter Prediction. Three of the predicted cap sites maintained the stem loop structure, and those cap sites were determined to be 14, 283, and 384 bases proximal to the IRE stem. Based on the size of the 75-kDa subunit mRNA calculated from the Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2), the cap site is likely to be 384 bases from the start of the IRE. Gel shift analysis was used to determine if the putative 75-kDa subunit IRE could bind a cytosolic protein, by using various amounts of S100 extract incubated with 32P-labeled 75-kDa subunit IRE (75-IRE, Table I). Indeed, a cytoplasmic protein clearly bound the putative 75-kDa subunit IRE (Fig.4, lane 1). Ferritin IRE (ferritin-IRE, Table I) was also used in these gel shift experiments as a positive control to demonstrate binding to IRP1 and IRP2 (lane 6), previously shown to co-migrate with each other (32Henderson B.R. Seiser C. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27327-27334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 75-BP-75-kDa IRE complex migrated to a position lower (Fig. 4,solid arrow) than that of the IRP1-IRP2-ferritin IRE complex(es) (dashed arrow), suggesting a different protein that we refer to as 75-BP. Interestingly, when cold competitor ferritin IRE was added to the binding assay with labeled ferritin IRE, the ferritin IRE-protein complex shifted to the lower migrating form, apparently binding to the 75-BP once IRP1 and IRP2 were saturated with ferritin IRE (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8). This suggested that ferritin IRE is able to bind to 75-BP. Furthermore, although the 75-kDa IRE could not comp"

The intracellular domain of ADAM 12 has recently been shown to interact with actin cytoskeleton via α-actinin-2 (7Galliano M.F. Huet C. Frygelius J. Polgren A. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. J. Biol.

Moreover, the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM 12 contains several Src homology 3 (SH3) binding motifs, and therefore it has been anticipated to interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins. Indeed, it has been recently demonstrated that ADAM 12 binds to the SH3 domain of non-receptor protein kinase Src (15Suzuki A. Kadota N. Hara T. Nakagami Y. Izumi T. Takenawa T Sabe H. Endo T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5842-5850Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem.

Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is essential for terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle cells. Two specific and structurally unrelated inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, LY294002 and wortmannin, block myoblast exit from the cell cycle, inhibit expression of muscle specific genes, and abolish the capacity of myoblasts to form myotubes (17Kaliman P.

Expression of dominant-negative mutants of PI 3-kinase inhibits myoblast fusion and biochemical differentiation (18Jiang B.-H. Zheng J.Z. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, expression of a constitutively active form of PI 3-kinase encoded by a viral oncogene, v-p3k, strongly enhances differentiation and fusion of cultured myoblasts, suggesting that the cellular PI 3-kinase constitutes a rate-limiting step of myogenesisin vitro (18Jiang B.-H.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Finally, NF-κB and nitric-oxide synthase, identified as downstream effectors of PI 3-kinase in myoblasts, were shown to be critical for myogenic differentiation (26Kaliman P. Canicio J. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17437-17444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Based on their structures, lipid specificity, and modes of regulation, PI 3-kinases can be divided into three classes (27Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 28Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 29Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Class I enzymes are heterodimers composed of an ∼110-kDa catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit. Class I can be further divided into subclasses IA and IB, which are regulated by tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors, respectively. Each of the class IA regulatory subunits contains two SH2 domains that bind to phosphotyrosine residues in activated tyrosine kinase receptors or adaptor proteins and play critical roles in translocation of the cytosolic PI 3-kinases to the plasma membrane. In addition, two of the class IA regulatory subunits, p85α and p85β, contain a single SH3 domain. Importantly, a p85α-associated PI 3-kinase appears to be indispensable for myogenesis (18Jiang B.-H. Zheng J.Z. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14179-14183Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Kaliman P. Canicio J. Shepherd P.R. Beeton C.A. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Mol Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM 12 interacts with the SH3 domain of the p85α regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase in vitro and in vivo. By site-directed mutagenesis, we mapped the p85α-binding sites to three different regions in ADAM 12 cytoplasmic tail. Using green fluorescent protein-pleckstrin homology (GFP-PH) domain fusion protein as a probe for PI 3-kinase lipid products in the plasma membrane of intact cells, we further demonstrate that the expression of ADAM 12 in C2C12 cells leads to activation of PI 3-kinase. Therefore, interaction of the SH3 domain of p85α with the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM 12 could be a novel mechanism of activation of PI 3-kinase in myoblasts. Anti-ADAM 12 antibody has been described previously (16Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal anti-p85α antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Bacterial expression constructs encoding GST-P1–5, -P1–4, -P3–5, -P12, -P5, calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP)-tagged P1–5, and the cytoplasmic tail of integrin β1A were described previously (16Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). DNA fragments encoding the P34 region of ADAM 12 (aa 846–870) and the SH3 domain of mouse p85α (aa 1–86) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using mouse skeletal muscle cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo alto, CA) as template,Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and appropriate sets of primers. PCR products were cloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) between the BamHI and EcoRI sites for expression of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Eschrichia coli. The construction of the full-length ADAM 12 plasmid and ADAM 12-(Δ1–424), which encodes a truncated form of mouse ADAM 12 (aa 425–903) lacking the pro- and metalloprotease domains and containing an exogenous Igκ secretion signal, has been described previously (16Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To engineer a membrane-targeted ADAM 12 cytoplasmic tail, a myristoylation motif corresponding to the first 7 amino acids of mouse c-Src (ATGGGCAGCAACAAGAGCAAG) was added in-frame to the 5′-end of the DNA fragment encoding the ADAM 12 cytoplasmic tail (aa 732–903). The amplification product was cloned into the pIRESpuro vector (CLONTECH) between the NotI andClaI sites. The PH domain of mouse ARNO, comprising amino acids 262–400, was amplified using primers 5′-CTCGCTGGATCCCGAGAGGGCTGGCTCCTAAA-3′ and 5′-CTCGCTGAATTCTCAGGGTTGTTCTTGCTTCT-3′ and mouse skeletal muscle cDNA as template. The PCR product was cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) between the BglII andEcoRI sites. C2C12 and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 under humidified atmosphere. Transfection of C2C12 cells (5 × 105 cells/100-mm plate) or COS-7 cells (2 × 106 cells/100-mm plate) was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of the recombinant proteins was analyzed 38 h after transfection. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to introduce alanine substitutions for Pro825, Pro828, Pro833, Pro836, Pro884, or Pro887 of ADAM 12. Mutants were generated by annealing mutagenic primers to a double-stranded plasmid containing ADAM 12-(Δ1–424) insert. Pfx Platinum DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used during PCR to extend the appropriate mutagenic primers. PCR products were digested twice withDpnI (Promega, Madison, WI) and then transformed intoE. coli XL1 Epicurian-Blue Supercompetent cells (Stratagene). Plasmids were purified using the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The identity of all of the mutants was verified by DNA sequencing (Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa). All of the GST fusion proteins and CBP-tagged proteins were expressed as soluble forms and purified on glutathione-Sepharose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene), respectively, according to the manufacturers' instructions. Binding of CBP-P1–5 or CBP-β1A to GST-SH3 or GST was examined as described earlier (16Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To study the interaction of the endogenous p85α with ADAM 12 cytoplasmic tail, C2C12 cells were lysed with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) using 2 ml buffer/100-mm plate. The cell extract was subjected to centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20 min), and the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (50 μl/ml lysate) for 1 h. Pre-cleared cell lysate (6 ml) was applied onto columns (0.2 ml bed volume) containing GST fusion proteins (0.6 mg). The columns were washed with buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) and eluted with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm glutathione, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (buffer C). To study the interaction of ADAM 12, ADAM 12-(Δ1–424), and ADAM 12-(Δ1–424) mutants with the SH3 domain of p85α, precleared lysate from transfected COS-7 (1 ml) was applied onto columns (0.1 ml of resin) containing GST-SH3 or GST (0.2 mg). The columns were washed with buffer B and eluted with buffer C. Purified GST-SH3 was biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after dialysis against DPBS buffer, GST-SH3 was incubated at a molar ratio of 1:20 with Sulfo-NHS-biotin on ice for 3 h. The biotinylated GST-SH3 was then dialyzed against DPBS overnight and stored at 4 °C until use. Purified GST-P1–5, -P1–4, -P3–5, -P12, -P34, and -P5 proteins (1–2 μg) were resolved in 14% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was first incubated in blocking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for 1 h and then with biotinylated GST-SH3 in blocking buffer (2 μg protein/ml) for 16 h at 4 °C. The membrane was washed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% (w/v) I-Block (Tropix, Bedford, MA), followed by incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP, 1 μg/ml, Pierce). Transfected COS-7 cells were solubilized with buffer A (2 ml of buffer/100-mm plate). Cell extracts were subjected to centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20 min), and the supernatant (1 ml) was mixed with protein G-Sepharose (20 μl;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C (pre-clearing). After removal of protein G-Sepharose, the cell lysate was incubated with anti-ADAM 12 antibody (1.5 μg/ml lysate) or anti-p85α monoclonal antibody (2.5 μg/ml lysate) for 4 h at 4 °C and then with protein G-Sepharose (20 μl) for 30 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with buffer B and eluted with SDS-gel loading buffer. Eluates were analyzed in 8% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting first with anti-p85α polyclonal antibody or anti-ADAM 12 antibody and then with HRP-coupled secondary antibody. Protein samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were first washed in blocking buffer (DPBS, 3% (w/v) dry milk, and 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h and then incubated with blocking buffer supplemented with a primary antibody followed by a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescent detection (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce). The following concentrations of primary antibodies were used: polyclonal anti-ADAM 12 antibody, 0.3 μg/ml; monoclonal anti-p85α antibody, 0.25 μg/ml; polyclonal anti-p85α antibody, 1 μg/ml. C2C12 cells were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected with expression vectors. Two days after transfection, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in DPBS. After permeabilizing cells with 0.1% Triton X-100 in DPBS for 5 min, cells were incubated with anti-ADAM 12 antibody (1:500 dilution) for 1 h and then with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500 dilution) for 30 min. The coverslips were rinsed with DPBS, mounted onto slides with 20 μl of 10% (w/v) Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem) in 25% glycerol, and viewed on a Zeiss LSM410 laser scanning confocal microscope. In the experiment in which PI 3-kinase inhibitors were used, 6 h before fixation, cells were treated with growth medium containing 1 μm wortmannin or 50 μmLY294002 (Calbiochem) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Control cells were treated with Me2SO only. The minimal motifs required for binding to the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains have been determined as (R/K)XXPXXP (class I ligands, binding to SH3 domains in the N → C orientation) or PXXPX(R/K) (class II ligands, binding in the C → N orientation) (31Feng S. Chen J.K., Yu, H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 32Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Zhou X.-M. Henry P.A. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of ADAM 12 contains three class I and two class II SH3 binding motifs that are conserved between mouse and human (Fig. 1,A and B). To examine whether the SH3 binding motifs in ADAM 12 can mediate interaction with the p85α regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, we expressed and affinity-purified a fragment of mouse ADAM 12 that spans all five SH3 binding motifs, P1–5 (residues 794–903, Fig.1 B), and is fused to CBP. The SH3 domain of mouse p85α was expressed as a GST fusion protein and purified on glutathione affinity resin. As shown in Fig.2, the GST-SH3 fusion protein bound directly to CBP-P1–5 but not to a control protein composed of CBP and the cytoplasmic domain of mouse integrin β1A. Next, we investigated whether the full-length p85α protein and full-length ADAM 12 could participate in the binding. The GST-P1–5 fusion protein was immobilized on a glutathione column, and the lysate from C2C12 mouse myoblasts containing the endogenous p85α was passed through the column. As shown in Fig.3 A, p85α was retained on the GST-P1–5 but not on the GST column, demonstrating that the full-size p85α was capable of interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM 12. Similarly, the full-length ADAM 12 expressed in COS-7 cells was retained on the GST-SH3 but not on the GST column, consistent with the notion that the full-length transmembrane form of ADAM 12 bound to the SH3 domain of p85α (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, a truncated form ADAM 12, ADAM 12-(Δ1–424), lacking the N-terminal pro- and metalloprotease domains, containing an exogenous secretion signal, and corresponding to a biologically active form of ADAM 12 described previously (4Yagami-Hiromasa T. Sato T. Kurisaki T. Kamijo K. Nabeshima Y. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nature. 1995; 377: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 16Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), bound equally well to GST-SH3 protein (Fig.3 B), suggesting that the pro- and metalloprotease domains are not required for binding. Multiple forms of recombinant ADAM 12 (ranging from ∼115 to ∼120 kDa; predicted molecular mass, 95 kDa) and ADAM 12-(Δ1–424) (∼60–70 kDa; predicted molecular mass, 52 kDa) were the result of the variable extent of protein glycosylation (14Zolkiewska A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the localization of p85α-binding sites in ADAM 12, we expressed GST fusion proteins containing the following fragments of the ADAM 12 cytoplasmic domain: P1–4 (aa 794–870, spanning the first four SH3 binding motifs), P3–5 (aa 846–903, spanning SH3 binding motifs 3–5), P12 (aa 794–845, containing sites 1 and 2), P34 (aa 846–870, containing sites 3 and 4), and P5 (aa 871–903, containing site 5 only) (see Fig. 1 B). The recombinant GST fusion proteins were purified, electrophoresed, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to an overlay binding assay using purified, biotinylated GST-SH3 protein. As shown in Fig.4, GST-SH3 bound to all ADAM 12 fragments except P34, suggesting the presence of at least two different binding sites located in the P12 and P5 regions, respectively. To further determine which of the SH3 binding motifs was responsible for the interaction with p85α, we used site-directed mutagenesis to disable individual SH3-binding sites in ADAM 12. In each mutant, PXXP motifs, which constitute the core of SH3-binding sites, were replaced with sequences AXXA, leading to a full disruption of any potential interactions involving the mutated sites. Mutants M1, M2, and M5 had a single SH3-binding site disabled (1, 2, or 5, respectively). Double mutants M1M2, M1M5, and M2M5, had only one binding site that remained functional (site 5, 2, or 1, respectively). The triple mutant M1M2M5 had all three SH3-binding sites disabled. The sequences of the regions in ADAM 12 that were subjected to mutagenesis are shown in Fig.5 A. COS-7 cells were transfected with a vector encoding ADAM 12-(Δ1–424) or the same construct containing M1, M2, M5, M1M2, M1M5, M2M5, or M1M2M5 mutations, as described above. Expression of the recombinant proteins was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-ADAM 12 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the mutations did not affect the stability of the recombinant proteins or the levels of protein expression. As shown further in Fig. 5 C, the elimination of a single SH3-binding site in the M1, M2, or M5 mutants did not inhibit binding of ADAM 12-(Δ1–424) to the SH3 domain of p85α. Moreover, simultaneous mutations in any two of the three SH3-binding sites did not abolish the binding. To efficiently inhibit the interaction between ADAM 12-(Δ1–424) and the SH3 domain of p85α, it was necessary to eliminate all three SH3-binding sites. To examine whether p85α and the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM 12 interact in vivo, C2C12 cells were transfected with a vector encoding ADAM 12-(Δ1–424), ADAM 12-(Δ1–424) triple mutant M1M2M5, or a vector without insert, followed by immunoprecipitation of ADAM 12-(Δ1–424) or p85α and Western blot analysis of the co-imunoprecipitating proteins. The co-immunoprecipitation experiment employed the truncated rather than the full-length version of ADAM 12, because the truncated form, lacking the pro- and metalloprotease domains, is transported to the cell surface much more efficiently than the full-length protein (16Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Hougaard S. Loechel F. Xu X. Tajima R. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, p85α was detected in the anti-ADAM 12 immunoprecipitate obtained from ADAM 12 (Δ1–424)-transfected and not from cells transfected with ADAM 12-(Δ1–424) mutant M1M2M5 or from control cells. Reciprocally, ADAM 12-(Δ1–424) was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-p85α antibody, suggesting that the two proteins formed a complex in intact cells. Finally, we addressed the question of the effect of the interaction with ADAM 12 on PI 3-kinase activity. We reasoned that the interaction of p85α with the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM 12 could recruit PI 3-kinase to the plasma membrane, where the enzyme could get direct access to its lipid substrates. Because the occupancy of the SH3 domain of p85α with proline-rich ligands has not been reported to increase the specific activity of PI 3-kinase (27Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 28Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 29Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar), we decided to measure the activation status of PI 3-kinase by monitoring the amount of PI 3-kinase lipid products in intact cells using a GFP-PH domain fusion protein as a probe. The PH domain in the fusion protein was derived from ARNO (Arf nucleotide binding site opener) and was previously shown to bind with a high affinity to PI(3,4,5)P3, one of the major products of PI 3-kinase (30Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), and to translocate from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in insulin-stimulated adipocytes (34Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of C2C12 cells with ADAM 12-(Δ1–424) and GFP-PH resulted in the accumulation of GFP-PH at the plasma membrane in the regions of strong ADAM 12-(Δ1–424) staining (Fig.7, A–D). Similarly, GFP-PH localized to the plasma membrane in cells that have been co-transfected with myristoylated, membrane-anchored cytoplasmic domain of ADAM 12 (Fig. 7, E and F). On the contrary, GFP-PH was poorly recruited to the plasma membrane in cells that were transfected with GFP-PH only (Fig. 7, G and H) or in cells co-transfected with GFP-PH and ADAM 12-(Δ1–424) triple mutant M1M2M5, which was unable to bind to p85α (Fig. 7, I andJ). Finally, incubation of ADAM 12-(Δ1–424)- and GFP-PH-cotransfected cells with LY294002 (Fig. 7, K andL) or wortmannin (not shown), two specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, greatly diminished the amount of GFP-PH at the membrane. This indicated that the translocation of GFP-PH to the membrane was PI 3-kinase-dependent and was not a result of direct interaction between GFP-PH and ADAM 12. In this work, we have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM 12 interacts with the SH3 domain of p85α, a regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, both in vitro and in vivo. We have identified three p85α-binding sites in ADAM 12 involving PXXP motifs located at amino acids 825–828, 833–836, and 884–887. Site-directed mutagenesis established that any one of these sites is sufficient to mediate interaction with p85α in vitro. Moreover, there was very little synergy between the three sites, and the interaction with p85α of ADAM 12 containing three, two, or just one binding site intact was essentially the same. No single site seemed to be critical for the binding, as disruption of any of the three sites did not affect the interaction with p85α. ADAM 12 is the first member of the ADAM family reported to interact with PI 3-kinase. Importantly, several other members of the family contain proline-rich sequences in their cytoplasmic domains and, potentially, they may interact with SH3-containg proteins, including p85α. It has to be stressed, however, that the presence of SH3 binding motifs does not necessarily warrant productive SH3-mediated protein-protein interactions. Specifically, although ADAM 12 contains five legitimate SH3 binding motifs, only three of them (motifs 1, 2, and 5) mediated interactions with p85α, and sites 3 and 4 were nonfunctional. Similarly, we have recently demonstrated that the interaction of ADAM 12 with the SH3 domain of protein tyrosine kinase Src required binding sites 1 or 2, whereas sites 3–5 were not active (16Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase requires its translocation to the plasma membrane, where the enzyme is positioned in the proximity of its lipid substrates. The most common mechanism of the translocation to the membrane involves the interaction of SH2 domains in the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase with activated, tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptors or adaptor molecules (27Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 28Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 29Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). In addition to mediating recruitment to the membrane, interaction of SH2 domains with phosphopeptides further increases the specific activity of the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, leading to full activation of the enzyme (35Holt K.H. Olson L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 42-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It has to be stressed, however, that translocation to the plasma membrane alone is sufficient to activate PI 3-kinase, as demonstrated by targeting of the p110 catalytic subunit to the membrane by either N-terminal myristoylation or C-terminal farnesylation (37Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). These membrane-bound forms of p110 produced constitutively active PI 3-kinases and induced PI 3-kinase-dependent responses in the absence of growth factor stimulation. Transmembrane ADAM 12, by providing docking sites for the SH3 domain of p85α, could therefore play an important role in the activation of PI 3-kinase by directly recruiting it to the membrane. At the present moment, it is not clear whether other mechanisms contribute further to the activation of PI 3-kinase at the membrane. Nevertheless, because PI 3-kinase is critical for terminal differentiation of myoblasts (17Kaliman P. Viñals F. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19146-19151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 18Jiang B.-H. Zheng J.Z. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mol Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and because expression of ADAM 12 is dramatically up-regulated at the onset of myoblast differentiation (4Yagami-Hiromasa T.

https://openalex.org/W1985338955,"The TrkA NGF receptor extracellular region contains three leucine repeats flanked by cysteine clusters and two immunoglobulin-like domains that are required for specific ligand binding. Deletion of the immunoglobulin-like domains abolishes NGF binding and causes ligand independent activation of the receptor. Here we report a specific mutation that increases the binding affinity of the TrkA receptor for NGF. A change of proline 203 to alanine (P203A) in the linker region between the leucine repeats and the first Ig-like domain increased NGF binding by decreasing the ligand rate of dissociation. This mutated receptor was appropriately expressed on the cell surface and promoted ligand-independent neurite outgrowth in PC12nnr5 cells. The mutant receptor was capable of spontaneous dimerization and was constitutively phosphorylated in the absence of ligand. Moreover, expression of TrkA-P203A receptor in fibroblasts induced DNA synthesis and transformation and generated tumours in nude mice. These data suggest that domains outside of the immunoglobulin-like structure contribute to ligand binding and constitutive activation of Trk receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2315990821,"ZAC encodes a zinc finger protein with antiproliferative activity, is maternally imprinted and is a candidate for the tumor suppressor gene on 6q24. ZAC expression is frequently lost in breast and ovary tumor-derived cell lines and down-regulated in breast primary tumors. In this report, we describe ZACΔ2, an alternatively spliced variant of ZAC lacking the sequence encoding the two N-terminal zinc fingers. Messenger RNAs encoding ZAC or ZACΔ2 were equally abundant and both proteins were nuclear. ZACΔ2 displayed an improved transactivation activity and an enhanced affinity for a ZAC binding site, suggesting that the two N-terminal zinc fingers negatively regulated ZAC binding to its target DNA sequences. Both proteins were equally efficient in preventing colony formation, indicating similar overall antiproliferative activities. However, these activities resulted from a differential regulation of apoptosis vs cell cycle progression since ZACΔ2 was more efficient at induction of cell cycle arrest than ZAC, whereas it was the reverse for apoptosis induction. Hence, these data further underline that ZAC gene is critically controlled, both at the transcriptional level through imprinting and at the functional level through alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1986109500,"The mechanism of NO- and H2O2-induced tumor cytotoxicity was examined during B16 melanoma (B16M) adhesion to the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (HSE) in vitro. We used endothelial nitric-oxide synthetase gene disruption andN G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester-induced inhibition of nitric-oxide synthetase activity to study the effect of HSE-derived NO on B16M cell viability. Extracellular H2O2 was removed by exogenous catalase. H2O2 was not cytotoxic in the absence of NO. However, NO-induced tumor cytotoxicity was increased by H2O2 due to the formation of potent oxidants, likely ⋅OH and −OONO radicals, via a trace metal-dependent process. B16M cells cultured to low density (LD cells), with high GSH content, were more resistant to NO and H2O2 than B16M cells cultured to high density (HD cells; with ∼25% of the GSH content found in LD cells). Resistance of LD cells decreased using buthionine sulfoximine, a specific GSH synthesis inhibitor, whereas resistance increased in HD cells using GSH ester, which delivers free intracellular GSH. Because NO and H2O2 were particularly cytotoxic in HD cells, we investigated the enzyme activities that degrade H2O2. NO and H2O2caused an ∼75% (LD cells) and a 60% (HD cells) decrease in catalase activity without affecting the GSH peroxidase/GSH reductase system. Therefore, B16M resistance to the HSE-induced cytotoxicity appears highly dependent on GSH and GSH peroxidase, which are both required to eliminate H2O2.

Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6130-6138PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies on the organ distribution of B16 melanoma (B16M)1 cells showed that <0.1% of circulating cells survive and may promote secondary metastatic growth (2Fidler I.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1970; 46: 773-783Google Scholar). The liver is a common site for metastasis development, and it has been shown that, under experimental conditions, a high percentage of circulating cancer cells are mechanically trapped in the liver microvasculature (3Weiss L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1990; 54: 159-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Interaction of metastatic cancer cells with the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (HSE) and Kupffer cells activates local release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can promote cancer cell adhesion, invasion, and proliferation (4Li L. Nicolson G.L. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 245-254PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bayón L.G. Izquierdo M.A. Sirovich I. Van Rooijen N. Beelen R.H.J. Meijer S.

Hepatology. 1997; 25: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Indeed, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) induce binding of very late antigen-4-expressing mouse B16M cells by up-regulating vascular adhesion molecule-1 on endothelial cells (6Anasagasti M.J. Alvarez A. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Vidal- Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Rice G.E. Gimbrone M.A. Bevilacqua M.P. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 133: 204-210PubMed Google Scholar) and thereby facilitate metastatic growth (8Giavazzi R. Garofalo A. Bani M.R. Abbate M. Gheezzi P. Boraschi D. Mantovani A. Dejana E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4771-4775PubMed Google Scholar, 9Orosz P. Echtenacher B. Falk W. Ruschoff J. Weber D. Mannel D.N. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1391-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, endothelial cells also release harmful reactive oxygen species in response to endotoxins and cytokines or in response to cancer cell contact (10Matsubara T. Ziff M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3295-3298PubMed Google Scholar, 11McCloskey T.W. Todaro J.A. Laskin D.L. Hepatology. 1992; 16: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Anasagasti M.J. Alvarez A. Avivi C. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, at low micromolar levels, these reactive species appear to act as intra- and intercellular messengers capable of promoting growth responses (13Burdon R.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 775-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). In fact, vascular adhesion molecule-1 gene transcription and expression in vascular endothelial cells are coupled to an oxidative stress-dependent mechanism (14Marui N. Offermann M.K. Swerlick R. Kunsch C. Rosen C.A. Ahmad M. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1866-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Therefore, a balanced process between pro- and anti-metastatic reactive oxygen species effects may underlie the interaction of metastatic cells with the vascular endothelium. According to this idea, it has been shown that IL-1-dependent HSE production of H2O2 contributes to melanoma cell adhesion enhancement, which would compensate for its direct cytotoxic effects on adherent, vulnerable melanoma cells and lead to the metastatic progression of H2O2-resistant melanoma cells (6Anasagasti M.J. Alvarez A. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Vidal- Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The involvement of H2O2 in cancer cell cytotoxicity is supported by experiments in which the hepatic metastasizing ability of B16M cells, following intrasplenic inoculation of IL-1-treated mice, was reduced by administration of exogenous catalase or enhanced by exogenous superoxide dismutase (6Anasagasti M.J. Alvarez A. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Vidal- Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, to date, data reported on H2O2released by the vascular endothelium during the process of cancer cell adhesion regard to relative values. Quantitative determination of H2O2 levels is necessary to assess whether H2O2 induces tumor cytotoxicity by itself or requires some additional factor(s). Elegant studies by Fidler and co-workers (15Li L. Kilbourn R.G. Adams J. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2531-2535PubMed Google Scholar) showed that NO, the formation of which is catalyzed by constitutive NO synthetase or inducible NO synthetases expressed in many cells, promotes lysis of tumor cells by cytokine-activated endothelial cells. Interestingly, an inverse correlation between expression of inducible NO synthase activity and production of metastasis in murine melanoma cells was found (16Dong Z. Staroselsky A.H. Qi X. Xie K. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 789-793PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, recent results have identified the existence of a natural defense mechanism against cancer metastasis whereby the arrest of tumor cells in the liver induces endogenous NO release, leading to sinusoidal tumor cell killing and reduced hepatic metastasis formation (17Wang H.H. McIntosh A.R. Hasinoff B.B. Rector E.S. Ahmed N. Nance D.M. Orr W.F. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5862-5869PubMed Google Scholar). Although the biochemical mechanisms by which NO elicits its cytotoxic action are not well understood, it has been proposed that, for example, NO inactivates iron-containing prosthetic groups, a mechanism that leads to inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and DNA synthesis (18Hibbs Jr., J.B. Taintor R.R. Vavrin Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1805) Google Scholar), and that NO reacts very rapidly with O⨪2, which results in formation of the highly oxidant peroxynitrite (19Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropolous H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Moreover previous reports have shown cooperative cytotoxic action of nitric oxide and H2O2 in, for example, Escherichia coli (20Pacelli R. Wink D.A. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. DeGraff W. Friedman N. Tsokos M. Samuni A. Mitchell J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1469-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and Fu5 rat hepatoma cells (21Ioannidis I. De Groot H. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that endothelial NO and H2O2 or their derived reactive species may have synergistic cytotoxic effects on cancer cells. Interestingly, reactive nitrogen and oxygen radicals formed during hepatic ischemia-reperfusion have been recently involved in the killing of weakly (but not highly) metastatic colorectal cancer cells (22Jessup J.M. Battle P. Waller H. Edmiston K.H. Stolz D.B. Watkins S.C. Locker J. Skena K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1825-1829PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that GSH, which is involved in cell defense against nitrosative and oxidative stress (23Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 9/10: 916-921Crossref Scopus (1352) Google Scholar), protects circulating B16M cells against HSE-induced cytotoxicity (24Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Obrador E. Estrela J.M. McCuskey R.S. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have used endothelial nitric-oxide synthetase (eNOS) gene disruption andN G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME)-induced inhibition of NO production to study the role of endothelium-derived NO in the killing of B16M cells. In these studies, we have compared B16M cells cultured to low (LD) and high (HD) densities, which have different GSH contents and different metastatic activities (25Carretero J. Obrador E. Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Estrela J.M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our results show that H2O2released by the HSE was not cytotoxic; however, NO was particularly tumoricidal in the presence of the peroxide. A high percentage of tumor cells with high GSH content survived the combined nitrosative and oxidative attacks and may represent the main task force in metastatic invasion. B16M cells derived from B16-F10 subline cells were cultured (24Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Obrador E. Estrela J.M. McCuskey R.S. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), pH 7.4, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm NaHCO3, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Male C57BL/6J mice (10–12 weeks old) were from the Institut Français pour la Fiévre Aphtose Credo (L'Arbreole, France). All animals received care according to the criteria outlined by the National Institutes of Health (Rockville, MD). The HSE was separated and identified as previously described (26Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Rocha M. Asumendi A. Barbera-Guillem E. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Tissue digestion was carried out by sequential perfusion of type E Pronase and collagenase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) plus Pronase solutions. The liver was then minced and stirred in another solution containing Pronase, collagenase, and DNase (type I deoxyribonuclease, Sigma). Sinusoidal cells were separated in a 17.5% (w/v) metrizamide gradient. Cultures of the HSE were established and maintained in pyrogen-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as described above for the B16M cells. Differential adhesion of endothelial cells to the collagen matrix and washing allow complete elimination of other sinusoidal cell types (Kupffer, stellate, and lymphocytes) from the culture flasks. This assay was based on a previously published methodology (6Anasagasti M.J. Alvarez A. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Vidal- Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, B16M cells were loaded with 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene OR) (106 cells were incubated in 1 ml of HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 µg of BCECF-AM and 5 µl of Me2SO for 20 min at 37 °C). After washing, BCECF-AM-containing cells were resuspended in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml and added (0.2 ml/well) to endothelial cells (plated 24 h before) and also to plastic- or collagen-precoated control wells. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C; and 20 min later, the wells were washed three times with fresh medium and read for fluorescence. This was measured using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Labsystems, Manchester, United Kingdom). The number of adhering tumor cells was quantified by arbitrary fluorescence units based on the percentage of the initial number of B16M cells added to the HSE culture. Damage to B16M cells during their in vitro adhesion to the HSE was measured, as previously described (24Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Obrador E. Estrela J.M. McCuskey R.S. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), using tumor cells loaded with calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Integrity of B16M cells cultured alone was assessed by trypan blue exclusion and by measuring lactate dehydrogenase activity (27Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Emzymatic Analyses. Academic Press, New York1985: 574-579Google Scholar) released to the extracellular medium (24Anasagasti M.J. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Obrador E. Estrela J.M. McCuskey R.S. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Other reagents used in experiments of tumor cytotoxicity were from Sigma (l-NAME, catalase, and superoxide dismutase). Recombinant murine TNF-α (2 × 107 units/mg of protein), recombinant murine IL-1β (20 µg/mg of protein), and recombinant murine interferon-γ (IFN-γ; 105 units/mg of protein) were obtained from Sigma. Stock solutions (5 × 105 units/ml TNF-α, 100 ng/ml IL-1β, and 25 × 104 units/ml IFN-γ) were diluted in sterile physiological saline solution (0.9% NaCl), adjusted to pH 7.0, and stored at 4 °C. The assay of H2O2 production was based on the H2O2-dependent oxidation of homovanillic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid) to a highly fluorescent dimer (2,2′-dihydroxydiphenyl-5,5′-diacetic acid), which is mediated by horseradish peroxidase (28Ruch W. Cooper P.H. Baggiolini M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 63: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). For this purpose, cells were cultured in the presence of 100 µmhomovanillic acid and 1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase. A linear relationship between fluorescence (λex = 312 nm and λem = 420 nm) and amount of H2O2was found in the range of 0.1–12 nmol/2-ml assay. Nitrite and nitrate determinations were performed using the methodology of Braman and Hendrix (29Braman R.S. Hendrix S.A. Anal. Chem. 1989; 61: 2715-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Briefly, measurement of NO2− levels was made by monitoring NO evolution via chemiluminescence detection from a measured sample placed into a refluxing solution of iodide/acetic acid (which will reduce only NO2−, but not NO3−, to NO). Total NO2− plus NO3− (NOx) determinations were made by monitoring NO evolution from a measured sample placed into a boiling VCl3/HCl solution (which will reduce both NO2− and NO3− to NO). The determination of NO3− levels was made by subtracting the NO2− value from the NOx value. Quantitation was accomplished using a standard curve made up of known amounts of NO2− and NO3−. For GSH determination, cells were treated at 4 °C with ice-cold perchloric acid (2%). Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and GSH was measured in the supernatants using the GSHS-transferase reaction as previously described (30Akerboom T.P.M. Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). For GSSG analysis, cells were treated at 4 °C with ice-cold perchloric acid (12%) containing 40 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) and 2 mmbathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid (Sigma). Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the acidic supernatants were derivatized and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as previously reported (31Asensi M. Sastre J. Pallardó F.V. Garcı́a de la Asunción J. Estrela J.M. Viña J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The acid-soluble fractions (200 µl) obtained for GSH determination (see above) were added to 25 µl of 2.0% ammonium sulfamate. To the mixtures were added 200 µl of 0.5 n HCl containing 0.25% HgCl2 and 5% sulfanilamide. Then, 250 µl of a 0.5n HCl solution containing 0.25%N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamide dihydrochloride were added to the mixtures. After incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, the amount of S-nitrosothiols (RSNO) was determined spectrophotometrically at 550 nm using S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) as a standard (32Nishikawa M. Sato E.F. Kashiba M. Kuroki T. Utsumi K. Inoue M. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fresh GSNO solution was obtained, before each experiment, by incubating equimolar GSH and sodium nitrite in acidified water at 0 °C as previously described (33Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (381) Google Scholar). GSNO concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 335 nm (ε = 992 dm3 × mol−1 × cm−1) and at 545 nm (ε = 15.9 dm3 × mol−1 × cm−1). No significant decomposition of GSNO occurred during the assay procedures. GSH monoisopropyl(glycyl) ester was obtained as previously described (34Martensson J. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thionitrobenzoic acid was used to characterize the stability of a NO solution obtained by bubbling a 50 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) with NO gas as previously described (35Clancy R.M. Miyazaki Y. Cannon B.J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Levels of NO were measured as previously reported (36Ahmed A. Dunk C. Kniss D. Wilkes M. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 779-791PubMed Google Scholar) using a Sievers NOA 280A chemiluminescence analyzer. Briefly, samples (100 µl) were injected into a nitrogen purge vessel containing a 1% solution of sodium iodide in glacial acetic acid to liberate gaseous NO from dissolved NO and nitrite. The sample gas was then exposed to ozone to form activated nitrogen dioxide (NO2*), which luminescences in the red and far-red spectrum and is detected by a red-sensitive photomultiplier tube. For calculations, we used a calibration curve obtained by measuring a series of sodium nitrite standards. The saturated NO solution (2 mm) was stored at 4 °C and used for experiments within 15 min. During this time period, NO concentration in stock solutions remained unchanged. Peroxynitrite was prepared from amyl nitrite and H2O2 following the methodology described by Uppu and Pryor (37Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 322-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amyl nitrite (20 ml) was added to 80 ml of 2 m H2O2, 2m NaOH, and 2 mm DTPA, and the solution was stirred for 2 h at 4 °C. The lower aqueous layer was removed and washed three times with ice-cold hexane. Residual H2O2 was removed by gradually adding 10 g of manganese dioxide to the −OONO solution while it was being stirred on ice for 1 h. The solution was filtered and passed through a 10 × 1-cm MnO2 column equilibrated with 0.1 m NaOH to remove traces of H2O2. The −OONO was diluted with 0.1 n NaOH to ∼50 mm immediately before use. The concentration of −OONO was measured spectrophotometrically (extinction coefficient of 1670m−1 × cm−1 at 302 nm). Nitrite contamination of the−OONO solution was ∼20% of the −OONO concentration (less than that reported in the original method (37Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 322-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Addition of catalase to decomposed peroxynitrite at pH 7.0 resulted in no oxygen evolution (measured at 37 °C with a Clark-type electrode), which implies no H2O2 contamination in the solution. B16M cells were detached (see above) and washed twice at 4 °C in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate medium (pH 7.4) without Ca2+ or Mg2+ added and containing 0.5 mm EGTA and then resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 5 µg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma)) at a density of ∼15 × 106cells/ml. Cells were disrupted by sonication (Braun Labsonic; 50% output, three times for 10-s each), and the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. GSH reductase activity (30Akerboom T.P.M. Sies H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar), GSH peroxidase (selenium-dependent) activity (using H2O2 as a substrate) (38Flohé L. Gunzler W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (4025) Google Scholar), superoxide dismutase activity (39Flohé L. Otting F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), and catalase activity (40Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18299) Google Scholar) were measured in the supernatants as described previously. Generation of eNOS-deficient mice was carried out as previously described (41Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laumback V.E. Sherman P.A. Sessa W.C. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13176-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). We interbred heterozygous (+/−) eNOS-deficient mice to generate eNOS+/+ and eNOS−/− mice. We used eNOS+/+ and wild-type C57BL/6J mice as controls. Genotyping of the animals was performed by Southern blotting DNA from tail biopsies. The identification of eNOS+/+ and eNOS−/− mice was as previously described (41Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laumback V.E. Sherman P.A. Sessa W.C. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13176-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20-µg samples were digested with BamHI, separated on 1.0% agarose gels, and then transferred to nylon-supported nitrocellulose. The blots were hybridized using a random primer-labeled 1.4-kilobase pair eNOS cDNA probe (41Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laumback V.E. Sherman P.A. Sessa W.C. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13176-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). A 5.3-kilobase pair fragment was diagnostic of the endogenous eNOS locus, and a 6.4-kilobase pair fragment was diagnostic of the targeted allele. Livers were rapidly removed and embedded in Miles Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sciscope, Iowa City, IA) for preparing 5-µm frozen sections. Sections were fixed with acetone (−20 °C at the start) for 10 min at 4 °C and washed twice with PBS containing 0.1 g of bovine serum albumin/100 ml at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with 0.25% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase activity and washed again with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubation for 3 h with PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Sections were then washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h with a mouse anti-eNOS antibody (diluted 1:100; kit 482731, Calbiochem). After sections were washed for 15 min with PBS, biotinylated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (kit 4002, Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) was applied for 30 min. Sections were washed and developed with the Vectastain ABC system (Vector Labs, Inc.) using tetrahydrochloride. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and examined by light microscopy for staining of eNOS (dark-purple color), which was positive in wild-type and eNOS+/+ mice and completely negative in eNOS−/− mice (data not shown). Data were analyzed by Student'st test. The incubation of endothelial cells with cytokines can induce the production of different mediators, among which are NO (15Li L. Kilbourn R.G. Adams J. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2531-2535PubMed Google Scholar) and H2O2 (12Anasagasti M.J. Alvarez A. Avivi C. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Rolling and early adhesion of B16M cells to the HSE, release of H2O2 by the HSE, and late adhesion of surviving melanoma cells are sequential steps during B16M cell attachment to the HSE that occur in a short period (3–6 h) (6Anasagasti M.J. Alvarez A. Martin J.J. Mendoza L. Vidal- Vanaclocha F. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the first set of experiments, to determine the rates of NO and H2O2 generated by the HSE, freshly isolated sinusoidal cells were treated with different concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, and/or IFN-γ (Table I). All these cytokines have been shown to be capable of activating endothelial cells (12Anasagasti M.J. Alvarez A. Avivi C. Vidal-Vanaclocha F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Li L. Kilbourn R.G. Adams J. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2531-2535PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, we identified the optimal concentrations of the cytokines to be 100 units/ml TNF-α, 1 ng/ml IL-1β, and 50 units/ml IFN-γ (data not shown). We found that NOx and H2O2 accumulated in the culture medium in a time-dependent fashion and that NOx and H2O2 production was maximal in the presence of TNF-α and IFN-γ (Table I).Table IIn vitro time course production of NO and H2O2 by cytokine-activated HSEAdditionsNOxH2O23 h6 h3 h6 hBasal medium−IFN-γ0.8 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.623 ± 667 ± 12+IFN-γ2.0 ± 0.41-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).5.8 ± 1.31-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).25 ± 558 ± 11TNF-α−IFN-γ1.3 ± 0.33.1 ± 0.633 ± 7127 ± 251-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).+IFN-γ4.2 ± 0.91-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).11.8 ± 1.11-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).39 ± 61-bp < 0.05.167 ± 221-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).IL-1β−IFN-γ0.7 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.331 ± 6146 ± 331-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).+IFN-γ1.7 ± 0.41-bp < 0.05.4.3 ± 0.81-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).29 ± 4136 ± 181-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).TNF-α + IL-1β−IFN-γ1.7 ± 0.51-bp < 0.05.3.8 ± 0.71-bp < 0.05.35 ± 8158 ± 301-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).+INF-γ3.3 ± 0.71-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).11.2 ± 1.71-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).48 ± 81-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).149 ± 261-ap < 0.01 comparing each value with its control (“Basal medium”).Cytokines or vehicle (physiological saline) was added to 24-h cultured HSE cells.

https://openalex.org/W2034811882,"Inherited, single-base substitutions are found at only two positions, C−52T and C−92G, within the proximal 5′-regulatory region (within −1096 to +48) of the human integrin α2gene. We recently reported that the T−52substitution results in decreased binding of transcription factor Sp1 to adjacent binding sites, decreased transcription of the α2 gene, and reduced densities of platelet α2β1. In this study, we identify an additional Sp1-binding site at position −107 to −99 and show that the adjacent dimorphic sequence C−92G also influences the rate of gene transcription. In the erythroleukemia cell line Dami, transfected promoter-luciferase constructs bearing the G−92 sequence exhibit roughly a 3-fold decrease in activity relative to the C−92constructs. In transfected CHRF-288-11 megakaryocytic cells, the corresponding activity decreases by 5-fold. DNase I footprinting of the promoter region with Dami nuclear extracts showed a protected segment at −107 to −99 that can be deprotected by coincubation with molar excess of a consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide. Gel mobility shift assays and supershift assays with specific antibodies indicate that Sp1 binds to this region of the α2 gene promoter. Mutation of the Sp1 binding element within −107 to −99 in constructs containing either C−92 or G−92abolishes basal promoter activity and eliminates the binding of Sp1. The G−92 sequence has a gene frequency of 0.15 in a typical Caucasian population, and the presence of this allele correlates with reduced densities of platelet α2β1. The combined substitution G−92/T−52 has an additive influence on gene transcription, resulting in an 8-fold decrease in transfected Dami cells or a 20-fold decrease in transfected CHRF-288-11 cells. In summary, the natural dimorphism C−92G within the proximal 5′-regulatory region of the human integrin α2 gene contributes to the regulation of integrin α2β1 expression on megakaryocytes and blood platelets and must thereby modulate collagen-related platelet function in vivo. Inherited, single-base substitutions are found at only two positions, C−52T and C−92G, within the proximal 5′-regulatory region (within −1096 to +48) of the human integrin α2gene.

Santoro S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 113-120PubMed Google Scholar). A single copy of the α2 gene is present in the haploid genome, located on chromosome 5 (5q23–31) (2Jaspers M. Marynen P. Aly M.S. Cuppens H. Hilliker C. Cassiman J.J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1991; 17: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). There is, on average, a 5-fold range in platelet α2β1 density among normal individuals that correlates with the inheritance of at least three α2 gene alleles and directly influences the rate of platelet adhesion to collagens ex vivo (3Kritzik M.

The expression of α2 is known to be regulated at the transcriptional level in megakaryocytes (8Zutter M.M. Painter A.A. Staatz W.D. Tsung Y.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 463-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have defined a “core” promoter region within positions −92 to −30 relative to the transcription start site (+1), and subsequent studies have determined that the proximal 961 bp1 of the 5′-flanking region of α2 isolated from the K562 cell line direct cell type-specific suppressor and enhancer activity in cells of epithelial origin (8Zutter M.M. Painter A.A. Staatz W.D. Tsung Y.L. Blood. 1995; 86: 3006-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Painter A.S. Tsung Y.L. Gafford A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 463-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within the core promoter, two consensus Sp1/Sp3 binding elements are located on either side of the C−52T dimorphism previously described by us (15Jacquelin B. Tarantino M. Kritzik M. Rozenshteyn D. Koziol J.A. Kunicki T.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A second dimorphism, C−92G, lies immediately downstream from the nonanucleotide sequence -GGGGCGGGG- with the general properties of another Sp1 and/or Sp3 binding element. Aside from this proximal 5′-regulatory region, additional distal sequences are thought to contain enhancer elements necessary for maximal transcription of the α2 gene in cells of megakaryocytic lineage (8Zutter M.M. Painter A.A. Staatz W.D. Tsung Y.L. Blood. 1995; 86: 3006-3014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zutter M.M. Painter A.D. Yang X. Blood. 1999; 93: 1600-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Partial sequences of the human α2 gene have been reported (3Kritzik M. Savage B. Nugent D.J. Santoso S. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 2382-2388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a complete reference gene sequence can be assembled from overlapping genomic clones deposited at GenBankTM (accession numbers AC008773,AC008966, AC016619, AF035968, AF062039, AF113511, NM002203, L24121, andU31518). We recently provided evidence that allelic differences in receptor density, initially observed on blood platelets, correlate with the C−52T dimorphism within the 5′-regulatory region of the α2 gene (15Jacquelin B. Tarantino M. Kritzik M. Rozenshteyn D. Koziol J.A. Kunicki T.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This dimorphism influences transcription by altering the affinity of the flanking sequences for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. Furthermore, the sequence T−52, which attenuates Sp1/Sp3 binding and transcriptional activity, is in linkage disequilibrium with one of the alleles (A3) known to be associated with diminished expression of the integrin on platelets. In the current study, we provide additional characterization of the 5′-regulatory region of this gene. First, we provide direct evidence that the nonanucleotide -GGGGCGGGG- within positions −107 and −99 is indeed a Sp1-binding site. In addition, we show that the second dimorphism, C−92G, immediately downstream from this site also modulates gene transcription and acts synergistically with C−52T to vary transcription rates by more than an order of magnitude in megakaryocytic cell lines, such as Dami or CHRF-288-11. These two sequence dimorphisms represent the only naturally occurring differences within the proximal 5′-regulatory region of the gene (position −1096 to +48). These inherited sequence differences have a profound influence on expression levels of this gene in megakaryocytic cells. Platelets and mononuclear cells were isolated from citrated whole blood, as described previously (3Kritzik M. Savage B. Nugent D.J. Santoso S. Ruggeri Z.M. Kunicki T.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 2382-2388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Personnel of the General Clinical Research Center at Scripps Research Institute and Scripps Clinic recruited normal blood donors and performed phlebotomies. Dami cells were a generous gift from Dr. David Wilcox (Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI). The megakaryocyte cell line CHRF-288-11 (16Fugman D.A. Witte D.P. Jones C.L.A. Aronow B.J. Lieberman M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1252-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. M. A. Lieberman (Cincinnati, OH). Donor genotype with respect to alleles A1, A2, and A3 was determined by BglII/AseI restriction fragment length polymorphism using blood mononuclear cell DNA, as described previously (15Jacquelin B.

Exon sequence numbering is based on the incomplete human α2 cDNA sequence reported by Takada and Hemler (17Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Primers were designed to amplify the 1.1 kilobase of proximal promoter region sequence in three overlapping segments. The first polymerase chain reaction-amplified genomic segment (681 bp) encompasses nucleotide −1096 through nucleotide −414 and was generated using forward primer A2ProF3 (5′-CCCATTCAGCTCATAGTAGCATTC-3′) and reverse primer A2ProR2 (5′-ACTAGCCCTAAACCACAGTG-3′). The second segment (800 bp), which spans nucleotide −609 through nucleotide +191, was generated using forward primer A2ProF2 (5′-CACACAGCTCTTGCAGCAGG-3′) and reverse primer A2ProR (5′-TTGACTGAGCGCTACCACC-3′). The third polymerase chain reaction-amplified genomic segment (437 bp), which begins at nucleotide −244 and ends at nucleotide +191, was generated using forward primer A2ProF (5′-CAGGAAAGCCTGCCA-3′) and reverse primer A2ProR. From the third polymerase chain reaction product, the sequence of the segment −146 to +86 (which encompasses the −92 and −52 dimorphisms) was obtained using the sequencing primers 5′-GGTTTGCAGAGGATACCC-3′ (A2ProR1), corresponding to nucleotides 69–86, and 5′- ACGAGCCGAGGTGCA-3′ (A2ProF1), corresponding to nucleotides −146 to −131. With appropriate informed consent, blood samples were collected from normal volunteers and processed in the GCRC. Six volumes of whole blood were mixed with 1 volume of acid-citrate dextrose National Institutes of Health formula A. An aliquot of whole blood was centrifuged over a cushion of Ficoll-Hypaque to isolate mononuclear cells that were preserved by freezing in Me2SO and served as a source of genomic DNA for genotyping. A second aliquot of whole blood was prepared for fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, as described previously (4Kunicki T.J. Orchekowski R. Annis D. Honda Y. Blood. 1993; 82: 2693-2703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Jacquelin B. Tarantino M. Kritzik M. Rozenshteyn D. Koziol J.A. Kunicki T.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Kunicki T.J. Kritzik M. Annis D.S. Nugent D.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1939-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis was initiated within 72 h after phlebotomy. Measurements were obtained using a Becton-Dickinson FACS StarPlus flow cytometer within the technical laboratory of the GCRC. DNA sequences were obtained using an Applied Biosystems ABI Prism Model 377 DNA Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by personnel in the DNA Core Laboratory of the Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute. Standard two-way analysis of variance was used to make comparisons of platelet α2β1 density, as determined from flow cytometry binding measurements. In this regard, two murine monoclonal anti-α2β1 antibodies, 12F1 and 8C12, were used for the determination of α2β1 density, and analyses were performed separately for each antibody. The main effects evaluated under the analysis of variance model were α2 genotype (three categories, denoted as 1/1, 1/2, or 2/2) and number of G−92 or T−52 substitutions (three categories: 0, 1, and >1). In addition, terms representing interaction between genotype and number of substitutions were incorporated into the analysis of variance models but were found not to be statistically significant at conventional α level 0.05. Nuclear extracts were obtained from CHRF288-11 or Dami cells by isolation of nuclei, as described previously (19Ye J. Zhang X. Dong Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An optimal number of cells (nominally, 0.5–1 × 108) were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (centrifugation at 1800 × g for 10 min) and then lysed in 0.5 ml of 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in 25 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.9, containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotonin (lysis buffer). The nuclei were pelleted and rinsed once in lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40 (centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min). By vigorous micropipetting, nuclei were then physically disrupted in 25 mm HEPES, 500 mm KCl, pH 7.9, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotonin (extraction buffer). When nuclei were sufficiently emulsified, the mixtures were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min, and the supernatants were collected. The concentration of nuclear proteins in the supernatants was determined by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow DNA polymerase (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ten μg of nuclear protein were mixed with labeled DNA (5–10 × 104 cpm) in 10 μl of 25 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.9, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (binding buffer) and incubated at ambient temperature for 1 h. In reactions using competitor DNA, a molar excess (as indicated) of the unlabeled competitor DNA fragment was used. In antibody-based supershift or inhibitor experiments, 3 μg of anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, anti-AP2, anti-nuclear factor-κB, or anti-Egr-1 (each from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was preincubated with the nuclear extract for 15 min at ambient temperature before addition of the 32P-labeled probe. The reaction products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 4% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (37.5:1) in 0.045 m Tris borate and 0.001 m EDTA, pH 7.9 (0.5× Tris borate-EDTA). Protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. The Dami and CHRF-288-11 cells were transfected by electroporation using a Cell-Porator (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately 1 × 107 cells were transfected in 500 μl of Iscove's modified medium containing 20 μg of plasmid DNA and 20 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase DNA by electroporation at 300 V and 1180 microfarads. The proximal 5′-regulatory region of the α2 gene corresponding to −244 through +40 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA from a donor homozygous for C−52 and C−92 as template. The oligonucleotide primers were designed to incorporate KpnI (forward) andBglII (reverse) restriction sites, and the product was inserted into the polylinker site upstream of the luciferase (LUC) reporter gene in the plasmid pGL2-enhancer (Promega, Madison, WI). The primer sequences were as follows (restriction sites areunderlined): A2PROFORKpnI, 5′-GAGGGTACCAGGAAAGCCTGCCA-3′; and A2PROREVBglII, 5′-GAGAGATCTAGAAGCTGTCCAGAGGGC-3′. The desired fragment was cloned in pGL2-enhancer to form pα2244-LUC. The insert sequence was confirmed in both directions using primers supplied by the manufacturer (Promega; GLprimer1 and GLprimer2). The plasmids pα2244Δ52T-LUC, pα2244Δ92G-LUC, and pα2244 Δ92GΔ52T-LUC were generated from pα2244-LUC as follows: the pα2244 insert was excised usingSmaI and HindIII restriction sites and cloned into the pALTER-1 vector (Promega). The T−52, G−92, and T−52G−92 variants were then produced by mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's protocol using oligonucleotides −52T (5′-GGGGCGGGCTGGGGCGGGC-3′), −92G (5′-GGGCGCGGCCGGGAGCAGAT-3′) or both, respectively. The mutated sequences were confirmed in both directions using SP6 and T7 primers (supplied by the manufacturer), and the inserts were excised and cloned into pGL2-Enhancer and pGL2-Basic. The sequences of the resultant plasmids pα2244Δ52T-LUC, pα2244Δ92G-LUC, and pα2244 Δ92GΔ52T-LUC were confirmed to be identical to pα2244-LUC except for the single-base substitutions T−52 and/or G−92. The DNase I footprinting reactions were performed as described previously (22Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 23Raney A.K. Milich D.R. McLachlan A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3919-3925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter DNA cloned in pGL2-enhancer was digested with XmnI to produce a DNA probe representing the sequence segment from −248 to −14. The probe was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase reaction, digested with BspHI, and subsequently gel-purified (only one end is labeled). An aliquot of the labeled probe (20,000 cpm) was incubated with 0, 20, 40, or 80 μg of nuclear extract in 50 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The mixture was incubated for 20 min on ice and then incubated for 2 min at room temperature. RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) (0.75 unit in 53 μl of 5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mmMgCl2) was added. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 90 μl of 1% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, and 30 mm EDTA plus 100 μg/ml yeast RNA. The mixture was then extracted with phenol:chloroform, and DNA was precipitated with ethanol. Sequencing reactions of the DNA segment corresponding to the DNA probe used for footprinting were carried out by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of Sanger et al. (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) using the fmol sequencing kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequencing primer was 5′-GTTTCTGGGCAGCTCCTGCAGC-3′. Reaction products were analyzed using 6% denaturing (urea) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (QuickPoint; Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) followed by autoradiography. The naturally occurring dimorphism C−52T is located precisely in the middle of tandem Sp1/Sp3 binding elements of the core promoter (15Jacquelin B. Tarantino M. Kritzik M. Rozenshteyn D. Koziol J.A. Kunicki T.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas the C−92G dimorphism lies closely downstream from the nonanucleotide -GGGGCGGGG- at −107/−99 (Fig.1). Our findings, summarized below, indicate that the −107/−99 sequence represents an additional Sp1-binding site. To determine the identity of the transcription factors that might bind to the promoter sequence surrounding the dimorphic position at −92, DNase I footprinting analysis was performed with nuclear extracts from Dami, K562, or CHRF-288-11 cells and a promoter probe representing the region −246 to −14 on the plus strand. Comparable results were obtained with nuclear extracts from each of the three cell lines, and an example of the results obtained with Dami cell extracts is depicted in Fig.2. The footprint spanned the promoter region from about −200 to roughly −30 on the plus strand. Incubation with Dami cell extracts showed protected segments at −107 to −99 and −61 to −43 (Fig. 2). Gel mobility shift analyses were conducted with nuclear proteins from either Dami or CHRF288-11 cells using a 29-bp core promoter fragment (bp −111 to −82) that contains either −92C or −92G as probe (Fig. 3). In addition, the same segments synthesized with mutations in the upstream Sp1-like binding element to create Cm or Gm. In a representative gel mobility shift assay using a nuclear extract from Dami cells (Fig. 4), one major complex is formed in the presence of either 92C (lane 1) or 92G (lane 2). Three nonspecific minor complexes appear with faster relative mobilities. Mutation of the Sp1-like binding element in either Cm (lane 3) or Gm (lane 4) eliminated the formation of the major complex. Based on supershift analyses with polyclonal antibodies, including anti-nuclear factor-κB (lanes 5 and 6), anti-AP2 (lanes 7 and8), anti-Sp1 (lanes 9 and 10), anti-Sp3 (lanes 11 and 12), or anti-Egr-1 (lanes 13 and 14), this complex is formed by the binding of Sp1 only. The C→G base substitution at −92 has only a small effect, if any, on the binding of Sp1 to the flanking segment, such that the intensity of the complex formed with −92G is usually less intense than that formed with −92C (for example, comparelane 2 versus lane 1). Lastly, complex formation with either 92C (lane 15) or 92G (lane 16) was essentially abolished by preincubation with a 200-fold molar excess of the unlabeled Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (Sp1c; Promega).Figure 4Binding of nuclear proteins from Dami cells to oligonucleotides containing the putative Sp1 site. Nuclear extracts were prepared from Dami cells and incubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotides described in Fig. 3 either in the absence of antiserum (lanes 1–4) or after incubation with anti-nuclear factor-κB (lanes 5 and 6), anti-AP2 (lanes 7 and 8), anti-Sp1 (lanes 9 and10), anti-Sp3 (lanes 11 and 12), or anti-Egr-1 (lanes 13 and 14). Co-incubation with a 200-fold molar excess of cold Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (Promega) (Sp1c) completely inhibited complex formation with either probe (lanes 15 and 16). The radiolabeled nucleotide probes are indicated at the top of each lane and included: C (lanes 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and15), G (lanes 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and16), Cm (lane 3), and Gm (lane 4). The position of the major Sp1-containing complex is indicated to theleft of the gel (arrowhead). Anasterisk denotes the position of supershifted complexes inlanes 9 and 10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Additional gel mobility shift assays were conducted to examine whether the effect of the −92C or −92G substitution has an effect on the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the downstream elements at position −52. This was accomplished using the long probes depicted in Fig.5. Note that these probes contain the −92C or −92G dimorphism and the two tandem Sp1/Sp3 binding elements that flank −52C, but not the Sp1 binding element located upstream at −107/−99. As shown in Fig. 6, the same four complexes are formed between Dami cell nuclear proteins and the −92C long probe (lane 2) or −92G long probe (lane 7): the slowest mobility complex (arrowhead) is given by binding of Sp1 and/or Sp3; the remaining three complexes are nonspecific (see below). In the absence of Dami cell nuclear proteins, no complexes are formed (lanes 1 and 6). Addition of either anti-Sp1 (lanes 3 and 8) or anti-Sp3 (lanes 4 and 9) results in a supershifted complex (asterisk) in the case of either probe. Coincubation with a 200-fold molar excess of the consensus Sp1-binding oligonucleotide (Sp1c) inhibits formation of the specific complex (lanes 5and 10), whereas the nonspecific complexes remain. Repeated attempts to generate specific complexes in gel mobility shift assays using even longer probes containing both the −52 Sp1-binding elements and the Sp1-binding element upstream at −107/−99 consistently failed, most likely because of the sheer length of these longer oligonucleotide probe sequences.Figure 6Binding of nuclear proteins from Dami cells to long oligonucleotide probes.Radiolabeled long oligonucleotide probes containing either −92 C (lanes 1–5) or −92G (lanes 6–10) were incubated alone (lanes 1 and6) or with a nuclear protein extract from Dami cells, followed by no additions (lanes 2 and 7), addition of polyclonal anti-Sp1 antibody (lanes 3 and8), addition of polyclonal anti-Sp3 antibody (lanes 4 and 9), or addition of a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled consensus Sp1-binding oligonucleotide (Sp1c). Anarrowhead to the left of the gel indicates the major Sp1-containing complex. Supershifted complexes are designated by an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thus, the nuclear protein from Dami cells that forms a specific complex with either the −92C or the −92G probe is the Sp1 transcription factor, and the C/G substitution at −92 does not affect the binding of Sp1 to the downstream elements surrounding the −52 C/T dimorphism. Essentially identical results are obtained with nuclear proteins from the CHRF288-11 cell line (data not shown). To investigate how decreased affinity of the G−92 and T−52sequences might influence in situ transcription rates, we compared the relative activities of promoter-LUC constructs. The construct pα2244-LUC contains the consensus promoter sequence from −244 through +40 (GenBankTM accession numberAF062039) with C−92 and C−52. This sequence, derived from a comparison of 62 haplotypes, is not identical to the published α2promoter sequence (11Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Painter A.S. Tsung Y.L. Gafford A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 463-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but can be considered the allele sequence most equivalent to that published sequence. The remaining plasmid constructs are as follows: pα2244Δ92G-LUC, which contains the replacement G at −92; pα2244Δ52T-LUC, which contains the replacement T at −52; and pα2244Δ92GΔ52T-LUC, which contains both replacements. Each construct was ligated into the vector pGL2-basic or pGL2-enhancer (Promega). Identical results were obtained with either vector, so the cumulative results were averaged. Promoter activities were compared after transient transfection of Dami cells or CHRF-288-11 cells. Cotransfection with the vector pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. The results of these assays are summarized in Fig.7. Dramatic differences were observed in both Dami cells (Fig.7 A) and CHRF-288-11 cells (Fig. 7 B). In Dami cells (five separate experiments), the mutation Δ92G results in a 3-fold decrease in promoter activity, Δ52T also results in a 3-fold decrease in activity, and the combination Δ92GΔ52T decreases activity by 8-fold. This finding is consistent with an additive effect of each substitution on gene transcription. In Dami cell transfectants, this translates into a decrease in reporter gene activity. Even more dramatic differences were obtained for CHRF288-11. In three experiments, Δ92G caused roughly a 5-fold d"

It binds directly and very specifically to the cytoplasmic domains of both the cation-independent and cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptors. TIP47 is 43% identical to a lipid droplet-associated protein named adipophilin; much of the identity resides near the N termini of these proteins. It was recently reported in this journal, in a study using antiserum from this laboratory, that TIP47 is a constituent of lipid droplets (Wolins, N. E., Rubin, B., and Brasaemle, D. L. (2001) J.

We show here that the findings of Wolins et al. were likely due to either a cross-reactive, unidentified protein in HeLa cells that is recognized by our antiserum and/or the fact that our serum also cross-reacts with the adipophilin protein itself, shown directly by expression of adipophilin inEscherichia coli. Using antibodies specific for residues 152–434 of TIP47, we show that TIP47 is not a constituent of lipid droplets.

Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). When TIP47 is depleted from cells using antisense oligonucleotides, MPRs are mis-sorted to the lysosome (1Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Moreover, TIP47 is needed in cytosol to support endosome-to-trans-Golgi network transport of MPRs, both in vitro (1Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and in living cells (1Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R.

Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) that has been shown to be important for the normal trafficking of this receptor (3Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14471-14476Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutation of these residues in the cation-dependent MPR has the same consequence as depleting cells of TIP47; in both cases, the cation-dependent MPR is misdirected to the lysosome (1Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 3Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14471-14476Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Binding of TIP47 to the cation-independent MPR is somewhat more complex and involves a membrane-proximal, hydrophobic motif located between residues 48 and 74 that is presented by more carboxyl-terminal residues that appear to contribute to the overall folding of the cytoplasmic domain (4Orsel J.G. Sincock P.M. Krise J.P. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9047-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Finally, TIP47 is very specific in its interaction with MPRs in that it fails to bind to the cytoplasmic domains of the low density lipoprotein receptor (1Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), furin, phosphorylated furin, carboxypeptidase D, and TGN 38 (5). Given our extensive functional and structural analysis of TIP47, we were surprised by a recent report in this journal suggesting that TIP47 is present on lipid droplets (6Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These workers used an antiserum from our laboratory, and we show here that those results were likely due to a cross-reactive, unidentified protein that is recognized by our antiserum and especially enriched in HeLa cells. In addition, our antiserum recognizes recombinant adipophilin. Using affinity-purified antibodies, we demonstrate that TIP47 is not present in lipid droplets. Rabbit and mouse anti-MPR antibodies and rabbit anti-TIP47 antiserum were previously characterized reagents (1Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R.

Human ADRP cDNAs (Incyte Genomics, Inc.) were used to produce two His-tagged, truncated ADRP forms (ADRP 1–75 and ADRP 1–202). Polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into pTrcHis2-TOPO (Invitrogen). His-tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as described (1Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R.

Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-Rabbit and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgGs were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA. Human HeLa cells and African green monkey kidney epithelial (BS-C-1) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or minimal essential medium, respectively, supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. For fatty acid treatment, cells were incubated for 18 h in media supplemented with 600 μm oleic acid (Sigma) complexed to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at a molar ratio of 6:1 (6Wolins N.E.

HeLa or BS-C-1 cells were grown on 60-mm plates and treated for 18 h with oleic acid.

Protein extracts were centrifuged for 10 min, and supernatants were collected. Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Immunofluorescence was performed as described by Warren et al. (8Warren G. Davoust J. Cockcroft A.

Brefeldin A treatment was for 20 min in media containing 5 μg/ml brefeldin A. All primary antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution except affinity-purified anti-TIP47, which was used at 1:500 dilution. Texas Red- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:1000. Images were obtained using a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope. TIP47 (1Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R.

As shown in Fig. 1, much of the homology resides near the N termini of these proteins whereas similarity is seen over the length of both coding regions. Although adipophilin is found on lipid droplets, its function is currently unknown; moreover, the functional basis for the similarity between TIP47 and adipophilin remains entirely unclear.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) carried out immunofluorescence analyses using our crude polyclonal anti-TIP47 antiserum (1Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that this antiserum recognizes a single 47-kDa polypeptide in immunoblots of K562 cells (1Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and localizes by cell fractionation and light microscopy to MPR-containing late endosomes in Chinese hamster ovary and bovine tracheal epithelial cells (1Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Because of the unexpected report of Wolins et al. (6Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) we tested our serum on extracts from HeLa cells and also BS-C-1 cells. As shown in Fig.2, the antiserum recognized two polypeptides in HeLa cells (47 kDa and ∼60 kDa) and one polypeptide in BS-C-1 cells. In longer exposures, many additional polypeptides could be detected (not shown). Affinity purification of the antiserum using full-length TIP47 yielded the same results (not shown). The above data suggested that lipid droplet staining using crude antiserum (6Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) could have been due to a cross-reacting protein, rather than TIP47. Therefore, we prepared an affinity-purified antibody specific for the C-terminal half of the protein. TIP47 residues 152–434 were expressed as a His-tagged protein (2Carroll K.S. Hanna J. Simon I. Krise J. Barbero P. Pfeffer S.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and used to affinity purify the antiserum. In contrast to the total serum, antibodies specific for residues 152–434 recognized a single polypeptide in both BS-C-1 and HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 2, lower panel). With a more TIP47-specific antibody in hand, we compared the subcellular localizations of proteins recognized by either anti-full-length TIP47 antibodies or anti-TIP47 residue 152–434 antibodies. Lipid droplet formation was induced by incubating cells with oleic acid (6Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, in the absence of oleic acid, TIP47 staining was detected on perinuclear structures that are likely to represent late endosomes (1Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Upon treatment with oleic acid, BS-C-1 cells displayed significant lipid droplet accumulations. Importantly, whereas the anti-TIP47 (full-length) antibodies led to fluorescent decoration of lipid droplet structures in cells treated with oleic acid (white arrows,upper panels), the anti-TIP47-(152–434) antibody clearly did not (white arrows, lower panels). Indeed, TIP47 staining was excluded from regions of the cytoplasm enriched in lipid droplets. Thus in BS-C-1 cells, TIP47 is not present on lipid droplets. Like TIP47, MPRs showed a perinuclear distribution that was unchanged in oleic acid-treated cells (Fig. 4). In addition, in contrast to the findings of Wolins et al. (6Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) the localization of MPRs was unchanged in the presence of brefeldin A (Fig. 5). Whereas β-COP staining became rapidly diffuse, MPRS remained adjacent to the nucleus in a tight and discrete structure. Previous work has shown that endosomal structures tubulate in some types of brefeldin-A-treated cells (9Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 10Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, MPRs retain a concentrated, perinuclear staining (10Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) such as that shown here.Figure 5Brefeldin A does not alter MPR localization in BS-C-1 cells.

Our initial studies utilized BS-C-1 cells, which are flat and display beautiful cellular morphology. Attempts to localize TIP47 in oleic acid-treated HeLa cells using affinity-purified antibodies revealed a very low level labeling of lipid droplets (data not shown). Thus it was essential for us to determine whether the affinity-purified antibodies cross-reacted to some extent with adipophilin itself. Adipophilin cDNAs representing the N-terminal 75 or 202 residues were obtained commercially and expressed as His-tagged polypeptides in bacteria. Extracts from bacteria expressing adipophilin polypeptides were then analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.6, both anti-TIP47 serum and anti-TIP47-(152–434)-specific antibodies recognized adipophilin peptides. However, anti-TIP47 serum gave a much stronger reaction than the affinity-purified, anti-TIP47-(152–434) antibody; we have shown that the serum recognizes N-terminal epitopes as well as C-terminal epitopes (data not shown). Thus anti-TIP47 serum sees both TIP47 and adipophilin; antiserum affinity-purified against residues 152–434 of TIP47 lost significant titer to adipophilin but still recognized the recombinant protein to some extent. We would have liked to preadsorb our serum to remove all anti-adipophilin antibodies, but this was impossible because the expressed, recombinant, N-terminal fragments were difficult to express in significant quantities, and a full-length adipophilin cDNA clone was not available. It is important to note that endogenous TIP47 and adipophilin polypeptides migrated identically in immunoblots of BS-C-1 cells (Fig.7). When adipophilin was detected using a commercial monoclonal antibody, it was clearly induced in BS-C-1 cells treated with oleic acid. The mobility of the adipophilin protein was indistinguishable from endogenous TIP47 analyzed on the same gel and identified using affinity-purified anti-TIP47-(152–434) antibody. Unlike adipophilin, TIP47 levels were slightly decreased with oleic acid (Figs. 2 and 7). The comigration of adipophilin and TIP47, along with the cross-reactivity of our polyclonal antibody, make it difficult to distinguish between these functionally distinct protein molecules. We have shown here that TIP47 and adipophilin proteins share epitopes that are recognized by a polyclonal anti-TIP47 antiserum. Moreover, whereas many of these epitopes seem to be concentrated near the closely related N termini of these proteins, at least one shared epitope resides between TIP47 residues 152 and 202 because antibodies directed against TIP47 residues 152–434 recognize bacterially expressed adipophilin residues 1–202. Examination of TIP47 residues 152–202 (Fig. 1) reveals many identities between TIP47 and adipophilin in this region that likely lead to cross-reactivity. Such cross-reactivity could easily have misled another research group to conclude, erroneously, that TIP47 is a constituent of lipid droplets (6Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, cross-reaction with recombinant adipophilin protein was not tested in that study. We have shown that TIP47 is not a component of lipid droplets in cells that accumulate large numbers of these structures and show oleic acid induction of adipophilin polypeptide. All of these results are consistent with our well documented functional analyses of TIP47 as a protein that mediates MPR trafficking in mammalian cells (1Dı́az E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar,2Carroll K.S. Hanna J. Simon I. Krise J. Barbero P. Pfeffer S.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Further studies will be needed to help elucidate the function of adipophilin and the significance of its relationship to TIP47. The recent connection between lipid droplets and caveolin and cholesterol regulation surely adds to the potential interest in adipophilin and its role in lipid droplet structure and function (11van Meer G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: F29-F34Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We thank John Hanna for help with the adipophilin expression and members of the Pfeffer lab for their comments."
https://openalex.org/W2323639502,"Bloom syndrome (BS) is a recessive human genetic disorder characterized by short stature, immunodeficiency and an elevated risk of malignancy. The gene mutated in BS, BLM, encodes a RecQ-type DNA helicase. BS cells have mutator phenotypes such as hyper-recombination, chromosome instability and an increased frequency of sister chromatid exchange (SCE). To define the primary role of BLM, we generated BLM−/− mutants of the chicken B-cell line DT40. In addition to characteristics of BLM−/− cells reported previously by the other group, they are hypersensitive to genotoxic agents such as etoposide, bleomycin and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and irradiation with the short wave length of UV (UVC) light, whereas they exhibit normal sensitivity to X-ray irradiation and hydroxyurea. UVC irradiation to BLM−/− cells during G1 to early S phase caused chromosomal instability such as chromatid breaks and chromosomal quadriradials, leading to eventual cell death. These results suggest that BLM is involved in surveillance of base abnormalities in genomic DNA that may be encountered by replication forks in early S phase. Such surveillance would maintain genomic stability in vertebrate cells, resulting in the prevention of cellular tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2330808362,"Neuroblastoma (NB) cells reportedly accumulate wild-type p53 exclusively in the cytoplasm. However, immunofluorescence assays with five different antibodies showed that p53 accumulates in the nucleus of up to 10% of NB cells. PAb1801 detected cytoplasmic 'punctate structures' which were also found in p53-null cells, rendering this antibody unsuitable for p53 detection. A comparison of DO-1 and PAb1801 staining in NB tissue sections confirmed the results obtained with NB cells. Nuclear accumulation of p53 was induced in NB cells using substances which disturb p53's tertiary structure at its zinc finger motif, or by treatment with mitomycin C. Constitutive nuclear accumulation was observed in an SK-N-SH variant, AW-1, which has a point mutation in p53 at Cys176>Ser, disturbing the same motif. Even though p53 showed DNA-binding capability after mitomycin C treatment of NB cells, the target gene products MDM2 and p21(WAF1,CIP1,SDI1) were not synthesized and no p53 transactivating activity measured in a reporter gene assay. Therefore we suggest that p53 in NB cells might be predominantly in a conformation refractory to integration into the transcriptional complex, resulting in at least partial transcriptional inactivity, hyperactive nuclear export and resistance to degradation by exogenously expressed MDM2."
https://openalex.org/W2058851743,"Inka cells of insect epitracheal glands (EGs) secrete preecdysis and ecdysis-triggering hormones (PETH and ETH) at the end of each developmental stage. Both peptides act in the central nervous system to evoke the ecdysis behavioral sequence, a stereotype behavior during which old cuticle is shed. Secretion of ETH is stimulated by a brain neuropeptide, eclosion hormone (EH). EH evokes accumulation of cGMP followed by release of ETH from Inka cells, and exogenous cGMP evokes secretion of ETH. The secretory responses to EH and cGMP are inhibited by the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine, and the response to EH is potentiated by the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A. Staurosporine did not inhibit EH-evoked accumulation of cGMP. Changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ in Inka cells during EH signaling were monitored via fluorescence ratioing with fura-2-loaded EGs. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ increases within 30–120 s after addition of EH to EGs, and it remains elevated for at least 10 min, corresponding with the time course of secretion. Secretion is increased in dose-dependent manner by the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, a treatment that does not elevate glandular cGMP above basal levels. The secretory response to EH is partially inhibited in glands loaded with EGTA, while cGMP levels are unaffected.

An important outcome of this interplay is the production of cuticular exoskeleton. After new cuticle is produced at the end of each stadium, old cuticle must be shed. This shedding of old cuticle, termed ecdysis, occurs in a stereotype sequence of behaviors (1Weeks J.C. Truman J.W. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1984; 155: 407-422Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These behaviors, most thoroughly studied in the lepidopterous insect Manduca sexta, are initiated and completed in 60–70 minutes by actions of the peptide hormones preecdysis and ecdysis-triggering hormones (PETH and ETH)1 (2Zitnan D.

Nature. 1981; 291: 70-71Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The findings from a number of laboratories suggest that the ecdysis sequence is set in motion following peripheral release of PETH and ETH (2Zitnan D. Ross L.S. Zitnanova I. Hermesman J.L. Gill S.S. Adams M.E. Neuron. 1999; 23: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3Zitnan D. Kingan T.G. Hermesman J.L. Adams M.E. Science. 1996; 271: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and the behaviors are driven by multiple loci in the CNS (5Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 1329-1340PubMed Google Scholar, 6Novicki A. Weeks J.C. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 1757-1769PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gammie S.C. Truman J.W. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar). ETH is secreted by Inka cells of the segmentally distributed epitracheal glands (3Zitnan D. Kingan T.G. Hermesman J.L. Adams M.E. Science. 1996; 271: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) in response to EH (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar). EH is secreted hormonally by peripheral neurohemal endings and centrally from axons, both of the brain-centered “ventromedial” neurosecretory cells (9Hewes R.S. Truman J.W. J. Comp. Physiol. 1991; 168: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Truman J.W. Copenhaver P.F. J. Exp. Biol. 1989; 147: 457-470Google Scholar), probably in response to ETH (7Gammie S.C. Truman J.W. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ewer J. Gammie S.C. Truman J.W. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 869-881PubMed Google Scholar). Together these findings suggest a model for endocrine events in ecdysis in which ETH and EH are secreted in mutually positive feedback, leading to near depletion in stores of both peptides (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ewer J. Gammie S.C. Truman J.W. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 869-881PubMed Google Scholar). Support for this model comes from several lines of evidence, including the appearance of PETH and ETH in hemolymph at the onset of the behavior (2Zitnan D. Ross L.S. Zitnanova I. Hermesman J.L. Gill S.S. Adams M.E. Neuron. 1999; 23: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It has not yet been possible to adequately determine the timing of EH secretion, because of its very low concentrations in hemolymph. Nevertheless, cGMP, a second messenger in the action of EH (12Morton D.B. Truman J.W. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1985; 157: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Truman J.W. Mumby S.M. Welch S.K. J. Exp. Biol. 1979; 84: 201-212Google Scholar), accumulates in epitracheal glands during the ecdysis sequence (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ewer J. Gammie S.C. Truman J.W. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 869-881PubMed Google Scholar). Since ETH is secreted during EH signaling, elucidating events in the transduction cascade is critical for understanding the endocrinology of ecdysis. Cyclic GMP increases in epitracheal glands in response to EH, and if added to culture medium, cGMP will evoke a secretory response (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanism by which it causes secretion or if it is even necessary for secretion is not known. In addition, findings to date have not addressed a possible role for Ca2+ in ETH secretion; Ca2+ is known to participate in secretory events by neurons and neuroendocrine cells (14Douglas W.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1968; 34: 451-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 15Knight D.E. von Grafenstein H. Athayde C.M. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 451-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here we report the results of pharmacological studies with epitracheal glands showing that cGMP is likely to act in secretion via activation of a protein kinase. In addition, we show that Ca2+ levels increase in Inka cells during EH signaling and that this increase is required for a full secretory response. Staurosporine and cGMP were obtained from Sigma; calyculin A and thapsigargin were from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). EGTA-AM was obtained from Calbiochem. Inhibitors were dissolved in dry dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and diluted into Weever's saline (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar) containing 0.3% BSA (Weever's/BSA) for use; final Me2SO was 0.1% and did not affect basal or evoked secretion. EGTA-AM was diluted in Weever's/BSA to 0.1 mm, and glands were loaded for 1 h before activation with EH. Tobacco hornworms (Manduca sexta) were reared on artificial diet as described previously (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar). Epitracheal glands were removed, attached to a short segment of trachea, from pharate pupae under Weever's saline, and cultured individually in 40 μl of medium. For most experiments we used glands from insects at “anterior shrink” stage (AS), ∼3.5–4 h before pupation (16Truman J.W. Taghert P.H. Reynolds S.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1980; 88: 327-337Google Scholar). Enzyme inhibitors were loaded by placing glands in medium with inhibitor for periods of 30–90 min, after which aliquots for ETH assay were removed and EH for activation of glands was added. Glands were cultured for an additional 20–30 min, and the medium was removed for assay. In some experiments glands were first removed from the medium and placed in ethanol:1 n HCl, 100:1, for homogenization and quantification of cGMP; the remaining medium was set aside for ETH determination. ETH and cGMP were quantified by enzyme immunoassay as described previously (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar). Values for ETH in the medium after stimulation were corrected for the generally low level of ETH secreted during loading of inhibitor. Statistical comparisons of data sets were done by the Mann-Whitney test of medians. Calcium levels in individual Inka cells were quantified using the calcium indicator dye fura-2 and a video-enhanced microscope system. EGs were dissected from AS pharate pupae. Some glands were selected in which the Inka cell was separated on the trachea from the other gland cells (3Zitnan D. Kingan T.G. Hermesman J.L. Adams M.E. Science. 1996; 271: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 17Klein C. Kallenborn H.G. Radlicki C. J. Insect Physiol. 1999; 45: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Glands were loaded for 30 min with 2–10 μm fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Weever's/BSA medium and then rinsed twice for 5 min in Weever's/BSA. Glands were mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated “no. 0” coverslips in 90 μl of Weever's/BSA, the trachea bearing the gland adhered to the coverslip to provide an unobstructed view of the Inka cell. A Nikon TE-300 inverted microscope equipped with Neofluar optics and a xenon light source was used for fluorescence imaging. The microscope was outfitted with a 10-position filter wheel (Sutter Instruments), which contained both 340- and 380-nm bandpass filters for fura-2 excitation. The filter cube contained a dichroic mirror and a 510-nm longpass filter. Ten microliters of medium containing EH was added and mixed. An intensified charge couple device camera (Princeton Instruments) was used to capture images every 3 or 6 s during excitation at 340 and 380 nm. An image processor (MetaFluor; Universal Imaging) averaged four frames at each wavelength to increase signal-to-noise prior to storage of 340 and 380 images and the 340/380 ratio. Backgrounds were subtracted at each wavelength from cell-free fields, and the relative calcium concentration was calculated from a calibration curve generated from known calcium standards (Molecular Probes). We previously showed that cGMP accumulates in epitracheal glands during ETH secretion in response to EH exposure and that exogenous cGMP and its 8-bromo analogue activate secretion of ETH by glands in vitro (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar). To address the possibility that cGMP acts by regulating the activity of a protein kinase and the phosphorylation state of a protein in the transduction cascade, we tested the action of protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors in basal and stimulated secretion. We also considered the possibility that protein kinases act upstream of cGMP accumulation. In these experiments, individually cultured glands were removed from medium and extracted for cGMP determination, and the medium was collected for ETH determination. Staurosporine, an alkaloid from Streptomyces sp., is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C (18Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar), as well as most other kinases (19Rüegg U.T. Burgess G.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 218-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of staurosporine to inhibit EH-evoked secretion of ETH by EGs in vitro. While 0.1 μm inhibitor was without effect, inhibition developed at higher concentrations; the EC50 was 0.2–0.4 μm. (Fig. 1). Staurosporine did not have a measurable effect on the low basal rate of secretion (data not shown). Because EH evokes an increase in glandular cGMP, and exogenous cGMP evokes a small secretory response (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to know if the staurosporine finding reflects inhibition of a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) required for secretion. As an indirect measure, we tested the action of staurosporine in secretion evoked by exogenous cGMP. While the response was variable (Table I) it appears that staurosporine reduces secretion evoked by cGMP and 8-Br-cGMP, suggesting that elevation of endogenous cGMP during EH stimulation would lead to secretion in a staurosporine-inhibitable manner. Together, these considerations suggest that EH stimulation leads to activation of a PKG in the transduction cascade, and that this activation plays an important role in secretion.Table IInhibition of cyclic nucleotide-evoked release by staurosporineNucleotideControl1 μm staurosporinecGMP (200 μm)413 ± 511 (13)219 ± 271 (12)1-aMann-Whitney one-tailedp value is not significant.8Br-cGMP (100 μm)212 ± 178 (13)110 ± 91 (13)1-bMann-Whitney one-tailedp value is 0.04.Glands were preincubated in staurosporine for 60 min; an aliquot of medium was then removed for ETH assay and nucleotide was added for an additional 30 min.

If phosphorylation of substrate proteins is required in EH signaling, the activity of a protein phosphatase may limit the secretory response. Accordingly, we tested the action of calyculin A, a sponge toxin that inhibits phosphatases (20Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Hartshorne D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2780-2781Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar) with selectivity for types 1 and 2A (21Ishihara H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Karaki H. Ozaki H. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Calyculin A increases both basal secretion and potentiates, by ∼5-fold, secretion resulting from threshold doses of EH (Fig.2). The type II pyrethroid cypermethrin, a protein phosphatase type 2B (calcineurin) inhibitor (22Enan E. Matsumura F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1777-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), was without effect in evoked secretion (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that basal and EH-stimulated secretion is quantitatively determined, at least in part, by a balance between the activities of kinases and a protein phosphatase similar to the mammalian type 1 or 2A enzyme. The suggestion above that staurosporine acts on a PKG does not rule out an action on other kinases. To test the possibility that such a kinase could regulate cGMP production, we measured EH-evoked cGMP accumulation in the presence of staurosporine. As already shown (Fig. 1), staurosporine inhibits evoked secretion (Fig.3A); however, cGMP accumulation was not reduced (Fig. 3B). This suggests that staurosporine does not inhibit kinases that stimulate synthesis of cGMP. Exocytotic secretion in neuroendocrine cells and neurons is triggered by elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ (14Douglas W.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1968; 34: 451-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 23Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To begin testing the possibility that Ca2+ also participates in secretion from Inka cells, we investigated the effect of EH on cytoplasmic Ca2+. Fura-2-loaded glands were monitored for fluorescence with alternate 340 nm and 380 nm excitation. When 340/380 ratios were monitored for 10 min without application of EH, no change was observed (data not shown). In 10 preparations containing a total of 17 Inka cells, 12 cells responded to EH (Fig.4). Upon application of EH ratios began to increase within 15–195 s, with higher concentrations leading to shorter onsets to measurable increases (Fig. 4, C andF). A plateau in the 340/380 ratio was reached within ∼6 min, and it remained elevated for the duration of 10-min experiments. With × 20 magnification the ratio appeared to increase uniformly across the surface of the cell (Fig. 4, Aand B). At × 40 magnification, however, it was apparent that the highest ratios were attained at the cell margin, while lower ratios were found in underlying cortical regions (Fig. 4,D and E). In this preparation, a slight reduction of the ratio occurred over the trachea adjacent to the Inka cell (Fig.4, E and F). Over the Inka cell the ratio increased 60–175% above that found prior to application of EH. Increases of this magnitude, when compared with the calibration set, are found to correspond to ∼90–350% increases in Ca2+. Ratios obtained for Ca2+ solutions from a calibration set are shown in Table II. Determinations of absolute values of Ca2+ in Inka cells from this set were not made because of an uncertain basis for comparing the environment for fluorescence in the large (200 μm, diameter) Inka cell with that in the saline of the calibration set. Nevertheless, it appeared that Ca2+ rose maximally to ∼1 μm in the response to EH.Table II340/380 values for Ca2+ standardsCa2+340/380Ca2+340/380nmnm00.082250.32170.133510.37380.146020.64650.1813500.771000.1839,8001.051500.25Standards containing the indicated amounts of Ca2+ were prepared on microscope slides and coverslipped. Images were collected at 340 and 380 nm excitation (see “Experimental Procedures”) and ratios calculated. Open table in a new tab Standards containing the indicated amounts of Ca2+ were prepared on microscope slides and coverslipped. Images were collected at 340 and 380 nm excitation (see “Experimental Procedures”) and ratios calculated. We showed earlier that removal of extracellular Ca2+ does not diminish EH-evoked secretion (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar). To address the possibility that Ca2+ mobilized from intracellular stores drives secretory events in the Inka cell, we tested the effect of thapsigargin, an inhibitor of ATP-dependent Ca2+ pumps found in cardiac sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum (24Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drøbak B. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2998) Google Scholar). While 0.01 μm thapsigargin was without effect, ETH release occurred at 0.1 and 1.0 μm inhibitor (Fig.5A). At 1.0 μmthapsigargin release was already evident at 30 min, and further release apparently did not occur; 2.1 pmol/gland released represents ∼15% of the total ETH. In separate experiments we also tested the ability of thapsigargin to affect accumulation of cGMP during evoked secretion. If Ca2+ is required as a direct or indirect activator upstream of guanylyl cyclase, an accumulation of cGMP might parallel thapsigargin-evoked secretion of ETH. However, thapsigargin did not significantly alter the amount of cGMP at the end of a 30-min incubation (Fig. 5B). This finding does not rule out a role for a PKC in regulating guanylyl cyclase, however, since production of neutral lipid (diacylglycerol, a second messenger in PKC activation) would not be expected in thapsigargin treatment. These considerations aside, our findings suggest that Ca2+ mobilization can evoke ETH release without participation of cGMP. To test the possibility that mobilization of Ca2+ is required in secretion, we preloaded glands with the membrane-permeable ester of EGTA (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the presence of 3 mm Ca2+ in the extracellular medium, a small inhibition of release was observed in EGTA-loaded glands (Fig.6). When glands were incubated in 0 Ca2+ medium, EGTA again reduced evoked secretion; the small additional effectiveness of EGTA in the absence of Ca2+ may not be significant. Therefore, while Ca2+ influx may occur and participate in secretion, it seems not to be required for a full response (Fig. 6; see also Ref. 8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar). To further address the possibility of cross-talk between Ca2+ and cGMP pathways, we tested the effect of EGTA loading on EH-evoked cGMP accumulation. EH (100 pm) evoked accumulation of 87 ± 74 fmol cGMP (S.D.,n = 11); when glands were preincubated for 50 min in 0.01 or 0.1 mm EGTA-AM and then rinsed before EH activation, they accumulated 105 ± 70 (n = 11) and 75.1 ± 64 (n = 12) fmol cGMP, respectively; these values are not significantly different from those determined in the absence of EGTA. Therefore, the data suggest that cGMP accumulation is unaffected by EGTA, while ETH secretion is reduced ∼36% (Fig.6). A summary of our findings and a model for signal transduction in Inka cells is shown in Fig. 7. A cell surface receptor is coupled to a guanylyl cyclase such as that described fromM. sexta CNS (25Nighorn A. Byrnes K.A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2525-2531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cyclase produces cGMP in response to EH. A phosphodiesterase limits secretion in unstimulated cells (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar), presumably by its action on cGMP that would otherwise accumulate. A PKG, inhibitable with staurosporine, promotes phosphorylation of a substrate protein, while a phosphatase, sensitive to calyculin A, limits basal and evoked secretion, presumably by reversing the action of the PKG. Either in parallel or in sequence with cGMP production, cytoplasmic Ca2+ increases with a time course that is similar to that of cGMP accumulation (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ increase during secretion plateaus at low micromolar concentrations, suggesting high affinity effectors. This increase may occur either 1) in parallel with activation of guanylyl cyclase, for instance, via separate activation of receptors in intracellular stores leading to mobilization of Ca2+, or 2) in sequence with guanylyl cyclase, by a PKG-mediated activation of a substrate protein, which then participates in Ca2+ mobilization. While we do not yet know if cGMP can affect Ca2+ mobilization, findings from our EGTA and thapsigargin experiments suggest that Ca2+ does not act in a pathway leading to cGMP accumulation. Proteins that function as effectors of second messenger cGMP and Ca2+ have not been identified, but could include effectors of translocation of granules to a readily releasable pool as well as mediators of docking and/or fusion immediately prior to exocytosis. We have shown that release of ETH from Inka cells of insect epitracheal glands requires participation of a protein kinase that likely is activated by cGMP during EH signaling. The extent of secretion during stimulation is limited by a calyculin A-inhibitable protein phosphatase. In addition, we find that cytoplasmic Ca2+ increases during signaling and that its time course is similar to that of secretion. Thapsigargin, an effective inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent ATPase in endoplasmic reticulum, increases basal secretion. Intracellular EGTA, a Ca2+chelator, blunts stimulated secretion, showing that Ca2+mobilization participates in secretion. Staurosporine is effective in inhibiting EH-evoked secretion (IC50 = 0.2–0.4 μm), indicating a requirement for a protein kinase in ETH release. Moreover, secretion evoked by exogenous cGMP and 8-Br-cGMP is also inhibited by staurosporine. While the percent inhibition is lower than for EH-evoked secretion (compare Fig. 1, Table I), some of the difference may be accounted for by basal and staurosporine-insensitive secretion in both sets of glands. The current findings with staurosporine, together with our earlier demonstration that cGMP accumulates during EH signaling (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that a PKG would be activated in EH signaling and participate in the transduction cascade leading to ETH secretion. In an additional test of a role for PKG, we assayed the PKG inhibitors (R p)-8-(para-chlorophenylthio)-guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate and (R p)-8-Br-guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate (26Butt E. Eigenthaler M. Genieser H.-G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 269: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 27Nakazawa M. Imai S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 253: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) for activity in inhibiting EH-evoked secretion. However, neither was effective in inhibiting evoked secretion (data not shown). This apparently negative result must be viewed in the context of our observation that 8-Br-cGMP is only weakly active in evoking secretion (Table I), suggesting that insect and mammalian kinases differ in their pharmacological sensitivities or that these exogenous analogues are excluded from access to the enzyme compartment. Additional evidence indicating a role for protein kinases in secretion is the finding that the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A potentiates basal and EH-evoked secretion. Inhibition of phosphatases presumably unmasks or synergizes with a basal level of protein kinase activity, allowing accumulation of a phosphoprotein that is a component in the transduction cascade. We found earlier that the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine potentiates basal secretion (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar), presumably by unmasking activity of a guanylyl cyclase. Together these findings indicate that a guanylyl cyclase and one or more protein kinases are active in unstimulated cells, but that secretion is held in check by hydrolytic enzymes. In EH-stimulated cells the kinase is then able to outpace the phosphatase. This conclusion does not rule out, however, the possibility that the phosphodiesterase or phosphatase is negatively regulated to affect secretion in stimulated cells. That phosphatases may be important regulators of secretion was shown in studies with adrenal chromaffin cells, in which calyculin A treatment lead to increased phosphorylation of vimentin, redistribution of granules toward the cell periphery, and enhanced basal secretion (28Gutierrez L.M. Quitanar J.L. Rueda J. Viniergra S. Reig J.A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 88-95PubMed Google Scholar). However, the kinase in these events is likely to be a PKC, rather than a PKG (29Vitale M.L. Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Trifaró J.-M. Neuroscience. 1992; 51: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Characterized PKGs have low K a values, 0.05–1.0 μm (30Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). cGMP is low in unstimulated Inka cells, 1–3 fmol in 200-μm diameter cells from pharate pupae (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar). If contained in the outer 20% of cell volume as suggested by immunocytochemical findings (11Ewer J. Gammie S.C. Truman J.W. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 869-881PubMed Google Scholar), the basal concentration of cGMP would be ∼0.5 μm, well within the range for activation of identified PKGs. Activated cells contain 10–50 times greater cGMP. A role for PKGs in EH signaling in the CNS of M. sexta was suggested earlier by the observation that two 54-kDa proteins are phosphorylated in response to EH and cGMP (31Morton D.B. Truman J.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The identity of these proteins and their role in signaling, or whether they might also be present in epitracheal glands, has not been determined. Identified PKGs in insects include DG2, which has been implicated in regulating foraging behavior in Drosophila melanogaster (32Osborne K.A. Robichon A. Burgess E. Butland S. Shaw R.A. Coulthard A. Pereira H.S. Greenspan R.J. Sokolowski M.B. Science. 1997; 277: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), although substrate proteins for DG2 or the tissue expressing enzyme required for the phenotype have not been identified. In addition, insect PKGs have not been characterized pharmacologically. In addition to determining the effects of kinase inhibitors on ETH secretion, we also quantified their effects on cGMP accumulation. We found that staurosporine does not affect EH-evoked cGMP accumulation, indicating that its action in ETH release is downstream of guanylyl cyclase. Tamoxifen has also been shown to inhibit EH-evoked cGMP accumulation in M. sexta transverse nerves, a finding that suggested the action of a PKC in regulating EH-activated guanylyl cyclase (33Morton D.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 814: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the specificity of these inhibitors in insect preparations has not been addressed. EH evoked an increase in Ca2+ in the Inka cell; the time to onset was concentration-dependent. With 5 nm EH the time to onset was ∼20 s, while with 0.1 nm onset occurred at ∼200 s. The Ca2+ response occurred as a sustained plateau, rising to at most 1–2 μm in concentration. The relatively slow onsets in Inka cells are similar to those observed in a variety of nonexcitable cells in which two receptor classes, either seven-transmembrane domain-containing receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases, are coupled through G-proteins to phospholipase C (34Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). In Inka cells, the elevation in Ca2+ appeared to sweep uniformly across the surface of the cell during the rising phase. However, use of a × 40 objective clearly revealed higher concentrations of Ca2+ in the cortex of the cell, suggesting either influx or local “hot” areas of mobilization from subplasmalemmal intracellular stores (Fig. 5). We interpret this result with caution, however, because of uncertainty in focal plane thickness and contribution from curvature of the large diameter (200 μm) cell. It will be important to record the response in smaller cells from earlier developmental stages and to use optical sectioning of confocal microscopy to reveal regional details of mobilization. Nevertheless, in other preparations mobilization from intracellular stores activates Ca2+ influx by “capacitative calcium entry” (35Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G. St J. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and our observation of higher 340/380 in cortical regions of Inka cells is consistent with the prediction of influx. We addressed the significance of Ca2+ elevation in two ways: first, we found that thapsigargin treatment leads to secretion of ETH. Thapsigargin treatment leads to elevation of cytoplasmic levels of Ca2+ (36Heemskerk J.W.M. Feijge M.A.H. Sage S.O. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 37Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of effector proteins via its inhibition of ATP-dependent Ca2+ pumps with net release from intracellular stores (38Rutter G.A. Theler J.-M. Wollheim C.B. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Second, we showed that EGTA blunts, but does not abolish, EH-evoked secretion. This finding indicates that a portion of secretion is Ca2+-independent (and presumably cGMP-dependent). However, a conclusion on the role of Ca2+ will first require quantifying the effectiveness of EGTA in blunting Ca2+ mobilization during secretion as well as quantifying secretion by andCa2+ mobilization in individual glands. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that Ca2+ mobilization is both sufficient for partial secretion of available stores and necessary for full secretion in response to EH. The range of times to onset of Ca2+ mobilization was similar to onset in cGMP increase determined earlier (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar), although the temporal resolution in cGMP measurements was relatively crude in comparison with the Ca2+ measurements reported here. These observations lead us to consider the possibility that one second messenger could affect the accumulation of the other. While we have not yet addressed this directly, the lack of effect of thapsigargin and EGTA on cGMP levels suggests that Ca2+ does not directly regulate cGMP accumulation. In this regard, Inka cells differ from other preparations, e.g. rat pancreatic acini, in which thapsigargin does evoke an increase in cGMP (37Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In pancreatic acini, however, Ca2+ activates nitric-oxide synthase, which then leads to cGMP production (37Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12645-12653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a pathway that does not function in Inka cells (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar). These considerations also raise the converse question that has not yet been addressed: does cGMP play a role in Ca2+mobilization or influx in Inka cells? The importance of elevated Ca2+ in regulating exocytotic secretion by aminergic and peptidergic endocrine cells has long been known (14Douglas W.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1968; 34: 451-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 39Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1049-1955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A high degree of cooperativity for the action of Ca2+ in secretion indicates activity at multiple steps, from early events associated with translocation of vesicles to a readily releasable pool (40von Rüden L. Neher E. Science. 1993; 262: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) to late events following docking and associated with fusion (41Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In early events the slower kinetics of rearrangements in cytoskeleton and/or translocation of vesicles to release sites allow for the involvement of both Ca2+ and other second messengers such as cyclic nucleotides (39Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1049-1955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 42Trifaró J.-M. Vitale M.L. Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 225: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Late events are mediated by “sensor” proteins found in vesicle and plasma membranes, the activation of which by relatively high [Ca2+] in neurons or lower [Ca2+] in endocrine or neuroendocrine cells leads to fast fusion of an immediately releasable pool of vesicles. ETH secretion begins at the onset of preecdysis behavior and increases by positive feedback from EH to maximal activation, driving the behavioral sequence to its conclusion (3Zitnan D. Kingan T.G. Hermesman J.L. Adams M.E. Science. 1996; 271: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp.

Receptor activation leads to accumulation of cGMP (8Kingan T.G. Gray W. Zitnan D. Adams M.E. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 3245-3256PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ewer J. Gammie S.C. Truman J.W. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 869-881PubMed Google Scholar) and elevation of Ca2+(this report). The signaling events leading to Ca2+elevation have not been identified, but could follow production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, shown to accumulate in CNS tissue in response to EH (43Shibanaka Y. Hayashi H. Takai M. Fujita N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 44Morton D.B. Simpson P.J. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1995; 165: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, since cGMP production in CNS is decreased by phospholipase C inhibitors (44Morton D.B. Simpson P.J. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1995; 165: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), EH receptor activation may lead to cGMP and Ca2+ mobilization through a common PLC, which, once activated, leads to accumulation of each second messenger independent of the other. Earlier work showed that EH is likely to activate a PKG in the CNS (31Morton D.B. Truman J.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our findings with staurosporine suggest that EH acts similarly in Inka cells. If so, identifying the kinases and their substrates, the Ca2+effector proteins, and the functions of these proteins in the transduction cascade represents an exciting challenge for the immediate future."
https://openalex.org/W2325976969,"Oncogenic Ras (H-Ras G12V) inhibits skeletal myogenesis through multiple signaling pathways. Previously, we demonstrated that the major downstream effectors of Ras (i.e., MEK/MAPK, RalGDS and Rac/Rho) play a minor, if any, role in the differentiation-defective phenotype of Ras myoblasts. Recently, NFκB, another Ras signaling target, has been shown to inhibit myogenesis presumably by stimulating cyclin D1 accumulation and cell cycle progression. In this study, we address the involvement of NFκB activation in the Ras-induced inhibition of myogenesis. Using H-Ras G12V and three G12V effector-loop variants, we detect high levels of NFκB transcriptional activity in C3H10T1/2-MyoD cells treated with differentiation medium. Myogenesis is blocked by all Ras proteins tested, yet only in the case of H-Ras G12V are cyclin D1 levels increased and cell cycle progression maintained. Expression of IκBα SR, an inhibitor of NFκB, does not reverse the differentiation-defective phenotype of Ras expressing cultures, but does induce differentiation in cultures treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) or in cultures expressing the RelA/p65 subunit of NFκB. These data confirm that NFκB is a target of Ras and suggest that the cellular actions of NFκB require additional signals that are discriminated by the Ras effector-loop variants. Results with IκBα SR convincingly demonstrate that H-Ras G12V does not rely on NFκB activity to block myogenesis, an observation that continues to implicate another unidentified signaling pathway(s) in the inhibition of skeletal myogenesis by Ras."
https://openalex.org/W2321949033,"Gads is a SH2 and SH3 domain-containing, hematopoietic-specific adaptor protein that functions in signalling from the T cell receptor. Gads acts by linking SLP-76, bound by the carboxy-terminal Gads SH3 domain, to tyrosine phosphorylated LAT which contains binding sites for the Gads SH2 domain. Gads is distinguished from Grb2 and the closely related Grap protein by the presence of a 120 amino acid unique region between the SH2 domain and the carboxy terminal SH3 domain. Here we demonstrate that the unique region of Gads contains a capase cleavage site. Induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes results in detectable Gads cleavage by 60 min. Gads cleavage is blocked in vivo by treating cells with a caspase 3 inhibitor. A putative caspase 3 cleavage site was identified within the unique region and mutation of this site prevented Gads cleavage in vitro, and in vivo. The Gads cleavage products retained the predicted binding specificity for SLP-76 and LAT. Expression of the Gads cleavage products in Jurkat T cells inhibited NFAT activation following TCR cross linking. These findings indicate that cleavage of Gads in vivo could function to alter signalling downstream of the T cell receptor by disrupting cross talk between SLP-76 and LAT."
https://openalex.org/W2114991077,"The molecular mechanism underlying the renal expression localization of the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (TSC) gene was studied. TheTSC gene was localized to chromosome 19p12–14. In cultured cells, tissue-specific transcription activity of the 5′-flanking region of the rat rTSC gene (5′FL/rTSC) was demonstrated, and the major promoter region was located between position −580 and −141. To further examine the tissue-specific transcription, transgenic rats harboring the 5′FL/rTSC fused upstream of the LacZ gene were generated. Immunohistochemical analysis clearly showed that LacZ gene expression was co-localized to distal convoluted tubules (DCT) with TSC, indicating that the 5′FL/rTSC regulates the renal tubule-specific TSC expression. Because a transcription factor, HFH-3 (hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/folk head homologue-3), had also been localized to DCT, a possible role of the putative cis-acting element (HFH-3/rTSC, −400/−387 position) for HFH-3 binding in the tissue-specific transcription was examined. Deletion and mutation analyses suggested that transcription of the HFH-3/rTSC was actually responsive to HFH-3, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed a direct binding of in vitrosynthesized HFH-3 to the HFH-3/rTSC. In conclusion, therTSC gene is localized to rat chromosome 19p12–24. The transcription regulatory region of the TSC gene confers DCT-specific gene expression.

Because a transcription factor, HFH-3 (hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/folk head homologue-3), had also been localized to DCT, a possible role of the putative cis-acting element (HFH-3/rTSC, −400/−387 position) for HFH-3 binding in the tissue-specific transcription was examined. Deletion and mutation analyses suggested that transcription of the HFH-3/rTSC was actually responsive to HFH-3, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed a direct binding of in vitrosynthesized HFH-3 to the HFH-3/rTSC. In conclusion, therTSC gene is localized to rat chromosome 19p12–24. The transcription regulatory region of the TSC gene confers DCT-specific gene expression. DCT-specific transcription factor HFH-3 may be involved in the renal tubule-specific transcription ofTSC gene. thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter human rat hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/folk head homologue-3 distal convoluted tubule reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction fluorescence in situ hybridization electrophoretic mobility shift assay rapid amplification of cDNA ends glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase thymidine kinase luciferase glutathioneS-transferase base pair(s) CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein Thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (TSC)1 is an important molecule for reabsorption of NaCl in the kidney and a target of thiazide diuretics. TSC cDNAs were cloned, and the TSC function was characterized (1Gamba G. Saltzberg S.N. Lombardi M. Miyanoshita A. Lytton J. Hediger M.A. Brenner B.M. Hebert S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutations possibly leading to loss-of-function in the human TSC gene have been shown to cause Gitelman's syndrome, which is characterized by dehydration, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria (4Simon D.B.

Recently, TSC-deficient mice were generated, and their phenotype was shown to bear a good resemblance to Gitelman's syndrome (6Schultheis P.J. Lorenz J.N. Meneton P. Nieman M.L. Riddle T.M.

Thus, TSC plays an important role not only in NaCl metabolism but in acid-base balance and in the metabolism of other electrolytes such as potassium, magnesium, and calcium. TSC mRNA expression has been shown to be localized to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) in the kidney by in situhybridization histochemistry (7Obermuller N. Bernstein P. Velazquez H. Reilly R. Moser D. Ellison D.H. Bachmann S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F900-F910PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bostanjoglo M. Reeves W.B. Reilly R.F. Velazquez H. Robertson N. Litwack G. Morsing P. Dorup J.

Immunohistochemistry using a specific antibody against TSC has also shown that immunoreactive TSC is localized to DCT (10Bachmann S. Velazquez H. Obermuller N. Reilly R.F. Moser D. Ellison D.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2510-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,11Plotkin M.D. Kaplan M.R. Verlander J.W. Lee W.S. Brown D. Poch E. Gullans S.R. Hebert S.C. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 174-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, no study to uncover the molecular mechanism underlying the renal tubule-specific TSC expression has yet been performed in any species. Recently, a transcription factor, hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/folk head homologue-3 (HFH-3), was isolated and partly characterized (12Overdier D.G. Ye H. Peterson R.S. Clevidence D.E. Costa R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13725-13730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HFH-3 belongs to an HFH/winged helix transcription factor family and is identical to FREAC-6 (13Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerböck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Members of the family have been shown to be involved in tissue- or cell-specific gene expression, as well as cellular differentiation during embryonic development (14Lai E.K. Clark K.L. Burley S.K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10421-10423Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 15Kaufmann E. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HFH-3 mRNA was reported to be localized to the epithelium of the DCT, where TSC is also localized. We therefore hypothesized that HFH-3 might be involved in the TSC gene expression. In the present study, we studied the tissue-specific expression of the TSC gene in terms of gene transcription by an in vivoas well as in vitro experiments. The structure of the 5′-flanking region of the rat TSC gene (5′FL/rTSC) was revealed, and the rTSC gene was mapped to chromosome 19p12–14 by FISH. The transcription function was shown to be tissue-specific in cultured cells. Moreover, we generated transgenic rats harboring the 5′FL/rTSC fused upstream of the LacZ gene to examine the tissue-specific transcription of 5′FL/rTSC. Immunohistochemical analysis clearly demonstrated thatLacZ expression was localized to DCT in the transgenic rat kidney, indicating that the 5′FL/rTSC regulates the DCT-specific TSC localization in vivo. Furthermore, we identified a functional HFH-3 binding site in the major promoter region of 5′FL/rTSC, which was actually bound by in vitrosynthesized HFH-3. HFH-3 may be involved at least in part in the DCT-specific expression of TSC. To use as a probe in Southern blot analysis of rTSC gene, an rTSC cDNA fragment was first cloned by a PCR-based method with a rat kidney cDNA library (rat kidney Marathon-ready cDNA,CLONTECH) as a template using a pair of primers (sense, 5′-CCC GGA GCC ATA ATG GCA GAG CTA CCC G-3′ (from position 1 to 28 in previously reported rTSC cDNA (2Gamba G.

The PCR product was then subcloned into pCR-TOPO (Invitrogen) by a TA cloning method. Sequencing was performed to confirm the complete sequence identity with the previously reported rTSC cDNA (2Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M. Lytton J. Lee W.S. Hediger M.A. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17713-17722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The BalI digested fragment of the rTSC cDNA (892 bp) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a random primer method (BcaBEST labeling kit, TaKaRa) and used as a probe. Rat genomic DNA was extracted from liver as described previously (16Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was then digested with restriction enzymesBamHI, EcoRI, or HindIII. Digested DNA was then resolved on a 0.9% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (HyBond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed in Rapid-Hyb Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 65 °C for 2 h with a radiolabeled probe (25 ng). The membrane was then incubated with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 20 min, 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min, and 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. The blot was exposed to an x-ray film (Kodak) for 72 h. Chromosome mapping of the rTSC gene was carried out by FISH based on a previously reported method (17Takeuchi K. Takahashi N. Kato T. Abe T. Taniyama Y. Tsutsumi E. Ito O. Nakagawara K. Abe K. Kidney Int. 1996; 55: S183-S186Google Scholar). At first, three different DNA fragments of the rTSC gene were amplified by PCR with three primer pairs (sense-1, 5′-CCC GGA GCC ATA ATG GCA GAG CTA CCC G-3′ (from position 1 to 28 in previously reported rTSC cDNA (2Gamba G.

The PCR products were labeled with digoxigenin and used as probes in FISH. The 5′FL/rTSC was cloned by a PCR-based method using the Genome Walker Kit (CLONTECH) for rat gene cloning. Briefly, the first PCR was carried out based on the manufacturer's instruction with the gene-specific primer (GSP)-1, 5′-ATG GGT CAA ATG GCT GGG CTG GCT ATT G-3′ (designed to hybridize with the region from position 120 to 147 in rTSC cDNA (2Gamba G.

Nested PCR was then performed with the GSP-2, 5′-TGC ACA GAG CAT CGC CTG GCA TCT CTG T-3′ (designed to anneal to the region from position 31 to 58 in rTSC cDNA (2Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M.

The resultant PCR product was subcloned into pCR-TOPO (Invitrogen), and sequenced in both directions. Putative transcription factor binding sites in 5′FL/rTSC were identified by the TRANSFAC 3.4 data base using Transcription Element Search Software (TESS) (18Schung J. Overton G.C.

Primer extension was performed using the primer extension system-AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega) by a modification of the previously reported method (19Takeuchi K. Alexander R.W. Nakamura Y. Tsujino T. Murphy T.J. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from rat renal cortex by the guanidinium thiocyanate-cesium chloride centrifugation method (16Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. 2nd Ed.

Annealing was carried out with 1 pmol of the primer and 25 µg of total RNA at 50 °C for 8 h, and the extension reaction was performed at 42 °C for 2 h. The extended product was resolved on a 0.8% polyacrylamide gel. To determine the length of the DNA product, the sequence ladder of pBluescript SK(+) (Invitrogen) was also resolved in the same gel. The fluorescent DNA was analyzed by automated DNA analyzer (LI-COR dNA analyzer 4200). 5′-RACE was performed with rat kidney Marathon-ready cDNA (CLONTECH). PCR was carried out according to the manufacturer's instruction with the adapter primer, 5′-GCC ACA CCC ACG GCA TTG GCA AAG GCG A-3′ (supplied in the kit), and an rTSC-specific primer, 5′-CCA TCC TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC-3′ (from position 693 to 720 in rTSC transcript), under the following conditions: 95 °C, 30 s; 68 °C, 2 min, for 30 cycles. The PCR product was then subcloned into pCR-TOPO (Invitrogen) by a TA cloning method. The 5′-end of the rTSC cDNA was determined by sequencing. HEK293 (a human embryonic kidney epitheloid cell line), A10 (a rat vascular smooth muscle cell line), and HepG2 (a human hepatocyte cell line) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. RT-PCR was performed to confirm endogenous expression of TSC mRNA in HEK293, HepG2, or A10 cells using a One-step RNA PCR kit (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Total RNA was extracted from these cells by RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Endogenous hTSC mRNA in HEK293 or HepG2 cells were detected with a pair of primers: sense, 5′-AGG CAG GCA TCG TCC TGA CCT G-3′ (from position 519 to 540 in hTSC cDNA (3Mastroianni N. De Fusco M.

An expression vector of hHFH-3 (pcHFH-3) was synthesized by subcloning the hHFH-3 cDNA into an expression vector, pcDNA1/Amp (Invitrogen). Sequencing was performed to confirm the complete sequence identity to the one reported previously (12Overdier D.G. Ye H. Peterson R.S. Clevidence D.E. Costa R.H. J. Biol.

To examine the transcription activity of 5′FL/rTSC, a chimeric firefly luciferase expression vector containing 5′FL/rTSC (rTSC/Luc) was constructed. 5′FL/rTSC was subcloned into promoter-less firefly luciferase expression vector, PicaGene Basic Vector (Nippon Gene). Deletion mutants of rTSC/Luc were then created with exonuclease III/Mung bean nuclease as described previously (22Takahashi N. Takeuchi K. Sugawara A. Taniyama Y. Kato T. Wilcox C.S. Abe K. Ito S.

A double strand DNA containing the putative HFH-3 binding site located from position −400 to −387 in 5′FL/rTSC (HFH-3/rTSC) was made by annealing oligonucleotides 5′-AGC TAC AGG CTT CCT TTT TGT TAT ATG CAT GTC CT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCG AAG GAC ATG CAT ATA ACA AAA AGG AAG CCT GT-3′ (antisense), in which underlining indicates the putative HFH-3 binding site (consensus sequence DBD TRT TTR YDT D (12Overdier D.G.

The product was then subcloned upstream of a thymidine kinase gene promoter in a luciferase expression vector (HFH-3/rTSC-tk-Luc). An expression vector carrying the mutated HFH-3 binding site (mHFH-3/rTSC-tk-Luc) was also synthesized with oligonucleotides 5′-AGC TAC AGG CTT CCT TGG GGT TAT ATG CAT GTC CT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCG AAG GAC ATG CAT ATA ACC CCA AGG AAG CCT GT-3′ (antisense), in which italic capital letters indicate mutated nucleotides and underlining indicates the putative HFH-3 binding site. The same mutation was also introduced by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) in the −580 rTSC/Luc with oligonucleotides 5′-AAG ACA GGC TTC CTT GGG GTT ATA TGC ATG TCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGA CAT GCA TATAAC CCC AAG GAA GCC TGT CTT-3′ (antisense), in which italic capital letters indicate mutated nucleotides and underlining indicates the putative HFH-3 binding site. The resultant mutated construct was designated −580 (mHFH-3) rTSC/Luc. HEK293, A10, and HepG2 cells were cultured in 6-well culture plates before transfection. Transfection was performed with 2 µg/well of luciferase expression vector as well as 0.5 µg/well control β-galactosidase expression vector (pSV-β-galactosidase control vector, Promega) using DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent (Roche). After the transfection, culture medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% charcoal/resin-stripped fetal bovine serum. 48 h after transfection, luciferase expression was determined by measuring its enzymatic activity using a luciferase assay system (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalized by β-galactosidase expression (determined by its enzymatic activity) as reported previously (23Ikeda Y. Sugawara A. Taniyama Y. Uruno A. Igarashi K. Arima S.

To examine the effect of HFH-3 on the transcription activity of 5′FL/rTSC, pcHFH-3 or mock DNA was co-transfected with −580 rTSC/Luc, −580 (mHFH-3) rTSC/Luc, HFH-3/rTSC-tk-Luc, or mHFH-3/rTSC-tk-/Luc in HepG2 cells, which have been shown to lack HFH-3 expression (12Overdier D.G.

An expression construct to synthesize a fusion protein of the HFH-3 DNA binding domain and glutathione S-transferase (GST) (12Overdier D.G. Ye H. Peterson R.S. Clevidence D.E. Costa R.H. J. Biol.

GST-HFH-3 fusion protein was isolated from Escherichia coli cultures and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purity of GST-HFH-3 was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining (data not shown). The double strand DNA of HFH-3/rTSC was radiolabeled and used as a probe. EMSA was performed with the probe and in vitro synthesized GST-HFH-3 as described previously (23Ikeda Y. Sugawara A.

A double strand DNA containing the consensus HFH-3 binding was created by annealing with oligonucleotides 5′-AGC TGC ACG TTC GTT GTT TAT GTA CCG AGC G-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCG ACG CTC GGT ACA TAA ACA ACG AAC GTG C-3′ (antisense), in which underlining indicates the consensus HFH-3 binding sequence, and was used as a competitor. mHFH-3/rTSC oligonucleotides (containing the mutated HFH-3 binding site) were also used as competitor. The transgene used herein consisted of the 2,110-bp rTSC promoter fused to the LacZ gene. A fragment encoding the rTSC promoter region (−2,110 to +45) was excised from rTSC/Luc with KpnI and subcloned to the KpnI site of pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega). The KpnI site of this plasmid was located 87-bp upstream of the LacZ coding region, and the frame for the intactLacZ gene expression was confirmed by sequencing. The transgene fragment excised by digestion with SalI was purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Transgenic rats were generated using pronuclear microinjection as the standard procedure. The microinjection was performed by YS New Technology Laboratory (Tochigi, Japan). Briefly, the transgene fragment was microinjected to the pronuclei of fertilized single-cell oocytes obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. Embryos that survived microinjection were transferred into the oviduct of pseudo-pregnant Wistar rats. Transgenic rats were selected with amplification of LacZ by PCR from genomic DNA extracted from tails. The number of integrated copies of the transgene was estimated by Southern blotting with the transgene fragment as a probe. The transgenic and nontransgenic rats (16-week) were anesthetized with diethyl ether, and perfused with saline through cannulae inserted into the left ventricles. The kidneys were removed and fixed for 24 h with 20% formaldehyde and mounted onto paraffin blocks. Rabbit anti-β-galactosidase polyclonal antibody (Biogenesis) was used at a dilution of 1:200. Rabbit anti-TSC antibody, a gift from Dr. Steven C. Hebert (11Plotkin M.D. Kaplan M.R. Verlander J.W. Lee W.S. Brown D. Poch E. Gullans S.R. Hebert S.C.

Staining was performed by the avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex method using an RTU Vectastain universal avidin-biotin complex kit (ABC, Vector) and a VIP substrate kit (Vector). Sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin. p < 0.05 by Student'st test was considered statistically significant. A single band was observed in either the BamHI orHindIII digest of rat genomic DNA (∼6.5 and ∼4.2 kilobase pairs in length, respectively), suggesting thatrTSC is a single copy gene (Fig.1). Additionally, two bands in theEcoRI digest suggested the presence of EcoRI site in the intron between TSC exons complementary to the probe. To determine the chromosomal localization of rTSC gene, we next performed FISH using three different DNA fragments of rTSCgene as probes. After hybridization, one hundred metaphases were analyzed by recording the number and position of fluorescent spots on chromosomes. Twin fluorescent spots were identified in eighty three metaphases at chromosome 19, and single fluorescent spot at the same chromosome in twenty metaphases. A typical metaphase showing the presence of twin fluorescent spots at chromosome 19 is shown in Fig.2 A. The position of fluorescent spots were shown in Fig. 2 B, and these spots were clustered at 19p12–14 (p < 0.01).Figure 2Chromosomal localization of therTSC gene.

Twin spots were detected at chromosome 19 in 83 of 100 metaphases, and a single spot was also identified at the same chromosome region in 12 metaphases. These spots are shown to be clustered at 19p12–14 (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A 2.1-kilobase pair fragment of 5′FL/rTSC was isolated and sequenced (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTMdata bases with accession numberAB024534). 5′FL/rTSC (Fig. 3) contains several putative consensus transcription factor recognition sequences such as: a TATA box at 42 bases upstream (−42) of the transcription initiation site; three SRY binding sites (SRY) at position −1,931, −1,728, and −189; five Pit-1 binding sites (Pit-1) at positions −1,486, −1,328, −1,219, −990, and −809; a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family binding site at position −463 and three C/EBPβ binding sites (C/EBPβ) at positions −1,461, −1,118, and −1,011; two SP-1 binding sites (SP-1) at positions −153 and −131; two glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GRE) at positions −1,091 and −579; cAMP-responsive element (CRE) at position −1,021; an AP-2 binding site (AP-2) at position −788; a c-MYC binding site (c-myc) at position −141; and an HFH-3 binding site at position −393. The transcription initiation site of the rTSC gene was determined by both the primer extension method and 5′-RACE. Total RNA extracted from rat renal cortex was reverse transcribed using the 5′-end labeled DNA primer (designed to be a complement to the region from position 21 to 60 of rTSC cDNA). As shown in Fig.4 A, the longest extended product had 67 bases in length, indicating that the transcription initiation site of the rTSC gene is located 8 bases upstream of the 5′-end of the cloned cDNA (2Gamba G.

Moreover, we performed 5′-RACE to confirm further the transcription initiation site. A PCR product 720 bp in length was subcloned, and the 5′-end was determined by sequencing. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the 5′-end was completely identical to the transcription initiation site determined by the primer extension method (Fig.4 C). Luciferase reporter gene assay was performed to examine the transcription activity of 5′FL/rTSC. HE"

Glucuronides, generated in the ER lumen, are subsequently exported from the hepatocytes by conjugate export pumps, which are members of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (Mrp) and the organic anion transport protein (OATP) families (1Cole S.P.

The substrate specificity of Mrp1 and Mrp2 is similar and includes glucuronoconjugates, but the subcellular localization of these transporters is distinct (5Keppler D. Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 787-791PubMed Google Scholar). Mrp1 is localized in the basolateral membrane of polarized cells, such as hepatocytes, whereas Mrp2 exhibits the feature of a multispecific organic anion transporter, acting at the level of the bile canalicular (apical) membrane. Expanding numbers of other transporters for organic anions, including glucuronides, are being identified as shown by the recent characterization of rat Mrp3 (6Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J.

None of the glucuronide transporters identified to date, however, have been shown to be functional in intracellular membranes. Analysis of the topology of UGTs suggests that the bulk of the enzyme protein, in particular the active site, conceptually subdivided into aglycone and donor substrate binding sites, is located in the cisternal lumen of the ER (7Radominska-Pandya A. Czernik P.J. Little J.M. Battaglia E. Mackenzie P.I. Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 817-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Access of the donor substrate UDP-GlcUA to the UGT active site is driven by a carrier-mediated process, which has been functionally characterized (8Hauser S.C. Ziurys J.C. Gollan J. Biochim.

Whereas the putative existence of active transport processes, which reduce the cytoplasmic accumulation of glucuronides has been an area of intense scrutiny, little is known about the initial pathway of these nascent metabolites as they are generated within the lumen of the ER. It is notable that glucuronides are amphipathic compounds, and the glucuronic acid moiety (pKa is ∼3–4) (13Dutton G.J. Glucuronic Acid, Free and Combined. Academic Press, New York and London1966: 464-465Google Scholar) is likely to be in an anionic form when generated in the ER lumen. This observation supports the requirement for a transport process across the ER membrane, as observed in plasma membranes. Of interest is a study by Waddell et al. (14Waddell I.D. Robertson K. Burchell A. Hume R. Burchell B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) using intact microsomes prepared from an infant exhibiting conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which indicated that, when compared with a matched control, bilirubin-glucuronide export from the ER was defective. In contrast, 1-naphthol-glucuronide efflux was unaffected, indicating differential sorting between glucuronoconjugates. A variety of other organic compounds of physiological importance, such as reduced glutathione, dihydroascorbic acid, glucose 6-phosphate, glucose, UDP-sugars, and phosphatidylcholine are also transported across the ER membrane (15Banhegyi G.

Despite the fact that it is a critical step in the overall excretory process of nascent glucuronides, the mechanism of glucuronide transport across the hepatic ER has not been characterized. Here we demonstrate uptake, accumulation, as well as efflux, of radiolabeled estradiol-glucuronide in rat liver microsomes. The data support the concept of membrane transporters of broad substrate specificity in the ER similar to those in the plasma membranes, which are involved in the excretion of glucuronides. 17β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide), [estradiol-6,7-3H(N)] (30–60 Ci/mmol) ([3H]E217βG) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. d-glucuronic acid, reduced glutathione (GSH), 17β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (E217βG), β-estradiol 3-(β-d-glucuronide, β-estradiol 3-sulfate, β-estradiol 3, 17-disulfate, doxorubicin, estrone 3-sulfate, etoposide, l-ascorbic acid 2-sulfate, 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) β-d-glucuronide, p-acetamidophenyl β-d-glucuronide, phenolphthalein β -glucuronide,p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucuronide, S-(p-nitrobenzyl)-glutathione, sulfobromophthalein, UDP-GlcUA (sodium salt), and vinblastine were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (SITS) were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Filtron-X, Ecoscint A and Dimiscint were from National Diagnostics (Manville, NJ). All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade available. Microsomes were prepared from livers of 24 h-fasted male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (220–250 g), as described previously (10Berg C.L. Radominska A. Lester R. Gollan J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 183-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The ER vesicles were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −74 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal.

Vesicle integrity was also confirmed by determination of 4MU-glucuronidating activity of rat liver microsomes; the vesicles were treated for 30 min on ice with digitonin at a detergent to protein ratio of 2 (w/w). A control in which detergent was omitted was run in parallel. Glucuronidation of 4MU (10 μg of microsomal protein) was assayed as described (24Battaglia E. Pritchard M. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. Radominska A. Siest G. Magdalou J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and latency of the enzyme activity was determined on the assumption that maximal activity is achieved in microsomes, which have lost vesicular integrity (25Fulceri R. Banhegyi G. Gamberucci A. Giunti R. Mandl J. Benedetti A. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Untreated microsomal vesicles were 94–96% latent, consistent with mannose-6-phosphatase assay. Purity of the ER vesicles was assessed by measurement of plasma membrane (Na+, K+, and Mg2+-ATPases) and Golgi membrane (ovomucoid galactosyltransferase) marker enzyme activities, as we have reported previously (10Berg C.L.

J. 1994; 302: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) earlier reports of only minor contamination. [3H]E217βG influx was determined at 25 °C using a rapid filtration technique suitable for the detection of internalized radionuclide in rat liver microsomes (vide supra). [3H]E217βG (15–30 mCi/mmol unless otherwise stated) was resuspended in a “cytosol-like” buffer, which consisted of 100 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm NaN3 (pH 7.2) (27Lilly L.B. Gollan J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G1017-G1024PubMed Google Scholar) and was adjusted to the desired final concentration in E217βG indicated in the figures. In some experiments, ATP (1–5 mm) and a creatine phosphate/creatine kinase ATP regenerating system (27Lilly L.B. Gollan J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G1017-G1024PubMed Google Scholar) were included in the incubation medium. Uptake was initiated by the addition of microsomes brought to a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml protein (100-μl final volume). Transport was stopped at indicated times by the addition of 4 ml of ice-cold cytosol-like buffer, followed by immediate filtration (FH225V, Hoeffer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). Filters were additionally washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold cytosol-like buffer, solubilized in 10 ml of Filtron X and counted for radionuclide incorporation in a Beckman LS 5000 TD liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Transport was distinguished from binding (including nonspecific binding), by including in each experiment a control, in which microsomes had been previously treated with the pore-forming reagent alamethicin (0.1 mg/mg microsomal protein) (15Banhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Puskas F. Fulceri R. Mandl J. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2758-2762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Uptake was calculated as the alamethicin-releasable content of the vesicles. Outward flux of internalized [3H]E217βG was studied by first preloading the radionuclide into rat liver microsomes (25 mg of protein/ml) for 15 min under the experimental conditions described for uptake. Preloaded vesicles were then promptly diluted 40-fold in cytosol-like buffer, adjusted to 25 °C or 4 °C, and the remaining internalized radionuclide detected by rapid filtration, as described above, at various times after dilution (see figures). The reversible effect of furosemide and probenecid was evaluated by the addition of these general anion transport inhibitors to the incubation medium containing intact microsomes in cytosol-like buffer, and the initial uptake rate was determined 30 s after the addition of [3H]E217βG at 25 °C. The effect of the transmembrane anion transport inhibitors DIDS and SITS on the uptake of estradiol-glucuronide also was evaluated. The compounds, solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, 2% v/v), were preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C with intact rat liver microsomes (45 mg of protein/ml), prior to 18-fold dilution in cytosol-like buffer at 25 °C, and uptake was measured at 30 s as described above. Uptake was evaluated in the absence of inhibitors (Me2SO alone, 2% v/v) to permit expression of the inhibitory potency as percent of control. To determine the effect of DIDS on the efflux of [3H]E217βG, microsomes were first preloaded with [3H]E217βG for 15 min at room temperature, as described above, followed by incubation in the presence of 5 mm DIDS (inhibition assay) or Me2SO (control) for 10 min at 25 °C. Microsomes were subsequently diluted 40-fold in cytosol-like buffer and time-dependent efflux was immediately determined at 25 °C, as described above. The effect of putative competitive inhibitors was assessed on estradiol-glucuronide uptake at 30 s and 25 °C with addition of each compound at the desired final concentration, as indicated in Table I. All compounds examined in these competition experiments were also assessed for chemiluminescence, but were found not to interfere with scintillation counting.Table ISubstrate specificity of the [3H]E217βG transporter assessed by cis-inhibitory experimentsCompetitorMicrosomal uptake of estradiol-17β-glucuronide (E217βG)0.5 mm2.0 mm% transport without competitord-glucuronic acid101.4 ± 4.7103.5 ± 2.5UDP-GlcUA98.3 ± 8.0105 ± 7.5Sulfobromophthalein51.1 ± 0.327.7 ± 3.0Vinblastine69.0 ± 3.8130.3 ± 9.4β-estradiol 3-β-d-glucuronide76.0 ± 3.065.6 ± 1.5S-(p-nitrobenzyl)-glutathione99.4 ± 11.9106.7 ± 1.0β-estradiol 3-sulfate90.2 ± 15.044.8 ± 4.9β-estradiol 3.17-disulfate76.5 ± 2059.3 ± 7.6p-acetamidophenyl β-d-glucuronide98.5 ± 4.087.3 ± 1.2Etoposide93.7 ± 0.566.3 ± 2.5Glutathione (reduced)102.1 ± 10.7101.9 ± 3.8Estrone 3-sulfate101.9 ± 28.243.1 ± 9.5L-ascorbic acid 2-sulfate109.1 ± 6.497.2 ± 2.3Phenolphthalein β-glucuronide43.2 ± 4.420.1 ± 3.5Doxorubicin88.1 ± 3.797.3 ± 3.14MU-β-d-glucuronide94.9 ± 6.593.5 ± 5.5p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucuronide112.2 ± 4.6119.9 ± 10.8Rat liver microsomes (2.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with 50 μm [3H]E217βG and various potential competitors (0.5 and 2.0 mm) for 30 s at 25 °C.

Open table in a new tab Rat liver microsomes (2.5 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with 50 μm [3H]E217βG and various potential competitors (0.5 and 2.0 mm) for 30 s at 25 °C. Uptake, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was expressed as percentage of control uptake obtained in the absence of inhibitors (Me2SO alone). This control uptake was 0.231 ± 0.024 nmol/min/mg microsomal protein. Values represent mean ± S.E. for three determinations. The effect of changing osmolarity of the incubation medium was studied by measuring the uptake of estradiol-glucuronide after addition of the membrane-impermeant trisaccharide raffinose, under equilibrium conditions. Briefly, incorporation of the radionuclide and time-dependent uptake were determined under the experimental conditions described above. After 11 min incubation, steady-state accumulation of [3H]E217βG was evident, and the intravesicular volume was subsequently reduced by the addition of raffinose (500 mm final concentration, dissolved in cytosol-like buffer). Time-dependent uptake of radionuclide was determined for an additional 15 min after addition of raffinose and compared with that in a control experiment (cytosol-like buffer without raffinose). [3H]E217βG stock solution was analyzed, as described below, by thin-layer chromatography (preadsorbent layer TLC plates, J.T. Baker, Inc, Phillipsburg, NJ) and was found to be >99% pure. Stability of this metabolite under the experimental conditions of transport measurement was determined by incubating 50 μm [3H]E217βG with intact rat liver microsomes in cytosol-like buffer, under the transport conditions described above, and the final volume reduced to 20 μl, using a TLC system, as described (28Radominska A.

At indicated times (0–60 min), 20 μl of ice-cold ethanol was added to the incubation medium, and the tubes were immediately centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a benchtop centrifuge. In addition, 50 μm [3H]E217βG was incubated with 10 units of Escherichia coli β-glucuronidase in cytosol-like buffer for 1 h, mixed with 20 μl of ice-cold ethanol, centrifuged, and loaded on TLC, to provide a positive control for [3H]E217βG hydrolysis by β-glucuronidase. Radiolabeled compounds were detected by autoradiography after 5–8 day exposure. TLC bands were also scraped into vials and mixed in a solution of 0.5 ml of methanol and 5 ml of Ecoscint A (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) prior to counting for radioactivity. Experiments were performed at least in triplicate, with each of the values of a single set of experiments corresponding to the mean of a minimum of 2–3 determinations ± S.E. Mean values were compared using the Student's ttest. As with other glucuronoconjugates, estradiol-glucuronide is enzymatically generated within the lumen of the ER and an outward movement of glucuronides from the ER to the cytosol prior to cytosolic clearance by specific plasma membrane export pumps is currently postulated. In the present studies, we have evaluated both inward and outward flux of intact estradiol-glucuronide in intact rat liver microsomes. Efflux studies were reduced to a limited set of experiments for practical reasons. It is generally accepted that transmembrane solute movement may be studied in both directions, although one particular direction of this movement may be of principal physiological relevance. For instance, the sialic acid uptake process has been studied in rat liver lysosomes, whereas the physiological net flux of this acidic sugar is outwardly directed (30Mancini G.M. de Jonge H.R.

Biol. 2000; 10: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated in intact rat liver microsomes. We first evaluated the internalization of [3H]E217βG into microsomes at 25 °C. Incubation of 50 μm[3H]E217βG with rat liver microsomal vesicles resulted in time-dependent radionuclide uptake and incorporation or membrane binding (Fig.1). Radionuclide incorporation was markedly reduced when microsomes were previously incubated with the pore-forming reagent alamethicin (results not shown), and hence all uptake activities, including those in Fig. 1, were expressed as the difference between total radionuclide incorporation and membrane-bound incorporation detected when the microsomal vesicles were incubated with alamethicin. Initial uptake activity was linear for the first 40 s and achieved equilibrium after 5 min, which was then maintained for a period up to 40 min (Fig. 1 and results not shown). Initial uptake was subsequently determined after 30-s incubation under these experimental conditions. To further characterize the transport process, time-dependent uptake of [3H]E217βG into rat liver microsomes was measured until a steady-state level of accumulation was achieved and the effect of vesicle shrinkage on [3H]E217βG accumulation was evaluated. The membrane-impermeant trisaccharide, raffinose, was added at equilibrium (11 min after initiation of influx), and the results compared with uptake under the same conditions, but in the absence of raffinose. The data shown in Fig. 1 indicate that [3H]E217βG incorporation into microsomal vesicles is reduced with vesicle shrinkage, and hence support the concept of a transport process rather than simple binding of the radionuclide to the membrane. We have previously reported the association of β-glucuronidase activity with rat liver microsomal membranes (32Whiting J.F. Narciso J.P. Chapman V. Ransil B.J. Swank R.T. Gollan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23197-23201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was thus necessary to document the stability of [3H]E217βG under the experimental conditions employed to measure transport. The radionuclide was incubated under the experimental conditions for 0–60 min and possible degradation was analyzed by TLC. The RF of [3H]E217βG and [3H]estradiol was determined by loading pure and β-glucuronidase-treated [3H]E217βG, respectively. Radioanalysis of the migration profile of [3H]E217βG after incubation with intact rat liver microsomes documented that all counts were detected at an RF corresponding to that of intact E217βG (Fig. 2), excluding any possible breakdown of the translocated substrate. To distinguish possible transport activity arising from a minor fraction of plasma membrane vesicles contaminating the ER fraction, we studied the effect of digitonin on uptake activity. Digitonin has been shown to selectively permeabilize plasma membranes at low concentration and to disrupt the integrity of the ER membrane at higher concentration. Incubation of digitonin with a preparation of intact microsomes, under conditions which have been shown to permeabilize the plasma membrane (20 μg of digitonin/mg protein, Ref. 31Banhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), did not exert any effect on the time-dependent uptake of [3H]E217βG (results not shown). As expected, a concentration-dependent decrease in [3H]E217βG uptake was evident at higher digitonin concentrations (Fig. 3). Parallel to this reduction in uptake, we observed a concomitant and progressive activation of 4MU glucuronidation catalyzed by lumen-oriented UGTs (Fig. 3) in accordance with the permeabilization of the microsomal membrane. Microsomes were preloaded with [3H]E217βG, and the kinetics of efflux were determined by rapid filtration. Rapid efflux of [3H]E217βG was observed, with ∼70% of E217βG externalized within 8 s (Fig.4). This rate of efflux was markedly diminished when the experiment was performed at 4 °C. Inclusion of 1–5 mm ATP and an ATP-regenerating system (27Lilly L.B. Gollan J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G1017-G1024PubMed Google Scholar) did not further enhance E217βG uptake or efflux (results not shown). Further characterization of this transport process was achieved by study of the concentration dependence of uptake. Uptake was determined at 30 s for concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 μm. Saturation kinetics were observed and a Lineweaver-Burk plot of the data supported Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent Km andVmax of 3.29 ± 0.58 μm and 0.19 ± 0.02 nmol·min−1·mg−1 protein (Fig. 5). The Kmvalue for E217βG is half that for the rat plasma membrane MRP2 (33Cui Y. Konig J. Buchholz J.K. Spring H. Leier I. Keppler D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 929-937PubMed Google Scholar), about 20-fold lower than that for rat MRP3 (6Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15181-15185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and comparable to that for rat Oatp1 (34Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Stieger B. Hochli M. Landmann L. Tynes R. Meier P.J. Hagenbuch B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1037-G1042PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate specificity of [3H]E217βG transport was analyzed bycis inhibition studies with selected conjugated organic anions, P-glycoprotein, and MRP substrates (TableI). A potent inhibition of the inward flux of [3H]E217βG was observed in the presence of two structurally related anionic compounds, sulfobromophthalein and phenolphthalein-glucuronide. A weak concentration dependent inhibition of uptake was exhibited by β-estradiol-3-glucuronide, etoposide, β-estradiol-3-sulfate, β-estradiol-3,17-disulfate, and estrone-3-sulfate. In contrast, reduced glutathione,S-(p-nitrobenzyl)-glutathione, p-nitrophenol-glucuronide,p-acetamidophenyl-glucuronide, 4-methylumbelliferyl-glucuronide, ascorbic acid 2-sulfate, doxorubicin, UDP-GlcUA, and d-glucuronic acid did not significantly inhibit [3H]E217βG influx. Vinblastine produced significant inhibition at 0.5 mm and weakly enhanced the microsomal uptake of [3H]E217βG at 2 mm. A similar stimulatory effect by"

Several cell lines expressing wild-type p53 protein were treated with increasing concentrations of DNA-damaging drug camptothecin. Lower doses of the drug caused transcriptional activation of p53, but no accumulation of the protein was detected. Only after a certain threshold dose of camptothecin does the amount of the protein rapidly increase and reach its plateau levels. The threshold dose was different for different cell lines, but the general non-linear profile was similar. Increase of p53 level was accompanied by additional transcriptional activation of some p53 target genes (i.e. waf1), but not the others (mdm2). We demonstrate here that transcriptional activation of p53 after the treatment of camptothecin is not sufficient to cause p53-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest. The latter is observable only after the increase of steady-state level of p53. Low drug concentrations, although accompanied by transcriptional activation of p53, do not cause either p53 protein accumulation nor cell cycle arrest at G1. We propose a model for p53 acting as a part of cellular sensor system detecting the severity of DNA damage."

ADP-l-glycero-d-mannoheptose 6-epimerase UDP-galactose 4-epimerase high pressure liquid chromatography ADP-l-glycero-d-mannoheptose 6-epimerase catalyzes the interconversion of ADP-d-glycero-d-mannoheptose and ADP-l-glycero-d-mannoheptose (Fig.1). This epimerization reaction is the last of four enzymatic steps required for the biosynthesis of ADP-l-glycero-d-mannoheptose. ADP-l-glycero-d-mannoheptose is the precursor of the aldoheptose, l-glycero-d-mannoheptose (or heptose), which is a highly conserved component of the lipopolysaccharide core domain among several genera of enteric and nonenteric Gram-negative bacteria (1Coleman Jr., W.G.

In addition, it was observed that one nicotinamide coenzyme was tightly bound to each ADP-hep 6-epimerase subunit; enzymatic analyses suggested that NAD+ was the cofactor used by ADP-hep 6-epimerase (6Ding L. Seto B.L. Ahmed S.A. Coleman Jr., W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24384-24390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59166) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of UGE showed two NAD molecules bound to the dimeric enzyme (8Bauer A.J. Rayment I. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Proteins Struct. Funct.

The conformation of NADP bound to ADP-hep 6-epimerase is less extended than that of NAD bound to UGE as judged by the distance between adenine C6 and C2 of the nicotinamide ring.Here we report that the enzyme ADP-l-glycero-d-mannoheptose 6-epimerase is an NADP+-dependent enzyme. NAD+ can substitute for NADP+, but enzymatic activity is reduced. Several important structural differences between ADP-hep 6-epimerase and UGE give rise to the different cofactor specificities.DISCUSSIONMany dinucleotide-binding proteins specifically require either NAD+ or NADP+ as cofactor, although some of them show a dual specificity (5Bellamacina C.R.

Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Our study provides strong evidence that NADP+ is the natural coenzyme of ADP-hep 6-epimerase, although NAD+ can substitute for NADP+ and still allow the epimerization reaction to proceed at a slower rate. The apparent dissociation constant determined for NADP+ versus that of NAD+ is consistent with preferential binding of NADP to ADP-hep 6-epimerase.Since the 1970s, there has been substantial interest in elucidating the fundamental basis for NAD+/NADP+ specificity of many enzymes. The fingerprint sequence Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly (20Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) has been recognized as the stereotypic hallmark of dinucleotide binding, and therefore it is not surprising that the study of NAD+/NADP+ specificity has focused predominately on this sequence.To investigate the coenzyme preference of ADP-hep 6-epimerase, we have linked the biochemical and molecular modeling studies with information derived from our recent three-dimensional structural analysis. This combined approach has allowed us to (1Coleman Jr., W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1985-1990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) determine kinetic parameters that indicated a preference for NADP by ADP-hep 6-epimerase and (2Coleman Jr., W.G. Chen L.

The structural studies of ADP-l-glycero-d-mannoheptose 6-ADP-hep 6-epimerase indicate that positively charged Lys38 and Lys53 are the major contributors to the electrostatic compensation for the 2′-phosphate group of NADP. The occurrence of these positively charged residues conferred the preference of the enzyme for NADP+. This is consistent with the results of Scrutton et al. (19Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N. Nature. 1990; 343: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that the introduction of positively residues (Arg198 and Arg204) in the NAD+-binding site of E. coli glutathione reductase conferred NADP+ binding preference to the redesigned enzyme. Rizzi et al. (21Rizzi, M., Tonetti, M., Vigevani, P., Sturla, L., Bisso, A., De Flora, A., Bordo, D., and Bolognesi, M. (1998) Structure1453–1465.Google Scholar) reported in a recent structural study of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxyd-mannose epimerase/reductase that in its NADP+-binding site two positively charged residues (Arg12 and Arg36) play important roles in providing electrostatic compensation for the NADP+ ribose 2′-phosphate group.Further, residues (Gly9 and Ile11) present in the Gly-X-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif (21Rizzi, M., Tonetti, M., Vigevani, P., Sturla, L., Bisso, A., De Flora, A., Bordo, D., and Bolognesi, M. (1998) Structure1453–1465.Google Scholar) are positioned near the diphosphate bridge of the ADP-hep 6-epimerase-bound NADP. Residues Ser116, Tyr140, and Lys144, thought to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of ADP-hep 6-epimerase, are located near the nicotinamide ring and its attached ribose. Thus, there exists a significant degree of structural and sequence similarity for the NAD(P)+-binding sites of ADP-hep 6-epimerase and other NAD(P)-binding proteins. Further mutagenesis studies will be used to provide additional insight into the cofactor specificity of ADP-hep 6-epimerase and to determine in more detail the significance of the residues involved.

Residues Ser116, Tyr140, and Lys144, thought to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of ADP-hep 6-epimerase, are located near the nicotinamide ring and its attached ribose. Thus, there exists a significant degree of structural and sequence similarity for the NAD(P)+-binding sites of ADP-hep 6-epimerase and other NAD(P)-binding proteins. Further mutagenesis studies will be used to provide additional insight into the cofactor specificity of ADP-hep 6-epimerase and to determine in more detail the significance of the residues involved. Many dinucleotide-binding proteins specifically require either NAD+ or NADP+ as cofactor, although some of them show a dual specificity (5Bellamacina C.R.

Our study provides strong evidence that NADP+ is the natural coenzyme of ADP-hep 6-epimerase, although NAD+ can substitute for NADP+ and still allow the epimerization reaction to proceed at a slower rate. The apparent dissociation constant determined for NADP+ versus that of NAD+ is consistent with preferential binding of NADP to ADP-hep 6-epimerase. Since the 1970s, there has been substantial interest in elucidating the fundamental basis for NAD+/NADP+ specificity of many enzymes. The fingerprint sequence Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly (20Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) has been recognized as the stereotypic hallmark of dinucleotide binding, and therefore it is not surprising that the study of NAD+/NADP+ specificity has focused predominately on this sequence. To investigate the coenzyme preference of ADP-hep 6-epimerase, we have linked the biochemical and molecular modeling studies with information derived from our recent three-dimensional structural analysis. This combined approach has allowed us to (1Coleman Jr., W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1985-1990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) determine kinetic parameters that indicated a preference for NADP by ADP-hep 6-epimerase and (2Coleman Jr., W.G. Chen L.

The structural studies of ADP-l-glycero-d-mannoheptose 6-ADP-hep 6-epimerase indicate that positively charged Lys38 and Lys53 are the major contributors to the electrostatic compensation for the 2′-phosphate group of NADP. The occurrence of these positively charged residues conferred the preference of the enzyme for NADP+. This is consistent with the results of Scrutton et al. (19Scrutton N.S. Berry A. Perham R.N.

https://openalex.org/W2061409804,"The bacterial final sigma(54) protein associates with core RNA polymerase to form a holoenzyme complex that renders cognate promoters enhancer-dependent. Although unusual in bacteria, enhancer-dependent transcription is the paradigm in eukaryotes. Here we report that a fragment of Escherichia coli final sigma(54) encompassing amino acid residues 29-177 functions as a potent transcriptional activator in yeast when fused to a Gal4 DNA binding domain. Activation by Gal4-final sigma(54) is TATA-dependent and requires the SAGA coactivator complex, suggesting that Gal4-final sigma(54) functions by a normal mechanism of transcriptional activation. Surprisingly, deletion of the AHC1 gene, which encodes a polypeptide unique to the ADA coactivator complex, stimulates Gal4-final sigma(54)-mediated activation and enhances the toxicity of Gal4-final sigma(54). Accordingly, the SAGA and ADA complexes, both of which include Gcn5 as their histone acetyltransferase subunit, exert opposite effects on transcriptional activation by Gal4-final sigma(54). Gal4-final sigma(54) activation and toxicity are also dependent upon specific final sigma(54) residues that are required for activator-responsive promoter melting by final sigma(54) in bacteria, implying that activation is a consequence of final sigma(54)-specific features rather than a structurally fortuitous polypeptide fragment. As such, Gal4-final sigma(54) represents a novel tool with the potential to provide insight into the mechanism by which natural activators function in eukaryotic cells."
