https://openalex.org/W2124474924,"Exosomes are membrane-bound vesicles found in all biological fluids. AML patients' plasma collected at diagnosis contains elevated exosome levels relative to normal donor (ND) plasma. The molecular profile of AML exosomes changes in the course of therapy and may serve as a measure of disease progression or response to therapy. However, plasma contains a mix of exosomes derived from various cell types. To be able to utilize blast-derived exosomes as biomarkers for AML, we have developed an immunoaffinity-based capture method utilizing magnetic microbeads coated with anti-CD34 antibody (Ab). This Ab is specific for CD34, a unique marker of AML blasts. The capture procedure was developed using CD34+ exosomes derived from Kasumi-1 AML cell culture supernatants. The capture capacity of CD34microbeads was shown to linearly correlate with the input exosomes. A 10 uL aliquot of CD34 microbeads was able to capture all of CD34+ exosomes present in 100–1,000 uL of AML plasma. The levels of immunocaptured CD34+ exosomes correlated with the percentages of CD34+ blasts in the AML patients' peripheral blood. The immunocaptured exosomes had a typical cup-shaped morphology by transmission electron microscopy, and their molecular cargo was similar to that of parental blasts. These exosomes were biologically-active. Upon co-incubation with natural killer (NK) cells, captured blast-derived exosomes down-regulated surface NKG2D expression, while non-captured exosomes reduced expression levels of NKp46. Our data provide a proof-of-principle that blast-derived exosomes can be quantitatively recovered from AML patients' plasma, their molecular profile recapitulates that of autologous blasts and they retain the ability to mediate immune suppression. These data suggest that immunocaptured blast-derived exosomes might be useful in diagnosis and/or prognosis of AML in the future."

Distinct T cell subsets, however, adopt metabolic programs specific to support their needs. As CD4 T cells coordinate adaptive immune responses while CD8 T cells become cytotoxic effectors, we compared activation-induced proliferation and metabolic reprogramming of these subsets. Resting CD4 and CD8 T cells were metabolically similar and used a predominantly oxidative metabolism. Following activation CD8 T cells proliferated more rapidly. Stimulation led both CD4 and CD8 T cells to sharply increase glucose metabolism and adopt aerobic glycolysis as a primary metabolic program. Activated CD4 T cells, however, remained more oxidative and had greater maximal respiratory capacity than activated CD8 T cells. CD4 T cells were also associated with greater levels of ROS and increased mitochondrial content, irrespective of the activation context. CD8 cells were better able, however, to oxidize glutamine as an alternative fuel source. The more glycolytic metabolism of activated CD8 T cells correlated with increased capacity for growth and proliferation, along with reduced sensitivity of cell growth to metabolic inhibition. These specific metabolic programs may promote greater growth and proliferation of CD8 T cells and enhance survival in diverse nutrient conditions."

Developing countries account for ∼80% of global cardiovascular (CV) deaths, but contribute a paucity of systematic epidemiological data on CV risk factors. Objective To estimate the prevalence of CV risk factors in rural and urban cohorts attending general practice clinics in the Africa and Middle East (AfME) region. Methods In a cross-sectional epidemiological study, the presence of CV risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus (diabetes), dyslipidemia, obesity, smoking and abdominal obesity) were evaluated in stable adult outpatients attending general practice primary care clinics. A rural population was defined as isolated (>50 km or lack of easy access to commuter transportation) from urban centers. Results 4,378 outpatients were systematically recruited from 94 clinics across 14 AfME countries. Mean age was 46±14 years and 52% of outpatients were female. A high prevalence of dyslipidemia (70%) and abdominal obesity (68%) were observed, followed by hypertension (43%) and diabetes (25%). The vast majority of outpatients (92%) had at least one modifiable CV risk factor, many (74%) had more than one, and half (53%) had 3 or more. These findings were observed in both genders and across urban and rural centers. Among outpatients with pre-existing hypertension or dyslipidemia, many were not at their target blood pressure or LDL-cholesterol goals. Conclusion Cardiovascular risk factors are highly prevalent among relatively young, stable outpatients attending general practice clinics across AfME. The findings support opportunistic screening for CV risk factors whenever outpatients visit a general practitioner and provide an opportunity for early identification and management of CV risk factors, including lifestyle interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2167794347,"The vast majority of the population around the world has always used medicinal plants as first source of health care to fight infectious and non infectious diseases. Most of these medicinal plants may have scientific evidence to be considered in general practice.The aim of this work was to investigate the antioxidant capacities and anti-inflammatory activities of ethanol extracts of leaves of Cassia alata, Eleusine indica, Carica papaya, Eremomastax speciosa and the stem bark of Polyscias fulva, collected in Cameroon.Chemiluminescence was used to analyze the antioxidant activities of plant extracts against hydrogen peroxide or superoxide anion. Comet assays were used to analyze the protection against antioxidant-induced DNA damage induced in white blood cells after treating with hydrogen peroxide. Flow cytometry was used to measure γδ T cells proliferation and anti-inflammatory activity of γδ T cells and of immature dendritic cells (imDC) in the presence of different concentrations of plant extracts.Ethanol extracts showed strong antioxidant properties against both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion. Cassia alata showed the highest antioxidant activity. The effect of plant extracts on γδ T cells and imDC was evidenced by the dose dependent reduction in TNF-α production in the presence of Cassia alata, Carica papaya, Eremomastax speciosa Eleusine indica, and Polyscias fulva. γδ T cells proliferation was affected to the greatest extent by Polyscias fulva.These results clearly show the antioxidant capacity and anti-inflammatory activities of plant extracts collected in Cameroon. These properties of leaves and stem bark extracts may contribute to the value for these plants in traditional medicine and in general medical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2070747002,"Cigarette smoke contains nicotine and toxic chemicals and may cause significant neurochemical and anatomical brain changes. Voxel-based morphometry studies have examined the effects of smoking on the brain by comparing gray matter volume (GMV) in nicotine dependent individuals (NDs) to nonsmoking individuals with inconsistent results. Although sex differences in neural and behavioral features of nicotine dependence are reported, sex differences in regional GMV remain unknown. The current study examined sex differences in GMV in a large sample of 80 NDs (41 males) and 80 healthy controls (41 males) using voxel-based morphometry. Within NDs, we explored whether GMV was correlated with measures of cigarette use and nicotine dependence. High-resolution T1 structural scans were obtained from all participants. Segmentation and registration were performed in SPM8 using the optimized DARTEL approach. Covariates included age and an estimate of total global GMV. Differences were considered significant at p≤0.001, with a whole brain FWE-corrected cluster probability of p<0.025. Among NDs compared to Controls less GMV was observed in the thalamus and bilateral cerebellum and greater GMV was observed in the bilateral putamen and right parahippocampus. Lower thalamic GMV was observed in both female and male NDs compared to Controls. Female NDs also had lower GMV in the left cerebellum and in the ventral medial and orbitofrontal cortices with no areas of greater GMV. Male NDs had lower GMV in bilateral cerebellum and greater GMV in bilateral parahippocampus and left putamen. Within male NDs, GMV in the left putamen was correlated with number of pack years. This study, conducted in a large cohort, contributes to our knowledge of brain morphology in nicotine addiction and provides additional evidence of sex-specific effects on GMV in NDs. Identifying brain vulnerabilities with respect to sex provides a methodological framework for personalized therapies to improve relapse rates for both sexes."
https://openalex.org/W2139306913,"Dynamic thalamic regulation of sensory signals allows the cortex to adjust better to rapidly changing behavioral, physiological and environmental demands. To fulfill this role, thalamic neurons must themselves be subjected to constantly changing modulatory inputs that originate in multiple neurochemical pathways involved in autonomic, affective and cognitive functions. Our overall goal is to define an anatomical framework for conceptualizing how a ‘decision’ is made on whether a trigeminovascular thalamic neuron fires, for how long, and at what frequency. To begin answering this question, we determine which neuropeptides/neurotransmitters are in a position to modulate thalamic trigeminovascular neurons. Using a combination of in-vivo single-unit recording, juxtacellular labeling with tetramethylrhodamine dextran (TMR) and in-vitro immunohistochemistry, we found that thalamic trigeminovascular neurons were surrounded by high density of axons containing biomarkers of glutamate, GABA, dopamine and serotonin; moderate density of axons containing noradrenaline and histamine; low density of axons containing orexin and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH); but not axons containing CGRP, serotonin 1D receptor, oxytocin or vasopressin. In the context of migraine, the findings suggest that the transmission of headache-related nociceptive signals from the thalamus to the cortex may be modulated by opposing forces (i.e., facilitatory, inhibitory) that are governed by continuous adjustments needed to keep physiological, behavioral, cognitive and emotional homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2001541704,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether supplementation with chitosan (COS) could reduce diarrhea and to explore how COS alleviates intestinal inflammation in weaned pigs. Thirty pigs (Duroc×Landrace×Yorkshire, initial BW of 5.65±0.27) weaned at age 21 d were challenged with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli during a preliminary trial period, and then divided into three treatment groups. Pigs in individual pens were fed a corn-soybean meal diet, that contained either 0 (control), 50 mg/kg chlortetracycline, or 300 mg/kg COS for 21 days. The post-weaning diarrhea frequency, calprotectin levels and TLR4 protein expression were decreased (P<0.05) in both the COS and chlortetracycline groups compared with control. Simultaneously, supplemental COS and chlortetracycline had no effect on the mRNA expression of TNF-α in the jejunal mucosa, or on the concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in serum. However, COS supplementation improved (P<0.05) the mRNA expression of IL-1β and IL-6 in the jejunal mucosa. The results indicate that supplementation with COS at 300 mg/kg was effective for alleviating intestinal inflammation and enhancing the cell-mediated immune response. As feed additives, chitosan and chlortetracycline may influence different mechanisms for alleviating inflammation in piglets."
https://openalex.org/W2080105610,"Prior to the implementation of arterial spin labeling (ASL) in clinical multi-center studies, it is important to establish its status quo inter-vendor reproducibility. This study evaluates and compares the intra- and inter-vendor reproducibility of pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) as clinically implemented by GE and Philips.22 healthy volunteers were scanned twice on both a 3T GE and a 3T Philips scanner. The main difference in implementation between the vendors was the readout module: spiral 3D fast spin echo vs. 2D gradient-echo echo-planar imaging respectively. Mean and variation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) were compared for the total gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), and on a voxel-level.Whereas the mean GM CBF of both vendors was almost equal (p = 1.0), the mean WM CBF was significantly different (p<0.01). The inter-vendor GM variation did not differ from the intra-vendor GM variation (p = 0.3 and p = 0.5 for GE and Philips respectively). Spatial inter-vendor CBF and variation differences were observed in several GM regions and in the WM.These results show that total GM CBF-values can be exchanged between vendors. For the inter-vendor comparison of GM regions or WM, these results encourage further standardization of ASL implementation among vendors."
https://openalex.org/W2005996919,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory RNAs frequently dysregulated in disease and following cellular stress. Investigators have described changes in miR-15b expression following exposure to several stress-inducing anticancer agents, including ionizing radiation (IR), etoposide, and hydrogen peroxide. However, the role for miR-15b as a mediator of cellular injury in organs such as the lung has yet to be explored. In this study, we examined miR-15b expression patterns as well as its potential role in DNA damage and repair in the setting of IR exposure. We showed that miR-15b is up-regulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner in human bronchial epithelial cells following IR. miR-15b expression was highest after 2 h of IR and decreased gradually. Survival rates following IR were also higher in miR-15b/16-2-overexpressing cells. Cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and an increased DNA repair response were observed in IR-exposed miR-15b/16-2 stable cells. We observed an up-regulation of components of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/Chek1/p53 pathway in miR-15b/16-2-overexpressing cells after IR. Moreover, a pathway-based PCR expression array of genes demonstrated that miR-15b/16-2 overexpression significantly induced the expression of genes involved in ATM/ataxia telangiectasia and Rad-3-related (ATR) signaling, apoptosis, the cell cycle, and DNA repair pathways. Here we demonstrated a novel biological link between miR-15b and DNA damage and cellular protection in lung cells. We identified Wip1 (PPM1D) as a functional target for miR-15b and determined that miR-15b induction of the DNA damage response is partially dependent upon suppression of Wip1. Our study suggests that miR-15b/Wip1 could be a potential therapeutic target in radiation-induced lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W2027976061,"Understanding the primary effects of anthropogenic activities and natural factors on river water quality is important in the study and efficient management of water resources. In this study, analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Principal component analysis (PCA), Pearson correlations, Multiple regression analysis (MRA) and Redundancy analysis (RDA) were applied as an integrated approach in a GIS environment to explore the temporal and spatial variations in river water quality and to estimate the influence of watershed land use, topography and socio-economic factors on river water quality based on 3 years of water quality monitoring data for the Cao-E River system. The statistical analysis revealed that TN, pH and temperature were generally higher in the rainy season, whereas BOD5, DO and turbidity were higher in the dry season. Spatial variations in river water quality were related to numerous anthropogenic and natural factors. Urban land use was found to be the most important explanatory variable for BOD5, CODMn, TN, DN, NH4+-N, NO3−-N, DO, pH and TP. The animal husbandry output per capita was an important predictor of TP and turbidity, and the gross domestic product per capita largely determined spatial variations in EC. The remaining unexplained variance was related to other factors, such as topography. Our results suggested that pollution control of animal waste discharge in rural settlements, agricultural runoff in cropland, industrial production pollution and domestic pollution in urban and industrial areas were important within the Cao-E River basin. Moreover, the percentage of the total overall river water quality variance explained by an individual variable and/or all environmental variables (according to RDA) can assist in quantitatively identifying the primary factors that control pollution at the watershed scale."
https://openalex.org/W2001470060,"The Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most dreaded pathogens in the hospital setting, and represents a prototype of multi-drug resistant ""superbug"" for which effective therapeutic options are very limited. The identification and characterization of new cellular functions that are essential for P. aeruginosa viability and/or virulence could drive the development of anti-Pseudomonas compounds with novel mechanisms of action. In this study we investigated whether TolB, the periplasmic component of the Tol-Pal trans-envelope protein complex of Gram-negative bacteria, represents a potential drug target in P. aeruginosa. By combining conditional mutagenesis with the analysis of specific pathogenicity-related phenotypes, we demonstrated that TolB is essential for P. aeruginosa growth, both in laboratory and clinical strains, and that TolB-depleted P. aeruginosa cells are strongly defective in cell-envelope integrity, resistance to human serum and several antibiotics, as well as in the ability to cause infection and persist in an insect model of P. aeruginosa infection. The essentiality of TolB for P. aeruginosa growth, resistance and pathogenicity highlights the potential of TolB as a novel molecular target for anti-P. aeruginosa drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2001239421,"Over the past decade rapid advances have occurred in the understanding of RNA expression and its regulation. Quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) have become the gold standard for quantifying gene expression. Microfluidic next generation, high throughput qPCR now permits the detection of transcript copy number in thousands of reactions simultaneously, dramatically increasing the sensitivity over standard qPCR. Here we present a gene expression analysis method applicable to both standard polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) and high throughput qPCR. This technique is adjusted to the input sample quantity (e.g., the number of cells) and is independent of control gene expression. It is efficiency-corrected and with the use of a universal reference sample (commercial complementary DNA (cDNA)) permits the normalization of results between different batches and between different instruments – regardless of potential differences in transcript amplification efficiency. Modifications of the input quantity method include (1) the achievement of absolute quantification and (2) a non-efficiency corrected analysis. When compared to other commonly used algorithms the input quantity method proved to be valid. This method is of particular value for clinical studies of whole blood and circulating leukocytes where cell counts are readily available."
https://openalex.org/W2053690038,"Background In the Systolic Hypertension in Europe trial (NCT02088450), we investigated whether systolic blood pressure variability determines prognosis over and beyond level. Methods Using a computerised random function and a double-blind design, we randomly allocated 4695 patients (≥60 years) with isolated systolic hypertension (160–219/<95 mm Hg) to active treatment or matching placebo. Active treatment consisted of nitrendipine (10–40 mg/day) with possible addition of enalapril (5–20 mg/day) and/or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5–25.0 mg/day). We assessed whether on-treatment systolic blood pressure level (SBP), visit-to-visit variability independent of the mean (VIM) or within-visit variability (WVV) predicted total (n = 286) or cardiovascular (n = 150) mortality or cardiovascular (n = 347), cerebrovascular (n = 133) or cardiac (n = 217) endpoints. Findings At 2 years, mean between-group differences were 10.5 mm Hg (p<0.0001) for SBP, 0.29 units (p = 0.20) for VIM, and 0.07 mm Hg (p = 0.47) for WVV. Active treatment reduced (p≤0.048) cardiovascular (−28%), cerebrovascular (−40%) and cardiac (−24%) endpoints. In analyses dichotomised by the median, patients with low vs. high VIM had similar event rates (p≥0.14). Low vs. high WVV was not associated with event rates (p≥0.095), except for total and cardiovascular mortality on active treatment, which were higher with low WVV (p≤0.0003). In multivariable-adjusted Cox models, SBP predicted all endpoints (p≤0.0043), whereas VIM did not predict any (p≥0.058). Except for an inverse association with total mortality (p = 0.042), WVV was not predictive (p≥0.15). Sensitivity analyses, from which we excluded blood pressure readings within 6 months after randomisation, 6 months prior to an event or both were confirmatory. Conclusions The double-blind placebo-controlled Syst-Eur trial demonstrated that blood-pressure lowering treatment reduces cardiovascular complications by decreasing level but not variability of SBP. Higher blood pressure level, but not higher variability, predicted risk. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02088450"
https://openalex.org/W2103083083,"The Qiangic languages in western Sichuan (WSC) are believed to be the oldest branch of the Sino-Tibetan linguistic family, and therefore, all Sino-Tibetan populations might have originated in WSC. However, very few genetic investigations have been done on Qiangic populations and no genetic evidences for the origin of Sino-Tibetan populations have been provided. By using the informative Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers, we analyzed the genetic structure of Qiangic populations. Our results revealed a predominantly Northern Asian-specific component in Qiangic populations, especially in maternal lineages. The Qiangic populations are an admixture of the northward migrations of East Asian initial settlers with Y chromosome haplogroup D (D1-M15 and the later originated D3a-P47) in the late Paleolithic age, and the southward Di-Qiang people with dominant haplogroup O3a2c1*-M134 and O3a2c1a-M117 in the Neolithic Age."
https://openalex.org/W1994333151,"The development of methods to assemble nucleosomes from recombinant histones decades ago has transformed chromatin research. Nevertheless, nucleosome reconstitution remains time consuming to this day, not least because the four individual histones must be purified first. Here, we present a streamlined purification protocol of recombinant histones from bacteria. We termed this method ""rapid histone purification"" (RHP) as it circumvents isolation of inclusion bodies and thereby cuts out the most time-consuming step of traditional purification protocols. Instead of inclusion body isolation, whole cell extracts are prepared under strongly denaturing conditions that directly solubilize inclusion bodies. By ion exchange chromatography, the histones are purified from the extracts. The protocol has been successfully applied to all four canonical Drosophila and human histones. RHP histones and histones that were purified from isolated inclusion bodies had similar purities. The different purification strategies also did not impact the quality of octamers reconstituted from these histones. We expect that the RHP protocol can be readily applied to the purification of canonical histones from other species as well as the numerous histone variants."

This situation underscores the need to explore the possible causes of febrile episodes in patients presenting with symptoms at the Korogwe District Hospital (KDH). Methods A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted at KDH, north-eastern Tanzania. Patients aged 2 to 59 months presenting at the outpatient department with an acute medical condition and fever (measured axillary temperature ≥37.5°C) were enrolled. Blood samples were examined for malaria parasites, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and bacterial infections. A urine culture was performed in selected cases to test for bacterial infection and a chest radiograph was requested if pneumonia was suspected. Diagnosis was based on both clinical and laboratory investigations. Results A total of 867 patients with a median age of 15.1 months (Interquartile range 8.6–29.9) were enrolled from January 2013 to October 2013. Respiratory tract infections were the leading clinical diagnosis with 406/867 (46.8%) of patients diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection and 130/867 (15.0%) with pneumonia. Gastroenteritis was diagnosed in 184/867 (21.2%) of patients. Malaria infection was confirmed in 72/867 (8.3%) of patients. Bacterial infection in blood and urine accounted for 26/808 (3.2%) infections in the former, and 66/373 (17.7%) infections in the latter. HIV infection was confirmed in 10/824 (1.2%) of patients. Respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis were frequent in patients under 36 months of age (87.3% and 91.3% respectively). Co-infections were seen in 221/867 (25.5%) of patients. The cause of fever was not identified in 65/867 (7.5%) of these patients. Conclusions The different proportions of infections found among febrile children reflect the causes of fever in the study area. These findings indicate the need to optimise patient management by developing malaria and non-malaria febrile illnesses management protocols."

Antimicrobial peptide LL-37 promotes bacterial phagocytosis by human macrophages.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2014; 95: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). LL-37 is known to bind to agonists of multiple TLRs, including lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which can activate TLR4 signaling, and the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that activates TLR3. However, it is not known how LL-37 binding to the TLR agonists will differentially affect signaling. Toll-like receptor double-stranded RNA formyl peptide receptor-like 1 rhodamine-labeled poly(I:C) benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-fluoromethyl ketone EGF receptor 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol reversible cross-linking peptide. One feature that likely contributes to these distinct outcomes in signaling is that TLR4 predominantly signals from the plasma membrane, whereas TLR3 signaling takes place in acidified endosomes (14.Phelps M.A. Foraker A.B. Gao W. Dalton J.T. Swaan P.W. A novel rhodamine-riboflavin conjugate probe exhibits distinct fluorescence resonance energy transfer that enables riboflavin trafficking and subcellular localization studies.Mol. Pharm. 2004; 1: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The antimicrobial activity and the conformation of LL-37 have been documented to be affected by pH, although the previous studies did not examine dsRNA binding or TLR3 signaling (15.Johansson J. Gudmundsson G.H. Rottenberg M.E. Berndt K.D. Agerberth B. Conformation-dependent antibacterial activity of the naturally occurring human peptide LL-37.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3718-3724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). We propose that should LL-37 bind to TLR agonists at neutral pH, but release them under acidic conditions, it could suppress TLR4 signaling by maintaining binding to LPS in the cytoplasm but deliver higher concentrations of dsRNA to endosomes and enhance TLR3 signaling. In this study we document that LL-37 binding to poly(I:C) is dependent upon pH. Upon acidification of endosomes, LL-37 is released from dsRNA both in vitro and in cells. Furthermore, LL-37 is degraded in lysosomes. We also mapped the residues from LL-37 that contact dsRNA and found derivatives of LL-37 that can inhibit LL-37 enhancement of TLR3 signaling but maintain the ability to inhibit TLR4 signaling. The BEAS-2B cell line was from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in BEGM media containing supplements (11.Lai Y. Yi G. Chen A. Bhardwaj K. Tragesser B.J. Rodrigo A.

Viral double-strand RNA-binding proteins can enhance innate immune signaling by toll-like Receptor 3.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e25837Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 59). Proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin (both from Calbiochem) were dissolved in ethanol and DMSO, respectively. Cathepsin inhibitor z-FA-FMK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was dissolved in DMSO. Endosome acidification inhibitors ammonium chloride and chloroquine (Sigma) were dissolved in water. Bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO. Poly(I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were from Invivogen. Reovirus dsRNA S4 was prepared by in vitro transcription as described in Lai et al. (11.Lai Y. Yi G. Chen A. Bhardwaj K. Tragesser B.J. Rodrigo A. Valverde Zlotnick A. Mukhopadhyay S. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Kao C.C. Viral double-strand RNA-binding proteins can enhance innate immune signaling by toll-like Receptor 3.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e25837Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All peptides, including ones with covalently attached fluorophores, were custom-synthesized (AnaSpec) and purified to >95% purity. Antibody to LL-37 (sc-166770) and siRNAs specific to FPRL1 (sc-40123), EGFR (sc-29301), or a nonspecific control siRNA (sc-37007) were all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Fluorescence polarization assays used a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek). All reactions were performed in phosphate buffers adjusted to the desired pH. The polarization measurements were determined as the ratio of the fluorescence intensity parallel to the excitation plane versus the fluorescence intensity perpendicular to the excitation plane. Calculations of polarization were performed using the Gene 5 software (Biotek), and the results were normalized to the starting polarization to account for possible changes in the oligomerization states of fLL-37 as a function of pH. Peptide binding to poly(I:C) used fLL-37 (0.1 µm), a version of LL-37 with an N-terminal carboxyfluorescein. Poly(I:C) was titrated added to a solution of fLL-37 to achieve a final volume of 100 µl. A complementary assay used fluorescein-labeled poly(I:C) (0.1 µm) titrated with peptides to 100-ml reactions that contained final concentrations of 10–500 nm unlabeled peptides. Interactions between LL-37 and other peptides used fLL-37 (0.1 µm) and peptides added to final concentrations of 1–1000 nm. The ability of LL-37 and poly(I:C) to interact within cells was analyzed by monitoring their ability to transfer energy, as measured by FRET assays (17.Sekar R.B. Periasamy A. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy imaging of live cell protein localizations.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Fluorophore-labeled LL-37 and poly(I:C) were added to the cell culture media in the absence or presence of endosome acidification inhibitors and incubated for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and processed for microscopy as reported previously (18.Singh D. Qi R. Jordan J.L. San Mateo L. Kao C.C. The human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, but not the mouse ortholog, mCRAMP, can stimulate signaling by poly(I:C) through a FPRL1-dependent pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 8258-8268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fluorescein was excited with a 488-nm laser, and emission was monitored with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal inverted-base microscope. Data analysis used the Leica LAS AF software. The hydrodynamic radii of LL-37 and other peptides was monitored by a Zetasizer Nano-S instrument (Malvern Instruments). All measurements were taken with 1 µm peptide dissolved in phosphate buffer adjusted to the desired pH at 22 °C. IL-6 production was quantified by ELISA using the OptEIATM kit (BD Biosciences). A typical assay used 2 × 104 BEAS-2B cells/well grown for 24 h in flat-bottom 96-well plates. Poly(I:C) was added to a final concentration of 0.13 µg/ml. Antimicrobial peptides were added to the cell culture medium to a final concentration of 3 µm unless specified otherwise. BEAS-2B cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells per 6-well plate for 6 h before transfection with 30 nm a mixture of three siRNAs. Transfections used Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). The level of target mRNA was analyzed using quantitative real-time-PCR and normalized to the levels of GAPDH mRNA. The sequences of the primers will be made available upon request. Poly(I:C) was added 48 h after siRNA transfection, and IL-6 levels in the culture media were collected 24 h later. Cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips to 60% confluency. After a 1-h incubation with fluorophore-labeled peptides in the absence or presence of poly(I:C), the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS and mounted on glass slides with anti-fade mounting medium and DAPI (Life Technologies), then dried overnight in the dark. Micrographs were acquired with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal inverted-base microscope with a 63× oil objective. Images were analyzed by Leica LAS AF and Image J software. Colocalization of fluorophores was quantified using the Image J plug-in tool JACoP (16.Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. A guided tour into subcellular colocalization analysis in light microscopy.J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3239) Google Scholar). All data shown are the means and ranges for 1 S.E. for a minimal of three independent samples. Data sets were compared using Student's t test calculated with GraphPad Prism 5 software. LL37 was incubated with poly(I:C) at the molar ratios indicated, then cross-linked with the addition of 0.1% formaldehyde. After 15 min, formaldehyde was quenched by the addition of 2 m glycine, and LL37 was digested with 1:20 (w/w) ratio of trypsin overnight. Poly(I:C) was selectively precipitated with lithium chloride along with the covalently cross-linked peptides from LL37 as previously described (19.Vaughan R. Fan B. You J.S. Kao C.C. Identification and functional characterization of the nascent RNA contacting residues of the hepatitis C virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.RNA. 2012; 18: 1541-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Protein-RNA cross-links were reversed by heating the sample for 1 h at 72 °C. The eluted peptides were analyzed using a Bruker Autoflex II MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). BEAS-2B cells were grown to saturation for 1 week. All cells were harvested by centrifugation and subjected to 10 cycles of freezing and thawing. The cell lysates were concentrated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and adjusted to the buffers for the DNA extraction column and eluted as per the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The DNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry. LL-37 accompanies dsRNA to endosomes containing TLR3 (18.Singh D. Qi R. Jordan J.L. San Mateo L. Kao C.C.

Chem. 2013; 288: 8258-8268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether LL-37 will release the dsRNA in endosomes or participate in the signaling-competent TLR3·dsRNA complex. We seek to determine whether LL-37 binding to dsRNA can be affected by pH. A fluorescent polarization assay was performed with fLL-37, which has a 5′ carboxyfluorescein coupled to the N terminus of LL-37 (Fig. 1A; Refs. 11.Lai Y. Yi G. Chen A. Bhardwaj K. Tragesser B.J.

Chem. 2013; 288: 8258-8268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). fLL-37 was previously demonstrated to enhance TLR3 signaling by dsRNA and to suppress TLR4 signaling by LPS (18.Singh D. Qi R. Jordan J.L. San Mateo L. Kao C.C. The human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, but not the mouse ortholog, mCRAMP, can stimulate signaling by poly(I:C) through a FPRL1-dependent pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 8258-8268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In a pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, the fluorescence polarization of fLL-37 increased in a concentration-dependent manner upon the addition of poly(I:C), indicating that the two molecules can interact (Fig. 1B). LL37 binding to poly(I:C) significantly decreased when the pH of the buffer was decreased. fSC37, which has a scrambled order of the residues present in LL-37, did not interact with poly(I:C) titrated into the solution at any of the pH values tested (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that LL-37 can bind poly(I:C) in a pH-dependent manner. We determined whether fLL-37 binding to heteropolymeric dsRNA was dependent on the solution pH. fLL-37 binding to reovirus S4 dsRNA occurred in a concentration-dependent manner at pH 7.4, but binding was markedly decreased at pH 6.4 (data not shown). To allow comparison of the binding, the normalized fluorescence polarization at 10 µm reovirus dsRNA are shown in Fig. 1D. Other polyanionic molecules, including LPS, the sense-strand of the S4 RNA, and also dsDNA were also preferentially bound by fLL-37 at neutral pH values (Fig. 1D). These results show that LL-37 binds anionic polymers in a pH-dependent manner in vitro, although the difference in the relative degree of binding differed for the polyanionic polymers (Fig. 1D). For the remainder of this study, we will use poly(I:C) as a dsRNA ligand for LL-37. The localization of LL-37 complexed with dsRNA to endosomes and to enhance TLR3 activity have been previously characterized (18.Singh D. Qi R. Jordan J.L. San Mateo L. Kao C.C. The human antimicrobial peptide LL-37, but not the mouse ortholog, mCRAMP, can stimulate signaling by poly(I:C) through a FPRL1-dependent pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 8258-8268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether the LL-37·poly(I:C) complex will dissociate in acidified endosomes of BEAS-2B cells, a human lung epithelial cell line that expresses endogenous FPLR-1, a receptor for the LL-37·dsRNA complex and TLR3 (11.Lai Y. Yi G. Chen A. Bhardwaj K. Tragesser B.J. Rodrigo A. Valverde Zlotnick A. Mukhopadhyay S. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Kao C.C. Viral double-strand RNA-binding proteins can enhance innate immune signaling by toll-like Receptor 3.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e25837Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Rhodamine-labeled poly(I:C) (rpIC) and fLL37 form a FRET pair and rpIC was previously shown to activate TLR3 signaling (11.Lai Y. Yi G. Chen A. Bhardwaj K. Tragesser B.J. Rodrigo A. Valverde Zlotnick A. Mukhopadhyay S. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Kao C.C. Viral double-strand RNA-binding proteins can enhance innate immune signaling by toll-like Receptor 3.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e25837Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both fLL-37 and rpIC localized to endosomes (Fig. 2A). However, excitation of the fluorescein-labeled LL-37 did not result in energy transfer and fluorescence of the rhodamine on rpIC (Fig. 2A and 2C). This result suggests that LL-37 and poly(I:C) were no longer in physical contact in endosomes. However, cells treated with either chloroquine or ammonium chloride, or bafilomycin A1 to inhibit endosome acidification before the addition of fLL-37 and rpIC exhibited Förster resonance energy transfer (Fig. 2B, 2C and data not shown). These results suggest that endosome acidification is associated with the dissociation of the LL-37·poly(I:C) complex in cells. Inhibition of endosome acidification also reduced IL-6 production, consistent with endosome acidification being required for the activation of signal transduction by TLR3 (Fig. 2D; Refs. 20.Ranjith-Kumar C.T.

LL-37 forms higher order oligomeric complexes (22.Oren Z. Lerman J.C. Gudmundsson G.H. Agerberth B. Shai Y.

Native oligomerization determines the mode of action and biological activities of human cathelicidin LL-37.Biochem. J. 2014; 457: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We used dynamic light scatter spectroscopy to determine whether pH will affect the oligomerization state of LL-37 in solution. At pH 7.4 the average hydrodynamic radius of LL-37 was ∼1 µm. However, a decrease in the buffer pH resulted in LL-37 dissociating to <10 nm (Fig. 3A). Sc-37 also formed a higher order complex of ∼1 µm, but this complex was not affected by acidification of the buffer (Fig. 3B). Pentamide, which had the five acidic residues in LL-37 replaced with neutral-polar residues, also failed to dissociate from a higher order complex as a function of pH. The results with pentamide suggest that ionic interactions between LL-37 peptides contribute to oligomer formation. To address this we examined whether salt concentrations will affect the hydrodynamic radii of LL-37. The reactions were performed in a pH 7.4 buffer. In solutions with up to 50 mm NaCl, LL-37 was in complexes with hydrodynamic radii of >1000 nm. At ∼100 mm NaCl, complexes of 4–10 nm were observed (Fig. 3C). With NaCl of 200 mm or higher, LL-37 only had a hydrodynamic radii of 2–5 nm. The sensitivity of higher order complexes of LL-37 to salt is consistent with ionic interactions being responsible for the association between LL-37 subunits. To examine whether LL-37 forms higher order oligomers in cells, we used a 1:1 mixture of fLL-37 and rhodamine-labeled LL-37 (rLL-37). When the two peptides were added to the medium of BEAS-2B cells, they co-localized to endosomes within 30 min (Fig. 3D). However, relatively little FRET was observed unless cells were treated with ammonium chloride or chloroquine to inhibit endosome acidification (Fig. 3, D and E). Identical results were observed when the cells were treated with a 1:1 mixture of fLL-37 and rLL-37 added to cell culture media along with poly(I:C) (data not shown). These results suggest that the LL-37·poly(I:C) complex dissociates upon endosome acidification. Acidification of endosomes can activate cathepsins that can cleave TLR3, -7, and -9 and increase signaling (24.Ewald S.E. Engel A. Lee J. Wang M. Bogyo M. Barton G.M.

We examined whether LL-37 would be subject to proteolysis, possibly by cathepsins. BEAS-2B cells were treated with LL-37 in the absence or presence of poly(I:C) for 15 min, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fresh medium. The cells were harvested over time, lysed, and subjected to Western blot analysis. LL-37 accumulation decreased over time, with an estimated half-life of 1 h (Fig. 4, A and B). Cells treated with ammonium chloride or the cathepsin inhibitor Z-FA-FMK had half-lives in excess of 12 h (Fig. 4, A and B). These results suggest that endosome acidification can lead to proteolysis of LL-37. We seek to determine how residues in LL-37 contact poly(I:C) using a reversible cross-linking peptide fingerprinting method (RCAP; Ref. 19.Vaughan R. Fan B. You J.S. Kao C.C. Identification and functional characterization of the nascent RNA contacting residues of the hepatitis C virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.RNA. 2012; 18: 1541-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). RCAP fingerprinting has been used to map the RNA-contacting regions within several protein·RNA complexes using formaldehyde, a bifunctional cross-linking agent that cross-links primary amines that are within 2 Å of each other (26.Lu K. Ye W. Zhou L. Collins L.B. Chen X. Gold A. Ball L.M. Swenberg J.A. Structural characterization of formaldehyde-induced cross-links between amino acids and deoxynucleosides and their oligomers.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 3388-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cross-linked LL-37·poly(I:C) were extensively digested with trypsin to cleave C-terminal of lysines and arginines (Fig. 5A). Poly(I:C) and peptide fragments cross-linked to poly(I:C) were selectively precipitated with lithium chloride. The cross-linked peptides co-purified with poly(I:C) were reversed and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Control reactions performed without formaldehyde did not identify peptides, indicating that the washing conditions are stringent (Fig. 5B). Several peptides derived from LL-37 were observed with the LL-37·poly(I:C) cross-linked complex at both a 1:1 and a 10:1 molar ratio of LL-37 to poly(I:C) fractionated to have an average length of 500 bp. All peptides matched to within 0.5 daltons of the expected LL-37 tryptic fragments (Fig. 5C). Both the N- and C-terminal portions of LL-37 were found to be in contact with poly(I:C), but a higher concentration of peptide resulted in a decreased cross-linking to residues 18, 19, and 23 of LL-37 (Fig. 5C). Overlapping peptides were observed, suggesting that some lysine and arginine residues were only partially cross-linked to poly(I:C), as some sites remained accessible to trypsin cleavage (Fig. 5C). The RCAP fingerprinting assay was also used to map LL-37 interaction with a 100-bp DNA. RCAP fingerprinting has been validated for protein-DNA interaction (27.Pérez-Vargas J. Vaughan R.C. Houser C. Hastie K.M. Kao C.C. Nemerow G.R. Isolation and characterization of the DNA and protein binding activities of adenovirus core protein V.J. Virol. 2014; 88: 9287-9296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Again, the background was minimal, and peptides from LL-37 from the cross-linked samples were easily identified. At a 1:1 molar ration of LL-37 to DNA the N-terminal region of LL-37 also contacted the DNA. In addition, up to residues 29 of LL-37 were observed to be cross-linked to DNA (Fig. 5C) An interesting difference from the cross-link to poly(I:C) is that the middle region of LL-37 appears to be less in contact with DNA when a 10:1 molar ratio of LL-37 and DNA was analyzed. It is possible that stiffness of dsDNA could prevent it from properly adjusting the contacts with LL-37. To better define how residues in LL-37 contribute to function, several variants derived from LL-37 were tested for 1) repression of TLR4 signaling by LPS, 2) enhancement of TLR3 signaling by poly(I:C), and 3) binding to LL-37. Signaling by TLR3 and TLR4 was monitored using ELISA to detect IL-6 secreted into the medium of BEAS-2B cells. N- and C-terminal truncations in LL-37 retained the ability to suppress TLR4 signaling (Table 1). Pentamide, which had all acidic residues in LL-37 replaced with neutral-polar residues, was the only one that failed to suppress TLR4 signaling. These results suggest that multiple regions of LL-37 can interact with LPS to suppress TLR4 signaling.TABLE 1Summary of the activities of LL-37 and variants In contrast, all LL-37 truncations negatively affected TLR3 signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2169075188,"Inherited forms of cataract are a clinically important and genetically heterogeneous cause of visual impairment that usually present at an early age with or without systemic and/or other ocular abnormalities. Here we have identified a new locus for inherited cataract and high-tension glaucoma with variable anterior segment defects, and characterized an underlying mutation in the gene coding for transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member-3 (TRPM3, melastatin-2). Genome-wide linkage analysis mapped the ocular disease locus to the pericentric region of human chromosome 9. Whole exome and custom-target next-generation sequencing detected a heterozygous A-to-G transition in exon-3 of TRPM3 that co-segregated with disease. As a consequence of alternative splicing this missense mutation was predicted to result in the substitution of isoleucine-to-methionine at codon 65 (c.195A>G; p.I65 M) of TRPM3 transcript variant 9, and at codon 8 (c.24A>G; p.I8 M) of a novel TRPM3 transcript variant expressed in human lens. In both transcript variants the I-to-M substitution was predicted in silico to exert damaging effects on protein function. Furthermore, transient expression studies of a recombinant TRPM3-GFP reporter product predicted that the I-to-M substitution introduced an alternative translation start-site located 89 codons upstream from the native initiator methionine found in eight other TRPM3 transcript variants (1-8). Collectively, these studies have provided the first evidence that TRPM3 is associated with inherited ocular disease in humans, and further provide support for the important role of this cation channel in normal eye development."
https://openalex.org/W2057434257,"Annually, tens of millions of first-ever strokes occur in the world; however, currently there is lack of effective and widely applicable pharmacological treatments for stroke patients. Herbal medicines, characterized as multi-constituent, multi-target and multi-effect, have been acknowledged with conspicuous effects in treating stroke, and attract extensive interest of researchers although the mechanism of action is yet unclear. In this work, we introduce an innovative systems-pharmacology method that combines pharmacokinetic prescreening, target fishing and network analysis to decipher the mechanisms of action of 10 herbal medicines like Salvia miltiorrhizae, Ginkgo biloba and Ephedrae herba which are efficient in stroke treatment and prevention. Our systematic analysis results display that, in these anti-stroke herbal medicines, 168 out of 1285 constituents with the favorable pharmacokinetic profiles might be implicated in stroke therapy, and the systematic use of these compounds probably acts through multiple mechanisms to synergistically benefit patients with stroke, which can roughly be classified as preventing ischemic inflammatory response, scavenging free radicals and inhibiting neuronal apoptosis against ischemic cerebral damage, as well as exhibiting lipid-lowering, anti-diabetic, anti-thrombotic and antiplatelet effects to decrease recurrent strokes. Relying on systems biology-based analysis, we speculate that herbal medicines, being characterized as the classical combination therapies, might be not only engaged in multiple mechanisms of action to synergistically improve the stroke outcomes, but also might be participated in reducing the risk factors for recurrent strokes."
https://openalex.org/W1997127801,"Understanding the response of any species to climate change can be challenging. However, in short-lived species the faster turnover of generations may facilitate the examination of responses associated with longer-term environmental change. Octopus tetricus, a commercially important species, has undergone a recent polewards range shift in the coastal waters of south-eastern Australia, thought to be associated with the southerly extension of the warm East Australian Current. At the cooler temperatures of a polewards distribution limit, growth of a species could be slower, potentially leading to a bigger body size and resulting in a slower population turnover, affecting population viability at the extreme of the distribution. Growth rates, body size, and life span of O. tetricus were examined at the leading edge of a polewards range shift in Tasmanian waters (40°S and 147°E) throughout 2011. Octopus tetricus had a relatively small body size and short lifespan of approximately 11 months that, despite cooler temperatures, would allow a high rate of population turnover and may facilitate the population increase necessary for successful establishment in the new extended area of the range. Temperature, food availability and gender appear to influence growth rate. Individuals that hatched during cooler and more productive conditions, but grew during warming conditions, exhibited faster growth rates and reached smaller body sizes than individuals that hatched into warmer waters but grew during cooling conditions. This study suggests that fast growth, small body size and associated rapid population turnover may facilitate the range shift of O. tetricus into Tasmanian waters."
https://openalex.org/W2003795294,"When Geobacter sulfurreducens utilizes an electrode as its electron acceptor, cells embed themselves in a conductive biofilm tens of microns thick. While environmental conditions such as pH or redox potential have been shown to change close to the electrode, less is known about the response of G. sulfurreducens to growth in this biofilm environment. To investigate whether respiratory protein abundance varies with distance from the electrode, antibodies against an outer membrane multiheme cytochrome (OmcB) and cytoplasmic acetate kinase (AckA) were used to determine protein localization in slices spanning ∼25 µm-thick G. sulfurreducens biofilms growing on polished electrodes poised at +0.24 V (vs. Standard Hydrogen Electrode). Slices were immunogold labeled post-fixing, imaged via transmission electron microscopy, and digitally reassembled to create continuous images allowing subcellular location and abundance per cell to be quantified across an entire biofilm. OmcB was predominantly localized on cell membranes, and 3.6-fold more OmcB was detected on cells 10-20 µm distant from the electrode surface compared to inner layers (0-10 µm).

https://openalex.org/W2018544899,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease that predisposes individuals to develop benign neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Due to the lack of information on the molecular mechanism of NF1-associated tumor pathogenesis or biomarkers/therapeutic targets, an effective treatment for NF1 tumors has not been established. In this study, the novel NF1-associated protein, translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), was identified by integrated proteomics and found to be up-regulated via activated MAPK/PI3K-AKT signaling in response to growth factors in NF1-deficient Schwann cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of NF1-associated tumors revealed that the TCTP expression level correlated with tumorigenicity. In NF1-deficient MPNST cells, TCTP protein but not mRNA was down-regulated by NF1 GTPase-activating protein-related domain or MAPK/PI3K inhibitors, and this correlated with suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. mTOR inhibition by rapamycin also down-regulated TCTP protein expression, whereas knockdown or overexpression of TCTP suppressed or activated mTOR signaling, respectively, and affected cell viability. These results suggest that a positive feedback loop between TCTP and mTOR contributes to NF1-associated tumor formation. Last, the anti-tumor effect of artesunate, which binds to and degrades TCTP, was evaluated. Artesunate significantly suppressed the viability of MPNST cells but not normal Schwann cells, and the TCTP level inversely correlated with artesunate sensitivity. Moreover, combinational use of artesunate and rapamycin enhanced the cytotoxic effect on MPNST cells. These findings suggest that TCTP is functionally implicated in the progression of NF1-associated tumors and could serve as a biological target for their therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2041089358,"Anorexia nervosa is a primary psychiatric disorder, with non-negligible rates of mortality and morbidity. Some of the related alterations could participate in a vicious cycle limiting the recovery. Animal models mimicking various physiological alterations related to anorexia nervosa are necessary to provide better strategies of treatment.To explore physiological alterations and recovery in a long-term mouse model mimicking numerous consequences of severe anorexia nervosa.C57Bl/6 female mice were submitted to a separation-based anorexia protocol combining separation and time-restricted feeding for 10 weeks. Thereafter, mice were housed in standard conditions for 10 weeks. Body weight, food intake, body composition, plasma levels of leptin, adiponectin, IGF-1, blood levels of GH, reproductive function and glucose tolerance were followed. Gene expression of several markers of lipid and energy metabolism was assayed in adipose tissues.Mimicking what is observed in anorexia nervosa patients, and despite a food intake close to that of control mice, separation-based anorexia mice displayed marked alterations in body weight, fat mass, lean mass, bone mass acquisition, reproductive function, GH/IGF-1 axis, and leptinemia. mRNA levels of markers of lipogenesis, lipolysis, and the brown-like adipocyte lineage in subcutaneous adipose tissue were also changed. All these alterations were corrected during the recovery phase, except for the hypoleptinemia that persisted despite the full recovery of fat mass.This study strongly supports the separation-based anorexia protocol as a valuable model of long-term negative energy balance state that closely mimics various symptoms observed in anorexia nervosa, including metabolic adaptations. Interestingly, during a recovery phase, mice showed a high capacity to normalize these parameters with the exception of plasma leptin levels. It will be interesting therefore to explore further the central and peripheral effects of the uncorrected hypoleptinemia during recovery from separation-based anorexia."
https://openalex.org/W2004767160,"In a process known as quorum sensing, bacteria use chemicals called autoinducers for cell-cell communication. Population-wide detection of autoinducers enables bacteria to orchestrate collective behaviors. In the animal kingdom detection of chemicals is vital for success in locating food, finding hosts, and avoiding predators. This behavior, termed chemotaxis, is especially well studied in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we demonstrate that the Vibrio cholerae autoinducer (S)-3-hydroxytridecan-4-one, termed CAI-1, influences chemotaxis in C. elegans. C. elegans prefers V. cholerae that produces CAI-1 over a V. cholerae mutant defective for CAI-1 production. The position of the CAI-1 ketone moiety is the key feature driving CAI-1-directed nematode behavior. CAI-1 is detected by the C. elegans amphid sensory neuron AWCON. Laser ablation of the AWCON cell, but not other amphid sensory neurons, abolished chemoattraction to CAI-1.

In the present study we show that C. elegans detects the CAI-1 signal, the same chemical that is used by bacteria to control QS, via the amphid sensory neuron AWCON. We identify specific CAI-1 structural motifs that are required for C. elegans to detect CAI-1. Nematodes were grown at 20 °C on Escherichia coli strain HB101 under well-fed and uncrowded conditions (23.Brenner S. The genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemoattraction assays were performed on square plates containing 10 ml of 1.6% agar, 5 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm calcium chloride, and 1 mm magnesium sulfate (24.Troemel E.R. Kimmel B.E. Bargmann C.I. Reprogramming chemotaxis responses: sensory neurons define olfactory preferences in C. elegans.Cell. 1997; 91: 161-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Plates were divided into six equal sectors labeled A-F. For population assays, 1 µl each of stimulus and 1 µl of 1 m sodium azide were added in two spots in sector A, and 1 µl each of control diluent (DMSO, LB, or ethanol) and 1 µl of 1 m sodium azide were added in two spots in sector F. Adult animals were washed twice with S-Basal buffer (23.Brenner S. The genetics of Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and once with chemotaxis buffer, placed in the center of the assay plate (between sectors C and D) and counted after 1 h. 100–200 worms were assayed per plate, with the exception of the laser ablation studies, in which 15–30 worms were assayed per plate. Each assay was performed in triplicate, with at least three independent experiments. The chemotaxis index was calculated using the formula, CI=(A+B)−(E+F)N(Eq. 1) where A, B, E, and F are the number of animals in plate sectors A, B, E, and F, respectively, N is the total number of animals in all six sectors of the plate. Positive control odorant dilutions were 1:100 (isoamyl alcohol) and 1:200 (benzaldehyde). All chemotactic responses were verified in multiple experiments. All assays were quantified by two independent investigators. Data for chemoattraction assays were compared using unequal two-tailed t tests. Laser ablations were performed on anesthetized early L4 animals (N2 strain) expressing str-2::GFP using a 2-photon microscope. Only one cell in each animal expressed cytoplasmic GFP. Using GFP as a marker for AWCON neurons enabled us to target the str-2::GFP-expressing cell for ablation. Nematodes were anesthetized using 1.5 mm sodium azide. Worms were mounted on an agar mold with ridges to align animals for serial ablations. Ridges were achieved using a vinyl record as a caste. Worms were imaged on a custom-built two-photon scanning microscope (25.Denk W. Strickler J.H. Webb W.W. Two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy.Science. 1990; 248: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (8277) Google Scholar) built around an up-right Olympus BX51. Fluorescence photons were collected through a LUMPlanFl/IR 40×, 0.8NA water immersion objective (Olympus) and detected with high quantum efficiency GaAsP photomultipliers (Hamamatsu). The microscope used ScanImage software (26.Pologruto T.A. Sabatini B.L. Svoboda K. ScanImage: flexible software for operating laser scanning microscopes.Biomed. Eng. Online. 2003; 2: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The laser was administered for 20 pulses at 0.5-ms intervals and 40% power. Images were taken with an excitation wavelength of 920 nm. Successful ablations were marked by diffusion of GFP out of the cell. Animals were allowed to recover on standard NGM plates with E. coli HB101 overnight before assaying for chemotaxis. All worms were verified for target cell gfp expression before behavioral assays. All V. cholerae strains are derivatives of wild-type C6706str (27.Thelin K.H. Taylor R.K.

The chemotaxis response to Compound 2 (Fig. 3, c and d) demonstrates that the hydroxyl group does not influence chemotaxis; therefore, the racemic compounds did not require further purification for individual analysis. C. elegans chemotaxis occurs to a variety of organic compounds as well as to different species of bacteria (30.Bargmann C.I. Chemosensation in C. elegans.WormBook. 2006; : 1-29PubMed Google Scholar). The notion is that chemotaxis toward certain bacterial-derived compounds enables C. elegans to locate food sources, whereas chemotaxis away from noxious bacteria allows C. elegans to avoid danger. Two pathogens, P. aeruginosa and B. nematocida, are more attractive to C. elegans than are harmless laboratory E. coli strains (22.Niu Q. Huang X. Zhang L. Xu J. Yang D. Wei K. Niu X. An Z. Bennett J.W. Zou C. Yang J. Zhang K.-Q. A Trojan horse mechanism of bacterial pathogenesis against nematodes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 16631-16636Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31.Zhang Y. Lu H. Bargmann C.I. Pathogenic bacteria induce aversive olfactory learning in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2005; 438: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In the case of P. aeruginosa, C. elegans is initially attracted to the bacteria but through associative learning subsequently avoids them (31.Zhang Y. Lu H. Bargmann C.I. Pathogenic bacteria induce aversive olfactory learning in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2005; 438: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). It is not understood how C. elegans distinguishes attractive and aversive bacterial-produced cues and translates detection of these chemicals into meaningful behavioral responses. We chose to investigate whether QS AIs are involved in C. elegans chemotactic behavior using the nematode pathogen V. cholerae. We first tested whether C. elegans can distinguish between its standard laboratory food source, E. coli HB101, and V. cholerae using volatile chemotaxis assays (24.Troemel E.R. Kimmel B.E. Bargmann C.I. Reprogramming chemotaxis responses: sensory neurons define olfactory preferences in C. elegans.Cell. 1997; 91: 161-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). C. elegans displayed a preference for V. cholerae over E. coli (C.I. = 0.83, leftmost bar in Fig. 1a) that is comparable to its preference for P. aeruginosa over E. coli (31.Zhang Y. Lu H. Bargmann C.I. Pathogenic bacteria induce aversive olfactory learning in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2005; 438: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Higher level chemoattraction also occurred to V. cholerae cell-free culture fluids compared with those prepared from E. coli HB101 (C.I. = 0.87, leftmost bar in Fig. 1b). We sought to identify the compounds that mediate this potent attraction. Obvious candidates are bacterial AIs. We examined the C. elegans chemotactic response to purified, synthetic AIs with varying chemical structures, including the intragenera Vibrio signal CAI-1, the interspecies AI, AI-2, the intraspecies AI from the related bacterium Vibrio harveyi, N-(3-hydroxybutanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (HAI-1), and the P. aeruginosa intraspecies AI, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (PAI-1) (Fig. 2a, and structures are shown in Fig. 2e). Among these molecules, C. elegans was most potently attracted to CAI-1, had a far weaker response to AI-2, and the response to PAI-1 was insignificant (C.I. = 0.19, S.D. = 0.15). The nematodes were weakly repulsed by HAI-1. With respect to CAI-1, we observed a striking dose-dependent response to the V. cholerae CAI-1 autoinducer: C.I. = 0.39 at 10 µm CAI-1 and C.I. = 0.56 at 100 µm CAI-1 (Fig. 2b). In V. cholerae bacterial cultures, however, 1 µm CAI-1 saturates the QS response (7.Higgins D.A. Pomianek M.E. Kraml C.M. Taylor R.K. Semmelhack M.F. Bassler B.L. The major Vibrio cholerae autoinducer and its role in virulence factor production.Nature. 2007; 450: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), so it was unclear whether chemoattraction to these concentrations of CAI-1 represented a biologically relevant behavior. To address this we adapted the chemotaxis protocol described in Choe et al. (32.Choe A. Chuman T. von Reuss S.H. Dossey A.T. Yim J.J. Ajredini R. Kolawa A.A. Kaplan F. Alborn H.T. Teal P.E.

This assay showed that 1 µm CAI-1 is indeed sufficient for C. elegans attraction, as the worms spent 3 times longer in the CAI-1 region than in the control region (Fig. 2c).FIGURE 2C. elegans detects CAI-1 and CAI-1 variants. a, chemotaxis indices for the V. cholerae AI, CAI-1, the interspecies AI, AI-2, the V. harveyi AI, HAI-1, and the P. aeruginosa AI, PAI-1, all at 100 µm. b, chemotaxis indices at 10, 50, and 100 µm CAI-1. c, 1 µm CAI-1 was applied to one scoring region in an adapted two spot assay (32.Choe A.

To examine whether CAI-1 is the attractant, we assayed chemotaxis to the wild-type V. cholerae strain that produces CAI-1 and compared that to a mutant strain that is incapable of CAI-1 production as well as to the cell-free fluids from the same two strains (V. cholerae cqsA, Fig. 1, a and b, middle bars). In addition, we assayed cultures of and cell-free fluids from E. coli carrying the cqsA gene encoding the CAI-1 synthase (E. coli/PcqsA) and compared those preparations to E. coli carrying the empty vector (Fig. 1, a and b, rightmost bars). We showed previously that introduction of cqsA into recombinant E. coli is sufficient for high level production of CAI-1 (7.Higgins D.A. Pomianek M.E. Kraml C.M. Taylor R.K. Semmelhack M.F.

In all cases C. elegans preferred bacteria that produce CAI-1 to those that do not, and C. elegans preferred fluids collected from bacterial cultures containing CAI-1 compared with those lacking CAI-1. We note, however, that the absence of CAI-1 does not completely eliminate C. elegans attraction to V. cholerae bacterial cultures or cell-free fluids. Therefore, V. cholerae must produce chemoattractants in addition to CAI-1. Previous structure-activity relationship analyses demonstrate that the V. cholerae CAI-1 receptor, CqsS, can be activated by a set of CAI-1 variants (9.Ng W.-L. Perez L.J. Wei Y. Kraml C. Semmelhack M.F. Bassler B.L. Signal production and detection specificity in Vibrio CqsA/CqsS quorum-sensing systems.Mol.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 5575-5580Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We wondered whether C. elegans also recognizes structural variants of CAI-1. To explore this, we tested enamino-CAI-1, a naturally-occurring CAI-1 variant that potently activates CqsS, and we tested phenyl-CAI-1, which is a CqsS antagonist (9.Ng W.-L. Perez L.J. Wei Y. Kraml C. Semmelhack M.F. Bassler B.L. Signal production and detection specificity in Vibrio CqsA/CqsS quorum-sensing systems.Mol.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 5575-5580Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (see the structures in Fig. 2e). C. elegans displayed statistically similar recognition of each molecule (Fig. 2d), suggesting that the head group of the molecule is not playing a role in specifying the structural requirements for chemoattraction. To further examine the specificity of CAI-1 detection by C. elegans, we tested molecules with variations in the carbon tail length. For example, V. cholerae CAI-1 has a 10-carbon tail, whereas V. harveyi produces a CAI-1-type molecule with an 8-carbon side chain, (C8)-CAI-1. In addition to assaying these natural molecules, we synthesized and tested (C9)-CAI-1 and (C11)-CAI-1. Analyses of this series of CAI-1 molecules demonstrate that 9- and 10-carbon chain CAI-1 variants produce the most robust C. elegans chemotactic response (Fig. 3a, molecules shown in Fig. 3b). Specifically, we found the order of chemotactic preference to be: CAI-1 = (C9)-CAI-1 > (C8)-CAI-1 = (C11)-CAI-1. Interestingly, this order of preference for tail length exactly parallels the CqsS receptor preference (9.Ng W.-L. Perez L.J. Wei Y. Kraml C. Semmelhack M.F. Bassler B.L.

To assess the generality of this response to other bacterial signaling molecules containing fatty acid tails, we examined the responses of C. elegans to a series of acylated homoserine lactone AIs. We observed a similar trend within this series of molecules (Fig. 3, a and b). Specifically, a homoserine lactone with a C10 tail induced high-level chemotaxis, whereas molecules with shorter carbon chains resulted in reduced attraction (i.e. (C6)-HSL) or repulsion (i.e. (C4)-HSL). A molecule harboring a longer chain, (C12"

However, the impact of the unfolded protein response (UPR), because of the stress of the endoplasmic reticulum on endodermal specification, is not well addressed. We employed UPR-inducing agents, thapsigargin and tunicamycin, in vitro to induce endodermal differentiation of mouse ESCs. Apart from the endodermal specification of ESCs, Western blotting demonstrated the enhanced phosphorylation of Smad2 and nuclear translocation of β-catenin in ESC-derived cells. The inclusion of the endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor tauroursodeoxycholic acid to the induction cultures prevented the differentiation of ESCs into definitive endodermal cells even when Activin A was supplemented. Also, the addition of the TGF-β inhibitor SB431542 and the Wnt/β-catenin antagonist IWP-2 negated the endodermal differentiation of ESCs mediated by thapsigargin and tunicamycin. These data suggest that the activation of the UPR appears to orchestrate the induction of the definitive endodermal cell fate of ESCs via both the Smad2 and β-catenin signaling pathways.

Whether there are other factors involved in the specification of endodermal cell fate remains elusive. The ER 3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumUPRunfolded protein responseESCES cellmESCmouse ES cellEBembryoid body. provides a unique environment for protein folding, assembly, and modification. Many insults, including disturbances of calcium homeostasis, changes in redox potential, ionic strength, and requirements of protein folding can pose stress to the ER. Upon ER stress, cells elicit a series of adaptive processes, termed UPR, to cope with ER stress to maintain the homoeostasis of the ER. It has been reported that three transmembrane ER proteins can act as sensors of the UPR, namely protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRES1) endonuclease/kinase, and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (14.Hetz C. The unfolded protein response: controlling cell fate decisions under ER stress and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar, 15.Boyce M. Yuan J. Cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum stress: a matter of life or death.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, binding immunoglobulin protein (Bip), which is a key ER chaperone, acts as a master regulator of the UPR and binds to the luminal domain of ER sensors to prevent their activations. Upon ER stress, Bip is released from protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, IRES1, and ATF6, leading to the activation of these UPR signaling pathways. Activated protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase phosphorylates eIF2α, thereby reducing translation initiation and protein synthesis. Activated IRES1 endonuclease/kinase splices the mRNA-encoding X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) to allow the translation of mature XBP-1 protein, which mediates the up-regulation of UPR genes involved in protein folding and proteasome-dependent, ER-associated degradation. The ATF6 transcription factor, which is released from Bip, translocates from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where it is cleaved. The cleaved form of ATF6 then acts as an activated transcription factor to target genes augmenting the capacity of protein folding (15.Boyce M. Yuan J. Cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum stress: a matter of life or death.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In general, the UPR integrates pathways to efficiently process newly synthesized proteins in the ER and activates ER-associated degradation to remove misfolded and excessive proteins to maintain homeostasis of ER. However, excessive and persistent ER stress can induce apoptosis (15.Boyce M. Yuan J.

A majority of studies focus on restoration of the homeostasis of the ER by the UPR and ER stress that may lead to the life or death of cells (15.Boyce M. Yuan J.

However, whether the UPR, because of ER stress, could influence cell fate decisions of the ES cells (ESCs) to become endoderms at the stage of gastrulation is undetermined. In this study, we used mouse ESCs (mESCs) as a differentiation model for early cell lineage specification at the stage of gastrulation. We employed UPR stress-inducing agents, thapsigargin (TG) and tunicamycin (TM), that activate the UPR and found that these molecules enhanced the specification of the definitive endoderm from ESCs by promoting the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and transiently activating Smad2 signaling.

Embryoid bodies (EBs) were formed from ESCs by culturing in ESC medium without leukemia inhibitory factor (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA). For the induction of ESCs into a monolayer of endodermal cells, ESCs were allowed to grow overnight without feeder support in the leukemia inhibitory factor-supplemented ESC medium. The medium was then replaced with freshly prepared serum-reduced differentiation medium of advanced RPMI 1640 enriched with 2% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). UPR-inducing agents, TG and TM, at various concentrations, were added to either EB cultures or endodermal induction cultures. For monolayer culture, cells were allowed to grow with 0.01 µm TG or 0.25 µg/ml TM for 24 h, and then the cultures were further nurtured in the differentiation medium without TG/TM for 24 h or to grow in the presence of 100 ng/ml Activin A for 48 h. For the EB model, EBs were treated with 0.01 µm TG or 0.25 µg/ml TM for 48 h. In the study of TGF-β/Smad signaling, SB431542 at 10 µm was added to the differentiation medium for 1 h prior to TG or TM treatment. IWP-2 (Stemgent, San Diego, CA), which is an inactivator of Wnt production and secretion, at 10 µm was added to the differentiation medium for 1 h before TG or TM treatment to investigate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The GSK-3α/β inhibitor CHIR99021 (Merck Millipore) at 1 µm was added to the differentiation medium for 48 h. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. E14Tg2a ESCs were cultured in differentiation medium supplemented with 0.01 µm TG or 0.25 µg/ml TM for 24 h, and continued to be cultured for 24 h without TG/TM.

The cultures were maintained for 6–12 days in William's E medium further supplemented with 10 ng/ml oncostatin M (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 1 mm dexamethasone, and 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium (Invitrogen). For pancreatic induction, differentiated cells were allowed to grow in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium, and 2 µm retinoic acid (Sigma) for 1 day.

RNA integrity was confirmed by RT-PCR of a ubiquitous mRNA GAPDH. Results were confirmed in at least three separate analyses. SYBR Green-based quantitative RT-PCR (Takara) was performed using an ABI Prism 7900 HT (Applied Biosystems) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The relative expression level of each target gene was calculated by the comparative CT method and was normalized to GAPDH expression. Cells grown on glass slips and 12- and 24-well culture plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS. After three washes, they were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X (Sigma) and then blocked with 10% normal donkey serum. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 3% BSA as follows: IgG or polyclonal goat anti-Sox17 (1:100, R&D Systems), rabbit IgG or polyclonal anti-β-catenin (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit IgG or polyclonal anti-Pdx1 (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology), mouse IgG or anti-CK8 (1: 50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse IgG or anti-albumin (1:100, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). After rinsing with PBS three times, specific cell markers were detected by the corresponding secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 594-conjugaged goat anti-mouse IgG, or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies), at 400-fold dilution in 3% BSA in PBS. Upon completion of washing, cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma). The immunostaining was visualized by using an inverted fluorescence microscope and the corresponding fluorescence filters. Western blot analyses were carried out as previously reported (26.Xu H.M.

The following antibodies raised from rabbit were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology to identify the specific proteins: rabbit anti-Bip, rabbit anti-p-eIF2α and eIF2α, rabbit p-GSK3β and GSK3β rabbit anti-p-Smad2 (Ser465/467) and Smad2, rabbit anti-GAPDH, and rabbit anti-β-catenin. Mouse anti-β-Actin was from Sigma, and Rabbit p21 was from Abcam. For cell phenotype analysis, cultures were dissociated by trypsinization and washed with cold PBS. Having been fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% cold Triton X-100. They were washed and separately stained with IgG or polyclonal goat anti-Sox 17 antibody diluted to 1:50 in PBS with 1% normal bovine serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. After washing twice with PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody diluted in 1% normal bovine serum. Upon completion of washing, labeled cells were resuspended, and at least 105 events were acquired by using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and analyzed using CellQuest Version 3.1 software (BD Biosciences). The background of nonspecific antibody uptake was evaluated by staining in parallel with a FITC-conjugated isotype-matched control antibody. For cell surface staining, cells were dissociated with 0.02% EDTA and incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-E-cadherin mAb (eBioscience). After washing twice, cells were incubated with allophycocyanin-conjugated streptavidin (eBioscience) and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CXCR4 mAb (eBioscience). E14Tg2a ESCs were transfected with 7TFP (7XTcf promoter) from Addgene (27.Fuerer C. Nusse R. Lentiviral vectors to probe and manipulate the Wnt signaling pathway.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e9370Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and selected with puromycin to obtain a wnt-responding ESC line. TG/TM was added to the differentiation medium for 24 h, and then the cells were harvested for luciferase activity analysis. The luciferase activities in the samples were measured using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Data derived from at least three independent experiments are presented as mean ± S.D. unless stated otherwise. The relative mRNA levels were quantified by using the 2−ΔΔCT method and averaged by normalization to GAPDH expression. Statistical significance was tested by Student's t test. SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,) was used, and p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. ER stress affects the expression of many genes and influences cellular differentiations and functions (20.Wu J. Kaufman R.J.

Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that ER stress might simulate the specification of the germ layer at the stage of gastrulation. First, we used ESCs as an in vitro differentiation model. Second, we set up an experimental condition to trigger ER stress, which activates the UPR. We tested the effect of the widely used ER stress-inducing agents TG and TM on 2-day cultures of EBs derived from ESCs. RT-PCR demonstrated that the gene expressions of Bip and XBP-1(s), which is the active isoform of XBP-1 after splicing, were up-regulated in mouse ESC-derived EBs treated with TG and TM in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Both compounds could activate the UPR at low concentrations (TG, 0.01 µm; TM, 0.25 µg/ml) in 2 days. To study the effects of ER stress on the differentiation of ESCs, we differentiated ESCs in an EB model. EBs derived from mouse ESCs were cultured in differentiation medium with the supplement of either TG or TM for 2 days, followed by 4-day culture in the medium with neither supplement. Real-time PCR for the endodermal genes Sox17 and FoxA2 from cultures over the time course revealed a dramatic increase of gene expression in treated cultures compared with control cultures (Fig. 2). In addition, TG and TM also enhanced the expression of primitive endodermal genes, Sox7, Gata4, and Gata6 (Fig. 2A). Conversely, down-regulation of the gene expression of mesodermal T and Flk1, ectodermal Pax6 and Ck18, the epiblast marker Fgf5, and trophectodermal Cdx2 was observed in TG- and TM-treated cultures compared with untreated counterparts, whereas the expression of the pluripotent gene Oct4 became diminished in TG- and TM-treated cultures compared with the control cultures (Fig. 2A). To further observe the effect of TG/TM on the differentiation of EBs, 2-day EBs were allowed to differentiate in TG- or TM-supplemented differentiation medium for 2 days. Real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated a significant increase of endodermal gene expression in cultures with TG and TM compared with the control cultures, whereas T, Flk1, Fgf5, and Cdx2 expressions were remarkably down-regulated (Fig. 2B). In addition, immunofluorescence staining showed that the numbers of Sox17- and FoxA2-positive cells in the cultures treated with TG/TM were notably more than those in the control cultures (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data suggest that ER stress-induced UPR enhances definitive endodermal differentiation and inhibits other germ layer commitments of ESCs in EBs of mouse origin. To further determine whether definitive endoderm differentiation was associated with the UPR, we treated ESCs with Activin A. Mouse ESCs were grown in differentiation medium on a monolayer in the presence of Activin A at a high concentration of 100 ng/ml for 72 h. The gene expression of Bip and XBP-1(s) was up-regulated progressively in the first 36 h, whereas the expressions of the definitive endodermal genes Sox17 and FoxA2 increased steadily up to 72 h (Fig. 3A). These findings suggest that the definitive endodermal lineage commitment of ESCs might be associated with the UPR. To confirm whether ER stress promotes definitive endoderm differentiation, we adopted a monolayer culture differentiation model. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that for gene expression on monolayer cultures of ESCs, which grew in the presence of TG/TM or Activin A, displayed a significant up-regulation of the definitive endodermal genes Sox17 and FoxA2 compared to those of control cultures (Fig. 3B) or the EB cultures in the presence of ER stress (Fig. 2). Therefore, monolayer ES cultures, rather than EB cultures were used in the subsequent experiments. In contrast, there was a down-regulation of the T, Flk1, Zic, Fgf5, and Cdx2 genes in cells treated with TG/TM (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescence staining revealed that stronger green fluorescent signals were observed in 24-h TG- or TM-treated monolayer ESC cultures as compared to those in the control cultures, confirming the up-regulated expression of the Sox17 gene by real-time PCR (Fig. 3C). The numbers of Sox17-positive cells in TG- or TM-treated monolayer cultures quantified by flow cytometry were significantly more than those in control cultures (Fig. 3D). It should be pointed out that Sox17 is not only expressed in the definitive endoderm, but also expressed in the visceral endoderm, which will form an extraembryonic yolk sac (30.Gardner R.L. Investigation of cell lineage and differentiation in the extraembryonic endoderm of the mouse embryo.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1982; 68: 175-198PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Wells J.M. Melton D.A.

Apoptosis of myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T lymphocytes correlates with reduced rates of disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). We extensively analyzed the Tim-3/Gal-9/Bat3 pathway in 87 patients with a diagnosis of stable relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), or benign MS (BEMS), as well as in 40 healthy control (HC) subjects. Results showed that MBP-specific CD4+Tim-3+, CD4+/Gal-9+, and CD4+/Tim-3+/AV+ (apoptotic) T lymphocytes were augmented in the BEMS group, whereas CD4+/Bat3+ and CD8+/Bat3+ T lymphocytes were increased and CD4+/Tim-3+/AV+ T cells were reduced in the PPMS group (>2 fold and P<0.05 in all cases). Blocking the Tim-3/Gal-9 interaction with specific mAb reduced T-lymphocyte apoptosis and augmented production of IFNγ and IL-17 in the BEMS, RRMS, and HC groups, but not in the PPMS group. The Tim-3/Gal-9 interaction favors apoptosis of MBP-specific T lymphocytes in BEMS; this process is reduced in PPMS by the up-regulation of Bat3. Therapeutic interventions aimed at silencing Bat3 could be beneficial in MS.—Saresella, M., Piancone, F., Marventano, I., La Rosa, F., Tortorella, P., Caputo, D., Rovaris, M., Clerici, M., A role for the TIM-3/GAL-9/BAT3 pathway in determining the clinical phenotype of multiple sclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W2090209691,"Transverse myelitis (TM) is associated with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Early recognition of useful parameters may be helpful to distinguish their difference. This retrospective study analyzed thyroid parameters from 243 serum samples (relapse = 128; remission = 115) of 178 patients with demyelinating diseases (NMO, n = 25; TM, n = 48; MS, n = 105). The relationship between thyroid and clinical parameters was analyzed. Patients with NMO and TM had a higher frequency of abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TG-Ab), and antithyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) than MS patients (p<0.05). The level of TSH and TG-Ab returned to normal levels after administration of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (p<0.05). In 96 patients (NMO, n = 19; TM, n = 25; MS, n = 52) without treatment, serum levels of TSH, TG-Ab and TPO-Ab were significantly different between patients with and without myelitis (p<0.01). Patients positive for aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies showed higher abnormalities of TSH (p = 0.001), TG-Ab (p = 0.004) and TPO-Ab (p<0.0001) levels than AQP4 antibodies negative patients. Logistic regression analyses revealed independent relationships between TSH (odds ratio [OR] = 33.994; p<0.0001), TG-Ab (OR = 7.703; p = 0.017) and myelitis occurrence in 96 patients at the active stage. In 52 MS patients experiencing their first attack, MS patients with myelitis were associated with TSH abnormalities (OR = 42.778; p<0.0001). This study showed increased abnormalities of thyroid parameters in patients with NMO and TM than in MS patients. MS patients with myelitis also had greater TSH abnormality than in MS patients without myelitis. Abnormal TSH and TG-Ab were independently associated with myelitis occurrence in central nervous system demyelinating disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2154433020,"Even though combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) dramatically improves patient survival, they remain at a higher risk of being afflicted with non-infectious complications such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). This increased risk is linked to persistent inflammation and chronic immune activation. In this study, we assessed whether this complication is related to HIV-derived ssRNAs inducing in macrophages increases in TNFα release through TLR8 activation leading to foam cell formation. HIV ssRNAs induced foam cell formation in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in a dose-dependent manner. This response was reduced when either endocytosis or endosomal acidification was inhibited by dynasore or chloroquine, respectively. Using a flow cytometry FRET assay, we demonstrated that ssRNAs bind to TLR8 in HEK cells. In MDMs, ssRNAs triggered a TLR8-mediated inflammatory response that ultimately lead to foam cell formation. Targeted silencing of the TLR8 and MYD88 genes reduced foam cell formation. Furthermore, foam cell formation induced by these ssRNAs was blocked by an anti-TNFα neutralizing antibody. Taken together in MDMs, HIV ssRNAs are internalized; bind TLR8 in the endosome followed by endosomal acidification. TLR8 signaling then triggers TNFα release and ultimately leads to foam cell formation. As this response was inhibited by a blocking anti-TNFα antibody, drug targeting HIV ssRNA-driven TLR8 activation may serve as a potential therapeutic target to reduce chronic immune activation and inflammation leading to CVD in HIV+ patients."
https://openalex.org/W1987815989,"Oncogenic mutational analysis provides predictive guidance for therapeutics such as anti-EGFR antibodies, but it is successful only for a subset of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.A comprehensive molecular profiling of 120 CRC patients, including 116 primary, 15 liver metastasis, and 1 peritoneal seeding tissue samples was performed to identify the relationship between v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) WT and mutant CRC tumors and clinical outcomes. This included determination of the protein activation patterns of human epidermal receptor 1 (HER1), HER2, HER3, c-MET, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Src homology 2 domain containing (Shc), protein kinase B (AKT), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinases using multiplexed collaborative enzyme enhanced reactive (CEER) immunoassay.KRAS WT and mutated CRCs were not different with respect to the expression of the various signaling molecules. Poor prognosis in terms of early relapse (<2 years) and shorter disease-free survival (DFS) correlated with enhanced activation of PI3K signaling relative to the HER kinase pathway signaling, but not with the KRAS mutational status. KRAS WT CRCs were identified as a mixed prognosis population depending on their level of PI3K signaling. KRAS WT CRCs with high HER1/c-MET index ratio demonstrated a better DFS post-surgery. c-MET and IGF1R activities relative to HER axis activity were considerably higher in early relapse CRCs, suggesting a role for these alternative receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in driving high PI3K signaling.The presented data subclassified CRCs based on their activated signaling pathways and identify a role for c-MET and IGF1R-driven PI3K signaling in CRCs, which is superior to KRAS mutational tests alone. The results from this study can be utilized to identify aggressive CRCs, explain failure of currently approved therapeutics in specific CRC subsets, and, most importantly, generate hypotheses for pathway-guided therapeutic strategies that can be tested clinically."
https://openalex.org/W2025285433,"Many proteins are transported across lipid membranes by protein translocation systems in living cells. The twin-arginine transport (Tat) system identified in bacteria and plant chloroplasts is a unique system that transports proteins across membranes in their fully-folded states. Up to date, the detailed molecular mechanism of this process remains largely unclear. The Escherichia coli Tat system consists of three essential transmembrane proteins: TatA, TatB and TatC. Among them, TatB and TatC form a tight complex and function in substrate recognition. The major component TatA contains a single transmembrane helix followed by an amphipathic helix, and is suggested to form the translocation pore via self-oligomerization. Since the TatA oligomer has to accommodate substrate proteins of various sizes and shapes, the process of its assembly stands essential for understanding the translocation mechanism. A structure model of TatA oligomer was recently proposed based on NMR and EPR observations, revealing contacts between the transmembrane helices from adjacent subunits. Herein we report the construction and stabilization of a dimeric TatA, as well as the structure determination by solution NMR spectroscopy. In addition to more extensive inter-subunit contacts between the transmembrane helices, we were also able to observe interactions between neighbouring amphipathic helices. The side-by-side packing of the amphipathic helices extends the solvent-exposed hydrophilic surface of the protein, which might be favourable for interactions with substrate proteins. The dimeric TatA structure offers more detailed information of TatA oligomeric interface and provides new insights on Tat translocation mechanism."

Materials and Methods Kinetics of blood clearance and hepatic accumulation were recorded in young adult male 01b74 athymic nude mice by dynamic T2* weighted MRI after the injection of different doses of SPIO nanoparticles (0.5, 3 or 10 mg Fe/kg). Association parameter, Kin, dissociation parameter, Kout, and elimination constant, Ke, derived from dynamic data with two-compartment model, were used to describe active binding to Kupffer cells and extrahepatic clearance. The clodrosome and liposome were utilized to deplete macrophages and block the RES function to evaluate the capability of the kinetic parameters for investigation of macrophage function and density. Results The two-compartment model provided a good description for all data and showed a low sum squared residual for all mice (0.27±0.03). A lower Kin, a lower Kout and a lower Ke were found after clodrosome treatment, whereas a lower Kin, a higher Kout and a lower Ke were observed after liposome treatment in comparison to saline treatment (P<0.005).

In this study, thyroid histology, plasma TH levels, and iodothyronine deiodinase (IDs, including ID1, ID2, and ID3) gene expression patterns were examined in juvenile Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) following 25- and 50- day waterborne exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of a commercial PCB mixture, Aroclor 1254 (10, 100, and 1000 ng/L) with two-thirds of the test solutions renewed daily. The results showed that exposure to Aroclor 1254 for 50 d increased follicular cell height, colloid depletion, and hyperplasia. In particular, hypothyroidism, which was induced by the administration of 1000 ng/L Aroclor 1254, significantly decreased plasma TT4, TT3, and FT3 levels. Profiles of the changes in mRNA expression levels of IDs were observed in the liver and kidney after 25 and 50 d PCB exposure, which might be associated with a reduction in plasma THs levels. The expression level of ID2 mRNA in the liver exhibited a dose-dependent increase, indicating that this ID isotype might serve as sensitive and stable indicator for thyroid-disrupting chemical (TDC) exposure. Overall, our study confirmed that environmentally relevant concentrations of Aroclor 1254 cause significant thyroid disruption, with juvenile Japanese flounder being suitable candidates for use in TDC studies."
https://openalex.org/W2017513342,"The global spread of anti-microbial resistance requires urgent attention, and diverse alternative strategies have been suggested to address this public health concern. Host-directed immunomodulatory therapies represent one approach that could reduce selection for resistant bacterial strains. Recently, the small molecule deubiquitinase inhibitor WP1130 was reported as a potential anti-infective drug against important human food-borne pathogens, notably Listeria monocytogenes and noroviruses. Utilization of WP1130 itself is limited due to poor solubility, but given the potential of this new compound, we initiated an iterative rational design approach to synthesize new derivatives with increased solubility that retained anti-infective activity. Here, we test a small library of novel synthetic molecules based on the structure of the parent compound, WP1130, for anti-infective activity in vitro. Our studies identify a promising candidate, compound 9, which reduced intracellular growth of L. monocytogenes at concentrations that caused minimal cellular toxicity. Compound 9 itself had no bactericidal activity and only modestly slowed Listeria growth rate in liquid broth culture, suggesting that this drug acts as an anti-infective compound by modulating host-cell function. Moreover, this new compound also showed anti-infective activity against murine norovirus (MNV-1) and human norovirus, using the Norwalk virus replicon system. This small molecule inhibitor may provide a chemical platform for further development of therapeutic deubiquitinase inhibitors with broad-spectrum anti-infective activity."
https://openalex.org/W2086549094,"Background We aimed to determine the effects of treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin on bacterial infections in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia (HGG) after lung transplantation. Methods We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-period crossover trial of immune globulin intravenous (IVIG), 10% Purified (Gamunex, Bayer, Elkhart, IN) monthly in eleven adults who had undergone lung transplantation more than three months previously. We randomized study participants to three doses of IVIG (or 0.1% albumin solution (placebo)) given four weeks apart followed by a twelve week washout and then three doses of placebo (or IVIG). The primary outcome was the number of bacterial infections within each treatment period. Results IVIG had no effect on the number of bacterial infections during the treatment period (3 during IVIG and 1 during placebo; odds ratio 3.5, 95% confidence interval 0.4 to 27.6, p = 0.24). There were no effects on other infections, use of antibiotics, or lung function. IVIG significantly increased trough IgG levels at all time points (least square means, 765.3 mg/dl during IVIG and 486.3 mg/dl during placebo, p<0.001). Four serious adverse events (resulting in hospitalization) occurred during the treatment periods (3 during active treatment and 1 during the placebo period, p = 0.37). Chills, flushing, and nausea occurred during one infusion of IVIG. Conclusions Treatment with IVIG did not reduce the short-term risk of bacterial infection in patients with HGG after lung transplantation. The clinical efficacy of immunoglobulin supplementation in HGG related to lung transplantation over the long term or with recurrent infections is unknown.

To investigate the effects of fluoride on ameloblasts, A/J mice were given 50 ppm sodium fluoride in drinking water for four weeks, resulting serum fluoride levels of 4.5 µM, a four-fold increase over control mice with no fluoride added to drinking water. MicroCT analyses showed delayed and incomplete mineralization of fluorosed incisor enamel as compared to control enamel. A microarray analysis of secretory and maturation stage ameloblasts microdissected from control and fluorosed mouse incisors showed that genes clustered with Mmp20 appeared to be less downregulated in maturation stage ameloblasts of fluorosed incisors as compared to control maturation ameloblasts. One of these Mmp20 co-regulated genes was the global chromatin organizer, special AT-rich sequence-binding protein-1 (SATB1). Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased SATB1 protein present in fluorosed ameloblasts compared to controls. In vitro, exposure of human ameloblast-lineage cells to micromolar levels of both NaF and AlF3 led to a significantly increase in SATB1 protein content, but not levels of Satb1 mRNA, suggesting a fluoride-induced mechanism protecting SABT1 from degradation. Consistent with this possibility, we used immunohistochemistry and Western blot to show that fluoride exposed ameloblasts had increased phosphorylated PKCα both in vivo and in vitro. This kinase is known to phosphorylate SATB1, and phosphorylation is known to protect SATB1 from degradation by caspase-6. In addition, production of cellular diacylglycerol (DAG) was significantly increased in fluorosed ameloblasts, suggesting that the increased phosphorylation of SATB1 may be related to an effect of fluoride to enhance Gαq activity of secretory ameloblasts."

This study evaluated blood pressure and hypertension in women who reported a prior preterm or small-for-gestational-age (SGA) LBW delivery in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2006 (n = 6,307). This study also aimed to explore if race/ethnicity, menopause status, and years since last pregnancy modified the above associations. A total of 3,239 white, 1,350 black, and 1,718 Hispanics were assessed. Linear regression models were used to evaluate blood pressure by birth characteristics (preterm-LBW, SGA-LBW, and birthweight ≥2,500). Logistic regression models estimated the odds ratios (OR) of hypertension among women who reported a preterm-LBW or SGA-LBW delivery compared with women who reported an infant with birthweight ≥2,500 at delivery. Overall, there was a positive association between a preterm-LBW delivery and hypertension (adjusted OR = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02–1.90). Prior SGA-LBW also increased the odds of hypertension, but the estimate did not reach statistical significance (adjusted OR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.76–1.92). Race/ethnicity modified the above associations. Only black women had increased risk of hypertension following SGA-LBW delivery (adjusted OR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.12–3.90). Black women were at marginally increased risk of hypertension after delivery of a preterm-LBW (adjusted OR = 1.49, 95% CI 0.93–2.38). Whites and Hispanics had increased, but not statistically significant, risk of hypertension after a preterm-LBW (whites: adjusted OR = 1.39, 95% CI 0.92–2.10; Hispanics: adjusted OR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.62–2.38). Stratified analysis indicated that the associations were stronger among women who were premenopausal and whose last pregnancy were more recent. The current study suggests that in a representative United States population, women with a history of preterm- or SGA-LBW deliveries have increased odds of hypertension and this risk appears to be higher for black women and younger women."

Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1 is known to be a negative regulator in the IL-4α/STAT-6 signaling pathway of the lung. However, the role of SHP-1 enzyme and its functional relationship with Th2 and Th1 cytokines are not known in the nasal airway. In this study, we aimed to study the nasal inflammation as a result of SHP-1 deficiency in viable motheaten (mev) mice and to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved. Cytology, histology, and expression of cytokines and chemokines were analyzed to define the nature of the nasal inflammation. Targeted gene depletion of Th1 (IFN-γ) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-13) cytokines was used to identify the critical pathways involved. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were studied to demonstrate the clearance mechanism of recruited inflammatory cells into the nasal airway. We showed here that mev mice had a spontaneous allergic rhinitis-like inflammation with eosinophilia, mucus metaplasia, up-regulation of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13), chemokines (eotaxin), and MMPs. All of these inflammatory mediators were clearly counter-regulated by Th2 and Th1 cytokines. Deletion of IFN-γ gene induced a strong Th2-skewed inflammation with transepithelial migration of the inflammatory cells. These findings suggest that SHP-1 enzyme and Th2/Th1 paradigm may play a critical role in the maintenance of nasal immune homeostasis and in the regulation of allergic rhinitis."
https://openalex.org/W2149431835,"Large-scale patterns of species richness and their causes are still poorly understood for most terrestrial invertebrates, although invertebrates can add important insights into the mechanisms that generate regional and global biodiversity patterns. Here we explore the general plausibility of the climate-based ""water-energy dynamics"" hypothesis using the latitudinal pattern of land-snail species richness across extensive topographically homogeneous lowlands of northern Eurasia. We established a 1480-km long latitudinal transect across the Western Siberian Plain (Russia) from the Russia-Kazakhstan border (54.5°N) to the Arctic Ocean (67.5°N), crossing eight latitudinal vegetation zones: steppe, forest-steppe, subtaiga, southern, middle and northern taiga, forest-tundra, and tundra. We sampled snails in forests and open habitats each half-degree of latitude and used generalized linear models to relate snail species richness to climatic variables and soil calcium content measured in situ. Contrary to the classical prediction of latitudinal biodiversity decrease, we found a striking unimodal pattern of snail species richness peaking in the subtaiga and southern-taiga zones between 57 and 59°N. The main south-to-north interchange of the two principal diversity constraints, i.e. drought stress vs. cold stress, explained most of the variance in the latitudinal diversity pattern. Water balance, calculated as annual precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration, was a single variable that could explain 81.7% of the variance in species richness. Our data suggest that the ""water-energy dynamics"" hypothesis can apply not only at the global scale but also at subcontinental scales of higher latitudes, as water availability was found to be the primary limiting factor also in this extratropical region with summer-warm and dry climate. A narrow zone with a sharp south-to-north switch in the two main diversity constraints seems to constitute the dominant and general pattern of terrestrial diversity across a large part of northern Eurasia, resulting in a subcontinental diversity hotspot of various taxa in this zone."

Ten dominantly inherited neurodegenerative polyglutamine pathologies, including Huntington disease (HD), 3The abbreviations used are: HDHuntington diseasepoylQpolyglutaminepolyPpolyprolineHtt51QHuntingtin exon I with 51 glutaminesHRVhuman rhinovirus. are linked to an expansion of the CAG repeat encoding a polyglutamine stretch (polyQ) in the disease protein, with a strong repeat length dependence of disease risk and age of onset (1.De Los Rios P. Hafner M. Pastore A. Explaining the length threshold of polyglutamine aggregation.J. Phys. Condens. Matter. 2012; 24: 244105Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Large polyQ-rich inclusions are detected in patient brains, and cell and animal models suggest the involvement of polyQ aggregation in disease pathology (2.Ross C.A.

Mature end aggregates are considered rather benign, although when directed to the cell nucleus, they also exert a strong toxic effect (7.Yang W. Dunlap J.R. Andrews R.B. Wetzel R.

Thus, to develop drug design-based strategies to alter aggregation pathway and alleviate toxicity, knowledge of the structure and aggregate architecture is crucial. However, despite these efforts, the overall structure of various aggregates remains poorly understood. Huntington disease polyglutamine polyproline Huntingtin exon I with 51 glutamines human rhinovirus. Aggregates isolated post-mortem from HD patients or cell culture models, or grown in vitro, are β-sheet-enriched and share the typical cross-β diffraction pattern (9.Perutz M.F. Finch J.T.

Solid-state NMR studies of amyloid fibril structure.Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2011; 62: 279-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Although the β-sheet signature of the fibrils is indisputable, as evidenced by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and x-ray fiber diffraction (9.Perutz M.F.

Various structures have been proposed, ranging from water-filled nanotube (9.Perutz M.F. Finch J.T. Berriman J. Lesk A. Amyloid fibers are water-filled nanotubes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5591-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) and steric zipper arrangement with dry fibril core (14.Schneider R. Schumacher M.C. Mueller H. Nand D. Klaukien V. Heise H.

Computational study of the fibril organization of polyglutamine repeats reveals a common motif identified in β-helices.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 330-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Even the interpretations of the same x-ray fiber diffraction diagrams are inconsistent; Perutz et al. (9.Perutz M.F. Finch J.T. Berriman J. Lesk A. Amyloid fibers are water-filled nanotubes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5591-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) suggested a water-filled cylindrical β-sheet structure for the polyQ fibrils, whereas Sikorski and Atkins (16.Sikorski P. Atkins E. New model for crystalline polyglutamine assemblies and their connection with amyloid fibrils.Biomacromolecules. 2005; 6: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), reanalyzing the diffraction pattern, concluded that β-sheets elongated in fibril growth direction and stacked on top of each other. Site-directed spin labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy show a lack of stacking of many residues in a parallel, in-register arrangement that is commonly found in other amyloids (17.Bugg C.W.

Chem. 2012; 287: 31739-31746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations combined with docking experiments exclude some of the proposed monomer structures, e.g. α-helices or steric zipper, β-nanotube, and β-pseudohelix. NMR experiments, however, propose a steric zipper conformation for mature fibrils, where the individual monomers are stabilized via side-chain interactions (14.Schneider R. Schumacher M.C. Mueller H. Nand D. Klaukien V. Heise H. Riedel D. Wolf G. Behrmann E. Raunser S. Seidel R. Engelhard M. Baldus M. Structural characterization of polyglutamine fibrils by solid-state NMR spectroscopy.J. Mol.

Fluitt A.M. Hoganson A.J. Moran S.D. de Pablo J.J. Skinner J.L. Zanni M.T. Structural motif of polyglutamine amyloid fibrils discerned with mixed-isotope infrared spectroscopy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Arduini I. van der Wel P.C. Horne W.S. Wetzel R. β-Hairpin-mediated nucleation of polyglutamine amyloid formation.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 1183-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) proposes β-sheet-based structure as the most likely structure of the polyQ fibrils, although these studies do not reveal details on the molecular organization of the monomers, e.g. β-turns per monomer, orientation of neighboring monomers, and number of layers perpendicular to the fibril axis. Here, we assess the architecture of polyQ fibrils using a distance-dependent energy transfer combined with Monte Carlo simulations. Typically, HD progression is accompanied by the aggregation of mutant huntingtin (Htt) and its N-terminal fragments composed of exon 1 (20.Landles C. Sathasivam K. Weiss A. Woodman B. Moffitt H. Finkbeiner S. Sun B. Gafni J. Ellerby L.M. Trottier Y. Richards W.G. Osmand A. Paganetti P. Bates G.P.

N-terminal proteolysis of full-length mutant huntingtin in an inducible PC12 cell model of Huntington's disease.Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2970-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, we used Htt exon 1 with expanded polyQ length (here 51Q) to grow amyloid fibrils in vitro. By selective fluorophore labeling (donor or acceptor probes) of the polyQ monomers at various positions flanking the polyQ region, we measured the time-dependent fluorescent decay times of the donors. We developed a new algorithm for Monte Carlo simulations to capture time-resolved donor fluorescence decay and fit the experimental data to various models of fibril architecture. This approach allows for exact determination of distances between the monomers in addition to monomer dimensions in the fibrils. Our data suggest that polyQ monomers are organized in a five-layered β-sheet. Furthermore, each monomer consists of four strands with alternating N termini perpendicular to the fibril axis. The minimal length of the stable three-stranded polyQ region is 36 amino acids, which corresponds to the observed polyQ length threshold in HD pathologies. Htt exon 1 constructs with polyQ lengths of 25 or 51 were cloned in the pGEX6P vector and expressed in soluble form as GST fusions. All codons encoding Cys in GST were mutated to Ser to create a Cys-less GST fusion. Amino acids at positions 16, 69, or 111 in Htt exon 1 (the numbering is according to the primary sequence of Htt51Q) were mutated to Cys using a QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). All GST-tagged constructs were expressed in a soluble form in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) in minimal medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin, induced at optical density ∼0.4 for 4 h at 30 °C by adding 400 µm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and affinity-purified to homogeneity using the GST tag as described previously (22.Borwankar T. Röthlein C. Zhang G. Techen A. Dosche C. Ignatova Z. Natural osmolytes remodel the aggregation pathway of mutant huntingtin exon 1.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were flash-frozen in PBS (10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.3, 120 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). For fluorescent decay time measurements, 15 µm GST protein in PBS without glycerol was mixed with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and a 10-fold excess of the corresponding fluorescent dye, Alexa Fluor 488 maleimide or Alexa Fluor 594 maleimide. Samples were incubated for 5 h at 4 °C with slow vortexing at 80 rpm. Excess dye was removed with Bio-Spin P6 columns (Bio-Rad), and labeled protein was concentrated and washed in Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) with a cut-off size of 10 kDa until the ratio of dye and protein absorption remained constant. Labeling efficiency was calculated using the extinction coefficients of the protein and dyes at 280, 495, and 590 nm. Note that during the labeling and processing time, each construct remained soluble because of the GST tag. Alexa Fluor 488-labeled (donor-labeled) and Alexa Fluor 594-labeled (acceptor-labeled) GST-tagged proteins were mixed in different ratios (from 20%:1.5% to 20%:20%), and the final concentration of each sample was adjusted to 4 µm with unlabeled protein. One unit of HRV protease (Mobitec) was added to each 100-µl reaction to remove the GST tag and induce aggregation. Aggregation proceeded to completion for 48 h at 30 °C with gentle agitation at 300 rpm. The labeled aggregates were collected by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 30 min and washed several times with 1 ml of PBS to remove the soluble GST counterpart and non-aggregated Htt exon 1. Fluorescent decay times were recorded on an FL920 spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments) operated in a time-correlated single photon counting mode. A time window of 50 ns and 1024 channels were used in the measurements. Samples were excited at λex = 450 nm using a SC-400-PP supercontinuum source (Fianum), and the emission was collected at λem = 525 nm using a polarizer set at magic angle position and a multichannel plate (Europhoton) as a detector. The repetition rate of the excitation light source was set to 10 MHz. The measurements were stopped upon 10,000 counts collected in the most prominent channel. The Förster radius R0 was calculated according to R0=9×ln(10)×κ2×ΦD×J(λ)128×π5×NA×n46(Eq. 1) where κ2 accounts for the relative orientation between donor fluorescence and acceptor absorption transition dipole moments, ΦD is the fluorescence quantum yield of the donor, J(λ) is the overlap integral of the donor emission and acceptor absorption spectra, NA is the Avogadro constant, and n is the refractive index of the solution. Using a photoluminescence quantum yield measurement system (C9920, Hamamatsu Photonics), the quantum yield ΦD for the Alexa Fluor 488-labeled Htt exon 1 monomer was determined to be 0.6. The emission spectra of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled Htt exon 1 monomer and the excitation spectra of Alexa Fluor 594-labeled Htt exon 1 monomer were recorded on a QuantaMaster 40 (Photon Technology International), and Felix32 software was used to determine the Förster radius for the labeled monomer donor/acceptor pair. The relative orientation of the dye was assumed to be random and its movements much faster than the fluorescent decay times (κ2 = 2/3). The refractive index of an infinitely diluted aqueous solution (n = 1.33) was used. The Förster radius R0 was calculated to be 54 Å, which is in a good agreement with a previously determined Förster radius for the identical dye FRET pair in slightly different solvent conditions (23.Schuler B. Lipman E.A. Steinbach P.J. Kumke M. Eaton W.A. Polyproline and the “spectroscopic ruler” revisited with single-molecule fluorescence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2754-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The fluorescent decay time τ for the Alexa Fluor 488-labeled Htt exon I was determined using an algorithm written in our laboratory. The algorithm minimized the sum of the squared differences between the measured data and the theoretical fluorescent decay time function convoluted with the instrument response function. The fluorescent decay time τ was randomly varied by up to 10% in either direction in 100,000 iterations, and each result was accepted as a change in fluorescent decay time if it led to an improvement in the sum of squared differences. The resulting value was identical independent of what starting value was used, 0.01 ns or 100 ns. The fluorescent decay time of the monomer (τM) is the reciprocal sum of the rate constants ki of all possible processes leading to deactivation of excited dye. τM=1∑ikiM(Eq. 2) The quantum yield of the donor-labeled monomer ΦM can be expressed as the ratio of the fluorescence decay rate constant kFl,M to the sum of all deactivation rate constants. ΦM=kFlM∑ikiM(Eq. 3) The rate constant of fluorescence of donor-labeled monomers can therefore be calculated using, kFlM=ΦMτM(Eq. 4) Anisotropy measurements suggest little alteration of the solvent conditions, hence the difference between kFl,F and kFl,M should be close to zero. ΦF=kFlF×τF(Eq. 5) where ΦF is the quantum yield, and kFl,F and τF are the fluorescence rate constant and the fluorescence decay time of donor-labeled monomers in the fibril, respectively. The quantum yield of the system can be corrected for increased quenching in fibrils by considering the change in the sum of all decay rates in Equation 3. Because the Förster radius, R0, is dependent on the quantum yield, it was also adjusted for the labeled fibrils according to the donor fluorescent decay times in the fibrils for all different labeling positions. The code for predicting the output of the fluorescence decay time experiments was written in Fortran90. The input files contain the dimension of the simulated space, its periodicity, the number of donors and acceptors, and their expected coordinates for each studied structure. The fibrils used in the simulations consisted of 7500 monomers, which were randomly assigned with donors and acceptors to represent the experimental constellation. The fibrils were periodic in their growth direction to avoid stochastically insignificant situations at the rare fibril ends. Each donor was excited randomly with the probability Pexcitation=I×Δt×A(Ep×ND)×1−10−∈D×I×NDV(Eq. 6) where I is the irradiance, Δt is the time interval over which the excitation takes place, A is the surface area of light irradiation, ϵD is the extinction coefficient of the donor, l is the length of the excited volume in direction of the excitation beam, ND is the number of donors in the observed volume V, and EP is the energy of a photon with the excitation wavelength of 450 nm. To obtain sufficient signal, the low excitation probability was enhanced artificially to increase the speed of the simulations while ensuring that signals even from samples with the highest quenching rates were not altered by this adjustment. On average, 1 in 250 donors was excited in our simulations. Because the distance of the dye to the α-carbon of the first or last glutamine can easily be 2 nm, in the experimental setup for simulation purposes, all dye positions were changed by that distance in a random direction for all the excited donors and nearby acceptors in a given excitation cycle. During the simulated 50 ns, the dye positions were assumed to remain constant. All distances to the acceptors within the relevant distance (2R0 + 4 nm) were calculated for each excited donor. Subsequently, the FRET rates kT to all acceptors available to take up energy were added to the total sum of deactivation rates kT=1τF×R0r6(Eq. 7) where τF is the fluorescent decay time of the donor-labeled monomer within the fibril without any acceptor present and r is the distance to a given acceptor. As in the experiments, the 50-ns time frame was divided in 1024 equal intervals Δt. The probability of the donor being still excited after a given time interval was calculated, and a random number generator was used to deactivate the donor. The donor was therefore still excited with a probability. P(Dexcitation)=∫t0t0+Δte−∑iki×t×dt(Eq. 8) If the donor was deactivated, the ratios of the rate constants were used to assign the probabilities to the deactivation mechanisms. If a photon was emitted, it was added to the total photon number at this time interval. The possible bias due to restricted orientations of the excitable dyes and therefore time-dependent efficiencies of photon detection was found to be negligible by testing dye mobility in anisotropy measurements of fibrils labeled with donor only (see Fig. 2C). Subsequently, the acceptors excited in previous time steps, due to occurring transfers, were quenched according to their measured fluorescent decay times in the fibrils. P(Aexcitation)=∫t0t0Δte−tτAcceptor,F×dt(Eq. 9) If an acceptor is excited (or deactivated), it is removed from (or added again to) the list of available acceptors for each excited donor in its proximity. All 1024 time intervals were simulated for each still excited donor or until no excited donor was left, after which the simulation was reset and a new subset of donors was randomly excited. 10,000 photons were collected in at least one of the 1024 time intervals. For comparison with the simulated data sets, the experimental data were convoluted with the corresponding instrument response function, and the fit was judged by two methods: (i) the absolute differences between the expected and measured amount of counts and (ii) the sum of the squares of the differences. To categorize different simulated structures, the simulations were separately and collectively judged with tests i and ii. Each test result was then judged in relation to the mean of all 0% acceptor samples within each set of labeling positions. The fibrils with 0% acceptor serve as a perfect standard to extract the distance between the experimental and simulated values because no errors can occur by wrongly predicted donor-acceptor distances or interactions. For test i, divergences from the 0% acceptor sample up to 5% were designated as good, up to 25% as acceptable fits and more than 25% as unacceptable fits. For test ii, those borders were 35 and 80%, respectively. Samples for electron microscopy were washed with pure water instead of PBS to avoid visual artifacts. Aggregates were loaded on freshly glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH, Jena, Germany), covered with an additional self-made thin layer of continuous carbon, washed with deionized water, and negatively stained using 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Samples were imaged using either a 100-kV Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope equipped with a 1k F114 Fastscan camera (Tietz Video and Image Processing Systems) or a 120-kV Tecnai G2 Spirit microscope equipped with a 2k Eagle CCD camera (FEI) at a nominal magnification between 20,000× and 42,000×. For cryo-electron microscopy, samples were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a semi-automated Vitrobot plunger (FEI) and imaged using low dose conditions. To assess the structure of native polyglutamine fibrils of Htt exon 1, the position of the mutation within the target sequence and fluorophore labeling should have minimal to no perturbation of Htt exon 1 aggregation behavior or fibril structure. PolyQ stretches (Fig. 1A) are invariant among the polyQ-containing proteins and are composed solely of consecutive glutamine repeats (1.De Los Rios P. Hafner M. Pastore A. Explaining the length threshold of polyglutamine aggregation.J. Phys. Condens. Matter. 2012; 24: 244105Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A mutation within the polyQ stretch alters the length of the hairpins between the polyQ stretches (24.Poirier M.A. Jiang H. Ross C.A. A structure-based analysis of huntingtin mutant polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity: evidence for a compact β-sheet structure.Hum. Mol.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 17014-17019Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Two consecutive polyproline (polyP) regions downstream of the polyQ stretch (Fig. 1A) influence the aggregation propensity of the polyQ stretch and stability of the polyQ fibrils (26.Bhattacharyya A.

Furthermore, the 17-amino acid-long N terminus of Htt exon (Fig. 1A) is crucial for the initial aggregation steps (27.Tam S. Spiess C. Auyeung W. Joachimiak L. Chen B. Poirier M.A. Frydman J.

The unprecedented complexity of how the HttQ primary sequence controls the aggregation behavior restricts the positions available for introducing cysteines and attaching dyes. Because we aimed at elucidating the conformation of the polyQ stretches within the mature amyloid fibrils, we have chosen two positions flanking this stretch, S16C upstream and P69C downstream of the polyQ region (Fig. 1A). Mutants were numbered according to the primary sequence of Htt exon 1 with a pathological polyQ length (Htt51Q)."
https://openalex.org/W2024838847,"Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) is known to be an endogenous opioid-modulating peptide. Nevertheless, very few researches focused on the interaction between NPFF and endogenous opioid peptides. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of NPFF system on the supraspinal antinociceptive effects induced by the endogenous µ-opioid receptor agonists, endomorphin-1 (EM-1) and endomorphin-2 (EM-2). In the mouse tail-flick assay, intracerebroventricular injection of EM-1 induced antinociception via µ-opioid receptor while the antinociception of intracerebroventricular injected EM-2 was mediated by both µ- and κ-opioid receptors. In addition, central administration of NPFF significantly reduced EM-1-induced central antinociception, but enhanced EM-2-induced central antinociception. The results using the selective NPFF1 and NPFF2 receptor agonists indicated that the EM-1-modulating action of NPFF was mainly mediated by NPFF2 receptor, while NPFF potentiated EM-2-induecd antinociception via both NPFF1 and NPFF2 receptors. To further investigate the roles of µ- and κ-opioid systems in the opposite effects of NPFF on central antinociception of endomprphins, the µ- and κ-opioid receptors selective agonists DAMGO and U69593, respectively, were used. Our results showed that NPFF could reduce the central antinociception of DAMGO via NPFF2 receptor and enhance the central antinociception of U69593 via both NPFF1 and NPFF2 receptors. Taken together, our data demonstrate that NPFF exerts opposite effects on central antinociception of endomorphins and provide the first evidence that NPFF potentiate antinociception of EM-2, which might result from the interaction between NPFF and κ-opioid systems."
https://openalex.org/W2033206306,"Factors determining the degree of dietary generalism versus specialism are central in ecology. Species that are generalists at the population level may in fact be composed of specialized individuals. The optimal diet theory assumes that individuals choose diets that maximize fitness, and individual specialization may occur if individuals' ability to locate, recognize, and handle different food types differ. We investigate if individuals of the marine herbivorous slug Elysia viridis, which co-occur at different densities on several green macroalgal species in the field, are specialized to different algal hosts. Individual slugs were collected from three original algal host species (Cladophora sericea, Cladophora rupestris and Codium fragile) in the field, and short-term habitat choice and consumption, as well as long-term growth (proxy for fitness), on four algal diet species (the original algal host species and Chaetomorpha melagonium) were studied in laboratory experiments. Nutritional (protein, nitrogen, and carbon content) and morphological (dry weight, and cell/utricle volume) algal traits were also measured to investigate if they correlated with the growth value of the different algal diets. E. viridis individuals tended to choose and consume algal species that were similar to their original algal host. Long-term growth of E. viridis, however, was mostly independent of original algal host, as all individuals reached a larger size on the non-host C. melagonium. E. viridis growth was positively correlated to algal cell/utricle volume but not to any of the other measured algal traits. Because E. viridis feeds by piercing individual algal cells, the results indicate that slugs may receive more cytoplasm, and thus more energy per unit time, on algal species with large cells/utricles. We conclude that E. viridis individuals are specialized on different hosts, but host choice in natural E. viridis populations is not determined by the energetic value of seaweed diets as predicted by the ODT."
https://openalex.org/W2081560448,"The discriminatory capability of different adiposity indices for atherosclerosis and lipid abnormalities remains uncertain. This study aimed to identify the best adiposity index for predicting early atherosclerosis and abnormal lipid profiles among anthropometric parameters and body fat measures in middle-aged and elderly Chinese.A total of 2,063 women and 814 men (57.6±5.2 y) were recruited for this community-based cross-sectional study. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were assessed. Body fat mass and its percentage values for the whole body and trunk were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The intima-media thicknesses (IMTs) of the common carotid arteries (CCA), internal carotid arteries (ICA) and bifurcation (BIF) were determined via B-mode ultrasound. The fasting lipid profiles were assessed.With per SD increase of adiposity indices, the magnitude of the changes of IMT values and lipid profiles was more substantial for WC, WHR and WHtR in both genders. A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that WC, WHR and WHtR were more sensitive in predicting the presence of intima-media thickening at the three segments as well as the lipids disturbances in women and men. In general, BIA-derived measures have no added predictive value for IMT-thickening as opposed to those three traditional abdominal measures.Our findings suggest that abdominal anthropometric measures including WC, WHR and WHtR are sensitive for discriminating carotid atherosclerosis and lipids abnormalities. WC is the best index because of its simplicity in routine use."
https://openalex.org/W2009994967,"Obesity has become one of the largest public health challenges worldwide. Recently, certain bacterial and viral pathogens have been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data, plasma samples and post-mortem tissue specimens derived from a risk assessment study in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)-infected female cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). The original study design aimed to determine minimal infectious doses after oral or intracerebral (i.c.) infection of macaques to assess the risk for humans. High-dose exposures resulted in 100% attack rates and a median incubation time of 4.7 years as described previously. Retrospective analyses of clinical data from high-dosed macaques revealed that foodborne BSE transmission caused rapid weight gain within 1.5 years post infection (β = 0.915; P<0.0001) which was not seen in age- and sex-matched control animals or i.c. infected animals. The rapid-onset obesity was not associated with impaired pancreatic islet function or glucose metabolism. In the early preclinical phase of oral transmission associated with body weight gain, prion accumulation was confined to the gastrointestinal tract. Intriguingly, immunohistochemical findings suggest that foodborne BSE transmission has a pathophysiological impact on gut endocrine cells which may explain rapid weight gain. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental model which clearly demonstrates that foodborne pathogens can induce obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1976965255,"Enzyme extraction from solid matrix is as important step in solid-state fermentation to obtain soluble enzymes for further immobilization and application in biocatalysis. A method for the recovery of a pool of lipases from Penicillium simplicissimum produced by solid-state fermentation was developed. For lipase recovery different extraction solution was used and phosphate buffer containing Tween 80 and NaCl showed the best results, yielding lipase activity of 85.7 U/g and 65.7 U/g, respectively. The parameters with great impacts on enzyme extraction detected by the Plackett-Burman analysis were studied by Central Composite Rotatable experimental designs where a quadratic model was built showing maximum predicted lipase activity (160 U/g) at 25°C, Tween 80 0.5% (w/v), pH 8.0 and extraction solution 7 mL/g, maintaining constant buffer molarity of 0.1 M and 200 rpm. After the optimization process a 2.5 fold increase in lipase activity in the crude extract was obtained, comparing the intial value (64 U/g) with the experimental design (160 U/g), thus improving the overall productivity of the process."
https://openalex.org/W2000666528,"Background The visceral leishmaniasis (VL) elimination program in Bangladesh is in its attack phase. The primary goal of this phase is to decrease the burden of VL as much as possible. Active case detection (ACD) by the fever camp method and an approach using past VL cases in the last 6–12 months have been found useful for detection of VL patients in the community. We aimed to explore the yield of Accelerated Active Case Detection (AACD) of non-self reporting VL as well as the factors that are associated with non-self reporting to hospitals in endemic communities of Bangladesh. Methods Our study was conducted in the Trishal sub-district of Mymensingh, a highly VL endemic region of Bangladesh. We used a two-stage sampling strategy from 12 VL endemic unions of Trishal. Two villages from each union were selected at random. We looked for VL patients who had self-reported to the hospital and were under treatment from these villages. Then we conducted AACD for VL cases in those villages using house-to-house visit. Suspected VL cases were referred to the Trishal hospital where diagnosis and treatment of VL was done following National Guidelines for VL case management. We collected socio-demographic information from patients or a patient guardian using a structured questionnaire. Results The total number of VL cases was 51. Nineteen of 51 (37.3%) were identified by AACD. Poverty, female gender and poor knowledge about VL were independent factors associated with non self-reporting to the hospital. Conclusion Our primary finding is that AACD is a useful method for early detection of VL cases that would otherwise go unreported to the hospital in later stage due to poverty, poor knowledge about VL and gender inequity. We recommend that the National VL Program should consider AACD to strengthen its early VL case detection strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2144726620,"In various contexts, animals rely on acoustic signals to differentiate between conspecifics. Currently, studies examining vocal signatures use two main approaches. In the first approach, researchers search for acoustic characteristics that have the potential to be individual specific. This approach yields information on variation in signal parameters both within and between individuals and generates practical tools that can be used in population monitoring. In the second approach, playback experiments with natural calls are conducted to discern whether animals are capable of discriminating among the vocal signatures of different individuals. However, both approaches do not reveal the exact signal characteristics that are being used in the discrimination process. In this study, we tested whether an individual-specific call characteristic – namely the length of the intervals between successive maximal amplitude peaks within syllables (PPD) – is crucial in neighbour-stranger discrimination by males of the nocturnal and highly secretive bird species, the corncrake (Crex crex). We conducted paired playback experiments in which corncrakes (n = 47) were exposed to artificial calls with PPD characteristics of neighbour and stranger birds. These artificial calls differed only in PPD structure. The calls were broadcast from a speaker, and we recorded the birds' behavioural responses. Although corncrakes have previously been experimentally shown to discriminate between neighbours and strangers, we found no difference in the responses to the artificial calls representing neighbours versus strangers. This finding demonstrates that even if vocal signatures are individual specific within a species, it does not automatically mean that said signatures are being crucial in discrimination among individuals. At the same time, the birds' aggressive responses to the artificial calls indicated that the information transmitted by PPDs is important in species-specific call recognition and may be used by males and/or females to evaluate sender quality, similarly like sound frequency in some insect species."
https://openalex.org/W2066668427,"Decision making at a cellular level determines different fates for isogenic cells. However, it is not yet clear how rational decisions are encoded in the genome, how they are transmitted to their offspring, and whether they evolve and become optimized throughout generations. In this paper, we use a game theoretic approach to explain how rational decisions are made in the presence of cooperators and competitors. Our results suggest the existence of an internal switch that operates as a biased coin. The biased coin is, in fact, a biochemical bistable network of interacting genes that can flip to one of its stable states in response to different environmental stimuli. We present a framework to describe how the positions of attractors in such a gene regulatory network correspond to the behavior of a rational player in a competing environment. We evaluate our model by considering lysis/lysogeny decision making of bacteriophage lambda in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2003800129,"Low to moderate ethanol consumption has been associated with protective effects in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, RA. An expansion of γδ T cells induced by isopentenyl pyrophosphate, IPP, likewise seems to have a protective role in arthritis. The aim of this project was to test the hypothesis that low doses of ethanol can enhance IPP-induced expansion of synovial fluid γδ T cells from patients with arthritis and may thereby potentially account for the beneficial effects of ethanol on symptoms of the arthritic process. Thus, mononuclear cells from synovial fluid (SF) from 15 patients with arthritis and from peripheral blood (PB) from 15 healthy donors were stimulated with low concentrations of ethanol and IPP for 7 days in vitro. IPP in combination with ethanol 0.015%, 2.5 mM, equivalent to the decrease per hour in blood ethanol concentration due to metabolism, gave a significantly higher fractional expansion of SF γδ T cells compared with IPP alone after 7 days (ratio 10.1+/−4.0, p<0.0008, n = 12) in patients with arthritis. Similar results were obtained for PB γδ T cells from healthy controls (ratio 2.0+/−0.4, p<0.011, n = 15). The augmented expansion of γδ T cells in SF is explained by a higher proliferation (p = 0.0034, n = 11) and an increased survival (p<0.005, n = 11) in SF cultures stimulated with IPP plus ethanol compared to IPP alone. The synergistic effects of IPP and ethanol indicate a possible allosteric effect of ethanol. Similar effects could be seen when stimulating PB with ethanol in presence of risedronate, which has the ability to increase endogenous levels of IPP. We conclude that expansion of γδ T cells by combinatorial drug effects, possibly in fixed-dose combination, FDC, of ethanol in the presence of IPP might give a protective role in diseases such as arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W1998103525,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a genetic disease with multiple features that are suggestive of premature aging. Most patients with HGPS carry a mutation on one of their copies of the LMNA gene. The LMNA gene encodes the lamin A and lamin C proteins, which are the major proteins of the nuclear lamina. The organs of the cardiovascular system are amongst those that are most severely affected in HGPS, undergoing a progressive depletion of vascular smooth muscle cells, and most children with HGPS die in their early teens from cardio-vascular disease and other complications from atherosclerosis. In this study, we developed a transgenic mouse model based on the tet-ON system to increase the understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to the most lethal aspect of HGPS. To induce the expression of the most common HGPS mutation, LMNA c.1824C>T; p.G608G, in the vascular smooth muscle cells of the aortic arch and thoracic aorta, we used the previously described reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator, sm22α-rtTA. However, the expression of the reverse sm22α-transactivator was barely detectable in the arteries, and this low level of expression was not sufficient to induce the expression of the target human lamin A minigene. The results from this study are important because they suggest caution during the use of previously functional transgenic animal models and emphasize the importance of assessing transgene expression over time."
