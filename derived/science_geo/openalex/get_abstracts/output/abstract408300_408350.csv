Our study was designed to analyze circulating serum microRNAs in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Methodology/Principal Findings We first explored microRNA expression profiles in tissue and serum using TaqMan Low Density Arrays in each six malignant and benign samples: Although 109 microRNAs were circulating at higher levels in cancer patients' serum, we identified only 36 microRNAs with up-regulation in RCC tissue and serum of RCC patients. Seven candidate microRNAs were selected for verification based on the finding of up-regulation in serum and tissue of RCC patients: miR-7-1*, miR-93, miR-106b*, miR-210, miR-320b, miR-1233 and miR-1290 levels in serum of healthy controls (n = 30) and RCC (n = 33) patients were determined using quantitative real-time PCR (TaqMan MicroRNA Assays). miR-1233 was increased in RCC patients, and thus validated in a multicentre cohort of 84 RCC patients and 93 healthy controls using quantitative real-time PCR (sensitivity 77.4%, specificity 37.6%, AUC 0.588). We also studied 13 samples of patients with angiomyolipoma or oncocytoma, whose serum miR-1233 levels were similar to RCC patients. Circulating microRNAs were not correlated with clinical-pathological parameters. Conclusions/Significance MicroRNA levels are distinctly increased in cancer patients, although only a small subset of circulating microRNAs has a tumor-specific origin. We identify circulating miR-1233 as a potential biomarker for RCC patients. Larger-scaled studies are warranted to fully explore the role of circulating microRNAs in RCC."
https://openalex.org/W2087665027,"TRPM8 (Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin-8) is a cold- and menthol-gated ion channel necessary for the detection of cold temperatures in the mammalian peripheral nervous system. Functioning TRPM8 channels are required for behavioral responses to innocuous cool, noxious cold, injury-evoked cold hypersensitivity, cooling-mediated analgesia, and thermoregulation. Because of these various roles, the ability to pharmacologically manipulate TRPM8 function to alter the excitability of cold-sensing neurons may have broad impact clinically. Here we examined a novel compound, PBMC (1-phenylethyl-4-(benzyloxy)-3-methoxybenzyl(2-aminoethyl)carbamate) which robustly and selectively inhibited TRPM8 channels in vitro with sub-nanomolar affinity, as determined by calcium microfluorimetry and electrophysiology. The actions of PBMC were selective for TRPM8, with no functional effects observed for the sensory ion channels TRPV1 and TRPA1. PBMC altered TRPM8 gating by shifting the voltage-dependence of menthol-evoked currents towards positive membrane potentials. When administered systemically to mice, PBMC treatment produced a dose-dependent hypothermia in wildtype animals while TRPM8-knockout mice remained unaffected. This hypothermic response was reduced at lower doses, whereas responses to evaporative cooling were still significantly attenuated. Lastly, systemic PBMC also diminished cold hypersensitivity in inflammatory and nerve-injury pain models, but was ineffective against oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic cold hypersensitivity, despite our findings that TRPM8 is required for the cold-related symptoms of this pathology. Thus PBMC is an attractive compound that serves as a template for the formulation of highly specific and potent TRPM8 antagonists that will have utility both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2105151327,"Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive memory and cognitive decline during middle to late adult life. The AD brain is characterized by deposition of amyloid β peptide (Aβ), which is produced from amyloid precursor protein by β- and γ-secretase (presenilin complex)-mediated sequential cleavage. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells potentially provide an opportunity to generate a human cell-based model of AD that would be crucial for drug discovery as well as for investigating mechanisms of the disease. Methodology/Principal Findings We differentiated human iPS (hiPS) cells into neuronal cells expressing the forebrain marker, Foxg1, and the neocortical markers, Cux1, Satb2, Ctip2, and Tbr1. The iPS cell-derived neuronal cells also expressed amyloid precursor protein, β-secretase, and γ-secretase components, and were capable of secreting Aβ into the conditioned media. Aβ production was inhibited by β-secretase inhibitor, γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI), and an NSAID; however, there were different susceptibilities to all three drugs between early and late differentiation stages. At the early differentiation stage, GSI treatment caused a fast increase at lower dose (Aβ surge) and drastic decline of Aβ production. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that the hiPS cell-derived neuronal cells express functional β- and γ-secretases involved in Aβ production; however, anti-Aβ drug screening using these hiPS cell-derived neuronal cells requires sufficient neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2109726534,"Although the concept of cancer stem cells or cancer-initiating cells had created a new paradigm for the treatment of malignant tumors, it remains unclear how cancer-initiating cells can be eradicated. We have previously reported that the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-Sox4-Sox2 pathway is essential for glioma-initiating cells to retain their stemness, and inhibition of TGF-β signaling may lead to differentiation of glioma-initiating cells (Ikushima, H., Todo, T., Ino, Y., Takahashi, M., Miyazawa, K., and Miyazono, K. (2009) Cell Stem Cell 5, 504–514). Here we demonstrate that Oct4 plays essential roles in retention of the stemness properties of glioma-initiating cells through positive regulation of Sox2 expression. We also show that, in glioma-initiating cells, Oct4 is associated with Sox4 and that Oct4-Sox4 complexes cooperatively activate the enhancer activity of the SOX2 gene. In contrast, in fetal neural progenitor cells, Sox2 expression is enhanced by transcriptional complex containing Sox2 protein itself, and this self-reinforcing loop of Sox2 appears to be disrupted in glioma-initiating cells, suggesting that Sox2 expression in glioma-initiating cells is differently regulated from that in neural progenitor cells. Our findings reveal differences between glioma-initiating cells and fetal neural progenitor cells and may open the way to depriving glioma-initiating cells of tumorigenic activity without affecting normal tissues.

Glioblastoma, also known as grade IV astrocytoma, is the most aggressive form of malignant glioma and is one of the most malignant human cancers, with an estimated median survival of only ∼1 year (1Stupp R.

Cancer stem cells or cancer-initiating cells are tumor cells characterized by their ability to induce tumorigenesis and to self-renew (3Reya T. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar). Similar to other types of tumor cells, glioma-initiating cells (or glioma stem cells) have been isolated from human glioblastoma tissues (4Singh S.K. Hawkins C. Clarke I.D. Squire J.A. Bayani J.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5821-5828PubMed Google Scholar). Following their identification, glioma-initiating cells have been intensively investigated and have been found to exhibit strong resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (6Bao S. Wu Q. McLendon R.E. Hao Y. Shi Q. Hjelmeland A.B. Dewhirst M.W. Bigner D.D. Rich J.N. Nature. 2006; 444: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (4948) Google Scholar, 7Liu G. Yuan X. Zeng Z. Tunici P. Ng H. Abdulkadir I.R. Lu L. Irvin D. Black K.L. Yu J.S. Mol. Cancer. 2006; 5: 67Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the failure to cure glioblastoma may be due to existing therapeutic strategies that affect only the tumor bulk and not glioma-initiating cells (8Zhou B.B. Zhang H. Damelin M. Geles K.G. Grindley J.C. Dirks P.B. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 806-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). These findings indicate the need for an innovative therapeutic strategy enabling functional eradication of glioma-initiating cells. Although it has yet to be fully determined how the stemness of glioma-initiating cells is maintained, a few signaling pathways, including Hedgehog (9Clement V. Sanchez P. de Tribolet N. Radovanovic I. Ruiz i Altaba A. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 165-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (10Piccirillo S.G.

Miyazono K. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), have been implicated to contribute to maintenance of the stemness properties of these cells. Although the transcriptional machinery required is under investigation, we have recently reported crucial roles for the Sox axis. Sox4 interacts with the SOX2 enhancer region to induce Sox2 expression, and this “Sox4-Sox2” axis maintains stemness properties of glioma-initiating cells under the control of TGF-β signaling (11Ikushima H. Todo T. Ino Y. Takahashi M. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 504-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The POU class 5 transcription factor Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) is essential for establishing and maintaining the pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells (14Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K.

Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar). Deletion of Oct4 from embryonic stem cells results in trophoblast differentiation (16Niwa H. Toyooka Y. Shimosato D. Strumpf D. Takahashi K. Yagi R. Rossant J. Cell. 2005; 123: 917-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Introduction of Oct4 together with Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc into human or mouse adult fibroblasts results in the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (17Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19304) Google Scholar, 18Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15285) Google Scholar). In addition, Oct4 has been detected in high grade glioma and specific types of testicular germ cell tumors (19Du Z. Jia D. Liu S. Wang F. Li G. Zhang Y. Cao X. Ling E.A. Hao A. Glia. 2009; 57: 724-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Cheng L. Sung M.T. Cossu-Rocca P. Jones T.D. MacLennan G.T. De Jong J. Lopez-Beltran A. Montironi R. Looijenga L.H. J.

However, the role of Oct4 in cancer stem cells has yet to be fully determined. Here, we report that Oct4 is a factor of crucial importance for the maintenance of tumorigenic activity of glioma-initiating cells. We have previously reported that, in contrast to Sox4 and Sox2, the expression of Oct4 is not regulated by TGF-β signaling in glioma-initiating cells (11Ikushima H. Todo T. Ino Y. Takahashi M. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 504-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of Oct4 expression in glioma-initiating cells resulted in suppression of sphere formation in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Oct4 knockdown also potentiated sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy. We also demonstrated that Oct4 interacted with Sox4 and cooperatively activated the SOX2 enhancer region to maintain stemness properties of glioma-initiating cells. Notably, Sox2 expression in glioma-initiating cells was induced by the Oct4-Sox4 complex acting on the SOX2 enhancer region to maintain stemness properties, whereas that in fetal neural progenitor cells was regulated by a transcriptional complex containing Sox2 protein itself through a self-reinforcing regulatory loop. These findings indicate that Oct4 plays a role in the tumorigenic activity of glioblastoma and suggest that the stemness properties of glioma-initiating cells are regulated by mechanisms different from those of neural progenitor cells. Primary grade IV glioblastoma samples were obtained during surgery from consenting patients, as approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Tokyo Hospital. Spheres were cultured in DMEM/F-12 serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml EGF, and 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (both from PeproTech). Characteristics of the glioma-initiating cells were evaluated in our previous study (11Ikushima H. Todo T. Ino Y. Takahashi M. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 504-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Normal human fetal neural progenitor cells were obtained from Lonza and cultured in maintenance medium (NPMM, Lonza). U373MG cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and non-essential amino acids (0.1 mm). The antibodies used were as follows: anti-Musashi (Chemicon), anti-Nestin (Chemicon), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (Dako), anti-Tuj1 (Covance), anti-Oct4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Sox2 (R&D), anti-Sox4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich). Glioma-initiating cells were cultured in non-tissue-culture-treated flasks (BD Biosciences) with vented caps (BD Biosciences) for 7 days. Floating spheres in five fields per sample were counted under a microscope (magnification, ×40). Sphere cells were dissociated and plated in 96-well plates in 200 μl of serum-free medium. After a 7-day culture, the percentage of wells not containing spheres for each cell plating density was calculated and plotted against the number of cells per well. siRNAs (see supplemental Table S1 for sequences) were purchased from Invitrogen and introduced into cells using Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glioma-initiating cells were seeded on poly-l-ornithine (Sigma)- and fibronectin (Sigma)-coated slide glasses and cultured for 7 days with the indicated siRNA in serum-free medium. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, and incubated with the indicated antibodies. Subsequently, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies and stained with propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) for nuclear staining. Stained cells were observed with a confocal microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss). Cells were lysed with a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1% aprotinin, and 5 mm EDTA. Proteins in cleared cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Fluoro Trans W membrane (Pall). Immunoblotting was performed using the indicated antibodies. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed as described previously (22Ikushima H. Komuro A. Isogaya K. Shinozaki M. Hellman U. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2955-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All samples were run in triplicate in each experiment. The primers used are listed in supplemental Table S1. Values were normalized to that for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 3The abbreviations used are: ChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationRe-IPre-immunoprecipitationTuj1βIII-tubulinGATA1-2, GATA-binding proteins 1 and 2. was performed as described previously (11Ikushima H.

PCR primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. For ChIP re-immunoprecipitation (Re-IP) assays, protein-DNA complexes were eluted from immunoprecipitation by incubation with 10 mm DTT at 37 °C for 30 min and diluted 1:50 in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), followed by Re-IP with secondary antibodies. chromatin immunoprecipitation re-immunoprecipitation βIII-tubulin -2, GATA-binding proteins 1 and 2. Quantitation of cell viability was performed using a colorimetric assay for mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (WST-8, Nacalai Tesque) after treatment with temozolomide (LKT Laboratories). The SOX2 enhancer region (+3553 through +4290) was cloned into a pGL4 vector (Promega, Madison, WI) with a minimal promoter, and a luciferase assay was performed as described previously (22Ikushima H. Komuro A. Isogaya K. Shinozaki M. Hellman U. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2955-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Values were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity under the control of thymidine kinase promoter. Viable glioma-initiating cells (5 × 104) in 5 μl of DMEM/F-12 medium were injected stereotactically into the right cerebral hemisphere of 5-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu mice at a depth of 3 mm. All animal experimental protocols were performed in accordance with the policies of the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Tokyo. The transcriptional network essential for maintenance of glioma-initiating cells has not been fully determined. We used glioma-initiating cells obtained from two patients with glioblastoma, termed TGS-01 and TGS-04, and cultured in serum-free medium to study this network. The glioma-initiating capacities of these cells were characterized in our previous studies (11Ikushima H. Todo T. Ino Y. Takahashi M. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 504-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Oct4 is known to be one of the most crucial self-renewal gene products and to play pivotal roles in maintaining stemness of embryonic stem cells and neural stem cells. We have demonstrated that expression of Oct4 is not affected by TGF-β signaling in glioma-initiating cells (11Ikushima H. Todo T. Ino Y. Takahashi M. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 504-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). To study the role of Oct4 in glioma-initiating cells, we first examined the effects of Oct4 knockdown on their biological properties. After Oct4 expression was knocked down (supplemental Fig. S1), glioma-initiating cells exhibited marked reduction of sphere-forming ability in serial sphere-forming assay (Fig. 1A), suggesting that Oct4 is required for self-renewal of glioma-initiating cells. In limiting dilution assay, TGS-01 or TGS-04 with Oct4 siRNA also showed less capacity for self-renewal than control cells (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained with the use of glioma-initiating cells, TGS-02, TGS-03, and TGS-05, derived from other patients with glioblastoma (supplemental Fig. S2). We also examined the effects of Oct4 knockdown on proliferation and apoptosis of glioma-initiating cells. Treatment of siRNA against Oct4 did not significantly induce apoptosis but reduced proliferation of TGF-01 and TGS-04 cells (supplemental Fig. S3). Glioma-initiating cells have been reported to express neural precursor cell markers, but to only minimally express neural or glial differentiation markers (11Ikushima H. Todo T. Ino Y. Takahashi M. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 504-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). To examine the expression of these marker proteins in each type of cell, spheres in serum-free medium were disaggregated and seeded on poly-l-ornithine- and fibronectin-coated slide glasses. Knockdown of Oct4 expression by siRNA decreased the number of cells positive for Nestin or Musashi (neural precursor cell markers) and increased that for glial fibrillary acidic protein (astrocyte differentiated marker) or Tuj1 (neuronal marker) (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that Oct4 is required for maintenance of the stemness properties of glioma-initiating cells in vitro. To study the role of Oct4 in the tumorigenic activity of glioma-initiating cells in vivo, we next examined the effects of Oct4 knockdown on intracranial growth of glioma-initiating cells. We treated dissociated glioma-initiating cells with siRNA against Oct4. Cells from the newly formed glioma spheres were orthotopically inoculated into the brains of immunocompromised mice. The growth of glioma-initiating cells was inhibited by pretreatment with siRNA against Oct4, and the mice inoculated with the pretreated glioma-initiating cells survived significantly longer than those inoculated with control cells (Fig. 2). We also examined tumor formation in the brain 30 days after transplantation. Whereas mice with control glioma-initiating cells displayed large tumors in the brain, those with the pretreated glioma-initiating cells exhibited no evidence of tumor on histopathologic examination (Fig. 2). These results suggest that Oct4 is essential for the maintenance of tumorigenicity of glioma-initiating cells and that loss of tumorigenicity by Oct4 knockdown is an irreversible process. As suggested by the cancer stem cell model, the resistance of glioma-initiating cells to conventional chemotherapy may be a major cause of the low cure rate for glioblastoma (3Reya T. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar). Although oral administration of temozolomide, a new alkylating agent, has shown efficacy in patients with glioblastoma, it was found that glioma-initiating cells were resistant to temozolomide-induced cell death, causing tumors to recur (7Liu G. Yuan X. Zeng Z. Tunici P. Ng H. Abdulkadir I.R. Lu L. Irvin D. Black K.L. Yu J.S. Mol. Cancer. 2006; 5: 67Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of Oct4 knockdown on the sensitivity of glioma-initiating cells to temozolomide-induced cell death. Control TGS-01 and TGS-04 cells exhibited low sensitivities to temozolomide treatment (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S4). In contrast, treatment with increasing concentrations of temozolomide suppressed the viability of TGS-01 and TGS-04 cells pretreated with Oct4 siRNA in dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that Oct4 is involved in acquisition of drug-resistance properties of glioblastoma. We next studied the molecular mechanisms that underlie the putative pathological roles of Oct4 in glioma-initiating cells. Oct4 regulates stemness properties of embryonic and neural stem cells via several mechanisms (23Boiani M. Schöler H.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 872-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Among them, Sox2, which has recently been reported to be a critical regulator of the stemness of glioma-initiating cells (11Ikushima H. Todo T. Ino Y. Takahashi M. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 504-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 24Gangemi R.M. Griffero F. Marubbi D. Perera M. Capra M.C. Malatesta P. Ravetti G.L. Zona G.L. Daga A. Corte G. Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), is known to be one of the major downstream targets of Oct4 in embryonic stem cells (25Chew J.L. Loh Y.H. Zhang W. Chen X. Tam W.L. Yeap L.S. Li P. Ang Y.S. Lim B. Robson P. Ng H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6031-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether Sox2 acts downstream of Oct4 in glioma-initiating cells. Oct4 knockdown in glioma-initiating cells resulted in down-regulation of Sox2 expression (Fig. 4A), indicating that Oct4 positively regulates Sox2 expression in glioma-initiating cells. To examine whether this regulation is directly mediated at the transcriptional level, we performed a ChIP assay using an antibody to Oct4. It has been demonstrated that the enhancer element located in the 3′ flanking region of the SOX2 gene is important for the regulation of Sox2 expression in embryonic stem cells (25Chew J.L. Loh Y.H. Zhang W. Chen X. Tam W.L. Yeap L.S. Li P. Ang Y.S. Lim B. Robson P. Ng H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6031-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 26Tomioka M. Nishimoto M. Miyagi S. Katayanagi T. Fukui N. Niwa H. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3202-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Recruitment of Oct4 to the SOX2 enhancer element was observed in glioma-initiating cells (Fig. 4B). In contrast, Oct4 was only minimally associated with the SOX2 enhancer element in matched “differentiated” cells that were derived from the same patient but were cultured in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum to induce differentiation. These results appear to be due to the lower levels of expression of Oct4 in the “differentiated” cells compared with the “sphere” cells (Fig. 4C). These findings together indicate that Oct4 induces Sox2 expression in glioma-initiating cells through direct binding to the SOX2 enhancer region. In our previous study, another transcription factor, Sox4, was shown to associate with the SOX2 enhancer region and maintain the stemness and tumorigenicity of glioma-initiating cells (11Ikushima H. Todo T. Ino Y. Takahashi M. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 504-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In addition, consensus sequences of Sox proteins and Oct4 exist proximally in the SOX2 enhancer region (Fig. 5A). These findings prompted us to study the interaction of the Sox axis and Oct4 in the maintenance of stemness properties of glioma-initiating cells. First, we examined the interaction between Sox4 and Oct4. As shown in Fig. 5B, endogenous Oct4 physically interacted with endogenous Sox4 in glioma-initiating cells. Moreover, ChIP Re-IP experiments demonstrated that Sox4 and Oct4 exist in the same transcription complex on the SOX2 enhancer region (Fig. 5C). We next studied the effects of the Oct4-Sox4 complex on Sox2 expression in glioma-initiating cells. When Oct4 and Sox4 were both knocked down, Sox2 expression was more strongly down-regulated than it was by separate knockdown of Oct4 or Sox4 (Fig. 6A). Suppression of SOX2 enhancer activity by knockdown of Oct4 or Sox4 was also confirmed in luciferase assay using TGS-01 and TGS-04 cells (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the enhancer activity was synergistically activated by Oct4 and Sox4 overexpression in glioblastoma cell line U373MG (Fig. 6B), in which the levels of expression of Oct4 and Sox4 were significantly lower than in glioma-initiating cells (data not shown). To confirm a direct association of Oct4 and Sox4 with the SOX2 enhancer region, we generated luciferase constructs with mutated Oct4 and/or Sox4 binding elements in the SOX2 enhancer region (Fig. 6C). Mutation of one of the two elements led to a reduction of enhancer activity compared with the wild-type enhancer. When both binding elements were mutated, the enhancer activity was more strongly reduced. These results indicate that both Oct4 and Sox4 directly interact with the SOX2 enhancer region and synergistically induce Sox2 expression. As demonstrated here using glioma-initiating cells, Sox2 expression is also induced by Oct4 through interaction of Oct4 with the SOX2 enhancer region in embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, in embryonic stem cells, Sox2 is associated with Oct4 and the Oct4-Sox2 complex cooperatively activates the SOX2 enhancer region to form a positive regulatory loop (25Chew J.L. Loh Y.H.

Katayanagi T. Fukui N. Niwa H. Muramatsu M. Okuda A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3202-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To determine whether this regulatory loop exists in neural progenitor cells and glioma-initiating cells, we examined recruitment of these transcription factors to the SOX2 enhancer region in a ChIP assay (Fig. 7). Anti-Oct4 antibody enriched the DNA fragments of SOX2 enhancer region equally well in fetal neural progenitor cells and glioma-initiating cells. In addition, anti-Sox2 antibody immunoprecipitated this region in neural progenitor cells. However, strong enrichment of the same region by anti-Sox2 antibody was not observed in glioma-initiating cells. These results indicate that transcription factor complex on the SOX2 enhancer region does not contain Sox2 in glioma-initiating cells and that Sox2 expression in glioma-initiating cells is regulated by mechanisms different from those in fetal neural progenitor cells. We next examined recruitment of Sox4 to the SOX2 enhancer region in neural progenitor cells and glioma-initiating cells. In contrast to the experiment using anti-Sox2 antibody, anti-Sox4 antibody immunoprecipitated the DNA fragments of the SOX2 enhancer region in glioma-initiating cells, whereas the enrichment observed in fetal neural progenitor cells was much weaker. These findings together indicate that Sox2 expression in glioma-initiating cells is potentiated by the Oct4-Sox4 complex acting on the SOX2 enhancer region to maintain tumorigenic activity, whereas that in neural progenitor cells may be promoted by transcriptional complex containing Sox2 protein itself through a positive regulatory loop. Although the origin of glioma stem cells (or glioma-initiating cells) is controversial (27Sanai N. Alvarez-Buylla A. Berger M.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 811-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), several studies have suggested that glioma-initiating cells share characteristics with neural or glial stem/progenitor cells (28Stiles C.D. Rowitch D.H. Neuron. 2008; 58: 832-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 29Ben-Porath I. Thomson M.W. Carey V.J. Ge R. Bell G.W. Regev A. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar). Glioma stem cells express neural stem cell markers, including Nestin, Musashi, and Prominin-1 (CD133). Like normal neural stem cells, glioma stem cells are located in specific niches surrounding the tumor vasculature. A recent study has shown that the perivascular niches control self-renewal of glioma stem cells through endothelial cell-derived factors (30Calabrese C. Poppleton H. Kocak M. Hogg T.L. Fuller C. Hamner B. Oh E.Y. Gaber M.W. Finklestein D. Allen M. Frank A. Bayazitov I.T. Zakharenko S.S. Gajjar A. Davidoff A. Gilbertson R.J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 69-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). However, in terms of transcription factor complexes, the similarities and differences between glioma stem cells and neural stem cells have not been clearly determined. Here we have shown that Oct4 expression is required for the maintenance of the self-renewal capacity of glioma-initiating cells. In addition, transient suppression of Oct4 by siRNA abolished the induction of Sox2 by TGF-β 4H. Ikushima and K. Miyazono, unpublished observation. and decreased the tumorigenic activity of glioma-initiating cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that impairment of stemness properties via Oct4 knockdown may be an irreversible process. We also demonstrated that Oct4 knockdown increases sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic alkylating agent, temozolomide. Oct4 is essential for establishing and maintaining the pluripotent state of stem cells (14Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Schöler H. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar, 15Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar). Moreover, Oct4 is one of the key factors in the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (17Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19304) Google Scholar, 18Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15285) Google Scholar). However, the role of Oct4 in the development and progression of malignant tumors has not been fully determined. Our findings indicate that Oct4 is an essential factor for glioma-initiating cells and plays roles similar to those in embryonic stem cells. One of the most intensively investigated topics in current cancer research is the identification of specific therapeutic compounds that can effectively eliminate cancer-initiating cells. Recent studies have identified factors essential for retention of cancer-initiating cells, including several growth factor signaling pathways such as Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, PI3K-mTOR, TGF-β, and LIF (9Clement V.

Although new therapeutic targets have been intensively sought based on findings related to these pathways, one problem is that almost all of these signaling pathways are also indispensable for normal stem cells. Inhibitors of these signaling pathways may affect the characteristics of normal stem cells and impair maintenance of normal tissues. Thus, from a clinical standpoint, it is important to identify factors not only essential for the maintenance of cancer-initiating cells but also different from those present in normal stem cells. Here, we have demonstrated that Oct4-Sox4 complex activates the enhancer region of SOX2 genes to sustain stemness properties of glioma-initiating cells. Oct4 and Sox2 are also important for the maintenance of normal stem cells, and Oct4-Sox2 complex activates the SOX2 enhancer region to form a positive regulatory loop. However, in glioma-initiating cells, Sox2 is not predominantly present in the transcription factor complex on the SOX2 enhancer region. Instead, Sox4 forms a transcriptional complex with Oct4 in glioma-initiating cells to activate the enhancer region of SOX2, a gene essential for the maintenance of tumorigenicity of glioma-initiating cells. These findings suggest that Sox2 expression in glioma-initiating cells can be potentiated via up-regulation of Sox4, whereas Sox2 expression in neural progenitor cells is regulated by a self-reinforcing regulatory loop and is relatively self-contained (Fig. 7 and supplemental Fig. S5). In other words, the positive regulatory loop of Sox2 is not active in glioma-initiating cells, and alternatively, Oct4 acts with Sox4 to enhance Sox2 expression. We also confirmed that, in neural progenitor cells, Sox2 is only weakly induced by TGF-β stimulation (supplemental Fig. S6), whereas this cytokine activates the Sox4-Sox2 cascade in glioma-initiating cells (11Ikushima H. Todo T. Ino Y. Takahashi M. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 504-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Loss of the regulatory loop of Sox2 expression may thus cause glioma-initiating cells to become susceptible to exogenous stimuli. However, we should bear in mind that our glioma-initiating cells were obtained from adult tumors, whereas neural progenitor cells were from a fetus. Further studies in neural progenitor cells from adults may be important to elucidate the differences between glioma-initiating cells and normal neural progenitor cells. We examined combined effects of siRNAs against Sox4 and Oct4 in a limiting dilution assay but failed to observe any significant synergistic effects (supplemental Fig. S7). It may be because a defect of either factor in the Sox4-Oct4 complex results in significant inactivation of the SOX2 enhancer and/or because a single effect of siSox4 or siOct4 is strong enough to reduce sphere-forming ability of glioma-initiating cells. It remains to be determined why the common Oct4-binding sequence and Sox-binding elements are differently regulated in neural progenitor cells and glioma-initiating cells. Upon differentiation of erythroid precursors into mature erythrocytes, GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA2) on some promoter regions is replaced by GATA1 (37Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Pal S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This process is termed the “GATA switch” and is an essential step in the maturation of erythrocytes and the expression of α-globin. One of the crucial mediators of this switching is Friend of GATA1 (FOG-1, also known as Zfpm1), a multi-zinc-finger protein critical for the development of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes (38Tsang A.P. Fujiwara Y. Hom D.B. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1176-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 39Hong W. Nakazawa M. Chen Y.Y. Kori R. Vakoc C.R. Rakowski C. Blobel G.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2367-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and GATA-FOG interaction is believed to be required for “GATA switch” (40Jing H. Vakoc C.R. Ying L. Mandat S. Wang H. Zheng X. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 232-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Like the “GATA switch,” the Sox-binding element on SOX2 enhancer region in glioma-initiating cells is differently regulated from that in neural progenitor cells, although the mechanism responsible for this remains to be determined. Although Sox4 plays a crucial role in the retention of tumorigenicity of glioma-initiating cells through up-regulation of Sox2 expression (11Ikushima H. Todo T. Ino Y. Takahashi M. Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 504-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), Sox4−/− mice exhibit no neurological defects (41Schilham M.W. Oosterwegel M.A. Moerer P. Ya J. de Boer P.A. van de Wetering M. Verbeek S. Lamers W.H. Kruisbeek A.M. Cumano A. Clevers H. Nature. 1996; 380: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the mechanism of action of Sox4 in glioma-initiating cells is distinct from that in neural stem/precursor cells. Because the self-renewal and proliferation of normal stem cells are likely strictly regulated, perhaps by genetic or epigenetic programs, the uncontrolled expansion of cancer-initiating cells may result from deregulation of such strict programs. In support of this conclusion, we found that the self-regulatory loop of Sox2 expression observed in neural progenitor cells was disrupted in glioma-initiating cells. This finding may enable the determination of a novel molecular target and eventually yield a therapeutic approach to eradication of glioblastoma without affecting the normal brain.

https://openalex.org/W1967456281,"Several studies in recent years have provided evidence that Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a non-clonal population structure punctuated by highly successful epidemic clones or clonal complexes. The role of recombination in the diversification of P. aeruginosa clones has been suggested, but not yet demonstrated using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Isolates of P. aeruginosa from five Mediterranean countries (n = 141) were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), serotyping and PCR targeting the virulence genes exoS and exoU. The occurrence of multi-resistance (≥ 3 antipseudomonal drugs) was analyzed with disk diffusion according to EUCAST. MLST was performed on a subset of strains (n = 110) most of them had a distinct PFGE variant. MLST data were analyzed with Bionumerics 6.0, using minimal spanning tree (MST) as well as eBURST. Measurement of clonality was assessed by the standardized index of association (I(A) (S)). Evidence of recombination was estimated by ClonalFrame as well as SplitsTree4.0. The MST analysis connected 70 sequence types, among which ST235 was by far the most common. ST235 was very frequently associated with the O11 serotype, and frequently displayed multi-resistance and the virulence genotype exoS⁻/exoU⁺. ClonalFrame linked several groups previously identified by eBURST and MST, and provided insight to the evolutionary events occurring in the population; the recombination/mutation ratio was found to be 8.4. A Neighbor-Net analysis based on the concatenated sequences revealed a complex network, providing evidence of frequent recombination. The index of association when all the strains were considered indicated a freely recombining population. P. aeruginosa isolates from the Mediterranean countries display an epidemic population structure, particularly dominated by ST235-O11, which has earlier also been coupled to the spread of ß-lactamases in many countries."
https://openalex.org/W2005918516,"In the present study we analyzed the regulation of the two isoforms of the RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor Net1 by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in keratinocytes. We report that short-term TGF-β treatment selectively induced Net1 isoform2 (Net1A) but not Net1 isoform1. This led to upregulation of cytoplasmic Net1A protein levels that were necessary for TGF-β-mediated RhoA activation. Smad signaling and the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway were involved in Net1A upregulation by TGF-β. Interestingly, long-term TGF-β treatment resulted in Net1 mRNA downregulation and Net1A protein degradation by the proteasome. Furthermore, we identified the microRNA miR-24 as a novel post-transcriptional regulator of Net1A expression. Silencing of Net1A resulted in disruption of E-cadherin- and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1)-mediated junctions, as well as expression of the transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin, Slug and the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and fibronectin, indicating that late TGF-β-induced downregulation of Net1A is involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Finally, miR-24 was found to be implicated in the regulation of the EMT program in response to TGF-β and was shown to be directly involved in the TGF-β-induced breast cancer cell invasiveness through Net1A regulation. Our results emphasize the importance of Net1 isoform2 in the short- and long-term TGF-β-mediated regulation of EMT."
https://openalex.org/W1978421713,"Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) positively modulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. However, the mechanism(s) is not fully understood. Because the Wnt canonical pathway is important for bone homeostasis, this study focuses on modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling using Fgf2(-/-) mice (FGF2 all isoforms ablated), both in the absence of endogenous FGF2 and in the presence of exogenous FGF2. This study demonstrates a role of endogenous FGF2 in bone formation through Wnt signaling. Specifically, mRNA expression for the canonical Wnt genes Wnt10b, Lrp6, and β-catenin was decreased significantly in Fgf2(-/-) bone marrow stromal cells during osteoblast differentiation. In addition, a marked reduction of Wnt10b and β-catenin protein expression was observed in Fgf2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, Fgf2(-/-) osteoblasts displayed marked reduction of inactive phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β, a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin pathway as well as a significant decrease of Dkk2 mRNA, which plays a role in terminal osteoblast differentiation. Addition of exogenous FGF2 promoted β-catenin nuclear accumulation and further partially rescued decreased mineralization in Fgf2(-/-) bone marrow stromal cell cultures. Collectively, our findings suggest that FGF2 stimulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation is mediated in part by modulating the Wnt pathway."

Although the precise role of cholesterol catabolism in Mtb remains unclear, the Rieske monooxygenase in this pathway, 3-ketosteroid 9α-hydroxylase (KshAB), has been identified as a virulence factor. To investigate the physiological substrate of KshAB, a rhodococcal acyl-CoA synthetase was used to produce the coenzyme A thioesters of two cholesterol derivatives: 3-oxo-23,24-bisnorchol-4-en-22-oic acid (forming 4-BNC-CoA) and 3-oxo-23,24-bisnorchola-1,4-dien-22-oic acid (forming 1,4-BNC-CoA). The apparent specificity constant (kcat/Km) of KshAB for the CoA thioester substrates was 20–30 times that for the corresponding 17-keto compounds previously proposed as physiological substrates. The apparent KmO2 was 90 ± 10 μm in the presence of 1,4-BNC-CoA, consistent with the value for two other cholesterol catabolic oxygenases. The Δ1 ketosteroid dehydrogenase KstD acted with KshAB to cleave steroid ring B with a specific activity eight times greater for a CoA thioester than the corresponding ketone. Finally, modeling 1,4-BNC-CoA into the KshA crystal structure suggested that the CoA moiety binds in a pocket at the mouth of the active site channel and could contribute to substrate specificity. These results indicate that the physiological substrates of KshAB are CoA thioester intermediates of cholesterol side chain degradation and that side chain and ring degradation occur concurrently in Mtb.

Genetic knockouts of several of the cholesterol degradation genes have resulted not only in failure to grow on cholesterol in vitro but in attenuated pathogenicity in various infection models (9Pandey A.K.

One important aspect of cholesterol catabolism in Mtb that has yet to be established is the sequence of the side chain and ring degradation reactions with respect to each other. Metabolite accumulation studies for knockouts of kshA and kstD, encoding the ring-degrading enzymes 3-ketosteroid 9α-hydroxylase and Δ1 3-ketosteroid dehydrogenase, respectively, have suggested that the side chain is completely degraded to the 17-ketone before any significant ring degradation occurs (18Brzostek A.

Bacteriol. 2011; 193: 3931-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This conclusion was further supported by the accumulation of the 17-keto metabolites 4-androstene-3,17-dione (4-AD) and 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione (ADD) in the supernatant of Mtb cultures (11Nesbitt N.M. Yang X. Fontán P. Kolesnikova I. Smith I. Sampson N.S. Dubnau E. Infect. Immun. 2010; 78: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the order of particular reactions seems to be species-dependent. For example, 3β-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) of Mtb CDC1551 and Mycobacterium bovis BCG are able to transform cholesterol (21Ouellet H. Guan S. Johnston J.B. Chow E.D. Kells P.M.

Wilbrink M.H. Capyk J.K. Mohn W.W. Ostendorf M. van der Geize R. Dijkhuizen L. Eltis L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 74: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 3-Ketosteroid 9α-hydroxylase comprises a Rieske oxygenase, encoded by kshA, and a reductase, encoded by kshB (24van der Geize R. Hessels G.I. van Gerwen R. van der Meijden P. Dijkhuizen L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). KshAB utilizes O2 and NADH and acts in concert with KstD to effect opening of ring B and aromatization of ring A in the Mtb cholesterol degradation pathway (15Capyk J.K. D'Angelo I. Strynadka N.C.

Chem. 2009; 284: 9937-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have probed its substrate specificity, suggesting that ADD is its physiological substrate. Nonetheless, KshAB exhibits specificity constants for the 17-keto steroids 4-AD and ADD that are 2–3 orders of magnitude less than those of other characterized Rieske oxygenases (15Capyk J.K. D'Angelo I. Strynadka N.C. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9937-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Additionally, this enzyme exhibits an apparent KmO2 in excess of 1.2 mm in the presence of ADD. The relatively low reaction rates observed for KshAB have prompted speculation that the true physiological substrate for this enzyme may not be a 17-keto steroid but an intermediate of cholesterol side chain degradation (15Capyk J.K. D'Angelo I. Strynadka N.C. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9937-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Deleting either kshA or kshB completely abrogated the virulence of Mtb in several mouse and macrophage infection models, leading to the suggestion that the enzyme reaction product has an immunomodulatory function (17Hu Y. van der Geize R. Besra G.S. Gurcha S.S. Liu A. Rohde M. Singh M. Coates A. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 75: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Herein we explored the hypothesis that the physiological substrates for cholesterol ring-degrading enzymes are intermediates of side chain β-oxidation bearing a CoA thioester. CoA thioester derivatives of the 17-isopropionate 3-keto steroids 3-oxo-23,24-bisnorchol-4-en-22-oic acid (4-BNC) and 3-oxo-23,24-bisnorchola-1,4-dien-22-oic acid (1,4-BNC) (Fig. 2) were synthesized using a rhodococcal acyl-CoA synthetase (CasI) and KstD from Mtb. The BNCs and their CoA thioesters were used to elucidate the substrate specificity of KshAB. The enzyme substrate binding pocket was investigated using molecular modeling. The substrate preference of KstD was also investigated. The results are discussed in terms of microbial steroid catabolism and the pathogenesis of Mtb. ADD and 4-BNC were purchased from Steraloids, Inc. (Newport, RI). 4-AD was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Restriction enzymes and the Expand High Fidelity PCR System were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA) and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Oligonucleotides for amplifying kstD were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (San Diego, CA) through the Nucleic Acid Protein Service Unit at the University of British Columbia. All other reagents were of HPLC or analytical grade. Water for buffers was purified using a Barnstead Nanopure DiamondTM system (Dubuque, IA) to a resistivity of at least 18 megaohms. DNA was propagated, digested, ligated, and transformed using standard protocols (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified as described previously (27Pulleyblank D. Michalak M. Daisley S.L. Glick R. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 9: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and was used to transform Escherichia coli by electroporation using a MicroPulser from Bio-Rad with Bio-Rad 0.1-cm GenePulser Cuvettes. The kstD gene was amplified from Mtb H37Rv genomic DNA using forward and reverse primers with the sequences 5′-TACGCTAGCACTGTGCAGGAGTTCGACGTCG-3′ (the NheI site is underlined) and 5′-CAGAATTCTCAGCGCTTTCCCGCCTG-3′ (the EcoRI site is underlined), respectively. Polymerase chain reactions contained 20 ng of template DNA, 2 units of the Expand High Fidelity PCR System polymerase, 20 μm each of dNTP, and 30 pmol each of oligonucleotide in a volume of 100 μl. Reactions were subject to 22 temperature cycles using a Stratagene Robocycler Gradient 96 instrument (La Jolla, CA) as follows: 95 °C for 40 s, 55 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. The kstD amplicon was digested with NheI and EcoRI and ligated into pET-28a(+) (EMD) to yield pETKD1 such that the expressed protein was produced with an N-terminal thrombin-cleavable His6 tag. Nucleotide sequences were confirmed by the Nucleic Acid Protein Service Unit. KstD was produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells grown in LB with 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 20 °C and 200 rpm. Expression of kstD was induced using 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside when cells reached an A600 of 0.5. After 20 h, cells were harvested and washed by centrifugation. The cell pellet from 0.3 liters of culture was suspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.175 mg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and DNase I and subjected to five rounds of bead beating using an MP Biomedicals FastPrep-24 bead beater (Solon, OH) set to 5.0 for 20 s with 4 min on ice between rounds. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation (16,100 g × 10 min) at 4 °C. The supernatant, referred to hereafter as KstD-lysate, was separated from the pellet and kept on ice until use. CasI (Ro05822) and CasG (Ro05820) of R. jostii RHA1 were produced in E. coli RosettaTM (DE3)pLysS containing pETCasI and pETCasG.5 Cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm in 100 ml of LB supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Expression of the cas genes was induced using 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside when the culture attained an A600 of 0.6. The cells were incubated for a further 20 h at 16 °C and were then harvested by centrifugation. Pellets from 100 ml of culture were resuspended in 1 ml of 9 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 10% glycerol, the Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor mixture, and DNase I (Roche Applied Science) and then were lysed using a bead beater and centrifuged. Proteins were purified from the supernatant using a standard nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid protocol, exchanged into 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 50 mm potassium chloride by dialysis at 4 °C, and concentrated to ∼5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. Proteins were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. KshA and KshB were produced and purified as previously described (15Capyk J.K. D'Angelo I. Strynadka N.C. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9937-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). 4-BNC was dissolved to concentrations of 50 mm in 94% ethanol containing 60 mm NaOH. 4-AD, ADD, and 1,4-BNC were dissolved in ethanol up to 15 and 25 mm. CoA thioesters were stored and used as aqueous solutions up to 6 mm. To produce 3-oxo-23,24-bisnorchol-4-en-22-oyl-coenzyme A thioester (4-BNC-CoA), 5.52 μmol of 4-BNC was incubated with 0.75 mg of purified CasI for 7 h at 22 °C in 6 ml of 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 6.77 μmol of CoASH, 30 μmol of MgCl2, and 15 μmol of ATP. To produce 3-oxo-23,24-bisnorchola-1,4-dien-22-oyl-coenzyme A thioester (1,4-BNC-CoA), 3.02 μmol of 4-BNC-CoA was incubated with 0.6 mg (total protein) of KstD lysate for 2 h at 22 °C in 15 ml 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 6 μmol of NAD+. To produce 1,4-BNC, 4.06 μmol of 4-BNC was incubated with 5 mg (total protein) of KstD lysate for 23 h at 22 °C in 4 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 8 μmol of NAD+. The pH of the reaction solutions was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH or HCl (for reactions containing 4-BNC-CoA and 4-BNC, respectively) before the addition of KstD lysate. After incubation, reaction mixtures were diluted 1:1 with methanol and incubated on ice for 10 min. Methanol was evaporated at room temperature under low pressure using a Savant SC110A SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Electron Corp.). The mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C (16,000 g × 10 min). The supernatant was recovered, treated a second time with methanol as described above, filtered using a 0.2 μm PTFE filter unit (Millipore), and stored on ice. Compounds were chromatographically purified using a Waters 2695 Separations HPLC module (Milford, MA) equipped with a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector and a LUNA 3 μm PFP(2) 50 × 4.6-mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using a solvent system of 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 4.5 (Buffer A), and 90% methanol in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 4.5 (Buffer B). 500 μl (for 1,4-BNC) or 1 ml (for the CoA thioesters) of the reaction mixture was injected onto the column, which was equilibrated with Buffer A. Eluates were monitored at 248 nm. 4-BNC-CoA was eluted using a gradient of 0 to 100% Buffer B over 20 min at 1 ml/min (Gradient A). Under these conditions, the retention times for 4-BNC and 4-BNC-CoA were 18.7 and 16.7 min, respectively. 1,4-BNC and 1,4-BNC-CoA were eluted using a biphasic gradient consisting of 0 to 70% Buffer B at 1 ml/min over 14 min followed by 70 to 100% Buffer B at 0.5 ml/min over 12 min (Gradient B). Under these conditions, the retention times for 4-BNC, 1,4-BNC, 4-BNC-CoA, and 1,4-BNC-CoA were 24.3, 22.7, 19.8, and 18.0 min, respectively. Methanol was removed under nitrogen flow, and CoA thioesters were stored at −80 °C. Solutions of 1,4-BNC were lyophilized and stored at −80 °C. Reaction substrates and products were routinely verified by HPLC using the conditions described above. Reactions containing 4-AD and ADD were resolved using a gradient similar to Gradient A but at pH 5.0. Under these conditions the retention times for 4-AD and ADD were 17.1 and 16.2 min, respectively. CoA thioesters, including 3-hydroxy-9-oxo-9,10-seco-23,24-bisnorchola-1,3,5(10)-trien-22-oyl-CoA thioester (3-HSBNC-CoA) were identified by subjecting them to alkaline hydrolysis at pH 13 for 1 h at 50 °C. The solutions were then acidified to pH ∼ 4.5 with 6 m HCl and examined by HPLC to verify the generation of the corresponding steroid carboxylic acid and CoASH. Products from the hydrolyzed CoA thioester mixes were also extracted with ethyl acetate and dried. These compounds as well as purified 1,4-BNC were derivatized with trimethylsilyldiazomethane and subjected to gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS) performed using an HP 6890 series GC system fitted with an HP-5MS 30-m × 250-μm column (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) and an HP 5973 mass-selective detector. Additionally, purified samples of 4-BNC-CoA and 1,4-BNC-CoA were subjected to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) using a Bruker Esquire-LC ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI ion source, which was operated in the positive ion mode. Samples were dissolved 1:9 in methanol to a final concentration of 20–30 pmol/μl. Five μl were injected at a flow rate of 200 μl/min in 1:9 water:methanol. The scanned mass range was m/z 50–2000 Da. Steroid concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically using the following extinction coefficients for aqueous solutions at 22 °C: ϵ248 = 8,700 m−1 cm−1 for 4-BNC, ϵ248 = 8,500 m−1 cm−1 for 1,4-BNC, ϵ248 = 17,200 m−1 cm−1 for 4-BNC-CoA, and ϵ248 = 16,900 m−1 cm−1 for 1,4-BNC-CoA. The extinction coefficient for 4-BNC was measured using a solution containing a gravimetrically determined amount of the compound. That for 1,4-BNC was calculated from the ratios of values for 4-AD and ADD and for 4-AD and 4-BNC assuming a linear relationship for the contributions of the Δ1 bond and isopropionate group. The values for 4-BNC-CoA and 1,4-BNC-CoA were calculated from linear sums of the values for the steroid and CoA components. The extinction coefficients were validated in an oxygraph assay as described below. Steady-state kinetic analysis was performed for KshA using an oxygraph system as described previously (15Capyk J.K. D'Angelo I. Strynadka N.C. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9937-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Activity assays were performed at 22 °C in a total volume of 1 ml of air-saturated 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 430 μm NADH, 1.1 μm KshB, and 0.2 μm KshA. The reaction was initiated by adding substrate after equilibration of all other components for 3 min. The apparent steady-state kinetic parameters for O2 were measured in the presence of 57 μm 1,4-BNC-CoA. Kinetic parameters were evaluated by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data using the least-squares fitting and dynamic weighting options of LEONORA (28Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York1994Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 22 °C in a 1-ml volume containing 200 μm 4-AD or 4-BNC-CoA, 400 μm NAD+, and 0.04 mg (total protein) KstD-lysate in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. For reactions containing 4-BNC-CoA, the reaction pH was readjusted to 7.4 with NaOH before the addition of the KstD-lysate. At various time points, 200 μl of each reaction was stopped by rapid dilution into 200 μl of methanol, evaporated to remove methanol, filtered, and analyzed by HPLC. Models of 1,4-BNC and 1,4-BNC-CoA were generated using PRODRG (29Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4249) Google Scholar) and were docked to KshA (PDB 2ZYL) (15Capyk J.K. D'Angelo I. Strynadka N.C. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9937-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with AutoDock Vina (30Trott O. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2010; 31: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (7925) Google Scholar) using default parameters. A grid of 20 × 24 × 20 Å centered about the active site was defined as the searchable area for placement of the ligand. The top 10 docked ligand conformations were output, and the one with the lowest binding energy was chosen as the best structure. Two potential CoA thioester side chain degradation intermediates were generated to test the hypothesis that such compounds are the physiological substrates of KshAB. To generate the CoA thioesters, two acyl-CoA synthetases, CasI and CasG, from R. jostii RHA1 were tested for their ability to esterify 4-BNC. Transformation of 4-BNC and CoASH in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ by CasI resulted in the time-dependent depletion of all substrate peaks, and the formation of two new peaks resolved by HPLC using Gradient A (Fig. 3). The first product peak had the same retention time (2.8 min) and spectrum as an AMP standard. The second product peak eluted at 16.7 min and had a spectrum with features characteristic of both the steroid and CoA components. This product was purified and further characterized. Alkaline hydrolysis yielded 4-BNC and CoASH as determined by HPLC. The product identity of 4-BNC-CoA was confirmed by electrospray ionization-MS (supplemental Fig. 1A). Under the described reaction conditions, the product yield was typically 75%. By contrast, CasG did not detectably catalyze the thioesterification of 4-BNC. To generate 1,4-BNC-CoA, purified 4-BNC-CoA was incubated with lysate from cells containing KstD of Mtb. KstD has previously been shown to catalyze the Δ1-dehydrogenation of 4-AD, 6J. K. Capyk and L. D. Eltis, unpublished observations. 5α-androstane-3,17-dione, 5α-testosterone, and progesterone (31Knol J. Bodewits K. Hessels G.I. Dijkhuizen L. van der Geize R. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Monitoring of the reaction by HPLC revealed a decrease in the 4-BNC-CoA peak and appearance of a new peak eluting at 18 min of Gradient B. This compound was analyzed as described above and identified as 1,4-BNC-CoA (supplemental Fig. 1B). Transformation of 4-BNC-CoA to 1,4-BNC-CoA by incubation with KstD-lysate resulted in 87% conversion after 2 h. A greater total yield of 1,4-BNC-CoA could be obtained by adding KstD-lysate and NAD+ directly to the CasI reaction mixture after 3 h, omitting the intermediate purification step. Transformation of 4-BNC to 1,4-BNC by incubation with KstD-lysate using a similar procedure resulted in a >90% turnover after 23 h. The product identity was confirmed by GC-MS analysis (supplemental Fig. 1C). Consistent with KshAB of Mtb catalyzing the 9α-hydroxylation of 4-AD and ADD (15Capyk J.K. D'Angelo I. Strynadka N.C. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9937-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), each of 4-BNC, 1,4-BNC, 4-BNC-CoA, and 1,4-BNC-CoA stimulated the depletion of oxygen in the presence of KshA, KshB, and NADH in the standard oxygen electrode activity assay. For each steroid substrate, the amount of oxygen consumed corresponded with the calculated amount of substrate added. These data are consistent with full coupling between oxygen and steroid substrate consumption and indicate that the extinction coefficients calculated for each of 1,4-BNC, 4-BNC-CoA, and 1,4-BNC-CoA are accurate. To confirm that KshAB catalyzes the 9α-hydroxylation of the thioester substrates, a rea"

Purpose of this study was to characterize the localization and time course of contrast enhancement of a nanoparticular alkaline earth metal-based contrast agent (VISCOVER ExiTron nano) developed for small animal liver CT imaging.ExiTron nano 6000 and ExiTron nano 12000, formulated for liver/spleen imaging and angiography, respectively, were intravenously injected in C57BL/6J-mice. The distribution and time course of contrast enhancement were analysed by repeated micro-CT up to 6 months. Finally, mice developing liver metastases after intrasplenic injection of colon carcinoma cells underwent longitudinal micro-CT imaging after a single injection of ExiTron nano.After a single injection of ExiTron nano the contrast of liver and spleen peaked after 4-8 hours, lasted up to several months and was tolerated well by all mice. In addition, strong contrast enhancement of abdominal and mediastinal lymph nodes and the adrenal glands was observed. Within the first two hours after injection, particularly ExiTron nano 12000 provided pronounced contrast for imaging of vascular structures. ExiTron nano facilitated detection of liver metastases and provided sufficient contrast for longitudinal observation of tumor development over weeks.The nanoparticulate contrast agents ExiTron nano 6000 and 12000 provide strong contrast of the liver, spleen, lymph nodes and adrenal glands up to weeks, hereby allowing longitudinal monitoring of pathological processes of these organs in small animals, with ExiTron nano 12000 being particularly optimized for angiography due to its very high initial vessel contrast."
https://openalex.org/W1963700571,"Studies on the stem cell niche and the efficacy of cancer therapeutics require complex multicellular structures and interactions between different cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM) in three dimensional (3D) space. We have engineered a 3D in vitro model of mammary gland that encompasses a defined, porous collagen/hyaluronic acid (HA) scaffold forming a physiologically relevant foundation for epithelial and adipocyte co-culture. Polarized ductal and acinar structures form within this scaffold recapitulating normal tissue morphology in the absence of reconstituted basement membrane (rBM) hydrogel. Furthermore, organoid developmental outcome can be controlled by the ratio of collagen to HA, with a higher HA concentration favouring acinar morphological development. Importantly, this culture system recapitulates the stem cell niche as primary mammary stem cells form complex organoids, emphasising the utility of this approach for developmental and tumorigenic studies using genetically altered animals or human biopsy material, and for screening cancer therapeutics for personalised medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1981281869,"Protein ubiquitination is a key regulatory process essential to life at a cellular level; significant efforts have been made to identify ubiquitinated proteins through proteomics studies, but the level of success has not reached that of heavily studied post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. HRD1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis, but no disease-relevant substrates have been identified. To identify these substrates, we have taken both peptide and protein level approaches to enrich for ubiquitinated proteins in the presence and absence of HRD1. At the protein level, a two-step strategy was taken using cells expressing His(6)-tagged ubiquitin, enriching proteins first based on their ubiquitination and second based on the His tag with protein identification by LC-MS/MS. Application of this method resulted in identification and quantification of more than 400 ubiquitinated proteins, a fraction of which were found to be sensitive to HRD1 and were therefore deemed candidate substrates. In a second approach, ubiquitinated peptides were enriched after tryptic digestion by peptide immunoprecipitation using an antibody specific for the diglycine-labeled internal lysine residue indicative of protein ubiquitination, with peptides and ubiquitination sites identified by LC-MS/MS. Peptide immunoprecipitation resulted in identification of over 1800 ubiquitinated peptides on over 900 proteins in each study, with several proteins emerging as sensitive to HRD1 levels. Notably, significant overlap exists between the HRD1 substrates identified by the protein-based and the peptide-based strategies, with clear cross-validation apparent both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating the effectiveness of both strategies and furthering our understanding of HRD1 biology."
https://openalex.org/W2003051170,"Background Expansion of beta cells from the limited number of adult human islet donors is an attractive prospect for increasing cell availability for cell therapy of diabetes. However, attempts at expanding human islet cells in tissue culture result in loss of beta-cell phenotype. Using a lineage-tracing approach we provided evidence for massive proliferation of beta-cell-derived (BCD) cells within these cultures. Expansion involves dedifferentiation resembling epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Epigenetic analyses indicate that key beta-cell genes maintain open chromatin structure in expanded BCD cells, although they are not transcribed. Here we investigated whether BCD cells can be redifferentiated into beta-like cells. Methodology/Principal Finding Redifferentiation conditions were screened by following activation of an insulin-DsRed2 reporter gene. Redifferentiated cells were characterized for gene expression, insulin content and secretion assays, and presence of secretory vesicles by electron microscopy. BCD cells were induced to redifferentiate by a combination of soluble factors. The redifferentiated cells expressed beta-cell genes, stored insulin in typical secretory vesicles, and released it in response to glucose. The redifferentiation process involved mesenchymal-epithelial transition, as judged by changes in gene expression. Moreover, inhibition of the EMT effector SLUG (SNAI2) using shRNA resulted in stimulation of redifferentiation. Lineage-traced cells also gave rise at a low rate to cells expressing other islet hormones, suggesting transition of BCD cells through an islet progenitor-like stage during redifferentiation. Conclusions/Significance These findings demonstrate for the first time that expanded dedifferentiated beta cells can be induced to redifferentiate in culture. The findings suggest that ex-vivo expansion of adult human islet cells is a promising approach for generation of insulin-producing cells for transplantation, as well as basic research, toxicology studies, and drug screening."
https://openalex.org/W2004623249,"Background The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and its southern and southeastern mountain ranges, Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains (HHM), are one of the most extensive habitats for alpine plants in the world. How ferns occurring in QTP and HHM changed their distribution ranges in response to Quaternary climatic oscillations remains almost unknown. Methodology and Results We employed sequences of two chloroplast DNA regions, rps4-trnS and trnL-trnF, to reconstruct phylogeography of the Sino-Himalayan fern Lepisorus clathratus, occurring mainly in the QTP and HHM. Individuals of this species have either dehiscent or indehiscent sporangia with the latter evolved from the plesiomorphic dehiscent forms. Based on a range-wide sampling, we detected 27 cpDNA haplotypes that were divided into five groups by network analyses. Populations in the Hengduan Mountains possess the highest genetic diversity, while a single haplogroup is detected across the north-central region. A distinct phylogeographical subdivision was detected between the Hengduan Mountains and north-central region by AMOVA analysis. The haplogroup distribution pattern, coalescence and AMOVA analysis suggest that a long term survival area (refugia) of the species was located in the Hengduan Mountains during glaciations, with probable range expansions into north-central regions during interglacial periods. Populations with indehiscent sporangium can carry private haplotypes and are inclined to maintain genetic homogeneity. One group with indehiscent sporangia most likely survived in situ on the QTP during glaciations. Conclusions/Significance This study for the first time sheds light on the response of alpine ferns in the QTP and HHM to the Quaternary climatic oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W2153043611,"Memory formation is modulated by pre- and post-synaptic signaling events in neurons. The neuronal protein kinase Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylates a variety of synaptic substrates and is implicated in memory formation. It has also been shown to play a role in homeostatic regulation of synaptic plasticity in cultured neurons. Surprisingly, we found that Cdk5 loss of function in hippocampal circuits results in severe impairments in memory formation and retrieval. Moreover, Cdk5 loss of function in the hippocampus disrupts cAMP signaling due to an aberrant increase in phosphodiesterase (PDE) proteins. Dysregulation of cAMP is associated with defective CREB phosphorylation and disrupted composition of synaptic proteins in Cdk5-deficient mice. Rolipram, a PDE4 inhibitor that prevents cAMP depletion, restores synaptic plasticity and memory formation in Cdk5-deficient mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate a critical role for Cdk5 in the regulation of cAMP-mediated hippocampal functions essential for synaptic plasticity and memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W2109591857,"L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is a troublesome complication of L-DOPA pharmacotherapy of Parkinson's disease and has been associated with disturbed brain opioid transmission. However, so far the results of clinical and preclinical studies on the effects of opioids agonists and antagonists have been contradictory at best. Prodynorphin mRNA levels correlate well with the severity of dyskinesia in animal models of Parkinson's disease; however the identities of the actual neuroactive opioid effectors in their target basal ganglia output structures have not yet been determined. For the first time MALDI-TOF imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) was used for unbiased assessment and topographical elucidation of prodynorphin-derived peptides in the substantia nigra of a unilateral rat model of Parkinson's disease and L-DOPA induced dyskinesia. Nigral levels of dynorphin B and alpha-neoendorphin strongly correlated with the severity of dyskinesia. Even if dynorphin peptide levels were elevated in both the medial and lateral part of the substantia nigra, MALDI IMS analysis revealed that the most prominent changes were localized to the lateral part of the substantia nigra. MALDI IMS is advantageous compared with traditional molecular methods, such as radioimmunoassay, in that neither the molecular identity analyzed, nor the specific localization needs to be predetermined. Indeed, MALDI IMS revealed that the bioconverted metabolite leu-enkephalin-arg also correlated positively with severity of dyskinesia. Multiplexing DynB and leu-enkephalin-arg ion images revealed small (0.25 by 0.5 mm) nigral subregions with complementing ion intensities, indicating localized peptide release followed by bioconversion. The nigral dynorphins associated with L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia were not those with high affinity to kappa opioid receptors, but consisted of shorter peptides, mainly dynorphin B and alpha-neoendorphin that are known to bind and activate mu and delta opioid receptors. This suggests that mu and/or delta subtype-selective opioid receptor antagonists may be clinically relevant for reducing L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2088283539,"Mutations of p53 in cancer can result in a gain of function associated with tumour progression and metastasis. We show that inducible expression of several p53 ‘hotspot’ mutants promote a range of centrosome abnormalities, including centrosome amplification, increased centrosome size and loss of cohesion, which lead to mitotic defects and multinucleation. These mutant p53-expressing cells also show a change in morphology and enhanced invasive capabilities. Consequently, we sought for a means to specifically target the function of mutant p53 in cancer cells. This study has identified ANKRD11 as a key regulator of the oncogenic potential of mutant p53. Loss of ANKRD11 expression with p53 mutation defines breast cancer patients with poor prognosis. ANKRD11 alleviates the mitotic defects driven by mutant p53 and suppresses mutant p53-mediated mesenchymal-like transformation and invasion. Mechanistically, we show that ANKRD11 restores a native conformation to the mutant p53 protein and causes dissociation of the mutant p53–p63 complex. This represents the first evidence of an endogenous protein with the capacity to suppress the oncogenic properties of mutant p53."
https://openalex.org/W2002951343,"The tellurium oxyanion tellurite induces oxidative stress in most microorganisms. In Escherichia coli, tellurite exposure results in high levels of oxidized proteins and membrane lipid peroxides, inactivation of oxidation-sensitive enzymes and reduced glutathione content. In this work, we show that tellurite-exposed E. coli exhibits transcriptional activation of the zwf gene, encoding glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), which in turn results in augmented synthesis of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Increased zwf transcription under tellurite stress results mainly from reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and not from a depletion of cellular glutathione. In addition, the observed increase of G6PDH activity was paralleled by accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), suggesting a metabolic flux shift toward the pentose phosphate shunt. Upon zwf overexpression, bacterial cells also show increased levels of antioxidant molecules (NADPH, GSH), better-protected oxidation-sensitive enzymes and decreased amounts of oxidized proteins and membrane lipids. These results suggest that by increasing NADPH content, G6PDH plays an important role in E. coli survival under tellurite stress."
https://openalex.org/W1987018519,"In human-altered environments, organisms may preferentially settle in poor-quality habitats where fitness returns are lower relative to available higher-quality habitats. Such ecological trapping is due to a mismatch between the cues used during habitat selection and the habitat quality. Maladaptive settlement decisions may occur when organisms are time-constrained and have to rapidly evaluate habitat quality based on incomplete knowledge of the resources and conditions that will be available later in the season. During a three-year study, we examined settlement decision-making in the long-distance migratory, open-habitat bird, the Red-backed shrike (Lanius collurio), as a response to recent land-use changes. In Northwest Europe, the shrikes typically breed in open areas under a management regime of extensive farming. In recent decades, Spruce forests have been increasingly managed with large-size cutblocks in even-aged plantations, thereby producing early-successional vegetation areas that are also colonised by the species. Farmland and open areas in forests create mosaics of two different types of habitats that are now occupied by the shrikes. We examined redundant measures of habitat preference (order of settlement after migration and distribution of dominant individuals) and several reproductive performance parameters in both habitat types to investigate whether habitat preference is in line with habitat quality. Territorial males exhibited a clear preference for the recently created open areas in forests with higher-quality males settling in this habitat type earlier. Reproductive performance was, however, higher in farmland, with higher nest success, offspring quantity, and quality compared to open areas in forests. The results showed strong among-year consistency and we can therefore exclude a transient situation. This study demonstrates a case of maladaptive habitat selection in a farmland bird expanding its breeding range to human-created open habitats in plantations. We discuss the reasons that could explain this decision-making and the possible consequences for the population dynamics and persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2055169387,"Accumulating evidence indicates that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-derived prostaglandin (PG) E2 is involved in the development of various tumors, including colorectal cancer. However, the precise contribution of microsomal PGE synthase (mPGES)-1, a terminal enzyme that acts downstream of COX-2 in the PGE2-biosynthetic pathway, to multiple processes of tumor development is not yet fully understood. Here, we show the pro-tumorigenic role of mPGES-1 in chemical carcinogen-induced colon carcinogenesis and intrasplenic tumor transplantation models. Genetic deletion of mPGES-1 significantly reduced both the total number and size of colorectal polyps at 18 weeks after azoxymethane administration with reduced nuclear translocation of β-catenin, altered expression profiles of chemokines/cytokines and increased production of antitumorigenic PGs, prostaglandin D2 and prostacyclin in tumor tissues. At an early stage (6 weeks), mPGES-1 deficiency significantly reduced the number of aberrant crypt foci, while its transgenic overexpression increased the number. Furthermore, the growth of intrasplenically transplanted tumor cells was suppressed in mPGES-1 knockout (KO) mice. Co-culture of tumor cells with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM-MΦs) isolated from wild-type (WT) mice resulted in the induction of mPGES-1 in BM-MΦs and increased the growth of tumor cells in vitro, whereas mPGES-1-null BM-MΦs failed to facilitate tumor growth. The adoptive transfer of WT BM-MΦs into mPGES-1 KO mice restored the growth of transplanted tumor cells, indicating that mPGES-1 in MΦs is important for the growth of adjacent tumor cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that the inhibition of mPGES-1 is an alternative therapeutic target for colorectal and possibly other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2011905648,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high throughput DNA Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for genome wide profiling of the binding sites of proteins associated with DNA such as histones and transcription factors. However, no peak calling program has gained consensus acceptance by the scientific community as the preferred tool for ChIP-Seq data analysis. Analyzing the large data sets generated by ChIP-Seq studies remains highly challenging for most molecular biology laboratories.Here we profile H3K27me3 enrichment sites in rice young endosperm using the ChIP-Seq approach and analyze the data using four peak calling algorithms (FindPeaks, PeakSeq, USeq, and MACS). Comparison of the four algorithms reveals that these programs produce very different peaks in terms of peak size, number, and position relative to genes. We verify the peak predictions using ChIP-PCR to evaluate the accuracy of peak prediction of the four algorithms. We discuss the approach of each algorithm and compare similarities and differences in the results. Despite their differences in the peaks identified, all of the programs reach similar conclusions about the effect of H3K27me3 on gene expression. Its presence either upstream or downstream of a gene is predominately associated with repression of the gene. Additionally, GO analysis finds that a substantially higher ratio of genes associated with H3K27me3 were involved in multicellular organism development, signal transduction, response to external and endogenous stimuli, and secondary metabolic pathways than the rest of the rice genome."
https://openalex.org/W2038722548,"Targeting altered cancer cell metabolism with the glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), is a viable therapeutic strategy, but the effects of 2DG on lymphoma cells and the mechanism of action are unknown. Five T-cell lymphoma lines and two B-cell lymphoma lines were shown to be highly sensitive to 2DG. Examination of the cell death pathway demonstrated pro-apoptotic protein Bax ‘activation’ and caspase cleavage in 2DG-treated cells. However, Q-VD-OPh, a potent inhibitor of caspase activity provided minimal protection from death. In contrast, overexpressing the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 dramatically enhanced the survival of 2DG-treated cells that was negated by a Bcl-2 antagonist. BH3-only members, Bim and Bmf, were upregulated by 2DG, and shRNAs targeting Bim protected from 2DG toxicity demonstrating that Bim is a critical mediator of 2DG toxicity. 2DG also induced GADD153/CHOP expression, a marker of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and a known activator of Bim. Mannose, a reagent known to alleviate ER stress, transiently protected from 2DG-induced cell death. Examination of the effects of 2DG on energy metabolism showed a drop in ATP levels by 30 min that was not affected by either Bcl-2 or mannose. These results demonstrate that ER stress appears to be rate limiting in 2DG-induced cell death in lymphoma cells, and this cell killing is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Bcl-2 inhibition combined with 2DG may be an effective therapeutic strategy for lymphoma."
https://openalex.org/W2063687423,"Dysregulation of β-catenin turnover due to mutations of its regulatory proteins including adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and p53 is implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer. Thus, intensive effort is being made to search for alternative approaches to reduce abnormally activated β-catenin in cancer cells. Nur77, an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, has a role in the growth and apoptosis of cancer cells. Here, we reported that Nur77 could inhibit transcriptional activity of β-catenin by inducing β-catenin degradation via proteasomal degradation pathway that is glycogen synthase kinase 3β and Siah-1 independent. Nur77 induction of β-catenin degradation required both the N-terminal region of Nur77, which was involved in Nur77 ubiquitination, and the C-terminal region, which was responsible for β-catenin binding. Nur77/ΔDBD, a Nur77 mutant lacking its DNA-binding domain, resided in the cytoplasm, interacted with β-catenin, and induced β-catenin degradation, demonstrating that Nur77-mediated β-catenin degradation was independent of its DNA binding and transactivation, and might occur in the cytoplasm. In addition, we reported our identification of two digitalis-like compounds (DLCs), H-9 and ATE-i2-b4, which potently induced Nur77 expression and β-catenin degradation in SW620 colon cancer cells expressing mutant APC protein in vitro and in animals. DLC-induced Nur77 protein was mainly found in the cytoplasm, and inhibition of Nur77 nuclear export by the CRM1-dependent nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B or Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor prevented the effect of DLC on inducing β-catenin degradation. Together, our results demonstrate that β-catenin can be degraded by cytoplasmic Nur77 through their interaction and identify H-9 and ATE-i2-b4 as potent activators of the Nur77-mediated pathway for β-catenin degradation."

It was hypothesised that repeated delivery of gp140 may facilitate antigen uptake and presentation at this mucosal surface. Twenty two healthy female volunteers aged 18-45 years were entered into the trial, the first receiving open-label active product. Subsequently, 16 women were randomised to receive 9 doses of 100 µg of gp140 in 3 ml of a Carbopol 974P based gel, 5 were randomised to placebo solution in the same gel, delivered vaginally via an applicator. Participants delivered the vaccine three times a week over three weeks during one menstrual cycle, and were followed up for two further months. There were no serious adverse events, and the vaccine was well tolerated. No sustained systemic or local IgG, IgA, or T cell responses to the gp140 were detected following vaginal immunisations. Repeated vaginal immunisation with a HIV-1 envelope protein alone formulated in Carbopol gel was safe, but did not induce local or systemic immune responses in healthy women.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00637962."
https://openalex.org/W2017695022,"Increased activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members such as HER2/Erbb2 can result in more aggressive disease, resistance to chemotherapy and reduced survival of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. In order to identify mechanisms through which these receptor tyrosine kinases accelerate tumor progression, the regulation of metalloprotease expression by EGFR family members was investigated in 11 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines. HER2 expression was significantly correlated with ADAM12 (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 12) expression in these cell lines and was co-expressed in human head and neck cancers. Inhibition of HER2 or EGFR decreased ADAM12 transcripts whereas HER2 transfection upregulated ADAM12 expression. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying HER2 regulation of ADAM12, we investigated the signaling pathways directing ADAM12 production in SCC cells. Inhibition of phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase or mammalian target of rapamycin decreased ADAM12 transcripts in HER2-expressing SCC cells, whereas transfection with AKT increased ADAM12 mRNA. Experiments utilizing ADAM12 transfection or siRNA targeting of ADAM12 revealed that the protease increased both the migration and invasiveness of oral SCC cells. Surprisingly, ADAM12 also increased HER2 message, protein levels and activity through an Ets1-dependent mechanism. Collectively, these results reveal a novel positive activation loop between ADAM12 and HER2 that may contribute to HNSCC progression."
https://openalex.org/W2033048095,"Efficient intracellular Ca²⁺ ([Ca²⁺]i) homeostasis in skeletal muscle requires intact triad junctional complexes comprised of t-tubule invaginations of plasma membrane and terminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Bin1 consists of a specialized BAR domain that is associated with t-tubule development in skeletal muscle and involved in tethering the dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR) to the t-tubule. Here, we show that Bin1 is important for Ca²⁺ homeostasis in adult skeletal muscle. Since systemic ablation of Bin1 in mice results in postnatal lethality, in vivo electroporation mediated transfection method was used to deliver RFP-tagged plasmid that produced short -hairpin (sh)RNA targeting Bin1 (shRNA-Bin1) to study the effect of Bin1 knockdown in adult mouse FDB skeletal muscle. Upon confirming the reduction of endogenous Bin1 expression, we showed that shRNA-Bin1 muscle displayed swollen t-tubule structures, indicating that Bin1 is required for the maintenance of intact membrane structure in adult skeletal muscle. Reduced Bin1 expression led to disruption of t-tubule structure that was linked with alterations to intracellular Ca²⁺ release. Voltage-induced Ca²⁺ released in isolated single muscle fibers of shRNA-Bin1 showed that both the mean amplitude of Ca²⁺ current and SR Ca²⁺ transient were reduced when compared to the shRNA-control, indicating compromised coupling between DHPR and ryanodine receptor 1. The mean frequency of osmotic stress induced Ca²⁺ sparks was reduced in shRNA-Bin1, indicating compromised DHPR activation. ShRNA-Bin1 fibers also displayed reduced Ca²⁺ sparks' amplitude that was attributed to decreased total Ca²⁺ stores in the shRNA-Bin1 fibers. Human mutation of Bin1 is associated with centronuclear myopathy and SH3 domain of Bin1 is important for sarcomeric protein organization in skeletal muscle. Our study showing the importance of Bin1 in the maintenance of intact t-tubule structure and ([Ca²⁺]i) homeostasis in adult skeletal muscle could provide mechanistic insight on the potential role of Bin1 in skeletal muscle contractility and pathology of myopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2086225810,"Glycosylation of flagellins by pseudaminic acid is required for virulence in Helicobacter pylori. We demonstrate that, in H. pylori, glycosylation extends to proteins other than flagellins and to sugars other than pseudaminic acid. Several candidate glycoproteins distinct from the flagellins were detected via ProQ-emerald staining and DIG- or biotin- hydrazide labeling of the soluble and outer membrane fractions of wild-type H. pylori, suggesting that protein glycosylation is not limited to the flagellins. DIG-hydrazide labeling of proteins from pseudaminic acid biosynthesis pathway mutants showed that the glycosylation of some glycoproteins is not dependent on the pseudaminic acid glycosylation pathway, indicating the existence of a novel glycosylation pathway. Fractions enriched in glycoprotein candidates by ion exchange chromatography were used to extract the sugars by acid hydrolysis. High performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection revealed characteristic monosaccharide peaks in these extracts. The monosaccharides were then identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The spectra are consistent with sugars such as 5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-L-glycero-L-manno-nonulosonic acid (Pse5Ac7Ac) previously described on flagellins, 5-acetamidino-7-acetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-L-glycero-L-manno-nonulosonic acid (Pse5Am7Ac), bacillosamine derivatives and a potential legionaminic acid derivative (Leg5AmNMe7Ac) which were not previously identified in H. pylori. These data open the way to the study of the mechanism and role of protein glycosylation on protein function and virulence in H. pylori."
https://openalex.org/W1981687292,"Role of immune system in protecting the host from cancer is well established. Growing cancer however subverts immune response towards Th2 type and escape from antitumor mechanism of the host. Activation of both innate and Th1 type response is crucial for host antitumor activity. In our previous study it was found, that Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) also known as M. w induces Th1 type response and activates macrophages in animal model of tuberculosis. Hence, we studied the immunotherapeutic potential of MIP in mouse tumor model and the underlying mechanisms for its antitumor activity.Tumors were implanted by injecting B16F10 melanoma cells subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice. Using the optimized dose and treatment regimes, anti-tumor efficacy of heat killed MIP was evaluated. In MIP treated group, tumor appeared in only 50-60% of mice, tumor growth was delayed and tumor volume was less as compared to control. MIP mediated immune activation was analysed in the tumor microenvironment, tumor draining lymph node and spleen. Induction of Th1 response and higher infiltration of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment was observed in MIP treated mice. A large fraction of these immune cells were in activated state as confirmed by phenotypic and functional analysis. Interestingly, percentage of Treg cells in the tumor milieu of treated mice was less. We also evaluated efficacy of MIP along with chemotherapy and found a better response as compared to chemotherapy alone.MIP therapy is effective in protecting mice from tumor. It activates the immune cells, increases their infiltration in tumor, and abrogates tumor mediated immune suppression."

The data needed to calculate measures of lake morphometry, particularly lake depth, are usually collected on a lake-by-lake basis and are difficult to obtain across broad regions. To span the gap between studies of individual lakes where detailed data exist and regional studies where access to useful data on lake depth is unavailable, we developed a method to predict maximum lake depth from the slope of the topography surrounding a lake. We use the National Elevation Dataset and the National Hydrography Dataset – Plus to estimate the percent slope of surrounding lakes and use this information to predict maximum lake depth. We also use field measured maximum lake depths from the US EPA's National Lakes Assessment to empirically adjust and cross-validate our predictions. We were able to predict maximum depth for ∼28,000 lakes in the Northeastern United States with an average cross-validated RMSE of 5.95 m and 5.09 m and average correlation of 0.82 and 0.69 for Hydrological Unit Code Regions 01 and 02, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2005566060,"The transcription factor Sox4 is aberrantly expressed in many human tumors and can modulate tumorigenesis and metastases of murine tumors in vivo. However, mechanisms that control Sox4 function remain poorly defined. It has recently been observed that DNA damage increases Sox4 protein expression independently of Sox4 mRNA levels, suggesting an as yet undefined post-transcriptional mechanism regulating Sox4 expression and functionality. Here, we show that Sox4 protein is rapidly degraded by the proteasome as indicated by pharmacological inhibition with Mg132 and epoxymycin. Sox4 half-life was found to be less than 1 h as evident by inhibition of protein synthesis using cycloheximide. Ectopic expression of Sox4 deletion mutants revealed that the C-terminal 33 residues of Sox4 were critical in modulating its degradation in a polyubiquitin-independent manner. Syntenin, a Sox4 binding partner, associates with this domain and was found to stabilize Sox4 expression. Syntenin-induced stabilization of Sox4 correlated with Sox4-syntenin relocalization to the nucleus, where both proteins accumulate. Syntenin overexpression or knockdown in human tumor cell lines was found to reciprocally modulate Sox4 protein expression and transcriptional activity implicating its role as a regulator of Sox4. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the Sox4 C-terminal domain regulates polyubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of Sox4 that can be modulated by interaction with syntenin. As aberrant Sox4 expression has been found associated with many human cancers, modulation of Sox4 proteasomal degradation may impact oncogenesis and metastatic properties of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2002155237,"Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), the first identified histone demethylase, is a flavin-dependent amine oxidase which specifically demethylates mono- or dimethylated H3K4 and H3K9 via a redox process. It participates in a broad spectrum of biological processes and is of high importance in cell proliferation, adipogenesis, spermatogenesis, chromosome segregation and embryonic development. To date, as a potential drug target for discovering anti-tumor drugs, the medical significance of LSD1 has been greatly appreciated. However, the catalytic mechanism for the rate-limiting reductive half-reaction in demethylation remains controversial. By employing a combined computational approach including molecular modeling, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations, the catalytic mechanism of dimethylated H3K4 demethylation by LSD1 was characterized in details. The three-dimensional (3D) model of the complex was composed of LSD1, CoREST, and histone substrate. A 30-ns MD simulation of the model highlights the pivotal role of the conserved Tyr761 and lysine-water-flavin motif in properly orienting flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) with respect to substrate. The synergy of the two factors effectively stabilizes the catalytic environment and facilitated the demethylation reaction. On the basis of the reasonable consistence between simulation results and available mutagenesis data, QM/MM strategy was further employed to probe the catalytic mechanism of the reductive half-reaction in demethylation. The characteristics of the demethylation pathway determined by the potential energy surface and charge distribution analysis indicates that this reaction belongs to the direct hydride transfer mechanism. Our study provides insights into the LSD1 mechanism of reductive half-reaction in demethylation and has important implications for the discovery of regulators against LSD1 enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2063410660,"Clinical observations and neuroimaging data revealed a right-hemisphere fronto-parietal-thalamic-brainstem network for intrinsic alertness, and additional left fronto-parietal activity during phasic alertness. The primary objective of this fMRI study was to map the functional neuroanatomy of intrinsic alertness as precisely as possible in healthy participants, using a novel assessment paradigm already employed in clinical settings. Both the paradigm and the experimental design were optimized to specifically assess intrinsic alertness, while at the same time controlling for sensory-motor processing. The present results suggest that the processing of intrinsic alertness is accompanied by increased activity within the brainstem, thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus, right insula, and right parietal cortex. Additionally, we found increased activation in the left hemisphere around the middle frontal gyrus (BA 9), the insula, the supplementary motor area, and the cerebellum. Our results further suggest that rather minute aspects of the experimental design may induce aspects of phasic alertness, which in turn might lead to additional brain activation in left-frontal areas not normally involved in intrinsic alertness. Accordingly, left BA 9 activation may be related to co-activation of the phasic alertness network due to the switch between rest and task conditions functioning as an external warning cue triggering the phasic alertness network. Furthermore, activation of the intrinsic alertness network during fixation blocks due to enhanced expectancy shortly before the switch to the task block might, when subtracted from the task block, lead to diminished activation in the typical right hemisphere intrinsic alertness network. Thus, we cautiously suggest that--as a methodological artifact--left frontal activations might show up due to phasic alertness involvement and intrinsic alertness activations might be weakened due to contrasting with fixation blocks, when assessing the functional neuroanatomy of intrinsic alertness with a block design in fMRI studies."
https://openalex.org/W1983785967,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is expressed in B cells within germinal centers and is critically involved in class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin loci. Functionally active AID can additionally be detected within ectopic follicular structures developed at sites of chronic inflammation. Furthermore, AID may target non-Ig genes in B- and non-B-cell background. Therefore, AID-associated effects are of increasing interest in disease areas such as allergy, inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer. Pathway- or disease-relevant multigene signatures have attracted substantial attention for therapeutic target proposal, diagnostic tools, and monitoring of therapy response. To delineate the impact of AID in etiology of multifactorial diseases, we designed the AID-associated 25-gene signature. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps was used as an inflammation-driven airway disease model; high levels of IgE have been previously shown to be present within polyp tissue. Expression levels of 16 genes were found to be modulated in polyps including AID, IgG and IgE mature transcripts which reflect AID activity; clustering algorithm revealed an AID-specific gene signature for the disease state with nasal polyp. Complementary, AID-positive ectopic lymphoid structures were detected within polyp tissues by in situ immunostaining. Our data demonstrate the class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation events likely taking place locally in the airways and in addition to the previously highlighted markers and/or targets as IL5 and IgE suggest novel candidate genes to be considered for treatment of nasal polyposis including among others IL13 and CD23. Thus, the algorithm presented herein including the multigene signature approach, analysis of co-regularities and creation of AID-associated functional network gives an integrated view of biological processes and might be further applied to assess role of altered AID expression in etiology of other diseases, in particular, aberrant immunity and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2139674872,"Shigella flexneri is endemic in most underdeveloped countries, causing diarrheal disease and dysentery among young children. In order to reach its target site, the colon, Shigella must overcome the acid environment of the stomach. Shigella is able to persist in this stressful environment and, because of this ability it can initiate infection following the ingestion of very small inocula. Thus, acid resistance is considered an important virulence trait of this bacterium. It has been reported that moderate acid conditions regulate the expression of numerous components of the bacterial envelope. Because the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major component of the bacterial surface, here we have addressed the role of LPS in acid resistance of S. flexneri 2a. Defined deletion mutants in genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis, assembly and length regulation of the LPS O antigen were constructed and assayed for resistance to pH 2.5 after adaptation to pH 5.5. The results showed that a mutant lacking O antigen was significantly more sensitive to extreme acid conditions than the wild type. Not only the presence of polymerized O antigen, but also a particular polymer length (S-OAg) was required for acid resistance. Glucosylation of the O antigen also contributed to this property. In addition, a moderate acidic pH induced changes in the composition of the lipid A domain of LPS. The main modification was the addition of phosphoethanolamine to the 1' phosphate of lipid A. This modification increased resistance of S. flexneri to extreme acid conditions, provide that O antigen was produced. Overall, the results of this work point out to an important role of LPS in resistance of Shigella flexneri to acid stress."

Here, we study parent and offspring visual traits in threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. While focusing on the proximate basis of mating preferences, we compare the red breeding coloration of males, which strongly contributes to female choice, with their daughters' red sensitivity measured by optomotor response thresholds. We show that the red color expression of fathers correlates well with their daughters' red sensitivity. Given that a within-population genetic correlation between signal and preference was experimentally confirmed for the red coloration in sticklebacks, our results indicate a proximate mechanism in terms of perceptual sensitivity being involved in the co-evolution of female preferences and male mating signals."
https://openalex.org/W2107186707,"The incidence of breast cancer is increasing in the Western world and there is an urgent need for studies of the mechanisms of sex steroids in order to develop novel preventive strategies. Diet modifications may be among the means for breast cancer prevention. Angiogenesis, key in tumor progression, is regulated by the balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, which are controlled in the extracellular space. Sampling of these molecules at their bioactive compartment is therefore needed. The aims of this study were to explore if tamoxifen, one of the most used anti-estrogen treatments for breast cancer affected some of the most important endogenous angiogenesis regulators, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiogenin, and endostatin in normal breast tissue in vivo and if a diet supplementation with flaxseed had similar effects as tamoxifen in the breast. Microdialysis was used for in situ sampling of extracellular proteins in normal breast tissue of women before and after six weeks of tamoxifen treatment or before and after addition of 25 g/day of ground flaxseed to the diet or in control women. We show significant correlations between estradiol and levels of VEGF, angiogenin, and endostatin in vivo, which was verified in ex vivo breast tissue culture. Moreover, tamoxifen decreased the levels of VEGF and angiogenin in the breast whereas endostatin increased significantly. Flaxseed did not alter VEGF or angiogenin levels but similar to tamoxifen the levels of endostatin increased significantly. We conclude that one of the mechanisms of tamoxifen in normal breast tissue include tipping of the angiogenic balance into an anti-angiogenic state and that flaxseed has limited effects on the pro-angiogenic factors whereas the anti-angiogenic endostatin may be modified by diet. Further studies of diet modifications for breast cancer prevention are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2034241185,"The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway is involved in a diverse array of cellular processes responsible for tumorigenesis. In this case-control study, we applied a pathway-based approach to evaluate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TGF-β signaling pathway as predictors of ovarian cancer risk. We systematically genotyped 218 SNPs from 21 genes in the TGF-β signaling pathway in 417 ovarian cancer cases and 417 matched control subjects. We analyzed the associations of these SNPs with ovarian cancer risk, performed haplotype analysis and identified potential cumulative effects of genetic variants. We also performed analysis to identify higher-order gene-gene interactions influencing ovarian cancer risk. Individual SNP analysis showed that the most significant SNP was SMAD6: rs4147407, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14–2.24, P = 0.0066). Cumulative genotype analysis of 13 SNPs with significant main effects exhibited a clear dose-response trend of escalating risk with increasing number of unfavorable genotypes. In gene-based analysis, SMAD6 was identified as the most significant gene associated with ovarian cancer risk. Haplotype analysis further revealed that two haplotype blocks within SMAD6 were significantly associated with decreased ovarian cancer risk, as compared to the most common haplotype. Gene-gene interaction analysis further categorized the study population into subgroups with different ovarian cancer risk. Our findings suggest that genetic variants in the TGF-β signaling pathway are associated with ovarian cancer risk and may facilitate the identification of high-risk subgroups in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2165731072,"Background Eosinophils not only defend the body against parasitic infection but are also involved in pathological inflammatory allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and contact dermatitis. Clearance of apoptotic eosinophils by macrophages is a key process responsible for driving the resolution of eosinophilic inflammation and can be defective in allergic diseases. However, enhanced resolution of eosinophilic inflammation by deliberate induction of eosinophil apoptosis using pharmacological agents has not been previously demonstrated. Here we investigated the effect of a novel cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor drug, AT7519, on human and mouse eosinophil apoptosis and examined whether it could enhance the resolution of a murine model of eosinophil-dominant inflammation in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings Eosinophils from blood of healthy donors were treated with AT7519 and apoptosis assessed morphologically and by flow-cytometric detection of annexin-V/propidium iodide staining. AT7519 induced eosinophil apoptosis in a concentration dependent manner. Therapeutic administration of AT7519 in eosinophil-dominant allergic inflammation was investigated using an established ovalbumin-sensitised mouse model of allergic pleurisy. Following ovalbumin challenge AT7519 was administered systemically at the peak of pleural inflammation and inflammatory cell infiltrate, apoptosis and evidence of macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic eosinophils assessed at appropriate time points. Administration of AT7519 dramatically enhanced the resolution of allergic pleurisy via direct induction of eosinophil apoptosis without detriment to macrophage clearance of these cells. This enhanced resolution of inflammation was shown to be caspase-dependent as the effects of AT7519 were reduced by treatment with a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor (z-vad-fmk). Conclusions Our data show that AT7519 induces human eosinophil apoptosis and enhances the resolution of a murine model of allergic pleurisy by inducing caspase-dependent eosinophil apoptosis and enhancing macrophage ingestion of apoptotic eosinophils. These findings demonstrate the utility of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as AT7519 as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of eosinophil dominant allergic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2149599329,"The endocervical mucosa is believed to be a primary site of HIV transmission. However, to date there is little known about the distribution of the HIV co-receptor CCR5 and the HIV-binding C-type lectin receptors, including Langerin, dendritic cell (DC)-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and mannose receptor (MR) at this site. We therefore characterized the expression of these molecules in the endocervix of HIV seronegative women by computerized image analysis. Endocervical tissue biopsies were collected from women (n = 6) undergoing hysterectomy. All study individuals were diagnosed with benign and non-inflammatory diseases. CCR5+ CD4+ CD3+ T cells were found within or adjacent to the endocervical epithelium. The C-type lectin Langerin was expressed by intraepithelial CD1a+ CD4+ and CD11c+ CD4+ Langerhans cells, whereas DC-SIGN+ MR+ CD11c myeloid dendritic cells and MR+ CD68+ macrophages were localized in the submucosa of the endocervix. The previously defined immune effector cells including CD8+, CD56+, CD19+ and IgD+ cells were also found in the submucosa as well as occasional CD123+ BDCA-2+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Understanding the spatial distribution of potential HIV target cells and immune effector cells in relation to the endocervical canal forms a basis for deciphering the routes of HIV transmission events in humans as well as designing HIV-inhibiting compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2061512675,"Gibberella zeae is an important pathogen of major cereal crops. The fungus produces ascospores that forcibly discharge from mature fruiting bodies, which serve as the primary inocula for disease epidemics. In this study, we characterized an insertional mutant Z39P105 with a defect in sexual development and identified a gene encoding a putative transcription factor designated as MYT1. This gene contains a Myb DNA-binding domain and is conserved in the subphylum Pezizomycotina of Ascomycota. The MYT1 protein fused with green fluorescence protein localized in nuclei, which supports its role as a transcriptional regulator. The MYT1 deletion mutant showed similar phenotypes to the wild-type strain in vegetative growth, conidia production and germination, virulence, and mycotoxin production, but had defect in female fertility. A mutant overexpressing MYT1 showed earlier germination, faster mycelia growth, and reduced mycotoxin production compared to the wild-type strain, suggesting that improper MYT1 expression affects the expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and secondary metabolite production. This study is the first to characterize a transcription factor containing a Myb DNA-binding domain that is specific to sexual development in G. zeae."
https://openalex.org/W2040345494,"Dysregulation of TNF-α in lamina propria macrophages (LPM) is a feature of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). LPS-Induced-TNF-Alpha-Factor (LITAF) is a transcription factor that mediates TNF-α expression. To determine whether LITAF participates in the mediation of TNF-α expression in acutely inflamed colonic tissues, we first established the TNBS-induced colonic inflammation model in C57BL/6 mice. LPM were harvested from non-inflamed and inflamed colonic tissue and inflammatory parameters TNF-α and LITAF mRNA and protein levels were measured ex-vivo. LPM from TNBS-treated mice secreted significantly more TNF-α at basal state and in response to LPS than LPM from untreated mice (p<0.05). LITAF mRNA and protein levels were elevated in LPM from TNBS compared with untreated animals and LPS further increased LITAF protein levels in LPM from inflamed tissue (P<0.05). To further confirm the role of LITAF in acutely inflamed colonic tissues, TNBS-induced colonic inflammation was produced in LITAF macrophage specific knockout mice (LITAF mac -/- mice) and compared to wild type (WT) C57BL/6. Twenty four hours following TNBS administration, colonic tissue from LITAF mac -/- mice had less MPO activity and reduced colonic TNF-α mRNA then WT C57BL/6 mice (p<0.05). LPM harvested from LITAF mac -/- secreted significantly less TNF-α in response to LPS than wild type (WT) C57BL/6 (p<0.05). This study provides evidence that LITAF contributes to the regulation of TNF-α in LPM harvested following acute inflammation or LPS treatment paving the way for future work focusing on LITAF inhibitors in the treatment of TNF-α-mediated inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1976564348,"Male germ cell-associated kinase (MAK), a direct transcriptional target of androgen receptor (AR), is a co-activator of AR. In this study, we determined the activating mechanism of MAK and identified a previously unknown AR-independent role of MAK in mitosis. We found that MAK kinase activity requires dual phosphorylation of the conserved TDY motif and that the phosphorylation is dynamic during cell cycle. MAK associates with CDH1 (FZR1, fizzy/cell division cycle 20 related 1) and phosphorylates CDH1 at sites phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases. When MAK is overexpressed, the binding of CDH1 to anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome decreased, resulting in an attenuation of anaphase-promoting complex/C ubiquitin ligase activity and the consequential stabilization of the CDH1 targets such as Aurora kinase A and Polo-like kinase 1. As such, overexpression of MAK leads to mitotic defects such as centrosome amplification and lagging chromosomes. Our immunohistochemistry result showed that MAK is overexpressed in prostate tumor tissues, suggesting a role of MAK in prostate carcinogenesis. Taken with our previous results, our data implicate MAK in both AR activation and chromosomal instability, acting in both early and late prostate cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W1976774799,"The DpsA protein plays a dual role in Streptomyces coelicolor, both as part of the stress response and contributing to nucleoid condensation during sporulation. Promoter mapping experiments indicated that dpsA is transcribed from a single, sigB-like dependent promoter. Expression studies implicate SigH and SigB as the sigma factors responsible for dpsA expression while the contribution of other SigB-like factors is indirect by means of controlling sigH expression. The promoter is massively induced in response to osmotic stress, in part due to its sensitivity to changes in DNA supercoiling. In addition, we determined that WhiB is required for dpsA expression, particularly during development. Gel retardation experiments revealed direct interaction between apoWhiB and the dpsA promoter region, providing the first evidence for a direct WhiB target in S. coelicolor."
https://openalex.org/W2082454316,"The development of cortical functions and the capacity of the mature brain to learn are largely determined by the establishment and maintenance of neocortical networks. Here we address the human development of long-range connectivity in primary visual and motor cortices, using well-established behavioral measures--a Contour Integration test and a Finger-tapping task--that have been shown to be related to these specific primary areas, and the long-range neural connectivity within those. Possible confounding factors, such as different task requirements (complexity, cognitive load) are eliminated by using these tasks in a learning paradigm. We find that there is a temporal lag between the developmental timing of primary sensory vs. motor areas with an advantage of visual development; we also confirm that human development is very slow in both cases, and that there is a retained capacity for practice induced plastic changes in adults. This pattern of results seems to point to human-specific development of the ""canonical circuits"" of primary sensory and motor cortices, probably reflecting the ecological requirements of human life."
https://openalex.org/W2007837675,"Background Injury is a leading cause of the global burden of disease (GBD). Estimates of non-fatal injury burden have been limited by a paucity of empirical outcomes data. This study aimed to (i) establish the 12-month disability associated with each GBD 2010 injury health state, and (ii) compare approaches to modelling the impact of multiple injury health states on disability as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale – Extended (GOS-E). Methods 12-month functional outcomes for 11,337 survivors to hospital discharge were drawn from the Victorian State Trauma Registry and the Victorian Orthopaedic Trauma Outcomes Registry. ICD-10 diagnosis codes were mapped to the GBD 2010 injury health states. Cases with a GOS-E score >6 were defined as “recovered.” A split dataset approach was used. Cases were randomly assigned to development or test datasets. Probability of recovery for each health state was calculated using the development dataset. Three logistic regression models were evaluated: a) additive, multivariable; b) “worst injury;” and c) multiplicative. Models were adjusted for age and comorbidity and investigated for discrimination and calibration. Findings A single injury health state was recorded for 46% of cases (1–16 health states per case). The additive (C-statistic 0.70, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.71) and “worst injury” (C-statistic 0.70; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.71) models demonstrated higher discrimination than the multiplicative (C-statistic 0.68; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.70) model. The additive and “worst injury” models demonstrated acceptable calibration. Conclusions The majority of patients survived with persisting disability at 12-months, highlighting the importance of improving estimates of non-fatal injury burden. Additive and “worst” injury models performed similarly. GBD 2010 injury states were moderately predictive of recovery 1-year post-injury. Further evaluation using additional measures of health status and functioning and comparison with the GBD 2010 disability weights will be needed to optimise injury states for future GBD studies."
https://openalex.org/W2010179828,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is essential to multiple physiological and neoplastic processes via signaling by its tyrosine kinase domain and subsequent activation of transcription factors. EGFR overexpression and alteration, including point mutations and structural variants, contribute to oncogenesis in many tumor types. In this study, we identified an in-frame splice variant of the EGFR called mini-LEEK (mLEEK) that is more broadly expressed than the EGFR and is overexpressed in several cancers. Unlike previously characterized EGFR variants, mLEEK lacks the extracytoplasmic, transmembrane and tyrosine kinase domains. mLEEK localizes in the nucleus and functions as a transcription factor to regulate target genes involved in the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, including the master regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways, molecular chaperone GRP78/Bip. We demonstrated that mLEEK regulates GRP78 transcription through direct interaction with a cis-regulatory element within the gene promoter. Several UPR pathways were interrogated and mLEEK expression was found to attenuate the induction of all pathways upon ER stress. Conversely, knockdown of mLEEK resulted in caspase-mediated cell death and sensitization to ER stress. These findings indicate that mLEEK levels determine cellular responses to unfavorable conditions that cause ER stress. This information, along with the overexpression of mLEEK in tumors, suggests unique strategies for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the identification of mLEEK expands the known mechanisms by which the EGFR gene contributes to oncogenesis and represents the first link between two previously disparate areas in cancer cell biology: EGFR signaling and the UPR."
https://openalex.org/W2005811170,"Background Studies examining the association between telomere length and cancer risk have often relied on measurement of telomere length from a single blood draw using a real-time PCR technique. We examined the reliability of telomere length measurement using sequential samples collected over a 9-month period. Methods and Findings Relative telomere length in peripheral blood was estimated using a single tube monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR assay in blood DNA samples from 27 non-pregnant adult women (aged 35 to 74 years) collected in 7 visits over a 9-month period. A linear mixed model was used to estimate the components of variance for telomere length measurements attributed to variation among women and variation between time points within women. Mean telomere length measurement at any single visit was not significantly different from the average of 7 visits. Plates had a significant systematic influence on telomere length measurements, although measurements between different plates were highly correlated. After controlling for plate effects, 64% of the remaining variance was estimated to be accounted for by variance due to subject. Variance explained by time of visit within a subject was minor, contributing 5% of the remaining variance. Conclusion Our data demonstrate good short-term reliability of telomere length measurement using blood from a single draw. However, the existence of technical variability, particularly plate effects, reinforces the need for technical replicates and balancing of case and control samples across plates."
https://openalex.org/W2087510041,"Background Nitric oxide sensitive guanylyl cyclase (NOsGC) is a heterodimeric enzyme formed by an α- and a β1-subunit. A splice variant (C-α1) of the α1-subunit, lacking at least the first 236 amino acids has been described by Sharina et al. 2008 and has been shown to be expressed in differentiating human embryonic cells. Wagner et al. 2005 have shown that the amino acids 61–128 of the α1-subunit are mandatory for quantitative heterodimerization implying that the C-α1-splice variant should lose its capacity to dimerize quantitatively. Methodology/Principal Findings In the current study we demonstrate preserved quantitative dimerization of the C-α1-splice by co-purification with the β1-subunit. In addition we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based on fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) using fusion proteins of the β1-subunit and the α1-subunit or the C-α1 variant with ECFP or EYFP. Analysis of the respective combinations in HEK-293 cells showed that the fluorescence lifetime was significantly shorter (≈0.3 ns) for α1/β1 and C-α1/β1 than the negative control. In addition we show that lack of the amino-terminus in the α1 splice variant directs it to a more oxidized subcellular compartment. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that the amino-terminus of the α1-subunit is dispensable for dimerization in-vivo and ex-vivo, but influences the subcellular trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2065768752,"Bone marrow stem cells from diabetes mellitus patients exhibit functional impairment, but the relative molecular mechanisms responsible for this impairment are poorly understood. We investigated the mechanisms responsible for diabetes-related functional impairment of bone marrow stem cells by extensively screening the expression levels of inflammatory factors, cell cycle regulating molecules, extracellular matrix molecules and adhesion molecules. Bone marrow cells were collected from type 2 diabetic (db/db) and healthy control (db/m+) mice, and c-kit+ stem cells were purified (purity>85%) for experiments. Compared with the healthy control mice, diabetic mice had significantly fewer c-kit+ stem cells, and these cells had a lower potency of endothelial differentiation; however, the production of the angiogenic growth factor VEGF did not differ between groups. A pathway-focused array showed that the c-kit+ stem cells from diabetic mice had up-regulated expression levels of many inflammatory factors, including Tlr4, Cxcl9, Il9, Tgfb1, Il4, and Tnfsf5, but no obvious change in the expression levels of cell cycle molecules. Interestingly, diabetes-related alterations of the extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules were varied; Pecam, Mmp10, Lamc1, Itgb7, Mmp9, and Timp4 were up-regulated, but Col11a1, Fn1, Admts2, and Itgav were down-regulated. Some of these changes were also confirmed at the protein level by flow cytometry analysis. In conclusion, c-kit+ bone marrow stem cells from diabetic mice exhibited an extensive enhancement of inflammatory factors and disorders of the extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules. Further intervention studies are required to determine the precise role of each molecule in the diabetes-related functional impairment of c-kit+ bone marrow stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2067863598,"LMP1-mediated activation of nuclear factor of kappaB (NF-κB) is critical for the ligand independent proliferation and cell survival of in vitro EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Previous experiments revealed that a majority of LMP1-dependent responses are regulated by NF-κB. However, the extent that individual NF-κB family members are required for these responses, in particular, c-Rel, whose expression is restricted to mature hematopoietic cells, remains unclear. Here we report that low c-Rel expression in LCLs derived from a patient with hyper-IgM syndrome (Pt1), resulted in defects in proliferation and cell survival. In contrast to studies that associated loss of NF-κB with increased apoptosis, Pt1 LCLs failed to initiate apoptosis and alternatively underwent autophagy and necrotic cell death. Whereas the proliferation defect appeared linked to a c-Rel-associated decrease in c-myc expression, identified pro-survival and pro-apoptotic targets were expressed at or near control levels consistent with the absence of apoptosis. Ultrastructural examination of Pt1 LCLs revealed a high level of cellular and ER stress that was further supported by gene expression profiling showing the upregulation of several genes involved in stress and inflammation. Apoptosis-independent cell death was accompanied by increased expression of the inflammatory marker, caspase-4. Using gene overexpression and siRNA knockdown we demonstrated that levels of c-Rel directly modulated expression of caspase-4 as well as other ER stress genes. Overall, these findings reveal the importance of c-Rel in maintaining LCL viability and that decreased expression results in ER stress and a default response leading to necrotic cell death."
