https://openalex.org/W2005943573,"Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have been shown to enhance wound healing; however, the mechanisms involved are barely understood. In this study, we examined paracrine factors released by BM-MSCs and their effects on the cells participating in wound healing compared to those released by dermal fibroblasts. Analyses of BM-MSCs with Real-Time PCR and of BM-MSC-conditioned medium by antibody-based protein array and ELISA indicated that BM-MSCs secreted distinctively different cytokines and chemokines, such as greater amounts of VEGF-alpha, IGF-1, EGF, keratinocyte growth factor, angiopoietin-1, stromal derived factor-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha and beta and erythropoietin, compared to dermal fibroblasts. These molecules are known to be important in normal wound healing. BM-MSC-conditioned medium significantly enhanced migration of macrophages, keratinocytes and endothelial cells and proliferation of keratinocytes and endothelial cells compared to fibroblast-conditioned medium. Moreover, in a mouse model of excisional wound healing, where concentrated BM-MSC-conditioned medium was applied, accelerated wound healing occurred compared to administration of pre-conditioned or fibroblast-conditioned medium. Analysis of cell suspensions derived from the wound by FACS showed that wounds treated with BM-MSC-conditioned medium had increased proportions of CD4/80-positive macrophages and Flk-1-, CD34- or c-kit-positive endothelial (progenitor) cells compared to wounds treated with pre-conditioned medium or fibroblast-conditioned medium. Consistent with the above findings, immunohistochemical analysis of wound sections showed that wounds treated with BM-MSC-conditioned medium had increased abundance of macrophages. Our results suggest that factors released by BM-MSCs recruit macrophages and endothelial lineage cells into the wound thus enhancing wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2034887565,"Background Misfolding, oligomerization, and fibrillization of α-synuclein are thought to be central events in the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related disorders. Although fibrillar α-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies (LBs), recent data implicate prefibrillar, oligomeric intermediates as the toxic species. However, to date, oligomeric species have not been identified in living cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we used bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to directly visualize α-synuclein oligomerization in living cells, allowing us to study the initial events leading to α-synuclein oligomerization, the precursor to aggregate formation. This novel assay provides us with a tool with which to investigate how manipulations affecting α-synuclein aggregation affect the process over time. Stabilization of α-synuclein oligomers via BiFC results in increased cytotoxicity, which can be rescued by Hsp70 in a process that reduces the formation of α-synuclein oligomers. Introduction of PD-associated mutations in α-synuclein did not affect oligomer formation but the biochemical properties of the mutant α-synuclein oligomers differ from those of wild type α-synuclein. Conclusions/Significance This novel application of the BiFC assay to the study of the molecular basis of neurodegenerative disorders enabled the direct visualization of α-synuclein oligomeric species in living cells and its modulation by Hsp70, constituting a novel important tool in the search for therapeutics for synucleinopathies."

https://openalex.org/W2040604047,"The indoor atmosphere is an ecological unit that impacts on public health. To investigate the composition of organisms in this space, we applied culture-independent approaches to microbes harvested from the air of two densely populated urban buildings, from which we analyzed 80 megabases genomic DNA sequence and 6000 16S rDNA clones. The air microbiota is primarily bacteria, including potential opportunistic pathogens commonly isolated from human-inhabited environments such as hospitals, but none of the data contain matches to virulent pathogens or bioterror agents. Comparison of air samples with each other and nearby environments suggested that the indoor air microbes are not random transients from surrounding outdoor environments, but rather originate from indoor niches. Sequence annotation by gene function revealed specific adaptive capabilities enriched in the air environment, including genes potentially involved in resistance to desiccation and oxidative damage. This baseline index of air microbiota will be valuable for improving designs of surveillance for natural or man-made release of virulent pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2020821477,"Background SecTRAPs (selenium compromised thioredoxin reductase-derived apoptotic proteins) can be formed from the selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) by targeting of its selenocysteine (Sec) residue with electrophiles, or by its removal through C-terminal truncation. SecTRAPs are devoid of thioredoxin reductase activity but can induce rapid cell death in cultured cancer cell lines by a gain of function. Principal Findings Both human and rat SecTRAPs killed human A549 and HeLa cells. The cell death displayed both apoptotic and necrotic features. It did not require novel protein synthesis nor did it show extensive nuclear fragmentation, but it was attenuated by use of caspase inhibitors. The redox active disulfide/dithiol motif in the N-terminal domain of TrxR had to be maintained for manifestation of SecTRAP cytotoxicity. Stopped-flow kinetics showed that NADPH can reduce the FAD moiety in SecTRAPs at similar rates as in native TrxR and purified SecTRAPs could maintain NADPH oxidase activity, which was accelerated by low molecular weight substrates such as juglone. In a cellular context, SecTRAPs triggered extensive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequently antioxidants could protect against the cell killing by SecTRAPs. Conclusions We conclude that formation of SecTRAPs could contribute to the cytotoxicity seen upon exposure of cells to electrophilic agents targeting TrxR. SecTRAPs are prooxidant killers of cells, triggering mechanisms beyond those of a mere loss of thioredoxin reductase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1978742008,"We sought to determine whether clinical response or tolerance to the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram is associated with genetic polymorphisms in potentially relevant pharmacokinetic enzymes.We used a two-stage case-control study design in which we split the sample of 1,953 subjects from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial into a discovery (n = 831) and validation set (n = 1,046). Fifteen polymorphisms from five (CYP2D6, ABCB1, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5) pharmacokinetic genes were genotyped. We examined the associations between these polymorphisms and citalopram response and tolerance. Significant associations were validated in the second stage for those polymorphism found to be statistically significant in the first stage.No genetic polymorphism in the pharmacokinetic genes examined was significantly associated with our response or tolerance phenotypes in both stages. For managing pharmacological treatment with citalopram, routine screening of the common pharmacokinetic DNA variants that we examined appears to be of limited clinical utility."
https://openalex.org/W2028299297,"Background Human tumors differ from normal tissues in their capacity to present Hsp70, the major stress-inducible member of the HSP70 family, on their plasma membrane. Membrane Hsp70 has been found to serve as a prognostic indicator of overall patient survival in leukemia, lower rectal and non small cell lung carcinomas. Why tumors, but not normal cells, present Hsp70 on their cell surface and the impact of membrane Hsp70 on cancer progression remains to be elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings Although Hsp70 has been reported to be associated with cholesterol rich microdomains (CRMs), the partner in the plasma membrane with which Hsp70 interacts has yet to be identified. Herein, global lipid profiling demonstrates that Hsp70 membrane-positive tumors differ from their membrane-negative counterparts by containing significantly higher amounts of globotriaoslyceramide (Gb3), but not of other lipids such as lactosylceramide (LacCer), dodecasaccharideceramide (DoCer), galactosylceramide (GalCer), ceramide (Cer), or the ganglioside GM1. Apart from germinal center B cells, normal tissues are Gb3 membrane-negative. Co-localization of Hsp70 and Gb3 was selectively determined in Gb3 membrane-positive tumor cells, and these cells were also shown to bind soluble Hsp70-FITC protein from outside in a concentration-dependent manner. Given that the latter interaction can be blocked by a Gb3-specific antibody, and that the depletion of globotriaosides from tumors reduces the amount of membrane-bound Hsp70, we propose that Gb3 is a binding partner for Hsp70. The in vitro finding that Hsp70 predominantly binds to artificial liposomes containing Gb3 (PC/SM/Chol/Gb3, 17/45/33/5) confirms that Gb3 is an interaction partner for Hsp70. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that the presence of Gb3 enables anchorage of Hsp70 in the plasma membrane of tumors and thus they might explain tumor-specific membrane localization of Hsp70."
https://openalex.org/W2012376770,"Adult mice communicate by emitting ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during the appetitive phases of sexual behavior. However, little is known about the genes important in controlling call production. Here, we study the induction and regulation of USVs in muscarinic and dopaminergic receptor knockout (KO) mice as well as wild-type controls during sexual behavior. Female mouse urine, but not female rat or human urine, induced USVs in male mice, whereas male urine did not induce USVs in females. Direct contact of males with females is required for eliciting high level of USVs in males. USVs (25 to120 kHz) were emitted only by males, suggesting positive state; however human-audible squeaks were produced only by females, implying negative state during male-female pairing. USVs were divided into flat and frequency-modulated calls. Male USVs often changed from continuous to broken frequency-modulated calls after initiation of mounting. In M2 KO mice, USVs were lost in about 70-80% of the mice, correlating with a loss of sexual interaction. In M5 KO mice, mean USVs were reduced by almost 80% even though sexual interaction was vigorous. In D2 KOs, the duration of USVs was extended by 20%. In M4 KOs, no significant differences were observed. Amphetamine dose-dependently induced USVs in wild-type males (most at 0.5 mg/kg i.p.), but did not elicit USVs in M5 KO or female mice. These studies suggest that M2 and M5 muscarinic receptors are needed for male USV production during male-female interactions, likely via their roles in dopamine activation. These findings are important for the understanding of the neural substrates for positive affect."
https://openalex.org/W2053701895,"Background Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most frequently detected pathogens in acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) and yet little is known about the prevalence, recurrence, structure and clinical impact of individual members. During 2007, the complete coding sequences of six previously unknown and highly divergent HRV strains were reported. To catalogue the molecular and clinical features distinguishing the divergent HRV strains, we undertook, for the first time, in silico analyses of all available polyprotein sequences and performed retrospective reviews of the medical records of cases in which variants of the prototype strain, HRV-QPM, had been detected. Methodology/Principle Findings Genomic analyses revealed that the six divergent strains, residing within a clade we previously called HRV A2, had the shortest polyprotein of all picornaviruses investigated. Structure-based amino acid alignments identified conserved motifs shared among members of the genus Rhinovirus as well as substantive deletions and insertions unique to the divergent strains. Deletions mostly affected regions encoding proteins traditionally involved in antigenicity and serving as HRV and HEV receptor footprints. Because the HRV A2 strains cannot yet be cultured, we created homology models of predicted HRV-QPM structural proteins. In silico comparisons confirmed that HRV-QPM was most closely related to the major group HRVs. HRV-QPM was most frequently detected in infants with expiratory wheezing or persistent cough who had been admitted to hospital and required supplemental oxygen. It was the only virus detected in 65% of positive individuals. These observations contributed to an objective clinical impact ranging from mild to severe. Conclusions The divergent strains did not meet classification requirements for any existing species of the genus Rhinovirus or Enterovirus. HRV A2 strains should be partitioned into at least one new species, putatively called Human rhinovirus C, populated by members detected with high frequency, from individuals with respiratory symptoms requiring hospital admission."
https://openalex.org/W1984597561,"Background In the elderly persons, hemoglobin concentrations slightly below the lower limit of normal are common, but scant evidence is available on their relationship with significant health indicators. The objective of the present study was to cross-sectionally investigate the association of mild grade anemia with cognitive, functional, mood, and quality of life (QoL) variables in community-dwelling elderly persons. Methods Among the 4,068 eligible individuals aged 65–84 years, all persons with mild anemia (n = 170) and a randomly selected sample of non-anemic controls (n = 547) were included in the study. Anemia was defined according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and mild grade anemia was defined as a hemoglobin concentration between 10.0 and 11.9 g/dL in women and between 10.0 and 12.9 g/dL in men. Cognition and functional status were assessed using measures of selective attention, episodic memory, cognitive flexibility and instrumental and basic activities of daily living. Mood and QoL were evaluated by means of the Geriatric Depression Scale-10, the Short-Form health survey (SF-12), and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia. Results In univariate analyses, mild anemic elderly persons had significantly worse results on almost all cognitive, functional, mood, and QoL measures. In multivariable logistic regressions, after adjustment for a large number of demographic and clinical confounders, mild anemia remained significantly associated with measures of selective attention and disease-specific QoL (all fully adjusted p<.046). When the lower limit of normal hemoglobin concentration according to WHO criteria was raised to define anemia (+0.2 g/dL), differences between mild anemic and non anemic elderly persons tended to increase on almost every variable. Conclusions Cross-sectionally, mild grade anemia was independently associated with worse selective attention performance and disease-specific QoL ratings."
https://openalex.org/W2035248355,"Previous studies documented significant behavioral changes in the offspring of cocaine-exposed mothers. We now explore the hypothesis that maternal cocaine exposure could alter the fetal epigenetic machinery sufficiently to cause lasting neurochemical and functional changes in the offspring. Pregnant CD1 mice were administered either saline or 20 mg/kg cocaine twice daily on gestational days 8-19. Male pups from each of ten litters of the cocaine and control groups were analyzed at 3 (P3) or 30 (P30) days postnatum. Global DNA methylation, methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by CGI(2) microarray profiling and bisulfite sequencing, as well as quantitative real-time RT-PCR gene expression analysis, were evaluated in hippocampal pyramidal neurons excised by laser capture microdissection. Following maternal cocaine exposure, global DNA methylation was significantly decreased at P3 and increased at P30. Among the 492 CGIs whose methylation was significantly altered by cocaine at P3, 34% were hypermethylated while 66% were hypomethylated. Several of these CGIs contained promoter regions for genes implicated in crucial cellular functions. Endogenous expression of selected genes linked to the abnormally methylated CGIs was correspondingly decreased or increased by as much as 4-19-fold. By P30, some of the cocaine-associated effects at P3 endured, reversed to opposite directions, or disappeared. Further, additional sets of abnormally methylated targets emerged at P30 that were not observed at P3. Taken together, these observations indicate that maternal cocaine exposure during the second and third trimesters of gestation could produce potentially profound structural and functional modifications in the epigenomic programs of neonatal and prepubertal mice."
https://openalex.org/W2070542788,"Recently, heightened systemic translocation of microbial products was found in persons with chronic HIV infection and this was linked to immune activation and CD4(+) T cell homeostasis.We examined here the effects of microbial Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands on T cell activation in vitro.We show that exposure to TLR ligands results in activation of memory and effector CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. After exposure to each of 8 different ligands that activate TLRs 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, CD8(+) T cells are activated and gain expression of the C type lectin CD69 that may promote their retention in lymphoid tissues. In contrast, CD4(+) T cells rarely increase CD69 expression but instead enter cell cycle. Despite activation and cell cycle entry, CD4(+) T cells divide poorly and instead, disproportionately undergo activation-induced cell death. Systemic exposure to TLR agonists may therefore increase immune activation, effector cell sequestration in lymphoid tissues and T cell turnover. These events may contribute to the pathogenesis of immune dysfunction and CD4+ T cell losses in chronic infection with the human immunodeficiency virus."
https://openalex.org/W1985793667,"Background Many inducible plant-defense responses are activated by jasmonates (JAs), C6-aldehydes, and their corresponding derivatives, produced by the two main competing branches of the oxylipin pathway, the allene oxide synthase (AOS) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) branches, respectively. In addition to competition for substrates, these branch-pathway-derived metabolites have substantial overlap in regulation of gene expression. Past experiments to define the role of C6-aldehydes in plant defense responses were biased towards the exogenous application of the synthetic metabolites or the use of genetic manipulation of HPL expression levels in plant genotypes with intact ability to produce the competing AOS-derived metabolites. To uncouple the roles of the C6-aldehydes and jasmonates in mediating direct and indirect plant-defense responses, we generated Arabidopsis genotypes lacking either one or both of these metabolites. These genotypes were subsequently challenged with a phloem-feeding insect (aphids: Myzus persicae), an insect herbivore (leafminers: Liriomyza trifolii), and two different necrotrophic fungal pathogens (Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria brassicicola). We also characterized the volatiles emitted by these plants upon aphid infestation or mechanical wounding and identified hexenyl acetate as the predominant compound in these volatile blends. Subsequently, we examined the signaling role of this compound in attracting the parasitoid wasp (Aphidius colemani), a natural enemy of aphids. Principal Findings This study conclusively establishes that jasmonates and C6-aldehydes play distinct roles in plant defense responses. The jasmonates are indispensable metabolites in mediating the activation of direct plant-defense responses, whereas the C6-aldehyes are not. On the other hand, hexenyl acetate, an acetylated C6-aldehyde, is the predominant wound-inducible volatile signal that mediates indirect defense responses by directing tritrophic (plant-herbivore-natural enemy) interactions. Significance The data suggest that jasmonates and hexenyl acetate play distinct roles in mediating direct and indirect plant-defense responses. The potential advantage of this “division of labor” is to ensure the most effective defense strategy that minimizes incurred damages at a reduced metabolic cost."
https://openalex.org/W1981690123,"Functional gene analysis in vivo represents still a major challenge in biomedical research. Here we present a new method for the efficient introduction of nucleic acids into the postnatal mouse forebrain. We show that intraventricular injection of DNA followed by electroporation induces strong expression of transgenes in radial glia, neuronal precursors and neurons of the olfactory system. We present two proof-of-principle experiments to validate our approach. First, we show that expression of a human isoform of the neural cell adhesion molecule (hNCAM-140) in radial glia cells induces their differentiation into cells showing a neural precursor phenotype. Second, we demonstrate that p21 acts as a cell cycle inhibitor for postnatal neural stem cells. This approach will represent an important tool for future studies of postnatal neurogenesis and of neural development in general."
https://openalex.org/W1977424552,"Background We study the evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma on two social networks substrates obtained from actual relational data. Methodology/Principal Findings We find very different cooperation levels on each of them that cannot be easily understood in terms of global statistical properties of both networks. We claim that the result can be understood at the mesoscopic scale, by studying the community structure of the networks. We explain the dependence of the cooperation level on the temptation parameter in terms of the internal structure of the communities and their interconnections. We then test our results on community-structured, specifically designed artificial networks, finding a good agreement with the observations in both real substrates. Conclusion Our results support the conclusion that studies of evolutionary games on model networks and their interpretation in terms of global properties may not be sufficient to study specific, real social systems. Further, the study allows us to define new quantitative parameters that summarize the mesoscopic structure of any network. In addition, the community perspective may be helpful to interpret the origin and behavior of existing networks as well as to design structures that show resilient cooperative behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1967946955,"Two to three percent of the world's population is chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and thus at risk of developing liver cancer. Although precise mechanisms regulating HCV entry into hepatic cells are still unknown, several cell surface proteins have been identified as entry factors for this virus. Among these molecules, the tetraspanin CD81 is essential for HCV entry. Here, we have identified a partner of CD81, EWI-2wint, which is expressed in several cell lines but not in hepatocytes. Ectopic expression of EWI-2wint in a hepatoma cell line susceptible to HCV infection blocked viral entry by inhibiting the interaction between the HCV envelope glycoproteins and CD81. This finding suggests that, in addition to the presence of specific entry factors in the hepatocytes, the lack of a specific inhibitor can contribute to the hepatotropism of HCV. This is the first example of a pathogen gaining entry into host cells that lack a specific inhibitory factor."
https://openalex.org/W2053837997,"Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous disease. In order to understand the partial responsiveness to IFNß in Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS) we studied the pharmacological effects of IFNß therapy. Methodology Large scale gene expression profiling was performed on peripheral blood of 16 RRMS patients at baseline and one month after the start of IFNß therapy. Differential gene expression was analyzed by Significance Analysis of Microarrays. Subsequent expression analyses on specific genes were performed after three and six months of treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and stimulated in vitro with IFNß. Genes of interest were measured and validated by quantitative realtime PCR. An independent group of 30 RRMS patients was used for validation. Principal Findings Pharmacogenomics revealed a marked variation in the pharmacological response to IFNß between patients. A total of 126 genes were upregulated in a subset of patients whereas in other patients these genes were downregulated or unchanged after one month of IFNß therapy. Most interestingly, we observed that the extent of the pharmacological response correlates negatively with the baseline expression of a specific set of 15 IFN response genes (R = −0.7208; p = 0.0016). The negative correlation was maintained after three (R = −0.7363; p = 0.0027) and six (R = −0.8154; p = 0.0004) months of treatment, as determined by gene expression levels of the most significant correlating gene. Similar results were obtained in an independent group of patients (n = 30; R = −0.4719; p = 0.0085). Moreover, the ex vivo results could be confirmed by in vitro stimulation of purified PBMCs at baseline with IFNß indicating that differential responsiveness to IFNß is an intrinsic feature of peripheral blood cells at baseline. Conclusion These data imply that the expression levels of IFN response genes in the peripheral blood of MS patients prior to treatment could serve a role as biomarker for the differential clinical response to IFNß."
https://openalex.org/W2069582829,"Local and volatile anesthetics are widely used for surgery. It is not known whether anesthetics impinge on the orchestrated events in spontaneous resolution of acute inflammation. Here we investigated whether a commonly used local anesthetic (lidocaine) and a widely used inhaled anesthetic (isoflurane) impact the active process of resolution of inflammation.Using murine peritonitis induced by zymosan and a systems approach, we report that lidocaine delayed and blocked key events in resolution of inflammation. Lidocaine inhibited both PMN apoptosis and macrophage uptake of apoptotic PMN, events that contributed to impaired PMN removal from exudates and thereby delayed the onset of resolution of acute inflammation and return to homeostasis. Lidocaine did not alter the levels of specific lipid mediators, including pro-inflammatory leukotriene B(4), prostaglandin E(2) and anti-inflammatory lipoxin A(4), in the cell-free peritoneal lavages. Addition of a lipoxin A(4) stable analog, partially rescued lidocaine-delayed resolution of inflammation. To identify protein components underlying lidocaine's actions in resolution, systematic proteomics was carried out using nanospray-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Lidocaine selectively up-regulated pro-inflammatory proteins including S100A8/9 and CRAMP/LL-37, and down-regulated anti-inflammatory and some pro-resolution peptides and proteins including IL-4, IL-13, TGF-â and Galectin-1. In contrast, the volatile anesthetic isoflurane promoted resolution in this system, diminishing the amplitude of PMN infiltration and shortening the resolution interval (Ri) approximately 50%. In addition, isoflurane down-regulated a panel of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, as well as proteins known to be active in cell migration and chemotaxis (i.e., CRAMP and cofilin-1). The distinct impact of lidocaine and isoflurane on selective molecules may underlie their opposite actions in resolution of inflammation, namely lidocaine delayed the onset of resolution (T(max)), while isoflurane shortened resolution interval (Ri).Taken together, both local and volatile anesthetics impact endogenous resolution program(s), altering specific resolution indices and selective cellular/molecular components in inflammation-resolution. Isoflurane enhances whereas lidocaine impairs timely resolution of acute inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1996648968,"Background Radioactive iodine is commonly administered following thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma to ablate the thyroid remnant. The optimal administered activity of radioiodine is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Adult subjects (n = 160) diagnosed with papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma were randomly allocated to receive either 1100 MBq (30 mCi) or 3700 MBq (100 mCi) activity of radioiodine (131I) following thyroidectomy. The study participants were prepared for ablation using thyroid hormone withdrawal. Ablation was considered successful when serum thyroglobulin concentration was less than 1 ng/mL and no uptake was present in 131I scan. Ablation was successful following one administration of radioiodine in 42 (52%; 95% CI, 41% to 63%) of the 81 evaluable study participants who received 1100 MBq, and in 43 (56%, 45% to 67%) of the 77 subjects who received 3700 MBq activity (P = .61). There was no difference between the groups in the numbers of repeat radioiodine treatments needed to complete ablation (P = .27). The higher activity was associated with more nausea and taste disturbances, and a longer stay in a radioprotected isolation unit. None of the participants died from thyroid cancer during a median follow up of 51 months; three subjects in the 3700 MBq group and none in the 1100 MBq group were diagnosed with distant metastases during follow-up. In a meta-analysis of four randomized studies that compared the 1100 and 3700 MBq activities, the 1100 MBq activity tended to be associated with a higher risk of unsuccessful ablation (relative risk 1.148, 95% CI 0.974 to 1.353, P = .10). Conclusions/Significance The results provide no conclusive evidence that 3700 MBq activity is more effective for ablation of the thyroid remnant than 1100 MBq activity. The 3700 MBq activity is associated with more adverse effects. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00115895"
https://openalex.org/W2025646713,"Activin, a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, is an endocrine hormone that regulates differentiation and proliferation of a wide variety of cells. In the brain, activin protects neurons from ischemic damage. In this study, we demonstrate that activin modulates anxiety-related behavior by analyzing ACM4 and FSM transgenic mice in which activin and follistatin (which antagonizes the activin signal), respectively, were overexpressed in a forebrain-specific manner under the control of the αCaMKII promoter. Behavioral analyses revealed that FSM mice exhibited enhanced anxiety compared to wild-type littermates, while ACM4 mice showed reduced anxiety. Importantly, survival of newly formed neurons in the subgranular zone of adult hippocampus was significantly decreased in FSM mice, which was partially rescued in ACM4/FSM double transgenic mice. Our findings demonstrate that the level of activin in the adult brain bi-directionally influences anxiety-related behavior. These results further suggest that decreases in postnatal neurogenesis caused by activin inhibition affect an anxiety-related behavior in adulthood. Activin and its signaling pathway may represent novel therapeutic targets for anxiety disorder as well as ischemic brain injury."
https://openalex.org/W2005272949,"Previous work has demonstrated the potential for peripheral blood (PB) gene expression profiling for the detection of disease or environmental exposures.We have sought to determine the impact of several variables on the PB gene expression profile of an environmental exposure, ionizing radiation, and to determine the specificity of the PB signature of radiation versus other genotoxic stresses. Neither genotype differences nor the time of PB sampling caused any lessening of the accuracy of PB signatures to predict radiation exposure, but sex difference did influence the accuracy of the prediction of radiation exposure at the lowest level (50 cGy). A PB signature of sepsis was also generated and both the PB signature of radiation and the PB signature of sepsis were found to be 100% specific at distinguishing irradiated from septic animals. We also identified human PB signatures of radiation exposure and chemotherapy treatment which distinguished irradiated patients and chemotherapy-treated individuals within a heterogeneous population with accuracies of 90% and 81%, respectively.We conclude that PB gene expression profiles can be identified in mice and humans that are accurate in predicting medical conditions, are specific to each condition and remain highly accurate over time."
https://openalex.org/W2023870183,"The degree of phenotypic divergence and reproductive isolation between taxon pairs can vary quantitatively, and often increases as evolutionary divergence proceeds through various stages, from polymorphism to population differentiation, ecotype and race formation, speciation, and post-speciational divergence. Although divergent natural selection promotes divergence, it does not always result in strong differentiation. For example, divergent selection can fail to complete speciation, and distinct species pairs sometimes collapse ('speciation in reverse'). Widely-discussed explanations for this variability concern genetic architecture, and the geographic arrangement of populations. A less-explored possibility is that the degree of phenotypic and reproductive divergence between taxon pairs is positively related to the number of ecological niche dimensions (i.e., traits) subject to divergent selection. Some data supporting this idea stem from laboratory experimental evolution studies using Drosophila, but tests from nature are lacking. Here we report results from manipulative field experiments in natural populations of herbivorous Timema stick insects that are consistent with this 'niche dimensionality' hypothesis. In such insects, divergent selection between host plants might occur for cryptic colouration (camouflage to evade visual predation), physiology (to detoxify plant chemicals), or both of these niche dimensions. We show that divergent selection on the single niche dimension of cryptic colouration can result in ecotype formation and intermediate levels of phenotypic and reproductive divergence between populations feeding on different hosts. However, greater divergence between a species pair involved divergent selection on both niche dimensions. Although further replication of the trends reported here is required, the results suggest that dimensionality of selection may complement genetic and geographic explanations for the degree of diversification in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1967631017,"ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1 is required for the lipidation of apolipoprotein A-I to generate high density lipoprotein (HDL). This process is proposed to occur through a retro-endocytosis pathway in which apoA-I internalizes with ABCA1 and generates HDL from the endosomal compartments before resecretion. The aim of this study was to determine the route of apoA-I endocytosis and whether endocytosis contributes to HDL biogenesis. Using confocal microscopy, we found that internalized apoA-I only transiently colocalized with transferrin, a retro-endocytosis marker. Instead, apoA-I perfectly colocalized with a bulk phase uptake marker (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran) and, at later time points, with LysoTracker in several cell models including macrophages, fibroblasts, and baby hamster kidney cells. ABCA1 colocalized poorly with internalized apoA-I. To determine the contribution of internalized apoA-I to HDL biogenesis, we specifically removed apoA-I from the cell surface and analyzed the fate of internalized apoA-I. We found that 23% of cell-associated apoA-I was internalized at steady state. Of internalized apoA-I, only 20% was converted to HDL, and the rest was degraded, consistent with a lysosomal destination. We also found that apoA-I was released approximately five times faster from the plasma membrane than from the intracellular compartments. From these kinetic parameters, we estimated that ∼5.6% of apoA-I that interacts with cells is degraded and that internalized apoA-I contributes to ∼1.4% of total HDL production. We also found that blocking endocytosis with sucrose or cytochalasin D did not decrease cholesterol efflux or HDL biogenesis. We therefore conclude that the plasma membrane is the main platform where ABCA1-mediated lipidation of apoA-I occurs. ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1 is required for the lipidation of apolipoprotein A-I to generate high density lipoprotein (HDL). This process is proposed to occur through a retro-endocytosis pathway in which apoA-I internalizes with ABCA1 and generates HDL from the endosomal compartments before resecretion. The aim of this study was to determine the route of apoA-I endocytosis and whether endocytosis contributes to HDL biogenesis. Using confocal microscopy, we found that internalized apoA-I only transiently colocalized with transferrin, a retro-endocytosis marker. Instead, apoA-I perfectly colocalized with a bulk phase uptake marker (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran) and, at later time points, with LysoTracker in several cell models including macrophages, fibroblasts, and baby hamster kidney cells. ABCA1 colocalized poorly with internalized apoA-I. To determine the contribution of internalized apoA-I to HDL biogenesis, we specifically removed apoA-I from the cell surface and analyzed the fate of internalized apoA-I. We found that 23% of cell-associated apoA-I was internalized at steady state. Of internalized apoA-I, only 20% was converted to HDL, and the rest was degraded, consistent with a lysosomal destination. We also found that apoA-I was released approximately five times faster from the plasma membrane than from the intracellular compartments. From these kinetic parameters, we estimated that ∼5.6% of apoA-I that interacts with cells is degraded and that internalized apoA-I contributes to ∼1.4% of total HDL production. We also found that blocking endocytosis with sucrose or cytochalasin D did not decrease cholesterol efflux or HDL biogenesis. We therefore conclude that the plasma membrane is the main platform where ABCA1-mediated lipidation of apoA-I occurs. Identification of the genetic defect causing Tangier disease has revealed that the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) 4The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette transporter; apo, apolipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BHK, baby hamster kidney; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Tf, transferrin. 4The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette transporter; apo, apolipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BHK, baby hamster kidney; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Tf, transferrin. plays a key role in the biogenesis of HDL (1Bodzioch M.

Mutated ABCA1 transporters fail to mediate lipid efflux to extracellular receptors, such as apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). This results in the hypercatabolism of apoA-I and a dramatic reduction of plasma HDL levels (5Batal R. Tremblay M. Krimbou L. Mamer O. Davignon J. Genest Jr., J. Cohn J.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

The molecular mechanisms by which ABCA1 mediates cholesterol efflux to apoA-I remains elusive. It is hypothesized that ABCA1 may interact with apoA-I and directly transfer lipids onto apoA-I (7Fitzgerald M.L. Morris A.L. Rhee J.S. Andersson L.P. Mendez A.J. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33178-33187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8Nofer J.R. Remaley A.T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 2150-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ABCA1 may also facilitate the insertion of lipid-poor apoA-I into the non-raft domains at the plasma membrane, where apoA-I acquires lipids before being released as nascent HDL particles (9Landry Y.D. Denis M. Nandi S. Bell S. Vaughan A.M. Zha X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36091-36101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Alternatively, apoA-I has been shown to internalize to the endosomes. It is hypothesized and widely accepted that internalized apoA-I might acquire lipids and be resecreted to the medium as HDL, following the retro-endocytosis pathway (10Neufeld E.B. Stonik J.A. Demosky Jr., S.J. Knapper C.L. Combs C.A. Cooney A. Comly M. Dwyer N. Blanchette-Mackie J. Remaley A.T. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The contribution of this retro-endocytosis pathway to the formation of nascent HDL particles, relative to the events occurring at the plasma membrane, remains to be determined. The retro-endocytosis hypothesis is attractive because the endosomes are the second most important reservoir of cellular cholesterol after the plasma membrane (12Mukherjee S. Zha X. Tabas I. Maxfield F.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1915-1925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). By keeping apoA-I transiently in the endosomes, perhaps increasing its local concentration, this pathway may facilitate the transfer of cholesterol to apoA-I. To date, the detailed route by which apoA-I endocytose or exocytose is not known. Endocytosis of plasma membrane-bound proteins has been extensively described (13Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). Briefly, receptor-mediated endocytosis refers to a highly efficient process (t½ = 1-5 min) where adaptors interact with the cytoplasmic tail of cargo proteins and recruit them into clathrin-coated pits (13Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). Low density lipoprotein and transferrin endocytosis are examples of this process. Endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits represents a highly efficient process such that two-thirds of cargo proteins, i.e. transferrin receptors, are found in the endosomes at steady state (14Jing S.Q. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Another form of endocytosis, bulk phase uptake, refers to a collection of clathrin-independent mechanisms that contribute to the recycling of the plasma membrane (15Mayor S. Pagano R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Bulk phase uptake is also known to internalize plasma membrane bound proteins although at 5-10% of the rate of receptor-mediated endocytosis (16Pagano R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 652-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The endosomes generated by those respective routes then merge to form the sorting endosomes. From there, most of the membrane and membrane-bound proteins are recycled back to the plasma membrane, whereas the lumen content is delivered to the lysosomes for degradation (13Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). apoA-I may endocytose by clathrin-coated pits through its interaction with transmembrane proteins such as ABCA1. The majority of cell-associated apoA-I would then be found in endosomes. This would point toward the endosomal pathway as a major site for apoA-I lipidation. Alternatively, apoA-I could insert into the plasma membrane first and internalize together with slow bulk phase uptake. In that case, the cell-associated apoA-I should be mainly surface-bound, thus implicating the plasma membrane as the dominant location for apoA-I lipidation. We therefore sought to characterize the endocytic route of apoA-I in detail and determine the relative contribution of internalized apoA-I to the biogenesis of nascent HDL particles. Cell Culture—All of the cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells stably transfected with noncoding (mock) or an ABCA1-encoding vector were from Dr. Oram (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). ABCA1 expression is under the control of a mifepristone-inducible promoter as previously described (17Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Primary human skin fibroblasts of normal and Tangier disease patients (Q597R) were provided by Dr. Genest (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). RAW264.7 mouse macrophages were purchased from ATCC. For induction of ABCA1 expression, the cells were incubated for 20 h with either 10 nm mifepristone (BHK cells), 2.5 μg/ml 22 (R)-hydroxycholesterol, and 10 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid (human skin fibroblasts), or 0.5 mm 8-bromo-cAMP (RAW264.7 macrophages). Preparation of Fluorescent and Radioactive apoA-I—500 μg of human purified apolipoprotein A-I obtained from Biodesign (Saco, ME) was conjugated to Cy3.5 following the manufacturer's protocol or with 2 mCi 125I (GE-Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of Iodogen® beads (Pierce), purified using a Sephadex G25 column, and extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Confocal Microscopy—The cells cultured in 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes were incubated with Cy3.5-apoA-I (5 μg/ml) in DMEM alone or plus either AlexaFluor488-Tf (10 μg/ml), FITC-dextran (5 mg/ml) or LysoTracker (0.1 μm) for the indicated times before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Confocal microscopy images were taken using a C1 confocal module on a Nikon TE2000-E inverted fluorescent microscope with a 60× objective and laser lines at 488 and 594 nm. Images from ABCA1 and mock cells were taken under identical conditions. Colocalization was evaluated by counting overlapping intracellular vesicles (250-800 dots/time point) in both channels. Stripping of Surface-bound apoA-I—The cells were pulse-labeled with either 5 μg/ml Cy3.5-apoA-I or 125I-apoA-I for the indicated times. Following medium removal and wash, the cells were incubated with sucrose (250 mm) in DMEM containing 25 μg/ml unlabeled apoA-I twice for 5 min at 37 °C. This was followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline before incubation with chase medium for the indicated times. The cells were then either fixed for microscopy or lysed in 0.5 n NaOH prior to γ-counting. Lower temperatures (15 or 4 °C) did not allow significant cell surface stripping (data not shown). Cholesterol Efflux—BHK cells were labeled with 2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 24 h, induced with 10 nm mifepristone, and incubated with 5 μg/ml apoA-I or Cy3.5-apoA-I. At the end of the efflux period, the medium was collected, and the cells were lysed in 0.5 n NaOH. Radioactivity in the medium and cells was determined by scintillation counting, and the efflux was calculated as the percentage of CPMmed/(CPMmed + CPMcell). 125I-apoA-I Cell Association—For dose-response experiments, induced BHK cells were incubated for 2 h with the indicated doses of 125I-apoA-I in DMEM. For time course experiments, the cells were incubated for the indicated times with 5 μg/ml 125I-apoA-I. The nonspecific association was determined by identical procedure with the labeling medium containing 200 μg/ml of unlabeled apoA-I. At the end of the incubation, the cells were lysed with 0.5 n NaOH and counted to determine whole cell association. Alternatively, to determine intracellular cell association, surface-bound 125I-apoA-I was stripped prior to γ-counting. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method, and specific association was determined by subtracting nonspecific counts from total counts for each point. The plasma membrane association was calculated by subtracting the specific intracellular association from the specific whole cell association. Kinetic parameters (Kd, Bmax, Kon, Koff, t½) were determined using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software. Precipitation with Trichloroacetic Acid on the Chase Medium—Intact protein precipitation was performed for 1 h on ice in chase medium by adding ice-cold sodium deoxycholate (final concentration, 0.15%) followed by ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 10%) before centrifugation at 13,000 × g. The supernatants (degraded) and pellets (intact protein) were counted. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis of Nascent HDL Particles—The media were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra; molecular weight cut-off, 10,000; Millipore). The samples (300 μl) were loaded on a 1.5-mm-thick 0.75% agarose gel prepared in Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.3, using 10% polyacrylamide to seal the bottom of the gel as described previously (18Duong P.T. Collins H.L. Nickel M. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 832-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The second dimension, a 4-22.5% polyacrylamide nondenaturing concave gradient gel, was run at 4 °C for 24 h at 10 mA/gel, as previously described (19Krimbou L. Hajj H.H. Blain S. Rashid S. Denis M. Marcil M. Genest J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1668-1677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). After transfer (30 mA, 24 h, 4 °C) onto nitrocellulose membranes, molecular weight markers were revealed by Ponceau S. The membranes were either directly revealed by autoradiography or processed for immunoblotting. Endocytosis of apoA-I in ABCA1-expressing cells has been previously reported (11Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 20Neufeld E.B. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Stonik J.A. Cooney A.M. Comly M. Dwyer N.K. Zhang M. Blanchette-Mackie J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27584-27590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), but the specific route has yet to be clarified. To do so, we fluorescently (Cy3.5) labeled apoA-I and tested whether Cy3.5-apoA-I is a valid analog of native apoA-I. We found that Cy3.5 apoA-I behaves identically to native apoA-I in terms of the specificity of cell association (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), the ability to promote cholesterol efflux (supplemental Fig. S1D), and the capacity to generate nascent HDL particles (supplemental Fig. S1C) in BHK cells expressing ABCA1. Similar results were obtained using primary human skin fibroblasts from control and Tangier subjects (data not shown). We then used Cy3.5-apoA-I to track apoA-I endocytosis over time by confocal microscopy. Cy3.5-apoA-I bound to the plasma membrane first (Fig. 1A, 2 min) and then gradually appeared in the intracellular organelles (Fig. 1B, 30 min). z sections that covered the entire cell volume revealed that the majority of cell-associated Cy3.5-apoA-I was localized to the plasma membrane at 60 min, whereas a small fraction was internalized in punctated structures (Fig. 1C). This is in agreement with previous observations obtained by cell surface biotinylation in a different cell model (21Hassan H.H. Denis M. Lee D.Y. Iatan I. Nyholt D. Ruel I. Krimbou L. Genest J. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2428-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We also examined whether apoA-I was internalized with ABCA1. The cells were pulsed with Cy3.5-apoA-I for 5 min and chased for up to 2 h before immunofluorescent detection of ABCA1. We found little colocalization (<10%) between Cy3.5-apoA-I and ABCA1 throughout the chase, consistent with recent reports showing that the majority (∼90%) of cell-associated apoA-I is not bound to ABCA1 (22Vedhachalam C. Ghering A.B. Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Representative images are shown in Fig. 1 (D-F). We next investigated the route of apoA-I endocytosis. We postulated that, if apoA-I is internalized through the clathrin-coated pits and is recycled back to the extracellular medium, it should colocalize at all times with transferrin (Tf), a well established marker for this pathway. The cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min with Cy3.5-apoA-I (5 μg/ml) and chased in apoA-I-free medium for up to 2 h. The recycling pathway was tracked by Alexa488-Tf. At the end of the chase, the cells were fixed and analyzed by confocal microscopy. At early time points, most of the apoA-I was found in Tf-containing compartments (Fig. 2A, upper panels, 15 min), indicating the passage of apoA-I through the endosomal system. At later time points, however, the colocalization observed between Tf and apoA-I was much less (Fig. 2A, upper panels, 120 min), suggesting the departure of apoA-I from the recycling pathway. This observation was further confirmed when we scored a large number of Cy3.5-apoA-I-positive organelles (>500 organelles/time point) for the presence of Alexa488-Tf in the same compartment. Although most of the Cy3.5-apoA-I-positive compartments contained Tf (∼100%) at t ≤ 1 h, the number gradually decreased to less than 40% at later time points, indicating that apoA-I was diverted from the recycling pathway (Fig. 2A, lower panel). It is worth noting that, even though Tf was present in all apoA-I-positive compartments at the early time points, a large number of Tf-positive compartments did not have apoA-I (Fig. 2A, upper panels, 15 min). This further suggests that apoA-I only shared a part of the recycling pathway with Tf. To test whether apoA-I is internalized by bulk phase uptake, we coincubated Cy3.5-apoA-I with FITC-dextran, a bulk phase marker, for up to 2 h and examined their localizations by confocal microscopy. We found that there was perfect colocalization between internalized Cy3.5-apoA-I and FITC-dextran at all time points (Fig. 2B, upper panels). Quantitatively, nearly all Cy3.5-apoA-I-positive compartments contained FITC-dextran (Fig. 2B, lower panel). In contrast to Tf, all FITC-dextran-positive compartments were also positive with Cy3.5-apoA-I (Fig. 2B, upper panels). This strongly indicates that apoA-I was internalized through bulk phase uptake, most likely by being bound to the plasma membrane. Bulk phase uptake can also internalize apoA-I from the medium, but this process was negligible because ABCA1-/- cells do not take up a measurable amount of apoA-I (Fig. 1F) despite enhanced endocytosis in these cells (23Zha X. Genest Jr., J. McPherson R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39476-39483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because FITC-dextran is known to reach lysosomes at later time points, this raised the possibility that internalized apoA-I may be targeted to lysosomes. We therefore prelabeled the lysosomes with LysoTracker-Green. The cells were then pulse-labeled with Cy3.5-apoA-I for 5 min and chased in Cy3.5-apoA-I free medium for up to 6 h. There was little colocalization between apoA-I and LysoTracker at early time points, as expected (Fig. 2C, 15 min). However, by 2 h, the majority of Cy3.5-apoA-I was seen to colocalize with LysoTracker (Fig. 2C, 2 h), suggesting that apoA-I had reached the lysosome. Scoring a large number of Cy3.5-apoA-I-positive compartments for the presence of LysoTracker indicted a gradual appearance of apoA-I in the LysoTracker-positive compartments (Fig. 2C, lower panel), consistent with apoA-I being delivered to the lysosomes. Cy3.5 fluorescent modification of apoA-I could potentially trigger its lysosomal targeting. To explore this possibility, we incubated cells with unlabeled apoA-I along with LysoTracker Red for 1 h. apoA-I was detected by immunofluorescent staining. Native apoA-I decorated the plasma membrane as well as intracellular compartments, similar to Cy3.5-apoA-I. Importantly, these intracellular compartments colocalized extensively with Lysotracker (supplemental Fig. S2A). Fluorescent modification therefore could not be the cause of apoA-I targeting to lysosomes. We then investigated whether internalized apoA-I was targeted to the lysosome in other cell types that express endogenous ABCA1. We found that in a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7), Cy3.5-apoA-I almost perfectly colocalized with LysoTracker (supplemental Fig. S2B). Similar results were obtained in normal human skin fibroblasts, RAW macrophages, and HepG2 hepatocytes (supplemental Fig. S2C). In contrast, mock transfected cells, uninduced RAW, and human skin fibroblasts, as well as skin fibroblasts from a Tangier patient, failed to bind and internalize Cy3.5-apoA-I. This suggests that lysosomal targeting of internalized apoA-I is a general phenomenon operating in ABCA1-expressing cell models. Lysosomes are best known for their role in degradation, although apoA-I is not known to be significantly degraded in most cell types. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that lysosomes may also fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents to the extracellular medium (24Luzio J.P. Pryor P.R. Bright N.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 622-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). In addition, apoA-I was reported to shuttle from late endosomes back to the cell surface (10Neufeld E.B. Stonik J.A. Demosky Jr., S.J. Knapper C.L. Combs C.A. Cooney A. Comly M. Dwyer N. Blanchette-Mackie J. Remaley A.T. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15571-15578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to quantitatively examine the fate of internalized apoA-I and, in particular, to determine the relative contribution of apoA-I internalization to the overall biogenesis of HDL. To do so, we needed to develop a method to specifically quantify the amount of apoA-I associated with the intracellular compartments by removing apoA-I from the cell surface. Acid washing, a classic method to strip off cell surface-bound ligands including Tf, was found without effect on cell surface-bound Cy3.5-apoA-I (not shown). In a second approach, we successfully stripped off cell surface Cy3.5-apoA-I with excess unlabeled apoA-I in the presence of sucrose. Sucrose was necessary to prevent all types of endocytosis during 5 min of stripping (supplemental Fig. S3). Cell surface Cy3.5-apoA-I could only be efficiently replaced by unlabeled apoA-I at 37 °C. By confocal microscopy, we observed a complete removal of surface-bound Cy3.5-apoA-I without affecting the intracellular pool (Fig. 3A). High stripping efficiency was further confirmed with 125I-apoA-I. In cells pulse-labeled with 125I-apoA-I for 2 min, a condition where apoA-I was mostly seen on the plasma membrane with relatively minor endocytosis (Fig. 1A), the stripping protocol removed more than 80% of cell-associated 125I-apoA-I (Fig. 3B). The residual radioactivity was partially due to a minor degree of endocytosis during 2 min of pulse. We therefore applied this protocol to a dose-response experiment to quantify the specific 125I-apoA-I association with the different cellular pools: whole cells (no stripping), intracellular compartments (after stripping), and plasma membrane (whole cells minus intracellular compartments) (Fig. 3C). We found that the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments have a similar affinity for apoA-I (Fig. 3E, appKd). Further analysis of apparent Bmax values, however, revealed that the plasma membrane has approximately a three times greater capacity to accommodate apoA-I than the intracellular compartments (Fig. 3E, appBmax). In concordance with results shown in Fig. 1D, mock cells failed to bind and internalize significant amounts of 125I-apoA-I (not shown). Using a similar approach, we also performed a time course experiment (Fig. 3D). We found that 125I-apoA-I rapidly saturated the cell surface, whereas its appearance in intracellular compartments was slightly delayed (Fig. 3E, Kon). These results also indicated that, at equilibrium, internalized apoA-I represented ∼27% of whole cell-associated apoA-I. The lipidation and the subsequent dissociation of apoA-I from cells is thought to form HDL particles. To evaluate the potencies of the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments to release apoA-I to the medium, we investigated the respective kinetics of dissociation from each compartment. The cells were first incubated for 2 h with 125I-apoA-I to saturate all compartments. Next, plasma membrane 125I-apoA-I was stripped, and the cells were chased in 125I-apoA-I free medium for up to 6 h. The specific radioactivity associated with the whole cells and intracellular compartments was monitored at all time points. The plasma membrane-associated 125I-apoA-I was then calculated (total minus intracellular). As shown in Fig. 4A, the specific radioactivity associated with both compartments decreased over time. The dissociation of 125I-apoA-I from the plasma membrane, however, was rapid (Koff pm = 0.25 ± 0.06 min-1) compared with the 125I-apoA-I release from intracellular compartments (Koff intra = 0.02 ± 0.01 min-1). The slow release of apoA-I from the intracellular compartments was also evident in terms of t½ (t½pm =∼2.8 min and t½ intra =∼38.4 min). These results, together with results shown in Fig. 3E, suggested that the association/dissociation kinetics of apoA-I with the plasma membrane (on and off rates) are much faster than that of intracellular compartments. The residence time of apoA-I at the plasma membrane is therefore likely to be short. Having shown that internalized apoA-I colocalized with LysoTracker, we next investigated whether internalized apoA-I was significantly degraded. The dissociation medium obtained from stripped cells used in Fig. 4A was collected, and the amount of degraded material appearing in the medium was quantified by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. In a separate control experiment, intact 125I-apoA-I was seen to be efficiently precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (>97%). We therefore used this approach to quantify the amount of intact 125I-apoA-I in trichloroacetic acid pellets and the amount of degraded material in trichloroacetic acid supernatants. Fig. 4B shows that ∼80% of the radioactivity released from the intracellular compartments appeared as degraded product, likely because of lysosomal degradation. The remaining 20% of radioactivity was intact 125I-apoA-I (pellets) and appeared in the medium at a rate of Kmed = 0.05 ± 0.01 min-1 (t½ =∼12.6 min), similar to bulk membrane recycling (t½ =∼15 min) (25Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). This suggested that not all internalized apoA-I was targeted for lysosomal degradation. We next determined by two-dimensional nondenaturing gels whether these intact 125I-apoA-I molecules from the intracellular pool are nascent HDL particles. We observed that the intact 125I-apoA-I released from intracellular pools is effectively converted to normal size nascent HDL particles (Fig. 4C). Using the parameters obtained from above, we estimated the extent of degradation and the relative contribution of endosomal recycling to the generation of HDL. Although ∼27% of cell-associated apoA-I is intracellular at steady state (Fig. 3C), the dissociation rate of apoA-I from the plasma membrane is five times faster than the rate of release of intact apoA-I from intracellular compartments (compare plasma membrane Koff values with intact apoA-I Kmed obtained from Fig. 4). Taking that into account, we deduced the following (Fig. 5). At steady state, for every 100 molecules that interact with whole cells, 73 are bound to the cell surface, whereas 27 are internalized. From those internalized, five (20% of internalized apoA-I) may return to extracellular medium as an intact molecule, whereas the remaining 22 (80%) will be degraded. However, for every cycle of internalization/resecretion, the 73 molecules of apoA-I on the plasma membrane would associate/dissociate approximately five times. The plasma membrane could therefore potentially release 365 molecules of apoA-I (73 × 5 molecules) into the medium for each cycle of internalization/resecretion. Therefore, the apoA-I degradation represents 5.6% of total apoA-I that interacted with cells (22/(27 + 365) molecules), suggesting that lysosomal degradation is a minor process compared with the overall lipidation of apoA-I. More importantly, our calculations indicate that the contribution of resecreted intact apoA-I, relative to the total number of apoA-I molecules converted to nascent HDL particles, is ∼1.4% (5/(5 + 365) molecules). We conclude that internalization of apoA-I does not significantly contribute to the formation of nascent HDL particles. Interestingly, previous studies have employed pharmacological reagents to block endocytosis and found diminished cholesterol efflux to apoA-I (11Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 26Lorenzi I. von Eckardstein A. Cavelier C. Radosavljevic S. Rohrer L. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We therefore tested two additional reagents known also to inhibit endocytosis. The cells were treated with cytochalasin D, an actin filament-disrupting drug known to acutely and reversibly inhibit endocytosis (27Chadda R. Howes M.T. Plowman S.J. Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Mayor S. Traffic. 2007; 8: 702-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and this reduced Cy3.5-apoA-I endocytosis by ∼80% (Fig. 6, A and B). Under those conditions, inhibiting endocytosis did not decrease apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux (Fig. 6C). Similar results were obtained using RAW macrophages induced with 8-bromo-cAMP (supplemental Fig. S4). Two-dimensional gel analysis of the efflux medium further confirmed that blocking endocytosis did not interfere with the generation of α-migrating HDL particles (Fig. 6D). Using sucrose (30 min) to block apoA-I endocytosis also failed to decrease [3H]cholesterol efflux or nascent HDL production (data not shown). This suggests that blocking endocytosis does not necessarily inhibit cholesterol efflux or the generation of nascent HDL particles. Interestingly, cytochalasin D also increased the amount of intact 125I-apoA-I found in the medium (Fig. 6E), presumably by preventing lysosomal degradation. Here, we have studied the fate of endocytosed apoA-I and its relative contribution to the formation of nascent HDL particles. Pioneering studies by Takahashi and Smith (11Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and others (10Neufeld E.B. Stonik J.A. Demosky Jr., S.J. Knapper C.L. Combs C.A. Cooney A. Comly M.

Med. 2008; 86: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) showed that apoA-I is internalized and that endocytosed apoA-I shuttles back to the plasma membrane to be resecreted. Our results here largely confirm these observations. A fraction of apoA-I colocalized with Tf-positive compartments even after 2-h chase (Fig. 2A, lower panel) and indeed was resecreted as HDL particles (Fig. 4C). However, when we compared the magnitude of HDL generation from this retro-endocytosis mechanism with the overall HDL production in ABCA1-expressing cells, we found that the retro-endocytosis pathway does not contribute significantly to HDL formation. Several lines of evidence from our findings point toward the plasma membrane as the primary location of HDL biogenesis. First, we found that most of internalized apoA-I colocalized with the bulk phase uptake marker (Fig. 2B) and, by 6 h, ∼80% appeared in LysoTracker-positive compartments (Fig. 2C), suggesting that very little apoA-I recycles back to the plasma membrane. Second, internalized apoA-I was extensively degraded (80%). Third, and perhaps most importantly, the majority of the apoA-I is on the cell surface (>70%) and is released from the plasma membrane at least five times faster (t½ pm =∼2.8 min) than from endosomal recycling (t½ medium =∼12.6 min). This means that apoA-I on the plasma membrane can be converted to HDL five times faster than resecreted internalized apoA-I. Altogether, these results make the plasma membrane the predominant location where HDL is produced. Our conclusion that apoA-I internalization plays a minor role in ABCA1-mediated HDL generation is in apparent discrepancy with previous studies (11Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 26Lorenzi I. von Eckardstein A. Cavelier C. Radosavljevic S. Rohrer L. J. Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In those studies, when endocytosis of apoA-I was blocked by pharmacological reagents, there was a concomitant inhibition of cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. apoA-I internalization therefore was thought to be one of the required elements for cholesterol efflux. However, these pharmacological reagents are non-specific and have multiple known effects on cell functions (28Sieczkarski S.B. Whittaker G.R. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 29Sigal N.H. Dumont F.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 519-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). To avoid this issue, we have developed a protocol that removes surface-bound apoA-I with high specificity and efficiency. This allowed us, for the first time, to dissect the contribution of internalized and surface-bound apoA-I to HDL formation in unperturbed cells. The kinetic parameters from these biochemical analyses indicate a rather minor contribution of resecreted apoA-I to HDL generation. Interestingly, we also used two pharmacological reagents (cytochalasin D and sucrose) that block apoA-I endocytosis but found no effect on cholesterol efflux. This highlights the difficulties in interpreting observations obtained using pharmacological inhibitors. Our results show that apoA-I rapidly dissociates from the plasma membrane to form HDL. A similar dissociation of apoA-I from the membrane inside the endosome could explain why internalized apoA-I was eventually targeted to the lysosomes. We observed that, although initially membrane-bound, internalized apoA-I did not follow the membrane recycling pathway as other membrane-bound proteins, such as Tf. Instead, apoA-I followed the bulk lumen marker dextran. This indicates that apoA-I must have rapidly dissociated from the membrane after internalization and appeared in the lumen of the endosomes. The dissociation could be due to increasing acidity in the endosomes, similar to the dissociation of low density lipoprotein from its receptor (30Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4348) Google Scholar). This is, however, unlikely because the apoA-I/membrane association was unaffected by acid washing. Alternatively, apoA-I may acquire lipids and thus dissociate into the lumen of the organelle leading to its lysosomal delivery. The rapid lipidation of apoA-I in the endocytic pathway therefore likely contributes to its lysosomal destination and, by doing so, largely excludes it from participating in the production of HDL. We show that internalized apoA-I did not significantly colocalize with ABCA1, consistent with recent studies showing that only a minor fraction of apoA-I is bound to ABCA1 (21Hassan H.H. Denis M. Lee D.Y. Iatan I. Nyholt D. Ruel I. Krimbou L. Genest J. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2428-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Vedhachalam C. Ghering A.B. Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). By remaining bound to ABCA1, apoA-I may undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis. The apoA-I·ABCA1 complex would then recycle back to the cell surface, thereby protecting both apoA-I and ABCA1 from degradation (31Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The BHK-ABCA1 cell model used here admittedly has some limitations. However, we showed here that extracellular lipid-poor apoA-I is rapidly endocytosed and targeted to lysosome in most cell types, including hepatocytes. Although the liver is a major source of HDL in vivo, hepatocytes may not depend on extracellular apoA-I lipidation to produce HDL. Indeed, apoA-I has been shown to be secreted as lipidated particles, presumably because of intracellular lipidation along the secretory pathway (32Kiss R.S. McManus D.C. Franklin V. Tan W.L. McKenzie A. Chimini G. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10119-10127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This process could not be explored in our system. More research will be required to elucidate the relative contribution of the de novo secretory pathway versus the plasma membrane lipidation pathway in hepatocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative analysis of the fate of endocytosed apoA-I. We report that HDL is mainly produced from the plasma membrane, not in the retro-endocytosis pathway. Our results therefore dismiss one of the predominant models in the ABCA1 research field. Interestingly, the conclusions presented here are concordant with a recent report in which apoA-I preferentially interacts with membranes bearing positive curvatures (33Vedhachalam C. Duong P.T. Nickel M. Nguyen D. Dhanasekaran P. Saito H. Rothblat G.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25123-25130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), a unique characteristic of the plasma membrane. The search for the molecular mechanism by which ABCA1 generates HDL can now focus on the plasma membrane. More importantly, we can now also hypothesize the importance of the physical properties of the plasma membrane in HDL generation and anticipate new therapeutic strategies to raise HDL in vivo by manipulating the plasma membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2044376274,"Background Beneficial effects of short-term erythropoietin (EPO) therapy have been demonstrated in several animal models of acute neurologic injury, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-the animal model of multiple sclerosis. We have found that EPO treatment substantially reduces the acute clinical paralysis seen in EAE mice and this improvement is accompanied by a large reduction in the mononuclear cell infiltration and downregulation of glial MHC class II expression within the inflamed CNS. Other reports have recently indicated that peripherally generated anti-inflammatory CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the IL17-producing CD4+ T helper cell (Th17) subpopulations play key antagonistic roles in EAE pathogenesis. However, no information regarding the effects of EPO therapy on the behavior of the general mononuclear-lymphocyte population, Tregs or Th17 cells in EAE has emerged. Methods and Findings We first determined in vivo that EPO therapy markedly suppressed MOG specific T cell proliferation and sharply reduced the number of reactive dendritic cells (CD11c positive) in EAE lymph nodes during both inductive and later symptomatic phases of MOG35–55 induced EAE. We then determined the effect in vivo of EPO on numbers of peripheral Treg cells and Th17 cells. We found that EPO treatment modulated immune balance in both the periphery and the inflamed spinal cord by promoting a large expansion in Treg cells, inhibiting Th17 polarization and abrogating proliferation of the antigen presenting dendritic cell population. Finally we utilized tissue culture assays to show that exposure to EPO in vitro similarly downregulated MOG-specific T cell proliferation and also greatly suppressed T cell production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions Taken together, our findings reveal an important new locus whereby EPO induces substantial long-term tissue protection in the host through signaling to several critical subsets of immune cells that reside in the peripheral lymphatic system."

However, the value of endoscopic surveillance in Barrett's esophagus has been debated because of the low incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. Moreover, high inter-observer and sampling-dependent variation in the histologic staging of dysplasia make clinical risk assessment problematic. In this study, we developed a 3-tiered risk stratification strategy, based on systematically selected epigenetic and clinical parameters, to improve Barrett's esophagus surveillance efficiency. Methods and Findings We defined high-grade dysplasia as endpoint of progression, and Barrett's esophagus progressor patients as Barrett's esophagus patients with either no dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia who later developed high-grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma. We analyzed 4 epigenetic and 3 clinical parameters in 118 Barrett's esophagus tissues obtained from 35 progressor and 27 non-progressor Barrett's esophagus patients from Baltimore Veterans Affairs Maryland Health Care Systems and Mayo Clinic. Based on 2-year and 4-year prediction models using linear discriminant analysis (area under the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve: 0.8386 and 0.7910, respectively), Barrett's esophagus specimens were stratified into high-risk (HR), intermediate-risk (IR), or low-risk (LR) groups. This 3-tiered stratification method retained both the high specificity of the 2-year model and the high sensitivity of the 4-year model. Progression-free survivals differed significantly among the 3 risk groups, with p = 0.0022 (HR vs. IR) and p<0.0001 (HR or IR vs. LR). Incremental value analyses demonstrated that the number of methylated genes contributed most influentially to prediction accuracy. Conclusions This 3-tiered risk stratification strategy has the potential to exert a profound impact on Barrett's esophagus surveillance accuracy and efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2024981087,"Increased tolerance to antimicrobial agents is thought to be an important feature of microbes growing in biofilms. We address the question of how biofilm organization affects antibiotic susceptibility. We established Escherichia coli biofilms with differential structural organization due to the presence of IncF plasmids expressing altered forms of the transfer pili in two different biofilm model systems. The mature biofilms were subsequently treated with two antibiotics with different molecular targets, the peptide antibiotic colistin and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. The dynamics of microbial killing were monitored by viable count determination, and confocal laser microscopy. Strains forming structurally organized biofilms show an increased bacterial survival when challenged with colistin, compared to strains forming unstructured biofilms. The increased survival is due to genetically regulated tolerant subpopulation formation and not caused by a general biofilm property. No significant difference in survival was detected when the strains were challenged with ciprofloxacin. Our data show that biofilm formation confers increased colistin tolerance to cells within the biofilm structure, but the protection is conditional being dependent on the structural organization of the biofilm, and the induction of specific tolerance mechanisms."

In addition, we assessed plasma levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor in a subset of 214 women included at least six months after delivery. After adjustment for maternal age and chronic hypertension, attenuating allelic variants of TLR4 were more common in women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia than in controls (OR 2.9 [95% CI 1.2-6.7]). Highest frequencies for TLR4 variants were observed in women who developed HELLP syndrome (adjusted OR 4.1 [95% CI 1.7-9.8]). In addition, high levels of interleukin-6 and fibrinogen were associated with a history of early-onset preeclampsia. Combined positivity for any of the TLR4 and NOD2 allelic variants and high levels of interleukin-6 was 6.9-fold more common in women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia (95% CI 2.1-23.2) compared to controls.We observed an association of common TLR4 and NOD2 gene variants, and pro-inflammatory phenotype with a history of early-onset preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome.

The remarkable diversity of sesquiterpene structure and stereochemistry is the consequence of precise control exerted by the cyclase over the conformations of the flexible substrate and carbocation intermediates in the cyclization cascade. Aristolochene synthase from Aspergillus terreus is a sesquiterpene cyclase that catalyzes the cyclization of FPP to form aristolochene (Fig. 1a), the parent hydrocarbon of a large group of fungal toxins such as gigantenone, PR-toxin, and bipolaroxin (8Proctor R.H. Hohn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4543-4548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to aristolochene synthase from Penicillium roqueforti, which generates aristolochene predominantly (>90%) but also small amounts of germacrene A and valencene (9Felicetti B. Cane D.E. J.

Each cyclase adopts the common α-helical fold of a class I terpenoid cyclase and contains two conserved metal binding motifs: the “aspartate-rich” motif D90DLLE that coordinates to Mg2+A and Mg2+C, and the “NSE/DTE” motif N219DIYSYEKE that chelates Mg2+B (boldface residues are metal ligands) (11Shishova E.Y. Di Costanzo L. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies show that the binding of Mg2+3·PPi stabilizes the active site in a closed conformation that is completely sequestered from bulk solvent (Fig. 1b) (11Shishova E.Y.

In addition to multiple metal coordination interactions, the PPi anion accepts hydrogen bonds from conserved residues Arg175, Lys226, Arg314, and Tyr315 when bound to the closed conformation (Fig. 1c). It is likely that the diphosphate group of FPP makes identical metal coordination and hydrogen bond interactions in the Michaelis complex, i.e. the complex between the enzyme and the productively bound substrate that immediately precedes the initiation of the cyclization cascade.FIGURE 1Aristolochene synthase reaction. a, cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form aristolochene (OPP = diphosphate, PPi = pyrophosphate). b, superposition of monomer D of unliganded aristolochene synthase in the open conformation (red), the closed conformation in the Mg2+3·PPi complex (green) (11Shishova E.Y.

After the initial 10-h incubation, 500 nm enzyme and 50 μm 2F-FPP or DF-FPP were added twice into the aqueous reaction layer at 6-h intervals. Reaction products were extracted with high-performance liquid chromatography-grade n-pentane, and the organic extract was passed through a 3-cm 230-400 mesh silica gel column. The purified extract was concentrated on an ice-water mixture under reduced pressure until the volume was decreased to ∼50 μl. The resulting concentrate was analyzed using a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 mass selective detector and equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (0.25 mm inner diameter × 30 m with 0.25-μm film, Agilent Technologies). Typically, a 2-μl sample was injected in splitless mode into the GS-MS. The oven temperature was at 35 °C for 1 min, then raised to 230 °C at the rate of 5 °C/min, and then followed by a 20 °C/min increase to 280 °C. The temperature was maintained at 280 °C for 20 min. Crystal Structure Determinations of Enzyme Complexes with FPP, 2F-FPP, and DF-FPP—Recombinant A. terreus aristolochene synthase was crystallized by the hanging drop, vapor diffusion method at 4 °C as previously described (11Shishova E.Y. Di Costanzo L. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The structures of complexes with substrate FPP and substrate analogues 2F-FPP and DF-FPP were determined by soaking crystals of the unliganded enzyme for 20-24 h in a buffer solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 18% polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm substrate or substrate analogue. X-ray diffraction data were collected from crystals of each complex at the Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source and processed using HKL (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 306-326Google Scholar) or Mosflm (17Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierry J.C. Crystallographic Computing V. Molecular Data Processing. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1991: 27-38Google Scholar). Crystals were isomorphous with those of the unliganded enzyme (space group P21, a = 61.2 Å, b = 147.2 Å, c = 83.7 Å, β = 97.9°, with four molecules in the asymmetric unit (11Shishova E.Y. Di Costanzo L. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)). Iterative rounds of refinement and model adjustment for each complex were performed using CNS and O, respectively (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Individual B-factors were refined in each complex. The N termini Met1-Ser12, C termini Val318-Asp320, and loop segments Ser231-Gly239 were disordered in all monomers of each structure. Additionally, loop segments Phe46-Pro47 and Arg160-Thr161 were disordered in monomer D of the FPP complex, loop segment Leu286-Glu287 was disordered in monomer C of the 2F-FPP complex, and loop segments Asn45-Asn48, Lys54-Phe55, and Tyr95-Ser97 were disordered in monomer D of the DF-FPP complex. Disordered residues were excluded from the final model of each complex. The exclusion of 111/1280 residues from each tetramer (8.7% of the scattering matter) likely contributed to the somewhat higher than expected R and Rfree values recorded in Table 1. Continuous electron density peaks adjacent to 5, 3, and 2 cysteine residues, respectively, were modeled as disulfide-linked β-mercaptoethanol molecules in the FPP, 2F-FPP, and DF-FPP complexes. Data collection and refinement statistics for each complex are recorded in Table 1. The figures were generated using the program PyMOL. 3DeLano, W. L.

Open table in a new tab Reactivity of Fluorinated Substrates—Aristolochene synthase from A. terreus generates (+)-aristolochene as its sole product from reaction with substrate FPP (9Felicetti B. Cane D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 7212-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, following incubation with 2F-FPP in solution, two products are identified in a 95:5 ratio by GS-MS (Fig. 2). The chemical ionization mass spectrum of the major peak eluting at 25.1 min corresponds to a fluorinated sesquiterpene (C15H23F) with m/z = 222 (data not shown). This result is consistent with the generation of 2-fluorogermacrene A, as observed after incubating aristolochene synthase from P. roqueforti with 2F-FPP (12Miller D.J. Yu F. Allemann R.K. Chembiochem. 2007; 8: 1819-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The small peak at 23.37 min has a chemical ionization spectrum indicative of a non-fluorinated sesquiterpene (C15H24) with M-1 = 204 (data not shown); this is presumed to be a degradation product. A control experiment conducted in the absence of enzyme indicates that 2F-FPP itself does not react to yield any extractable products based on GC-MS analysis. Incubation of A. terreus aristolochene synthase with DF-FPP for 30 h using the approach described above for 2F-FPP does not generate any pentane-extractable products based on GC-MS analysis. This is consistent with the lack of activity with DF-FPP reported for aristolochene synthase from P. roqueforti, against which DF-FPP is a reversible competitive inhibitor with Ki = 0.8 μm (13Yu F. Miller D.J. Allemann R.K. Chem. Comm. 2007; : 4155-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Crystal Structure of the Complex with FPP—The structure of tetrameric aristolochene synthase determined from crystals soaked in a buffer solution containing FPP reveals that monomers A-D adopt open active site conformations similar to those of the unliganded enzyme (11Shishova E.Y. Di Costanzo L. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Intact FPP molecules with partially similar folded conformations bind in the active site clefts of monomers A, B, and C (Fig. 3, a and b), whereas Mg2+B·PPi binds in the active site cleft of monomer D (Fig. 3c). The r.m.s. deviations of 295 Cα atoms in monomers A and B with the corresponding monomers in the unliganded enzyme are 0.28 Å and 0.26 Å, respectively, indicating that these monomers remain in predominantly open conformations. However, some slight structural changes were observed in monomers C and D that reflect the very initial stages of a transition to the closed conformation: helices C1, D, and D1 and loops A-C1 and D-D1 shift slightly toward their expected positions in the closed conformation of monomer C, and helices C1 and H do likewise in monomer D (for reference, the locations of these structural elements are indicated in Fig. 1b). Accordingly, the r.m.s. deviations with the unliganded enzyme are larger for these monomers: 0.59 Å for 295 Cα atoms in monomer C, and 0.51 Å for 290 Cα atoms in monomer D. Even so, the active sites of monomers C and D remain in predominantly open, solvent-exposed conformations. In each of monomers A, B, and C, the terminal diphosphate group of FPP accepts hydrogen bonds from Arg314 and Tyr315, and the terminal isoprenoid group of FPP is nestled between Phe87 and Phe153. The conformation of the middle isoprenoid moiety of FPP in monomer B is flipped, however, compared with that observed in monomers A and C, both of which have the predicted relative and absolute orientation of the C3 and C7 methyl groups (Fig. 3b). Notably, none of the observed FPP conformations correspond to that required for the formation of germacrene A (the first intermediate in aristolochene biosynthesis), because the electrophilic C1 atom is positioned ∼6 Å away from the C10-C11 π bond and is not properly oriented for the C1-C10 bond-forming step. The binding of FPP to monomers A, B, and C thus may provide “snapshots” of possible substrate binding conformations in the open active site prior to metal ion binding and active site closure. The active site cleft of monomer D contains only the Mg2+B·PPi complex (Fig. 3c). Notably, only monomer D appears to be capable of achieving the closed conformation required for catalysis in complex with Mg2+3·PPi (11Shishova E.Y. Di Costanzo L. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although aristolochene synthase from A. terreus is a dimer in solution (11Shishova E.Y. Di Costanzo L. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the assembly of two dimers to form the tetramer observed in the crystal structure may hinder the conformational transition from the open, inactive state to the closed, active state, thereby accounting for the attenuation of catalytic activity with increasing protein concentrations (9Felicetti B. Cane D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 7212-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Additionally, catalytically required conformational changes may be hindered in monomers A-C due to crystal lattice contacts. In monomer D, the observed single-metal ion complex Mg2+B·PPi is presumably a remnant of the FPP cyclization reaction catalyzed by this monomer in the crystal. This structure represents the first observation of product PPi binding to the predominantly open active site conformation of a wild-type terpenoid cyclase. Because the orientation of PPi bound in the presence of Mg2+B in monomer D differs from the orientations of the FPP diphosphate groups in monomers A-C (Fig. 3d), Mg2+B coordination interactions are presumed to play an important role in orienting the substrate diphosphate group and PPi anion. Superposition of the Mg2+B·PPi complex in the open active site conformation and the Mg2+3·PPi complex in the closed active site conformation reveals a similar binding mode for the Mg2+B·PPi moiety (Fig. 3d). Thus, it appears that Mg2+B is the key metal ion governing the proper binding orientation of PPi. Hydrogen bond interactions with Arg314 and Tyr315 also orient the binding of PPi. Interestingly, although Arg175 and Lys226 donate hydrogen bonds to PPi in the Mg2+3·PPi complex in the closed active site conformation (Fig. 1c) (11Shishova E.Y. Di Costanzo L. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), these residues do not interact with the diphosphate groups of PPi or FPP in the open active site conformation. The binding of PPi to the open conformation of monomer D may provide a snapshot of a possible complex just prior to product release at the conclusion of the cyclization cascade. Crystal Structure of the Complex with 2F-FPP—Despite the evidence for catalytic activity with 2F-FPP in solution (Fig. 2), the crystal structure of the aristolochene synthase tetramer complexed with 2F-FPP reveals the binding of intact 2F-FPP to all four monomers with open active site conformations. As observed in the FPP complex, slight structural changes are observed in monomers C and D that appear to reflect the very initial stages of a transition to the closed conformation. The r.m.s. deviations with the unliganded enzyme are 0.26 Å, 0.29 Å, 0.57 Å, and 0.52 Å for monomers A, B, C, and D, respectively. Electron density corresponding to the diphosphate group of 2F-FPP is well defined in monomers A and D (Fig. 4a) but ambiguous in monomers B and C (data not shown). Only one metal ion, Mg2+B, is bound in this complex, and it binds only to the enzyme·substrate complex in monomer D. Here, the substrate diphosphate group chelates Mg2+B and accepts hydrogen bonds from Arg314, Tyr315, and Lys226. The position and orientation of the diphosphate group of 2F-FPP is roughly comparable to that of PPi in the Mg2+B·PPi complex (Fig. 4b). Strikingly, comparison of the metal-free and metal-bound conformations of 2F-FPP in monomers A and D, respectively, reveals a significant Mg2+B-dependent reorientation of the substrate (Fig. 4c). Thus, it appears that Mg2+B is the key metal ion governing the proper binding orientation of the substrate diphosphate group. In each monomer, the fluorine atom of 2F-FPP accepts a hydrogen bond from Lys181. As observed for FPP, the terminal isoprenoid group of 2F-FPP is nestled between residues Phe87 and Phe153, but the 2F-FPP molecules adopt somewhat varying folded conformations in each monomer. Because none of the observed 2F-FPP conformations in monomers A-D are consistent with that required for C1-C10 bond formation in the first step of catalysis, the observed binding conformations of 2F-FPP in the presence or absence of Mg2+B suggest that additional metal ion binding and active site closure are necessary to chaperone the substrate into a cyclization-competent conformation. Regardless, the complexes of 2F-FPP with monomers A-D provide additional snapshots of possible substrate binding modes to the open active site conformation prior to and subsequent to the binding of Mg2+B. Crystal Structure of the Complex with DF-FPP—The crystal structure of aristolochene synthase complexed with DF-FPP reveals the binding of the intact substrate analogue to the open active site conformations of monomers A, B, and C; the r.m.s. deviations with the unliganded enzyme are 0.30 Å, 0.31 Å, and 0.58 Å, respectively. A representative electron density map of DF-FPP bound to monomer B is shown in Fig. 5a. No metal ions accompany DF-FPP binding, and the observed isoprenoid and diphosphate conformations are somewhat variable, suggesting some degree of disorder (Fig. 5b). The binding of DF-FPP to monomers A-C provides additional snapshots of substrate binding conformations that, in the absence of metal ion binding and full active site closure, are not cyclization-competent. In contrast, monomer D adopts a predominantly closed conformation and contains a PPi anion complexed with Mg2+B and Mg2+C (Fig. 5c). There is no residual electron density in the active site to indicate that an intact DF-FPP molecule is present but disordered. A key conformational change evident in this structure is that the aspartate-rich and NSE/DTE metal ion binding motifs on helices D and H, respectively, are brought closer together to accommodate the binding of the binuclear magnesium cluster. Reflecting this significant conformational change, the r.m.s. deviation of 278 Ca atoms with the unliganded structure is 0.83 Å. Although the incubation of DF-FPP with the A. terreus enzyme (data not shown) or the P. roqueforti enzyme (13Yu F. Miller D.J. Allemann R.K. Chem. Comm. 2007; : 4155-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) yields no observable products, it is possible that a slow reaction with this substrate analogue occurs over the time course of the x-ray crystallographic experiment to yield the observed PPi product. Notably, the Oδ1 and Oδ2 atoms of Asp90 coordinate to Mg2+C with bidentate geometry, whereas in the complex of aristolochene synthase with Mg2+3·PPi, Asp90 coordinates to both Mg2+A and Mg2+C with syn-syn bidentate geometry (i.e. Asp90 Oδ1 coordinates to Mg2+A and Asp90 Oδ2 coordinates to Mg2+C) (11Shishova E.Y. Di Costanzo L. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Some, but not all, hydrogen bond interactions observed in the Mg2+3·PPi cluster (11Shishova E.Y. Di Costanzo L. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) are observed in the Mg2+B·Mg2+C·PPi complex: Arg314 and Tyr315 donate hydrogen bonds to PPi, but Lys226 is characterized by poor electron density and appears to be somewhat disordered, and Arg175 is too far from PPi (5.7 Å) to be considered a formal hydrogen bond donor. Importantly, this structure reveals that only 2 Mg2+ ions are needed to stabilize the predominantly closed active site conformation. Specifically, the binding of Mg2+C to the FPP/PPi·Mg2+B complex appears to be the key molecular event that triggers the conformational transition of the active site from the open state to the closed state. The binding of Mg2+A to complete the trinuclear magnesium cluster also completes these conformational transitions such that the r.m.s. deviation of 295 Cα atoms between open and closed conformations is 1.5 Å. The three crystal structures reported herein contain 12 independent structures of A. terreus aristolochene synthase monomers that illuminate an unprecedented array of binding interactions: nine examples of substrate binding in the absence of Mg2+ to the open active site conformation; one example of substrate binding to the open active site conformation in the presence of one metal ion, Mg2+B; one example of PPi binding to the open active site conformation in the presence of one metal ion, Mg2+B; and one example of PPi binding to the predominantly closed active site conformation in the presence of two metal ions, Mg2+B and Mg2+C. Along with the structure of PPi binding to the closed active site conformation in the presence of all three metal ions, Mg2+A, Mg2+B, and Mg2+C (11Shishova E.Y. Di Costanzo L. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), these structures suggest a possible sequence for metal ion binding and conformational changes required for catalysis. Substrate Conformation—The observed conformations of intact FPP, 2F-FPP, and DF-FPP are not cyclization-competent due to the fact that they are bound to the open active site conformation. This is a direct consequence of incomplete metal binding, because a complete trinuclear magnesium cluster is required to stabilize the fully closed active site conformation. It is only in the closed conformation that the active site is sequestered from bulk solvent, thereby forming a protected environment in which reactive carbocation intermediates can be formed without the risk of premature quenching by solvent. Interestingly, most of the crystal structures reported to date of class I terpenoid cyclases complexed with isoprenoid substrate analogues similarly reveal isoprenoid conformations that are not catalytically competent (21Whittington D.A. Wise M.L. Urbansky M. Coates R.M. Croteau R.B. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15375-15380Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 22Starks C.M. Back K. Chappell J. Noel J.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 23Hyatt D.C. Youn B. Zhao Y. Santhamma B. Coates R.M. Croteau R.B. Kang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5360-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As with aristolochene synthase, this often appears to be a consequence of incomplete or compromised metal binding, e.g. as observed in the complex of 5-epi aristolochene synthase with trifluorofarnesyl diphosphate (22Starks C.M. Back K. Chappell J. Noel J.P. Science. 1997; 277: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). However, isoprenoid conformations that are not cyclization-competent are occasionally observed in monoterpene cyclase active sites with closed conformations stabilized by complete trinuclear magnesium clusters. For example, the binding of 3-aza-2,3-dihydrogeranyl diphosphate and 3 Mg2+ ions to bornyl diphosphate synthase triggers active site closure, and the position, orientation, and intermolecular contacts of the analogue diphosphate group are nearly identical to those observed in the Mg2+3·PPi complex (21Whittington D.A. Wise M.L. Urbansky M. Coates R.M. Croteau R.B. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15375-15380Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Even so, the conformation of the substrate analogue is inconsistent with that required for cyclization. More recently, cocrystallization of limonene synthase with 2-fluorogeranyl diphosphate yields the structure of the complex with 2-fluoro-(3S)-linalyl diphosphate, a catalytic intermediate, bound with an extended conformation that is not cyclization-competent; in contrast, cocrystallization with racemic 2-fluorolinalyl diphosphate yields the helical, cyclization-competent isoprenoid conformation (23Hyatt D.C. Youn B. Zhao Y. Santhamma B. Coates R.M. Croteau R.B. Kang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5360-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that isomerization of geranyl diphosphate to linalyl diphosphate does not require a cyclization-competent substrate conformation, such a conformation could instead be achieved after formation of the linalyl diphosphate intermediate. Metal Binding—Analyses of enzyme·substrate and enzyme·PPi complexes reported herein and comparisons with the structure of the enzyme·Mg2+3·PPi complex reported previously (11Shishova E.Y. Di Costanzo L. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) lead to a proposed model for substrate and metal binding (Fig. 6). First, hydrogen bond donors Arg314 and Tyr315 would govern the initial molecular recognition of the FPP diphosphate group, perhaps concurrently with binding of the Mg2+B ion by the NSE/DTE motif. Coordination to Mg2+B would reorient the substrate diphosphate group, as exemplified by the Mg2+B-dependent reorientation of the 2F-FPP diphosphate group shown in Fig. 4c. Because it is only Mg2+B that is chelated by three protein residues, it is reasonable to hypothesize that this is the first of the three metal ions to bind (its binding site is largely pre-organized). Some slight conformational changes reflecting the very initial stages of active site closure may be triggered by Mg2+B and/or substrate binding, e.g. as observed in monomers C and D of the FPP/PPi and 2F-FPP complexes. Subsequently, the binding of Mg2+C by both Asp90 and the substrate diphosphate group would trigger more substantial conformational changes leading to active site closure, as illustrated by the Mg2+B·Mg2+C·PPi complex in Fig. 5c. Finally, the binding of Mg2+A would complete the formation of the trinuclear metal ion cluster, causing Mg2+C to shift such that Asp90 would coordinate to both Mg2+A and Mg2+C with syn-syn bidentate geometry. The formation of a complete trinuclear magnesium cluster would complete conformational changes required for full active site closure. In the closed conformation, substrate diphosphate metal ion coordination interactions and hydrogen bond interactions with Arg175, Lys226, Arg314, and Tyr315 would be fully formed, as observed in the Mg2+3·PPi complex (Fig. 1c) (11Shishova E.Y. Di Costanzo L. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1941-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Upon achieving a cyclization-competent substrate conformation in the closed active site, with the three negative charges of the diphosphate leaving group fully neutralized, substrate ionization (24Goodman D.S. Popják G. J. Lipid Res. 1960; 1: 286-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tidd B.K. J. Chem. Soc. B. 1971; : 1168-1176Crossref Google Scholar) and cyclization would be initiated. At the conclusion of the cyclization cascade, we suggest that metal ion dissociation and the transition to the open active site conformation occurs in reverse sequence: Mg2+A would dissociate first, but Mg2+B and Mg2+C would stabilize the active site conformation in a predominantly closed state, e.g. as observed in the Mg2+B·Mg2+C·PPi complex in Fig. 5c. The subsequent dissociation of Mg2+C would then facilitate the transition to an open active site conformation with the release of product aristolochene, and the release of Mg2+B·PPi would conclude the catalytic sequence. Additional support for the proposed role of metal binding in the conformational transition of the terpenoid synthase active site derives from site-directed mutagenesis studies of another fungal sesquiterpene cyclase, trichodiene synthase, related to aristolochene synthase by only 15% amino acid sequence identity. The r.m.s. deviation of 349 Cα atoms between unliganded and Mg2+3·PPi complexed wild-type trichodiene synthase is 1.4 Å (26Rynkiewicz M.J. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In contrast, D100E trichodiene synthase is defective in Mg2+C binding and does not achieve a fully closed active site conformation in its complex with Mg2+A, Mg2+B, and PPi; the r.m.s. deviation of 354 Cα atoms between the unliganded and liganded enzymes is only 0.44 Å (27Rynkiewicz M.J. Cane D.E. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 4: 1732-1741Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, Mg2+C must play a critical role in triggering the structural transition of the trichodiene synthase active site from the open to the closed conformation, just as Mg2+C is proposed to play a critical role in triggering the structural transition of the aristolochene synthase active site from the open to the closed conformation. In accord with the metal binding behavior observed with aristolochene synthase and trichodiene synthase, we conclude that the metal binding sequence summarized in Fig. 6 suggests specific functions for the three metal ions in terpenoid cyclase-catalyzed ionization-cyclization reactions: Mg2+B governs initial enzyme·substrate association; Mg2+C triggers the conformational transition of the active site from the open state to a predominantly closed state in which metal ion binding motifs on helices D and H are brought closer together; and Mg2+A completes the trinuclear magnesium cluster and thereby completes the conformational transition to the closed state and initiates the cyclization cascade. Future studies of site-specific mutants in the metal binding site of aristolochene synthase and other terpenoid cyclases will allow us to test this model of metal ion function.

https://openalex.org/W2071744608,"We report the generation and analysis of mutant mice bearing a targeted disruption of the heparan sulfate (HS)-modifying enzyme GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 3 (NDST3). NDST3(-/-) mice develop normally, are fertile, and show only subtle hematological and behavioral abnormalities in agreement with only moderate HS undersulfation. Compound mutant mice made deficient in NDST2;NDST3 activities also develop normally, showing that both isoforms are not essential for development. In contrast, NDST1(-/-);NDST3(-/-) compound mutant embryos display developmental defects caused by severe HS undersulfation, demonstrating NDST3 contribution to HS synthesis in the absence of NDST1. Moreover, analysis of HS composition in dissected NDST3 mutant adult brain revealed regional changes in HS sulfation, indicating restricted NDST3 activity on nascent HS in defined wild-type tissues. Taken together, we show that NDST3 function is not essential for development or adult homeostasis despite contributing to HS synthesis in a region-specific manner and that the loss of NDST3 function is compensated for by the other NDST isoforms to a varying degree."
https://openalex.org/W2011262151,"Collagens contain cryptic polypeptide modules that regulate major cell functions, such as cell proliferation or death. Collagen XVIII (C18) exists as three amino terminal end variants with specific amino terminal polypeptide modules. We investigated the function of the variant 3 of C18 (V3C18) containing a frizzled module (FZC18), which carries structural identity with the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the frizzled receptors. We show that V3C18 is a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, its topology being mediated by the FZC18 module. V3C18 mRNA was expressed at low levels in 21 normal adult human tissues. Its expression was up-regulated in fibrogenesis and in small well-differentiated liver tumors, but decreased in advanced human liver cancers. Low FZC18 immunostaining in liver cancer nodules correlated with markers of high Wnt/beta-catenin activity. V3C18 (M(r) = 170 kD) was proteolytically processed into a cell surface FZC18-containing 50 kD glycoprotein precursor that bound Wnt3a in vitro through FZC18 and suppressed Wnt3a-induced stabilization of beta-catenin. Ectopic expression of either FZC18 (35 kD) or its 50 kD precursor inhibited Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in colorectal and liver cancer cell lines, thus downregulating major cell cycle checkpoint gatekeepers cyclin D1 and c-myc and reducing tumor cell growth. By contrast, full-length V3C18 was unable to inhibit Wnt signaling. In summary, we identified a cell-surface signaling pathway whereby FZC18 inhibits Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. The signal, encrypted within cell-surface C18, is released by enzymatic processing as an active frizzled cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that reduces cancer cell growth. Thus, extracellular matrix controls Wnt signaling through a collagen-embedded CRD behaving as a cell-surface sensor of proteolysis, conveying feedback cues to control cancer cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2023991830,"Cell migration involves a multitude of signals that converge on cytoskeletal reorganization, essential for development, immune responses and tissue repair. Using knockdown and dominant negative approaches, we show that the microtubule-associated Ste20-like kinase SLK is required for focal adhesion turnover and cell migration downstream of the FAK/c-src complex. Our results show that SLK co-localizes with paxillin, Rac1 and the microtubules at the leading edge of migrating cells and is activated by scratch wounding. SLK activation is dependent on FAK/c-src/MAPK signaling, whereas SLK recruitment to the leading edge is src-dependent but FAK independent. Our results show that SLK represents a novel focal adhesion disassembly signal."
https://openalex.org/W2032521962,"Background Maturity onset diabetes of the young type 2 (or GCK MODY) is a genetic form of diabetes mellitus provoked by mutations in the glucokinase gene (GCK). Methodology/Principal Findings We screened the GCK gene by direct sequencing in 30 patients from South Italy with suspected MODY. The mutation-induced structural alterations in the protein were analyzed by molecular modeling. The patients' biochemical, clinical and anamnestic data were obtained. Mutations were detected in 16/30 patients (53%); 9 of the 12 mutations identified were novel (p.Glu70Asp, p.Phe123Leu, p.Asp132Asn, p.His137Asp, p.Gly162Asp, p.Thr168Ala, p.Arg392Ser, p.Glu290X, p.Gln106_Met107delinsLeu) and are in regions involved in structural rearrangements required for catalysis. The prevalence of mutation sites was higher in the small domain (7/12: ∼59%) than in the large (4/12: 33%) domain or in the connection (1/12: 8%) region of the protein. Mild diabetic phenotypes were detected in almost all patients [mean (SD) OGTT = 7.8 mMol/L (1.8)] and mean triglyceride levels were lower in mutated than in unmutated GCK patients (p = 0.04). Conclusions The prevalence of GCK MODY is high in southern Italy, and the GCK small domain is a hot spot for MODY mutations. Both the severity of the GCK mutation and the genetic background seem to play a relevant role in the GCK MODY phenotype. Indeed, a partial genotype-phenotype correlation was identified in related patients (3 pairs of siblings) but not in two unrelated children bearing the same mutation. Thus, the molecular approach allows the physician to confirm the diagnosis and to predict severity of the mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1982206614,"Loss of function mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB pathway resulted in hyperphagia and morbid obesity in human and rodents. Conversely, peripheral or central stimulation of TrkB by its natural ligands BDNF or NT4 reduced body weight and food intake in mice, supporting the idea that TrkB is a key anorexigenic signal downstream of the melanocortin-4 receptor (Mc4r) system. Here we show that in non-human primates TrkB agonists were anorexigenic when applied centrally, but surprisingly orexigenic, leading to gain in appetite, body weight, fat deposits and serum leptin levels, when given peripherally. The orexigenic and pro-obesity effects of peripherally administered TrkB agonists appear to be dose dependent, not associated with fluid retention nor with evidence of receptor down regulation. Our findings revealed that TrkB signaling exerts dual control on energy homeostasis in the primates that could be targeted for the treatment of either wasting disorders or obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2060229948,"Plants produce p-aminobenzoate (pABA) in chloroplasts and use it for folate synthesis in mitochondria. In plant tissues, however, pABA is known to occur predominantly as its glucose ester (pABA-Glc), and the role of this metabolite in folate synthesis has not been defined. In this study, the UDP-glucose:pABA acyl-glucosyltransferase (pAGT) activity in Arabidopsis extracts was found to reside principally (95%) in one isoform with an apparent Km for pABA of 0.12 mm. Screening of recombinant Arabidopsis UDP-glycosyltransferases identified only three that recognized pABA. One of these (UGT75B1) exhibited a far higher kcat/Km value than the others and a far lower apparent Km for pABA (0.12 mm), suggesting its identity with the principal enzyme in vivo. Supporting this possibility, ablation of UGT75B1 reduced extractable pAGT activity by 95%, in vivo [14C]pABA glucosylation by 77%, and the endogenous pABA-Glc/pABA ratio by 9-fold. The Keq for the pABA esterification reaction was found to be 3 × 10-3. Taken with literature data on the cytosolic location of pAGT activity and on cytosolic UDP-glucose/UDP ratios, this Keq value allowed estimation that only 4% of cytosolic pABA is esterified. That pABA-Glc predominates in planta therefore implies that it is sequestered away from the cytosol and, consistent with this possibility, vacuoles isolated from [14C]pABA-fed pea leaves were estimated to contain≥88% of the [14C]pABA-Glc formed. In total, these data and the fact that isolated mitochondria did not take up [3H]pABA-Glc, suggest that the glucose ester represents a storage form of pABA that does not contribute directly to folate synthesis.

Tetrahydrofolate and its derivatives (folates) are essential cofactors for one-carbon reactions in almost all organisms, but are made only by plants and microbes (1Hanson A.D. Roje S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 2Scott J. Rébeillé F. Fletcher J. J. Sci. Food Agric. 2000; 80: 795-824Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Folates are tripartite molecules comprising pterin, p-aminobenzoate (pABA), 3The abbreviations used are: pABA, p-aminobenzoic acid; pABA-Glc, p-aminobenzoate β-d-glucose ester; pAGT, UDP-glucose:pABA acyl-glucosyltransferase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; UGT, UDP-glucosyltransferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: pABA, p-aminobenzoic acid; pABA-Glc, p-aminobenzoate β-d-glucose ester; pAGT, UDP-glucose:pABA acyl-glucosyltransferase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; UGT, UDP-glucosyltransferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and glutamate moieties (Fig. 1A), and folate synthesis in plants involves three subcellular compartments (Fig. 1B). The pterin moiety is synthesized in the cytosol, pABA is synthesized in chloroplasts, and the two are coupled together, reduced, and glutamylated in mitochondria (3Hanson A.D. Gregory 3rd, J.F. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although folate synthesis itself is fairly well understood, the metabolism and transport of the pathway intermediates, pABA and pterins, are not. Such ignorance impedes rational engineering to enhance folate levels in food crops for improved human health (4Bekaert S. Storozhenko S. Mehrshahi P. Bennett M.J. Lambert W. Gregory 3rd, J.F. Schubert K. Hugenholtz J. Van Der Straeten D. Hanson A.D. Trends Plant Sci. 2008; 13: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).After its formation in chloroplasts, pABA must transit the cytosol before entering mitochondria for folate synthesis (Fig. 1B). As a hydrophobic weak acid, pABA can cross membranes by simple diffusion according to pH and concentration gradients (5Sterling T.M. Balke N.E. Silverman D.S. Plant Physiol. 1990; 92: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, pABA has been shown to occur in plants mainly as its glucose ester (pABA-Glc), which is hydrophilic and almost certainly cannot readily diffuse across membranes (6Quinlivan E.P. Roje S. Basset G. Shachar-Hill Y. Gregory 3rd, J.F. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20731-20737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because free pABA is present only at low concentrations it is entirely conceivable that mitochondria import pABA-Glc and then hydrolyze it to pABA for folate synthesis (Fig. 1B). Nothing is known about this issue or, more generally, about transport of aromatic conjugates by plant mitochondria (7Haferkamp I. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2375-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Nor is it clear whether pABA-Glc is restricted to the cytosol. Vacuoles are well known to import glucose conjugates of aromatic compounds (8Rea P.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2007; 58: 347-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), and experiments with tissue cultures given megadoses of pABA suggest that some of the pABA-Glc formed is probably in vacuoles. Specifically, cell suspension cultures of Solanum laciniatum supplied with 2.5 mmpABA accumulate levels of pABA-Glc that, from osmotic considerations, appear too high to be confined to the cytosol (6Quinlivan E.P.

Indrayanto G. J. Planar Chromat.-Modern TLC. 2000; 13: 114-118Google Scholar). These data invite the questions of whether pABA-Glc import into vacuoles indeed occurs (Fig. 1B), and, if so, whether it is a normal process or a pharmacological aberration.pABA-Glc formation is known to be a reversible reaction mediated by cytosolic UDP-glucose: pABA acyl-glucosyltransferase (pAGT) activity (6Quinlivan E.P.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20731-20737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) but no protein with this activity has yet been identified. However, a prediction about pAGT can be made from bioinformatics. The Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter, Arabidopsis) genome encodes >100 UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGTs) that fall into 14 phylogenetically distinct groups (A to N) (10Ross J. Li Y. Lim E. Bowles D.J. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (reviews 3004): 1-3004.6Crossref Google Scholar). Prior work on recombinant UGTs has shown that enzymes that form glucose esters with various benzoates belong to group L (11Lim E.K. Doucet C.J. Li Y. Elias L. Worrall D. Spencer S.P. Ross J. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 586-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), making it likely that enzymes with pAGT activity are in this group.In this study, we partially characterized pAGT activity extracted from Arabidopsis, screened Arabidopsis group L UGTs for pAGT activity, and biochemically characterized the three most active enzymes. This work implicated UGT75B1 as the main source of pAGT activity in planta, for which supporting evidence came from reverse-genetics. Radiolabeling approaches were used to investigate vacuolar and mitochondrial uptake of pABA-Glc, and to estimate Keq for the esterification reaction. The data strongly suggest that pABA-Glc is not taken up by mitochondria but rather represents a vacuolar storage form of pABA that does not contribute directly to folate synthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Reagents—[Ring-14C]pABA (55 mCi mmol-1), [3,5-3H]pABA (26.2 Ci mmol-1), [3′,5′,7,9-3H]folic acid diammonium salt (43.2 Ci mmol-1), and [2,3,4,5-3H]proline (72.5 Ci mmol-1) were from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). [3H]Proline and [14C]pABA (when used for Keq estimation) were purified as follows. [3H]Proline (108 μCi) was dried in vacuo, redissolved in 5 μl of water and applied to a 1-cm origin on a 10-cm cellulose TLC plate, which was developed in butanol/acetic acid/water (60:15:25, v/v/v). The proline zone (Rf = 0.3) was scraped from the plate and eluted with 3 × 200 μl H2O. [14C]pABA (2.2 μCi) was dried in vacuo, redissolved in 50 μl of water, and separated by HPLC using a Discovery 5-μm C18 (250 × 4.6 mm, Supelco) column; detection was by fluorescence (270 nm excitation, 350 nm emission). The column was eluted (1 ml min-1) with 0.5% acetic acid/methanol (80:20, v/v). Unlabeled pABA-Glc was prepared as described (6Quinlivan E.P. Roje S. Basset G. Shachar-Hill Y. Gregory 3rd, J.F. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20731-20737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). [3H]pABA-Glc was synthesized enzymatically from [3H]pABA (10 μCi, 0.38 nmol), which was dried in vacuo and redissolved in 8 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The reaction (10-μl final volume) contained [3H]pABA, 0.4 μg of UGT75B1, 4 mm UDP-glucose, and 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. The reaction was stopped by freezing in liquid N2. Upon thawing, the [3H]pABA-Glc product was isolated by HPLC as described below. The radiochemical yield was 18%, and radiochemical purity was >99%. UDP-glucose was purchased from Sigma and checked for purity by HPLC (12Goulard F. Diouris M. Deslandes E. Floc'h J.Y. Eur. J. Phycol. 1999; 34: 21-25Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar); purity was determined to be >99%. Dowex (AG) resins were from Bio-Rad. TLC plates were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Protein chromatography columns were from GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ).Plant Materials—Arabidopsis (ecotypes Columbia-0 and Landsberg erecta) plants were grown at 23-28 °C in 12-h days (80 μmol m-2 s-1) in potting soil irrigated with water. For root production, plants were grown hydroponically (13Gibeaut D.M. Hulett J. Cramer G.R. Seemann J.R. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Pea (Pisum sativum cv. Laxtonŉs Improved Progress 9) plants were grown as described (14Orsomando G. Bozzo G.G. de la Garza R.D. Basset G.J. Quinlivan E.P. Naponelli V. Rébeillé F. Ravanel S. Gregory 3rd, J.F. Hanson A.D. Plant J. 2006; 46: 426-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cauliflower was obtained from a local market. The UGT75B1 mutant (line MGT.6017) was identified in the Arabidopsis (ecotype Landsberg erecta) Cold Spring Harbor Genetrap transposon insertion collection. Wild type or homozygous mutant segregants were identified by PCR using gene-specific primers located 5′ or 3′ of the Ds insertion (5′-GGCTAGACTCGAAAACAGAGT-3′ and 5′-CCTCCTCTGCTTCACACAAG-3′, respectively) and a Ds-specific primer (5′-CGCTGGCCTGCCCAACC-3′). Genomic DNA was extracted as described (15Edwards K. Johnstone C. Thompson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). The insertion site was confirmed by sequencing the amplicon from mutant homozygotes. Homozygous mutant and wild-type segregants were selfed, and their progeny were used for experiments.Production and Purification of Recombinant UGTs—Procedures for Escherichia coli expression and protein isolation used to screen glutathione S-transferase-UGT fusions for pAGT activity were as described (16Lim E.K. Roberts M.R. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34920-34925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For further analysis of UGT75B1, UGT74F1, and UGT74F2, fusion constructs were introduced into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL cells (Stratagene), which were grown at 37 °C in LB medium until the A600 reached 0.6. The temperature was then lowered to 25 °C, and isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added (final concentration, 0.5 mm). Incubation was continued for 4 h at 25 °C. Subsequent procedures were at 0-4 °C. Cells from 100-ml cultures were pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and broken in a Mini-Bead Beater (Biospec, Bartlesville, OK). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). To remove co-purifying contaminant proteins, lysates were incubated with 8 m urea-denatured E. coli proteins (17Rohman M. Harrison-Lavoie K.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 20: 45-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The mixture was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was mixed with glutathione-Sepharose resin and purified recombinant UGT recovered as described (16Lim E.K. Roberts M.R. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34920-34925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The purified UGTs were desalted (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) on Sephadex G-25 mini-spin columns, flash-frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Protein was estimated by the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Recombinant proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar).Extraction and Separation of Arabidopsis pAGT Activity—Tissues were pulverized in liquid N2. Protein extraction and purification steps were at 0-4 °C. For tests of pAGT activity in various tissues, protein was extracted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 30 mg/ml polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (2 ml/g fresh weight). The extract was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 20 min), and the supernatant was filtered through a layer of Miracloth, then desalted on a PD-10 column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. For partial purification of pAGT activity, the clarified extract from leaves (13 g) of 5-week-old Columbia-0 plants was brought to 80% saturation with (NH4)2SO4. After stirring for 30 min and centrifuging (13,000 × g, 20 min), the pellet was redissolved in 4.8 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Buffer A) and desalted on PD-10 columns equilibrated with Buffer A. The solution was applied (1 ml min-1) to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with Buffer A, and the column was washed with this buffer until the A280 of the effluent fell to zero. pAGT activity was eluted (1 ml min-1) with a 15-ml gradient of 0-500 mm KCl in Buffer A, collecting 0.3-ml fractions. Active fractions were pooled, brought to 10% (v/v) glycerol, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C until use.pAGT Assays—Activities were measured at 30 °C; product formation was linear with time and amount of protein. Initial screening of recombinant UGTs for pAGT activity was in assay mixtures (200 μl) containing 1 μg of protein (not previously frozen and thawed), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm UDP-glucose, and 1 mmpABA. Reactions were incubated for 30 min, stopped by adding 20 μl of trichloroacetic acid (240 mg ml-1), flash-frozen, and stored at -20 °C before reverse-phase HPLC analysis as described (11Lim E.K.

Kinetic constants of UGT75B1, UGT74F1, and UGT74F2 were measured on purified proteins that had been frozen once, using assay mixtures (20 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 ng of protein, 4 mm UDP-glucose, and the indicated amounts of [14C]pABA and glycerol. Assays were stopped in liquid N2, then applied to AG 4-X4 (OH-) columns to quantify [14C]pABA-Glc formation as described (6Quinlivan E.P. Roje S. Basset G. Shachar-Hill Y. Gregory 3rd, J.F. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20731-20737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A freeze-thaw cycle reduced pAGT specific activities by up to 10-fold, but use of frozen enzymes was deemed acceptable as it allowed analysis of all three UGTs at once. For Arabidopsis pAGT activity, standard reaction mixtures (final volume 20 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, 4-18 μg of protein, 45 μm [14C]pABA, and 4 mm UDP-Glc; [14C]pABA-Glc formation was measured as above. For fractions from Mono Q chromatography, assay mixtures were applied to 1-ml columns of AG 4-X4 (C2H5COO-), from which [14C]pABA-Glc was eluted with 20 ml of water and counted.Estimation of Keq—The Keq for the pABA esterification reaction was estimated by measuring [14C]pABA-Glc formation. Assay mixtures (20 μl final volume) contained 1.5 μg of purified glutathione S-transferase-fused UGT75B1, 10 nmol of UDP-glucose, 9.25 nmol of unlabeled pABA, and 41.3 nCi (0.75 nmol) of purified [14C]pABA in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5, or 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for various times, after which the [14C]pABA-Glc product was quantified by TLC as described (6Quinlivan E.P. Roje S. Basset G. Shachar-Hill Y. Gregory 3rd, J.F.

A 3-μl droplet containing 68 nCi (1.23 nmol) of [14C]pABA and 939 nmol of unlabeled pABA dissolved in water was applied to the cut surface of each leaf. Leaves were incubated in Petri dishes for 3 h at 24 °C in the light (150 μmol m-2 s-1) and then shaken (100 rpm) for 15 min in 5 ml of 0.1 mmpABA to remove non-absorbed label.

Esterified pABA was calculated as (total pABA - free pABA). Data were corrected for recovery using free pABA spikes.Pea Leaf Vacuole Experiments—The surface of the midrib was shaved from the abaxial surface of pea leaflets (1 g, 20-22 leaflets). A solution of [14C]pABA (0.30-0.33 μCi, 5.4-6.0 nmol) dissolved in 3 μl of water was applied to the cut surfaces. Leaflets were incubated in Petri dishes for 3 h at 24 °C in light (150 μmol m-2 s-1). After the incubation, protoplasts were prepared from the [14C]pABA-fed leaflets together with unlabeled pea leaflets (24 g) following a 5-h digestion as described (20Orsomando G. de la Garza R.D.

The protoplast layers were adjusted to 13% Percoll in the same buffer and purified on a three-step sucrose-sorbitol gradient as described (21Bozzo G.G. Basset G.J. Naponelli V. Noiriel A.

Vacuolar yield was quantified by counting protoplast and vacuole preparations using a hemocytometer, and by measuring α-mannosidase activity (22Nok A.J. Shuaibu M.N. Kanbara H. Yanagi T. Parasitol Res. 2000; 86: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The purity of the vacuole fraction was attested by the absence of chlorophyll and by the very low recovery (<0.5%) of mitochondrial (fumarase) and stromal (NADP-linked glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) marker enzyme activities (23Trossat C. Nolte K.D. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The 3H and 14C contents of protoplast lysate and vacuole fractions were determined by scintillation counting. Before HPLC analysis of the vacuolar 14C label, ultrafiltration using a Centricon-10 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) was used to remove Ficoll. The ultrafiltrate was concentrated 2-fold in vacuo before HPLC analysis. HPLC separation was carried out on a Discovery 5-μm C18 (250 × 4.6 mm, Supelco); detection was by absorbance at 295 nm or fluorescence (270 nm excitation, 350 nm emission). The column was eluted (1 ml min-1) with 10% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; fractions (0.33 ml) were collected, and the radioactivity counted.Mitochondrial [3H]pABA-Glc Transport Tests—Mitochondria were isolated from 500 g of cauliflower florets and purified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation (24Douce R. Bourguignon J. Brouquisse R. Neuburger M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 403-415Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The purified mitochondria were resuspended in transport buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.33 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Mitochondrial extracts were obtained by freezing in liquid N2 and thawing at 30 °C (5 cycles), followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. As a quality control, fumarase was assayed in the freshly prepared extract (20Orsomando G. de la Garza R.D. Green B.J. Peng M. Rea P.A. Ryan T.J. Gregory 3rd, J.F. Hanson A.D. J. Biol.

[3H]pABA-Glc transport assays (final volume 500 μl) contained 92 nCi (3.5 pmol) of [3H]pABA-Glc and 1 mm NADH in transport buffer (25Goldraij A. Polacco J.C. Planta. 2000; 210: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Assays were started by adding mitochondria (330 μg protein) and incubated at 30 °C with magnetic stirring. At intervals, 75-μl aliquots were withdrawn, and mitochondria were harvested on a Whatman cellulose nitrate membrane filter (0.45 μm) using a vacuum filtration device. Filters were washed twice with 2 ml of ice-cold transport buffer, added to 3 ml of Beckman Ready Gel scintillation fluid (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), equilibrated, and counted. [3H]Proline uptake was measured by the same method using 254 nCi (3.5 pmol) of [3H]proline.Estimation of Endogenous pABA Production Rate in Arabidopsis—The endogenous pABA production rate in Arabidopsis leaves (∼2.5 pmol mg-1 protein h-1) was estimated from published folate and total pABA contents (6Quinlivan E.P.

A relatively low pABA concentration (45 μm) was used to mimic the cytosolic free pABA concentration, which can be estimated as ≤45 μm from published data on plant pABA contents (6Quinlivan E.P.

Planta. 1994; 193: 530-535Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). pAGT activity was highest in leaves, flowers, and siliques, and was equally high in ecotype Landsberg erecta leaves, which were analyzed for comparison (Fig. 2A). To investigate pAGT isoforms, Columbia leaf activity was fractionated by anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 2B). A single major peak of activity eluted at ∼220 mm NaCl, and a minor peak (representing ≤5% of the total activity) eluted at ∼320 mm. The pAGT activity in leaves thus comes mainly from one isoform. Triplicate determinations of the Km for pABA of the major peak activity gave a value of 0.12 ± 0.02 mm (mean ± S.E.).FIGURE 2pAGT activity in Arabidopsis.

UGT75B1 had high activity, and UGT74F1 and UGT74F2 had moderate activity; the others had lower activity or none (Fig. 3A). The three enzymes with the most activity were kinetically characterized using a sensitive radioassay; the protein preparations used were near homogeneous (Fig. 3B). UGT75B1 was the most active enzyme in terms of its kcat/Km value and had by far the lowest apparent Km (Table 1). Significantly, the Km value of recombinant UGT75B1 was identical (0.12 mm) to that found for the enzyme extracted from Arabidopsis. These results strongly imply that UGT75B1 is the major contributor to pAGT activity in planta.FIGURE 3Characterization of Arabidopsis group L UGTs and of the esterification reaction.A, pAGT activities of 16 members of group L measured using 1 mmpABA and 2.5 mm UDP-glucose.

https://openalex.org/W2044105820,"Proteasome activity is an important part of viral replication. In this study, we examined the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and poliovirus. We found that the proteasome inhibitors significantly suppressed VSV protein synthesis, virus accumulation, and protected infected cells from toxic effect of VSV replication. In contrast, poliovirus replication was delayed, but not diminished in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and Bortezomib. We also found that inhibition of proteasomes stimulated stress-related processes, such as accumulation of chaperone hsp70, phosphorylation of eIF2α, and overall inhibition of translation. VSV replication was sensitive to this stress with significant decline in replication process. Poliovirus growth was less sensitive with only delay in replication. Inhibition of proteasome activity suppressed cellular and VSV protein synthesis, but did not reduce poliovirus protein synthesis. Protein kinase GCN2 supported the ability of proteasome inhibitors to attenuate general translation and to suppress VSV replication. We propose that different mechanisms of translational initiation by VSV and poliovirus determine their sensitivity to stress induced by the inhibition of proteasomes. To our knowledge, this is the first study that connects the effect of stress induced by proteasome inhibition with the efficiency of viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W1987834371,"The alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) are widely studied enzymes and the evolution of the mammalian gene cluster encoding these enzymes is also well studied. Previous studies have shown that the ADH1B*47His allele at one of the seven genes in humans is associated with a decrease in the risk of alcoholism and the core molecular region with this allele has been selected for in some East Asian populations. As the frequency of ADH1B*47His is highest in East Asia, and very low in most of the rest of the world, we have undertaken more detailed investigation in this geographic region.Here we report new data on 30 SNPs in the ADH7 and Class I ADH region in samples of 24 populations from China and Laos. These populations cover a wide geographic region and diverse ethnicities. Combined with our previously published East Asian data for these SNPs in 8 populations, we have typed populations from all of the 6 major linguistic phyla (Altaic including Korean-Japanese and inland Altaic, Sino-Tibetan, Hmong-Mien, Austro-Asiatic, Daic, and Austronesian). The ADH1B genotyping data are strongly related to ethnicity. Only some eastern ethnic phyla or subphyla (Korean-Japanese, Han Chinese, Hmong-Mien, Daic, and Austronesian) have a high frequency of ADH1B*47His. ADH1B haplotype data clustered the populations into linguistic subphyla, and divided the subphyla into eastern and western parts. In the Hmong-Mien and Altaic populations, the extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) and relative EHH (REHH) tests for the ADH1B core were consistent with selection for the haplotype with derived SNP alleles. In the other ethnic phyla, the core showed only a weak signal of selection at best.The selection distribution is more significantly correlated with the frequency of the derived ADH1B regulatory region polymorphism than the derived amino-acid altering allele ADH1B*47His. Thus, the real focus of selection may be the regulatory region. The obvious ethnicity-related distributions of ADH1B diversities suggest the existence of some culture-related selective forces that have acted on the ADH1B region."
https://openalex.org/W2014261716,"Cell migration in blood flow is mediated by engagement of specialized adhesion molecules that function under hemodynamic shear conditions, and many of the effectors of these adhesive interactions, such as the selectins and their ligands, are well defined. However, in contrast, our knowledge of the adhesion molecules operant under lymphatic flow conditions is incomplete. Among human malignancies, head and neck squamous cell cancer displays a marked predilection for locoregional lymph node metastasis. Based on this distinct tropism, we hypothesized that these cells express adhesion molecules that promote their binding to lymphoid tissue under lymphatic fluid shear stress. Accordingly, we investigated adhesive interactions between these and other cancer cells and the principal resident cells of lymphoid organs, lymphocytes. Parallel plate flow chamber studies under defined shear conditions, together with biochemical analyses, showed that human head and neck squamous cell cancer cells express heretofore unrecognized L-selectin ligand(s) that mediate binding to lymphocyte L-selectin at conspicuously low shear stress levels of 0.07-0.08 dynes/cm(2), consistent with lymphatic flow. The binding of head and neck squamous cancer cells to L-selectin displays canonical biochemical features, such as requirements for sialylation, sulfation, and N-glycosylation, but displays a novel operational shear threshold differing from all other L-selectin ligands, including those expressed on colon cancer and leukemic cells (e.g. HCELL). These data define a novel class of L-selectin ligands and expand the scope of function for L-selectin within circulatory systems to now include a novel activity within shear stresses characteristic of lymphatic flow."
https://openalex.org/W2018436391,"Background Cellular processes occur within dynamic and multi-molecular compartments whose characterization requires analysis at high spatio-temporal resolution. Notable examples for such complexes are cell-matrix adhesion sites, consisting of numerous cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. These adhesions are highly variable in their morphology, dynamics, and apparent function, yet their molecular diversity is poorly defined. Methodology/Principal Findings We present here a compositional imaging approach for the analysis and display of multi-component compositions. This methodology is based on microscopy-acquired multicolor data, multi-dimensional clustering of pixels according to their composition similarity and display of the cellular distribution of these composition clusters. We apply this approach for resolving the molecular complexes associated with focal-adhesions, and the time-dependent effects of Rho-kinase inhibition. We show here compositional variations between adhesion sites, as well as ordered variations along the axis of individual focal-adhesions. The multicolor clustering approach also reveals distinct sensitivities of different focal-adhesion-associated complexes to Rho-kinase inhibition. Conclusions/Significance Multicolor compositional imaging resolves “molecular signatures” characteristic to focal-adhesions and related structures, as well as sub-domains within these adhesion sites. This analysis enhances the spatial information with additional “contents-resolved” dimensions. We propose that compositional imaging can serve as a powerful tool for studying complex multi-molecular assemblies in cells and for mapping their distribution at sub-micron resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2030885701,"Background The study and comparison of protein-protein interfaces is essential for the understanding of the mechanisms of interaction between proteins. While there are many methods for comparing protein structures and protein binding sites, so far no methods have been reported for comparing the geometry of non-covalent interactions occurring at protein-protein interfaces. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we present a method for aligning non-covalent interactions between different protein-protein interfaces. The method aligns the vector representations of van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds based on their geometry. The method has been applied to a dataset which comprises a variety of protein-protein interfaces. The alignments are consistent to a large extent with the results obtained using two other complementary approaches. In addition, we apply the method to three examples of protein mimicry. The method successfully aligns respective interfaces and allows for recognizing conserved interface regions. Conclusions/Significance The Galinter method has been validated in the comparison of interfaces in which homologous subunits are involved, including cases of mimicry. The method is also applicable to comparing interfaces involving non-peptidic compounds. Galinter assists users in identifying local interface regions with similar patterns of non-covalent interactions. This is particularly relevant to the investigation of the molecular basis of interaction mimicry."
https://openalex.org/W2006579465,"The high affinity IgE receptor, Fc epsilonRI, plays a key role in the immunological pathways involved in allergic asthma. Previously we have demonstrated that human neutrophils isolated from allergic asthmatics express a functional Fc epsilonRI, and therefore it was of importance to examine the factors regulating its expression. In this study, we found that neutrophils from allergic asthmatics showed increased expression of Fc epsilonRI-alpha chain surface protein, total protein and mRNA compared with those from allergic non asthmatics and healthy donors (p<0.001). Interestingly, in neutrophils isolated from allergic asthmatics, Fc epsilonRI-alpha chain surface protein and mRNA expression were significantly greater during the pollen season than outside the pollen season (n = 9, P = 0.001), an effect which was not observed either in the allergic non asthmatic group or the healthy donors (p>0.05). Allergen exposure did not affect other surface markers of neutrophils such as CD16/Fc gammaRIII or IL-17R. In contrast to stimulation with IgE, neutrophils incubated with TH2 cytokines IL-9, GM-CSF, and IL-4, showed enhanced Fc epsilonRI-alpha chain surface expression. In conclusion, these results suggest that enhanced Fc epsilonRI expression in human neutrophils from allergic asthmatics during the pollen season can make them more susceptible to the biological effects of IgE, providing a possible new mechanism by which neutrophils contribute to allergic asthma."
https://openalex.org/W1971166208,"Development and maintenance of the identity of tissues is of central importance for multicellular organisms. Based on gene expression profiles, it is possible to divide genes in housekeeping genes and those whose expression is preferential in one or a few tissues and which provide specialized functions that have a strong effect on the physiology of the whole organism.We have surveyed the gene expression in 78 normal human tissues integrating publicly available microarray gene expression data. A total amount of 1601 genes were identified as selectively expressed in one or more tissues. The tissue-selective genes covered a wide range of cellular and molecular functions, and could be linked to 361 human diseases with Mendelian inheritance. Based on the gene expression profiles, we were able to form a network of tissues reflecting their functional relatedness and, to certain extent, their development. Using co-citation driven gene network technique and promoter analysis, we predicted a transcriptional module where the co-operation of the transcription factors E2F and NF-kappaB can possibly regulate a number of genes involved in the neurogenesis that takes place in the adult hippocampus.Here we propose that integration of gene expression data from Affymetrix GeneChip experiments is possible through re-annotation and commonly used pre-processing methods. We suggest that some functional aspects of the tissues can be explained by the co-operation of multiple transcription factors that regulate the expression of selected groups of genes."
https://openalex.org/W1966969061,"One of the most interesting questions in biology is whether certain pathways have been favored during evolution, and if so, what properties could cause such a preference. Due to the lack of experimental evidence, whether select gene families have been preferentially retained over time after duplication in metazoan organisms remains unclear. Here, by syntenic mapping of nonchemosensory G protein-coupled receptor genes (nGPCRs which represent half the receptome for transmembrane signaling) in the vertebrate genomes, we found that, as opposed to the 8-15% retention rate for whole genome duplication (WGD)-derived gene duplicates in the entire genome of pufferfish, greater than 27.8% of WGD-derived nGPCRs which interact with a nonpeptide ligand were retained after WGD in pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis. In addition, we show that concurrent duplication of cognate ligand genes by WGD could impose selection of nGPCRs that interact with a polypeptide ligand. Against less than 2.25% probability for parallel retention of a pair of WGD-derived ligands and a pair of cognate receptor duplicates, we found a more than 8.9% retention of WGD-derived ligand-nGPCR pairs--threefold greater than one would surmise. These results demonstrate that gene retention is not uniform after WGD in vertebrates, and suggest a Darwinian selection of GPCR-mediated intercellular communication in metazoan organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2038310606,"The RecX protein of Escherichia coli inhibits the extension of RecA protein filaments on DNA, presumably by binding to and blocking the growing filament end. The direct binding of RecX protein to single-stranded DNA is weak, and previous reports suggested that direct binding to DNA did not explain the effects of RecX. We now demonstrate that elevated concentrations of SSB greatly moderate the effects of RecX protein. High concentrations of the yeast RPA protein have the same effect, suggesting that the effect is not species-specific or even specific to bacterial SSB proteins. A direct SSB-RecX interaction is thus unlikely. We suggest that SSB is blocking access to single-stranded DNA. The evident competition between RecX and SSB implies that the mechanism of RecX action may involve RecX binding to both RecA protein and to DNA. We speculate that the interaction of RecX protein and RecA may enable an enhanced DNA binding by RecX protein. The effects of SSB are increased if the SSB C terminus is removed."

Epidemiological evidence has suggested that HDL2 is more atheroprotective; however, currently there is no direct experimental evidence to support this postulate. The amino acid sequence of apoA-I is a primary determinant of HDL subclass formation. The majority of the α-helical repeats in human apoA-I are proline-punctuated. A notable exception is the boundary between helices 7 and 8, which is located in the transitional segment between the stable N-terminal domain and the C-terminal hydrophobic domain. In this study we ask whether the substitution of a proline-containing sequence (PCS) separating other helices in human apoA-I for the non-proline-containing sequence (NPCS) between helices 7 and 8 (residues 184–190) influences HDL subclass association. The human apoA-I mutant with PCS2 replacing NPCS preferentially bound to HDL2. In contrast, the mutant where PCS3 replaced NPCS preferentially associated with HDL3. Thus, the specific amino acid sequence between helices 7 and 8 influences HDL subclass association. The wild-type and mutant proteins exhibited similar physicochemical properties except that the two mutants displayed greater lipid-associated stability versus wild-type human apoA-I. These results focus new attention on the influence of the boundary between helices 7 and 8 on the properties of apoA-I.

Most species, including mice, generate monodisperse HDL particles, whereas primates and humans make distinct HDL subclasses, the two major subclasses being HDL2 and HDL3 (14Reschly E.J.

HDL2 are larger and more buoyant and have a higher apoA-I:apoA-II ratio than HDL3. In addition, apoE is found almost exclusively on HDL2. The molecular and physiological basis for these HDL subclasses in humans are unknown; however, some distinct functional capacities of these HDL subclasses have been identified (15Mowri H.O. Patsch W.

The primary structure of apoA-I consists of a series of 11- or 22-amino acid repeats capable of forming amphipathic α-helices that can form helix bundles in the lipid-free state (21Frank P.G. Marcel Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 853-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ajees A. Anantharamaiah G.M. Mishra V.K. Hussain M.M. Murthy M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2126-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Several structure/function relationships have been identified for specific helical repeats within human apoA-I. Helices 1, 9, and 10 are essential for initial lipid binding (23Davidson W.S. Hazlett T. Mantulin W.W. Jonas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13605-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24Saito H. Katz-Lund S. Phillips M.C. Prog.

The seven proline residues in human apoA-I are located between the helical repeats. The sequences between putative helices 2 and 3 and putative helices 7 and 8 in human apoA-I lack proline residues. Several nonprimate species contain a proline residue in the latter position (21Frank P.G. Marcel Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 853-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two crystal structures of lipid-free human apoA-I have been reported. The Δ1–43 crystal structure forms a horseshoe shape, with the proline-containing sequences (PCS) between helices adopting an average angle of 39.9° (25Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In contrast, the non-proline-containing sequence (NPCS) between putative helices 7 and 8 adopts a 12–18° angle. The crystal structure of the whole protein forms a four-helix bundle N-terminal domain (NTD) and smaller C-terminal domain (CTD) (22Ajees A. Anantharamaiah G.M. Mishra V.K. Hussain M.M. Murthy M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2126-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Recent experimental evidence suggests that the NTD of lipid-free apoA-I forms a stable four-helix bundle, and the CTD forms a hydrophobic random coil (24Saito H. Katz-Lund S. Phillips M.C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 350-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The transition between the NTD and CTD involves the NPCS between putative helices 7 and 8.

In in vitro binding assays mouse apoA-I associates preferentially with HDL2, whereas the human protein associates equally well with HDL2 and HDL3 (14Reschly E.J. Sorci-Thomas M.G. Davidson W.S. Meredith S.C. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9645-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The affinities for the HDL subclasses parallel the size and density of the HDL found in human and mouse plasma. When the human sequence from residues 166–209 (putative helices 7 and 8) were substituted for the homologous sequence in murine apoA-I, a chimeric molecule was produced that resembled human apoA-I in its lipoprotein association properties. Inspection of the human and mouse sequences between putative helices 7 and 8 shows that in contrast to the human protein, this region in the mouse protein contains a proline residue. In this study, we focused on the potential role of proline residues in this region of human apoA-I on HDL subclass association. The lipidation of apoA-I is suggested to occur in two steps (24Saito H. Katz-Lund S. Phillips M.C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 350-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). apoA-I initially binds to a lipid surface through the random coil in the CTD; this is accompanied by an increase in α-helicity in the CTD (24Saito H. Katz-Lund S. Phillips M.C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 350-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 31Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Deridder E. Holvoet P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20974-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the helix bundle of the NTD undergoes a conformational change, converting hydrophobic helix-helix interactions to helix-lipid interactions. In this step, the extra helicity in the NTD appears to come from residues 123–142, as well as residues 1–43 (24Saito H. Katz-Lund S. Phillips M.C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 350-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This supports the contention that the majority of apoA-I is α-helical in structure when lipid-associated. This includes the region of the protein where we have focused our attention, residues 184–190. We hypothesize that it is the segment between putative helices 7 and 8 that contributes to the propensity of the apoprotein to associate with the different HDL subclasses each having a different radius of curvature. This is based upon the following points. The transition between the α-helical NTD and the random coiled CTD spans putative helices 7 and 8 (24Saito H. Katz-Lund S. Phillips M.C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 350-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Second, the mouse sequence between these putative helices contains a proline, whereas this is not the case for the human sequence, which instead contains an alanine residue at this position (21Frank P.G. Marcel Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 853-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, apoA-I encompasses spherical HDL with the hydrophobic face associated with lipid, expressing a concavity toward the lipid surface. We believe that the concave curvature of the protein is facilitated by the PCS. This hypothesis is further supported by Lazar et al. (32Lazar K.L. Miller-Auer H. Getz G.S. Orgel J.P. Meredith S.C. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12681-12689Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) where specific human PCS (particularly those between helices 3/4, 4/5, and 9/10) when placed between an 18-mer canonical apoA-I mimetic sequence drive the structure of the protein. Here we ask whether the nature of the sequence between putative helices 7 and 8 influences the ability of human apoA-I to associate with HDL2 or HDL3. Elements Common to All Recombinant apoA-I cDNAs—The restriction enzymes, Vent polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits and Pfu DNA polymerase were from Stratagene. The oligonucleotide primers were made by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. The pET28 vector from Novagen was used for bacterial expression of apoA-I. Generation of Recombinant apoA-I—The wild-type human apoA-I cDNA was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET28c as described previously (14Reschly E.J. Sorci-Thomas M.G. Davidson W.S. Meredith S.C. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9645-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein contains a poly-His sequence and a T7 tag at the N terminus of the protein. The PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was used to replace the natural NPCS (NGGARLA) between putative helices 7 and 8 of human apoA-I (residues 184–190) with the PCS present between other helices of the human protein (i.e. PCS1-QLGPVTQ, residues 63–69; PCS2-KVQPYLD, residues 96–102; PCS3-KVEPLRA, residues 118–124; PCS4-KLSPLGE, residues 140–146; PCS5-HLAPYSD, residues 162–168; PCS6-KAKPALE, residues 206–212; and PCS7-GLLPVLE, residues 217–224). Each plasmid was transformed into protease-minus BL21(DE3)pLys Escherichia coli strain (Novagen) and the protein purification was carried out as described earlier (14Reschly E.J. Sorci-Thomas M.G.

The concentration of recombinant human apoA-I was determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Cross-linking Experiments—Lipid-free or lipid-bound wild-type/mutant apoA-I (1 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 50 mm NaCl at pH 7.2 were incubated for 30 min with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce; final concentration, 0.5 mm). The reaction mixture was quenched by adding 1 m Tris-HCl and 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then loaded on a 6–12% Tricine/PAGE gel. The populations of different oligomers were estimated using the band intensities of the oligomers as quantified using the software of Kodak Gel Logic 100 imaging system (33Ren X. Zhao L. Sivashanmugam A. Miao Y. Korando L. Yang Z. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Brouillette C.G. Jerome W.G. Wang J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14907-14919Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD measurements of lipid-free and lipid-bound wild-type/mutant apoA-I were carried out on an Aviv model 62DS CD spectrometer (Aviv Instruments, Inc., Lakewood NJ) with a variable temperature capability under computer control within ±0.2 °C. Lyophilized protein samples were suspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 50 mm NaCl at pH 7.2 and were adjusted to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml using the same buffer. The measurements were made at room temperature using a 0.1-cm quartz cell. Five scans between 200 and 250 nm were acquired and averaged. A baseline scan was subtracted to produce the final average scan. The percentage of α-helix content was calculated from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm using the mean residue weight for each of the apoA-I proteins (33Ren X. Zhao L. Sivashanmugam A. Miao Y.

Preparation and Characterization of apoA-I:rHDL Particles—The rHDL particles were prepared using the sodium cholate dialysis method with phosphatidylcholine (POPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids), wild-type/mutant apoA-I, and sodium cholate in a molar ratio of 80:1:108 (33Ren X. Zhao L. Sivashanmugam A. Miao Y. Korando L. Yang Z. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Brouillette C.G. Jerome W.G. Wang J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14907-14919Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). POPC was dissolved in CHCl3, dried under nitrogen, and then resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. After being vortexed thoroughly, sodium cholate was added into the mixture followed by vortexing for another 3 min. The solution was incubated at 37 °C and vortexed every 15 min until completely clear. Human apoA-I protein was added, and the protein/lipid mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Sodium cholate was removed by the Bio-bead method (33Ren X. Zhao L. Sivashanmugam A. Miao Y. Korando L. Yang Z. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Brouillette C.G. Jerome W.G. Wang J.

Lipid-associated (Isothermal) Guanidine HCl Denaturation Studies—Guanidine HCl denaturation was performed as described (33Ren X. Zhao L. Sivashanmugam A. Miao Y. Korando L. Yang Z. Reardon C.A.

DMPC (Lipid Binding) Clearance Assay—Ten milligrams of DMPC (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.) were dissolved in a mixture of chloroform and methanol (3:1 v/v), dried using N2, and placed under vacuum for at least 10 h. 1 ml of prewarmed buffer was added (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA) for a final lipid concentration of 10 mg/ml and vortexed several times (30 s each). Using a 200-nm filter, unilamellar vesicles (∼200 nm in diameter) were prepared by extrusion. The protein-induced transformation of DMPC vesicles into protein/DMPC discoidal complexes were monitored as a function of time (33Ren X. Zhao L. Sivashanmugam A. Miao Y. Korando L. Yang Z. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Brouillette C.G. Jerome W.G. Wang J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14907-14919Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two different ratios of apoA-I and DMPC (1:1 and 1:2.5, w/w) were used in this assay. apoA-I/DMPC vesicles in buffer were added into a 1-ml thermostat cuvette and mixed for 5–10 s at 24 °C. The clearance of solution was monitored using a PerkinElmer spectrophotometer (model Lambda 3B) at 490 nm. All of the solutions were preincubated at 24 °C before being used in the reaction. Isolation of Human HDL2 and HDL3—HDL2 (ρ = 1.063–1.098 g/ml) and HDL3 (ρ = 1.13–1.21 g/ml) were isolated from human plasma obtained from female donors by sequential flotation as described (14Reschly E.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9645-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). apoA-I Quantitation by Immunoturbidometry—The endogenous apoA-I in the isolated HDL was determined by immunoturbidometry using kits from Roche Applied Science (14Reschly E.J.

The human apoA-I standards were purchased from Sigma or Northwest Lipid Laboratory (Seattle, WA). In Vitro Association of Recombinant Human apoA-I with Isolated Human HDL—The recombinant human apoA-I proteins were incubated with different proportions of HDL2 and HDL3 (i.e. 1:1, 2:1 or 1:2) according to their endogenous apoA-I content. In a typical 545-μl assay, 10 μg of wild-type/mutant recombinant human apoA-I was incubated with an HDL preparation containing 625 μg of total endogenous apoA-I for 30 min at 4 °C. Following incubation, the final volume of the assay mixture was adjusted to 2.0 ml with Tris-sodium chloride-EDTA (TSE) buffer (10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 0.15 mm sodium azide), pH 7.4, and subjected to a 10–20% equilibrium density gradient separation (14Reschly E.J. Sorci-Thomas M.G. Davidson W.S. Meredith S.C. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9645-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 0.4-ml fractions were collected using an ISCO gradient collector. The gradient fractions corresponding to HDL2 and HDL3 were determined from the A280 tracings. To detect the recombinant and endogenous apoA-I in these fractions, alternate fractions were electrophoresed on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels, proteins transferred to Immobilon-P, and immunodecorated with mouse monoclonal anti-T7 antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5000 dilution; Novagen) to detect recombinant apoA-I or with rabbit anti-huA-I antibodies (1:25000 dilution)/goat anti-rabbit-IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) for endogenous and recombinant huA-I detection. The immunodecorated proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences/Molecular Dynamics). The protein bands were quantitated by Alpha-Imager (ImageQuant, Genomic Solutions Inc). To compare data between experiments the recombinant apoA-I distributions were normalized to the HDL2:HDL3 proportions by dividing them by the corresponding endogenous apoA-I distributions. Endogenous apoA-I is an appropriate surrogate for starting HDL proportions. Concentration-dependent Binding of Recombinant apoA-I to HDL Subclasses—To determine the binding curves of wild-type/mutant human apoA-I proteins for HDL subclasses, increasing amounts of recombinant apoA-I (1.25–51 μg) were added to isolated HDL2 or HDL3 (total protein, 200 μg) in 545 μl of TSE buffer. The reaction was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. An aliquot from each assay was electrophoresed on 0.7% agarose gels to separate HDL bound from unbound protein. Following transfer to Immobilon-P, specifically probing with the mouse monoclonal anti-T7 antibody, as described above, recombinant human apoA-I bound to HDL and unbound were calculated and used to determine the Kd of association. The blots were also immunoblotted for apoE and apoA-IV to assess remodeling of the HDL during the incubation. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated little remodeling at the concentrations of HDL and recombinant proteins used in these studies. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the means ± S.D. Group differences were tested by analysis of variance and Student's t tests. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. Because we previously showed that apoA-I recombinant protein HDL subclass association in vitro parallels HDL generation in vivo (14Reschly E.J. Sorci-Thomas M.G. Davidson W.S. Meredith S.C. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9645-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), this study is designed to examine the capacity of the sequence between putative helices 7 and 8 of human apoA-I to influence its ability to associate with human HDL subclasses. The mutant proteins are designated by the specific PCS replacing the NPCS between residues 184 and 190. Thus, when the PCS between helices 3 and 4 (i.e. PCS2) is inserted in place of the NPCS at residues 184–190 of human apoA-I, the mutant is designated NPCS→ PCS2, as illustrated in Fig. 1. HDL Preferential Association Assay—Our strategy involves the synthesis of recombinant apoA-I constructs each containing N-terminal tags consisting of a His tag for purification and a T7 tag to specifically detect the recombinant proteins after associating with human HDL. We have previously shown by comparing recombinant wild-type apoA-I (T7-HuA-I) protein with purified plasma apoA-I that the presence of the N-terminal tag did not significantly affect the properties of the protein (14Reschly E.J. Sorci-Thomas M.G. Davidson W.S. Meredith S.C. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9645-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins displayed the expected molecular weights determined by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). From densitometric scanning of the gel, the purity of the recombinant proteins was ≥95%. We examined the ability of the various recombinant proteins to associate with mature HDL subclasses. In this association assay, lipid-free recombinant apoA-I was incubated with different ratios of human HDL2 and HDL3 (i.e. 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1) at an endogenous to recombinant apoA-I weight ratio of 62.5:1. At this ratio the added apoA-I “tags” the HDL without significantly altering the HDL size or density. Assuming two to four molecules of apoA-I per HDL, there are about 20 HDL particles (HDL2 + HDL3) per recombinant apoA-I molecule in the association assays. With this excess of HDL, the recombinant apoA-I binds to the HDL subclass for which it has the highest affinity. The HDL subclasses after incubation with the recombinant apoA-I were separated on NaBr equilibrium density gradients, and the fractions were analyzed for the presence of endogenous apoA-I and recombinant proteins by immunoblotting. To compare data among experiments, the recombinant apoA-I distributions (anti-T7 tag) were normalized to the starting HDL2:HDL3 proportions by dividing the recombinant apoA-I distributions by the corresponding endogenous apoA-I distribution. We found that endogenous apoA-I is an appropriate surrogate for starting HDL subclass proportions, as demonstrated by the similar HDL subclass ratio calculated from A280 tracings and from the densitometric scanning of the Western blot for endogenous apoA-I. T7-HuA-I distributed to HDL subclasses in a pattern that followed closely that of endogenous apoA-I (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W1987413913,"Background The stimulation to differentiate into specific cell types for somatic stem cells is largely due to a series of internal and external signals coming from the microenvironment that surrounds the stem cell. Even though intensive research has been made, the basic mechanisms of plasticity and/or the molecules regulating stem cells proliferation and differentiation are not completely determined. Potential answers concerning the problems could be derived from the studies of stem cells in culture. Methodology/Principle Findings We combine a new procedure (using the matrigel biopolymer supplemented with a selected cytokine/growth factor) with classic techniques such as light, confocal and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and cell culture, to perform an analysis on stem cells involved in the leech (Hirudo medicinalis) repair tissues. The leech has a relative anatomical simplicity and is a reliable model for studying a variety of basic events, such as tissue repair, which has a striking similarity with vertebrate responses. Our data demonstrate that the injection of an appropriate combination of the matrigel biopolymer supplemented with a selected cytokine/growth factor in the leech Hirudo medicinalis is a remarkably effective tool for isolating a specific cell population in vivo. A comparative analysis of biopolymer in vivo sorted stem cells indicates that VEGF recruited cells of a hematopoietic/endothelial phenotype whereas MCP-1/CCL2 isolated cells that were of an early myeloid lineage. Conclusion Our paper describes, for the first time, a method allowing not only the isolation of a specific cell population in relation to the cytokine utilized but also the possibility to culture a precise cell type whose isolation is otherwise quite difficult. This approach could be broadly applied to isolate stem cells of diverse origins based on the recruitment stimuli employed."
https://openalex.org/W2067054157,"The Gag polyproteins of gammaretroviruses contain a conserved p12 domain between MA and CA that plays critical roles in virus assembly, reverse transcription and nuclear integration. Here we show using nuclear magnetic resonance, that p12 is unstructured in a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) Gag fragment that includes the N-terminal domain of CA (p12-CA(N)). Furthermore, no long range interactions were observed between the domains, as has been previously predicted. Flexibility appears to be a common feature of Gag ""late"" domains required for virus release during budding. Residues near the N-terminus of CA(N) that form a beta-hairpin in the mature CA protein are unfolded in p12-CA(N), consistent with proposals that hairpin formation helps trigger capsid assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2023531182,"The effect of Bcl-2 on oncogenesis is complex and expression may either delay or accelerate oncogenesis. The pro-oncogenic activity is attributed to its well characterized anti-apoptotic function while the anti-oncogenic function has been attributed to its inhibition of cellular proliferation. Recent studies demonstrate that p27 may mediate the effects of Bcl-2 on cellular proliferation. We hypothesized that p27 may suppress tumor formation by Bcl-2 family members. To test this hypothesis, cell cycle inhibition and lymphoma development were examined in Lck-Bcl-2 and Lck-Bax38/1 transgenic mice deficient in p27. Strikingly, p27 deficiency synergistically cooperates with Bcl-2 to increase T cell hyperplasia and development of spontaneous T cell lymphomas. Within 1 year, >90% of these mice had developed thymic T cell lymphomas. This high penetrance contrasts with a one year incidence of <5% of thymic lymphoma in Lck-Bcl-2 or p27 −/− mice alone. In contrast, p27 deficiency had no effect on tumor formation in Lck-Bax38/1 transgenic mice, another model of T cell lymphoma. Histologically the lymphomas in p27 −/− Lck-Bcl-2 mice are lymphoblastic and frequently involve multiple organs suggesting an aggressive phenotype. Interestingly, in mature splenic T cells, Bcl-2 largely retains its anti-proliferative function even in the absence of p27. T cells from p27 −/− Lck-Bcl-2 mice show delayed kinetics of CDK2 Thr-160 phosphorylation. This delay is associated with a delay in the up regulation of both Cyclin D2 and D3. These data demonstrate a complex relationship between the Bcl-2 family, cellular proliferation, and oncogenesis and demonstrate that p27 up-regulation is not singularly important in the proliferative delay observed in T cells expressing Bcl-2 family members. Nonetheless, the results indicate that p27 is a critical tumor suppressor in the context of Bcl-2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1975942159,"Background It has been shown that the clinical state of one patient can be represented by known measured variables of interest, each of which then form the element of a fuzzy set as point in the unit hypercube. We hypothesized that precise comparison of a single patient with the average patient of a large double blind controlled randomized study is possible using fuzzy theory. Methods/Principle Findings The sets as points unit hypercube geometry allows fuzzy subsethood to define in measures of fuzzy cardinality different conditions, similarity and comparison between fuzzy sets. A fuzzy measure of prediction is defined from fuzzy measures of similarity and comparison. It is a measure of the degree to which fuzzy set A is similar to fuzzy set B when different conditions are taken into account and removed from the comparison. When represented as a fuzzy set as point in the unit hypercube, a clinical patient can be compared to an average patient of a large group study in a precise manner. This comparison is expressed by the fuzzy prediction measure. This measure in itself is not a probability. Once thus precisely matched to the average patient of a large group study, risk reduction is calculated by multiplying the measured similarity of the clinical patient to the risk of the average trial patient. Conclusion/Significance Otherwise not precisely translatable to the single case, the result of group statistics can be applied to the single case through the use of fuzzy subsethood and measured in fuzzy cardinality. This measure is an alternative to a Bayesian or other probability based statistical approach."
https://openalex.org/W2110715446,"Recent studies have suggested that some neural computational mechanisms are based on the fine temporal structure of spiking activity. However, less effort has been devoted to investigating the evolutionary aspects of such mechanisms. In this paper we explore the issue of temporal neural computation from an evolutionary point of view, using a genetic simulation of the evolutionary development of neural systems. We evolve neural systems in an environment with selective pressure based on mate finding, and examine the temporal aspects of the evolved systems. In repeating evolutionary sessions, there was a significant increase during evolution in the mutual information between the evolved agent's temporal neural representation and the external environment. In ten different simulated evolutionary sessions, there was an increased effect of time -related neural ablations on the agents' fitness. These results suggest that in some fitness landscapes the emergence of temporal elements in neural computation is almost inevitable. Future research using similar evolutionary simulations may shed new light on various biological mechanisms."
