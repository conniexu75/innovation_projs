https://openalex.org/W2746007985,"A two-dimensional phononic quadrupole topological insulator is demonstrated experimentally using mechanical metamaterials, which has both the one-dimensional edge states and the zero-dimensional corner states predicted by theory. The properties of many materials with topological band structures can be understood in terms of a quantization of the electric polarization. By considering a quantization of higher-order polarizations, a new class of higher-order topological insulators has recently been predicted. Marc Serra-Garcia et al. use a mechanical metamaterial to demonstrate such a system experimentally: a two-dimensional phononic quadrupole topological insulator, which has both one-dimensional states at the edges as well as zero-dimensional states at the corners. As these topological corner states are two dimensions lower than the bulk, they could provide a route to engineering one-dimensional channels along the edges of three-dimensional systems. The modern theory of charge polarization in solids1,2 is based on a generalization of Berry’s phase3. The possibility of the quantization of this phase4,5 arising from parallel transport in momentum space is essential to our understanding of systems with topological band structures6,7,8,9,10. Although based on the concept of charge polarization, this same theory can also be used to characterize the Bloch bands of neutral bosonic systems such as photonic11 or phononic crystals12,13. The theory of this quantized polarization has recently been extended from the dipole moment to higher multipole moments14. In particular, a two-dimensional quantized quadrupole insulator is predicted to have gapped yet topological one-dimensional edge modes, which stabilize zero-dimensional in-gap corner states14. However, such a state of matter has not previously been observed experimentally. Here we report measurements of a phononic quadrupole topological insulator. We experimentally characterize the bulk, edge and corner physics of a mechanical metamaterial (a material with tailored mechanical properties) and find the predicted gapped edge and in-gap corner states. We corroborate our findings by comparing the mechanical properties of a topologically non-trivial system to samples in other phases that are predicted by the quadrupole theory. These topological corner states are an important stepping stone to the experimental realization of topologically protected wave guides12,15 in higher dimensions, and thereby open up a new path for the design of metamaterials16,17."

Large-scale resequencing has been undertaken to discover allelic variants in rice, but much of the information for genetic variation is often lost by direct mapping of short sequence reads onto the O. sativa japonica Nipponbare reference genome. Here we constructed a pan-genome dataset of the O. sativa-O. rufipogon species complex through deep sequencing and de novo assembly of 66 divergent accessions. Intergenomic comparisons identified 23 million sequence variants in the rice genome. This catalog of sequence variations includes many known quantitative trait nucleotides and will be helpful in pinpointing new causal variants that underlie complex traits. In particular, we systemically investigated the whole set of coding genes using this pan-genome data, which revealed extensive presence and absence of variation among rice accessions. This pan-genome resource will further promote evolutionary and functional studies in rice."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease that has an extremely poor prognosis, with a median survival of <1 year and a 5-year overall survival rate of <9% (National Cancer InstituteNational Cancer Institute. Cancer Stat Facts: Pancreas Cancer. https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html.Google Scholar). Whereas PDACs are generally chemo-resistant, a fraction of patients benefit from current therapeutics, underscoring the importance of understanding inter-patient tumor heterogeneity in depth and stratifying PDACs to predict clinical behaviors. Recent gene-expression-based classification identified 2 major prognosis-predicting molecular subtypes in PDAC, namely the classical and quasi-mesenchymal (QM) subtypes (Bailey et al., 2016Bailey P.

The classical subtype was characterized by differentiated duct cell marker expression and favorable prognosis, whereas the QM subtype was characterized by aggressive clinical behavior and by gene silencing of definitive endoderm specification genes, including GATA6, FOXA2, and HNF4A. Similar QM-like subtypes regulated by GATA6 expression were also reported as squamous (Bailey et al., 2016Bailey P. Chang D.K. Nones K. Johns A.L. Patch A.M. Gingras M.C. Miller D.K. Christ A.N.

Despite the robust identification of gene expression subtypes, whether these subtypes reflect genetically distinct cell-of-origin or tumor-progression statuses has remained elusive, owing to a paucity of functional assay systems for human PDAC. Functional analyses of PDAC have mainly relied on genetically engineered mice, cell lines, and patient-derived tumor xenograft models. The genetic tractability of mouse models and cell lines has contributed to the understanding of pancreas tumorigenesis, yet its relevance to the clinical traits of human PDAC, including histological and gene expression subtypes, remains unknown (Hwang et al., 2016Hwang C.I.

Xenograft models can be efficiently generated from clinical samples with preserved histological and molecular subtypes, whereas the labor-intensive and genetically intractable natures of such models have limited large-scale analyses and prospective genetic approaches for PDAC. The organoid culture system has recently emerged as a technology that can propagate epithelial tissues as 3D structures using artificial stem cell niche environments (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (4154) Google Scholar). A defined niche factor combination of R-spondin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10), and Noggin (a BMP4 inhibitor) promoted the expansion of normal mouse pancreatic duct cells (Huch et al., 2013Huch M. Bonfanti P. Boj S.F. Sato T. Loomans C.J. van de Wetering M. Sojoodi M. Li V.S. Schuijers J.

Hwang C.I. Baker L.A. Chio I.I. Engle D.D. Corbo V. Jager M. Ponz-Sarvise M. Tiriac H.

To date, a dozen lines of PDAC organoids have been generated in which the preservation of histological traits and genetic-mutation profiles of the parental tumors were confirmed. Despite these advances, large-scale transcriptome analysis of human PDAC organoids has not been conducted, posing a bottleneck in connecting biological behavior with gene expression subtypes (Boj et al., 2015Boj S.F. Hwang C.I. Baker L.A. Chio I.I. Engle D.D. Corbo V. Jager M. Ponz-Sarvise M. Tiriac H.

Med. 2015; 21: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In this study, by refining organoid culture conditions, we established 39 lines of PDAC organoids and performed comprehensive molecular characterization, which illuminated different modes of Wnt/R-spondin niche dependency in association with gene expression subtypes. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated engineering of pancreas organoids demonstrated the stepwise tumorigenesis of PDAC with progressive acquisition of niche independency. Using surgical, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and ascites specimens, we established organoids from pancreatic tumors as well as normal organoids when adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were available (Figure 1A). Using previously published culture conditions (Huch et al., 2013Huch M. Bonfanti P. Boj S.F. Sato T. Loomans C.J. van de Wetering M. Sojoodi M. Li V.S. Schuijers J. Gracanin A. et al.Unlimited in vitro expansion of adult bi-potent pancreas progenitors through the Lgr5/R-spondin axis.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 2708-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), normal pancreas duct organoids ceased proliferation within 2 or 3 months (Boj et al., 2015Boj S.F. Hwang C.I. Baker L.A. Chio I.I. Engle D.D. Corbo V. Jager M. Ponz-Sarvise M. Tiriac H. Spector M.S. et al.Organoid models of human and mouse ductal pancreatic cancer.Cell. 2015; 160: 324-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). We found that the replacement of serum-stabilized Wnt3A-conditioned medium with serum-free Afamin-stabilized Wnt3A (Mihara et al., 2016Mihara E. Hirai H. Yamamoto H. Tamura-Kawakami K. Matano M. Kikuchi A. Sato T. Takagi J. Active and water-soluble form of lipidated Wnt protein is maintained by a serum glycoprotein afamin/α-albumin.eLife. 2016; 5: e11621Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) enabled stable culture for over 8 months. Notably, the addition of serum triggered senescence, suggesting that serum in standard Wnt3A-conditioned medium is detrimental for the long-term maintenance of human pancreas organoids (Figure S1A). Using this culture protocol, we established a pancreatic tumor organoid library (PTOL) consisting of 49 organoid lines generated from patient-derived pancreatic tumors (Table S1). In our initial experiments, we often observed the outgrowth of normal pancreas organoids from PDAC specimens. The selective growth of “contaminating” normal organoids has been previously reported during the establishment of PDAC and prostate cancer organoids (Boj et al., 2015Boj S.F. Hwang C.I. Baker L.A. Chio I.I. Engle D.D. Corbo V. Jager M. Ponz-Sarvise M. Tiriac H. Spector M.S. et al.Organoid models of human and mouse ductal pancreatic cancer.Cell. 2015; 160: 324-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar, Gao et al., 2014Gao D. Vela I. Sboner A. Iaquinta P.J. Karthaus W.R. Gopalan A. Dowling C. Wanjala J.N. Undvall E.A. Arora V.K. et al.Organoid cultures derived from patients with advanced prostate cancer.Cell. 2014; 159: 176-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Considering the high prevalence of KRAS mutations that occur among PDACs, the organoids were first placed in an EGF-depleted condition to enrich the KRAS mutant organoids (Figure 1B). In contrast to the standard Wnt-conditioned medium that could activate EGFR and other cognate receptors by serum-derived growth factors (Wang et al., 2013Wang M. Maier P. Wenz F. Giordano F.A. Herskind C. Mitogenic signalling in the absence of epidermal growth factor receptor activation in a human glioblastoma cell line.J. Neurooncol. 2013; 115: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), EGF removal from the serum-free medium efficiently selected KRAS mutant organoids. The efficient enrichment of PDAC organoids can be readily visualized when spherical PDAC organoids grew along with normal cystic organoids; after EGF-based selection, KRAS mutant spherical PDAC organoids dominated whereas cystic organoids with wild-type KRAS disappeared (Figures 1C, S1B, and S1C). KRAS mutant spherical organoids, but not normal cystic organoids, displayed phospho-ERK expression in the absence of EGF, confirming the ligand-independent activation of Ras signaling in PDAC organoids (Figure S1D). Organoids that were susceptible to EGF removal were alternatively treated with Nutlin3 (an MDM2 inhibitor) or with Noggin removal/BMP4 to select potentially existing TP53 or SMAD4 mutant organoids, respectively (Figure 1B). Together with the aforementioned EGF-based selection, the niche-based selection was used to diagnose 39 out of 49 organoids in the PTOL as PDAC organoids. The remaining 10 organoids exhibited strict niche dependencies indistinguishable from those of normal pancreas organoids and were referred to as normal-like (NL) organoids. To determine the accuracy of niche-factor-based diagnosis, we analyzed the genetic status of the established organoids using whole-exome sequencing and comparative genomic-hybridization microarray analyses. Consistent with previous large-scale deep-sequencing analyses (Waddell et al., 2015Waddell N. Pajic M. Patch A.M. Chang D.K. Kassahn K.S. Bailey P. Johns A.L. Miller D. Nones K. Quek K. et al.Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome InitiativeWhole genomes redefine the mutational landscape of pancreatic cancer.Nature. 2015; 518: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar), PDAC organoids harbored common driver-gene alterations at the expected frequencies: KRAS (36/38); CDKN2A (31/38); TP53 (29/38); and SMAD4 (14/38; Table S2). GNAS hotspot mutations (GNASR201H) were detected in two organoid lines (2/49), one of which was derived from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Of note, no authenticated IPMN cell line with a GNAS mutation has been derived to date (Furukawa et al., 2011Furukawa T. Kuboki Y. Tanji E. Yoshida S. Hatori T. Yamamoto M. Shibata N. Shimizu K. Kamatani N. Shiratori K. Whole-exome sequencing uncovers frequent GNAS mutations in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas.Sci. Rep. 2011; 1: 161Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We did not detect recurrent driver-gene mutations in normal-like organoids, corroborating the accurate selection of PDAC organoids (Figure 1D). Whereas detailed copy number analyses of PDACs have been hampered by the low tumor content of clinical PDAC samples (Shain et al., 2012Shain A.H. Giacomini C.P. Matsukuma K. Karikari C.A. Bashyam M.D. Hidalgo M. Maitra A. Pollack J.R. Convergent structural alterations define SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeler as a central tumor suppressive complex in pancreatic cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E252-E259Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, Witkiewicz et al., 2015Witkiewicz A.K. McMillan E.A. Balaji U. Baek G. Lin W.C. Mansour J. Mollaee M. Wagner K.U. Koduru P. Yopp A. et al.Whole-exome sequencing of pancreatic cancer defines genetic diversity and therapeutic targets.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), the purely epithelial composition of PDAC organoids enabled accurate assessment of copy number alterations. NL organoids invariably showed euploidy, reinforcing their non-cancer origins, whereas most PDAC organoids acquired well-defined chromosomal alterations, namely losses of 6p, 9p, 17p, and 18q (Su et al., 1998Su G.H. Hilgers W. Shekher M.C. Tang D.J. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Alterations in pancreatic, biliary, and breast carcinomas support MKK4 as a genetically targeted tumor suppressor gene.Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2339-2342PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, four PDAC lines exhibited euploidy or near euploidy, of which three harbored KRAS mutations, confirming their cancer origin (Figure 1D). The remaining near-euploidy line (PC8) was devoid of driver-gene mutations, including those in KRAS, and its tumorigenic mechanism was unclear. Upon xenografting into orthotopic pancreata of NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Sug/Jic (NOG) mice, PDAC organoids (including the wild-type KRAS organoid) formed tumors resembling their parental PDACs, whereas NL organoids did not successfully engraft (Figure S1F). Taken together, these data indicate that niche-based selection efficiently propagated PDAC organoids with the accurate exclusion of potentially contaminating normal organoids. Once PDAC organoids were established, each organoid was subjected to successive niche-based treatments to determine minimally essential niche factors, which demonstrated that driver-gene alterations largely dictated the requirements for the corresponding niche factors. Specifically, sensitivity to EGF removal, Noggin removal/BMP4 treatment, A83-01 removal/transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) treatment, and Nutlin3 treatment were associated with KRAS, SMAD4, TGFBR2, and TP53 mutations/in-del alterations, respectively (Figures S2A–S2H). In contrast to these mutation-driven adaptations, we noted that Wnt/R-spondin dependency was mostly unrelated to Wnt-signaling mutations in PDAC organoids (Figures 2A and 2B ). Akin to the niche dependency of normal pancreas organoids, 14 PDAC organoids required both Wnt3A and R-spondin for their growth. Interestingly, the remaining R-spondin-dependent PDAC organoids grew in the absence of Wnt3A. Because R-spondin is known to potentiate Wnt signaling through stabilization of Wnt receptors (Koo et al., 2012Koo B.K. Spit M. Jordens I. Low T.Y. Stange D.E. van de Wetering M. van Es J.H. Mohammed S. Heck A.J. Maurice M.M. Clevers H. Tumour suppressor RNF43 is a stem-cell E3 ligase that induces endocytosis of Wnt receptors.Nature. 2012; 488: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), this phenotype suggested that R-spondin-dependent PDAC organoids harness either exogenously supplied or endogenously produced Wnt ligands. Therefore, we divided R-spondin-dependent PDAC organoids into two subtypes, namely Wnt-non-secreting (W−) and Wnt-secreting (W+) PDAC organoids, based on their requirements for exogenous Wnt3A. To validate the Wnt-producing capacity of W+ PDAC organoids, we tested the effect of a porcupine inhibitor (Porcn-i; C59) (Proffitt et al., 2013Proffitt K.D. Madan B. Ke Z. Pendharkar V. Ding L. Lee M.A. Hannoush R.N. Virshup D.M. Pharmacological inhibition of the Wnt acyltransferase PORCN prevents growth of WNT-driven mammary cancer.Cancer Res. 2013; 73: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), which abrogates the production of biologically active Wnt ligands. Notably, Porcn-i treatment suppressed the growth of W+ PDAC organoids in parallel with the reduction of their Wnt target gene-expression levels, and these effects were reversed by the supplementation with exogenous Wnt3A (Figures 2C and 2D). Furthermore, W+ PDAC organoids exhibited higher expression of Wnt target genes than W− PDAC organoids in the absence of Wnt3A (Figure S3A). The potent niche function of Wnt ligands secreted from W+ PDAC organoids was further validated by their growth-promoting effects on co-cultured W− PDAC organoids (Figure S3B). These results collectively indicated that W+ PDAC organoids autonomously create their own Wnt niche. We next characterized six Wnt and R-spondin-independent (WRi) PDAC organoids. To determine whether WRi PDAC organoids require Wnt-signal activation for their growth, we tested the effect of ICG001, a small-molecule inhibitor that blocks downstream Wnt-β-catenin signaling (Emami et al., 2004Emami K.H. Nguyen C. Ma H. Kim D.H. Jeong K.W. Eguchi M. Moon R.T. Teo J.L. Kim H.Y. Moon S.H. et al.A small molecule inhibitor of beta-catenin/CREB-binding protein transcription [corrected].Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12682-12687Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Upon ICG001 treatment, both W− and W+ PDAC organoids irreversibly terminated their proliferation in line with their requirement for Wnt-signal activation. In contrast, the growth of WRi PDAC organoids was maintained, suggesting that Wnt-signal activation itself was not essential for maintaining these organoids (Figure S3C). Though WRi PDAC organoids also tolerated Porcn-i treatment corroborating their dispensability of Wnt-signal activation, some WRi PDAC organoids were responsive to the Porcn-i treatment, suggesting their partial dependency on self-producing Wnt ligands (Figure S3D). In sum, our results revealed 3 functional subtypes of PDAC organoids that displayed unique requirements for Wnt and R-spondin niche environments (Figure 2E). W− PDAC cells critically depend on exogenous Wnt ligands for their survival and growth, yet the source of the Wnt ligands remains obscure. Because PDAC is characterized by abundant stromal cell infiltration, we inferred that these stromal cells could support the growth of PDACs through Wnt production. To determine the functional role of stromal Wnt ligands, we established patient-derived cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) (Figure 1A). Immunostaining of fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) and α smooth muscle actin (αSMA), characteristic markers for CAFs in PDAC (Öhlund et al., 2017Öhlund D. Handly-Santana A. Biffi G. Elyada E. Almeida A.S. Ponz-Sarvise M. Corbo V. Oni T.E. Hearn S.A. Lee E.J. et al.Distinct populations of inflammatory fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in pancreatic cancer.J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214: 579-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), confirmed that the established CAFs were of stromal origin (Figure S4A). In contrast to the quiescence induction in CAFs embedded in Matrigel (Öhlund et al., 2017Öhlund D. Handly-Santana A. Biffi G. Elyada E. Almeida A.S. Ponz-Sarvise M. Corbo V. Oni T.E. Hearn S.A. Lee E.J. et al.Distinct populations of inflammatory fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in pancreatic cancer.J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214: 579-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), CAFs in a collagen type I Matrigel mixture showed proliferation potency. To investigate whether these CAFs can functionally support the growth of W− PDAC organoids, we generated single stroma-attached organoids by aggregating dissociated PDAC cells and CAFs (Figures 3A and 3B ). Interestingly, this physical stroma attachment enabled W− PDAC organoids to grow without exogenous Wnt3A, and as expected, Porcn-i treatment abrogated this growth-promoting effect (Figures 3C and 3D). Consistent with the short-range Wnt gradient in intestinal organoids (Farin et al., 2016Farin H.F. Jordens I. Mosa M.H. Basak O. Korving J. Tauriello D.V. de Punder K. Angers S. Peters P.J. Maurice M.M. Clevers H. Visualization of a short-range Wnt gradient in the intestinal stem-cell niche.Nature. 2016; 530: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), this growth-promoting effect on W− PDAC organoids was not observed in conditioned medium from CAFs or when CAFs and W− PDAC organoids were co-cultured without physical attachment (Figure S4B). These results demonstrated that the juxtacrine interaction with PDAC cells was critical for CAFs to support the growth of W− PDACs. To further validate the pro-tumorigenic effects of CAFs on PDAC organoids in vivo, PDAC organoids were subcutaneously transplanted, either alone or with CAFs. In the absence of CAFs, W+ and WRi PDAC organoids efficiently engrafted, whereas two out of the three examined W− PDAC organoid lines were poorly tumorigenic, suggesting the requirement for Wnt niche during tumor formation. Interestingly, when interfaced with CAFs prior to transplantation, these organoids successfully formed subcutaneous tumors (Figures 3E and 3F). We observed eventual replacement of transplanted CAFs with host-derived fibroblasts (Figure S4C), suggesting that the effect of co-transplanted CAFs was limited to the initial phase of xenotransplantation. Indeed, co-transplantation with CAFs increased the engraftment rate of W− PDAC organoids but did not enhance the tumorigenic growth of xenograft-competent organoids (Figure 3F). To investigate whether the pro-tumorigenic effect of CAFs was mediated by their stromal Wnt production, we next treated xenografts with a Porcn-i (Figure S4D). Whereas the therapeutic effect of Porcn-i has only been observed in RNF43 mutant PDAC cell lines in previous studies (Jiang et al., 2013Jiang X. Hao H.X. Growney J.D. Woolfenden S. Bottiglio C. Ng N. Lu B. Hsieh M.H. Bagdasarian L. Meyer R. et al.Inactivating mutations of RNF43 confer Wnt dependency in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 12649-12654Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), Porcn-i treatment significantly reduced the growth of xenografts from two independent RNF43-wild-type W− PDAC organoids (Figure S4E). Conversely, Porcn-i treatment did not affect the growth of WRi PDAC organoids in vivo. These results demonstrated that the CAF-dependent growth of PDACs was driven by stromal Wnt niche environments and that Wnt-targeting therapeutics could be potent against wild-type W− PDACs, regardless of the RNF43 mutation status. In contrast to W− PDAC organoids, W+ PDAC organoids harnessed their self-produced Wnt ligands. To determine which Wnt ligands were expressed in PDAC organoids, their expression levels were assessed by microarray analyses. An unbiased criterion was set to select Wnt ligands that were expressed at significant levels in at least one W+ PDAC organoid line (>5 SD expression from the mean expression levels of NL organoids; Figure 4A), which nominated 6 Wnt ligands from 19 Wnt-ligand family members. To determine whether any of these Wnt ligands could serve as an epithelial Wnt niche, we overexpressed each Wnt ligand in NL organoids and examined their potential for driving niche function. In this functional assay, 4 Wnt ligands (WNT3, WNT7A, WNT7B, and WNT10A) were found to substitute for Wnt3A and, thus, were designated as “epithelial” Wnt ligands (Figures 4A and S5A). Importantly, the expression levels of these epithelial Wnt genes were significantly higher in WRi and W+ PDAC organoids than in W− PDAC organoids, indicating the association between epithelial Wnt-ligand expression and Wnt niche independency (Figure 4B). To determine whether epithelial Wnt ligands are expressed in clinical specimens, we analyzed their expression levels in whole PDAC tissues using a publicly available transcriptome dataset. Hierarchical clustering of Wnt-ligand gene-expression levels aggregated the epithelial Wnt-ligand genes in a single cluster (Figure S5B). WNT2, WNT2B, WNT4, and WNT5A were expressed in PDAC tissues but were rarely detected in organoids, suggesting their stromal origins. Real-time qPCR analyses of Wnt ligand gene-expression levels in organoids and CAFs confirmed these tissue-specific expression patterns (Figure 4C). Of note, the functional assay revealed that only WNT2 and WNT2B served as potent niche factors among stromal Wnt ligands (Figure 4A). To determine the differential expression of epithelial Wnts in patients, we next performed in situ hybridization of the clinical specimens for the epithelial Wnt genes. WNT7B and WNT10A were markedly expressed in the epithelial component of W+ PDACs, whereas no or subtle expression of these genes was observed in W− PDACs and adjacent normal pancreas tissues (Figure 4D). Stromal expression of WNT2B was detected in close proximity to PDAC tissue (Figure 4D), consistent with the short-range activity of Wnt ligands. These results suggested that the expression of epithelial Wnts could serve as a surrogate marker to define Wnt-producing PDACs. In addition, the high expression of epithelial Wnts in clinical PDACs was associated with significantly poor survival and metastatic progression (Figures 4E and S5C). These results demonstrated that W+ PDACs cell autonomously activated their own Wnt signaling by expressing epithelial Wnts, which also predicts aggressive clinical behaviors. To explore the mechanisms underlying each functional PDAC subtype, we performed transcriptome analyses of the PTOL. An unbiased projection of global gene expression with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) analysis illustrated linearly connected gene expression clusters corresponding to the Wnt niche subtypes (Figure 5A). Notably, the linear trajectory was directed from normal organoids toward W−, W+, and WRi subtypes, suggesting serial transition of gene expression signature in line with acquisition of Wnt niche independency.

Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal the molecular dynamics and diversity of dentate gyrus cell types in perinatal, juvenile, and adult mice. We found distinct quiescent and proliferating progenitor cell types, linked by transient intermediate states to neuroblast stages and fully mature granule cells. We observed shifts in the molecular identity of quiescent and proliferating radial glia and granule cells during the postnatal period that were then maintained through adult stages. In contrast, intermediate progenitor cells, neuroblasts, and immature granule cells were nearly indistinguishable at all ages. These findings demonstrate the fundamental similarity of postnatal and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and pinpoint the early postnatal transformation of radial glia from embryonic progenitors to adult quiescent stem cells. Using single-cell RNA-seq, the authors show that early developmental neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is largely conserved in the adult, but with a perinatal transformation of stem cells to an adult type."
https://openalex.org/W2783571957,"Internal N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is widespread in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and is catalyzed by heterodimers of methyltransferase-like protein 3 (Mettl3) and Mettl14. To understand the role of m6A in development, we deleted Mettl14 in embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) in a mouse model. Phenotypically, NSCs lacking Mettl14 displayed markedly decreased proliferation and premature differentiation, suggesting that m6A modification enhances NSC self-renewal. Decreases in the NSC pool led to a decreased number of late-born neurons during cortical neurogenesis. Mechanistically, we discovered a genome-wide increase in specific histone modifications in Mettl14 knockout versus control NSCs. These changes correlated with altered gene expression and observed cellular phenotypes, suggesting functional significance of altered histone modifications in knockout cells. Finally, we found that m6A regulates histone modification in part by destabilizing transcripts that encode histone-modifying enzymes. Our results suggest an essential role for m6A in development and reveal m6A-regulated histone modifications as a previously unknown mechanism of gene regulation in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2952203741,"Chromosomal architecture is known to influence gene expression, yet its role in controlling cell fate remains poorly understood. Reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) by the transcription factors (TFs) OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC offers an opportunity to address this question but is severely limited by the low proportion of responding cells. We have recently developed a highly efficient reprogramming protocol that synchronously converts somatic into pluripotent stem cells. Here, we used this system to integrate time-resolved changes in genome topology with gene expression, TF binding and chromatin-state dynamics. The results showed that TFs drive topological genome reorganization at multiple architectural levels, often before changes in gene expression. Removal of locus-specific topological barriers can explain why pluripotency genes are activated sequentially, instead of simultaneously, during reprogramming. Together, our results implicate genome topology as an instructive force for implementing transcriptional programs and cell fate in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2783471328,"Therapeutic harnessing of adaptive immunity via checkpoint inhibition has transformed the treatment of many cancers. Despite unprecedented long-term responses, most patients do not respond to these therapies. Immunotherapy non-responders often harbor high levels of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—an immunosuppressive innate cell population. Through genetic and pharmacological approaches, we uncovered a pathway governing MDSC abundance in multiple cancer types. Therapeutic liver-X nuclear receptor (LXR) agonism reduced MDSC abundance in murine models and in patients treated in a first-in-human dose escalation phase 1 trial. MDSC depletion was associated with activation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in mice and patients. The LXR transcriptional target ApoE mediated these effects in mice, where LXR/ApoE activation therapy elicited robust anti-tumor responses and also enhanced T cell activation during various immune-based therapies. We implicate the LXR/ApoE axis in the regulation of innate immune suppression and as a target for enhancing the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2783764907,"The unique metabolic demands of cancer cells underscore potentially fruitful opportunities for drug discovery in the era of precision medicine. However, therapeutic targeting of cancer metabolism has led to surprisingly few new drugs to date. The neutral amino acid glutamine serves as a key intermediate in numerous metabolic processes leveraged by cancer cells, including biosynthesis, cell signaling, and oxidative protection. Herein we report the preclinical development of V-9302, a competitive small molecule antagonist of transmembrane glutamine flux that selectively and potently targets the amino acid transporter ASCT2. Pharmacological blockade of ASCT2 with V-9302 resulted in attenuated cancer cell growth and proliferation, increased cell death, and increased oxidative stress, which collectively contributed to antitumor responses in vitro and in vivo. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate the utility of a pharmacological inhibitor of glutamine transport in oncology, representing a new class of targeted therapy and laying a framework for paradigm-shifting therapies targeting cancer cell metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2783878221,"Therapeutic ex vivo T-cell expansion is limited by low rates and T-cell products of limited functionality. Here we describe a system that mimics natural antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and consists of a fluid lipid bilayer supported by mesoporous silica micro-rods. The lipid bilayer presents membrane-bound cues for T-cell receptor stimulation and costimulation, while the micro-rods enable sustained release of soluble paracrine cues. Using anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and interleukin-2, we show that the APC-mimetic scaffolds (APC-ms) promote two- to tenfold greater polyclonal expansion of primary mouse and human T cells compared with commercial expansion beads (Dynabeads). The efficiency of expansion depends on the density of stimulatory cues and the amount of material in the starting culture. Following a single stimulation, APC-ms enables antigen-specific expansion of rare cytotoxic T-cell subpopulations at a greater magnitude than autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells after 2 weeks. APC-ms support over fivefold greater expansion of restimulated CD19 CAR-T cells than Dynabeads, with similar efficacy in a xenograft lymphoma model."

Here we found that PML is frequently co-deleted with PTEN in metastatic human prostate cancer (CaP). We demonstrated that conditional inactivation of Pml in the mouse prostate morphs indolent Pten-null tumors into lethal metastatic disease. We identified MAPK reactivation, subsequent hyperactivation of an aberrant SREBP prometastatic lipogenic program, and a distinctive lipidomic profile as key characteristic features of metastatic Pml and Pten double-null CaP. Furthermore, targeting SREBP in vivo by fatostatin blocked both tumor growth and distant metastasis. Importantly, a high-fat diet (HFD) induced lipid accumulation in prostate tumors and was sufficient to drive metastasis in a nonmetastatic Pten-null mouse model of CaP, and an SREBP signature was highly enriched in metastatic human CaP. Thus, our findings uncover a prometastatic lipogenic program and lend direct genetic and experimental support to the notion that a Western HFD can promote metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2783583681,"A diet rich in salt is linked to an increased risk of cerebrovascular diseases and dementia, but it remains unclear how dietary salt harms the brain. We report that, in mice, excess dietary salt suppresses resting cerebral blood flow and endothelial function, leading to cognitive impairment. The effect depends on expansion of TH17 cells in the small intestine, resulting in a marked increase in plasma interleukin-17 (IL-17). Circulating IL-17, in turn, promotes endothelial dysfunction and cognitive impairment by the Rho kinase-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and reduced nitric oxide production in cerebral endothelial cells. The findings reveal a new gut-brain axis linking dietary habits to cognitive impairment through a gut-initiated adaptive immune response compromising brain function via circulating IL-17. Thus, the TH17 cell-IL-17 pathway is a putative target to counter the deleterious brain effects induced by dietary salt and other diseases associated with TH17 polarization."

Here, using a genetically inducible model of KRAS loss of heterozygosity (LOH), we show that KRAS dimerization mediates wild-type KRAS-dependent fitness of human and murine KRAS mutant LUAD tumor cells and underlies resistance to MEK inhibition. These effects are abrogated when wild-type KRAS is replaced by KRASD154Q, a mutant that disrupts dimerization at the α4-α5 KRAS dimer interface without changing other fundamental biochemical properties of KRAS, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, dimerization has a critical role in the oncogenic activity of mutant KRAS. Our studies provide mechanistic and biological insights into the role of KRAS dimerization and highlight a role for disruption of dimerization as a therapeutic strategy for KRAS mutant cancers."

Here we show that mtDNA mutations are present in primordial germ cells (PGCs) within healthy female human embryos. Isolated PGCs have a profound reduction in mtDNA content, with discrete mitochondria containing ~5 mtDNA molecules. Single-cell deep mtDNA sequencing of in vivo human female PGCs showed rare variants reaching higher heteroplasmy levels in late PGCs, consistent with the observed genetic bottleneck. We also saw the signature of selection against non-synonymous protein-coding, tRNA gene and D-loop variants, concomitant with a progressive upregulation of genes involving mtDNA replication and transcription, and linked to a transition from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism. The associated metabolic shift would expose deleterious mutations to selection during early germ cell development, preventing the relentless accumulation of mtDNA mutations in the human population predicted by Muller's ratchet. Mutations escaping this mechanism will show shifts in heteroplasmy levels within one human generation, explaining the extreme phenotypic variation seen in human pedigrees with inherited mtDNA disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2783873937,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are pathologically activated and relatively immature myeloid cells that have been implicated in the immunological regulation of many pathologic conditions. Phenotypically and morphologically, MDSCs are similar to neutrophils (PMN-MDSCs) and monocytes (M-MDSCs). However, they have potent suppressive activity and distinct gene expression profiles and biochemical characteristics. No or very few MDSCs are observed in steady-state physiological conditions. Therefore, until recently, accumulation of MDSCs was considered a consequence of pathological processes or pregnancy. Here, we report that MDSCs with a potent ability to suppress T cells are present during the first weeks of life in mice and humans. MDSC suppressive activity was triggered by lactoferrin and mediated by nitric oxide, PGE2, and S100A9 and S100A8 proteins. MDSCs from newborns had a transcriptome similar to that of tumor MDSCs, but with strong upregulation of an antimicrobial gene network, and had potent antibacterial activity. MDSCs played a critical role in control of experimental necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in newborn mice. MDSCs in infants with very low weight, who are prone to NEC, had lower MDSC levels and suppressive activity than did infants with normal weight. Thus, the transitory presence of MDSCs may be critical for regulation of inflammation in newborns."
https://openalex.org/W2782193891,"The mechanisms by which mitochondrial metabolism supports cancer anabolism remain unclear. Here, we found that genetic and pharmacological inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase A1 (PDHA1), a subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), inhibits prostate cancer development in mouse and human xenograft tumor models by affecting lipid biosynthesis. Mechanistically, we show that in prostate cancer, PDC localizes in both the mitochondria and the nucleus. Whereas nuclear PDC controls the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor (SREBF)-target genes by mediating histone acetylation, mitochondrial PDC provides cytosolic citrate for lipid synthesis in a coordinated manner, thereby sustaining anabolism. Additionally, we found that PDHA1 and the PDC activator pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (PDP1) are frequently amplified and overexpressed at both the gene and protein levels in prostate tumors. Together, these findings demonstrate that both mitochondrial and nuclear PDC sustain prostate tumorigenesis by controlling lipid biosynthesis, thus suggesting this complex as a potential target for cancer therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2783502736,"Chromosome dosage has substantial effects on reproductive isolation and speciation in both plants and animals, but the underlying mechanisms are largely obscure 1 . Transposable elements in animals can regulate hybridity through maternal small RNA 2 , whereas small RNAs in plants have been postulated to regulate dosage response via neighboring imprinted genes3,4. Here we show that a highly conserved microRNA in plants, miR845, targets the tRNAMet primer-binding site (PBS) of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons in Arabidopsis pollen, and triggers the accumulation of 21-22-nucleotide (nt) small RNAs in a dose-dependent fashion via RNA polymerase IV. We show that these epigenetically activated small interfering RNAs (easiRNAs) mediate hybridization barriers between diploid seed parents and tetraploid pollen parents (the 'triploid block'), and that natural variation for miR845 may account for 'endosperm balance' allowing the formation of triploid seeds. Targeting of the PBS with small RNA is a common mechanism for transposon control in mammals and plants, and provides a uniquely sensitive means to monitor chromosome dosage and imprinting in the developing seed."
https://openalex.org/W2763573503,"The regulation of parental genome dosage is of fundamental importance in animals and plants, as exemplified by X-chromosome inactivation and dosage compensation. The 'triploid block' is a classic example of dosage regulation in plants that establishes a reproductive barrier between species differing in chromosome number1,2. This barrier acts in the embryo-nourishing endosperm tissue and induces the abortion of hybrid seeds through a yet unknown mechanism 3 . Here we show that depletion of paternal epigenetically activated small interfering RNAs (easiRNAs) bypasses the triploid block in response to increased paternal ploidy in Arabidopsis thaliana. Paternal loss of the plant-specific RNA polymerase IV suppressed easiRNA formation and rescued triploid seeds by restoring small-RNA-directed DNA methylation at transposable elements (TEs), correlating with reduced expression of paternally expressed imprinted genes (PEGs). Our data suggest that easiRNAs form a quantitative signal for paternal chromosome number and that their balanced dosage is required for post-fertilization genome stability and seed viability."
https://openalex.org/W2783862258,"Peter Scacheri and colleagues report that the activity of enhancer elements in metastatic osteosarcoma is distinct from that in primary tumors and plays a functional role in metastatic progression of osteosarcoma. Metastasis results from a complex set of traits acquired by tumor cells, distinct from those necessary for tumorigenesis. Here, we investigate the contribution of enhancer elements to the metastatic phenotype of osteosarcoma. Through epigenomic profiling, we identify substantial differences in enhancer activity between primary and metastatic human tumors and between near isogenic pairs of highly lung metastatic and nonmetastatic osteosarcoma cell lines. We term these regions metastatic variant enhancer loci (Met-VELs). Met-VELs drive coordinated waves of gene expression during metastatic colonization of the lung. Met-VELs cluster nonrandomly in the genome, indicating that activity of these enhancers and expression of their associated gene targets are positively selected. As evidence of this causal association, osteosarcoma lung metastasis is inhibited by global interruptions of Met-VEL-associated gene expression via pharmacologic BET inhibition, by knockdown of AP-1 transcription factors that occupy Met-VELs, and by knockdown or functional inhibition of individual genes activated by Met-VELs, such as that encoding coagulation factor III/tissue factor (F3). We further show that genetic deletion of a single Met-VEL at the F3 locus blocks metastatic cell outgrowth in the lung. These findings indicate that Met-VELs and the genes they regulate play a functional role in metastasis and may be suitable targets for antimetastatic therapies."

We analyze the quantitative effects of activation and knockout to calculate genetic interaction and directionality scores for each gene pair. Based on the results from over 100,000 perturbed gene pairs, we reconstruct a directional dependency network for human K562 leukemia cells and demonstrate how our approach allows the determination of directionality in activating genetic interactions.

Mammalian cells express two PCK genes, encoding for a cytoplasmic (PCPEK-C or PCK1) and a mitochondrial (PEPCK-M or PCK2) isoforms, respectively. Increased expressions of both PCK genes are found in cancer of several organs, including colon, lung, and skin, and linked to increased anabolic metabolism and cell proliferation. Here, we report that the expressions of both PCK1 and PCK2 genes are downregulated in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and low PCK expression was associated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Forced expression of either PCK1 or PCK2 in liver cancer cell lines results in severe apoptosis under the condition of glucose deprivation and suppressed liver tumorigenesis in mice. Mechanistically, we show that the pro-apoptotic effect of PCK1 requires its catalytic activity. We demonstrate that forced PCK1 expression in glucose-starved liver cancer cells induced TCA cataplerosis, leading to energy crisis and oxidative stress. Replenishing TCA intermediate α-ketoglutarate or inhibition of reactive oxygen species production blocked the cell death caused by PCK expression. Taken together, our data reveal that PCK1 is detrimental to malignant hepatocytes and suggest activating PCK1 expression as a potential treatment strategy for patients with HCC."

We therefore asked whether DG inputs to CA3 contribute to spatial working memory by promoting SWR generation. Recordings from DG and CA3 while rats performed a dentate-dependent working memory task on an eight-arm radial maze revealed that the activity of dentate neurons and the incidence rate of SWRs both increased during reward consumption. We then found reduced reward-related CA3 SWR generation without direct input from dentate granule neurons. Furthermore, CA3 cells with place fields in not-yet-visited arms preferentially fired during SWRs at reward locations, and these prospective CA3 firing patterns were more pronounced for correct trials and were dentate-dependent. These results indicate that coordination of CA3 neuronal activity patterns by DG is necessary for the generation of neuronal firing patterns that support goal-directed behavior and memory. Sasaki et al. reveal that the dentate gyrus not only performs pattern separation but also has a direct role in organizing memory-guided behavior by coordinating the planning of future actions."

Exploiting the synchronized, cyclical bouts of tissue regeneration in hair follicles (HFs), we investigate how microenvironment dynamics shape the emergence of stem cell lineages. Employing epigenetic and ChIP-seq profiling, we uncover how signal-dependent transcription factors couple spatiotemporal cues to chromatin dynamics, thereby choreographing stem cell lineages. Using enhancer-driven reporters, mutagenesis, and genetics, we show that simultaneous BMP-inhibitory and WNT signals set the stage for lineage choices by establishing chromatin platforms permissive for diversification. Mechanistically, when binding of BMP effector pSMAD1 is relieved, enhancers driving HF-stem cell master regulators are silenced. Concomitantly, multipotent, lineage-fated enhancers silent in HF-stem cells become activated by exchanging WNT effectors TCF3/4 for LEF1. Throughout regeneration, lineage enhancers continue reliance upon LEF1 but then achieve specificity by accommodating additional incoming signaling effectors.

These cells are thought to resemble a primed pluripotent state found in the murine epiblast (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M.

Self-renewal in hESCs requires the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways, whose effector proteins, SMAD2/3 and ERK1/2, interface with the transcriptional network in the nucleus (Göke et al., 2013Göke J.

The core factors NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2/3 are reorganized into different modules to suppress epiblast cell fates (Wang et al., 2012Wang Z. Oron E. Nelson B. Razis S. Ivanova N.

However, homologs of transcriptional regulators of mESCs, such as ESRRB and TBX3, are not expressed in hESCs. Instead, PRDM14, FOXO1, and LSD1, all of which appear to be dispensable for mESC self-renewal, have been identified as regulators of hESC pluripotency (Adamo et al., 2011Adamo A. Sesé B. Boue S. Castaño J. Paramonov I. Barrero M.J. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. LSD1 regulates the balance between self-renewal and differentiation in human embryonic stem cells.Nat.

Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 1092-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Here, we combine functional, biochemical, and genomics approaches to screen for additional regulators of primed pluripotency in humans. We identify the BCL6 corepressor (BCOR) as a critical factor for hESC maintenance and show that BCOR defines a subtype of the PRC1 complexes with distinct recruitment and repression mechanisms that are essential for silencing differentiation programs in hESCs. To identify additional regulators of hESCs, we performed microarray profiling of H1 hESC line differentiating in the presence of retinoic acid. We selected 59 genes with functions related to transcription and chromatin that were expressed in hESCs but downregulated upon differentiation (Figure S1A). Interrogating this gene set with small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) identified five genes whose depletion led to a loss of proliferative capacity, morphological changes, and the induction of differentiation markers (Figures S1B–S1E). Of these positive hits, PRDM14 and FOXO1 have been reported as hESC regulators (Chia et al., 2010Chia N.Y. Chan Y.S. Feng B. Lu X. Orlov Y.L. Moreau D. Kumar P. Yang L. Jiang J. Lau M.S. et al.A genome-wide RNAi screen reveals determinants of human embryonic stem cell identity.Nature. 2010; 468: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2011Zhang X.

Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 1092-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), while the three remaining genes (ZFP42, ZNF649, and BCOR) have not been implicated in hESC maintenance. While knockdown of FOXO1, ZFP42, and ZNF649 in H7 and H9 cells failed to induce differentiation (data not shown), depletion of BCOR induced a robust, consistent loss-of-proliferation phenotype in all three cell lines tested (Figures 1A–1C). Thus far, only four factors (NANOG, OCT4, SOX2/3, and PRDM14) have been shown to be required in multiple hESC lines. We examined the consequences of BCOR knockdown (shBCOR) in hESCs. There was no increase in apoptotic or dead cells in shBCOR-hESC cultures compared to cells transduced with a non-targeting control vector (control ESCs) (Figure 1D). Cell-cycle analysis revealed an increase in the duration of the G1 phase, while the S phase was shortened (Figure 1E). shBCOR hESCs were morphologically distinct from control hESCs (Figure 1F). shBCOR hESCs also exhibited an abnormal balance of pluripotency factors. RNA and protein levels of POU5F1/OCT4 were unaltered, while NANOG was upregulated and SOX2 was reduced (Figure 1G). Immunofluorescence analyses confirmed the induction of mesoderm and endoderm markers in shBCOR hESCs (Figure 1H). For validation, we derived a BCOR rescue line (BCORR hESCs) in which endogenous BCOR was inactivated via a frameshift mutation while doxycycline (Dox)-inducible FLAG-BCOR and rtTA transgenes introduced into the AAVS1 locus allowed for self-renewal in the presence of Dox (Figure 1I). Upon Dox removal, BCOR was lost, and the cells had a phenotype similar to shBCOR ESCs (Figures 1J–1L). These analyses identify BCOR as a core component of the hESC regulatory network governing the pluripotent state. BCOR was initially identified as a corepressor that interacts with the B cell transcription factor BCL6 (Huynh et al., 2000Huynh K.D. Fischle W. Verdin E. Bardwell V.J. BCoR, a novel corepressor involved in BCL-6 repression.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1810-1823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In several cell types, BCOR co-purifies with a non-canonical PRC1.1 complex (Béguelin et al., 2016Béguelin W. Teater M. Gearhart M.D. Calvo Fernández M.T. Goldstein R.L. Cárdenas M.G. Hatzi K.

Rep. 2015; 5: 18388Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To identify BCOR-interacting proteins in hESCs, we performed FLAG immunoprecipitation (IP) from BCORR hESCs followed by mass spectrometry. While BCL6 was not identified in these IPs, the PRC1.1 components PCGF1, RNF2, RING1, RYBP, KDM2B, and USP7 and the heat shock protein HSPD1 were among the top hits. PRC2 and canonical PRC1-specific proteins were not detected (Figures 2A and 2B ; Table S1). Next, we carried out sucrose-gradient centrifugation of nuclear extracts from BCORR hESCs. In the presence of Dox, BCOR, RNF2, PCGF1, and KDM2B co-fractionated in the megadalton-size range, suggesting the existence of the common complex (Figure 2C). Upon removal of Dox, the distributions of KDM2B and PCGF1 shifted toward lower-molecular-weight fractions, indicating that BCOR interacts with both proteins and may link KDM2B to the PRC1.1 core, which consists of RNF2, PCGF1, and RYBP. While the majority of HSPD1 fractionated outside the range of the BCOR complexes, a small amount was detected in high-molecular-weight fractions also containing BCOR, RNF2, PCGF1, and KDM2B. To study the assembly of the BCOR-PRC1.1 complexes, we overexpressed individual components in HEK293FT cells, followed by FLAG-affinity capture. The PRC1.1 core was recovered in both FLAG-BCOR and FLAG-KDM2B IPs. Both BCOR and the PRC1.1 core were recovered in FLAG-KDM2B IP, but the interaction between KDM2B and the core was lost when BCOR was removed (Figure S2A). HSPD1 was recovered in all reconstitution experiments that contained BCOR but did not associate with either the PRC1.1 core or the KDM2B/SKP1 subcomplex, indicating a specific interaction with BCOR (Figure S2B). To validate these results, we performed co-IP in BCORR hESCs maintained with or without Dox. Both KDM2B and the PRC1.1 core were recovered when either KDM2B or RNF2 was used as bait in the presence of Dox. Similar interactions were also observed in the absence of Dox (Figure S2C). Because the expression of the BCOR homolog BCORL1 in hESCs is very low (Figure S3A), we concluded that the minimal KDM2B-PRC1.1 complexes, which have been reported in mESCs and Drosophila embryos (Lagarou et al., 2008Lagarou A. Mohd-Sarip A. Moshkin Y.M. Chalkley G.E. Bezstarosti K. Demmers J.A.

No HSPD1 was detected in KDM2B and RNF2 IPs, in either the presence or absence of Dox/BCOR, indicating that the HSPD1-BCOR-PRC1.1 complexes are not abundant (Figure S2C). To determine how the genomic distribution of BCOR correlates with the distributions of the components of the PRC1/2 complexes, DNA accessibility, and transcriptional state, we mapped the binding of BCOR, KDM2B, PCGF1, RNF2, RYBP, and the PRC1.1-associated chromatin marks H2AK119ub and H3K36me2. Published chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data for the PRC2 component SUZ12 and H3K27me3, the canonical PRC1 subunit CBX2, which is abundant in hESCs (Figure S3A), and marks of chromatin accessibility and transcription such as DNase I, H3K4me3, H3K79me3, and POL2-Ser5p/7p phosphorylation states were added to this dataset. Because BCOR binding exhibited a strong bias toward the promoter regions (Figure S2B), our analyses were focused on the 20-kb intervals centered on the transcription start sites (TSSs). K-means clustering with these 16 parameters separated all 57,728 annotated promoter regions into three distinct groups (Figure 2D). The strong-binding group contained 2,610 promoters with the highest PRC1.1 levels. Developmental regulators, particularly transcription factors of different families, were overrepresented in this group (Figure S2C). Promoters in this group were also highly enriched for SUZ12, H3K27me3, and CBX2, in agreement with reports demonstrating co-occupancy of cPRC1, ncPRC1, and PRC2 at many genomic loci (Blackledge et al., 2014Blackledge N.P. Farcas A.M. Kondo T. King H.W. McGouran J.F. Hanssen L.L. Ito S. Cooper S. Kondo K.

The weak-binding group contained 14,277 promoters with lower levels of PRC1.1 components. This group had a more diverse ontology with enrichment for cell division, mRNA splicing, protein transport, and other housekeeping cellular processes (Figure S2C). Promoters in both the strong- and the weak-binding groups had elevated levels of marks associated with transcriptional activation such as DNase I hypersensitivity, H3K4me3, H3K79me2, and POL2-Ser5p/7p, in contrast to promoters in the no-binding group (40,841 regions), the majority of which were transcriptionally inert regions. Further analyses revealed strong correlation between PRC1.1 and PRC2 components in the strong-binding group (Figure 2E). PRC1.1 and PRC2 binding in the strong group correlated positively with DNase I hypersensitivity and POL2-Ser5p signals, but not with POL2-Ser7p and H3K79me2, indicating that the majority of genes in this group may be primed, but not transcribed. In contrast, there was a positive correlation between PRC1.1 and POL2-Ser5p/7p in the weak-binding group (Figure 2E). It has been shown that PRC targets showing co-occupancy of PRC1 and POL2-Ser2p in bulk analyses are not co-bound but are fluctuating between actively transcribed and repressed states (Brookes et al., 2012Brookes E. de Santiago I. Hebenstreit D. Morris K.J. Carroll T. Xie S.Q. Stock J.K. Heidemann M. Eick D. Nozaki N. et al.Polycomb associates genome-wide with a specific RNA polymerase II variant, and regulates metabolic genes in ESCs.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 157-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A significant fraction of BCOR-PRC1.1 weak-binding group targets in hESCs very likely correspond to such fluctuating targets. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses in shBCOR and control hESCs showed that expression levels of 1,571 genes, of which 1,082 (68.9%) were BCOR-PRC1.1 direct targets, were significantly altered. The transcriptional response was biased toward the upregulated genes, 30% of which were BCOR-PRC1.1 targets from the strong-binding group (Figure S2D). The upregulated gene group was enriched for gene ontologies associated with primitive streak formation, endoderm differentiation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, BMP4, TGF-β, and WNT signaling, suggesting that derepression of these genes following BCOR depletion is the major cause of differentiation (Figure S2E). Not all BCOR-PRC1.1 targets in the strong-binding group are derepressed in shBCOR hESCs. To identify parameters correlating with the promoter response to BCOR depletion, we compared the levels of 16 parameters shown in Figure 2D at upregulated, downregulated, and non-responsive targets within each binding group. For the strong-binding group, the levels of BCOR and other PRC1.1 components were not significantly different. However, the levels of RNF2, H2AK119ub, SUZ12, and H3K27me3 were on average higher at non-responsive targets (Figures 2G and S2H). These data suggest that BCOR-independent recruitment of the PRC2/cPRC1 complexes at non-responsive targets could counteract gene activation resulting from BCOR loss. Together, our mass spectrometry, chromatin localization, and gene expression data indicate that the BCOR-PRC1.1 complex represses key developmental regulators in hESCs. To probe the role of BCOR in PRC1.1 recruitment and function, we performed ChIP-qPCR analyses in shBCOR hESCs. We selected a set of BCOR targets from the strong-binding group that were associated with particularly large Polycomb domains. This set included the BCOR-responsive targets EOMES, T, FOXA2, SOX17, and GATA6 and the non-responsive targets GSX2, EN2, NEUROD1, SOX1, and VAX2 (Figure S4A). Depletion of BCOR resulted in decreased RNF2 and KDM2B binding and was accompanied by the loss of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 at both responsive and non-responsive targets, while a gain of H3K4me3 was observed only at BCOR-responsive genes (Figure 3A). Time-course analyses in BCORR hESCs differentiating in the absence of Dox revealed that BCOR was sharply depleted at all loci tested after Dox removal. A decrease in RNF2, H3K27me3, and H2AK119ub followed, while KDM2B enrichment was lost more gradually (Figure 3B). Non-responsive targets exhibited similar trends, but of a lesser magnitude. Furthermore, after their initial decline, the RNF2 and H3K27me3 levels at these targets were partially restored (Figure 3B). The coordinated recovery of H3K27me3 and RNF2 levels suggest that the PRC2/cPRC1 complexes at non-responsive targets could be recruited independently of BCOR and the PRC1.1 complex. Indeed, ChIP-qPCR analyses of CBX2 alongside with RYBP in BCORR hESCs maintained without Dox demonstrated a significant decrease in both CBX2 and RYBP levels at BCOR-responsive targets. At non-responsive targets, CBX2 was largely retained, and RYBP was lost at some (GSX2 and NEUROD1) but retained at other (SOX1 and VAX2) targets that appear to recruit RYBP independently of BCOR (Figure 3C). Because the loss of RNF2, H2AK119ub, and H3K27me3 at BCOR-responsive targets after Dox removal occurs slower than the loss of BCOR itself, we tested whether the effects of BCOR depletion on PRC1 and PRC2 levels are secondary to transcriptional activation of BCOR targets. We used shRNA to deplete BCOR in hESCs that had a Dox-inducible dCas9-KRAB repressor integrated into the AAVS1 locus (Figure S4B). Using lentiviral single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), we tethered this repressor to the TSS region of the EOMES gene. In the presence of Dox, dCas9-KRAB inhibited EOMES transcription. The EOMES-regulated endodermal genes SOX17 and FOXA2, which are BCOR-PRC1.1 targets, were also downregulated. ChIP-qPCR analyses in these cells demonstrated that reduced transcription did not prevent decay of H3K27me3, CBX2, RNF2, or RYBP at any of these three loci (Figures S4B–S4D). Thus, it is unlikely that the loss of PRC1.1 and PRC2 components at BCOR-responsive genes occurs solely due to activation of transcription. These data indicate that the presence of BCOR at BCOR-responsive targets is crucial for the recruitment of the PRC1.1 complex, the maintenance of H3K27me3, and the recruitment of the cPRC1 complexes. Studies in mESCs have indicated that the CXXC domain of KDM2B is involved in recruiting the PRC1.1 complex to unmethylated CpG islands (Blackledge et al., 2014Blackledge N.P. Farcas A.M. Kondo T.

If the same holds true in hESCs, depletion of KDM2B should phenocopy the BCOR depletion phenotype by triggering the loss of Polycomb domains, induction of BCOR targets, and initiation of differentiation. To test this prediction, we knocked down KDM2B in hESCs with shRNA. Surprisingly, differentiation did not occur (Figures S3A–S3D).

https://openalex.org/W4254401858,"A method called Light Activated Structural Examination of RNA (LASER) enables monitoring of the solvent accessibility of purine nucleobases and identifies rapid structural changes of cellular RNA–protein interactions and intracellular RNA structures. The discovery of functional RNAs that are critical for normal and disease physiology continues to expand at a breakneck pace. Many RNA functions are controlled by the formation of specific structures, and an understanding of each structural component is necessary to elucidate its function. Measuring solvent accessibility intracellularly with experimental ease is an unmet need in the field. Here, we present a novel method for probing nucleobase solvent accessibility, Light Activated Structural Examination of RNA (LASER). LASER depends on light activation of a small molecule, nicotinoyl azide (NAz), to measure solvent accessibility of purine nucleobases. In vitro, this technique accurately monitors solvent accessibility and identifies rapid structural changes resulting from ligand binding in a metabolite-responsive RNA. LASER probing can further identify cellular RNA–protein interactions and unique intracellular RNA structures. Our photoactivation technique provides an adaptable framework to structurally characterize solvent accessibility of RNA in many environments."

They form 800- to 1000-kDa double-ring complexes, with each ring enclosing a central cavity that functions as a nano-compartment for a single molecule of substrate protein (SP) to fold unimpaired by aggregation. In the case of the bacterial chaperonin, GroEL, and its homologs in mitochondria and chloroplasts, a lid-shaped cofactor, GroES, is required to close the folding chamber in an ATP-regulated reaction cycle. This process involves a network of nested cooperativity, with positive cooperativity of ATP-binding and hydrolysis within GroEL rings and negative cooperativity between rings (Gruber and Horovitz, 2016Gruber R.

Despite intensive research, how exactly the two rings function in a coordinated manner is only partially understood. In one model, the two rings alternate between folding active and inactive states in a sequential mechanism, while in another, the two rings are proposed to function independently and to be folding active simultaneously (Hayer-Hartl et al., 2016Hayer-Hartl M.

Biol. 2015; 427: 2912-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and 1B). GroEL consists of two heptameric rings of ∼57-kDa subunits that are stacked back to back such that each subunit in one ring contacts two subunits in the opposite ring (Hayer-Hartl et al., 2016Hayer-Hartl M. Bracher A. Hartl F.U. The GroEL-GroES chaperonin machine: A nano-cage for protein folding.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 62-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, Saibil et al., 2013Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Clare D.K. Horwich A.L. Structure and allostery of the chaperonin GroEL.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 1476-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The GroEL subunit is composed of an equatorial ATPase domain, an intermediate hinge domain, and an apical domain (Figures 1A and 1B). The apical domains form the flexible ring opening and expose hydrophobic amino acid residues toward the central cavity for the binding of non-native SP. GroES is a heptameric ring of ∼10-kDa subunits that caps the SP-bound GroEL ring, forming the so-called cis complex. This step is preceded by the binding of seven ATP to the cis ring and results in the displacement of SP into an enlarged hydrophilic chamber for folding (Xu et al., 1997Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. The crystal structure of the asymmetric GroEL-GroES-(ADP)7 chaperonin complex.Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). In the sequential model (also referred to as the asymmetric cycle), SP is free to fold inside this cage for the time needed for ATP hydrolysis (∼2–7 s, dependent on temperature) (Figure 1A). During this time, the open trans ring can bind a new non-native SP. After ATP hydrolysis in the cis ring, ATP binding to the trans ring causes the dissociation of ADP and GroES, allowing SP release. GroES binding to the trans ring forms a new, folding-active cis chamber (Rye et al., 1999Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. GroEL-GroES cycling: ATP and nonnative polypeptide direct alternation of folding-active rings.Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Asymmetric GroEL:GroES complexes predominate, due to the negative allosteric coupling of the GroEL rings, which is mediated by critical contacts at the inter-ring interface of the equatorial domains (Gruber and Horovitz, 2016Gruber R. Horovitz A. Allosteric mechanisms in chaperonin machines.Chem. Rev. 2016; 116: 6588-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Saibil et al., 2013Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Clare D.K. Horwich A.L. Structure and allostery of the chaperonin GroEL.J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425: 1476-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the non-sequential model (also referred to as the symmetric cycle; Ye and Lorimer, 2013Ye X. Lorimer G.H. Substrate protein switches GroE chaperonins from asymmetric to symmetric cycling by catalyzing nucleotide exchange.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E4289-E4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B), GroES binds simultaneously to both GroEL rings and dissociates stochastically upon ATP hydrolysis, with SP catalyzing nucleotide exchange (Hayer-Hartl et al., 2016Hayer-Hartl M. Bracher A. Hartl F.U. The GroEL-GroES chaperonin machine: A nano-cage for protein folding.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2016; 41: 62-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, Taguchi, 2015Taguchi H. Reaction cycle of chaperonin GroEL via symmetric “football” intermediate.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 2912-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Symmetric GroEL:GroES2 complexes are thought to be the major populated species (Yang et al., 2013Yang D. Ye X. Lorimer G.H. Symmetric GroEL:GroES2 complexes are the protein-folding functional form of the chaperonin nanomachine.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E4298-E4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Due to the stochastic nature of GroES binding and release, the residence time of SP in the folding cage would vary in this model. Here, we performed a series of biochemical and biophysical experiments to investigate the GroEL/GroES reaction and distinguish between the different models. We find that transient ring separation permits the GroEL rings to function sequentially in SP folding. Ring separation is triggered by ATP binding to the trans ring of the asymmetric GroEL:GroES complex and is concomitant with the dissociation of GroES from the cis ring for SP release. At this point, ring exchange between complexes can occur. A folding-active GroEL mutant with covalently linked rings populated symmetric GroEL:GroES2 complexes. In this mutant, both GroEL chambers function simultaneously. Failure of ring separation in the reaction cycle resulted in delayed release of folded SP and inefficient binding of non-native SP, consistent with the reduced activity of this mutant in vivo. Together, our findings define transient ring separation as an integral step of the sequential GroEL/GroES chaperonin cycle. To distinguish between the two rings of GroEL in the chaperonin cycle, we took advantage of previous reports that GroEL ring hybrids can be produced by incubating wild-type GroEL (EL-WT) with GroEL mutant EL-379 or with GroEL from Thermus thermophilus in the presence of ATP (Burston et al., 1996Burston S.G. Weissman J.S. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Release of both native and non-native proteins from a cis-only GroEL ternary complex.Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, Taguchi et al., 1997Taguchi H. Amada K. Murai N. Yamakoshi M. Yoshida M. ATP-, K+-dependent heptamer exchange reaction produces hybrids between GroEL and chaperonin from Thermus thermophilus.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18155-18160Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). EL-379 carries the mutations Y203E, G337S, and I349E in the apical domain. It is ATPase active but was reported to be unable to bind SP and GroES (Burston et al., 1996Burston S.G. Weissman J.S. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Release of both native and non-native proteins from a cis-only GroEL ternary complex.Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On native-PAGE, the EL-379 double ring migrates more slowly than GroEL, and the mixed ring (MR) complex migrates to an intermediate position (Figure 1C, lanes 1 and 2). We found that MR could not only be generated at 42°C (Burston et al., 1996Burston S.G. Weissman J.S. Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Release of both native and non-native proteins from a cis-only GroEL ternary complex.Nature. 1996; 383: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but also formed efficiently at 25°C (Figure 1C, lanes 1–3). MR formation was ATP-dependent and was not observed when EL-379 was incubated with the GroEL mutant EL-D87K, which does not bind nucleotide (Fenton et al., 1994Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Residues in chaperonin GroEL required for polypeptide binding and release.Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C, lane 4). To verify that MR is composed of distinct rings from GroEL and EL-379, and not of scrambled subunits, we dissociated EL-WT and EL-379 into subunits with 3.5 M urea and then reassembled the subunits in the presence of ATP (Ybarra and Horowitz, 1995Ybarra J. Horowitz P.M. Inactive GroEL monomers can be isolated and reassembled to functional tetradecamers that contain few bound peptides.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22962-22967Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). This resulted in scrambled complexes migrating as multiple bands on native-PAGE between EL-379 and EL-WT (Figure S1B), but not as a distinct band as observed for MR (Figure 1C). Interestingly, when MR was first purified by anion-exchange chromatography (Figure S1C), incubation with ATP resulted in redistribution of the rings to the typical three-band pattern at a molar ratio of EL-WT to MR to EL-379 of 1:2:1 (Figures 1C, lanes 5-6, and 1D). This indicated that the MR complex, once formed, is not a stable entity. Time course experiments showed that MR formation using 1 μM EL-379 and 1 μM EL-WT occurred with an apparent t1/2 of ∼50 s at 25°C (Figures 1E and S1D), i.e., with kinetics comparable to the ATPase rate of GroEL (∼3 rounds of ATP hydrolysis per tetradecamer; Figure S1E). MR formation also occurred at a similar rate in the presence of 30% Ficoll 70 (Figures 1E and S1D), a crowding agent used to mimic the excluded volume effects of the cell cytosol (Zimmerman and Minton, 1993Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Macromolecular crowding: biochemical, biophysical, and physiological consequences.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). These findings indicated that ring separation and exchange can occur during the GroEL ATPase cycle. Next, we tested the nucleotide requirement of ring separation and also analyzed the effect of GroES. MR formation occurred in the presence of ATP but was inefficient with ADP (Figure 1F, lanes 1–3). Note that ADP preparations may contain small amounts of ATP (Hayer-Hartl et al., 1996Hayer-Hartl M.K. Weber F. Hartl F.U. Mechanism of chaperonin action: GroES binding and release can drive GroEL-mediated protein folding in the absence of ATP hydrolysis.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6111-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the additional presence of GroES, ring separation and exchange was observed again only with ATP (Figure 1F, lanes 4 and 5). These reactions were stopped by addition of CDTA, which results in dissociation of GroES from EL-WT (Hayer-Hartl et al., 1995Hayer-Hartl M.K. Martin J. Hartl F.U. Asymmetrical interaction of GroEL and GroES in the ATPase cycle of assisted protein folding.Science. 1995; 269: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The upshift of EL-379 observed in the presence of GroES (Figure 1F, lanes 4 and 5) was due to inefficient GroES dissociation, as confirmed by excision of the band and reanalysis by SDS-PAGE (Figure S1F). This observation, together with the finding that GroES inhibits the EL-379 ATPase by ∼30% (Figure S1E), indicated that the reported defect of EL-379 in GroES binding is only partial. To determine whether ATP binding or hydrolysis is required for ring separation, we used the GroEL mutant EL-D398A, which binds ATP but hydrolyzes it at a very slow rate of less than 2% of EL-WT (Rye et al., 1997Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Distinct actions of cis and trans ATP within the double ring of the chaperonin GroEL.Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent MR formation of EL-D398A with EL-379 (Figure 1G) occurred with the same efficiency as for EL-WT (Figure 1F), suggesting that ATP binding, but not hydrolysis, causes ring separation. Ring separation and exchange was next analyzed in the presence of unfolded SP and GroES. We used SPs varying in size and folding properties: double mutant of maltose-binding protein (DM-MBP; ∼41 kDa) refolds spontaneously with slow kinetics (t1/2 ∼30 min), but the folding intermediate has high affinity for GroEL (Tang et al., 2006Tang Y.C. Chang H.C. Roeben A. Wischnewski D. Wischnewski N. Kerner M.J. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Structural features of the GroEL-GroES nano-cage required for rapid folding of encapsulated protein.Cell. 2006; 125: 903-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), thus allowing chaperonin function to be analyzed at SP saturation (Haldar et al., 2015Haldar S. Gupta A.J. Yan X. Miličić G. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Chaperonin-assisted protein folding: Relative population of asymmetric and symmetric GroEL:GroES complexes.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 2244-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and mitochondrial rhodanese (Rho; ∼33 kDa) and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (mMDH; ∼35 kDa) aggregate upon dilution from denaturant in the absence of GroEL (Martin et al., 1991Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U.

Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Efficient MR formation was observed in all cases (Figure 1H). To determine the step in the GroEL/GroES cycle at which the GroEL rings separate, we used complexes of ADP with metal fluoride or vanadate ion to mimic different states of the γ phosphate along the reaction coordinate of ATP hydrolysis. ADP·BeFx mimics the ATP-bound state, ADP·AlFx mimics the transition state of ATP hydrolysis, and ADP·VO4 mimics the post-hydrolysis state (Chaudhry et al., 2003Chaudhry C. Farr G.W. Todd M.J. Rye H.S. Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B.

Closing the folding chamber of the eukaryotic chaperonin requires the transition state of ATP hydrolysis.Cell. 2003; 113: 369-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the presence of these nucleotide analogs, asymmetric GroEL:GroES complexes form with nucleotides bound in the cis ring (Haldar et al., 2015Haldar S. Gupta A.J. Yan X. Miličić G. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Chaperonin-assisted protein folding: Relative population of asymmetric and symmetric GroEL:GroES complexes.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 2244-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2013Yang D. Ye X. Lorimer G.H. Symmetric GroEL:GroES2 complexes are the protein-folding functional form of the chaperonin nanomachine.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E4298-E4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). No MR formation was observed in the presence of these nucleotides (Figure S1G). Thus, the action of ATP solely in the cis ring of EL-WT apparently does not cause ring separation, suggesting that ATP binding to the trans ring triggers ring separation after ATP hydrolysis in the cis ring. To test this possibility directly, we first generated the asymmetric GroEL:7ADP:GroES complex. Addition of ATP, resulting in ATP binding to the trans ring, triggered ring separation and efficient formation of MR complexes within 10 s (Figure 1I, lanes 1–3). Importantly, MR formation within seconds was also observed upon ATP binding to the ATPase-defective EL-D398A:7ADP:GroES complex (Figure 1I, lanes 4–6). Note that EL-D398A requires ∼40 min to complete one round of ATP hydrolysis (Rye et al., 1997Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Distinct actions of cis and trans ATP within the double ring of the chaperonin GroEL.Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 2013Yang D. Ye X. Lorimer G.H. Symmetric GroEL:GroES2 complexes are the protein-folding functional form of the chaperonin nanomachine.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E4298-E4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, ATP binding to the trans ring of the GroEL:7ADP:GroES complex is the step at which ring separation is triggered (Figure 1J), concomitant with the dissociation of ADP and GroES from the cis ring. The GroEL/GroES ATPase cycle is regulated by a system of nested cooperativity (Gruber and Horovitz, 2016Gruber R. Horovitz A. Allosteric mechanisms in chaperonin machines.Chem. Rev. 2016; 116: 6588-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ATP binds to a GroEL ring with positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient, n = ∼2.8), and there is negative allostery between rings (Figure S2A). Considering that ring separation is triggered by ATP binding to the trans ring, it seemed plausible that negative inter-ring cooperativity was required for this effect. Negative cooperativity is reflected by a small decrease in the ATPase rate from its maximum as the ATP concentration is raised above ∼20 μM (Gruber and Horovitz, 2016Gruber R. Horovitz A. Allosteric mechanisms in chaperonin machines.Chem. Rev. 2016; 116: 6588-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Figure S2A). We tested the efficiency of MR formation with GroEL mutants displaying defects in either positive or negative cooperativity. Mutation D155A converts the ATP-induced intra-ring allosteric transitions from concerted to sequential, reducing positive cooperativity (n = ∼1.5) while preserving negative inter-ring allostery (Danziger et al., 2003Danziger O. Rivenzon-Segal D. Wolf S.G. Horovitz A. Conversion of the allosteric transition of GroEL from concerted to sequential by the single mutation Asp-155 -> Ala.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13797-13802Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Figure S2B). We generated a GroEL mutant essentially lacking positive cooperativity by combining mutations D155A and R197A (Figure S2C). The latter destabilizes one of the inter-subunit salt bridges (R197-E386), reducing positive cooperativity (White et al., 1997White H.E. Chen S. Roseman A.M. Yifrach O. Horovitz A. Saibil H.R. Structural basis of allosteric changes in the GroEL mutant Arg197-->Ala.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The EL-D155A/R197A double mutant nevertheless preserved negative inter-ring cooperativity (Figure S2C). Both EL-D155A and EL-D155A/R197A formed MR complexes in the presence of GroES/ATP with an efficiency similar to EL-WT (Figure 1K), indicating that intra-ring cooperativity is not critical for ring separation. In contrast, mutant EL-E461K had lost the negative inter-ring cooperativity but largely preserved positive intra-ring cooperativity (n = ∼2.3) (Figure S2D). In this mutant, the critical inter-ring salt-bridges (E461-R452 and K105-E434) of the equatorial domains were disrupted, and the two rings were realigned in a 1:1 subunit interaction (Cabo-Bilbao et al., 2006Cabo-Bilbao A. Spinelli S. Sot B. Agirre J. Mechaly A.E. Muga A. Guérin D.M. Crystal structure of the temperature-sensitive and allosteric-defective chaperonin GroELE461K.J. Struct.

A mutant chaperonin with rearranged inter-ring electrostatic contacts and temperature-sensitive dissociation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1128-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). No MR formation was observed with EL-E461K. In conclusion, structural changes underlying negative inter-ring cooperativity of ATP-binding are critical in triggering ring separation. To determine the kinetics of GroEL ring exchange, we established a dual-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (dcFCCS) assay using the apical domain cysteine mutant, EL-E315C, labeled either with the fluorophore Atto 532 (green) or Atto 655 (red) (Haldar et al., 2015Haldar S. Gupta A.J. Yan X. Miličić G. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Chaperonin-assisted protein folding: Relative population of asymmetric and symmetric GroEL:GroES complexes.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 2244-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Equimolar amounts of the labeled proteins (0.5 μM each) were mixed and allowed to undergo ring exchange in the presence of GroES, unfolded DM-MBP, and ATP at 25°C (Figure 2A). MR formation was stopped at different times by addition of apyrase to rapidly hydrolyze ATP, followed by dcFCCS. MR formation occurred with an apparent t1/2 of ∼22 s (Figure 2A). Note that this experimental setup may underestimate the kinetics of ring separation due to the concentration dependence of ring re-association. To obtain the concentration-independent rate of ring dissociation, we incubated preformed MR complexes with excess unlabeled GroEL (plus GroES and unfolded DM-MBP) and monitored the decay of the dcFCCS signal (Figure 2B). ATP-dependent ring separation in ∼70% of the complexes occurred rapidly with a t1/2 of ∼12 s (Figure 2B). The remainder of the complexes showed a slow rate of ring separation, suggesting that a fraction of the labeled MR complexes were not fully functional. The fluorescent-labeled EL-315C hydrolyzed ATP in the presence of GroES and DM-MBP at a rate of ∼50 min−1 (Figure S3), equivalent to successive ATPase cycles in the two GroEL rings being completed in ∼17 s. Thus, ring separation allowing exchange occurs at the timescale of the ATPase reaction.Figure S3ATPase Activity of Fluorescently Labeled GroEL Mutant, Related to Figure 2Show full captionATPases activity of EL-E315C labeled with Atto532 or Atto655 alone, in the presence of GroES or in the presence of GroES and excess non-native DM-MBP.

To understand the functional significance of ring separation, we designed a cysteine mutant of GroEL in which the two rings are covalently coupled via disulfide bonds. In the GroEL crystal structure (PDB: 1XCK), residue Ala109 of helix D in the equatorial domain of each subunit of one ring is in van der Waals contact with Ala109 in a subunit of the opposing ring, having a role in communicating negative inter-ring allostery (Gruber and Horovitz, 2016Gruber R.

The resulting mutant, EL-A109C, readily formed inter-ring disulfide bonds upon expression in E. coli, indicating that the Cys residues are properly positioned for disulfide-bond formation. Disulfide-bonded GroEL-subunit dimers were confirmed by mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE (Figures S4A and S4B). We solved the crystal structure of EL-A109C by molecular replacement at 3.2 Å resolution (Figure 3A and Table S1). The inter-ring disulfide bonds between opposite A109C residues are clearly observed (Figures 3A and 3B). The structure of the disulfide-bonded EL-A109C (henceforth EL-SS) was otherwise essentially identical to EL-WT with an overall root mean square deviation (rmsd) between Cα atoms of 1.128 Å.Figure 3Characterization of EL-A109C Defective in Ring Separation and ExchangeShow full caption(A) Overlay of the crystal structures of disulfide-bonded EL-A109C (EL-SS) and EL-WT (PDB: 1XCK) in orange and aquamarine, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2782629502,"Medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) grid cells fire at regular spatial intervals and project to the hippocampus, where place cells are active in spatially restricted locations. One feature of the grid population is the increase in grid spatial scale along the dorsal-ventral MEC axis. However, the difficulty in perturbing grid scale without impacting the properties of other functionally defined MEC cell types has obscured how grid scale influences hippocampal coding and spatial memory. Here we use a targeted viral approach to knock out HCN1 channels selectively in MEC, causing the grid scale to expand while leaving other MEC spatial and velocity signals intact. Grid scale expansion resulted in place scale expansion in fields located far from environmental boundaries, reduced long-term place field stability and impaired spatial learning. These observations, combined with simulations of a grid-to-place cell model and position decoding of place cells, illuminate how grid scale impacts place coding and spatial memory."

Compelling evidence suggests that natural transmission of prion diseases is mediated by environmental contamination with infectious prions. We hypothesized that several natural and man-made materials, commonly found in the environments of wild and captive animals, can bind prions and may act as vectors for disease transmission. To test our hypothesis, we exposed surfaces composed of various common environmental materials (i.e. wood, rocks, plastic, glass, cement, stainless steel, aluminum, and brass) to hamster-adapted 263K scrapie prions and studied their attachment and retention of infectivity in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicated that these surfaces, with the sole exception of brass, efficiently bind, retain, and release prions. Prion replication was studied in vitro using the protein misfolding cyclic amplification technology, and infectivity of surface-bound prions was analyzed by intracerebrally challenging hamsters with contaminated implants. Our results revealed that virtually all prion-contaminated materials transmitted the disease at high rates. To investigate a more natural form of exposure to environmental contamination, we simply housed animals with large contaminated spheres made of the different materials under study. Strikingly, most of the hamsters developed classical clinical signs of prion disease and typical disease-associated brain changes. Our findings suggest that prion contamination of surfaces commonly present in the environment can be a source of disease transmission, thus expanding our understanding of the mechanisms for prion spreading in nature.

Mitochondrial function relies on genes and RNA species encoded both in the nucleus and mitochondria, and on their coordinated translation, import and respiratory complex assembly. Here, we characterize EXD2 (exonuclease 3'-5' domain-containing 2), a nuclear-encoded gene, and show that it is targeted to the mitochondria and prevents the aberrant association of messenger RNAs with the mitochondrial ribosome. Loss of EXD2 results in defective mitochondrial translation, impaired respiration, reduced ATP production, increased reactive oxygen species and widespread metabolic abnormalities. Depletion of the Drosophila melanogaster EXD2 orthologue (CG6744) causes developmental delays and premature female germline stem cell attrition, reduced fecundity and a dramatic extension of lifespan that is reversed with an antioxidant diet. Our results define a conserved role for EXD2 in mitochondrial translation that influences development and ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2782643336,"Saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate, are elevated in metabolically dysfunctional conditions like type 2 diabetes mellitus. Palmitate has been shown to impair insulin sensitivity and suppress protein synthesis while upregulating proteolytic systems in skeletal muscle. Increased sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response may contribute to the palmitate-induced impairment of muscle protein synthesis. In some cell types, ER stress occurs through activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Given the link between ER stress and suppression of protein synthesis, we investigated whether palmitate induces markers of ER stress and protein synthesis by activating TLR4 in cultured mouse C2C12 myotubes. Myotubes were treated with vehicle, a TLR4-specific ligand (lipopolysaccharides), palmitate, or a combination of palmitate plus a TLR4-specific inhibitor (TAK-242). Inflammatory indicators of TLR4 activation (IL-6 and TNFα) and markers of ER stress were measured, and protein synthesis was assessed using puromycin incorporation. Palmitate substantially increased the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, CHOP, XBP1s, and ATF 4 mRNAs and augmented the levels of CHOP, XBP1s, phospho-PERK and phospho-eIF2α proteins. The TLR4 antagonist attenuated both acute palmitate and LPS-induced increases in IL-6 and TNFα, but did not reduce ER stress signaling with either 6 h or 24 h palmitate treatment. Similarly, treating myotubes with palmitate for 6 h caused a 43% decline in protein synthesis consistent with an increase in phospho-eIF2α, and the TLR4 antagonist did not alter these responses. These results suggest that palmitate does not induce ER stress through TLR4 in muscle, and that palmitate impairs protein synthesis in skeletal muscle in part by induction of ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W2783833381,"Despite the subjective experience of being in full and deliberate control of our actions, our daily routines rely on a continuous and interactive engagement of sensory evaluation and response preparation streams. They unfold automatically and unconsciously and are seamlessly integrated with cognitive control which is mobilized by stimuli that evoke ambiguity or response conflict. Methods with high spatio-temporal sensitivity are needed to provide insight into the interplay between automatic and controlled processing. This study used anatomically-constrained MEG to examine the underlying neural dynamics in a flanker task that manipulated S-R incongruity at the stimulus (SI) and response levels (RI). Though irrelevant, flankers evoked automatic preparation of motor plans which had to be suppressed and reversed following the target presentation on RI trials. Event-related source power estimates in beta (15-25 Hz) frequency band in the sensorimotor cortex tracked motor preparation and response in real time and revealed switching from the incorrectly-primed to the correctly-responding hemisphere. In contrast, theta oscillations (4-7 Hz) were sensitive to the levels of incongruity as the medial and ventrolateral frontal cortices were especially activated by response conflict. These two areas are key to cognitive control and their integrated contributions to response inhibition and switching were revealed by phase-locked co-oscillations. These processes were pharmacologically manipulated with a moderate alcohol beverage or a placebo administered to healthy social drinkers. Alcohol selectively decreased accuracy to response conflict. It strongly attenuated theta oscillations during decision making and partly re-sculpted relative contributions of the frontal network without affecting the motor switching process subserved by beta band. Our results indicate that motor preparation is initiated automatically even when counterproductive but that it is monitored and regulated by the prefrontal cognitive control processes under conflict. They further confirm that the regulative top-down functions are particularly vulnerable to alcohol intoxication."

While those who have experienced interpersonal trauma exhibit more suicidality than those who have experienced non-interpersonal trauma, it is unclear how the traumatic effects are related to an individual’s personality characteristics. This study examined the association between interpersonal trauma and personality factors with suicidality, and elucidated the moderating role of interpersonal trauma in individuals with PTSD. The study included 6,022 participants from the Korean Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study 2011. The Korean Version of Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used for the survey, including the participants’ history of suicidality, the traumas they have experienced, and their PTSD symptoms. The 11-item version of the Big Five Inventory (BFI-11) was used to assess the participants’ personality factors. 76 individuals were diagnosed with PTSD, while 810 had been exposed to trauma but were not diagnosed with any DSM-IV mental disorder. Among the individuals with PTSD, those who had experienced interpersonal trauma were more likely to have suicidal ideation than those who had experienced non-interpersonal trauma (p = .020; odds ratio [OR] = 3.643; 95% confidence interval of OR = [1.226, 10.825]). High agreeableness and conscientiousness predicted less suicidality in those exposed to non-interpersonal trauma, while predicting more suicidality in those exposed to interpersonal trauma. Clinicians examining individuals with PTSD should pay closer attention to the trauma that they have experienced, as well as their personality factors, to provide appropriate treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2784099914,"Objectives In addition to electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), tobacco companies have recently begun to sell heat-not-burn tobacco products, Ploom and iQOS in Japan. Previous research has reported an inverse association between combustible cigarette smoking and educational attainment, but little is known about the association for e-cigarettes, especially heat-not-burn tobacco products. Our objective was to analyze the relationship between educational attainment and e-cigarette and heat-not-burn tobacco use. Setting An internet survey (randomly sampled research agency panelists) in Japan. Participants A total of 7338 respondents aged 18–69 years in 2015 (3632 men and 3706women). Primary measures Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of educational attainment for current smoking (combustible cigarettes), e-cigarette ever-use, and heat-not-burn ever-use were calculated by multivariable logistic regression models using covariates including socio-demographic factors. Stratified analyses according to smoking status (combustible cigarettes) were additionally performed for e-cigarette ever-use and heat-not-burn tobacco product ever-use. Results Associations between educational attainment and e-cigarette ever-use or heat-not-burn tobacco ever-use are not straightforward, although these associations are not statistically significant except for one cell. For example, using ""graduate school"" education as a reference category, adjusted ORs for ""high school"" were 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85–2.44) for e-cigarettes ever-use and 0.75 (95% CI:0.19–2.97) for heat-not-burn tobacco product ever-use. Among current smokers, compared with “graduate school” (reference), those with lower educational attainment showed 0.6 to 0.7 ORs for e-cigarette ever-use: e.g.,""4-year university""(OR = 0.54, 95% CI:0.24–1.24) and ""high school"" (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.30–1.60). Among former smokers, lower education indicated higher ORs for both e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco ever-use. Conclusions This study provides baseline information on educational gradients of e-cigarette and heat-not-burn tobacco products, ever-use. As heat-not-burn tobacco products are increasing their market share in Japan, continuous monitoring of these products will be necessary."

To gain further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this variability, we investigated naturally occurring allelic variations of the myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) gene coding for the influenza restriction factor MxA. The interferon-induced dynamin-like GTPase consists of an N-terminal GTPase domain, a bundle signaling element, and a C-terminal stalk responsible for oligomerization and viral target recognition. We used online databases to search for variations in the MX1 gene. Deploying in vitro approaches, we found that non-synonymous variations in the GTPase domain cause the loss of antiviral and enzymatic activities. Furthermore, we showed that these amino acid substitutions disrupt the interface for GTPase domain dimerization required for the stimulation of GTP hydrolysis. Variations in the stalk were neutral or slightly enhanced or abolished MxA antiviral function. Remarkably, two other stalk variants altered MxA's antiviral specificity. Variations causing the loss of antiviral activity were found only in heterozygous carriers. Interestingly, the inactive stalk variants blocked the antiviral activity of WT MxA in a dominant-negative way, suggesting that heterozygotes are phenotypically MxA-negative. In contrast, the GTPase-deficient variants showed no dominant-negative effect, indicating that heterozygous carriers should remain unaffected.

MxA interferes with different steps of viral replication depending on the virus inhibited. The viral target of MxA antiviral activity against orthomyxo- and bunyaviruses is the nucleoprotein, a component of viral nucleocapsids that encapsidates the viral negative-strand RNA genome (13Kochs G.

In bunyavirus-infected cells, MxA binds and relocates the viral nucleoprotein (N) into perinuclear complexes associated with the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

Our analysis revealed 114 synonymous, 269 missense, and 14 nonsense (stop codon gained) variants, 4 in-frame deletions, 9 frameshifts, and 4 variants located in splice regions (data not shown). Allele frequencies of the variants in MX1 range from 0.00082% (meaning one allele of 121,412) to 52%. However, most variations that change the amino acid sequence of MxA are extremely rare. About half of the missense variants are singletons (variants seen only once in the data set). Two exceptions are the amino acid exchanges G316R in the G domain and V379I in the stalk of MxA, having the highest allele counts of all missense variants (Table 1). Interestingly, most variants are heterozygous. Only for eight missense variants can homozygous carriers be found in the ExAC database. Again, the two missense variants with the highest number of homozygous carriers are G316R and V379I (Table 1).Table 1Selected MxA variants in distinct populations* ExAC (Cambridge, MA) (http://exac.broadinstitute.org) (Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site.).

In total, we analyzed 15 variants in this study, including the two missense variants with the highest allele counts (Table 1). Four variations are located in the G domain (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1), and interestingly, two of them exclusively occur in the Asian population (Table 1). Of the 11 variations located in the stalk (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1), one variation led to a premature stop codon at position 419 and was found only in individuals of African origin with two exceptions (Table 1). We also analyzed one in-frame deletion in the stalk, E516del, and two variants at amino acid positions highly conserved in Mx proteins and dynamin (R408Q and F454C; Fig. S1).

https://openalex.org/W2783555340,"Background Lingual nerve injury or neuropraxia is a rare but potentially serious perioperative complication following airway instrumentation during general anesthesia. This study explored the the incidence and perioperative risk factors for lingual nerve injury in patients receiving laryngeal mask (LMA) or endotracheal (ETGA) general anesthesia in a single center experience. Methods and results All surgical patients in our hospital who received LMA or ETGA from 2009 to 2013 were included, and potential perioperative risk factors were compared. Matched controls were randomly selected (in 1:5 ratio) from the same database in non-case patients. A total of 36 patients in the records had reported experiencing tongue numbness after anesthesia in this study. Compared with the non-case surgical population (n = 54314), patients with tongue numbness were significantly younger (52.2±19.5 vs 42.0±14.5; P = 0.002) and reported lower ASA physical statuses (2.3±0.7 vs 1.6±0.6; P<0.001). Patient gender, anesthesia technique used, and airway device type (LMA or ETGA) did not differ significantly across the two groups. A significantly higher proportion of patients underwent operations of the head-and-neck region (38.9 vs 15.6%; P = 0.002) developed tongue numbness after anesthesia. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that head-and-neck operations remained the most significant independent risk factor for postoperative lingual nerve injury (AOR 7.63; 95% CI 2.03–28.70). Conclusion The overall incidence rate of postoperative lingual neuropraxy was 0.066% in patients receiving general anesthesia with airway device in place. Young and generally healthy patients receiving head-and-neck operation are at higher risk in developing postoperative lingual neuropraxy. Attention should be particularly exercised to reduce the pressure of endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask on the tongue during head-and-neck operation to avert the occurrence of postoperative lingual neuropraxy."
