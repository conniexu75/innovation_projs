https://openalex.org/W2028922610,The corneal lenses preserved in the eyes of some of the Paleozoic trilobites (Arthropoda) are constructed of calcite that is crystallographically oriented to behave like glass. The calcareous lenses are capable of forming inverted images over a large depth of field and must have been present in the living trilobites.

https://openalex.org/W2024193643,Organisms living at depths greater than 5 to 10 cm in marine beaches composed of fine sand are completely anaerobic whenever their particular section of beach is covered by water. Anaerobic conditions are continuous if the slope of the beach is slight enough so that capillary forces keep the sand saturated with water even at low tide.

The activity of enzymes requiring triphosphopyridine nucleotide as a cofactor is increased relative to the control littermates, whereas the activity of those enzymes requiring diphosphopyridine nucleotide is decreased."
