https://openalex.org/W2085397620,"Exercise benefits a variety of organ systems in mammals, and some of the best-recognized effects of exercise on muscle are mediated by the transcriptional co-activator PPAR-γ co-activator-1 α (PGC1-α). Here we show in mouse that PGC1-α expression in muscle stimulates an increase in expression of FNDC5, a membrane protein that is cleaved and secreted as a newly identified hormone, irisin. Irisin acts on white adipose cells in culture and in vivo to stimulate UCP1 expression and a broad program of brown-fat-like development. Irisin is induced with exercise in mice and humans, and mildly increased irisin levels in the blood cause an increase in energy expenditure in mice with no changes in movement or food intake. This results in improvements in obesity and glucose homeostasis. Irisin could be therapeutic for human metabolic disease and other disorders that are improved with exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2093144236,"Most patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) die from progressive disease after relapse, which is associated with clonal evolution at the cytogenetic level. To determine the mutational spectrum associated with relapse, we sequenced the primary tumour and relapse genomes from eight AML patients, and validated hundreds of somatic mutations using deep sequencing; this allowed us to define clonality and clonal evolution patterns precisely at relapse. In addition to discovering novel, recurrently mutated genes (for example, WAC, SMC3, DIS3, DDX41 and DAXX) in AML, we also found two major clonal evolution patterns during AML relapse: (1) the founding clone in the primary tumour gained mutations and evolved into the relapse clone, or (2) a subclone of the founding clone survived initial therapy, gained additional mutations and expanded at relapse. In all cases, chemotherapy failed to eradicate the founding clone. The comparison of relapse-specific versus primary tumour mutations in all eight cases revealed an increase in transversions, probably due to DNA damage caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy. These data demonstrate that AML relapse is associated with the addition of new mutations and clonal evolution, which is shaped, in part, by the chemotherapy that the patients receive to establish and maintain remissions."
https://openalex.org/W2060605982,"Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ETP ALL) is an aggressive malignancy of unknown genetic basis. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 12 ETP ALL cases and assessed the frequency of the identified somatic mutations in 94 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases. ETP ALL was characterized by activating mutations in genes regulating cytokine receptor and RAS signalling (67% of cases; NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, IL7R, JAK3, JAK1, SH2B3 and BRAF), inactivating lesions disrupting haematopoietic development (58%; GATA3, ETV6, RUNX1, IKZF1 and EP300) and histone-modifying genes (48%; EZH2, EED, SUZ12, SETD2 and EP300). We also identified new targets of recurrent mutation including DNM2, ECT2L and RELN. The mutational spectrum is similar to myeloid tumours, and moreover, the global transcriptional profile of ETP ALL was similar to that of normal and myeloid leukaemia haematopoietic stem cells. These findings suggest that addition of myeloid-directed therapies might improve the poor outcome of ETP ALL. This work shows that treatments used for acute myeloid leukaemia and targeted therapies could be used for early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The early T-cell precursor (ETP) subtype of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has a poor prognosis when treated with standard chemotherapy. Whole genome sequencing is used here to gain insights into the genetic basis of the condition. The results reveal a high frequency of activating mutations in genes regulating cytokine receptor and Ras signalling, lesions that disrupt haemopoiesis (many of which arise from chromosomal rearrangements that generate novel chimeric in-frame fusion genes), and inactivating mutations in histone modifying genes. This mutation pattern resembles that of myeloid malignancies, suggesting that myeloid-directed therapies such as high-dose cytarabine, or targeted therapies that inhibit cytokine receptor and JAK signalling, might be effective in ETP ALL."
https://openalex.org/W1992174702,"The proteasome is the major ATP-dependent protease in eukaryotic cells, but limited structural information restricts a mechanistic understanding of its activities. The proteasome regulatory particle, consisting of the lid and base subcomplexes, recognizes and processes polyubiquitinated substrates. Here we used electron microscopy and a new heterologous expression system for the lid to delineate the complete subunit architecture of the regulatory particle from yeast. Our studies reveal the spatial arrangement of ubiquitin receptors, deubiquitinating enzymes and the protein unfolding machinery at subnanometre resolution, outlining the substrate’s path to degradation. Unexpectedly, the ATPase subunits within the base unfoldase are arranged in a spiral staircase, providing insight into potential mechanisms for substrate translocation through the central pore. Large conformational rearrangements of the lid upon holoenzyme formation suggest allosteric regulation of deubiquitination. We provide a structural basis for the ability of the proteasome to degrade a diverse set of substrates and thus regulate vital cellular processes. Determination of the proteasome regulatory particle structure by electron microscopy. In eukaryotes, the ubiquitin–proteasome system is the major pathway for selective protein degradation. The 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome consists of lid and base subcomplexes, and functions in recognition, deubiquitination, unfolding and translocation of substrates into the 20S core particle for proteolysis. The complete subunit architecture of the regulatory particle has now been determined by electron microscopy. The structure provides insights into the potential mechanisms for substrate unfolding and translocation by ATP-dependent proteases into the proteolytic core."
https://openalex.org/W2119087912,"Most known extrasolar planets (exoplanets) have been discovered using the radial velocity or transit methods. Both are biased towards planets that are relatively close to their parent stars, and studies find that around 17-30% (refs 4, 5) of solar-like stars host a planet. Gravitational microlensing, on the other hand, probes planets that are further away from their stars. Recently, a population of planets that are unbound or very far from their stars was discovered by microlensing. These planets are at least as numerous as the stars in the Milky Way. Here we report a statistical analysis of microlensing data (gathered in 2002-07) that reveals the fraction of bound planets 0.5-10 AU (Sun-Earth distance) from their stars. We find that 17(+6)(-9)% of stars host Jupiter-mass planets (0.3-10 M(J), where M(J) = 318 M(⊕) and M(⊕) is Earth's mass). Cool Neptunes (10-30 M(⊕)) and super-Earths (5-10 M(⊕)) are even more common: their respective abundances per star are 52(+22)(-29)% and 62(+35)(-37)%. We conclude that stars are orbited by planets as a rule, rather than the exception."
https://openalex.org/W2038676786,"T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an immature hematopoietic malignancy driven mainly by oncogenic activation of NOTCH1 signaling1. In this study we report the presence of loss-of-function mutations and deletions of the EZH2 and SUZ12 genes, which encode crucial components of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)2,3, in 25% of T-ALLs. To further study the role of PRC2 in T-ALL, we used NOTCH1-dependent mouse models of the disease, as well as human T-ALL samples, and combined locus-specific and global analysis of NOTCH1-driven epigenetic changes. These studies demonstrated that activation of NOTCH1 specifically induces loss of the repressive mark Lys27 trimethylation of histone 3 (H3K27me3)4 by antagonizing the activity of PRC2. These studies suggest a tumor suppressor role for PRC2 in human leukemia and suggest a hitherto unrecognized dynamic interplay between oncogenic NOTCH1 and PRC2 function for the regulation of gene expression and cell transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2142877023,"Retinoblastoma is an aggressive childhood cancer of the developing retina that is initiated by the biallelic loss of RB1. Tumours progress very quickly following RB1 inactivation but the underlying mechanism is not known. Here we show that the retinoblastoma genome is stable, but that multiple cancer pathways can be epigenetically deregulated. To identify the mutations that cooperate with RB1 loss, we performed whole-genome sequencing of retinoblastomas. The overall mutational rate was very low; RB1 was the only known cancer gene mutated. We then evaluated the role of RB1 in genome stability and considered non-genetic mechanisms of cancer pathway deregulation. For example, the proto-oncogene SYK is upregulated in retinoblastoma and is required for tumour cell survival. Targeting SYK with a small-molecule inhibitor induced retinoblastoma tumour cell death in vitro and in vivo. Thus, retinoblastomas may develop quickly as a result of the epigenetic deregulation of key cancer pathways as a direct or indirect result of RB1 loss. The retinoblastoma genome is shown to be stable, but multiple cancer pathways are identified that are epigenetically deregulated, providing potential new therapeutic targets. Retinoblastoma is a rare and aggressive childhood cancer of the retina caused by loss of the RB1 gene. Whole-genome sequencing of four retinoblastomas now shows that the retinoblastoma genome is relatively stable, with a mutational rate among the lowest reported in human cancers and a remarkable lack of mutations in other tumour suppressor/oncogenic pathways. However, RB1 loss is associated with epigenetic deregulation of several cancer pathways. Significantly, the proto-oncogene SYK is upregulated in retinoblastoma and is required for tumour cell survival. A small-molecule inhibitor of SYK induced retinoblastoma tumour cell death in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2031837501,"Two double-sun exoplanets have been discovered by the Kepler spacecraft, establishing a new class of ‘circumbinary’ exoplanets and suggesting that at least several million such systems exist in our Galaxy. The Kepler spacecraft's haul of newly discovered extrasolar planets continues to grow. Most Sun-like stars in the Milky Way are found in gravitationally bound pairs or binaries. The discovery of exoplanet Kepler-16 b showed that planets can exist in orbits around a binary, and now two further such 'circumbinary' planets have been found: Kepler-34 b and Kepler-35 b. Each is a low-density gas giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars. Kepler-34 b orbits two Sun-like stars every 289 days, and Kepler-35 b orbits a pair of smaller stars every 131 days. The observed rate of circumbinary planets implies that 1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearly coplanar orbits, equivalent to a population of at least several million such bodies in the Milky Way. Most Sun-like stars in the Galaxy reside in gravitationally bound pairs of stars1,2 (binaries). Although long anticipated3,4,5,6,7,8, the existence of a ‘circumbinary planet’ orbiting such a pair of normal stars was not definitively established until the discovery9 of the planet transiting (that is, passing in front of) Kepler-16. Questions remained, however, about the prevalence of circumbinary planets and their range of orbital and physical properties. Here we report two additional transiting circumbinary planets: Kepler-34 (AB)b and Kepler-35 (AB)b, referred to here as Kepler-34 b and Kepler-35 b, respectively. Each is a low-density gas-giant planet on an orbit closely aligned with that of its parent stars. Kepler-34 b orbits two Sun-like stars every 289 days, whereas Kepler-35 b orbits a pair of smaller stars (89% and 81% of the Sun’s mass) every 131 days. The planets experience large multi-periodic variations in incident stellar radiation arising from the orbital motion of the stars. The observed rate of circumbinary planets in our sample implies that more than ∼1% of close binary stars have giant planets in nearly coplanar orbits, yielding a Galactic population of at least several million."

https://openalex.org/W2091906004,"Although recent studies indicated that miRNAs regulate plant adaptive responses to nutrient deprivation, the functional significance of miRNAs in adaptive responses to nitrogen (N) limitation remains to be explored. To elucidate the molecular biology underlying N sensing/signaling in maize, we constructed four small RNA libraries and one degradome from maize seedlings exposed to N deficiency. We discovered a total of 99 absolutely new loci belonging to 47 miRNA families by small RNA deep sequencing and degradome sequencing, as well as 9 new loci were the paralogs of previously reported miR169, miR171, and miR398, significantly expanding the reported 150 high confidence genes within 26 miRNA families in maize. Bioinformatic and subsequent small RNA northern blot analysis identified eight miRNA families (five conserved and three newly identified) differentially expressed under the N-deficient condition. Predicted and degradome-validated targets of the newly identified miRNAs suggest their involvement in a broad range of cellular responses and metabolic processes. Because maize is not only an important crop but is also a genetic model for basic biological research, our research contributes to the understanding of the regulatory roles of miRNAs in plant adaption to N-deficiency stress."
https://openalex.org/W1969671165,"MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a), a potent mediator of tumor suppressor p53, has been reported to function as a tumor suppressor and miR-34a was found to be downregulated in prostate cancer tissues. We studied the functional effects of miR-34a on c-Myc transcriptional complexes in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Transfection of miR-34a into PC-3 cells strongly inhibited in vitro cell proliferation, cell invasion and promoted apoptosis. Transfection of miR-34a into PC-3 cells also significantly inhibited in vivo xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. miR-34a downregulated expression of c-Myc oncogene by targeting its 3′ UTR as shown by luciferase reporter assays. miR-34a was found to repress RhoA, a regulator of cell migration and invasion, by suppressing c-Myc–Skp2–Miz1 transcriptional complex that activates RhoA. Overexpression of c-Myc reversed miR-34a suppression of RhoA expression, suggesting that miR-34a inhibits invasion by suppressing RhoA through c-Myc. miR-34a was also found to repress c-Myc-pTEFB transcription elongation complex, indicating one of the mechanisms by which miR-34a has profound effects on cellular function. This is the first report to document that miR-34a suppresses assembly and function of the c-Myc–Skp2–Miz1 complex that activates RhoA and the c-Myc-pTEFB complex that elongates transcription of various genes, suggesting a novel role of miR-34a in the regulation of transcription by c-Myc complex."
https://openalex.org/W2091028498,"Previously we have demonstrated that a Rhodiola crenulata extract (RCE), containing a potent antioxidant salidroside, promotes neurogenesis in the hippocampus of depressive rats. The current study was designed to further investigate the protective effect of the RCE on neurogenesis in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) induced by an intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ), and to determine whether this neuroprotective effect is induced by the antioxidative activity of salidroside. Our results showed that pretreatment with the RCE significantly improved the impaired neurogenesis and simultaneously reduced the oxidative stress in the hippocampus of AD rats. In vitro studies revealed that (1) exposure of neural stem cells (NSCs) from the hippocampus to STZ strikingly increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, induced cell death and perturbed cell proliferation and differentiation, (2) hydrogen peroxide induced similar cellular activities as STZ, (3) pre-incubation of STZ-treated NSCs with catalase, an antioxidant, suppressed all these cellular activities induced by STZ, and (4) likewise, pre-incubation of STZ-treated NSCs with salidroside, also an antioxidant, suppressed all these activities as catalase: reduction of ROS levels and NSC death with simultaneous increases in proliferation and differentiation. Our findings indicated that the RCE improved the impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in the rat model of AD through protecting NSCs by its main ingredient salidroside which scavenged intracellular ROS."
https://openalex.org/W2133447468,"Deforestation in the tropics is an important source of carbon C release to the atmosphere. To provide a sound scientific base for efforts taken to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+) good estimates of C stocks and fluxes are important. We present components of the C balance for selectively logged lowland tropical dipterocarp rainforest in the Malua Forest Reserve of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Total organic C in this area was 167.9 Mg C ha−1±3.8 (SD), including: Total aboveground (TAGC: 55%; 91.9 Mg C ha−1±2.9 SEM) and belowground carbon in trees (TBGC: 10%; 16.5 Mg C ha−1±0.5 SEM), deadwood (8%; 13.2 Mg C ha−1±3.5 SEM) and soil organic matter (SOM: 24%; 39.6 Mg C ha−1±0.9 SEM), understory vegetation (3%; 5.1 Mg C ha−1±1.7 SEM), standing litter (<1%; 0.7 Mg C ha−1±0.1 SEM) and fine root biomass (<1%; 0.9 Mg C ha−1±0.1 SEM). Fluxes included litterfall, a proxy for leaf net primary productivity (4.9 Mg C ha−1 yr−1±0.1 SEM), and soil respiration, a measure for heterotrophic ecosystem respiration (28.6 Mg C ha−1 yr−1±1.2 SEM). The missing estimates necessary to close the C balance are wood net primary productivity and autotrophic respiration. Twenty-two years after logging TAGC stocks were 28% lower compared to unlogged forest (128 Mg C ha−1±13.4 SEM); a combined weighted average mean reduction due to selective logging of −57.8 Mg C ha−1 (with 95% CI −75.5 to −40.2). Based on the findings we conclude that selective logging decreased the dipterocarp stock by 55–66%. Silvicultural treatments may have the potential to accelerate the recovery of dipterocarp C stocks to pre-logging levels."
https://openalex.org/W2010918771,"Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 5 (CHD5) is a newly identified tumor suppressor that is frequently downregulated in a variety of human cancers. Our previous work revealed that the low expression of CHD5 in colorectal cancer is correlated with CHD5 promoter CpG island hypermethylation. In this study, we investigated the effect of microRNA-211 (miR-211)-regulated CHD5 expression on colorectal tumorigenesis.miR-211 was predicted to target CHD5 by TargetScan software analysis. A stably expressing exogenous miR-211 colorectal cancer cell line (HCT-116(miR-211)) was generated using lentiviral transduction and used as a model for in vitro and in vivo studies. The expression level of miR-211 in HCT-116(miR-211) cells was upregulated by 16-fold compared to vector control cells (HCT-116(vector)). Exogenous miR-211 directly binds to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of CHD5 mRNA, resulting in a 50% decrease in CHD5 protein level in HCT-116(miR-211) cells. The levels of cell proliferation, tumor growth, and cell migration of HCT-116(miR-211) cells were significantly higher than HCT-116(vector) cells under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, as determined using the methods of MTT, colony formation, flow cytometry, scratch assay, and tumor xenografts, respectively. In addition, we found that enforced expression of miR-211 in HCT-116 cells was able to alter p53 pathway-associated regulatory proteins, such as MDM2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax.Our results demonstrate that CHD5 is a direct target of miR-211 regulation. Enforced expression of miR-211 promotes tumor cell growth at least in part by downregulating the expression level of the CHD5 tumor suppressor. Our results provide a better understanding of the association of between miR-211-regulated CHD5 expression and CHD5 function in colorectal tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1995084973,"Honey bee colonies are subject to numerous pathogens and parasites. Interaction among multiple pathogens and parasites is the proposed cause for Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), a syndrome characterized by worker bees abandoning their hive. Here we provide the first documentation that the phorid fly Apocephalus borealis, previously known to parasitize bumble bees, also infects and eventually kills honey bees and may pose an emerging threat to North American apiculture. Parasitized honey bees show hive abandonment behavior, leaving their hives at night and dying shortly thereafter. On average, seven days later up to 13 phorid larvae emerge from each dead bee and pupate away from the bee. Using DNA barcoding, we confirmed that phorids that emerged from honey bees and bumble bees were the same species. Microarray analyses of honey bees from infected hives revealed that these bees are often infected with deformed wing virus and Nosema ceranae. Larvae and adult phorids also tested positive for these pathogens, implicating the fly as a potential vector or reservoir of these honey bee pathogens. Phorid parasitism may affect hive viability since 77% of sites sampled in the San Francisco Bay Area were infected by the fly and microarray analyses detected phorids in commercial hives in South Dakota and California's Central Valley. Understanding details of phorid infection may shed light on similar hive abandonment behaviors seen in CCD."

https://openalex.org/W2147267208,"Glucose increases the expression of glycolytic enzymes and other hypoxia-response genes in pancreatic beta-cells. Here, we tested whether this effect results from the activation of Hypoxia-Inducible-factors (HIF) 1 and 2 in a hypoxia-dependent manner.Isolated rat islets and insulin-secreting INS-1E cells were stimulated with nutrients at various pO₂ values or treated with the HIF activator CoCl₂. HIF-target gene mRNA levels and HIF subunit protein levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR, Western Blot and immunohistochemistry. The formation of pimonidazole-protein adducts was used as an indicator of hypoxia. In INS-1E and islet beta-cells, glucose concentration-dependently stimulated formation of pimonidazole-protein adducts, HIF1 and HIF2 nuclear expression and HIF-target gene mRNA levels to a lesser extent than CoCl₂ or a four-fold reduction in pO₂. Islets also showed signs of HIF activation in diabetic Lepr(db/db) but not non-diabetic Lepr(db/+) mice. In vitro, these glucose effects were reproduced by nutrient secretagogues that bypass glycolysis, and were inhibited by a three-fold increase in pO₂ or by inhibitors of Ca²⁺ influx and insulin secretion. In INS-1E cells, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Hif1α and Hif2α, alone or in combination, indicated that the stimulation of glycolytic enzyme mRNA levels depended on both HIF isoforms while the vasodilating peptide adrenomedullin was a HIF2-specific target gene.Glucose-induced O₂ consumption creates an intracellular hypoxia that activates HIF1 and HIF2 in rat beta-cells, and this glucose effect contributes, together with the activation of other transcription factors, to the glucose stimulation of expression of some glycolytic enzymes and other hypoxia response genes."
https://openalex.org/W2013796243,"Certain higher vertebrates developed the ability to reverse muscle cell differentiation (dedifferentiation) as an additional mechanism to regenerate muscle. Mammals, on the other hand, show limited ability to reverse muscle cell differentiation. Myogenic Regulatory Factors (MRFs), MyoD, myogenin, Myf5 and Myf6 are basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors essential towards the regulation of myogenesis. Our current interest is to investigate whether down-regulation of MRFs in terminally differentiated mouse myotubes can induce reversal of muscle cell differentiation. Results from this work showed that reduction of myogenin levels in terminally differentiated mouse myotubes can reverse their differentiation state. Down-regulation of myogenin in terminally differentiated mouse myotubes induces cellular cleavage into mononucleated cells and cell cycle re-entry, as shown by re-initiation of DNA synthesis and increased cyclin D1 and cyclin E2 levels. Finally, we provide evidence that down-regulation of myogenin causes cell cycle re-entry (via down-regulation of MyoD) and cellularisation through separate pathways. These data reveal the important role of myogenin in maintaining terminal muscle cell differentiation and point to a novel mechanism by which muscle cells could be re-activated through its down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2063448708,"Background Despite advances in supportive care, sepsis-related mortality remains high, especially in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Erythropoietin can protect organs against ischemia and sepsis. This effect has been linked to activation of intracellular survival pathways, although the mechanism remains unclear. Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) is an erythropoietin with a unique pharmacologic profile and long half-life. We hypothesized that pretreatment with CERA would be renoprotective in the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis-induced AKI. Methods Rats were randomized into three groups: control; CLP; and CLP+CERA (5 µg/kg body weight, i.p. administered 24 h before CLP). At 24 hours after CLP, we measured creatinine clearance, biochemical variables, and hemodynamic parameters. In kidney tissue, we performed immunoblotting—to quantify expression of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2), aquaporin 2 (AQP2), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)—and immunohistochemical staining for CD68 (macrophage infiltration). Plasma interleukin (IL)-2, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured by multiplex detection. Results Pretreatment with CERA preserved creatinine clearance and tubular function, as well as the expression of NKCC2 and AQP2. In addition, CERA maintained plasma lactate at normal levels, as well as preserving plasma levels of transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase. Renal expression of TLR4 and NF-κB was lower in CLP+CERA rats than in CLP rats (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively), as were CD68-positive cell counts (p<0.01), whereas renal EpoR expression was higher (p<0.05). Plasma levels of all measured cytokines were lower in CLP+CERA rats than in CLP rats. Conclusion CERA protects against sepsis-induced AKI. This protective effect is, in part, attributable to suppression of the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2140414365,"Photosynthesis uses light as a source of energy but its excess can result in production of harmful oxygen radicals. To avoid any resulting damage, phototrophic organisms can employ a process known as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), where excess light energy is safely dissipated as heat. The mechanism(s) of NPQ vary among different phototrophs. Here, we describe a new type of NPQ in the organism Rhodomonas salina, an alga belonging to the cryptophytes, part of the chromalveolate supergroup. Cryptophytes are exceptional among photosynthetic chromalveolates as they use both chlorophyll a/c proteins and phycobiliproteins for light harvesting. All our data demonstrates that NPQ in cryptophytes differs significantly from other chromalveolates – e.g. diatoms and it is also unique in comparison to NPQ in green algae and in higher plants: (1) there is no light induced xanthophyll cycle; (2) NPQ resembles the fast and flexible energetic quenching (qE) of higher plants, including its fast recovery; (3) a direct antennae protonation is involved in NPQ, similar to that found in higher plants. Further, fluorescence spectroscopy and biochemical characterization of isolated photosynthetic complexes suggest that NPQ in R. salina occurs in the chlorophyll a/c antennae but not in phycobiliproteins. All these results demonstrate that NPQ in cryptophytes represents a novel class of effective and flexible non-photochemical quenching."

Therefore, we investigated the associations between IL10 polymorphisms, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, and smoking in noncardia gastric carcinogenesis in Koreans.We genotyped three promoter polymorphisms (-1082A>G, -819T>C, and -592 A>C) of IL10 in a case-control study of 495 noncardia gastric cancer patients and 495 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Multiple logistic regression models were used to detect the effects of IL10 polymorphisms, H. pylori infection, and smoking on the risk of gastric cancer, which was stratified by the histological type of gastric cancer.The IL10-819C and -592C alleles were found to have complete linkage disequilibrium, and all three IL10 polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk of intestinal-type noncardia gastric cancer. These associations were observed only in H. pylori-positive subjects and current smokers. A statistically significant interaction between the IL10-592 genotype and H. pylori infection on the risk of intestinal-type gastric cancer was observed (P for interaction = 0.047). In addition, H. pylori-positive smokers who were carriers of either the IL10-1082G (OR [95% CI] = 17.76 [6.17-51.06]) or the -592C (OR [95% CI] = 8.37 [2.79-25.16]) allele had an increased risk of intestinal-type gastric cancer compared to H. pylori-negative nonsmokers homozygous for IL10-1082A and -592A, respectively. The interaction between the IL10-1082 polymorphism and the combined effects of H. pylori infection and smoking tended towards significance (P for interaction = 0.080).Inflammation-related genetic variants may interact with H. pylori infection and smoking to increase the risk of noncardia gastric cancer, particularly the intestinal-type. These findings may be helpful in identifying individuals at an increased risk for developing noncardia gastric cancer."

These toxic peptides have contributed considerably to the understanding of the structure and functional mechanism of the ion channels (6Dutertre S. Lewis R.J.

Potassium channels blocker toxins (KTx) 6The abbreviations used are: KTxK+ channel toxinHαhydrogen in α positionHβhydrogen in β positionHNamide protonRMSDroot mean square deviationCScystine-stabilized. can be classified into four subfamilies accordingly to the accepted nomenclature: α, β, γ, and κ (9Tytgat J.

Sabatier J.M. Diversity of folds in animal toxins acting on ion channels.Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). β-KTx toxins, known as “long chain,” are three disulfide-bridged peptides with ∼60 amino acids that also contain the cysteine pattern of peptides adopting the CSα/β scaffold, although no structure is available yet (12Diego-García E.

Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). γ-KTxs are blockers of the ether-á-go-go-related gene family of K+ channels; they are 36–47 amino acids long with three or four disulfide bridges, which also adopt the CSα/β scaffold (13Rodríguez de la Vega R.C.

Andreotti N. Jouirou B. Sabatier J.M. Animal toxins acting on voltage-gated potassium channels.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2008; 14: 2503-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is still neither clear whether members of the κ-KTx family might all work through the same mechanism on potassium channels (16Chagot B. Pimentel C. Dai L. Pil J. Tytgat J. Nakajima T. Corzo G.

In part this may be due to the lack of structural and functional characterization of peptides in this family. K+ channel toxin hydrogen in α position hydrogen in β position amide proton root mean square deviation cystine-stabilized. This work describes the native isolation, recombinant production and structural characterization of a newly identified 28 amino acid K+ channel-blocking peptide from Tityus trivittatus venom, named κ-buthitoxin-Tt2b, κ-BUTX-Tt2b for short, following the nomenclature proposal of King et al. (18King G.F. Gentz M.C. Escoubas P. Nicholson G.M. A rational nomenclature for naming peptide toxins from spiders and other venomous animals.Toxicon. 2008; 52: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The sequence shows high identity with peptides classified within the α-KTx subfamily 20 (19Abdel-Mottaleb Y. Coronas F.V. de Roodt A.R. Possani L.D. Tytgat J. A novel toxin from the venom of the scorpion Tityus trivittatus, is the first member of a new alpha-KTX subfamily.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), including the six cysteines of the sequence signature of the CSα/β scaffold. Unexpectedly, the peptide adopts a CSα/α fold in solution. The same overall structure was determined for a recombinant version of another peptide from Tityus serrulatus classified within the same subfamily (UniProt P86271, Ts16 in Ref. 46Bordon, K. C. F., Cologna, C. T., Tytgat, J., Arantes, E. C., (2011) 17th Congress of the European Section of the International Society of Toxinology, Valencia, September 11–15, 2011 (Calvete, J. J., chairman), Poster 128, SOM Ciencia, Valencia, Spain.Google Scholar). Peptides of the α-Ktx subfamily 20 were assumed to adopt the conventional CSα/β scaffold on the basis of their common cysteine spacing. However, both κ-BUTX-Tt2b and Ts16 adopt an unexpected fold even if sharing the cysteine pattern of conventional CSα/β peptides, thus offering new insights on the structural versatility of scorpion venom peptides. Acknowledging this versatility is important if the full potential of animal venoms as natural peptide libraries is to be realized. Venom from the scorpion Tityus trivitattus collected in the Province of Santa Fe, Argentina, was obtained by electrical stimulation and separated as earlier described (20Coronas F.V. de Roodt A.R. Portugal T.O. Zamudio F.Z. Batista C.V. Gómez-Lagunas F. Possani L.D. Disulfide bridges and blockage of Shaker B K+-channels by another butantoxin peptide purified from the Argentinean scorpion Tityus trivittatus.Toxicon. 2003; 41: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Only two steps of HPLC fractionation were necessary to obtain the pure peptide under study. An analytical C18 reverse phase column (Vydac, Hisperia) was used with a linear gradient from solvent A (water in 0.12% TFA, Sigma-Aldrich; all of the chemicals were purchased from this company, unless otherwise specified) to 60% solvent B (acetonitrile in 0.10% TFA), run for 60 min. The second separation used the same system with a gradient from 10 to 35% solvent B, run for 45 min. The amino acid sequence determination of the pure peptide was obtained using automatic Edman degradation with a Beckman LF 3000 protein sequencer, and MS measurements were obtained with an ion-trap equipment from Finnigan LCQDuo as earlier described (20Coronas F.V. de Roodt A.R. Portugal T.O. Zamudio F.Z. Batista C.V. Gómez-Lagunas F. Possani L.D. Disulfide bridges and blockage of Shaker B K+-channels by another butantoxin peptide purified from the Argentinean scorpion Tityus trivittatus.Toxicon. 2003; 41: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The peptide was named κ-buthitoxin-Tt2b. Pure peptide (18 μg) was digested with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin and endopeptidase V8 from Staphylococcus aureus (Roche Applied Science). Initially, 1 μg of trypsin was added in presence of an ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8) and hydrolyzed for 5 h; then the endopeptidase V8 (1 μg) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 12 h at 36 °C. The peptides were separated using the same HPLC conditions used initially for the whole venom (see above) and sequenced. The κ-BUTX-Tt2b synthetic gene coding for the peptide was assembled based on the amino acid sequence obtained and optimized for Escherichia coli codon usage. The κ-BUTX-Tt2b gene (see supplemental data Fig. SM1) was cloned into the expression vector pET32a (Novagen). The resulting plasmid pET32-κ-BUTX-Tt2b was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Ts16 synthetic gene used was based on the κ-BUTX-Tt2b gene (sequence available in supplemental data Fig. SM1). Recombinant-κ-BUTX-Tt2b protein was overexpressed in tuner E. coli cells (Novagen) transformed with the expression vector pET32-κ-BUTX-Tt2b. LB medium supplemented with ampicillin was used to grown cells at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced at an A600 between 0.7–0.8 with isopropyl thio-β-galactopyranoside 0.5 mm. The cells were incubated for 6 h at 30 °C and harvested by centrifugation. For κ-BUTX-Tt2b, the cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml lisozyme, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8) and sonicated using (Misonix Sonicator 3000). The soluble fraction was separated by centrifugation at 32,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Recombinant His6-tagged fusion toxin (20.3 kDa) was purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography using a HiTrap Ni2+ column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with two column volumes of elution buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole). Thrombin was used to release the κ-BUTX-Tt2b recombinant toxin from the N terminus thioredoxin fusion protein. Cleavage reaction was performed for 6 h at 18 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. A second round of isolation by metal-chelate affinity chromatography was required to remove κ-BUTX-Tt2b from cleavage reaction subproducts. Final κ-BUTX-Tt2b purification was performed with reverse phase HPLC in a Pro-Star Varian instrument equipped with a binary gradient solvent system on a Jupiter C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm; Phenomenex) using a linear gradient from 12 to 30% of water-acetonitrile run for 30 min (containing 0.05% TFA) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. MALDI-TOF MS on a Bruker Daltonics Microflex LT equipment was used to determinate the molecular mass of the recombinant proteins. The data were acquired using the reflector operation mode acquiring 150 shots. The samples were prepared with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in a 1:10 ratio (21Gobom J. Schuerenberg M. Mueller M. Theiss D. Lehrach H. Nordhoff E. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid affinity sample preparation. A protocol for MALDI-MS peptide analysis in proteomics.Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). cRNAs for voltage-dependent potassium channels: Shaker-IR (Shaker channel with inactivation domain removed) and hKv1.2 subunits were transcribed using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). cRNAs were injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes using 1–2 ng (in 50 nl) of K+-subunits. Potassium currents were recorded 2–4 days after cRNA injection. The bath solution was ND-96: 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. Resistance for the voltage and current electrodes were 1.0–1.5 and 0.3–0.5 MΩ, respectively, when filled with 3 m KCl. Holding potential was −60 mV, and pulse protocol was applied from −60 mV to +60 mV with increments of 20 mV for 200 ms. Macroscopic currents were recorded using the CA1B high performance oocyte clamp amplifier (Dagan Co.), the Digidata 1440 digitizer, and the pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices). The currents were filtered at ⅕ of the sampling frequency (2 kHz). The volume of washing solution was ∼20 times greater than that of the chamber containing the oocytes. Inhibition was evaluated every minute until steady state was reached, usually from 8 to 10 min. Native and recombinant κ-BUTX-Tt2b were prepared at 0.08 and 2.3 mm concentrations, respectively, by dissolving lyophilized protein in 95% H2O, 5% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). The recombinant protein spectra were obtained at pH 3.5. No pH adjustment was done with the native sample. NMR data were recorded at 25 °C on an 800 MHz Varian spectrometer equipped with a HCN indirect detection probe. TOCSY spectra were recorded with isotropic mixing time of 75 and 20 ms. NOESY spectra were acquired using mixing times of 150 and 300 ms. The two-dimensional NMR spectra were conducted using a scheme of water suppression by gradient-tailored excitation for solvent suppression (22Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. Gradient-tailored excitation for single-quantum NMR spectroscopy of aqueous solutions.J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3522) Google Scholar). All of the experiments were acquired using 2048 and 1024 complex points in direct and indirect dimensions, respectively. Ts16 recombinant protein (rTs16) spectra were recorded in a 500 MHz Varian instrument at 3.0 mm; experiments were obtained as before. NMRDraw and NMRpipe software were used for processing data (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe. A multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11520) Google Scholar). CARA1.5 software was used for NMR data analysis (24Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Semi-automated assignment and distance geometry calculations were performed with CYANA 2.1 (25Güntert P. Automated NMR structure calculation with CYANA.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Structure refinement was performed using molecular dynamics AMBER 9 (26Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. The AMBER biomolecular simulation programs.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6502) Google Scholar) suite with an explicit solvent model. Lowest CYANA target function values were used for further refinement. Molecular dynamics simulations and the energy minimizations were carried out with the topology and parameters of AMBER-99SB force field. Distance and dihedral angle constraints were used for AMBER calculations following the method proposed by Xia et al. (27Xia B. Tsui V. Case D.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Comparison of protein solution structures refined by molecular dynamics simulation in vacuum, with a generalized Born model, and with explicit water.J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Geometric quality of structures was assessed using PROCHECK utility in the validation server of the Protein Data Bank. Fig. 1A shows HPLC separation of the soluble venom from T. trivitattus. The inset shows a second HPLC fractionation, after selecting only the component eluted at 24.7 min from the first run. The major component, labeled with an asterisk (see inset), was the peptide used for this study (∼3.1% of the soluble venom). The amino acid sequence determination of this pure peptide gave an unequivocal sequence assignment up to residue number 27 (Fig. 1B). The last amino acid, Arg in position 28, was inferred by mass spectrometry determination. The experimental mass determined for the native peptide was 3179.75 Da, and the theoretical mass expected for the first 27 residues directly determined was 3023.57, leaving a molecular mass of 156.18, which was identified as being that of arginine. This sequence was deposited in the UniProt Knowledgebase under the accession number B3A0L5. Sequence similarity searches revealed high identity with only two Tityus sp. venom peptides: Ts16 from T. serrulatus (P86271, 89%) and Tt28 from T. trivittatus (P0C183 (18King G.F. Gentz M.C. Escoubas P. Nicholson G.M. A rational nomenclature for naming peptide toxins from spiders and other venomous animals.Toxicon. 2008; 52: 264-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), 65%). No disulfide pairing for any of these homologous peptides has been reported. Fig. 1C shows the profile of HPLC separation after enzymatic hydrolysis. The peptide eluted at 23.0 min was compatible with a disulfide paring between the first (Cys2) and fifth cysteines (Cys24), C1 and C5. The automatic sequencer showed two amino acid residues for the first cycles: Gly and Asn. Position 2 was a blank, but Met was in position 3 and Pro was in position 4. It implies that endopeptidase V8 cleaved the peptide bond at the Glu5, and trypsin cleaved Lys22 and Arg25. The remaining peptides gave always more than two amino acid residues per cycle of the sequencer, because the core fragment of peptide after the enzymatic hydrolysis did not allow separating the other peptides containing the two remaining disulfide bridges. In this way, only one of the disulfide bridges of the toxin was directly determined. Most of the fusion protein was located in the soluble cellular lysate, and it was efficiently retained by the HiTrap Ni2+ column with purification yield of 36 mg/liter. Thrombin recognizes the sequence X3X2R/L—GSX1X2; therefore, the product of the hydrolysis reaction is the κ-BUTX-Tt2b sequence with additional glycine and serine at the N-terminal segment, rκ-BUTX-Tt2b. Optimal cleavage conditions were obtained at 18 °C after 6 h of reaction. Finally, another isolation by metal-chelate affinity chromatography purification step was performed. Under chromatographic conditions selected, rκ-BUTX-Tt2b elutes at 23.0 min with a MALDI-TOF mass of 3325.1 for [M+H]+, which is in good agreement with the theoretical mass of 3323.9 Da for an oxidized peptide forming three disulfide bridges, calculated with the ProtParam tool from ExPASy server (28Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. “Protein Identification and Analysis Tools on the ExPASy Server,”.in: Walker John M. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. 2nd Edition. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2005: 571-607Crossref Google Scholar). The purification procedures indicated above yielded 0.7 mg of rκ-BUTX-Tt2b per liter in LB culture medium. Electrophysiological assays were done on Shaker-IR and hKv1.2 channels. Fig. 2 shows the effect of rκ-BUTX-Tt2b on both channels, using the experimental conditions described below. The protocol of test pulses was applied every 60 s to verify the current stability previous to the toxin addition. Only oocytes showing a minimum run-down were chosen for experimental assays. The control currents (black line) through Shaker-IR or hKv1.2 channels under whole cell recording are plotted. Fig. 2 shows representative traces for both channels only at +60 mV pulse. The addition of rκ-BUTX-Tt2b (200 μmol/liter) blocked partially outward currents (gray line). Recombinant toxin did not change basically the original shape of currents, suggesting that rκ-BUTX-Tt2b acts as a pore blocker, although, further experiments are needed to test this hypothesis. Current reduction was 88.7 ± 9.9 and 74.9 ± 7.1 (n = 3) for Shaker-IR and Kv1.2, respectively. NMR experiments for the κ-BUTX-Tt2b native protein were obtained with poor signal to noise ratio at a very low concentration. The TOCSY experiment was obtained with sufficient sensitivity. However, the NOESY experiments displayed low sensitivity that made difficult to complete the sequential assignments. In contrast, NMR spectroscopic studies using higher concentration of rκ-BUTX-Tt2b revealed well resolved resonances with good chemical shift dispersion between 6.3 and 10.3 ppm. A comparison of the chemical shifts between the amide region signals of the recombinant (black) and the native (red) toxins shows just slight differences mainly caused by different pH levels and concentrations used for the experiments (see Fig. 3). Aliphatic region is almost identical. A NOESY HN region spectrum shows the HN-HN correlations consistent with the presence of helical structures (data not shown). The assignments were achieved following the standard protocol (29Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Wiley, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). All 30 rκ-BUTX-Tt2b spin systems were identified, and most proton resonance signals were unambiguously assigned (chemical shift completeness of 98.7%). The position of the disulfide bridges was established by analyzing the NMR experimental results independently. A NOE signal between Hβ-Hβ from Cys7 and Cys20 (Fig. 3, inset), which corresponds to C2-C4 cystine pair (residue numbers are indicated as in the native protein), was found. Also, there were observed NOE correlations between HN of Cys24 with Hβ of Cys2 and Hβ of Met3; all of these signals are in agreement with the formation of the C1-C5 pair. These results confirm a new cystine pairing for scorpion toxins when compared with the conventional pairs of CSα/β scorpion venom peptides (C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6 (11Mouhat S. Jouirou B. Mosbah A. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M. Diversity of folds in animal toxins acting on ion channels.Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar)). To further support the assigned disulfide bonds, three CYANA calculations were performed with different input parameters following a protocol described by Fadel et al. (30Fadel V. Bettendorff P. Herrmann T. de Azevedo Jr., W.F. Oliveira E.B. Yamane T. Wüthrich K. Automated NMR structure determination and disulfide bond identification of the myotoxin crotamine from Crotalus durissus terrificus.Toxicon. 2005; 46: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The first calculation included data without disulfide bond restrictions. This result provides the NOE constraint contributions for the structure, which was used as a reference. The second calculation was performed using as restrictions the most common disulfide pattern observed in KTxs toxins: C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6. Finally, another set of structures were calculated considering the alternative C1-C5, C2-C4, and C3-C6 cystine pairing pattern, as suggested by the NOE NMR data assignment and mass spectrometry of a digested peptide. Table 1 shows the statistics and RMSD values of these three calculations. After comparison of backbone for the residues 3–30 of the lowest energy structure for each set of calculations, the RMSD against the reference structure gave 1.75 Å for the conventional disulfide bridges and 0.78 Å for the nonconventional disulfide bridges.TABLE 1RMSD between 20 CYANA calculated structures for κ-BUTX-Tt2b varying the disulfide bridge patternsκ-BUTX-Tt2bNo DSBcDSBnDSBUpper distance limits Total367342365 Short range228221223 Medium range645564 Long range756678RMSD (3–30) Average backbone (Å)0.430.520.39 Average heavy atom (Å)1.091.191.01 Target function value (Å)0.00.080.01 Open table in a new tab A total of 200 structures where generated with CYANA; only 20 structures (Fig. 4A) with the lowest target function are"
https://openalex.org/W2025116182,"γ-Tubulin is the key protein for microtubule nucleation. Duplication of the γ-tubulin gene occurred several times during evolution, and in mammals γ-tubulin genes encode proteins which share ∼97% sequence identity. Previous analysis of Tubg1 and Tubg2 knock-out mice has suggested that γ-tubulins are not functionally equivalent. Tubg1 knock-out mice died at the blastocyst stage, whereas Tubg2 knock-out mice developed normally and were fertile. It was proposed that γ-tubulin 1 represents ubiquitous γ-tubulin, while γ-tubulin 2 may have some specific functions and cannot substitute for γ-tubulin 1 deficiency in blastocysts. The molecular basis of the suggested functional difference between γ-tubulins remains unknown. Here we show that exogenous γ-tubulin 2 is targeted to centrosomes and interacts with γ-tubulin complex proteins 2 and 4. Depletion of γ-tubulin 1 by RNAi in U2OS cells causes impaired microtubule nucleation and metaphase arrest. Wild-type phenotype in γ-tubulin 1-depleted cells is restored by expression of exogenous mouse or human γ-tubulin 2. Further, we show at both mRNA and protein levels using RT-qPCR and 2D-PAGE, respectively, that in contrast to Tubg1, the Tubg2 expression is dramatically reduced in mouse blastocysts. This indicates that γ-tubulin 2 cannot rescue γ-tubulin 1 deficiency in knock-out blastocysts, owing to its very low amount. The combined data suggest that γ-tubulin 2 is able to nucleate microtubules and substitute for γ-tubulin 1. We propose that mammalian γ-tubulins are functionally redundant with respect to the nucleation activity."
https://openalex.org/W2090449180,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by vascular thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity in the presence of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Different pathogenic mechanisms for aPL-mediated pregnancy failure have been proposed. In particular a direct effect of aPL on both maternal and fetal side of the placental tissue has been reported, since their reactivity with β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) makes them adhere to trophoblast and human endometrial endothelial cell (HEEC) membranes. β2GPI can be recognized by aPL that, once bound, interfere with both trophoblast functions and with the HEEC differentiation. APS patients can be successfully treated with Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH). Recent reports suggest that LMWH acts through mechanisms alternative to its well known anticoagulant effect, because of its ability to bind β2GPI. In our previous studies, we showed that LMWH is able to reduce the aPL binding to trophoblasts and restore cell invasiveness and differentiation. So far, however, no study has described its effects on endometrial angiogenesis. The aim of our research was to evaluate whether two LMWHs, tinzaparin and enoxaparin, have an effect on the aPL-inhibited endometrial angiogenesis. This prompted us to investigate: (i) in vitro HEEC angiogenesis through a Matrigel assay; (ii) VEGF secretion by ELISA; (iii) matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity by gelatin zymography; (iv) Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) DNA binding activity by colorimetric assay; (v) STAT-3 activation by a sandwich-ELISA kit. Furthermore, using an in vivo murine model we investigated the LMWHs effects on angiogenesis. We demonstrated that the addition of LMWHs prevents aPL-inhibited HEEC angiogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo, and is able to restore the aPL inhibited NF-κB and/or STAT-3 activity, the VEGF secretion and the MMPs activity. The demonstration of a beneficial role for LMWHs on the aPL-inhibited HEEC angiogenesis might provide additional mechanisms whereby this treatment protects early pregnancy in APS."
https://openalex.org/W2160495156,"It has recently been discovered that Collagen III, the encoded protein of the type IV Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) gene, is one of the major constituents of the pial basement membrane (BM) and serves as the ligand for GPR56. Mutations in GPR56 cause a severe human brain malformation called bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria, in which neurons transmigrate through the BM causing severe mental retardation and frequent seizures. To further characterize the brain phenotype of Col3a1 knockout mice, we performed a detailed histological analysis. We observed a cobblestone-like cortical malformation, with BM breakdown and marginal zone heterotopias in Col3a1⁻/⁻ mouse brains. Surprisingly, the pial BM appeared intact at early stages of development but starting as early as embryonic day (E) 11.5, prominent BM defects were observed and accompanied by neuronal overmigration. Although collagen III is expressed in meningeal fibroblasts (MFs), Col3a1⁻/⁻ MFs present no obvious defects. Furthermore, the expression and posttranslational modification of α-dystroglycan was undisturbed in Col3a1⁻/⁻ mice. Based on the previous finding that mutations in COL3A1 cause type IV EDS, our study indicates a possible common pathological pathway linking connective tissue diseases and brain malformations."
https://openalex.org/W1967522589,"Background Studies have observed an association between the ABO blood group and risk of certain malignancies. However, no studies of the association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk are available. We conducted this hospital-based case-control study to examine the association with HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Methods From January 2004 to December 2008, a total of 6275 consecutive eligible patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were recruited. 1105 of them were patients with HBV-related HCC and 5,170 patients were CHB without HCC. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between the ABO blood group and HCC risk. Results Compared with subjects with blood type O, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for the association of those with blood type A and HCC risk was 1.39 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05–1.83] after adjusting for age, sex, type 2 diabetes, cirrhosis, hepatitis B e antigen, and HBV DNA. The associations were only statistically significant [AOR (95%CI) = 1.56(1.14–2.13)] for men, for being hepatitis B e antigen positive [AOR (95%CI) = 4.92(2.83–8.57)], for those with cirrhosis [AOR (95%CI), 1.57(1.12–2.20)], and for those with HBV DNA≤105copies/mL [AOR (95%CI), 1.58(1.04–2.42)]. Stratified analysis by sex indicated that compared with those with blood type O, those with blood type B also had a significantly high risk of HCC among men, whereas, those with blood type AB or B had a low risk of HCC among women. Conclusions The ABO blood type was associated with the risk of HCC in Chinese patients with CHB. The association was gender-related."
https://openalex.org/W1975017676,"Leaf characters have been successfully utilized to classify Camellia (Theaceae) species; however, leaf characters combined with supervised pattern recognition techniques have not been previously explored. We present results of using leaf morphological and venation characters of 93 species from five sections of genus Camellia to assess the effectiveness of several supervised pattern recognition techniques for classifications and compare their accuracy. Clustering approach, Learning Vector Quantization neural network (LVQ-ANN), Dynamic Architecture for Artificial Neural Networks (DAN2), and C-support vector machines (SVM) are used to discriminate 93 species from five sections of genus Camellia (11 in sect. Furfuracea, 16 in sect. Paracamellia, 12 in sect. Tuberculata, 34 in sect. Camellia, and 20 in sect. Theopsis). DAN2 and SVM show excellent classification results for genus Camellia with DAN2's accuracy of 97.92% and 91.11% for training and testing data sets respectively. The RBF-SVM results of 97.92% and 97.78% for training and testing offer the best classification accuracy. A hierarchical dendrogram based on leaf architecture data has confirmed the morphological classification of the five sections as previously proposed. The overall results suggest that leaf architecture-based data analysis using supervised pattern recognition techniques, especially DAN2 and SVM discrimination methods, is excellent for identification of Camellia species."
https://openalex.org/W2019368209,"Inhibitory interneurons in the cerebellar granular layer are more heterogeneous than traditionally depicted. In contrast to Golgi cells, which are ubiquitously distributed in the granular layer, small fusiform Lugaro cells and globular cells are located underneath the Purkinje cell layer and small in number. Globular cells have not been characterized physiologically. Here, using cerebellar slices obtained from a strain of gene-manipulated mice expressing GFP specifically in GABAergic neurons, we morphologically identified globular cells, and compared their synaptic activity and monoaminergic influence of their electrical activity with those of small Golgi cells and small fusiform Lugaro cells. Globular cells were characterized by prominent IPSCs together with monosynaptic inputs from the axon collaterals of Purkinje cells, whereas small Golgi cells or small fusiform Lugaro cells displayed fewer and smaller spontaneous IPSCs. Globular cells were silent at rest and fired spike discharges in response to application of either serotonin (5-HT) or noradrenaline. The two monoamines also facilitated small Golgi cell firing, but only 5-HT elicited firing in small fusiform Lugaro cells. Furthermore, globular cells likely received excitatory monosynaptic inputs through mossy fibers. Because globular cells project their axons long in the transversal direction, the neuronal circuit that includes interplay between Purkinje cells and globular cells could regulate Purkinje cell activity in different microzones under the influence of monoamines and mossy fiber inputs, suggesting that globular cells likely play a unique modulatory role in cerebellar motor control."
https://openalex.org/W1964655065,"Simian virus 40 (SV40) is a powerful tool to study cellular transformation in vitro, as well as tumor development and progression in vivo. Various cellular kinases, among them members of the CK1 family, play an important role in modulating the transforming activity of SV40, including the transforming activity of T-Ag, the major transforming protein of SV40, itself. Here we characterized the effects of mutant CK1δ variants with impaired kinase activity on SV40-induced cell transformation in vitro, and on SV40-induced mammary carcinogenesis in vivo in a transgenic/bi-transgenic mouse model. CK1δ mutants exhibited a reduced kinase activity compared to wtCK1δ in in vitro kinase assays. Molecular modeling studies suggested that mutation N172D, located within the substrate binding region, is mainly responsible for impaired mutCK1δ activity. When stably over-expressed in maximal transformed SV-52 cells, CK1δ mutants induced reversion to a minimal transformed phenotype by dominant-negative interference with endogenous wtCK1δ. To characterize the effects of CK1δ on SV40-induced mammary carcinogenesis, we generated transgenic mice expressing mutant CK1δ under the control of the whey acidic protein (WAP) gene promoter, and crossed them with SV40 transgenic WAP-T-antigen (WAP-T) mice. Both WAP-T mice as well as WAP-mutCK1δ/WAP-T bi-transgenic mice developed breast cancer. However, tumor incidence was lower and life span was significantly longer in WAP-mutCK1δ/WAP-T bi-transgenic animals. The reduced CK1δ activity did not affect early lesion formation during tumorigenesis, suggesting that impaired CK1δ activity reduces the probability for outgrowth of in situ carcinomas to invasive carcinomas. The different tumorigenic potential of SV40 in WAP-T and WAP-mutCK1δ/WAP-T tumors was also reflected by a significantly different expression of various genes known to be involved in tumor progression, specifically of those involved in wnt-signaling and DNA repair. Our data show that inactivating mutations in CK1δ impair SV40-induced cellular transformation in vitro and mouse mammary carcinogenesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2082832909,"Genetics of the variability of normal and diseased brain structure largely remains to be elucidated. Expansions of certain trinucleotide repeats cause neurodegenerative disorders of which Huntington's disease constitutes the most common example. Here, we test the hypothesis that variation within the IT15 gene on chromosome 4, whose expansion causes Huntington's disease, influences normal human brain structure. In 278 normal subjects, we determined CAG repeat length within the IT15 gene on chromosome 4 and analyzed high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images by the use of voxel-based morphometry. We found an increase of GM with increasing long CAG repeat and its interaction with age within the pallidum, which is involved in Huntington's disease. Our study demonstrates that a certain trinucleotide repeat influences normal brain structure in humans. This result may have important implications for the understanding of both the healthy and diseased brain."
https://openalex.org/W2085416508,"Identifying external factors that can be used to control neural stem cells division and their differentiation to neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes is of high scientific and clinical interest. Here we show that the Nogo-66 receptor interacting protein LINGO-1 is a potent regulator of neural stem cell maturation to neurons. LINGO-1 is expressed by cortical neural stem cells from E14 mouse embryos and inhibition of LINGO-1 during the first days of neural stem cell differentiation results in decreased neuronal maturation. Compared to neurons in control cultures, which after 6 days of differentiation have long extending neurites, neurons in cultures treated with anti-LINGO-1 antibodies retain an immature, round phenotype with only very short processes. Furthermore, neutralization of LINGO-1 results in a threefold increase in βIII tubulin-positive cells compared to untreated control cultures. By using BrdU incorporation assays we show that the immature neurons in LINGO-1 neutralized cultures are dividing neuroblasts. In contrast to control cultures, in which no cells were double positive for βIII tubulin and BrdU, 36% of the neurons in cultures treated with anti-LINGO-1 antibodies were proliferating after three days of differentiation. TUNEL assays revealed that the amount of cells going through apoptosis during the early phase of differentiation was significantly decreased in cultures treated with anti-LINGO-1 antibodies compared to untreated control cultures. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel role for LINGO-1 in neural stem cell differentiation to neurons and suggest a possibility to use LINGO-1 inhibitors to compensate for neuronal cell loss in the injured brain."

https://openalex.org/W1991961033,"This study examines the IL-11 mediated activation of downstream signaling and expression of effector molecules to resolve the controversies associated with the IL-11 mediated regulation of the invasiveness of two commonly used trophoblastic cell models viz. JEG-3 and HTR-8/SVneo cells. It has been reported that IL-11 increases the invasiveness of JEG-3 cells while, reduces the invasiveness of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Invasion assay performed simultaneously for both the cell lines confirmed the above findings. In addition, HTR-8/SVneo cells showed a higher basal invasiveness than JEG-3 cells. Western blot showed the IL-11 mediated activation of STAT3(tyr705) and STAT1(tyr701) in both the cell lines. However, IL-11 activated the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in JEG-3 cells but, inhibited it in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Within 10 min of IL-11 treatment, p-STAT3(tyr705) was localized inside the nucleus of both the cell lines but, there was enhanced co-localization of protein inhibitor of activated STAT1/3 (PIAS1/3) and p-STAT3(tyr705) in HTR-8/SVneo cells and not in JEG-3 cells. This could be reason for the poor responsiveness of STAT3 responsive genes like mucin 1 (MUC1) in HTR-8/SVneo cells and not in JEG-3 cells. Further, microarray analysis of the IL-11 treated cells revealed differential responsiveness of JEG-3 as compared to HTR-8/SVneo cells. Several family of genes like activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors (Jun and Fos), mucin-type molecules, MMP23B etc showed enhanced expression in IL-11 treated JEG-3 cells while, there was no response or decrease in their expression in IL-11 treated HTR-8/SVneo cells. Expression of these molecules was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. In addition, HTR-8/SVneo cells also showed a significant decrease in the expression of MMP2, MMP3 and MMP9 upon IL-11 treatment. Hence, IL-11 mediated differential activation of signaling and expression of effector molecules is responsible for the differential invasive response of JEG-3 and HTR-8/SVneo cells."
https://openalex.org/W2044871695,"The Taylorella genus comprises two species: Taylorella equigenitalis, which causes contagious equine metritis, and Taylorella asinigenitalis, a closely-related species mainly found in donkeys. We herein report on the first genome sequence of T. asinigenitalis, analyzing and comparing it with the recently-sequenced T. equigenitalis genome. The T. asinigenitalis genome contains a single circular chromosome of 1,638,559 bp with a 38.3% GC content and 1,534 coding sequences (CDS). While 212 CDSs were T. asinigenitalis-specific, 1,322 had orthologs in T. equigenitalis. Two hundred and thirty-four T. equigenitalis CDSs had no orthologs in T. asinigenitalis. Analysis of the basic nutrition metabolism of both Taylorella species showed that malate, glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate may be their main carbon and energy sources. For both species, we identified four different secretion systems and several proteins potentially involved in binding and colonization of host cells, suggesting a strong potential for interaction with their host. T. equigenitalis seems better-equipped than T. asinigenitalis in terms of virulence since we identified numerous proteins potentially involved in pathogenicity, including hemagluttinin-related proteins, a type IV secretion system, TonB-dependent lactoferrin and transferrin receptors, and YadA and Hep_Hag domains containing proteins. This is the first molecular characterization of Taylorella genus members, and the first molecular identification of factors potentially involved in T. asinigenitalis and T. equigenitalis pathogenicity and host colonization. This study facilitates a genetic understanding of growth phenotypes, animal host preference and pathogenic capacity, paving the way for future functional investigations into this largely unknown genus."
https://openalex.org/W2155472936,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2α) is a signaling adaptor protein that regulates downstream signaling of many receptor tyrosine kinases. During signal transduction, FRS2 can be both tyrosine and threonine phosphorylated and forms signaling complexes with other adaptor proteins and tyrosine phosphatases. We have here identified flotillin-1 and the cbl-associated protein/ponsin (CAP) as novel interaction partners of FRS2. Flotillin-1 binds to the phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB) of FRS2 and competes for the binding with the fibroblast growth factor receptor. Flotillin-1 knockdown results in increased Tyr phosphorylation of FRS2, in line with the inhibition of ERK activity in the absence of flotillin-1. CAP directly interacts with FRS2 by means of its sorbin homology (SoHo) domain, which has previously been shown to interact with flotillin-1. In addition, the third SH3 domain in CAP binds to FRS2. Due to the overlapping binding domains, CAP and flotillin-1 appear to compete for the binding to FRS2. Thus, our results reveal a novel signaling network containing FRS2, CAP and flotillin-1, whose successive interactions are most likely required to regulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, especially the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2066238445,"Delayed wound healing is one of the most common secondary adverse effects associated to the therapeutic use of glucocorticoid (GC) analogs, which act through the ligand-dependent transcription factor GC-receptor (GR). GR function is exerted through DNA-binding-dependent and –independent mechanisms, classically referred to as transactivation (TA) and transrepression (TR). Currently both TA and TR are thought to contribute to the therapeutical effects mediated by GR; however their relative contribution to unwanted side effects such as delayed wound healing is unknown. We evaluated skin wound healing in transgenic mice with keratinocyte-restricted expression of either wild type GR or a mutant GR that is TA-defective but efficient in TR (K5-GR and K5-GR-TR mice, respectively). Our data show that at days (d) 4 and 8 following wounding, healing in K5-GR mice was delayed relative to WT, with reduced recruitment of granulocytes and macrophages and diminished TNF-α and IL-1β expression. TGF-β1 and Kgf expression was repressed in K5-GR skin whereas TGF-β3 was up-regulated. The re-epithelialization rate was reduced in K5-GR relative to WT, as was formation of granulation tissue. In contrast, K5-GR-TR mice showed delays in healing at d4 but re-established the skin breach at d8 concomitant with decreased repression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors relative to K5-GR mice. Keratinocytes from both transgenic mice closed in vitro wounds slower relative to WT, consistent with the in vivo defects in cell migration. Overall, the delay in the early stages of wound healing in both transgenic models is similar to that elicited by systemic treatment with dexamethasone. Wound responses in the transgenic keratinocytes correlated with reduced ERK activity both in vivo and in vitro. We conclude that the TR function of GR is sufficient for negatively regulating early stages of wound closure, while TA by GR is required for delaying later stages of healing."
https://openalex.org/W2093387424,"In a previous study, we detected the presence of a Mycobacterium avium species-specific insertion sequence, IS1245, in Mycobacterium kansasii. Both species were isolated from a mixed M. avium-M. kansasii bone marrow culture from an HIV-positive patient. The transfer mechanism of this insertion sequence to M. kansasii was investigated here.A linear plasmid (pMA100) was identified in all colonies isolated from the M. avium-M. kansasii mixed culture carrying the IS1245 element. The linearity of pMA100 was confirmed. Other analyses suggested that pMA100 contained a covalently bound protein in the terminal regions, a characteristic of invertron linear replicons. Partial sequencing of pMA100 showed that it bears one intact copy of IS1245 inserted in a region rich in transposase-related sequences. These types of sequences have been described in other linear mycobacterial plasmids. Mating experiments were performed to confirm that pMA100 could be transferred in vitro from M. avium to M. kansasii. pMA100 was transferred by in vitro conjugation not only to the M. kansasii strain from the mixed culture, but also to two other unrelated M. kansasii clinical isolates, as well as to Mycobacterium bovis BCG Moreau.Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is one of most important mechanisms leading to the evolution and diversity of bacteria. This work provides evidence for the first time on the natural occurrence of HGT between different species of mycobacteria.

https://openalex.org/W1967428449,"Background Bone metastasis is a main cause of morbidity in breast cancer. Since breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, the interactions of cancer cells with the skeletal host cells might also be diverse. We hypothesized that gene expression signatures induced by heterotypic interaction of breast cancer cells and osteoblasts might be of clinical relevance. Methodology/Principal Findings We established an ex vivo co-culture model using benign breast epithelial cells or a panel of 5 malignant breast epithelial cells in combination with primary human osteoblasts and determined associated gene expression changes with HEEBO microarrays. Pretreatment gene expression profiles of 295 early stage breast cancers published from the Netherlands Cancer Institute with a median follow up of 12.6 years allowed evaluating in vitro effects in the in vivo situation.The effects of the interaction between osteoblasts and breast cancer cell lines of different origin were very heterogeneous. Hs578T cells started to proliferate in co-culture with osteoblasts, SKBR-3 induced a TGF-β response and MDA-MB231 cells showed two distinct sets of up-regulated genes: A set of interferon response genes associated with an up-regulation of STAT1 was in vivo remarkably coherent providing a basis for segregation of tumors into two groups. In a uni-variate analysis, early stage tumors with high expression levels (n = 136) of this gene set had a significantly lower overall survival rate (p = 0.005) (63% at 10 years) than tumors with low expression levels (n = 159) (overall survival: 77% at 10 years). The second gene set was associated with IL-6 and did not significantly change the overall survival rate (p = 0.165), but was significantly associated with a shorter time to bone metastasis (p = 0.049; 74% vs. 83% at 10 years). Conclusion/Significance An IL-6 gene expression pattern induced by heterotypic interaction of breast cancer cells with osteoblasts in vitro is associated with a higher rate of bone metastasis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1966315353,"Derived sabercats had craniomandibular morphologies that in many respects were highly different from those of extant felids, and this has often been interpreted functionally as adaptations for predation at extreme gape angles with hypertrophied upper canines. It is unknown how much of this was a result of intraspecific postnatal ontogeny, since juveniles of sabercats are rare and no quantitative study has been made of craniomandibular ontogeny. Postnatal ontogenetic craniomandibular shape changes in two morphologically derived sabercats, Smilodon fatalis and S. populator, were analysed using geometric morphometrics and compared to three species of extant pantherines, the jaguar, tiger, and Sunda clouded leopard. Ontogenetic shape changes in Smilodon usually involved the same areas of the cranium and mandible as in extant pantherines, and large-scale modularization was similar, suggesting that such may have been the case for all felids, since it followed the same trends previously observed in other mammals. However, in other respects Smilodon differed from extant pantherines. Their crania underwent much greater and more localised ontogenetic shape changes than did the mandibles, whereas crania and mandibles of extant pantherines underwent smaller, fewer and less localised shape changes. Ontogenetic shape changes in the two species of Smilodon are largely similar, but differences are also present, notably those which may be tied to the presence of larger upper canines in S. populator. Several of the specialized cranial characters differentiating adult Smilodon from extant felids in a functional context, which are usually regarded as evolutionary adaptations for achieving high gape angles, are ontogenetic, and in several instances ontogeny appears to recapitulate phylogeny to some extent. No such ontogenetic evolutionary adaptive changes were found in the extant pantherines. Evolution in morphologically derived sabercats involved greater cranial ontogenetic changes than among extant felids, resulting in greatly modified adult craniomandibular morphologies."
https://openalex.org/W2031069500,"Background Hundreds of genes with differential DNA methylation of promoters have been identified for various cancers. However, the reproducibility of differential DNA methylation discoveries for cancer and the relationship between DNA methylation and aberrant gene expression have not been systematically analysed. Methodology/Principal Findings Using array data for seven types of cancers, we first evaluated the effects of experimental batches on differential DNA methylation detection. Second, we compared the directions of DNA methylation changes detected from different datasets for the same cancer. Third, we evaluated the concordance between methylation and gene expression changes. Finally, we compared DNA methylation changes in different cancers. For a given cancer, the directions of methylation and expression changes detected from different datasets, excluding potential batch effects, were highly consistent. In different cancers, DNA hypermethylation was highly inversely correlated with the down-regulation of gene expression, whereas hypomethylation was only weakly correlated with the up-regulation of genes. Finally, we found that genes commonly hypomethylated in different cancers primarily performed functions associated with chronic inflammation, such as ‘keratinization’, ‘chemotaxis’ and ‘immune response’. Conclusions Batch effects could greatly affect the discovery of DNA methylation biomarkers. For a particular cancer, both differential DNA methylation and gene expression can be reproducibly detected from different studies with no batch effects. While DNA hypermethylation is significantly linked to gene down-regulation, hypomethylation is only weakly correlated with gene up-regulation and is likely to be linked to chronic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2055293915,"DYRK-family kinases employ an intramolecular mechanism to autophosphorylate a critical tyrosine residue in the activation loop. Once phosphorylated, DYRKs lose tyrosine kinase activity and function as serine/threonine kinases. DYRKs have been characterized in organisms from yeast to human; however, all entities belong to the Unikont supergroup, only one of five eukaryotic supergroups. To assess the evolutionary age and conservation of the DYRK intramolecular kinase-activation mechanism, we surveyed 21 genomes representing four of the five eukaryotic supergroups for the presence of DYRKs. We also analyzed the activation mechanism of the sole DYRK (class 2 DYRK) present in Trypanosoma brucei (TbDYRK2), a member of the excavate supergroup and separated from Drosophila by ∼850 million years. Bioinformatics showed the DYRKs clustering into five known subfamilies, class 1, class 2, Yaks, HIPKs and Prp4s. Only class 2 DYRKs were present in all four supergroups. These diverse class 2 DYRKs also exhibited conservation of N-terminal NAPA regions located outside of the kinase domain, and were shown to have an essential role in activation loop autophosphorylation of Drosophila DmDYRK2. Class 2 TbDYRK2 required the activation loop tyrosine conserved in other DYRKs, the NAPA regions were critical for this autophosphorylation event, and the NAPA-regions of Trypanosoma and human DYRK2 complemented autophosphorylation by the kinase domain of DmDYRK2 in trans. Finally, sequential deletion analysis was used to further define the minimal region required for trans-complementation. Our analysis provides strong evidence that class 2 DYRKs were present in the primordial or root eukaryote, and suggest this subgroup may be the oldest, founding member of the DYRK family. The conservation of activation loop autophosphorylation demonstrates that kinase self-activation mechanisms are also primitive."
https://openalex.org/W2148413088,"Objective Develop a simple method for optimal estimation of HIV incidence using the BED capture enzyme immunoassay. Design Use existing BED data to estimate mean recency duration, false recency rates and HIV incidence with reference to a fixed time period, T. Methods Compare BED and cohort estimates of incidence referring to identical time frames. Generalize this approach to suggest a method for estimating HIV incidence from any cross-sectional survey. Results Follow-up and BED analyses of the same, initially HIV negative, cases followed over the same set time period T, produce estimates of the same HIV incidence, permitting the estimation of the BED mean recency period for cases who have been HIV positive for less than T. Follow-up of HIV positive cases over T, similarly, provides estimates of the false-recent rate appropriate for T. Knowledge of these two parameters for a given population allows the estimation of HIV incidence during T by applying the BED method to samples from cross-sectional surveys. An algorithm is derived for providing these estimates, adjusted for the false-recent rate. The resulting estimator is identical to one derived independently using a more formal mathematical analysis. Adjustments improve the accuracy of HIV incidence estimates. Negative incidence estimates result from the use of inappropriate estimates of the false-recent rate and/or from sampling error, not from any error in the adjustment procedure. Conclusions Referring all estimates of mean recency periods, false-recent rates and incidence estimates to a fixed period T simplifies estimation procedures and allows the development of a consistent method for producing adjusted estimates of HIV incidence of improved accuracy. Unadjusted BED estimates of incidence, based on life-time recency periods, would be both extremely difficult to produce and of doubtful value."
https://openalex.org/W2047971420,"Background Polyandry is widespread throughout the animal kingdom. In the absence of direct benefits of mating with different males, the underlying basis for polyandry is enigmatic because it can carry considerable costs such as elevated exposure to sexual diseases, physical injury or other direct fitness costs. Such costs may be balanced by indirect genetic benefits to the offspring of polyandrous females. We investigated polyandry and patterns of parentage in the spider Stegodyphus lineatus. This species experiences relatively high levels of inbreeding as a result of its spatial population structure, philopatry and limited male mating dispersal. Polyandry may provide an opportunity for post mating inbreeding avoidance that reduces the risk of genetic incompatibilities arising from incestuous matings. However, multiple mating carries direct fitness costs to females suggesting that genetic benefits must be substantial to counter direct costs. Methodology/Principal Findings Genetic parentage analyses in two populations from Israel and a Greek island, showed mixed-brood parentage in approximately 50% of the broods. The number of fathers ranged from 1–2 indicating low levels of multiple parentage and there was no evidence for paternity bias in mixed-broods from both populations. Microsatellite loci variation suggested limited genetic variation within populations, especially in the Greek island population. Relatedness estimates among females in the maternal generation and potentially interacting individuals were substantial indicating full-sib and half-sib relationships. Conclusions/Significance Three lines of evidence indicate limited potential to obtain substantial genetic benefits in the form of reduced inbreeding. The relatively low frequency of multiple parentage together with low genetic variation among potential mates and the elevated risk of mating among related individuals as corroborated by our genetic data suggest that there are limited actual outbreeding opportunities for polyandrous females. Polyandry in S. lineatus is thus unlikely to be maintained through adaptive female choice."
https://openalex.org/W2011845346,"Melanopsin, the receptor molecule that underlies light sensitivity in mammalian ‘circadian’ receptors, is homologous to invertebrate rhodopsins and has been proposed to operate via a similar signaling pathway. Its downstream effectors, however, remain elusive. Melanopsin also expresses in two distinct light-sensitive cell types in the neural tube of amphioxus. This organism is the most basal extant chordate and can help outline the evolutionary history of different photoreceptor lineages and their transduction mechanisms; moreover, isolated amphioxus photoreceptors offer unique advantages, because they are unambiguously identifiable and amenable to single-cell physiological assays. In the present study whole-cell patch clamp recording, pharmacological manipulations, and immunodetection were utilized to investigate light transduction in amphioxus photoreceptors. A Gq was identified and selectively localized to the photosensitive microvillar membrane, while the pivotal role of phospholipase C was established pharmacologically. The photocurrent was profoundly depressed by IP3 receptor antagonists, highlighting the importance of IP3 receptors in light signaling. By contrast, surrogates of diacylglycerol (DAG), as well as poly-unsaturated fatty acids failed to activate a membrane conductance or to alter the light response. The results strengthen the notion that calcium released from the ER via IP3-sensitive channels may fulfill a key role in conveying - directly or indirectly - the melanopsin-initiated light signal to the photoconductance; moreover, they challenge the dogma that microvillar photoreceptors and phoshoinositide-based light transduction are a prerogative of invertebrate eyes."

https://openalex.org/W2040318628,"Post-translational modification of histone proteins are known to play an important role in regulating chromatin structure. In an effort to find additional histone modifications we set out to screen enzymes of the 2-oxoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent (2-OG-Fe(II)) dioxygenase family for activity towards histones. Here we show that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe 2-OG-Fe(II) dioxygenase domain containing protein-2 (Ofd2) is a histone H2A dioxygenase enzyme. Using a combination of peptide screening and alanine scanning substitution analysis, we identify an HxxLR motif in H2A as a substrate for Ofd2 activity. Transcriptional profiling indicates that Ofd2 regulates the repression of oxidative phosphorylation genes during hypoxic stress. We show that Ofd2 is recruited to the 5' end of oxidative phosphorylation genes specifically during hypoxia and that it uses its dioxygenase activity to regulate their transcription. Together, these data uncover a novel histone H2A modifying activity involved in the regulation of gene expression during hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W1964781261,"The regulation of variant gene expression in Plasmodium falciparum is still only partially understood. Regulation of var genes, the most studied gene family involved in antigenic variation, is orchestrated by a dynamic pattern of inherited chromatin states. Although recent evidence pointed to epigenetic regulation of transcribed and repressed rif loci, little is known about specific on/off associated histone modifications of individual rif genes. To investigate the chromatin marks for transcribed and repressed rif loci, we cultivated parasites and evaluated the transcriptional status of chosen rif targets by qRT-PCR and performed ChIP assays using H3K9ac and H3K9me3 antibodies. We then monitored changes in the epigenetic patterns in parasites after several reinvasions and also evaluated the “poised” mark in trophozoites and schizonts of the same erythrocytic cycle by ChIP using H3K4me2 specific antibodies. Our results show that H3K9 is acetylated in transcribed rif loci and trimethylated or even unmodified in repressed rif loci. These transcriptional and epigenetic states are inherited after several reinvasions. The poised modification H3K4me2 showed a tendency to be more present in loci in trophozoites that upon progression to schizonts strongly transcribe the respective locus. However, this effect was not consistently observed for all monitored loci. While our data show important similarities to var transcription-associated chromatin modifications, the observed swiftly occurring modifications at rif loci and the absence of H3K9 modification point to a different dynamic of recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2084813551,"Friend of GATA (FOG) plays many diverse roles in adult and embryonic hematopoiesis, however the mechanisms by which it functions and the roles of potential interaction partners are not completely understood. Previous work has shown that overexpression of FOG in Xenopus laevis causes loss of blood suggesting that in contrast to its role in mammals, FOG might normally function to repress erythropoiesis in this species. Using loss-of-function analysis, we demonstrate that FOG is essential to support primitive red blood cell (RBC) development in Xenopus. Moreover, we show that it is specifically required to prevent excess apoptosis of circulating primitive RBCs and that in the absence of FOG, the pro-apoptotic gene Bim-1 is strongly upregulated. To identify domains of FOG that are essential for blood development and, conversely, to begin to understand the mechanism by which overexpressed FOG represses primitive erythropoiesis, we asked whether FOG mutants that are unable to interact with known co-factors retain their ability to rescue blood formation in FOG morphants and whether they repress erythropoiesis when overexpressed in wild type embryos. We find that interaction of FOG with the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase complex (NuRD), but not with C-terminal Binding Protein, is essential for normal primitive RBC development. In contrast, overexpression of all mutant and wild type constructs causes a comparable repression of primitive erythropoiesis. Together, our data suggest that a requirement for FOG and its interaction with NuRD during primitive erythropoiesis are conserved in Xenopus and that loss of blood upon FOG overexpression is due to a dominant-interfering effect."
https://openalex.org/W2153046037,"Increasing evidence has indicated natural transspecies transmission of gammaretroviruses; however, viral-host interactions after initial xeno-exposure remain poorly understood. Potential association of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) in patients with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome has attracted broad interests in this topic. Although recent studies have indicated that XMRV is unlikely a human pathogen, further understanding of XMRV xenoinfection would allow in vivo modeling of the initial steps of gammaretroviral interspecies transmission, evolution and dissemination in a new host population. In this study, we monitored the long-term consequences of XMRV infection and its possible vertical transmission in a permissive foreign host, wild-derived Mus pahari mice. One year post-infection, XMRV-infected mice showed no notable pathological changes, while proviral DNA was detected in three out of eight mice. XMRV-infected mice remained seropositive throughout the study although the levels of gp70 Env- and p30 capsid-specific antibodies gradually decreased. When vertical XMRV transmission was assessed, no viremia, humoral immune responses nor endogenization were observed in nine offspring from infected mothers, yet one offspring was found PCR-positive for XMRV-specific sequences. Amplified viral sequences from the offspring showed several mutations, including one amino acid deletion in the receptor binding domain of Env SU. Our results therefore demonstrate long-term asymptomatic infection, low incidence of vertical transmission and limited evolution of XMRV upon transspecies infection of a permissive new host, Mus pahari."
