https://openalex.org/W2011077388,Chloroplasts in situ are surrounded by jackets of a material which does not contain chlorophyll. The chlorophyll-bearing inner structure lacks motion while the jackets constantly change shape. Long protuberances may extend from the jackets into the cytoplasm and may segment into particles that cannot be distinguished from mitochondria. Segmentation and other dynamic characteristics of living plant cells have been recorded on cine film.
https://openalex.org/W1983573031,"Weber ratios were obtained for visual velocity discrimination under three topographic conditions with the same subjects and psychophysical procedures. The conditions differed regarding the presence of either temporal or spatial cues, these being correlated in magnitude with stimulus velocity. Systematic effects of the cues upon the level of velocity discrimination were noted."

Either these meteorites came from the moon, or, more probably, the collision life times of interplanetary objects are occasionally much shorter than has been assumed heretofore."
https://openalex.org/W1965834565,"A caged queen honey bee, installed in an observation hive which already contained a virgin queen, piped in response to artificial piping which was played to it through the substrate. The experiments which followed this observation provide the first direct quantitative evidence that sound, at least in the range of 600 to 2000 cycles per second, is perceived by honey bees and that information is transmitted through sound from one bee to another."
https://openalex.org/W2022852160,A meteorite crater in the Wilkes Land region of Antarctica has been postulated as an explanation of the origin of australites. Geophysical data suggest that such a feature may have been located.
https://openalex.org/W2064371016,"A 16.5 liter spherical ion chamber was constructed of conducting muscle-equivalent plastic and filled to 760 mm-Hg with a muscle-equivalent gas. The use of the chamber for measurements of natural environmental backgrounds was made quite feasible with the aid of the recently developed Shonka vibrating quartz fiber electrometer. This instrument is routinely operable at the extremely high sensitivity of better than 5000 divisions per volt. This system, therefore, has made possible reproducible measurements of absorbed dose-rates of fractions of a micro-rad per hour without any need for the usual corrections for wall-effect, stopping power, and so forth."
https://openalex.org/W2171243050,"Observation by fluorescence of tomato pollen tubes in fixed styles clearly showed that all pollen samples grew regardless of age and fruit or seed setting potential. Methods commonly used to evaluate pollen viability, such as staining and germination, may predict growth in the style but do not always predict seed setting ability."
https://openalex.org/W2078629115,"Balloon-borne gamma-ray detection equipment flown from Thule, Greenland, during April 1962, indicated that there was considerable radioactivity above 70,000 feet. Gamma-ray spectra obtained indicated the source of much of the activity to be the Soviet nuclear tests in late 1961."
https://openalex.org/W1965898833,"There is now worldwide evidence of short-term increases in the earth's temperature during the last ice ages. This evidence comes from South American glaciers, Antarctic ice cores, and sediment cores from the tropical oceans, as well as Greenland ice cores. Researcher are unsure of the causes of these fluctuations. Some speculate a means for transmitting a climate signal from the North Atlantic to the rest of the world, while others look to some shorter-term version of the orbital variations that pace the cycle of the ice ages."
https://openalex.org/W2013045330,Complementary isochromosomes which shared homologies only for the centromere region and one or two adjacent chromomeres were rarely found associated at pachytene. It is therefore questioned whether the centromere plays an important specific role in the initiation of synapsis. It is also questioned whether centromere repulsion is a cause of diplotene separation and terminalization since the isochromosome univalent foldbacks assumed shapes typical of bivalents with chiasmata at diplotene and diakinesis.

https://openalex.org/W2021294565,"This article describes the successful fusion of a 50-50 deuterium-tritium mixture at the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor. Although the power produced was well short of break-even, it leads the way for future experiments designed to produce more power. Some of these future experiments are described such as the detection of alpha heating, and the potential of alpha particles to generate plasma instabilities."

https://openalex.org/W2138042706,A simple and accurate virus titration method which requires extremely low numbers of cells per test vessel is described. Inhibition of metabolism was the criterion for 50 percent end point analysis when capillary tubing was used as the cell culture container. Virus neutralization titers were obtained within 24 hours.
