https://openalex.org/W1591698562,Samples returned from the Apollo 15 site consist of mare basalts and breccias with a variety of premare igneous rocks. The mare basalts are from at least two different lava flows. The bulk chemical compositions and textures of these rocks confirm the previous conclusion that the lunar maria consist of a series of extrusive volcanic rocks that are rich in iron and poor in sodium. The breccias contain abundant clasts of anorthositic fragments along with clasts of basaltic rocks much richer in plagioclase than the mare basalts. These two rock types also occur as common components in soil samples from this site. The rocks and soils from both the front and mare region exhibit a variety of shock characteristics that can best be ascribed to ray material from the craters Aristillus or Autolycus.

By use of this technology, an 800-meter laser strain meter has been developed which operates above the surface of the ground. The instrument has a strain least count of 10(-10), requires no calibration, and has a flat and linear response from zero frequency to 1 megahertz. The linearity and large dynamic range of the laser strain meter offer unprecedented versatility in the recording of seismic strains associated with earthquakes and nuclear blasts. The extremely wide bandwidth opens new areas of the strain spectrum to investigation. A key to the understanding of the state of stress of the earth and the association phenomona of tectonic activity and earthquakes is a knowledge of the spatial distribution of the earth strain. Measurements of secular strain and earth tides indicate that, even at these long periods, surface strain measurements are valid representations of earth strain at depth. The LSM thus provides a means of making crustal strain measurements at points selected for maximum geophysical interest and ultimately allow the mapping of strain field distributions."

By means of an appropriate operational definition of these genes, a modified cis-trans test was used to interpret the position effects of codominant genes mutually recombined within each of two complex loci of flax, with the use of a specially developed method of analysis among F(2) segregants. The different behavior of genes in the M and L groups may reflect a difference in their structure sufficient to raise important implications in the theory of specific host-parasite interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2767435979,"The past decade has seen the rapid development and exploitation of one of the most significant tools of nuclear physics, the semiconductor radiation detector. Applications of the device to the analysis of materials promises to be one of the major contributions of nuclear research to technology, and may even assist in some aspects of our environmental problems. In parallel with the development of these applications, further developments in detectors for nuclear research are taking place: the use of very thin detectors for heavyion identification, position-sensitive detectors for nuclear-reaction studies, and very pure germanium for making more satisfactory detectors for many applications suggest major future contributions to physics."
https://openalex.org/W2064169216,"We began by pointing out that tools (for example) have size optima that are dictated by function. If we assume that the university has a function, it would seem reasonable to think about the size which will serve that function best. The principle of size optimization is fundamental, but its application to the university at once encounters a difficulty: What is the function of a university? It might take forever to secure general agreement on the answer to this question. The problem is that universities have a number of different functions, to which different individuals will attach different weights, and each function may well have a unique size optimum. Just as it is, in general, mathematically impossible to maximize simultaneously for two different functions of the same variable (29), so it is unsound to conceive of a single optimum for the multiversity. Nonetheless, a range of workable sizes may be defined by analyzing the effect of variation in size on all essential functions. The examples from biological systems illustrate this approach. Cells exist in a variety of sizes, each size presumably representing an optimization to one or another set of constraints, yet there are upper bounds. There are no cells the size of basketballs because essential metabolic functions are limited by the surface-to-volume ratio. We must emphasize that one does not need a grand theory of life in order to identify this limiting condition. If cells could talk, they would no doubt differ on the general philosophy of being a cell, yet all conceptions would be subject to certain physically inevitable limitations on size. In the case of the university, no grand theory of education is needed in order to identify dysfunctions of growth that affect essential activities (for example, the diffusion of individuals through, in, and out of the university) or that affect all activities (for example, overall morale). Balanced against these dysfunctions are such advantages of growth as economy, the achievement of a critical mass, and flexibility in staffing. Our analyis of data from the California system indicates that unit costs of education decline very little above a size of 10,000 or 15,000 students. Moreover, the critical mass for departmental excellence, at least in terms of the ACE ratings of graduate departments, is achieved by a university of about this size. Growth beyond this size range conitinues to provide flexibility in staffing and spares administrators the trouble of having to make difficult decisions. At the same time, the dysfunctions attendant on growth become steadily more severe. Our impression is that the dysfunctions have not been seriously considered, while the advantages have been greatly oversold. The idea of dysfunctional growth, although fundamental in biology, contradicts one of America's most cherished illusions. Particular dysfunctions of growth are rarely formulated, set down, and explicitly weighed against the potential advantages. Rather, the American prejudice has been to assume that growth is always good, or at least inevitable, and to treat the dysfunctions (which are inevitable) as managerial problems to be ironed out later or glossed over. There has also been a remarkable failure to think in terms of optima and to distinguish in this way between what we have termed functional and dysfunctional growth. Rather, the tendency has been to extrapolate functional growth into the dysfunctional range: If a university population of 10,000 confers certain advantages as compared with a population of 1,000, then it is assumed that a population of 100,000 must confer even more advantages. We suggest that it is time, in fact past time, to subject university growth to a more searching scrutiny. Functional and dysfunctional consequences need to be spelled out. Scale effects ought to be considered in connection with every plan for expansion. Ideally, one might expect a farsighted and tough-minded administration to carry out this function. This has rarely been the case. Too often administrators regard their function as simply that of broker among competing expansionist tendencies. Such a conception replaces philosophy by politics and often encourages mindless growth. Perhaps it is time for faculties to involve themselves in long-range planning and to pay the price of a more satisfactory environment by giving up some individual dreams of empire. The first step for every large university ought to be a careful analysis of scale effects (30). If analysis indicates that continued growth of a university will be, on balance, dysfunctional, we suggest that plans be formulated to establish an absolute limit on further enrollment increase, and an absolute limit on further building expansion. If further analysis indicates that a university is already well into the dysfunctional size range, then the obvious solution is to cut back. If this turns out to be the case, then we suggest that a program for the gradual reduction of the campus population be undertaken. There are two distinct ways to accomplish this: (i) the establishment of a new university and (ii) the decentralization of the existing university into two or more campuses. Decentralization strikes us as an attractive idea, worthy of careful study. One of the recommendations of the Scranton commission was, ""Large universities should take steps to decentralize or reorganize to make possible a more human scale"" (18, p. 14). Returning to the natural world, we note again that cells do not grow indefinitely. Instead, they divide."

https://openalex.org/W2917117820,"The samples and photographs returned from the Apollo 15 site show that Hadley Delta is largely underlain by breccias whose clasts are mainly fragments of coarse-grained feldspathic rocks and nonmare-type basalt. Conspicuous sets of lineaments, visible in surface and orbital photographs of Mount Hadley and Hadley Delta, may represent systematic layering or fracture sets. The mare surface, with regolith about 5 meters thick, is underlain by two major basalt types, at least one of which has extensive lateral continuity and is exposed in the upper wall of Hadley Rille. Gradual erosional recession of the edges and filing of the interior of the rille by talus have contributed to the present cross sectional profile."

This report was also the subject of a news story in Science. The passage quoted in the advertisement reads, “This entire episode [the presentations of John S. Foster, the Defense Department’s director of research and engineering, to various congressional committees] has been a classical numbers game featuring selective disclosure, questionable assumptions, exaggeratedly precise estimates, misleading language, and alarmist, non sequitur conclusions.”"

Transmission systems will become longer and be of higher duty; and a combination of popular demand and land cost will force the system underground at increasing distances from cities. The need for higher capacity cables to match the new overhead systems and for reduced capital and installation costs is forcing the search for better materials and new techniques. The vast size of the power industry implies that a breakthrough in technology would have dramatic consequences and even a small improvement in materials or techniques can be of significant economic importance."
