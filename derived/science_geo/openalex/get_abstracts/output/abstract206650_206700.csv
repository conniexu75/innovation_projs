https://openalex.org/W2090244439,"Three families in which there are five patients with cerebromacular degeneration have been studied, and preliminary findings show that both the patients and some of the members of their immediate families have generalized imidazole aminoaciduria. The patients excrete large amounts of carnosine and anserine as well as histidine and 1-methyl histidine. The urinary defect appears to be transmitted as a dominant trait and the cerebromacular degeneration as a recessive trait. The fact that the two traits have been found in three unrelated families makes it likely that the two are manifestations of the same gene."

https://openalex.org/W2075613671,"Eight Chlorophyta employ urea as a sole nitrogen source; five utilize uric acid and xanthine. The Cyanophyta, Rhodophyta, and Euglenophyta studied do not grow on these three nitrogen sources, although Anacystis nidulans decomposes uric acid to allantoin. None of the algae tested utilized either allantoin or creatinine."

https://openalex.org/W2050362630,"THE nucleus pulposus of the normal human intervertebral disk consists of collagen fibrils dispersed in a gel of polysaccharide and protein complexes. During ageing collagen fibrils are deposited as a matrix showing increasing orientation with age as seen from X-ray diffraction investigations1. In the case of specimens of more than 70 years of age, the normal photograph shows with the diagram of oriented collagen a clearly defined ring of spacing 4.7 A., which is similar to that associated with a denatured β-protein1 The presence of other components in the disk, for example, calcium phosphate, etc., will be discussed in a later publication. It was postulated from consideration of earlier work1 that the soluble protein molecules normally found in a folded form in the nucleus had unfolded and formed a hydrogen-bonded lattice which gave rise to this spacing."

https://openalex.org/W2076129597,"THE existence of acidic glycoproteins in human1–3 and bovine4,5 sera has been well established. A bovine M-2 glycoprotein has been isolated in an apparently pure state as described by us earlier5, and bovine orosomucoid has been purified by Weimer and Winzler4. This communication describes the isolation of reasonably homogeneous bovine orosomucoid and discusses its properties in relation to the corresponding human material."

https://openalex.org/W2007448288,"Contemporaneous movements of Rb86 cations and of P(32) orthophosphate across isolated rabbit mesentery display kinetic patterns that are generally associated with passive diffusion. Vasopressin at a concentration of 100 milliunit/ml produced a significant increase in the permeability constant for P(32) and at the same time a significant decrease in the permeability to Rb(86). At lower hormone concentrations (0.1 milliunit/ml) the P32 response was less marked but still significant (P < .01), while the Rb(86) effect was not (P > .05). Hyaluronidase did not mimic these actions of vasopressin."

The iodine-131 concentration rose rapidly to a maximum and then declined with an apparent half-life of 7 days after conclusion of the test series. The average dose to bovine thyroids from this test series was estimated to be 17 rads."

https://openalex.org/W2013869593,"IN an experimental study of urinary tract malformations, an attempt is being made in our laboratory to influence with chemical agents the embryonic development of the kidney. One substance that has been used is the amino-nucleoside derivative of ‘Puromycin(R)’, which is known to produce increased albuminuria and the nephrotic syndrome in rats. Hallman et al.1 have used this substance in attempts to induce a congenital nephrotic syndrome in experimental animals, and they have described renal tubular dilatation in some offspring of rats treated during the last days of pregnancy."
