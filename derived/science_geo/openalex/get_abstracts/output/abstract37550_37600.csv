https://openalex.org/W2122567567,"A cloned approximately 5 kb cDNA (human placenta) contains the coding sequences for the insulin receptor. The nucleotide sequence predicts a 1382 amino acid precursor. The alpha subunit comprises the N-terminal portion of the precursor and contains a striking cysteine-rich ""cross-linking"" domain. The beta-subunit (the C-terminal portion of the precursor) contains a transmembrane domain and, in the intracellular region, the elements of a tyrosine phosphokinase: an ATP-binding site and a possible tyrosine autophosphorylation site or sites. The overall structure is reminiscent of the EGF receptor; the cross-linking domain of the alpha subunit and several regions of the beta subunit exhibit sequence homology with the EGF receptor. The phosphokinase domain also exhibits homology with some oncogenic proteins that have tyrosine phosphokinase activity, in particular, a striking homology with v-ros. Southern blotting experiments suggest that the coding region spans more than 45 kb. The insulin receptor gene is located on chromosome 19."
https://openalex.org/W2110420813,"A clone encoding PrP 27-30, the major protein in purified preparations of scrapie agent, was selected from a scrapie-infected hamster brain cDNA library by oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the N terminus of the protein. Southern blotting with PrP cDNA revealed a single gene with the same restriction patterns in normal and scrapie-infected brain DNA. A single PrP-related gene was also detected in murine and human DNA. PrP-related mRNA was found at similar levels in normal and scrapie-infected hamster brain, as well as in many other normal tissues. Using antisera against PrP 27-30, a PrP-related protein was detected in crude extracts of infected brain and to a lesser extent in extracts of normal brain. Proteinase K digestion yielded PrP 27-30 in infected brain extract, but completely degraded the PrP-related protein in normal brain extract. No PrP-related nucleic acids were found in purified preparations of scrapie prions, indicating that PrP 27-30 is not encoded by a nucleic acid carried within the infectious particles."
https://openalex.org/W2023664289,"Some neurodegenerative disorders may be caused by abnormal synthesis or utilization of trophic molecules required to support neuronal survival. A test of this hypothesis requires that trophic agents specific for the affected neurons be identified. Cholinergic neurons in the corpus striatum of neonatal rats were found to respond to intracerebroventricular administration of nerve growth factor with prominent, dose-dependent, selective increases in choline acetyltransferase activity. Cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain also respond to nerve growth factor in this way. These actions of nerve growth factor may indicate its involvement in the normal function of forebrain cholinergic neurons as well as in neurodegenerative disorders involving such cells."

https://openalex.org/W1977958044,"Exposure of neu-oncogene-transformed NIH 3T3 cells to monoclonal antibodies reactive with the neu gene product, p185, results in the rapid and reversible loss of both cell-surface and total cellular p185. Although not directly cytotoxic, monoclonal anti-p185 antibody treatment causes neu-transformed NIH 3T3 cells to revert to a nontransformed phenotype, as determined by anchorage-independent growth. Isotype matched control antibodies of an unrelated specificity do not affect p185 levels or colony formation in soft agar by neu-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Soft agar colony formation by NIH 3T3 cells transformed by ras oncogenes is not affected by anti-p185 antibody treatment. Anchorage-independent growth of cells from the ethylnitrosourea-induced rat neuroblastoma line in which neu was originally detected by DNA transfection is also inhibited in the presence of anti-p185 monoclonal antibodies. Collectively, these results suggest that p185 is required to maintain transformation induced by the neu oncogene."

https://openalex.org/W1605793994,"Thrombin exhibited diverse effects on mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. It (a) decreased cAMP in the cell suspension, (b) inhibited adenylate cyclase in the Lubrol-permeabilized cell suspension in a GTP-dependent manner, increased releases of (c) arachidonic acid and (d) inositol from the cell monolayer prelabeled with these labeled compounds, (e) increased 45Ca2+ uptake into the cell monolayer, and (f) increased 86Rb+ uptake into the cell monolayer in a ouabain-sensitive manner. Most of the effects were reproduced by bradykinin, platelet-activating factor, and angiotensin II. The receptors for these agonists are thus likely to be linked to three separate effector systems: the adenylate cyclase inhibition, the phosphoinositide breakdown leading to Ca2+ mobilization and phospholipase A2 activation, and the Na,K-ATPase activation. Among the effects of these agonists, (a), (b), (c), and (e) were abolished, but (d) and (f) were not, by prior treatment of the cells with islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin, which ADP-ribosylates the Mr = 41,000 protein, the alpha-subunit of the inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Ni), thereby abolishing receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The effects (a), (c), (d), and (e) of thrombin, but not (b), were mimicked by A23187, a calcium ionophore. The effects of A23187, in contrast to those of receptor agonists, were not affected by the treatment of cells with IAP. Thus, the IAP substrate, the alpha-subunit of Ni, or the protein alike, may play an additional role in signal transduction arising from the Ca2+-mobilizing receptors, probably mediating process(es) distal to phosphoinositide breakdown and proximal to Ca2+ gating."
https://openalex.org/W1968053343,"Somatostatin receptor concentrations were measured in patients with Alzheimer's disease and controls. In the frontal cortex (Brodmann areas 6, 9, and 10) and temporal cortex (Brodmann area 21), the concentrations of somatostatin in receptors in the patients were reduced to approximately 50 percent of control values. A 40 percent reduction was seen in the hippocampus, while no significant changes were found in the cingulate cortex, postcentral gyrus, temporal pole, and superior temporal gyrus. Scatchard analysis showed a reduction in receptor number rather than a change in affinity. Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in both the frontal and temporal cortex. Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was linearly related to somatostatin-receptor binding in the cortices of Alzheimer's patients. These findings may reflect degeneration of postsynaptic neurons or cortical afferents in the patients' cerebral cortices. Alternatively, decreased somatostatin-like immunoreactivity in Alzheimer's disease might indicate increased release of somatostatin and down regulation of postsynaptic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2092481738,"Somatostatin receptors in rat brain, pituitary, and pancreas were labeled with two radioiodinated analogs of somatostatins 14 and 28. Two cyclic analogs of somatostatin, SMS201-995 and cyclo(Ala-Cys-Phe-D-Trp-Lys-Thr-Cys), showed biphasic displacement of binding to somatostatin receptors by these radioligands. In contrast, all other somatostatin analogs, including somatostatin-14, competed for the receptor sites with monophasic displacement of radioligand receptor binding. Thus two types of somatostatin receptors were identified. It was found that the pituitary and pancreas have predominantly one type of somatostatin receptor whereas the brain has both, and that different regions of the brain have various proportions of the two types. These findings suggest methods to characterize other types of somatostatin receptors subserving somatostatin's diverse physiological functions, including a potential role in cognitive function and extrapyramidal motor system control."
https://openalex.org/W2055880793,"Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes are activated either by duplicative (DA) transposition of the gene to a pre-activated expression site or by nonduplicative (NDA) activation of a previously silent telomeric gene. We have obtained a recombinant clone spanning the 5' barren region of the expression linked copy of the duplicated VSG gene 117a. By DNA sequence and hybridization analyses we have identified a pleomorphic family of 14–25 non-VSG genes that lie upstream of both DA and NDA VSG expression sites. These expression site associated genes (ESAGs) encode 1.2 kb poly(A)+ mRNAs that are specifically transcribed from the active VSG expression telomere in mammalian bloodstream stages of T. brucei but, in common with VSG genes, are not transcribed in procyclic culture forms. cDNA and genomic sequences predict open reading frames that are conserved in the two ESAGs examined."
https://openalex.org/W1520668250,"Addition of retinoic acid to human promyelocytic leukemia cells results in a dramatic increase in cellular transglutaminase activity. This increase is due to the induction of a specific intracellular transglutaminase, tissue transglutaminase. Retinoic acid-induced expression of tissue transglutaminase is potentiated by analogues of cyclic AMP. The induction of the enzyme can be detected within 6 h of the addition of the retinoid to the cell and results in increases of the enzyme of at least 50-fold. The induction of HL-60 transglutaminase is a specific response of the cells to retinoic acid and is not seen with other agents that induce HL-60 differentiation. We believe that the induction of tissue transglutaminase is a useful index of the early events in retinoid-regulated gene expression in both normal and transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1678098555,"The existence of an invasive adenylate cyclase in dialyzed urea extracts of the bacterium Bordetella pertussis has been suggested recently. Gel filtration of B. pertussis dialyzed urea extract shows that the invasive enzyme constitutes only a small portion of the total adenylate cyclase activity found in the extract. Its size is different than the size of the two peaks of adenylate cyclase activity identified in the extract. Ca2+ is absolutely required for the penetration of the invasive enzyme, it also controls the rate of intracellular cAMP accumulation in human lymphocytes exposed to dialyzed extract. These characteristics may be attributed to the increase in the size of the invasive enzyme as found by gel filtration chromatography of the extract in the absence of Ca2+. Removal of nonpenetrating adenylate cyclase that adheres to lymphocytes permits a direct assay of the intracellular enzyme. The time course of intracellular accumulation of adenylate cyclase activity is similar to the time course of intracellular accumulation of cAMP, suggesting that the invasive enzyme is rapidly deactivated, but not degraded, since it can be detected upon cell disruption. No appreciable amount of the enzyme is introduced when cells are incubated with extract at 4 degrees C for 120 min, then washed and incubated further at 37 degrees C. Concanavalin A inhibits cAMP accumulation irrespective of the time of its addition, and EGTA prevents penetration of the invasive enzyme even if added 20 min after addition of extract. These findings are different from those observed in other bacterial toxins thought to be internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. However, the cellular penetration of B. pertussis adenylate cyclase is cell-selective. It does not occur in human erythrocytes. In addition to human lymphocytes, S49 cyc- murine lymphoma, turkey erythrocytes, and rat oocytes accumulate cAMP in response to B. pertussis extract."

https://openalex.org/W1628233934,"Abstract Thyrotropin causes a time- and concentration-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells as measured by Quin2 fluorescence; the half-maximal response occurs in response to 1 X 10(-7) M thyrotropin. The effect of added thyrotropin is the same whether cells have been previously and chronically exposed to thyrotropin or whether they have been thyrotropin starved for several days. The thyrotropin effect on cytosolic Ca2+ has no relationship to intracellular cAMP levels with respect to dose and time course. Norepinephrine (1 X 10(-7) M) also causes increases in cytosolic Ca2+ in FRTL-5 thyroid cells. With the use of a variety of adrenergic inhibitors, norepinephrine was found to exert its effect via an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor. The exposure of FRTL-5 cells to physiological thyrotropin concentrations enhances the effect on cytosolic Ca2+ level induced by norepinephrine in vitro; the shape of the dose-response curve indicates a cooperative effect of the thyrotropin and norepinephrine. The increase in cytosolic Ca2+ seems to be derived from an intracellular pool rather than from the extracellular space. It is not prevented by nifedipine, a blocker of Ca2+ channels; it is present in cells exposed to ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid; and it is not associated with increased Ca2+ uptake into the cell. the thyrotropin- and norepinephrine-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ parallels the efflux of iodide and the organification of thyroglobulin in a dose-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1501271610,"Abstract A rapid phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase occurs in the PC12 nerve-like clonal cell line in response to nerve growth factor (NGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), dibutyryl-cAMP, cholera toxin, phorbol- 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), or potassium depolarization in the presence of calcium ions. Complete tryptic digestion and two-dimensional peptide mapping reveals four available sites of phosphorylation in the enzyme. Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrates that serine is the amino acid residue phosphorylated in each peptide. Specific phosphorylation of each of the four sites is achieved by different subsets of the above agents. One peptide site is phosphorylated in response to EGF alone. A second site is phosphorylated only in response to NGF, cholera toxin or dibutyryl-cAMP. A third site is phosphorylated only in response to potassium depolarization and requires the presence of extracellular Ca2+. The fourth site is the only site phosphorylated in response to PMA. These data indicate that at least 4 distinct kinase systems can act to phosphorylate tyrosine hydroxylase in PC12 cells. The PMA-stimulated peptide site is also phosphorylated in response to every one of the other agents. Further proteolytic digestions and phosphopeptide mapping of this common peptide, using Staphylococcus V8 protease and thermolysin, did not generate different phosphopeptides resulting from the different agents. These data suggest that the phosphorylation of this common peptide in response to all of the agents may be mediated by a common kinase, and, hence, that tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation by some agents may be mediated by two kinases. Although phosphopeptide maps of tyrosine hydroxylase resulting from cAMP elevation or NGF are qualitatively similar, quantitative differences exist, suggesting differential regulation of the same kinases by these agents. Tyrosine hydroxylase was found to be activated 2--4-fold in response to each phosphorylating agent. Thus, NGF and EGF present novel, natural means of regulating the activation state of tyrosine hydroxylase in responsive neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1496435773,"To understand how enzymatic pathways respond to changing external conditions, the fluxes through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and ancillary reactions were determined under three different growth conditions in Escherichia coli. The velocities through the major steps in each pathway were measured (a) for growth on acetate alone, (b) for growth on acetate plus glucose, and (c) during the transition caused by addition of glucose to cells growing on acetate. During the transition, the carbon flow through the Krebs cycle decreased by a factor of 5 despite an increase in the growth rate of the culture. Under these conditions, the dephosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase caused a 4-fold increase in its activity. This, together with the decreased rate of substrate production and the kinetic parameters of the branch point enzymes, led to a cessation of the flux through the glyoxylate shunt. The decreased rate of acetyl-CoA turnover, not an inhibition of acetate transport, caused a slower rate of acetate uptake in the presence of glucose. The modulation of protein phosphorylation and metabolite levels is one of the regulatory mechanisms which enables the bacterium to make dramatic shifts between metabolic pathways within a fraction of a doubling time."
https://openalex.org/W1589354481,"Abstract Exposure of rat glioma C6 cells to either isoproterenol or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) resulted in desensitization of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. After either treatment, the affinity of beta-receptors for isoproterenol was reduced. Thus, desensitization by TPA or isoproterenol appeared to involve an uncoupling of the beta-receptor from the stimulatory regulatory component (Ns) of adenylate cyclase. The activity of Ns, assayed by reconstitution of S49 cyc- adenylate cyclase activity, was found to be unchanged after desensitization. The activity of beta-receptors was measured by inactivating Ns and the catalytic component of adenylate cyclase in C6 membranes and fusing them with membranes lacking beta-receptors. Receptors from isoproterenol-treated C6 cells were less active in coupling to the foreign adenylate cyclase than receptors from untreated cells, whereas receptors from TPA-treated cells were fully active. This unexpected latter result was explored further. Lysates from C6 cells were centrifuged on linear sucrose density gradients and the gradient fractions assayed for beta-receptor binding activity. Most of the receptors were recovered in a heavy plasma membrane peak but some receptors also appeared in a membrane peak. After treatment of the cells with isoproterenol or TPA, the proportion of receptors in the light peak increased. Prior treatment of the cells with concanavalin A prevented the increase in light receptors caused by isoproterenol or TPA. In addition, the concanavalin A treatment prevented the desensitization of adenylate cyclase caused by TPA but not that caused by isoproterenol. Finally, desensitization of adenylate cyclase was reversed by polyethylene glycol-induced fusion of membranes from cells treated with TPA but not isoproterenol. We conclude that beta-agonists and phorbol esters desensitize adenylate cyclase by distinct mechanisms. Agonists cause a reduction in the functional activity of the beta-receptors followed by a segregation of the receptors into a light membrane fraction devoid of Ns. Phorbol esters do not alter the activity of the receptors but do cause their segregation."

https://openalex.org/W2042640142,"The somatostatins are neuropeptides of 14 and 28 amino acids that inhibit the release of growth hormone and other hypophyseal and gastrointestinal peptides. These neuropeptides are cleaved posttranslationally from a common precursor, pre-prosomatostatin. We report here the production and processing of pre-prosomatostatin by transgenic mice carrying a metallothionein-somatostatin fusion gene. The most active site of somatostatin production, as determined by hormone concentrations in the tissues, is the anterior pituitary, a tissue that does not normally synthesize somatostatin-like peptides. Anterior pituitary processed pre-prosomatostatin almost exclusively to the two biologically active peptides, somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28, whereas the liver and kidney synthesized much smaller quantities of predominantly a 6000 dalton somatostatin-like peptide. The growth of the transgenic mice was normal despite high plasma levels of the somatostatin-like peptides. These studies indicate that proteases which cleave prosomatostatin to somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14 are not specific to tissues that normally express somatostatin."

https://openalex.org/W1598121937,"The catalytic characteristics of F1-ATPases from uncD412 and uncD484 mutant strains of Escherichia coli were studied in order to understand how these beta-subunit mutations cause defective catalysis. Both mutant enzymes showed reduced affinity for ATP at the first catalytic site. While uncD412 F1 was similar to normal in other aspects of single site catalysis, uncD484 F1 showed a Keq of bound reactants greatly biased toward bound substrate ATP and an abnormally fast rate of Pi release. Impairment of productive catalytic cooperativity was the major cause of the reduced steady state (multisite) catalytic rate in both mutant enzymes. Addition of excess ATP to saturate second and/or third catalytic sites did promote ATP hydrolysis and product release at the first catalytic site of uncD412 F1, but the multisite turnover rate was significantly slower than normal. In contrast, with uncD484 F1, addition of excess ATP induced rapid release of ATP from the first catalytic site and so productive catalytic cooperativity was almost completely absent. The results show that both mutations affect properties of the catalytic site and catalytic site cooperativity and further that the relatively more severe uncD484 mutation affects a residue which acts as a determinant of the fate of bound substrate ATP during promotion of catalysis. Taken together with previous studies of uncA mutant F1-ATPases (Wise, J. G., Latchney, L. R., Ferguson, A. M., and Senior, A. E. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 1426-1432) the results indicate that catalytic site cooperativity in F1-ATPases involves concerted beta-alpha-beta intersubunit communication between catalytic sites on the beta-subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1590641803,"Photoaffinity labeling experiments with diphtheria toxin fragment A have implicated glutamic acid 148 as a constituent of the NAD binding site. To evaluate the role of this residue in ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2, we replaced it with aspartic acid by in vitro mutagenesis of a toxin gene fragment cloned in Escherichia coli. Fragment A containing aspartic acid at position 148 had less than 0.6% the ADP-ribosylation activity of wild-type fragment A. The mutation produced no change in sensitivity of fragment A to trypsin and little, if any, reduction in affinity of fragment A for NAD. These results indicate that glutamic acid 148 is essential for the ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 and are consistent with other data suggesting that this residue may be at or near the catalytic center of the toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1521773655,"The uncE114 mutation from Escherichia coli strain KI1 (Nieuwenhuis, F. J. R. M., Kanner, B. I., Gutnick, D. L., Postma, P. W., and Van Dam, K. (1973) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 325, 62-71) was characterized after transfer to a new genetic background. A defective H+-ATPase complex is formed in strains carrying the mutation. Based upon the genetic complementation pattern of other unc mutants by a lambda uncE114 transducing phage, and complementation of uncE114 recipients by an uncE+ plasmid (pCP35), the mutation was concluded to lie in the uncE gene. The uncE gene codes for the omega subunit (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding protein) of the H+-ATPase complex. The mutation was defined by sequencing the mutant gene. The G----C transversion found results in a substitution of Glu for Gln at position 42 of the omega subunit in the Fo sector of the H+-ATPase. The substitution did not significantly impair H+ translocation by Fo or affect inhibition of H+ translocation by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Wild-type F1 was bound by uncE114 Fo with near normal affinity, but the functional coupling between F1 and Fo was disrupted. The uncoupling was indicated by an H+-leaky membrane, even when saturating levels of wild-type F1 were bound. Disassociation of F1 from Fo under conditions of assay did partially contribute to the H+ leakiness, but the major contributor to the high H+ conductance was Fo with bound F1. The F1 bound to uncE114 membranes exhibited normal ATPase activity, but ATP hydrolysis was uncoupled from H+ translocation and was resistant to inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The F1 isolated from the uncE114 mutant was modified with partial loss of coupling function. However, this modification did not account for the uncoupled properties of the mutant Fo described above, since these properties were retained after reconstitution of mutant membrane (Fo) with wild-type F1."
https://openalex.org/W2058150917,"Coated vesicles have been purified in the past on the basis of their remarkably homogeneous structure, not their function. We have succeeded in isolating two subpopulations of bovine brain coated vesicles that carry specific “cargoes,” in this case two synaptic vesicle membrane polypeptides (Mr = 95,000 and 65,000). Monoclonal antibodies that recognize cytoplasmic domains of these polypeptides can penetrate the clathrin coat and recognize them on the outer surface of the coated vesicle membrane. An immunoadsorption technique could therefore be used to fractionate coated vesicles on the basis of their membrane composition. The subpopulations have the normal complement of conventional coated vesicle proteins. Exclusive, however, to the subpopulations that carry synaptic vesicle polypeptides are two new coated vesicle polypeptides (Mr = 38,000 and 29,000)."
https://openalex.org/W2156944927,"An ultrastructural immunostaining method that uses silver-intensified gold was combined with another procedure that uses biotin peroxidase conjugates to allow simultaneous identification of two neurotransmitter-related antigens in the central nervous system. Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons labeled with silver-intensified gold could be differentiated at both light and electron microscopic levels from glutamate decarboxylase-immunoreactive neurons labeled with peroxidase. Cross reactivity of the second group of immunoreagents with the first group was reduced by the heavy metal silver shell formed around the colloidal gold immunoglobulin complex. With this dual pre-embedding method, peroxidase-stained axons containing the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid were found to synapse directly on silver-stained dopamine neurons in the rat dorsomedial hypothalamus. This approach can be used in combination with a post-embedding immunocytochemical colloidal gold procedure, allowing ultrastructural identification of three neurotransmitter-related antigens in the same tissue section."
https://openalex.org/W1569624226,"The mechanism of action of prolactin in target cells and the role of prolactin in human breast cancer are poorly understood phenomena. The present study examines the effect of human prolactin (hPRL) on the synthesis of unique proteins by a human breast cancer cell line, T-47D, in serum-free medium containing bovine serum albumin. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Treatment of cells with hPRL (1-1000 ng/ml) and hydrocortisone (1 microgram/ml) for 36 h or longer resulted in the synthesis and secretion of three proteins having molecular weights of 11,000, 14,000, and 16,000. Neither hPRL nor hydrocortisone alone induced these proteins. Of several other peptide hormones tested, only human growth hormone, a hormone structurally and functionally similar to hPRL, could replace hPRL in causing protein induction. These three proteins were, therefore, referred to as prolactin-inducible proteins (PIP). Each of the three PIPs was purified to homogeneity by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and specific antibodies were generated to them in rabbits. By immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Western blot) of proteins secreted by T-47D cells, it was demonstrated that the three PIPs were immunologically identical to one another. In addition, the 16-kDa and 14-kDa proteins (PIP-16 and PIP-14), and not the 11-kDa protein (PIP-11), incorporated [3H]glycosamine. Furthermore, 2-deoxyglucose (2 mM) and tunicamycin (0.5 micrograms/ml), two compounds known to inhibit glycosylation, blocked the production of PIP-16 and PIP-14, with a concomitant increase in the accumulation of PIP-11. These results indicate PIP-16 and PIP-14 are glycosylated variants of PIP-11. Finally, in vitro translation of poly(A)+ messenger RNA followed by immunoprecipitation revealed a 12.5-kDa protein, possibly the precursor form of PIPs. In addition, T-47D cells treated with hPRL plus hydrocortisone contained 10-fold more mRNA for PIPs than control cells, suggesting that the hormones' action is at the level of gene expression. Our finding represents a first demonstration of prolactin regulation of gene expression in human target cells. The human breast cancer cells, T-47D, appear to be an excellent model to afford future studies on the molecular action of prolactin and on the possible role of prolactin in human breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1593791512,"Abstract ATP facilitates the sequestration of displaced triskelions by uncoating protein. In so doing, ATP is not hydrolyzed; nor does the concentration of ATP affect the equilibrium of this binding. However, the rates of both the binding of uncoating protein to clathrin and of their dissociation are greatly accelerated by ATP. These properties suggest that ATP acts catalytically to speed the capture of displaced triskelions by uncoating protein, as well as stoichiometrically in its hydrolysis to drive the displacement of triskelions from cages. The nucleotide specificity of this catalytic site for ATP on the uncoating protein is much less strict than that of the distinct hydrolytic site that drives the ATP-dependent displacement of triskelions from cages."
https://openalex.org/W1522747166,"Two peptides, speract (Gly-Phe-Asp-Leu-Asn-Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Gly) and resact (Cys-Val-Thr-Gly-Ala-Pro-Gly-Cys-Val-Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Leu-NH2), which activate sperm respiration and motility and elevate cyclic GMP concentrations in a species-specific manner, were tested for effects on guanylate cyclase activity. The guanylate cyclase of sea urchin spermatozoa is a glycoprotein and it is localized entirely on the plasma membrane. When intact sea urchin sperm cells were incubated with the appropriate peptide for time periods as short as 5 s and subsequently homogenized in detergent, guanylate cyclase activity was found to be as low as 10% of the activity of cells not treated with peptide. The peptides showed complete species specificity and analogues of one peptide (speract) caused decreases in enzyme activity coincident with their receptor binding properties. The peptides did not inhibit enzyme activity when added after detergent solubilization of the enzyme. When detergent-solubilized spermatozoa were incubated at 22 degrees C, guanylate cyclase activity declined in previously nontreated cells to the peptide-treated level. The rate of decline was dependent on temperature and protein concentration. When spermatozoa were first incubated with 32P, the decrease in guanylate cyclase activity was accompanied by a shift in the apparent molecular weight of a major plasma membrane protein (160,000-150,000) and a loss of 32P label from the 160,000 band. Other agents (Monensin A, NH4Cl) which were capable of stimulating sperm respiration and motility also caused decreases of guanylate cyclase activity when added to intact but not detergent-solubilized spermatozoa. The maximal decrease in guanylate cyclase activity occurred 5-10 min after addition of these agents. The enzyme response to Monensin A required extracellular Na+ suggestive that the ionophore caused the effect on guanylate cyclase activity by virtue of its ability to catalyze Na+/H+ exchange. These studies demonstrate that guanylate cyclase activity of sperm cells can be altered by the specific interaction of egg-associated peptides with their plasma membrane receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1591333540,"A plasmid that carries the uncF gene of Escherichia coli, which codes for the b subunit of the proton-translocating ATPase (F1F0), was mutagenized with hydroxylamine and ethyl methanesulfonate. Mutated plasmids were characterized by complementation analysis and by in vitro transcription/translation. Eleven of the plasmids mutated specifically in uncF were studied in detail: the nucleotide sequences of their uncF genes were determined and their effects on the F1F0 were measured. The results suggest that a C-terminal portion of the b subunit that involves the glycine residue at position 131, is required for the formation of a functional proton pore as well as for the binding of F1 to F0. A mutation in the N-terminal portion of the b subunit, in the glycine residue at position 9, also prevented the formation of a functional proton pore, but had only a small effect on the binding of F1 to F0."
https://openalex.org/W2019144029,"Specific radioimmunoassays were used to measure the effects of hypertonic saline (salt loading), water deprivation, and trichothecene mycotoxin (T2 toxin) on the content of methionine enkephalin (ME), leucine enkephalin (LE), α-neoendorphin, dynorphin A, dynorphin B, vasopressin, and oxytocin in the rat posterior pituitary. Concentrations of vasopressin and oxytocin decreased in response to both osmotic stimuli and treatment with T2 toxin, but the decrease was greater with osmotic stimulations. Similarly, concentrations of LE and dynorphin-related peptides declined after salt loading and water deprivation; LE concentrations also decreased after treatment with T2 toxin. The concentration of ME decreased after water deprivation, did not change after salt loading, and increased after T2 toxin treatment. The differentiating effects of these stimuli on the content of immunoreactive LE and ME are consistent with the hypothesis that LE and ME may be localized in separate populations of nerve endings with different roles in the posterior pituitary."
https://openalex.org/W1497841468,"Local anesthetics and other noncompetitive inhibitors (NCIs) of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, acting at sites other than the acetylcholine-binding sites, block channel opening and/or cation translation through the open channel. In order to characterize the NCI sites and to decide among possible mechanisms of NCI action, we have photolabeled the receptor in membrane from Torpedo electric tissue with the photolyzable NCI [3H]quinacrine azide ([3H]QA), using a continuous-flow, rapid-mixing device and millisecond-duration irradiation. Membrane, [3H]QA, and effectors were mixed, and, after delay times of 20 ms or greater, the mixture was irradiated for 2 ms, quenched, and collected. Brief exposure of the receptor to acetylcholine, but not to hexamethonium or d-tubocurarine, induced a state particularly susceptible to photoincorporation of [3H]QA. This acetylcholine-induced photoincorporation was exclusively into the alpha and beta chains of the receptor, peaked at 100-ms delay time, declined to 15% of maximum after delay times of minutes, and was blocked by the NCIs proadifen and histrionicotoxin. At 20-ms delay, the dependence of labeling by 2 microM [3H]QA on acetylcholine concentration was characterized by an apparent dissociation constant of about 15 microM and a Hill coefficient of 1. The kinetics of the development of susceptibility to photolabeling and the apparent lack of positive cooperativity in the effect of acetylcholine on this development suggest that the preferentially photolabeled state is a transient, rapidly developing, desensitized state, rather than an open-channel state."
https://openalex.org/W1508471581,"Uncoating ATPase catalyzes the ATP-dependent dissociation of clathrin from coated vesicles and empty cages. Following an uncoating reaction, clathrin triskelions are released intact, in a stoichiometric complex with bound uncoating protein. This overall uncoating process was dissected into two partial reactions. In the first, ATP hydrolysis drives the transient displacement of a portion of a triskelion from a cage. Uncoating protein then captures the displaced triskelion, in the second stage, by binding to a newly exposed site on clathrin that had previously been buried in the cage lattice. Triskelion-uncoating protein complexes are released when all points of attachment of the triskelion to the cage have been severed. The uncoating protein interacts with a distinct site on clathrin for each of these reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1567367426,"Purification of rat striatal tyrosine hydroxylase in the presence of protease inhibitors effected a high yield of apparently homogeneous enzyme which is stable to prolonged storage. The purified enzyme migrates as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of 61,300. Removal of protease inhibitors results in the appearance of additional bands with molecular weights of 59,800 and 57,000. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase incorporates 1 mol of phosphate/61,000-Da subunit of tyrosine hydroxylase, and concomitantly decreases the apparent Km of the enzyme for cofactor. Phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase is unstable at 37 degrees C, exhibiting a 50% decrease in apparent Vmax in 40 min with no change in Km for cofactor. Levels of incorporated phosphate remain constant over this time period. Tyrosine hydroxylase activated by and in the presence of phosphatidylinositol or high concentrations of NaCl exhibited a similar loss of activity at 37 degrees C, whereas enzyme activated by heparin was relatively stable. The rate of phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase is markedly increased in the presence of any of these effectors, suggesting that they promote a common conformation. Further, heparin appears to bind to tyrosine hydroxylase at a site distant from the phosphorylation site. Physiological effectors of tyrosine hydroxylase may act in concert with cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation, perhaps by binding to an allosteric site, to regulate enzyme activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1583927287,"Clathrin released from coated vesicles or empty cages by the ATP-dependent action of uncoating protein exists as a complex with the uncoating protein. Despite its apparent consumption during a round of uncoating, we have found that uncoating protein functions as an enzyme in that it rapidly and spontaneously recycles from its product (triskelions) to its substrate (cages). The binding of uncoating protein to clathrin triskelions is a complex equilibrium that involves the interaction of uncoating protein with at least two distinct sites on the clathrin molecule. Limited proteolysis dissected clathrin into two domains, each of which contained distinct binding sites. Binding to one of these sites, located on the proximal leg of a triskelion, was dependent upon the presence of light chains and was unstable to gel filtration. Binding to the second kind of site, located on the distal portion of a triskelion leg, was stable to gel filtration and was independent of the presence of light chains."
https://openalex.org/W1547689991,"A cloned DNA fragment related to pT17 containing a partial cDNA sequence of human terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was used as a probe to screen for the full length cDNA sequence of the enzyme in a lambda gt11 library constructed from human lymphoblastoid KM-3 cDNA. A recombinant containing a 2068-base pair insert was isolated and recloned into the EcoRI site of the sequencing plasmic pUC-8 as two subclones, pT711 and pT106. DNA sequencing and hybridization studies showed that pT711 contains the pT17 sequence and an additional 172 upstream nucleotides. pT711 represents the coding sequence for the carboxyl half of the terminal transferase protein. pT106, containing a 965-base pair insert, hybridizes to the same mRNA as pT711 on Northern blots and contains an open reading frame that is in phase with the reading frame of the insert in pT711. Amino acid sequencing of the 58-kDa peptide of the calf thymus terminal transferase failed, indicating that the N terminus is blocked. N-Terminal sequencing of a 56-kDa form of the protein produced 24 amino acids corresponding to the translated human cDNA coding sequence starting at residue 398 of the insert in pT106 with 83% homology between bovine and human sequence. The initiation codon is assigned to an ATG sequence at nucleotide 329 of the insert in pT106. Comparison of the translated human terminal transferase sequence with peptides from the calf thymus enzyme showed that the homology between the human and bovine enzyme is better than 90% among 263 amino acids determined. The coding sequences in pT106 and pT711 were recloned into an expression plasmid pUC-19 downstream from the lac promoter and in phase with the coding sequence of the lac Z gene. Lysates of bacteria carrying the reconstructed coding sequence of human terminal transferase contain a fused protein of 60 kDa that reacts with rabbit antibody to terminal transferase on immunoblots and exhibits enzyme activity. Isolation of this fused protein from bacterial lysates with mouse monoclonal antibody to human terminal transferase produces the expected protein of 60 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1569039683,"The mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) receptor is an integral membrane glycoprotein which mediates intracellular transport and receptor-mediated endocytosis of lysosomal proteins. Clathrin-coated vesicles, which have been shown to be significantly involved in these processes, have also been shown to be a major subcellular site of the receptor. In order to define the orientation of the Man-6-P receptor within the coated vesicle membrane, highly purified preparations of coated vesicles were prepared from bovine brain employing D2O/sucrose gradient centrifugation and Sephacryl S-1000 column chromatography. Using [35S]methionine-labeled lysosomal enzymes secreted by Chinese hamster ovary cells as receptor ligand, significant binding activity was detected only upon permeabilization of the coated vesicle membranes with detergent. Prior treatment of intact vesicles with proteinase K resulted in similar binding activity upon permeabilization. However, examination of the receptor by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with rabbit anti-receptor serum revealed that proteinase K treatment of intact vesicles reduced the size of the receptor by 12,000 daltons. A similar decrease in size was obtained when the vesicles were treated with carboxypeptidase Y. These results suggest that the Man-6-P receptor is a transmembrane protein with its lysosomal enzyme binding site oriented toward the lumen of the coated vesicle and its C-terminal end exposed to the exterior or cytoplasmic portion of the vesicle membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1551132111,"When coated vesicles (CVs) are incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP, radioactivity is rapidly incorporated into a compound identified by thin layer chromatography as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. This activity has been identified in CVs isolated from bovine brain as well as from rat liver and chick embryo skeletal muscle. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase is not separated from CVs during agarose electrophoresis, which produces CVs of greater than 95% purity, indicating that the activity present does not derive from contamination. The specific activity of these highly purified CVs was demonstrated to be approximately twice that of synaptic plasma membranes, further ruling out contamination from this source. The PI kinase remains associated with the vesicle upon removal of clathrin and its associated proteins and is solubilized by nonionic detergents, suggesting it is an integral membrane protein. We have been unable to demonstrate the formation of significant amounts of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in any of our CV preparations. In the presence of exogenous PI, activity is stimulated, with maximal phosphorylation occurring at 0.1 mM. The enzyme appears to be maximally stimulated by 200 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM ATP and is most active at pH 7.25. Calculations indicate that, under optimal conditions, approximately 25 molecules of PIP are produced per CV within 60 s, suggesting that these structures may play an important role in cellular PI metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1554293391,"8-Azidoflavins have been synthesized and their potential as photoaffinity labels for flavoproteins has been explored. They are very photolabile, and in aqueous media they react with solvent to yield 8-aminoflavins and 8-hydroxlaminoflavins as the main products. They fulfill the criteria expected of a good photoaffinity label, since they bind stoichiometrically at the flavin-binding site of flavoproteins, thus minimizing problems of nonspecific labeling. Second, they absorb strongly in the visible, so that the reactive nitrene can be generated without short wavelength light, minimizing the possibility of light-induced damage of the protein. Third, in the absence of light, 8-N3-flavins are stable, permitting a study of their binding to apoproteins. 8-Azidoflavins have been bound to hen egg white riboflavin-binding protein, Megasphera elsdenii flavodoxin, yeast Old Yellow Enzyme, Aspergillus niger, glucose oxidase, and pig kidney D-amino acid oxidase, and the effect of exposure to visible light has been determined. Only small extents of covalent attachment of the flavin to the protein were found with flavodoxin, D-amino acid oxidase, and Old Yellow Enzyme; much more extensive labeling was obtained with glucose oxidase and riboflavin-binding protein. In addition to their photoreactivity, 8-azidoflavins have been found to be converted to 8-aminoflavins by reaction with sulfite or upon reduction. Similar reactions occur with 8-hydroxylamino-, 8-(O-methyl)hydroxylamino-, and 8-hydrazinoflavins, which serve as models for possible flavin-protein covalent linkages which could be formed in the photolabeling procedure. Some of the properties of these flavins, which were obtained by reaction of 8-F-flavin with the corresponding nucleophiles, are also described."
https://openalex.org/W1550364990,"The ATPase activity of soluble chloroplast coupling factor (CF1) was irreversibly inactivated by phenylglyoxal, an arginine reagent. Under the conditions of inactivation, 2.48 mol of [14C]phenylglyoxal were incorporated per 400,000 g of enzyme when the ATPase was inactivated 50% by the reagent. Isolation of the component polypeptide subunits of the [14C]phenylglyoxal-modified enzyme revealed that the distribution of moles of labeled reagent/mol of subunit was the following: alpha, 0.37; beta, 0.40; gamma, 0.08; delta, none; epsilon, 0.03. CNBr treatment of the isolated alpha and beta subunits and fractionation of the peptides by gel electrophoresis revealed that the radioactivity bound to the alpha subunit was nonspecifically associated with several peptides, while a single peptide derived from the beta subunit contained the majority of the radioactivity associated with this subunit. After treating the isolated beta subunit with trypsin and Staphylococcus aureus protease, a major radioactive peptide was isolated with a sequence Arg-Ile-Thr-Ser-Ile-Lys. This sequence, when compared with the primary structure of the CF1 beta subunit as translated from the gene (Zurawski, G., Bottomley, W., and Whitfeld, P. R. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 6260-6264) indicated that the arginine marked with the asterisk, the predominant residue modified by phenylglyoxal when the ATPase activity of CF1 is inactivated by the reagent, is Arg 312."
https://openalex.org/W1569324528,"Abstract The effects of 4-fluoroglutamate on the reaction catalyzed by partially purified rat liver folylpolyglutamate synthetase have been investigated. DL-threo-4-Fluoroglutamate was an effective, concentration-dependent inhibitor of polyglutamylation of both tetrahydrofolate and methotrexate, while the erythro isomer was weakly inhibitory. 4-Fluoroglutamate acted as an alternate substrate; the DL-threo isomer was incorporated only slightly less effectively than L-glutamate, while the erythro isomer was poorly incorporated. The resulting product, a pteroylglutamyl-gamma-(4-fluoro)glutamate, was a very poor substrate for further glutamylation. Thus, when tetrahydrofolate and 4-fluoroglutamate were substrates, the sole Zn/HCl cleavage product co-chromatographed on high performance liquid chromatography with chemically synthesized p-aminobenzoylglutamyl-gamma-(4-fluoro)glutamate. When [3H]methotrexate (4-NH2-10-CH3PteGlu) and 4-fluoroglutamate were the substrates, one product was obtained which co-chromatographed on high performance liquid chromatography with chemically synthesized 4-NH2-CH3PteGlu-gamma-(4-fluoro)glutamate. Further evidence that the product from [3H]methotrexate was a dipeptide came from gamma-glutamyl hydrolase digestion experiments and quantitative amino acid analysis. The appearance of trace amounts of a product having properties consistent with the addition of a second 4-fluoroglutamate occurred only under forcing conditions. The chemically and enzymatically synthesized fluoroglutamate-containing products were at least 15 times poorer than the analogous diglutamyl compound as substrates for rat liver folylpolyglutamate synthetase. These results are consistent with inhibition of polyglutamate synthesis by 4-fluoroglutamate through a leaky chain termination mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1505697678,"We have obtained a number of variant HTC cells which are capable of vigorous replication in the presence of 6 mM sodium butyrate. These cells show characteristic changes in histone acetylation. H2A/H2B are no longer modified and the turnover of histones H3/H4 acetate is about 4-fold greater than in control HTC cells at the same butyrate concentration. Histone deposition continues successfully even though histones H3/H4 become hyperacetylated upon association with the chromatin. Prompt deacetylation of new histones does not appear to be a prerequisite for successful deposition processes. Initial enzymatic studies indicate that not only do the butyrate-resistant cells show an increased deacetylase activity (on a per cell basis), but also the enzyme is less sensitive to sodium butyrate under in vitro assay conditions. In contrast to control HTC cells in 6 mM butyrate in which dexamethasone induction of tyrosine aminotransferase is inhibited, the butyrate-resistant variant cells are capable of tyrosine aminotransferase induction even in the presence of butyrate. The implications of these observations are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1641354212,"The ATPase from the inner mitochondrial membrane is known to be inhibited by modification of one of the three catalytic subunits with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) or 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole. An experimental approach described in this paper shows that most of the residual ATPase activity observed after the usual DCCD or 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole modification is due to the presence of unmodified enzyme, although the large fraction of modified enzyme retains a weak catalytic activity. This weak catalytic activity can be stimulated by methanol or dimethyl sulfoxide. When the modified enzymes are exposed to Mg2+ and [3H]ATP, about equal amounts of [3H]ATP and [3H]ADP appear at catalytic sites. The turnover rate for these enzymes is less than 1/1000 that of the native enzyme when it is calculated from the rate at which the enzyme becomes labeled at the catalytic sites with [3H]ATP and [3H]ADP during steady state hydrolysis. In addition, a higher ATP concentration is required for steady state turnover and, after ATP binding, the principal rate-limiting step is the capacity of the derivatized enzyme to undergo the binding changes necessary for the release of ADP and Pi. When the modified enzymes are not hydrolyzing ATP, they convert to form(s) that show a distinct lag in the replacement of bound nucleotides at catalytic sites. The replacement of bound nucleotides is still promoted by MgATP, even though the enzymes have been converted to sluggish forms. Contrary to a recent suggestion based on the study of the DCCD-modified enzyme (Soong, K.S., and Wang, J.H. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 136-141), our data provide evidence for the existence of catalytic cooperatively between at least two alternating sites in the modified enzyme and are consistent with continued sequential participation of all three sites."
https://openalex.org/W1487138159,"The peptides that represent the major components with alpha-endorphin- and gamma-endorphin-like immunoreactivity in the rat neurointermediate lobe were purified to homogeneity and chemically characterized. Rat neurointermediate lobes were extracted by boiling and homogenization in acetic acid. Peptide purification was based on gel filtration, followed by two high-pressure liquid chromatography steps. Pools containing peptides with the size and immunochemical properties of alpha- and gamma-endorphins were resolved by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography into multiple immunoreactive components. The major forms were finally purified by paired-ion high-pressure liquid chromatography. The amino acid compositions of these peptides fitted the beta-endorphin sequences 1-16 and 1-17. Tryptic mapping, aminopeptidase M digestion, chromatographic characterization, and immunoreactivity to an antiserum recognizing the N alpha-acetylated terminus of endorphins showed that these peptides were indistinguishable from N alpha-acetyl-alpha-endorphin (N alpha-acetyl-beta-endorphin 1-16), and N alpha-acetyl-gamma-endorphin (N alpha-acetyl-beta-endorphin 1-17). The NH2-terminal residue of the peptides was identified by mass spectrometry as N alpha-acetyltyrosine, substantiating the identity of the peptides. The results demonstrate the existence of N alpha-acetylated alpha- and gamma-endorphin as endogenous peptides in the neurointermediate lobe of the rat pituitary gland. In view of their occurrence and biological properties they should be considered significant members of the pro-opiomelanocortin family."
https://openalex.org/W1594213192,"This study examined the nature of the metal-nucleotide complexes which serve as substrates, products, and intermediates in the beef heart mitochondrial ATPase reaction. The two methods employed involved the use of phosphorothioate ATP analogs as substrates in the presence of Mg2+ or Cd2+ and the use of substitution inert Cr X ATP complexes (the isolated diastereomers of the bidentate complexes) along with the newly synthesized Cr X ITP complexes as inhibitors of both the F1-ATPase and F1-ITPase activities. Little stereoselectivity was observed in the inhibition of F1-ATPase and F1-ITPase activities by the isolated diastereomers of beta,gamma-bidentate CrATP, while the inhibition by the delta,alpha,beta-bidentate CrADP diastereomer was greater than that of the lambda epimer. gamma-Monodentate CrITP was a weak inhibitor of both the ATPase and ITPase activities, whereas beta,gamma-bidentate CrITP failed to show any inhibition at all up to a concentration of 3.2 mM. When adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiotriphosphate) (ATP beta S) was used as the substrate, (VmSp]/(Vm(Rp] with Mg2+ present was 2.7 at 31 degrees C and 3.5 at 13 degrees C. The (Vm/Km(Sp]/(Vm/Km(Rp] ratios with Mg2+ present were 15.3 at 31 degrees C and 73.3 at 13 degrees C. With Cd2+ present, the (Vm(Sp]/(Vm(Rp] ratios were 0.81 and 0.65 at 31 and 13 degrees C, respectively. The (Vm/Km(Sp]/(Vm/Km(Rp] ratios with Cd2+ present were 1.17 at 31 degrees C and 1.34 at 13 degrees C. The large activation energy observed for the isomers of CdATP beta S was not observed for MgATP beta S, MgATP, or CdATP. The Vm for Cd adenosine 5'-O-thiotriphosphate (ATP gamma S) hydrolysis was the largest of all the metal-phosphorothioate nucleotide complexes, while that for MgATP gamma S was the smallest. The results are interpreted in terms of a catalytic model for F1-catalyzed nucleotide hydrolysis describing metal-nucleotide chelation during the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1606403401,"The amino acid analog, albizziin, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of asparagine synthetase with respect to glutamine was used to isolate mutants of Chinese hamster ovary cells with alterations in levels of the target enzyme. These mutant lines have been characterized biochemically and genetically. Mutants selected in a single step are up to 40-fold more resistant to the drug than the parental line, express levels of asparagine synthetase activity 6-17-fold greater than that of wild type cells, and act co-dominantly in hybrids. Several classes of mutations can be distinguished on the basis of cross-resistance to beta-aspartyl hydroxamate, another amino acid analog. Studies on asparagine synthetase indicate that resistance to albizziin may be due to altered regulation of asparagine synthetase, structural mutations of the enzyme, and gene amplification."
