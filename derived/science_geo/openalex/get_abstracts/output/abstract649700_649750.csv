Like humans, mice report forepaw skin warming with perceptual thresholds of less than 1°C and do not confuse warm with cool. We identify two populations of polymodal C-fibers that signal warm. Warm excites one population, whereas it suppresses the ongoing cool-driven firing of the other. In the absence of the thermosensitive TRPM2 or TRPV1 ion channels, warm perception was blunted, but not abolished. In addition, trpv1:trpa1:trpm3−/− triple-mutant mice that cannot sense noxious heat detected skin warming, albeit with reduced sensitivity. In contrast, loss or local pharmacological silencing of the cool-driven TRPM8 channel abolished the ability to detect warm. Our data are not reconcilable with a labeled line model for warm perception, with receptors firing only in response to warm stimuli, but instead support a conserved dual sensory model to unambiguously detect skin warming in vertebrates.

Since the discovery of hot and cold spots on the skin (Blix, 1882Blix M. Experimentela bidrag till losning af fragan om hudnervernas specifika energi.Uppsala Lakfor. Forh. 1882; 18: 87-102Google Scholar), the perception of innocuous warm or cool has been hypothesized to be mediated by specific and separate sensory channels (Schepers and Ringkamp, 2010Schepers R.J. Ringkamp M. Thermoreceptors and thermosensitive afferents.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2010; 34: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Dedicated primary afferent thermoreceptors have been described in primate and human skin that respond exclusively to temperature and fire specifically to cooling or warming, but not painful, thermal stimuli (Campero et al., 2001Campero M.

These afferents typically show ongoing activity at room temperature that is suppressed or enhanced by small temperature changes. Dedicated thermoreceptors have unmyelinated C-fiber axons (Darian-Smith et al., 1979aDarian-Smith I. Johnson K.O. LaMotte C. Shigenaga Y. Kenins P. Champness P.

Warm or cool sensation could also be relayed by polymodal C-fiber afferents that are also mechanosensitive. In contrast to dedicated thermoreceptors, these fibers increase their firing rates monotonically as temperatures become noxious (Campero et al., 1996Campero M. Serra J. Ochoa J.L. C-polymodal nociceptors activated by noxious low temperature in human skin.J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The relative contribution of dedicated thermoreceptors as opposed to polymodal temperature-sensitive afferents to the perception of innocuous cool or warm has yet to be addressed. Recently, it was shown that mice perceive low-threshold thermal stimuli as assessed with a goal-directed perception task (Milenkovic et al., 2014Milenkovic N. Zhao W.-J.W.-J. Walcher J. Albert T.

Mice are able to detect cooling of the skin with perceptual thresholds of just 1°C, similarly to humans (Frenzel et al., 2012Frenzel H. Bohlender J. Pinsker K. Wohlleben B. Tank J. Lechner S.G.S.G.

Res. 1998; 15: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We found that activity in polymodal C-fibers was required to perceive innocuous skin cooling (Milenkovic et al., 2014Milenkovic N. Zhao W.-J.W.-J. Walcher J. Albert T. Siemens J. Lewin G.R. Poulet J.F.A. A somatosensory circuit for cooling perception in mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is clear that thermosensitive TRP channels are key players in conferring temperature sensitivity to polymodal nociceptors (Caterina et al., 1997Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A.

Zimmermann K. et al.A TRP channel trio mediates acute noxious heat sensing.Nature. 2018; 555: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The availability of mice in which specific trp genes have been deleted allows the experimental manipulation of afferent temperature sensitivity to probe the nature of the sensory information required for temperature perception. At the molecular level, there is overwhelming evidence that the cold-activated ion channel TRPM8 is necessary for the transduction of cold (McKemy, 2013McKemy D.D. The molecular and cellular basis of cold sensation.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2013; 4: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, McKemy et al., 2002McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Identification of a cold receptor reveals a general role for TRP channels in thermosensation.Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar); mice lacking this channel have severe noxious and innocuous cool-evoked behavioral and perceptual deficits (Bautista et al., 2007Bautista D.M.

A somatosensory circuit for cooling perception in mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Much less is known about candidate molecules for warm transduction; early studies implicated TRPV3 and TRPV4 (Lee et al., 2005Lee H. Iida T. Mizuno A. Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. Altered thermal selection behavior in mice lacking transient receptor potential vanilloid 4.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1304-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, Moqrich et al., 2005Moqrich A.

Impaired thermosensation in mice lacking TRPV3, a heat and camphor sensor in the skin.Science. 2005; 307: 1468-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), but later studies with mutant mice on pure genetic backgrounds did not support the initial conclusions (Huang et al., 2011Huang S.M. Li X. Yu Y. Wang J. Caterina M.J. TRPV3 and TRPV4 ion channels are not major contributors to mouse heat sensation.Mol. Pain. 2011; 7: 37Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). More recently, the TRPM2 channel was shown to be activated by warm temperatures (>35°C) and was implicated as a warm transducer in sensory neurons (Tan and McNaughton, 2016Tan C.-H. McNaughton P.A. The TRPM2 ion channel is required for sensitivity to warmth.Nature. 2016; 536: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Togashi et al., 2006Togashi K. Hara Y. Tominaga T. Higashi T.

Mulier, I. Vandewauw, J.V., T.V., unpublished data). Additionally, the capsaicin and noxious heat-activated TRPV1 channel, which is co-expressed with TRPM2 in sensory neurons (Tan and McNaughton, 2016Tan C.-H. McNaughton P.A. The TRPM2 ion channel is required for sensitivity to warmth.Nature. 2016; 536: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), was implicated in warm sensation (Song et al., 2018Song K. Wang H. Kamm G.B. Pohle J. Reis F. de C. Heppenstall P. Wende H. Siemens J. The TRPM2 channel is a hypothalamic heat sensor that limits fever and can drive hypothermia.Science. 2018; 353: 1393-1398Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar, Tan and McNaughton, 2016Tan C.-H.

Coding and plasticity in the mammalian thermosensory system.Neuron. 2016; 92: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the expression patterns of thermosensitive TRP channels in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are complex, and it is clear that ion channels with opposite thermal preference (hot and cold) are co-expressed in single cells (Takashima et al., 2007Takashima Y. Daniels R.L. Knowlton W. Teng J. Liman E.R. McKemy D.D. Diversity in the neural circuitry of cold sensing revealed by genetic axonal labeling of transient receptor potential melastatin 8 neurons.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14147-14157Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, Vandewauw et al., 2018Vandewauw I. De Clercq K. Mulier M. Held K. Pinto S. Van Ranst N. Segal A. Voet T. Vennekens R. Zimmermann K. et al.A TRP channel trio mediates acute noxious heat sensing.Nature. 2018; 555: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The complexity of the expression of trp channels and thermal response properties of peripheral sensory afferents prompted us to ask whether patterned sensory input or labeled sensory-afferent lines for temperature drive warm or cool perception. We used a goal-directed thermal perception task for head-restrained mice (Milenkovic et al., 2014Milenkovic N. Zhao W.-J.W.-J. Walcher J. Albert T. Siemens J. Lewin G.R. Poulet J.F.A. A somatosensory circuit for cooling perception in mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The glabrous skin of the right forepaw of water-restricted mice was tethered to a Peltier element (Figure 1A). The Peltier element was held at a baseline temperature of 32°C, and brief warming stimuli of 10°C (total duration 4 s) were applied randomly (Figure 1B). Mice were rewarded with water if they licked the sensor between stimulus onset and the re-cooling phase. If mice licked within 2 s before stimulus onset, a 3- to 30-s delay was imposed as a timeout to promote stimulus-lick association. To assess whether licking was selective to the thermal stimulus, “catch” trials were used where no warming or water reward were delivered. We then compared hit and false-alarm rates to assess learning in the task (Figure 1B). First, we used a small Peltier element (3 × 3 mm) to stimulate the center of the right forepaw; mice report cooling of this skin area within two training sessions (Milenkovic et al., 2014Milenkovic N. Zhao W.-J.W.-J. Walcher J. Albert T. Siemens J. Lewin G.R. Poulet J.F.A. A somatosensory circuit for cooling perception in mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1560-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, mice given a warming stimulus to the same area exhibited similar hit and false-alarm rates, even after 14 days of training (n = 7 mice; Figure S1A). In contrast, when a larger skin area was stimulated (Peltier surface 8 × 8 mm, covering most of the forepaw glabrous skin), mice learned to report warming within three to four sessions (n = 12 mice; Figures 1C and 1D). Therefore, as in humans (Stevens et al., 1974Stevens J.C. Marks L.E. Simonson D.C. Regional sensitivity and spatial summation in the warmth sense.Physiol. Behav. 1974; 13: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), spatial summation is critical for warmth perception. Next, we measured perceptual thresholds for warming by reducing stimulus amplitude after mice had learned to report a 10°C stimulus. Mice were able to report a warming stimulus of just 1°C (from 32°C to 33°C; Figure 1E). Thus, mice have similar perceptual thresholds for warm as humans (Frenzel et al., 2012Frenzel H. Bohlender J. Pinsker K. Wohlleben B. Tank J. Lechner S.G.S.G. Schiska D. Jaijo T. Rüschendorf F. Saar K. et al.A genetic basis for mechanosensory traits in humans.PLoS Biol. 2012; 10: e1001318Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Stevens and Choo, 1998Stevens J.C. Choo K.K. Temperature sensitivity of the body surface over the life span.Somatosens. Mot. Res. 1998; 15: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We next compared the perceptual performance of mice to warm and cool stimuli delivered with the larger 8 × 8 mm Peltier from 32°C baseline. Mice learned the cooling task much more rapidly than the warming task; for example, for cooling, hit and false-alarm rates were already significantly different after the first training session (n = 7 mice, p < 0.0001; Figures S1D and S1E). To more directly compare performance in the warming and cooling detection task, we used d′ measurements (sensitivity index; see STAR Methods) and found that cooling-trained mice had higher d′ values than warming-trained mice throughout all training sessions (Figure S1E). Moreover, we found that mice were able to report a cooling stimulus of just 0.5°C (Figure S1F), whereas warm-trained mice were not (Figure S1E). Thus, as in humans, cooling perception has a lower threshold than for warming (Frenzel et al., 2012Frenzel H. Bohlender J. Pinsker K. Wohlleben B. Tank J. Lechner S.G.S.G. Schiska D. Jaijo T. Rüschendorf F. Saar K. et al.A genetic basis for mechanosensory traits in humans.PLoS Biol. 2012; 10: e1001318Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Stevens and Choo, 1998Stevens J.C. Choo K.K. Temperature sensitivity of the body surface over the life span.Somatosens. Mot. Res. 1998; 15: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In warm- and cool-trained mice, peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of the lick latencies showed that first lick responses to cooling peaked within the first second of stimulation; however, the timing of first licks to warm were more variable (Figures S1G–S1I). Warm-trained mice reported the stimulus with a mean latency of 0.87 ± 0.07 s compared to just 0.31 ± 0.03 s for cool-trained mice (n = 12 warm-trained mice, n = 7 cool trained mice; data from the training session with shortest mean latency among sessions with d′ >1.5, p < 0.0001; Figures S1I and S4E). Consistently longer latencies for warm compared to cool were observed in all training sessions (Figures S1J and S1K). Overall, these data indicate that mice sense warm with poorer spatial and temporal resolution than for cool. To investigate whether mice are able to discriminate warming from cooling, we inserted randomly timed cooling stimuli into a warm stimulus detection session (Figure S2A). Warm-trained mice did not lick in response to cooling, indicating that mice correctly discriminate cooling from warming. Interestingly, warm-trained mice licked during the warming phase of the inserted cooling stimulus (n = 7 mice; Figure S2B). Similarly, we inserted warm stimuli into cool detection sessions (n = 7 mice; Figure S2C). Cool-trained mice withheld licking to the inserted warm stimulus and only responded during the cooling phases of the warm stimulus (Figure S2D). Thus, in this task, mice learn to report the direction of temperature change rather than its absolute value. We next asked which populations of cutaneous sensory neurons convey perceptually relevant warming information to the CNS. Using an ex vivo skin-nerve preparation of the medial and ulnar nerves innervating the glabrous skin of the forepaw (Walcher et al., 2018Walcher J. Ojeda-Alonso J. Haseleu J. Oosthuizen M.K. Rowe A.H. Bennett N.C. Lewin G.R. Specialized mechanoreceptor systems in rodent glabrous skin.J. Physiol. 2018; 596: 4995-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we recorded from temperature-sensitive single fibers using a 1°C/s heating or cooling ramp (warming, 32°C to 48°C; cooling, 32°C to 12°C). We surveyed all types of fibers and characterized in detail those with thermally driven activity. All warm-driven fibers increased their firing rate monotonically as temperature increased (Figures 2A and 2B ). This was also true of C-fibers innervating hindpaw glabrous skin (n = 152 fibers tested; data not shown). The majority of thermally driven afferents could be classified as polymodal C-fibers. These polymodal afferents had conduction velocities below 1.2 ms−1, showed little or no ongoing firing, and were robustly activated by mechanical stimuli. C-fibers can simply be classified according to the types of stimulus modalities that activate them (Fleischer et al., 1983Fleischer E. Handwerker H.O. Joukhadar S. Unmyelinated nociceptive units in two skin areas of the rat.Brain Res. 1983; 267: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, Lewin and Mendell, 1994Lewin G.R. Mendell L.M. Regulation of cutaneous C-fiber heat nociceptors by nerve growth factor in the developing rat.J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 71: 941-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); thus, fibers responding only to mechanical and heat stimuli are termed C-mechanoheat (C-MH; 20/37), to mechanical heat and cold C-mechanoheatcold (C-MHC; 6/37), or mechanical and cold stimuli C-mechanocold (C-MC; 7/37) (Figure 2C). Only two fibers without a mechanosensitive receptive field were found and classified as C-cold fibers (C-C; 2/37), and a further two afferents (2/9) with Aδ-fiber conduction velocities (1.2–10 ms−1) were found to be temperature sensitive and classified as A-MH (n = 1) and A-MC (n = 1) (Figure 2C). The majority of polymodal C-fibers (C-MH, C-MC, and C-MHC) responded to non-noxious temperatures, defined as spiking to stimuli below 42°C for warming or above 22°C for cooling (Figure 2D). None of the C-C or Aδ-fibers responded to non-noxious temperatures (Figure 2D). We stimulated thermosensitive C-fibers with a series of 4 s warming and cooling stimuli with the same temporal features used in behavioral experiments (Figure 2E). PSTHs of spike latency during 32°C–42°C warm stimuli demonstrated that sparse warm-evoked spiking is observed within the first few hundred milliseconds after stimulus onset, but firing activity peaked later (Figure 2F). The mean C-fiber spike rate increased with increasing warm step amplitude (Figure 2F). Two warm-sensitive C-MH fibers were found to be activated by a 1°C warm step (32°C–33°C), the smallest warm step reliably detected by the mouse (Figure 1E). Firing was sparse with such small stimuli, consistent with the need for spatial summation to detect warm (Figure S1A). Like previous studies on rodent nociceptors (Koltzenburg et al., 1997Koltzenburg M. Stucky C.L. Lewin G.R. Receptive properties of mouse sensory neurons innervating hairy skin.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1841-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, Lynn and Carpenter, 1982Lynn B. Carpenter S.E.

Protoc. 2009; 4: 174-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we made ex vivo skin-nerve recordings with a bath temperature of 32°C. We had assumed that paw skin temperature in the mouse is 32°C; however, thermal imaging of awake mice revealed that forepaw skin temperature is between 26°C and 28°C (Figure 3A). To mimic the skin temperature during behavior, we re-investigated the thermosensory profile of forepaw afferents with the bath temperature maintained at 27°C (Figure 3A) but with the same Peltier baseline (32°C) and temperature steps as before. Again, most heat- and cool-responsive units were polymodal C-fibers (Figure S3A). Intriguingly, we observed a new population of C-fibers with ongoing spike activity in the absence of externally applied thermal stimuli (Figure 3B). These fibers are reminiscent of low-threshold cold receptors in the cornea (Belmonte et al., 2009Belmonte C. Brock J.A. Viana F. Converting cold into pain.Exp. Brain Res. 2009; 196: 13-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and may correspond to recently described menthol-sensitive Vglut3lineage sensory neurons described in vitro with ongoing activity (Griffith et al., 2019Griffith T.N. Docter T.A. Lumpkin E.A. Tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels mediate action potential firing and excitability in menthol-sensitive Vglut3-lineage sensory neurons.J. Neurosci. 2019; 39: 7086-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The physiological properties of these fibers closely resembled thermally responsive units recorded in humans (Campero and Bostock, 2010Campero M. Bostock H.

Sensory receptors with unmyelinated (C) fibers innervating the skin of the rabbit’s ear.J. Neurophysiol. 1985; 54: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). C-fibers with ongoing activity at 27°C made up 19% of all thermosensitive fibers recorded and were further characterized as polymodal C-fibers (5 C-MCs and 1 C-MHC). Fibers with ongoing activity displayed firing rates at 27°C between 0.2 and 6 Hz and increased firing to cooling and decreased firing to warming (Figure 3C). We plotted PSTHs of C-fiber firing to the 32°C–42°C warm ramp used for behavioral training. Warm stimuli activated a separate population of polymodal C-fibers with a time course that mirrored the inhibition of cool-sensitive fibers with ongoing activity (Figure 3D). Cooling ramps from 32°C to 22°C evoked robust firing in a larger population of polymodal C-fibers (C-MCs and C-MHCs; Figure S3G), which included all fibers with ongoing activity at 27°C (Figure 3E). Using small step changes in thermal ramps (illustrated in Figure 3B), we probed how firing rates changed with temperature in cool-sensitive fibers with ongoing activity. As expected, these C-fibers increased their firing rates with cooling and were progressively silenced by warming (Figure 3F). C-fibers with monotonically increasing firing rates to increasing temperature represented the majority of thermosensitive afferents (Figures S3D–S3F). However, we also observed small populations of cool-responsive fibers and warm-responsive afferent fibers that only responded to specific ranges of temperatures and were inhibited by noxious temperatures (Figures S3D–S3F). Warm-preferring units that stopped firing at noxious heat temperatures during the 1°C/s heat ramp were only found in experiments where the skin was maintained at 27°C and not at 32°C, while cool-preferring units were found in both sets of experiments (Figure S3F). We next examined warm perception at lower baseline temperatures. We trained mice at a baseline of 22°C to report a 10°C warm step (22°C–32°C). Mice quickly learned the task (n = 6 mice, p < 0.0001 since training session 2; Figures 4A and S4A) and had a detection threshold of just 0.5°C (Figure 4B). In the same mice, we then shifted the baseline to 32°C and delivered 10°C steps. Detection of 10°C warm steps from 22°C baseline was more robust than from 32°C baseline (n = 6 mice, p < 0.005, mean d′ = 3.43 ± 0.26 versus 2.05 ± 0.36; Figure 4C). Mice trained to report warm of 22°C–32°C displayed faster detection latencies than those trained at 32°C–42°C (n = 6 and n = 12 mice respectively, p < 0.05, 0.59 ± 0.04 s versus 0.87 ± 0.07 s; Figures S4D–S4F). In addition, mice reported a 10°C cooling step from a 22°C baseline (n = 6, p < 0.0001 from session 1; Figures S4B–S4D), but here, response latency increased from 0.31 ± 0.03 s in mice trained to report 32°C to 22°C (n = 7 mice) to 0.75 ± 0.06 s in mice trained to report 22°C to 12°C (n = 6 mice) (p < 0.0001; Figures S4E and S3F). These data indicate that warm perception is more acute at lower baseline temperature values. Next, we compared perceptual performance with afferent responses with a bath temperature 27°C to mimic paw temperature and a Peltier baseline of 22°C. Here, we found cool-sensitive fibers with ongoing spiking rates similar to those found with a bath temperature of 27°C (Figure 4D), which were silenced by a 22°C–32°C warming step (Figure 4E). We also recorded cool-excited fibers that increased their firing rates to a 22°C to 12°C cold stimulus (Figure S4H). Interestingly, we also observed warm excited C-MH and C-MHC fibers, but these fibers were only sparsely and weakly activated compared to when warm"

Hence, the development of a highly sensitive sensing element to detect pesticide residues is crucial for food safety and ecosystem protection. Optical methods based on fluorescence properties provide an ideal approach for screening and quantification of these compounds in different medias including water, plant, and nutritional products. The development of fluorescence emitting carbon dot-based sensors for monitoring pesticides has attracted great attention in recent years. In comparison to other fluorophores, carbon dots have more promising optical features, higher quantum yields and better biocompatibility. This article aims to present a novel fluorescent sensing method of diazinon, glyphosate, and amicarbazone using plant-based carbon dots. A comprehensive characterization of carbon dots obtained from cauliflower was performed by methods including UV-visible, FTIR spectroscopy, fluorometry, AFM, DLS, and zeta sizer. Following this step, carbon dots were used to detect pesticides. The fluorescence quenching property of carbon dots has been utilized to identify detection limit of 0.25, 0.5, and 2 ng ml-1 for diazinon, amicarbazone, and glyphosate, respectively. Also, real sample study revealed that the detection of pesticides accompanied by our developed nano-sensor is repeatable and accurate. According to carbon dots specificity determination, the prepared nano sensor does not have the potential to identify “bromacil” and “dialen super” pesticides but the other three mentioned pesticides are detectable. The results confirm that synthesized green carbon dots are well qualified for application in food safety and environmental monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3012701165,"Machine learning algorithms are currently being implemented in an escalating manner to classify and/or predict the onset of some neurodegenerative diseases; including Alzheimer's Disease (AD); this could be attributed to the fact of the abundance of data and powerful computers. The objective of this work was to deliver a robust classification system for AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) against healthy controls (HC) in a low-cost network in terms of shallow architecture and processing. In this study, the dataset included was downloaded from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI). The classification methodology implemented was the convolutional neural network (CNN), where the diffusion maps, and gray-matter (GM) volumes were the input images. The number of scans included was 185, 106, and 115 for HC, MCI and AD respectively. Ten-fold cross-validation scheme was adopted and the stacked mean diffusivity (MD) and GM volume produced an AUC of 0.94 and 0.84, an accuracy of 93.5% and 79.6%, a sensitivity of 92.5% and 62.7%, and a specificity of 93.9% and 89% for AD/HC and MCI/HC classification respectively. This work elucidates the impact of incorporating data from different imaging modalities; i.e. structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), where deep learning was employed for the aim of classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing the impact of having more than one scan per subject and propose the proper maneuver to confirm the robustness of the system. The results were competitive among the existing literature, which paves the way for improving medications that could slow down the progress of the AD or prevent it."
https://openalex.org/W3012579830,"A phenomenon of genetic compensation is commonly observed when an organism with a disease-bearing mutation shows incomplete penetrance of the disease phenotype. Such incomplete phenotypic penetrance, or genetic compensation, is more commonly found in stable knockout models, rather than transient knockdown models. As such, these incidents present a challenge for the disease modeling field, although a deeper understanding of genetic compensation may also hold the key for novel therapeutic interventions. In our study we created a knockout model of slc25a46 gene, which is a recently discovered important player in mitochondrial dynamics, and deleterious mutations in which are known to cause peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy and cerebellar ataxia. We report a case of genetic compensation in a stable slc25a46 homozygous zebrafish mutant (hereafter referred as “mutant”), in contrast to a penetrant disease phenotype in the first generation (F0) slc25a46 mosaic mutant (hereafter referred as “crispant”), generated with CRISPR/Cas-9 technology. We show that the crispant phenotype is specific and rescuable. By performing mRNA sequencing, we define significant changes in slc25a46 mutant’s gene expression profile, which are largely absent in crispants. We find that among the most significantly altered mRNAs, anxa6 gene stands out as a functionally relevant player in mitochondrial dynamics. We also find that our genetic compensation case does not arise from mechanisms driven by mutant mRNA decay. Our study contributes to the growing evidence of the genetic compensation phenomenon and presents novel insights about Slc25a46 function. Furthermore, our study provides the evidence for the efficiency of F0 CRISPR screens for disease candidate genes, which may be used to advance the field of functional genetics."
https://openalex.org/W3012772810,"Key events in the pathogenesis of Sjӧgren syndrome (SS) include the change of salivary gland epithelial cells into antigen-presenting cell-like phenotypes and focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (FLS). However, what triggers these features in SS is unknown. Dysbiosis of the gut and oral microbiomes is a potential environmental factor in SS, but its connection to the etiopathogenesis of SS remains unclear. This study aimed to characterize the oral microbiota in SS and to investigate its potential role in the pathogenesis of SS. Oral bacterial communities were collected by whole mouthwash from control subjects (14 without oral dryness and 11 with dryness) and primary SS patients (8 without oral dryness and 17 with dryness) and were analyzed by pyrosequencing. The SS oral microbiota was characterized by an increased bacterial load and Shannon diversity. Through comparisons of control and SS in combined samples and then separately in non-dry and dry conditions, SS-associated taxa independent of dryness were identified. Three SS-associated species and 2 control species were selected and used to challenge human submandibular gland tumor (HSG) cells. Among the selected SS-associated bacterial species, Prevotella melaninogenica uniquely upregulated the expression of MHC molecules, CD80, and IFNλ in HSG cells. Concomitantly, P. melaninogenica efficiently invaded HSG cells. Sections of labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsies from 8 non-SS subjects and 15 SS patients were subjected to in situ hybridization using universal and P. melaninogenica-specific probes. Ductal cells and the areas of infiltration were heavily infected with bacteria in the LSGs with FLS. Collectively, dysbiotic oral microbiota may initiate the deregulation of SGECs and the IFN signature through bacterial invasion into ductal cells. These findings may provide new insights into the etiopathogenesis of SS."
https://openalex.org/W3012630811,"Backgrounds MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of non-protein-coding RNAs that have significant biological and pathological functions. The importance of miRNAs as potential cancer diagnostic biomarkers is gaining attention due to their influence in the regulation of cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. The aim of this study was to identify significant miRNAs from saliva as potential diagnostic biomarkers in the early diagnosis and prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Materials and methods Five differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-7703, miR- let-7a-5p, miR- 345-5p, miR- 3928 and miR- 1470) were selected from Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) miRNA data generated from our previous study using saliva of 12 HNSCC patients and 12 healthy controls. Their differential expressed miRNAs were subsequently validated by RT-qPCR using saliva samples from healthy controls (n = 80) and HNSCC patients (n = 150). Total RNA was isolated from 150 saliva samples of HNSCC patients and was transcripted into cDNA by TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit. Using quantitative RT-PCR analysis, salivary miRNAs were identified in HNSCC patients (n = 150) and healthy controlled cases (n = 80). T-tests were used to compare the differences among the various clinical variants. Results On average 160 ng/μl was isolated from 500 μl of saliva. Overall, a good correlation observed between the HNSCC and some of miRNAs expression levels. Salivary miR-let-7a-5p (P<0.0001) and miR-3928 (P< 0.01) were significantly down regulated in saliva of HNSCC patients relative to age and sex-matched healthy controls. A number of salivary miRNAs (miR-let-7a-5p and miR-3928) were correlated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.003, p = 0.049) and tumour size (p = 0.01, p = 0.02), respectively. However, our preliminary analysis showed no significant differences in salivary miR-1470, miR-345-5p or miR-7703 expression between patients and healthy controls. Most notably, our analysis showed that salivary miR-let-7a-5p and miR-3928 expression levels have significant sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between patients with HNSCC and healthy controls. Conclusion This study concluded that salivary miR-let-7a-5p and miR-3928 has the potential to be novel non-invasive biomarkers for early detection and prognosis of HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W3012775084,"Coral reefs are biologically diverse and structurally complex ecosystems, which have been severally affected by human actions. Consequently, there is a need for rapid ecological assessment of coral reefs, but current approaches require time consuming manual analysis, either during a dive survey or on images collected during a survey. Reef structural complexity is essential for ecological function but is challenging to measure and often relegated to simple metrics such as rugosity. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning offer the potential to alleviate some of these limitations. We developed an approach to automatically classify 3D reconstructions of reef sections and assessed the accuracy of this approach. 3D reconstructions of reef sections were generated using commercial Structure-from-Motion software with images extracted from video surveys. To generate a 3D classified map, locations on the 3D reconstruction were mapped back into the original images to extract multiple views of the location. Several approaches were tested to merge information from multiple views of a point into a single classification, all of which used convolutional neural networks to classify or extract features from the images, but differ in the strategy employed for merging information. Approaches to merging information entailed voting, probability averaging, and a learned neural-network layer. All approaches performed similarly achieving overall classification accuracies of ~96% and >90% accuracy on most classes. With this high classification accuracy, these approaches are suitable for many ecological applications."
https://openalex.org/W3012808149,"Natural microbial communities contain hundreds to thousands of interacting species. For this reason, computational simulations are playing an increasingly important role in microbial ecology. In this manuscript, we present a new open-source, freely available Python package called Community Simulator for simulating microbial population dynamics in a reproducible, transparent and scalable way. The Community Simulator includes five major elements: tools for preparing the initial states and environmental conditions for a set of samples, automatic generation of dynamical equations based on a dictionary of modeling assumptions, random parameter sampling with tunable levels of metabolic and taxonomic structure, parallel integration of the dynamical equations, and support for metacommunity dynamics with migration between samples. To significantly speed up simulations using Community Simulator, our Python package implements a new Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for finding equilibrium states of community dynamics that exploits a recently discovered duality between ecological dynamics and convex optimization. We present data showing that this EM algorithm improves performance by between one and two orders compared to direct numerical integration of the corresponding ordinary differential equations. We conclude by listing several recent applications of the Community Simulator to problems in microbial ecology, and discussing possible extensions of the package for directly analyzing microbiome compositional data."
https://openalex.org/W3012896205,"The chloroplast genome harbors plenty of valuable information for phylogenetic research. Illumina short-read data is generally used for de novo assembly of whole plastomes. PacBio or Oxford Nanopore long reads are additionally employed in hybrid approaches to enable assembly across the highly similar inverted repeats of a chloroplast genome. Unlike for PacBio, plastome assemblies based solely on Nanopore reads are rarely found, due to their high error rate and non-random error profile. However, the actual quality decline connected to their use has rarely been quantified. Furthermore, no study has employed reference-based assembly using Nanopore reads, which is common with Illumina data. Using Leucanthemum Mill. as an example, we compared the sequence quality of seven chloroplast genome assemblies of the same species, using combinations of two sequencing platforms and three analysis pipelines. In addition, we assessed the factors which might influence Nanopore assembly quality during sequence generation and bioinformatic processing. The consensus sequence derived from de novo assembly of Nanopore data had a sequence identity of 99.59% compared to Illumina short-read de novo assembly. Most of the errors detected were indels (81.5%), and a large majority of them is part of homopolymer regions. The quality of reference-based assembly is heavily dependent upon the choice of a close-enough reference. When using a reference with 0.83% sequence divergence from the studied species, mapping of Nanopore reads results in a consensus comparable to that from Nanopore de novo assembly, and of only slightly inferior quality compared to a reference-based assembly with Illumina data. For optimal de novo assembly of Nanopore data, appropriate filtering of contaminants and chimeric sequences, as well as employing moderate read coverage, is essential. Based on these results, we conclude that Nanopore long reads are a suitable alternative to Illumina short reads in plastome phylogenomics. Few errors remain in the finalized assembly, which can be easily masked in phylogenetic analyses without loss in analytical accuracy. The easily applicable and cost-effective technology might warrant more attention by researchers dealing with plant chloroplast genomes."
https://openalex.org/W3012694525,"Protein- and starch-related quality traits, which are quantitatively inherited and significantly influenced by the environment, are critical determinants of the end-use quality of wheat. We constructed a high-density genetic map containing 10,739 loci (5,399 unique loci) using a set of 184 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross of ‘Tainong 18 × Linmai 6’ (TL-RILs). In this study, a quantitative trait loci (QTLs) analysis was used to examine the genetic control of grain protein content, sedimentation value, farinograph parameters, falling number and the performance of the starch pasting properties using TL-RILs grown in a field for three years. A total of 106 QTLs for 13 quality traits were detected, distributed on the 21 chromosomes. Of these, 38 and 68 QTLs for protein- and starch-related traits, respectively, were detected in three environments and their average values (AV). Twenty-six relatively high-frequency QTLs (RHF-QTLs) that were detected in more than two environments. Twelve stable QTL clusters containing at least one RHF-QTL were detected and classified into three types: detected only for protein-related traits (type I), detected only for starch-related traits (type II), and detected for both protein- and starch-related traits (type III). A total of 339 markers flanked with 11 QTL clusters (all except C6), were found to be highly homologous with 282 high confidence (HC) and 57 low confidence (LC) candidate genes based on IWGSC RefSeq v 1.0. These stable QTLs and RHF-QTLs, especially those grouped into clusters, are credible and should be given priority for QTL fine-mapping and identification of candidate genes with which to explain the molecular mechanisms of quality development and inform marker-assisted breeding in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3012720863,"Deaths from ovarian cancer usually occur when patients succumb to overwhelmingly numerous and widespread micrometastasis. Whereas epithelial–mesenchymal transition is required for epithelial ovarian cancer cells to acquire metastatic potential, the cellular phenotype at secondary sites and the mechanisms required for the establishment of metastatic tumors are not fully determined. Using in vitro and in vivo models we show that secondary epithelial ovarian cancer cells (sEOC) do not fully reacquire the molecular signature of the primary epithelial ovarian cancer cells from which they are derived. Despite displaying an epithelial morphology, sEOC maintains a high expression of the mesenchymal effector, TWIST-1. TWIST-1 is however transcriptionally nonfunctional in these cells as it is precluded from binding its E-box by the PcG protein, CBX7. Deletion of CBX7 in sEOC was sufficient to reactivate TWIST-1-induced transcription, prompt mesenchymal transformation, and enhanced tumorigenicity in vivo. This regulation allows secondary tumors to achieve an epithelial morphology while conferring the advantage of prompt reversal to a mesenchymal phenotype upon perturbation of CBX7. We also describe a subclassification of ovarian tumors based on CBX7 and TWIST-1 expression, which predicts clinical outcomes and patient prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3013336954,"Assembled α-synuclein in nerve cells and glial cells is the defining pathological feature of neurodegenerative diseases called synucleinopathies. Seeds of α-synuclein can induce the assembly of monomeric protein. Here, we used sucrose gradient centrifugation and transiently transfected HEK 293T cells to identify the species of α-synuclein from the brains of homozygous, symptomatic mice transgenic for human mutant A53T α-synuclein (line M83) that seed aggregation. The most potent fractions contained Sarkosyl-insoluble assemblies enriched in filaments. We also analyzed six cases of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), one case of familial PD, and six cases of multiple system atrophy (MSA) for their ability to induce α-synuclein aggregation. The MSA samples were more potent than those of idiopathic PD in seeding aggregation. We found that following sucrose gradient centrifugation, the most seed-competent fractions from PD and MSA brains are those that contain Sarkosyl-insoluble α-synuclein. The fractions differed between PD and MSA, consistent with the presence of distinct conformers of assembled α-synuclein in these different samples. We conclude that α-synuclein filaments are the main driving force for amplification and propagation of pathology in synucleinopathies."
https://openalex.org/W3012766907,"Stress fractures are common amongst healthy military recruits and athletes. Reduced vitamin D availability, measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) status, has been associated with stress fracture risk during the 32-week Royal Marines (RM) training programme. A gene-environment interaction study was undertaken to explore this relationship to inform specific injury risk mitigation strategies. Fifty-one males who developed a stress fracture during RM training (n = 9 in weeks 1–15; n = 42 in weeks 16–32) and 141 uninjured controls were genotyped for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) FokI polymorphism. Serum 25OHD was measured at the start, middle and end (weeks 1, 15 and 32) of training. Serum 25OHD concentration increased in controls between weeks 1–15 (61.8±29.1 to 72.6±28.8 nmol/L, p = 0.01). Recruits who fractured did not show this rise and had lower week-15 25OHD concentration (p = 0.01). Higher week-15 25OHD concentration was associated with reduced stress fracture risk (adjusted OR 0.55[0.32–0.96] per 1SD increase, p = 0.04): the greater the increase in 25OHD, the greater the protective effect (p = 0.01). The f-allele was over-represented in fracture cases compared with controls (p<0.05). Baseline 25OHD status interacted with VDR genotype: a higher level was associated with reduced fracture risk in f-allele carriers (adjusted OR 0.39[0.17–0.91], p = 0.01). Improved 25OHD status between weeks 1–15 had a greater protective effect in FF genotype individuals (adjusted OR 0.31[0.12–0.81] vs. 1.78[0.90–3.49], p<0.01). Stress fracture risk in RM recruits is impacted by the interaction of VDR genotype with vitamin D status. This further supports the role of low serum vitamin D concentrations in causing stress fractures, and hence prophylactic vitamin D supplementation as an injury risk mitigation strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3012575543,"Carbon monoxide (CO) remains the most common cause of human poisoning. The consequences of CO poisoning include cardiac dysfunction, brain injury, and death. CO causes toxicity by binding to hemoglobin and by inhibiting mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), thereby decreasing oxygen delivery and inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation. We have recently developed a CO antidote based on human neuroglobin (Ngb-H64Q-CCC). This molecule enhances clearance of CO from red blood cells in vitro and in vivo. Herein, we tested whether Ngb-H64Q-CCC can also scavenge CO from CcO and attenuate CO-induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Heart tissue from mice exposed to 3% CO exhibited a 42 ± 19% reduction in tissue respiration rate and a 33 ± 38% reduction in CcO activity compared with unexposed mice. Intravenous infusion of Ngb-H64Q-CCC restored respiration rates to that of control mice correlating with higher electron transport chain CcO activity in Ngb-H64Q-CCC–treated compared with PBS-treated, CO-poisoned mice. Further, using a Clark-type oxygen electrode, we measured isolated rat liver mitochondrial respiration in the presence and absence of saturating solutions of CO (160 μm) and nitric oxide (100 μm). Both CO and NO inhibited respiration, and treatment with Ngb-H64Q-CCC (100 and 50 μm, respectively) significantly reversed this inhibition. These results suggest that Ngb-H64Q-CCC mitigates CO toxicity by scavenging CO from carboxyhemoglobin, improving systemic oxygen delivery and reversing the inhibitory effects of CO on mitochondria.

https://openalex.org/W3012682077,"Prostate cancer (PCa) innervation contributes to the progression of PCa. However, the precise impact of innervation on PCa cells is still poorly understood. By focusing on muscarinic receptors, which are activated by the nerve-derived neurotransmitter acetylcholine, we show that muscarinic receptors 1 and 3 (m1 and m3) are highly expressed in PCa clinical specimens compared with all other cancer types, and that amplification or gain of their corresponding encoding genes (CHRM1 and CHRM3, respectively) represent a worse prognostic factor for PCa progression free survival. Moreover, m1 and m3 gene gain or amplification is frequent in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) compared with hormone-sensitive PCa (HSPC) specimens. This was reflected in HSPC-derived cells, which show aberrantly high expression of m1 and m3 under androgen deprivation mimicking castration and androgen receptor inhibition. We also show that pharmacological activation of m1 and m3 signaling is sufficient to induce the castration-resistant growth of PCa cells. Mechanistically, we found that m1 and m3 stimulation induces YAP activation through FAK, whose encoding gene, PTK2 is frequently amplified in CRPC cases. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK and knockdown of YAP abolished m1 and m3-induced castration-resistant growth of PCa cells. Our findings provide novel therapeutic opportunities for muscarinic-signal-driven CRPC progression by targeting the FAK-YAP signaling axis."
https://openalex.org/W3012736398,"Abstract Glioblastoma multiforme is characterized in part by severe hypoxia associated with tumor necrosis. The cellular response to hypoxia can influence several properties of tumor cells associated with aggressive tumor growth, including metabolic adaptations and tumor cell migration and invasion. Here, we found that Delta Like Non-Canonical Notch Ligand 1 (DLK1) expression was elevated as compared with normal brain in a genetically engineered mouse model of glioma, and that DLK1 expression increased with tumor grade in human glioma samples. DLK1 expression was highest in hypoxic and perivascular tumor areas, and we found that hypoxia induced the release and nuclear translocation of an intracellular fragment of DLK1 in murine glioma as well as in human glioma cultures. Release of the intracellular fragment was dependent on ADAM17 and Hypoxia-inducible Factor 1alpha and 2alpha (HIF-1alpha/HIF-2alpha), as ADAM17 inhibitors and HIF1A / HIF2A siRNA blocked DLK1 cleavage. Expression of a cleavable form of DLK1 amplified several hypoxia-induced traits of glioma cells such as colony formation, stem cell marker gene expression, a PI3K-pathway-mediated metabolic shift, and enhanced invasiveness. Effects of DLK1 were dependent on DLK1-cleavage by ADAM17, as expression of non-cleavable DLK1 could not replicate the DLK1-induced hypoxic phenotype. Finally, forced expression of DLK1 resulted in more invasive tumor growth in a PDGFB-induced glioma mouse model without affecting overall survival. Together, our findings suggest a previously undescribed role for DLK1 as an intracellular signaling molecule."
https://openalex.org/W3012660709,"Background Human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common sexually transmitted disease, is involved in a series of other diseases. The persistent infection of high-risk HPVs (HR-HPVs) is considered to be the causative agent of cervical cancer, and it is related to noncervical cancers. The present study aims to estimate the HPV prevalence and genotype distribution in Jilin province, China, to guide HPV-related cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination. Methods From October 2017 to September 2019, 21,282 samples (634 male and 20,648 female) were collected for HPV infection detection using an HPV genotyping panel. The age-related HPV prevalence and morbidity of HPV-based disease and HPV prevalence associated with specific diseases were analyzed. Results A total of 7095 (34.4%) positive for HPV infection of 20648 women, and 164 (25.8%) positive of 634 men. The HPV prevalence among women exhibited a bimodal pattern, with a peak in young group and a second peak in old group, with increased severity of cervical lesions. HPV16 (7.8%), HPV52 (5.8%), HPV58 (5.0%), HPV53 (3.4%), and HPV51 (3.0%) were the most prevalent genotypes among women, and HPV6 (6.0%), HPV11 (5.7%), HPV16 (3.6%), HPV18 (2.7%), and HPV51 (3.0%) were prevalent among men. Non-vaccine-covered HPV53 and 51 were found in 6.3% of HPV infection and 8.9% of cervical cancer in Jilin province. Furthermore, 45.5% of females and 28.6% of males with genital warts were infected with HR-HPV genotypes. Conclusion The HPV genotypic spectrum in Jilin province, where non-vaccine-covered HPV53 and 51 were prevalent, exhibited an age- and cervical lesion-specific pattern, which provides guidance for HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening. HPV infection in men and benign hyper-proliferative lesions should not be neglected."

Nine-weeks after the first immunisation, LV function was assessed by pulsed Doppler, tissue Doppler imaging and Speckle tracking echocardiography. Cardiac collagen content was determined by picrosirius red staining; circulating inflammatory markers were measured using ELISA. Results Compared to controls (n = 12), CIA rats had reduced myocardial relaxation as indexed by lateral e’ (early diastolic mitral annular velocity) and e’/a’ (early-to-late diastolic mitral annular velocity) and increased filling pressures as indexed by E/e’. No differences in ejection fraction and LV endocardial fractional shortening between the groups were recorded. LV global radial and circumferential strain and strain rate were reduced in CIA rats compared to controls. Higher concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers were associated with reduced lateral e’, e’/a’, radial and circumferential strain and strain rate. Greater collagen content was associated with increased concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers and E/e’. Conclusion High-grade inflammation is associated with impaired LV diastolic function and greater myocardial deformation independent of haemodynamic load in CIA rats."

In this study, we discovered that soluble endorepellin activates the canonical stress signaling pathway consisting of PERK, eIF2α, ATF4, and GADD45α. Specifically, endorepellin evoked transient activation of VEGFR2, which, in turn, phosphorylated PERK at Thr980. Subsequently, PERK phosphorylated eIF2α at Ser51, upregulating its downstream effector proteins ATF4 and GADD45α. RNAi-mediated knockdown of PERK or eIF2α abrogated the endorepellin-mediated up-regulation of GADD45α, the ultimate effector protein of this stress signaling cascade. To functionally validate these findings, we utilized an ex vivo model of angiogenesis. Exposure of the aortic rings embedded in 3D fibrillar collagen to recombinant endorepellin for 2–4 h activated PERK and induced GADD45α vis à vis vehicle-treated counterparts. Similar effects were obtained with the established cellular stress inducer tunicamycin. Notably, chronic exposure of aortic rings to endorepellin for 7–9 days markedly suppressed vessel sprouting, an angiostatic effect that was rescued by blocking PERK kinase activity. Our findings unravel a mechanism by which an extracellular matrix protein evokes stress signaling in endothelial cells, which leads to angiostasis.

https://openalex.org/W3012952118,"Pathological accumulation of microtubule associated protein tau in neurons is a major neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Several attempts have been made to promote clearance of pathological tau (p-Tau) from neurons. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) has shown to clear p-Tau from neurons via autophagy. However, sustained TFEB activation and autophagy can create burden on cellular bioenergetics and can be deleterious. Here, we modified previously described two-plasmid systems of Light Activated Protein (LAP) from bacterial transcription factor—EL222 and Light Responsive Element (LRE) to encode TFEB. Upon blue-light (465 nm) illumination, the conformation changes in LAP induced LRE-driven expression of TFEB, its nuclear entry, TFEB-mediated expression of autophagy-lysosomal genes and clearance of p-Tau from neuronal cells and AD patient-derived human iPSC-neurons. Turning the blue-light off reversed the expression of TFEB-target genes and attenuated p-Tau clearance. Together, these results suggest that optically regulated TFEB expression unlocks the potential of opto-therapeutics to treat AD and other dementias."
https://openalex.org/W3012626108,"Background Hypercapnia during breath holding is believed to be the dominant driver behind the modulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, increasing evidence show that mild hypoxia and mild hypercapnia in breath hold (BH) could work synergistically to enhance CBF response. We hypothesized that breath-by-breath O2-CO2 exchange ratio (bER), defined as the ratio of the change in partial pressure of oxygen (ΔPO2) to that of carbon dioxide (ΔPCO2) between end inspiration and end expiration, would be able to better correlate with the global and regional cerebral hemodynamic responses (CHR) to BH challenge. We aimed to investigate whether bER is a more useful index than end-tidal PCO2 to characterize cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) under BH challenge. Methods We used transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to evaluate CHR under BH challenge by measuring cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the middle cerebral arteries. Regional changes in CHR to BH and exogenous CO2 challenges were mapped with blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal changes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We correlated respiratory gas exchange (RGE) metrics (bER, ΔPO2, ΔPCO2, end-tidal PCO2 and PO2, and time of breaths) with CHR (CBFv and BOLD) to BH challenge. Temporal features and frequency characteristics of RGE metrics and their coherence with CHR were examined. Results CHR to brief BH epochs and free breathing were coupled with both ΔPO2 and ΔPCO2. We found that bER was superior to either ΔPO2 or ΔPCO2 alone in coupling with the changes of CBFv and BOLD signals under breath hold challenge. The regional CVR results derived by regressing BOLD signal changes on bER under BH challenge resembled those derived by regressing BOLD signal changes on end-tidal PCO2 under exogenous CO2 challenge. Conclusion Our findings provide a novel insight on the potential of using bER to better quantify CVR changes under BH challenge."
https://openalex.org/W3012736593,"Inflammatory bowel disease results from alterations in the immune system and intestinal microbiota. The role of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in maintaining gut homeostasis is well known and its perturbation often causes gastrointestinal disorders including IBD. The epithelial specific adaptor protein (AP)-1B is involved in the establishment of the polarity of IECs. Deficiency of the AP-1B μ subunit (Ap1m2-/-) leads to the development of chronic colitis in mice. However, how this deficiency affects the gut microbes and its potential functions remains elusive. To gain insights into the gut microbiome of Ap1m2-/- mice having the colitis phenotype, we undertook shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis of knockout mice. We found important links to the microbial features involved in altering various physiological pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, nutrient transportation, oxidative stress, and bacterial pathogenesis (cell motility). In addition, an increased abundance of sulfur-reducing and lactate-producing bacteria has been observed which may aggravate the colitis condition."
https://openalex.org/W3012674174,"Aortic dissection (AD) is a major cause of acute aortic syndrome with high mortality due to the destruction of aortic walls. Although recent studies indicate the critical role of inflammation in the disease mechanism of AD, it is unclear how inflammatory response is initiated. Here, we demonstrate that myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A), a signal transducer of humoral and mechanical stress, plays an important role in pathogenesis of AD in a mouse model. A mouse model of AD was created by continuous infusion of angiotensin II (AngII) that induced MRTF-A expression and caused AD in 4 days. Systemic deletion of Mrtfa gene resulted in a marked suppression of AD development. Transcriptome and gene annotation enrichment analyses revealed that AngII infusion for 1 day caused pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic responses before AD development, which were suppressed by Mrtfa deletion. AngII infusion for 1 day induced pro-inflammatory response, as demonstrated by expressions of Il6, Tnf, and Ccl2, and apoptosis of aortic wall cells, as detected by TUNEL staining, in an MRTF-A-dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of MRTF-A by CCG-203971 during AngII infusion partially suppressed AD phenotype, indicating that acute suppression of MRTF-A is effective in preventing the aortic wall destruction. These results indicate that MRTF-A transduces the stress of AngII challenge to the pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic responses, ultimately leading to AD development. Intervening this pathway may represent a potential therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3012812616,"Background To the best of our knowledge, studies are lacking on burnout among veterinary students in Serbia, and this is the first study trying to address such a problem. Therefore, the aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the predictors of burnout among Belgrade veterinary students. Methods Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and anonymous structured questionnaire addressed to personal data, health habits and stressful influence of educational process were applied among 496 respondents from a total of 1113 students from all grades in spring semester 2014 (response rate 44.6%). Results The prevalence of burnout was 43.3%. High scores on depersonalization and emotional exhaustion scales of MBI were found among 79.4% and 45.0% students, respectively; low personal accomplishment was reported by 50.5% students. Female students reported higher levels of emotional exhaustion compared to males (p = 0.012). A low score on personal achievement scale of MBI was least frequent among the freshmen and most frequent among sophomores (41.1% and 65.3%, respectively; p = 0.986). There were more students with burnout who considered their health as a worsened vs. pre-study period compared to students with no burnout, both concerning mental (61.4% vs. 38.6%) and physical health (61.1% vs. 38.9%; both p<0.001). There were more smokers among students who suffered from burnout compared to students who did not (52.0% vs. 48.0%; p = 0.013). A multiple regression revealed an independent dose-response effect of perceived stress at exams on the onset of burnout (moderate stress OR = 2.164 and high stress OR = 3.878). Also, students with the moderate and high stressful effect of communication with teaching staff, as well as, those with worse self-perceived physical and mental health had more than two times higher presence of burnout. Conclusions The prevalence of burnout among Belgrade veterinary students is relatively high. Primary prevention should be focused on the revealed predictors of burnout."

Incorporation of these molecules into newly synthesized DNA (i.e. pulse-labeling) is used to monitor cell proliferation or to isolate nascent DNA. Some of the most common nucleoside analogues used for pulse-labeling of DNA in cells are the deoxypyrimidine analogues 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxycytidine (EdC). Click chemistry enables conjugation of an azide molecule tagged with a fluorescent dye or biotin to the alkyne of the analog, which can then be used to detect incorporation of EdU and EdC into DNA. The use of EdC is often recommended because of the potential cytotoxicity associated with EdU during longer incubations. Here, by comparing the relative incorporation efficiencies of EdU and EdC during short 30-min pulses, we demonstrate significantly lower incorporation of EdC than of EdU in noninfected human fibroblast cells or in cells infected with either human cytomegalovirus or Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Interestingly, cells infected with herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) incorporated EdC and EdU at similar levels during short pulses. Of note, exogenous expression of HSV-1 thymidine kinase increased the incorporation efficiency of EdC. These results highlight the limitations when using substituted pyrimidine analogues in pulse-labeling and suggest that EdU is the preferable nucleoside analogue for short pulse-labeling experiments, resulting in increased recovery and sensitivity for downstream applications.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, coq1–coq9 deletion mutants are respiratory-incompetent, sensitive to lipid peroxidation stress, and unable to synthesize Q6. The yeast coq10 deletion mutant is also respiratory-deficient and sensitive to lipid peroxidation, yet it continues to produce Q6 at an impaired rate. Thus, Coq10 is required for the function of Q6 in respiration and as an antioxidant and is believed to chaperone Q6 from its site of synthesis to the respiratory complexes.

The presence of Coq10–Coq11 fusions in fungal species indicates that Coq11 may have a functional association with the Coq10 chaperone to facilitate or regulate Q6 transport for respiration in yeast. In this work, the functional relationship between Coq10 and Coq11 was investigated using a series of single- and double-knockout mutants. Deletion of COQ11 alleviated the coq10Δ respiratory defect, increased Coq polypeptides and CoQ synthome stability, and partially rescued Q6 production. Based on this evidence, we propose a novel function for Coq11 as a negative modulator of Q6 biosynthesis in the mitochondria. Previous phylogenetic analyses of numerous fungi revealed that Coq11-like proteins are fused to Coq10 (14Allan C.M. Awad A.M. Johnson J.S. Shirasaki D.I. Wang C. Blaby-Haas C.E. Merchant S.S.

Protein fusions often indicate a functional relationship between corresponding homologs in other organisms, such as direct protein–protein interaction or operation within the same biological pathway (15Marcotte E.M. Pellegrini M. Ng H.L. Rice D.W. Yeates T.O. Eisenberg D. Detecting protein function and protein–protein interactions from genome sequences.Science. 1999; 285 (10427000): 751-75310.1126/science.285.5428.751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Although Coq10 and Coq11 are not physically fused in yeast (Fig. 1A), we sought to investigate whether there is a functional link between the two proteins. Because protein localization is often associated with function, we first performed mitochondrial fractionation to localize both Coq10 and Coq11. Coq10 has been localized previously (18Barros M.H. Johnson A. Gin P. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Tzagoloff A. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae COQ10 gene encodes a START domain protein required for function of coenzyme Q in respiration.J. Biol.

S. cerevisiae mitochondria were fractionated as described under “Experimental procedures.” Purified mitochondria were incubated in hypotonic buffer to disrupt the outer membrane and release soluble components of the intermembrane space (IMS). The inner membrane was kept intact following hypotonic buffer treatment, protecting inner membrane and matrix proteins. Analysis of the fractions via immunoblot suggested that both Coq10 and Coq11 remained associated with the mitoplast fraction as opposed to colocalizing with the IMS marker cytochrome b2. Mitoplasts were further fractionated after sonication to separate soluble matrix components (supernatant, S) from membrane components (pellet, P). The soluble matrix marker Hsp60 was partially released into the supernatant by sonication as demonstrated in earlier work (26Reading D.S. Hallberg R.L. Myers A.M. Characterization of the yeast HSP60 gene coding for a mitochondrial assembly factor.Nature. 1989; 337 (2563898): 655-65910.1038/337655a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although Coq11 remained associated with the membrane fraction, Coq10 was partially dissociated in a similar manner to Hsp60 (Fig. 1B). Previous Coq10 colocalization following sonication demonstrated that Coq10 was solely associated with the membrane fraction (18Barros M.H. Johnson A. Gin P. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Tzagoloff A. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae COQ10 gene encodes a START domain protein required for function of coenzyme Q in respiration.J. Biol.

The detection of Coq10 in the supernatant shown in Fig. 1B may be due to increased sensitivity of the polyclonal antisera used in this study. Alternatively, mitoplasts were subjected to alkaline carbonate extraction to separate peripheral membrane components (supernatant, S) from integral membrane and matrix components (pellet, P) (27Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. Isolation of intracellular membranes by means of sodium carbonate treatment: application to endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93 (7068762): 97-10210.1083/jcb.93.1.97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Coq10 and Coq11 were released into the supernatant following alkaline treatment (Fig. 1B), matching the peripheral inner membrane marker Atp2 (28Chen W.J. Douglas M.G. Phosphodiester bond cleavage outside mitochondria is required for the completion of protein import into the mitochondrial matrix.Cell. 1987; 49 (3034431): 651-65810.1016/0092-8674(87)90541-1Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). There was no colocalization with the pellet fraction, marked by the integral membrane protein Cyt1 (29Ohashi A. Gibson J. Gregor I. Schatz G. Import of proteins into mitochondria.

These results indicate that Coq10 and Coq11 are both peripheral inner membrane proteins, and Coq10 has additional localization to the matrix. The localization of Coq10 to the inner membrane is consistent with its putative role as a START domain protein possessing a hydrophobic cavity to bind and chaperone Q6 from its site of synthesis to complex III for respiration (17Allan C.M.

https://openalex.org/W3012652893,"Endothelial dysfunction is a critical event in vascular inflammation characterized, in part, by elevated surface expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). ICAM-1 is heavily N-glycosylated, and like other surface proteins, it is largely presumed that fully processed, complex N-glycoforms are dominant. However, our recent studies suggest that hypoglycosylated or high mannose (HM)-ICAM-1 N-glycoforms are also expressed on the cell surface during endothelial dysfunction, and have higher affinity for monocyte adhesion and regulate outside-in endothelial signaling by different mechanisms. Whether different ICAM-1 N-glycoforms are expressed in vivo during disease is unknown. In this study, using the proximity ligation assay, we assessed the relative formation of high mannose, hybrid and complex α-2,6-sialyated N-glycoforms of ICAM-1 in human and mouse models of atherosclerosis, as well as in arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) of patients on hemodialysis. Our data demonstrates that ICAM-1 harboring HM or hybrid epitopes as well as ICAM-1 bearing α-2,6-sialylated epitopes are present in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions. Further, HM-ICAM-1 positively associated with increased macrophage burden in lesions as assessed by CD68 staining, whereas α-2,6-sialylated ICAM-1 did not. Finally, both HM and α-2,6-sialylated ICAM-1 N-glycoforms were present in hemodialysis patients who had AVF maturation failure compared to successful AVF maturation. Collectively, these data provide evidence that HM- ICAM-1 N-glycoforms are present in vivo, and at levels similar to complex α-2,6-sialylated ICAM-1 underscoring the need to better understand their roles in modulating vascular inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3012735097,"Introduction In Pediatrics, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) affect morbidity and mortality. In Mexico, the characteristics of ADRs and suspect drugs have not been described in hospitalized children. Objective To estimate the frequency of ADRs and describe them, as well as suspect drugs, in a tertiary care pediatric hospital in Mexico. Methods A total of 1,649 Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gómez ADR reports were analyzed. Completeness of the information was assessed, and ADRs severity and seriousness were assigned based on NOM-220-SSA1-2012, with causality being established according to the Naranjo algorithm. ADRs were classified with WHO Adverse Drug Reaction Terminology (WHO-ART). The drugs involved in ADRs were categorized according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification. Descriptive analysis was performed using the SPSS 20 statistical package. Results Of all the reports, 5.8% lacked sufficient information for the analysis (grade 0). ADRs frequency ranged from 2.12% to 8.07%. ADRs occurred most commonly in children (56.9%), in the female gender (52%), in subjects with normal BMI Z-score (46.6%) and malnutrition (35.3%), diagnosed with neoplasms (72.2%) and in the Emergency Department (70.0%). ADRs were severe in 14.4% of cases, in 81.0% they were serious and 2.1% were classified as definite. Most common serious ADR was febrile neutropenia (44.5%). The 0.7% of patients recovering with sequelae; 1.1% died (with the medication being associated) and 70.3% were admitted to the hospital as a result of an ADR. Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents were more commonly associated with serious ADRs. Conclusion ADRs affected morbidity and mortality, which is why strengthening pharmacovigilance programs in Mexican pediatric hospitals is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3012863657,"The maintenance and propagation of complex mixtures of cells in vitro in the form of native organs or engineered organoids has contributed to understanding mechanisms of cell and organ development and function which can be translated into therapeutic benefits. For example, allogeneic cultured postnatal human thymus tissue has been shown to support production of naïve recipient T cells when transplanted into patients with complete DiGeorge anomaly and other genetic defects that result in congenital lack of a thymus. Patients receiving such transplants typically exhibit reversal of their immunodeficiency and normalization of their peripheral blood T cell receptor V-beta repertoire, with long-term survival. This study was designed to assess the histopathologic changes that occur in postnatal human thymus slices when cultured according to protocols used for transplanted tissues. Results showed that as thymic organ cultures progressed from days 0 through 21, slices developed increasing amounts of necrosis, increasing condensation of thymic epithelium, and decreasing numbers of residual T cells. The architecture of the thymic epithelial network remained generally well-preserved throughout the 21 days of culture, with focal expression of cytokeratin 14, a putative biomarker of thymic epithelial cells with long-term organ-repopulating potential. All organ slices derived from the same donor thymus closely resembled one another, with minor differences in size, shape, and relative content of cortex versus medulla. Similarly, slices derived from different donors showed similar histopathologic characteristics when examined at the same culture time point. Taken together, these results demonstrate that diagnostic criteria based on structural features of the tissue identifiable via hematoxylin and eosin staining and cytokeratin immunohistochemistry can be used to evaluate the quality of slices transplanted into patients with congenital athymia."
https://openalex.org/W3012878901,"The awareness about software vulnerabilities is crucial to ensure effective cybersecurity practices, the development of high-quality software, and, ultimately, national security. This awareness can be better understood by studying the spread, structure and evolution of software vulnerability discussions across online communities. This work is the first to evaluate and contrast how discussions about software vulnerabilities spread on three social platforms-Twitter, GitHub, and Reddit. Moreover, we measure how user-level e.g., bot or not, and content-level characteristics e.g., vulnerability severity, post subjectivity, targeted operating systems as well as social network topology influence the rate of vulnerability discussion spread. To lay the groundwork, we present a novel fundamental framework for measuring information spread in multiple social platforms that identifies spread mechanisms and observables, units of information, and groups of measurements. We then contrast topologies for three social networks and analyze the effect of the network structure on the way discussions about vulnerabilities spread. We measure the scale and speed of the discussion spread to understand how far and how wide they go, how many users participate, and the duration of their spread. To demonstrate the awareness of more impactful vulnerabilities, a subset of our analysis focuses on vulnerabilities targeted during recent major cyber-attacks and those exploited by advanced persistent threat groups. One of our major findings is that most discussions start on GitHub not only before Twitter and Reddit, but even before a vulnerability is officially published. The severity of a vulnerability contributes to how much it spreads, especially on Twitter. Highly severe vulnerabilities have significantly deeper, broader and more viral discussion threads. When analyzing vulnerabilities in software products we found that different flavors of Linux received the highest discussion volume. We also observe that Twitter discussions started by humans have larger size, breadth, depth, adoption rate, lifetime, and structural virality compared to those started by bots. On Reddit, discussion threads of positive posts are larger, wider, and deeper than negative or neutral posts. We also found that all three networks have high modularity that encourages spread. However, the spread on GitHub is different from other networks, because GitHub is more dense, has stronger community structure and assortativity that enhances information diffusion. We anticipate the results of our analysis to not only increase the understanding of software vulnerability awareness but also inform the existing and new analytical frameworks for simulating information spread e.g., disinformation across multiple social environments online."
https://openalex.org/W3012597645,"The gene encoding eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (EIF5A) is found in diabetes-susceptibility loci in mouse and human. eIF5A is the only protein known to contain hypusine (hydroxyputrescine lysine), a polyamine-derived amino acid formed post-translationally in a reaction catalyzed by deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS). Previous studies showed pharmacologic blockade of DHPS in type 1 diabetic NOD mice and type 2 diabetic db/db mice improved glucose tolerance and preserved beta cell mass, which suggests that hypusinated eIF5A (eIF5AHyp) may play a role in diabetes pathogenesis by direct action on the beta cells and/or altering the adaptive or innate immune responses. To translate these findings to human, we examined tissue from individuals with and without type 1 and type 2 diabetes to determine the expression of eIF5AHyp. We detected eIF5AHyp in beta cells, exocrine cells and immune cells; however, there was also unexpected enrichment of eIF5AHyp in pancreatic polypeptide-expressing PP cells. Interestingly, the presence of eIF5AHyp co-expressing PP cells was not enhanced with disease.

For this study, 13 pairs of individuals engaged in a scripted word-by-word interaction, while we recorded the neural activity of both participants simultaneously using wireless EEG. To study expectation building, different semantic contexts were primed for each participant. Semantically unexpected continuations were introduced in 25% of all sentences. In line with the hypothesis, we observed amplitude differences for the P200—N400—P600 ERPs for unexpected compared to expected words. Moreover, we could successfully assess speech and reaction times. Our results show that it is possible to measure ERPs and RTs to semantically unexpected words in a dyadic interactive scenario."

The African mound building termite, Macrotermes bellicosus, is an important beneficial insect that functions as an ecosystem engineer due to its role in the breakdown of dead and decaying materials. Here, we examined the effects of 2,4-D amine salt (2,4-D) and atrazine based herbicides viz. Vestamine® and Ultrazine® on the survival and locomotion response of M. bellicosus. Worker termites were treated with a range of concentrations of Vestamine® (the recommended concentration: 6.25 ml per 500 ml of water, 0.25- and 0.5-fold below the recommended concentration and distilled water as control) and Ultrazine® (the recommended concentration: 3.75 ml per 500 ml of water, 0.25-, 0.5-, 2.0- and 4-fold of the recommended concentration and distilled water as control) for 24 hours for the mortality test, and allowed to run for 15 seconds for the locomotion trial. All concentrations of both Vestamine® and Ultrazine® were highly toxic to worker termites and mortality increased as the concentration and time after treatment increased. For both herbicides, concentrations far less than the recommended rates caused 100% mortality. The speed of termites was significantly influenced by both Vestamine® and Ultrazine® as termites exposed to all tested concentrations of the herbicides exhibited reduced running speed than the control. These findings suggest that beneficial insects, especially M. bellicosus may experience high mortality (up to 100%) and reduced mobility if they are sprayed upon or come in contact with plant materials that have been freshly sprayed with (less or more than) the recommended concentrations of Vestamine® and Ultrazine®. The findings of our study calls for the reassessment of the usage of 2,4-D and atrazine based herbicides in weed control in termite and other beneficial insect populated habitats."
https://openalex.org/W3012695406,"Definable habitats at the neighborhood level provide a wide range of favorable habitats with optimal conditions and environmental resources for mosquito survival. Problematic habitats for controlling mosquitoes in urban environments such as tire shops, bromeliad patches, and construction sites must be taken into consideration in the development of effective mosquito management and control in urban areas. Cemeteries are often located in highly urbanized areas serving as a haven for populations of vector mosquito species due to the availability of natural resources present in most cemeteries. Even though Miami-Dade County, Florida was the most affected area in the United States during the Zika virus outbreak in 2016 and is currently under a mosquito-borne illness alert after 14 confirmed locally transmitted dengue cases, the role of cemeteries in the proliferation of vector mosquitoes is unknown. Therefore, our objective was to use a cross-sectional experimental design to survey twelve cemeteries across Miami-Dade County to assess if vector mosquitoes in Miami can be found in these areas. Our results are indicating that vector mosquitoes are able to successfully exploit the resources available in the cemeteries. Culex quinquefasciatus was the most abundant species but it was neither as frequent nor present in its immature form as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. This study revealed that vector mosquitoes, such as Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and Cx. quinquefasciatus are successfully exploiting the resources available in these areas being able to thrive and reach high numbers. Mosquito control strategies should consider both long-term strategies, based on changing human behavior to reduce the availability of aquatic habitats for vector mosquitoes; as well as short-term strategies such as drilling holes or adding larvicide to the flower vases. Simple practices would greatly help improve the effectiveness of mosquito management and control in these problematic urban habitats."
https://openalex.org/W3012786978,"During the blood feeding, sand fly females inject saliva containing immunomodulatory and anti-haemostatic molecules into their vertebrate hosts. The saliva composition is species-specific, likely due to an adaptation to particular haemostatic pathways of their preferred host. Research on sand fly saliva is limited to the representatives of two best-studied genera, Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia. Although the members of the genus Sergentomyia are highly abundant in many areas in the Old World, their role in human disease transmission remains uncertain. Most Sergentomyia spp. preferentially attack various species of reptiles, but feeding on warm-blooded vertebrates, including humans and domestic animals, has been repeatedly described, especially for Sergentomyia schwetzi, of which salivary gland transcriptome and proteome is analyzed in the current study. Illumina RNA sequencing and de novo assembly of the reads and their annotation revealed 17,293 sequences homologous to other arthropods’ proteins. In the sialome, all proteins typical for sand fly saliva were identified–antigen 5-related, lufaxin, yellow-related, PpSP15-like, D7-related, ParSP25-like, and silk proteins, as well as less frequent salivary proteins included 71kDa-like, ParSP80-like, SP16-like, and ParSP17-like proteins. Salivary enzymes include apyrase, hyaluronidase, endonuclease, amylase, lipase A2, adenosine deaminase, pyrophosphatase, 5’nucleotidase, and ribonuclease. Proteomics analysis of salivary glands identified 631 proteins, 81 of which are likely secreted into the saliva. We also compared two S. schwetzi lineages derived from the same origin. These lineages were adapted for over 40 generations for blood feeding either on mice (S-M) or geckos (S-G), two vertebrate hosts with different haemostatic mechanisms. Altogether, 20 and 40 annotated salivary transcripts were up-regulated in the S-M and S-G lineage, respectively. Proteomic comparison revealed ten salivary proteins more abundant in the lineage S-M, whereas 66 salivary proteins were enriched in the lineage S-G. No difference between lineages was found for apyrase activity; contrarily the hyaluronidase activity was significantly higher in the lineage feeding on mice."
https://openalex.org/W3013926694,"During development of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Schwann-cell-secreted gliomedin induces the clustering of Na+ channels at the edges of each myelin segment to form nodes of Ranvier. Here we show that bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1)/Tolloid (TLD)-like proteinases confine Na+ channel clustering to these sites by negatively regulating the activity of gliomedin. Eliminating the Bmp1/TLD cleavage site in gliomedin or treating myelinating cultures with a Bmp1/TLD inhibitor results in the formation of numerous ectopic Na+ channel clusters along axons that are devoid of myelin segments. Furthermore, genetic deletion of Bmp1 and Tll1 genes in mice using a Schwann-cell-specific Cre causes ectopic clustering of nodal proteins, premature formation of heminodes around early ensheathing Schwann cells, and altered nerve conduction during development. Our results demonstrate that by inactivating gliomedin, Bmp1/TLD functions as an additional regulatory mechanism to ensure the correct spatial and temporal assembly of PNS nodes of Ranvier."
https://openalex.org/W3012631060,"Background Workplace bullying has diverse consequences at both the organisational and individual level. Anecdotal reports indicate that workplace bullying is an issue of particular concern for Australian FIFO workers, which may impact on psychosocial distress. However, no prior studies have examined this issue empirically in a FIFO worker cohort. Methods and materials A cross-sectional survey study design was used to establish the prevalence of bullying in Australian FIFO, antecedents of bullying, and its association with psychosocial distress. Responses were received from 580 FIFO workers in the Australian resources sector. Primary outcome measures were Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised, Beck Depression Inventory II, and Beck Hopelessness Scale. Logistic regression models were constructed to examine the association between bullying, suicide risk, and clinical depression. Results Over half of the respondents experienced workplace bullying (55.7%), and about one-third reported moderate or more severe depression (32.3%). Being above the median age (OR = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.31–0.83) and having a supervisor who failed to promote collaboration (OR = 3.04; 95% CI = 1.84–5.04) were both significantly associated with experiencing bullying. Bullying was associated with an almost threefold increase in the likelihood of participants reporting increased suicide risk (OR = 2.70; 95% CI = 1.53–4.76). Bullying was also associated with participants being almost two and a half times more likely to report clinical depression (OR = 2.38; 95% CI = 1.40–4.05). Conclusion The incidence of bullying in Australian FIFO workers has reached alarming proportions. Bullying was significantly associated with higher levels of clinical depression and suicide risk. The results highlight the need to implement in the Australian resource sector interventions that reduce workplace bullying."
https://openalex.org/W3012902709,"Background The objective of this retrospective survey was to evaluate after one year, the conditions and impacts of a dental sealant intervention conducted in New Caledonia, within a health promotion program. A greater or at least equivalent quality and impact of the intervention was expected for children living in socially deprived regions with the greatest health needs. Methods The study population was the schoolchildren, aged 6 years in 2016, who benefited from the dental sealant program (n = 2532). The study sample was randomly selected in 2017 from that population (n = 550). The children's dental status was evaluated at school in 2017 and compared with that recorded in 2016 during the sealant intervention allowing the calculation of the retention rates and one-year carious increment on first permanent molars. Socio-demographic variables (gender, public/private school) and conditions of sealant placement (school/dental office, presence of a dental assistant) were recorded. The carious increment was explained using a mixed multiple random-effects regression. A mediation analysis was conducted to assess the respective contributions of the retention rates and the region of origin on caries increment. Results The participation rate was very high (89%) and on average, children had 83% of their dental sealants present after one year, 31% fully and 52% partially present. Caries increment varied depending on the sealant retention rate as well as on the region (North, South, Islands). The mediation analysis showed that living in a deprived area (The Islands) was a strong determinant for high caries increment particularly when the retention rates were low. Conclusions This study showed a high participation rate and acceptable effectiveness as measured with the one-year retention rates, for a fissure sealant intervention conducted in real-life conditions and integrated in a large health promotion program. Nevertheless, the intervention was not effective enough to totally balance the influence of health determinants, especially in socially deprived sectors characterized by greater dental needs."
https://openalex.org/W3012947060,"Under paradigms of combined intravenous cocaine and ethanol self-administration, the effects on behavior have been poorly explored. Numerous studies have found sex differences in amino acids profile and behavioral responses to each drug, yet few have focused on the interactions between cocaine and ethanol. The main objective of this work was to explore the acquisition and maintenance of intravenous self-administration behavior with a combination of cocaine and ethanol in male and female young adult rats. Likewise, the amino acids profile in blood plasma was quantified 48 hours after the last self-administration session. Male and female 52 days old Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: i) saline control, ii) cocaine (1 mg/kg bodyweight/injection) and iii) cocaine and ethanol (1 mg + 133 mg/kg bodyweight/ injection). After 24 self-administration sessions carried out on a fixed-ratio-1 schedule, with a limit of 15 doses per session, 14 plasma amino acids were quantified by mean Capillary Electrophoresis technique. The curve of cocaine and ethanol combined self-administration was similar to that associated with cocaine administration alone, with females acquiring self-administration criterion before males. The self-administration of cocaine and ethanol altered the plasma concentration and relative ratios of the amino acid L-Tyrosine. In our intravenous self-administration model, females appeared more vulnerable to acquire abusive consumption of the cocaine and ethanol combination, which altered plasma L-Tyrosine levels."
https://openalex.org/W3012653563,"We consider the development and fitting of a dynamic model for desalinated water production by a direct-contact membrane distillation (DCMD) unit. Two types of dynamic-model structures, namely, lumped parameter and spatial, were evaluated. Both the models were validated using experimental response data generated by step testing the inlet hot stream temperature of a DCMD pilot plant. Both the model structures failed to follow the dynamic response adequately. However, a modification of the model by adding a heat loss term resulted in enhanced predictions for both model structures. The overall relative error in the model–plant mismatch was approximately 3%. This is reasonable considering the random uncertainties associated with the plant operation. This observation also improves our understanding of the importance of using better correlations for heat-transfer coefficients, to develop a more reliable and accurate predictive model for a wide range of operating conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3012824689,"Mast cells are connective tissue resident cells with morphological and functional characteristics that contribute to their role in allergic and inflammatory processes, host defense and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Mast cell activation results in the release of pro-inflammatory mediators which are largely responsible for the physiological functions of mast cells. The lectin ArtinM, extracted from Artocarpus heterophyllus (jackfruit), binds to D-manose, thus inducing degranulation of mast cells. ArtinM has several immunomodulatory properties including acceleration of wound healing, and induction of cytokine release. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of ArtinM in the activation and proliferation of mast cells. The rat mast cell line RBL-2H3 was used throughout this study. At a low concentration (0.25μg/mL), ArtinM induced mast cell activation and the release of IL-6 without stimulating the release of pre-formed or newly formed mediators. Additionally, when the cells were activated by ArtinM protein tyrosine phosphorylation was stimulated. The low concentration of ArtinM also activated the transcription factor NFkB, but not NFAT. ArtinM also affected the cell cycle and stimulated cell proliferation. Therefore, ArtinM may have therapeutic applications by modulating immune responses due to its ability to activate mast cells and promote the release of newly synthesized mediators. Additionally, ArtinM could have beneficial effects at low concentrations without degranulating mast cells and inducing allergic reactions."
https://openalex.org/W3012862046,"Accurate information of taxonomy and geographic range of seahorse species (genus Hippocampus) is the first step in preparing threat assessments and designing effective conservation measures. Here, we report first records and a range extension of the Japanese seahorse, Hippocampus mohnikei (Bleeker, 1853) from the Mandovi estuarine ecosystem of Goa, central west coast of India (CWCI) based on morphological and molecular analyses. The morphometric and meristic traits, particularly short snout (29–35% head length), double cheek spine, low coronet, long tail (51.2–57.9% of standard length), 11 trunk rings, 37–39 tail rings, 15–16 dorsal and 12–14 fin rays observed in four collected specimens matched with the reported key diagnostic morphological criteria of vouchered specimens of H. mohnikei. The seahorse mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cyt b) genes were partially sequenced for conclusive genetic identification of the species under study. Molecular analysis showed that all four individuals clustered together suggesting a monophyletic lineage. Using the maximum similarity with GenBank database, maximum likelihood network and subsequent morphological analysis, the identity of the collected seahorse species was reconfirmed as H. mohnikei. With this new report, the geographic range of H. mohnikei extended significantly to the west from its previously known range. This new sighting of H. mohnikei could indicate a long-distance dispersal facilitated by the prevailing oceanic circulation in the Indo-Pacific region or increased habitat suitability in bay-estuarine systems of Goa, CWCI. Comparison of the pair-wise genetic distances (Kimura 2-parameter) based on COI and Cyt b sequences revealed that the specimens examined in this study are genetically closer to H. mohnikei populations from Vietnam and Thailand than they are to those in Japan and China. To test the hypothesis whether H. mohnikei are vagrants or previously unreported established population, long-term inter-annual sampling and analyses are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3012919196,"Recent advances in optical neuroimaging systems as a functional interface enhance our understanding of neuronal activity in the brain. High density diffuse optical topography (HD-DOT) uses multi-distance overlapped channels to improve the spatial resolution of images comparable to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The topology of the source and detector (SD) array directly impacts the quality of the hemodynamic reconstruction in HD-DOT imaging modality. In this work, the effect of different SD configurations on the quality of cerebral hemodynamic recovery is investigated by presenting a simulation setup based on the analytical approach. Given that the SD arrangement determines the elements of the Jacobian matrix, we conclude that the more individual components in this matrix, the better the retrieval quality. The results demonstrate that the multi-distance multi-directional (MDMD) arrangement produces more unique elements in the Jacobian array. Consequently, the inverse problem can accurately retrieve the brain activity of diffuse optical topography data."
https://openalex.org/W3012627334,"Aim This study was conducted to investigate the effect of resuscitation guideline terminology on the performance of infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Methods A total of 40 intern or resident physicians conducted 2-min CPR with the two-finger technique (TFT) and two-thumb technique (TT) on a simulated infant cardiac arrest model with a 1-day interval. They were randomly assigned to Group A or B. The participants of Group A conducted CPR with the chest compression depth (CCD) target of “approximately 4 cm” and those of Group B conducted CPR with the CCD target of “at least one-third the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest”. Single rescuer CPR was performed with a 15:2 compression to ventilation ratio on the floor. Results In both chest compression techniques, the average CCD of Group B was significantly deeper than that of Group A (TFT: 41.0 [range, 39.3–42.0] mm vs. 36.5 [34.0–37.9] mm, P = 0.002; TT: 42.0 [42.0–43.0] mm vs. 37.0 [35.3–38.0] mm, P < 0.001). Adequacy of CCD also showed similar results (Group B vs. A; TFT: 99% [82–100%] vs. 29% [12–58%], P = 0.001; TT: 100% [100–100%] vs. 28% [8–53%], P < 0.001). Conclusions Using the CCD target of “at least one-third the anterior-posterior diameter of the chest” resulted in deep and adequate chest compressions during simulated infant CPR in contrast to the CCD target of “approximately 4 cm”. Therefore, changes in the terminology used in the guidelines should be considered to improve the quality of CPR.

https://openalex.org/W3012566936,"Background T-wave area dispersion (TW-Ad) is a novel electrocardiographic (ECG) repolarization marker associated with sudden cardiac death. However, limited data is available on the clinical correlates of TW-Ad. In addition, there are no previous studies on cardiovascular drug effects on TW-Ad. In this study, we examined the relation between TW-Ad and left ventricular mass. We also studied the effects of four commonly used antihypertensive drugs on TW-Ad. Methods A total of 242 moderately hypertensive males (age, 51±6 years; office systolic/diastolic blood pressure during placebo, 153±14/100±8 mmHg), participating in the GENRES study, were included. Left ventricular mass index was determined by transthoracic echocardiography. Antihypertensive four-week monotherapies (a diuretic, a beta-blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and an angiotensin receptor antagonist) were administered in a randomized rotational fashion. Four-week placebo periods preceded all monotherapies. The average value of measurements (over 1700 ECGs in total) from all available placebo periods served as a reference to which measurements during each drug period were compared. Results Lower, i.e. risk-associated TW-Ad values correlated with a higher left ventricular mass index (r = −0.14, p = 0.03). Bisoprolol, a beta-blocker, elicited a positive change in TW-Ad (p = 1.9×10−5), but the three other drugs had no significant effect on TW-Ad. Conclusions Our results show that TW-Ad is correlated with left ventricular mass and can be modified favorably by the use of bisoprolol, although demonstration of any effects on clinical endpoints requires long-term prospective studies. Altogether, our results suggest that TW-Ad is an ECG repolarization measure of left ventricular arrhythmogenic substrate."
https://openalex.org/W3012590550,"Urban stormwater is increasingly being considered a viable alternative water supply in California and throughout the southwestern U.S. However, current economic analyses of stormwater capture do not adequately examine differences in stormwater project types and do not evaluate co-benefits provided by the projects. As a result, urban stormwater capture is undervalued as a water supply option. To advance economic analyses of stormwater capture, we determined the levelized cost of water in U.S. dollar per acre-foot of water supply (AF; 1 AF = 1233.5 m3) for 50 proposed stormwater capture projects in California, characterizing the projects by water source, process, and water supply yield. In addition, we incorporated reported co-benefits of projects into the analysis to determine the net benefit of proposed projects. Proposed urban stormwater capture projects were more expensive than non-urban stormwater capture projects on a per-volume basis ($1,180 per AF and $531 per AF, respectively); however, this was primarily driven by the relatively large size of the non-urban stormwater capture projects examined. When incorporating the limited number of reported co-benefits of the projects, the expected levelized cost of water from urban stormwater capture projects decreased dramatically. For projects that reported even a limited number of additional benefits, the net levelized cost decreased from $1,030 per AF to $150 per AF, with some of the projects demonstrating a net benefit. Thus, scaling urban stormwater capture projects to capitalize on economies of scale and incorporating co-benefits of projects can dramatically improve the economic feasibility of these projects. This work demonstrates that stormwater capture can present a cost-effective water supply option in California, and that beyond California, fairer comparisons among projects and inclusion of co-benefits can provide decision makers with adequate information to maximize investments in water management."
https://openalex.org/W3012757271,"A longitudinal observational study was carried out to evaluate the influence of prenatal exposure to small ruminant lentivirus(SRLV)-infected does on the body weight (BWT) of young kids. The study was carried out in years 2001–2017 in the research dairy goat herd. Goats in the herd were regularly serologically tested and individuals showing clinical signs of caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE) were promptly culled. As a result all goats enrolled in the study were asymptomatic. Moreover, kids were weaned immediately after birth, fed on bovine colostrum and kept in strict separation from mothers to prevent SRLV lactogenic transmission. Kids were weighed immediately after birth, and then 1–3 times within the first 3 months of life. In total 620 goat kids were weighed at least once, excluding weighing at birth, providing 992 BWT records. The mixed linear model including four variables fitted as random effects (doe, kid, the year of kid’s birth and the exact age of a kid at weighing) and four potential confounders fitted as fixed effects (parity, kid’s sex, litter size and birth body weight) was developed and showed that BWT was not significantly associated with SRLV serological status of a doe, regardless of the time for which does had been infected before the delivery of the kid (p = 0.242). This study provides strong evidence that kids born to SRLV-infected does grow equally well as kids from uninfected does, provided that the lactogenic viral transmission is prevented by maintaining strict separation between the offspring and mothers. This observation is important for choosing the most optimal strategy of CAE control in a goat herd."
https://openalex.org/W3012786638,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a widely used treatment for patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (PCa). However, duration of treatment response varies, and most patients eventually experience disease progression despite treatment. Leuprorelin is a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, a commonly used form of ADT. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a biomarker for monitoring disease progression and predicting treatment response and survival in PCa. However, time-dependent profile of tumor regression and growth in patients with hormone-sensitive PCa on ADT has never been fully characterized. In this analysis, nationwide medical claims database provided by Humana from 2007 to 2011 was used to construct a population-based disease progression model for patients with hormone-sensitive PCa on leuprorelin. Data were analyzed by nonlinear mixed effects modeling utilizing Monte Carlo Parametric Expectation Maximization (MCPEM) method in NONMEM. Covariate selection was performed using a modified Wald’s approximation method with backward elimination (WAM-BE) proposed by our group. 1113 PSA observations from 264 subjects with malignant PCa were used for model development. PSA kinetics were well described by the final covariate model. Model parameters were well estimated, but large between-patient variability was observed. Hemoglobin significantly affected proportion of drug-resistant cells in the original tumor, while baseline PSA and antiandrogen use significantly affected treatment effect on drug-sensitive PCa cells (Ds). Population estimate of Ds was 3.78 x 10−2 day-1. Population estimates of growth rates for drug-sensitive (Gs) and drug-resistant PCa cells (GR) were 1.96 x 10−3 and 6.54 x 10−4 day-1, corresponding to a PSA doubling time of 354 and 1060 days, respectively. Proportion of the original PCa cells inherently resistant to treatment was estimated to be 1.94%. Application of population-based disease progression model to clinical data allowed characterization of tumor resistant patterns and growth/regression rates that enhances our understanding of how PCa responds to ADT."

https://openalex.org/W3012772201,"The novel finding of Balakrishnan, Miller & Shankar (2008) that investors, overwhelmed by the plethora of stock investment offerings, limit their analysis and daily choices to only a small subset of stocks (i.e., herding behavior) now seems to be common wisdom (Iosebashvili, 2019). We investigate whether the introduction of an innovation in financial products designed to allow investors to trade the entire product bundle of S&P 500 stocks, namely S&P 500 index funds, altered “herding behavior” by creating a new class of index investors. We model the distribution of daily trading concentration as a power law function and examine changes over the last six decades. Intriguingly, we discover a unique pattern in the trading concentration distribution that exhibits two distinct trends. For the period 1960–75, the trading concentration of the S&P 500 stocks tracks the increasing trend for the entire market, i.e., the unevenness in trading has steadily increased. However, after the introduction of S&P 500 index funds in 1975, concentration of trading in the S&P 500 stocks has steadily decreased, i.e., trading distribution has become more even across all 500 stocks, contrary to the current belief of equity analysts. This is also in sharp contrast to the case of U.S. stocks that are not in the S&P 500 index where trading concentration has steadily increased. We further corroborate the uniqueness of the inverted V-shape by a counterfactual investigation of the trading concentration patterns for other sets of 500 stock portfolios. This uniquely distinctive trading concentration pattern for S&P 500 stocks appears to be driven by the increasing dominance of bundle trading by index investors."
