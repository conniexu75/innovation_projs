https://openalex.org/W2065141250,"Detailed studies indicate a superconducting gap in the high-temperature superconductor Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)O(8). Photoemission measurements with high energy and angle resolution isolate the behavior of a single band as it crosses the Fermi level in both the normal and superconducting states, giving support to the Fermi liquid picture. The magnitude of the gap is 24 millielectron volts."
https://openalex.org/W2080083722,"Although most of the magnetic flux observed on the sun originates in the low-latitude sunspot belts, this flux is gradually dispersed over a much wider range of latitudes by supergranular convective motions and meridional circulation. Numerical simulations show how these transport processes interact over the 11-year sunspot cycle to produce a strong ""topknot"" polar field, whose existence near sunspot minimum is suggested by the observed strength of the interplanetary magnetic field and by the observed areal extent of polar coronal holes. The required rates of diffusion and flow are consistent with the decay rates of active regions and with the rotational properties of the large-scale solar magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W2039515235,"Stable isotope data from quartz veins in the Canadian Cordillera indicate that crustal fluids were heterogeneous in terms of sources and flow paths during Mesozoic-Cenozoic metamorphism and deformation. In regions of strike-slip and extensional faulting, the fluid regime to depths of at least 15 kilometers was dominated by convected, chemically evolved meteoric water. In contrast, in thrust faulted regions, the fluid regime was dominated by fluids derived from metamorphic devolatilization reactions. Deep convection of meteoric water implies that fluid pressures are hydrostatic in such systems not lithostatic, as had been commonly assumed. The occurrence of significantly lower fluid pressures would necessitate reevaluation of the manner in which metamorphic phase equilibria and stress relations in the crust are modeled. In addition, this study indicates that mesothermal gold deposits in the Canadian Cordillera are a product of the meteoric water convection process."
https://openalex.org/W2059979424,"An assessment of the effects of airline deregulation on travelers and carriers indicates that deregulation has provided travelers and carriers with $14.9 billion of annual benefits (1988 dollars). Airport congestion, airline safety, airline bankruptcy, and mergers are also analyzed and found in most cases to have reduced benefits. But, these costs should not be attributed to deregulation per se, but to failures by the government to pursue appropriate policies in these areas. Pursuit of policies that promote airline competition and efficient use of airport capacity would significantly increase the benefits from deregulation and would provide valuable guidance for other industries undergoing the transition to deregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2033828376,"Band 1 in the jet-cooled one-photon S(1) <-- S(0) fluorescence excitation spectrum of all-trans-1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene has been rotationally resolved with a molecular beam laser spectrometer. Both the orientation of the optical transition moment and the rotational constants of the two vibronic levels have been measured. The molecule shows no evidence of being significantly distorted from a C(24) geometry when it is low in the vibrational manifolds of either of the two electronic states."
