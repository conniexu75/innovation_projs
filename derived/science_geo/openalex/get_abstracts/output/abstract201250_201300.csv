https://openalex.org/W41162502,"The rapid appearance of radioactivity in the phosphoprotein fraction of tissues after exposure to inorganic radiophosphate was first noted by Davidson et al. (1). This finding was subsequently confirmed in several laboratories for a variety of cell types (2-5). The physiological function of phosphoproteins is obscure, however, since no direct evidence is yet available for their role in cell metabolism. Phosphoproteins such as casein can be phosphorylated by an enzyme present in mitochondria with adenosine triphosphate as the phosphate donor (6-9). A specific enzyme, phosphoprotein phosphatase, is capable of hydrolyzing the ester linkage. The phosphatase was originally found in frog eggs by Harris (lo), and it has been subsequently demonstrated in various tissues (11-13). We have recently reported on the properties of a phosphoprotein phosphatase occurring in the cytoplasmic particles of mouse liver (14). Construction of a hypothesis for the function of phosphoproteins in metabolism would be considerably aided by, and must be in agreement with, knowledge of the intracellular sites of the enzymes concerned in their metabolism. The observations reported here concern the intracellular location of the particulate phosphatase, and the existence of a second phosphoprotein phosphatase in the soluble phase of the cell. In addition, a particulate endogenous inhibitor of the soluble enzyme has been demonstrated."

These samples were analyzed for strontium and calcium by emission spectrographic teehniques. A retention factor between cows' milk and the feed used to produce this milk was determined to be 0.13 plus or minus 0.03. A human bone retention factor of 0.18 plus or minus 0.05 was determined by comparing the strontiumcalcium ratio observed for the human rib samples and the ratio estimated for the respective diets. The application of these values to the determination of the maximal radiostrontium level in human bone to be expected from the present level of fall-out contamination is discussed. (auth)"

J. Govaert2 was able to demonstrate that, in Fasciola hepatica, the acid not only persists but also remains quantitatively constant in the germinal vesicle. The same quantitative constancy was later found by J. Mulnard3 to be existing in the oocytes of Acanthoscelides obtectus."
