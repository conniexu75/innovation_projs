But how noisy are most genes? Taniguchi et al. (p. 533 ; see the Perspective by Tyagi ) now report single-cell global profiling of both messenger RNA (mRNA) and proteins in Escherichia coli using a yellow fluorescent protein fusion library. As well as a common extrinsic noise in high-abundance proteins, large fluctuations were observed in low-abundance proteins. Remarkably, in single-cell experiments, mRNA and protein levels for the same gene were uncorrelated."

Even though diverse organisms synthesize alkanes, synthesis pathways have remained elusive. Now Schirmer et al. (p. 559 ) describe an alkane biosynthesis pathway in cyanobacteria that converts intermediates of fatty acid metabolism to alkanes and alkenes. Heterologous expression of the biosynthetic genes resulted in production of alkanes in Escherichia coli . This pathway is likely to be a valuable tool in the production of biofuels."
https://openalex.org/W2028545985,"Background Chronic inflammation of the arterial wall is a key element in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, yet the factors that trigger and sustain the inflammation remain elusive. Inflammasomes are cytoplasmic caspase-1-activating protein complexes that promote maturation and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin(IL)-1β and IL-18. The most intensively studied inflammasome, NLRP3 inflammasome, is activated by diverse substances, including crystalline and particulate materials. As cholesterol crystals are abundant in atherosclerotic lesions, and IL-1β has been linked to atherogenesis, we explored the possibility that cholesterol crystals promote inflammation by activating the inflammasome pathway. Principal Findings Here we show that human macrophages avidly phagocytose cholesterol crystals and store the ingested cholesterol as cholesteryl esters. Importantly, cholesterol crystals induced dose-dependent secretion of mature IL-1β from human monocytes and macrophages. The cholesterol crystal-induced secretion of IL-1β was caspase-1-dependent, suggesting the involvement of an inflammasome-mediated pathway. Silencing of the NLRP3 receptor, the crucial component in NLRP3 inflammasome, completely abolished crystal-induced IL-1β secretion, thus identifying NLRP3 inflammasome as the cholesterol crystal-responsive element in macrophages. The crystals were shown to induce leakage of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B into the cytoplasm and inhibition of this enzyme reduced cholesterol crystal-induced IL-1β secretion, suggesting that NLRP3 inflammasome activation occurred via lysosomal destabilization. Conclusions The cholesterol crystal-induced inflammasome activation in macrophages may represent an important link between cholesterol metabolism and inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions."

These states have been imaged by photoemission, but little information on their transport parameters, for example, mobility, is available. We report the observation of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising from the surface states in nonmetallic crystals of Bi(2)Te(3). In addition, we uncovered a Hall anomaly in weak fields, which enables the surface current to be seen directly. Both experiments yield a surface mobility (9000 to 10,000 centimeter(2) per volt-second) that is substantially higher than in the bulk. The Fermi velocity of 4 x 10(5) meters per second obtained from these transport experiments agrees with angle-resolved photoemission experiments."

For this, oriented attachment of nanocrystal building blocks, a self assembly of particles into larger single crystalline objects, is one of the most promising approaches in nanotechnology. We report here the 2D oriented attachment of PbS nanocrystals into ultra-thin single crystal sheets with dimensions on the micrometer scale. We found that this process is initiated by co-solvents which alter nucleation and growth rates during the primary nanocrystal formation and finally driven by dense packing of oleic acid ligands on {100} facets of PbS. The obtained nanosheets can be readily integrated in a photo-detector device without further treatment."

A single, well-defined cell of origin could, in principle, lead to more effective targeted therapies. Based on histological evidence and/or studies of mouse tumors, luminal cells are believed to be the cell of origin in prostate cancer. Now, using functional assays of cells derived from benign human prostate tissue, Goldstein et al. (p. 568 ) find that a different cell type, basal cells, can give rise in mice to prostate tumors that closely resemble human prostate tumors. Thus, the cellular origin of prostate cancer may be more complex than anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W2048255799,"Salient stimuli redirect attention and suppress ongoing motor activity. This attentional shift is thought to rely upon thalamic signals to the striatum to shift cortically driven action selection, but the network mechanisms underlying this interaction are unclear. Using a brain slice preparation that preserved cortico- and thalamostriatal connectivity, it was found that activation of thalamostriatal axons in a way that mimicked the response to salient stimuli induced a burst of spikes in striatal cholinergic interneurons that was followed by a pause lasting more than half a second. This patterned interneuron activity triggered a transient, presynaptic suppression of cortical input to both major classes of principal medium spiny neuron (MSN) that gave way to a prolonged enhancement of postsynaptic responsiveness in striatopallidal MSNs controlling motor suppression. This differential regulation of the corticostriatal circuitry provides a neural substrate for attentional shifts and cessation of ongoing motor activity with the appearance of salient environmental stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1975255652,"The Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is critically required for the synaptic recruitment of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) during both development and plasticity. However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Using single-particle tracking of AMPARs, we show that CaMKII activation and postsynaptic translocation induce the synaptic trapping of AMPARs diffusing in the membrane. AMPAR immobilization requires both phosphorylation of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin and its binding to PDZ domain scaffolds. It does not depend on the PDZ binding domain of GluA1 AMPAR subunit nor its phosphorylation at Ser831. Finally, CaMKII-dependent AMPAR immobilization regulates short-term plasticity. Thus, NMDA-dependent Ca(2+) influx in the post-synapse triggers a CaMKII- and Stargazin-dependent decrease in AMPAR diffusional exchange at synapses that controls synaptic function."
https://openalex.org/W2062840905,"Form and Function The Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling pathway governs cell movements that drive axis elongation and neural tube closure in vertebrate embryos, and certain vertebrate PCP proteins have also been implicated in ciliogenesis. Likewise, the septin cytoskeleton controls diverse cell behaviors, such as cytokinesis and cell migration, but little is known about how septin functions are regulated in vivo. Kim et al. (p. 1337 , published online 29 July; see the Perspective by Barral ) found that control of septins by the PCP effector protein, Fritz, was a crucial control point for morphogenesis and ciliogenesis. During neural tube closure, Fritz-mediated septin localization maintained cell shape but not cell polarity. In ciliated epithelial cells, Fritz was required for assembly of the septin rings at the base of cilia, which are needed for normal ciliogenesis and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2148545198,"The mammalian brain exhibits profuse interregional connectivity. How information flow is rapidly and flexibly switched among connected areas remains poorly understood. Task-dependent changes in the power and interregion coherence of network oscillations suggest that such oscillations play a role in signal routing. We show that switching one of several convergent pathways from an asynchronous to an oscillatory state allows accurate selective transmission of population-coded information, which can be extracted even when other convergent pathways fire asynchronously at comparable rates. We further show that the band-pass filtering required to perform this information extraction can be implemented in a simple spiking network model with a single feed-forward interneuron layer. This constitutes a mechanism for flexible signal routing in neural circuits, which exploits sparsely synchronized network oscillations and temporal filtering by feed-forward inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2159928328,"Fanconi Anemia Protein in DNA Binding Fanconi anemia patients suffer a number of symptoms, including increased sensitivity to chemicals that cross-link DNA strands of the double helix together. Such aberrations can lead to genome instability. Mutations in 13 different genes implicated in repairing damaged DNA are known to be involved in the disease. Liu et al. (p. 693 , published online 29 July) have identified a new factor, FAN1 (Fanconi anemia–associated nuclease 1), which they find to be associated with a complex of two of the FANC proteins, FANCI and FANCD2 (the ID complex). The mono-ubiquitylated ID complex locates to sites of DNA damage to which it recruits FAN1, a mono-ubiquitin–binding protein. FAN1 has a DNA branch–specific nuclease activity that is required for the removal and subsequent repair of the interstrand DNA cross-links."
https://openalex.org/W2151810131,"It has recently been shown that some growth factors (GFs) have strong interactions with nonproteoglycan extracellular matrix proteins. Relevant here, the 12th-14th type three repeats of fibronectin (FN III12-14) have been shown to bind insulin-like growth factor binding-protein-3, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A with high affinity. Since FN III12-14 is known to bind GFs from different families, we hypothesized that this domain could be highly promiscuous in its GF-binding capacity. We used biochemical approaches and surface plasmon resonance to investigate such interactions with recombinant FN III12-14. We found that FN III12-14 binds most of the GFs from the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/VEGF and FGF families and some GFs from the transforming growth factor-β and neurotrophin families, with K(D) values in the nanomolar range, without inhibiting GF activity. Overall, 25 new binding interactions were identified. In a clinically relevant fibrin matrix, a fibrin-binding variant of FN III12-14 was highly effective as a GF delivery system. For instance, in matrices functionalized with FN III12-14, PDGF-BB-induced sprouting of human smooth muscle cell spheroids was greatly enhanced. We show that FN III12-14 is a highly promiscuous ligand for GFs and also holds great potential in clinical healing applications."
https://openalex.org/W2064759994,"In the long-range neuronal migration of adult mammals, young neurons travel from the subventricular zone to the olfactory bulb, a long journey (millimeters to centimeters, depending on the species). How can these neurons migrate through the dense meshwork of neuronal and glial processes of the adult brain parenchyma? Previous studies indicate that young neurons achieve this by migrating in chains through astrocytic tunnels. Here, we report that young migrating neurons actively control the formation and maintenance of their own migration route. New neurons secrete the diffusible protein Slit1, whose receptor, Robo, is expressed on astrocytes. We show that the Slit-Robo pathway is required for morphologic and organizational changes in astrocytes that result in the formation and maintenance of the astrocytic tunnels.

Astrocytes forming migration path of new neurons express Robo receptor New neurons use Slit1 to interact with astrocytes in their path for rapid migration New neurons actively regulate distribution and morphology of astrocytes in their path In the developing brain, immature neurons are produced in specific brain regions and migrate to their final destinations, where they assume their mature neuronal functions. Previous studies have established that this process is controlled by various extracellular signals in the neurons' surroundings that are mediated by transmembrane receptors expressed on the migrating neurons (Hatten, 2002Hatten M.E. New directions in neuronal migration.Science. 2002; 297: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, Marín and Rubenstein, 2003Marín O. Rubenstein J.L. Cell migration in the forebrain.Annu.

However, little is known about the role migrating neurons may play in the formation and maintenance of their own migration route. In the adult brain, new neurons are continuously generated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) at the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles, and they migrate into the olfactory bulb (OB), located at the anterior tip of the telencephalon. Throughout life, newly generated immature neurons migrate through the rostral migratory stream (RMS), the pathway leading to the OB (Doetsch and Alvarez-Buylla, 1996Doetsch F. Alvarez-Buylla A.

How can these neurons migrate through the dense meshwork of neuronal and glial processes of the adult brain parenchyma? During migration, the neurons in the RMS are unipolar or bipolar, with extended leading and trailing processes, and they form elongated cell aggregates called “chains,” within which they move over and past one another. The chains of neurons move inside tunnels formed by astrocytic processes, referred to as “glial tubes” (Jankovski and Sotelo, 1996Jankovski A. Sotelo C.

Some of these interactions are known. For example, the astrocytes in the RMS not only physically separate the chains of new neurons from the surrounding parenchyma, but also control neuronal migration by taking up GABA secreted from the migrating neurons (Bolteus and Bordey, 2004Bolteus A.J. Bordey A. GABA release and uptake regulate neuronal precursor migration in the postnatal subventricular zone.J.

However, little is known about how the tubular astrocytic structures are maintained or how their interactions with migrating neurons are regulated. The Slit proteins, large diffusible proteins whose receptors are the Robo transmembrane proteins, guide extending axons and migrating neurons in the CNS through chemorepulsion (Andrews et al., 2006Andrews W.

Directional guidance of neuronal migration in the olfactory system by the protein Slit.Nature. 1999; 400: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Slit1 is also expressed by the neurons migrating in the SVZ-RMS-OB pathway, and it appears to have a cell-autonomous role in their migration (Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al., 2004Nguyen-Ba-Charvet K.T. Picard-Riera N. Tessier-Lavigne M. Baron-Van Evercooren A. Sotelo C. Chédotal A. Multiple roles for slits in the control of cell migration in the rostral migratory stream.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We show here an unexpected mechanism that the new neurons use to support their long-distance directional migration in the adult brain. Our results reveal that the RMS astrocytes express Robo receptors and respond to the repulsive activity of the neuron-secreted Slit by forming and maintaining glial tubes. We first examined the morphology of the mouse SVZ-RMS-OB pathway in Hoechst-stained sagittal sections (Figures 1A and 1B ). In Slit1-deficient (S1−/−) mice, the anterior part of the SVZ and proximal part of the RMS were thickened, whereas the distal (rostral) part of the RMS was thinned. We quantified the number of proliferating and apoptotic cells throughout the RMS pathway by labeling cells for BrdU incorporation and cleaved caspase-3, respectively. There were no significant differences in these values between the WT and S1−/− brains (BrdU: WT, 4440 ± 374 cells versus S1−/−, 5296 ± 497 cells, p = 0.231; cleaved caspase-3: WT, 203 ± 44 cells versus S1−/−, 242 ± 27 cells, p = 0.434), suggesting that the loss of Slit1 did not affect the proliferation or survival of the cells in this region. However, the new neurons apparently accumulated in the anterior SVZ and proximal RMS of the S1−/− mice. To examine the migration defects of the new neurons in the S1−/− RMS, we compared their movement in S1−/− and WT brain slices in culture (Figures 1C–1E). To observe the migrating neurons, a DiI crystal was applied to the posterior part of the RMS in sagittal brain slices containing the SVZ-RMS-OB pathway. Time-lapse recordings of the DiI-labeled cells in the WT brain slices revealed that most neurons migrated rapidly along the RMS toward the OB, as previously reported (Murase and Horwitz, 2002Murase S. Horwitz A.F. Deleted in colorectal carcinoma and differentially expressed integrins mediate the directional migration of neural precursors in the rostral migratory stream.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3568-3579PubMed Google Scholar). However, in slices prepared from S1−/− mice, the migration of the DiI-labeled cells was significantly slower (40% reduction in speed) (Figures 1C–1E and Movie S1). To investigate the effects of the Slit1 mutation on neuronal migration in vivo, we stereotaxically injected a recombinant retrovirus encoding alkaline phosphatase (AP) into the anterior part of the SVZ and counted the number of labeled cells in the SVZ, RMS, and OB 3 days later (Figures 1F–1K). There was no significant difference in the total number of AP-labeled cells in the brains of the WT and S1−/− mice, indicating that Slit1 deficiency does not affect the infection or proliferation of the new neurons in the SVZ and RMS. However, the proportion of cells that reached the OB was significantly reduced in the S1−/− mice (Figure 1K). Together, these results clearly indicated that the migration of new neurons to the OB was disturbed in the S1−/− brain. To examine whether it is necessary for a new neuron to express Slit1 for its own migration, we compared the migratory behavior of WT and S1−/− new neurons labeled with different fluorescent dyes (red for WT and green for S1−/−) in the RMS of WT brain slices, by two-color time-lapse recording (Figure 2). S1−/− cells transplanted into the S1−/− RMS (Figures 2D and 2E, green) showed slower migration than WT cells transplanted into the WT RMS (Figures 2B and 2C, red), similar to the cells labeled with DiI in the WT and S1−/− brain slices (Figures 1C and 1D). S1−/− new neurons migrating in the WT RMS also showed significantly slower speeds compared with Slit1-expressing WT cells (Figures 2B, 2C, and 2F). Thus, for rapid migration, the new neurons appeared to require Slit1 in a cell-autonomous manner. We next examined whether Slit1-expressing WT cells could migrate normally in a Slit1-deficient RMS (Figures 2D and 2E) by transplanting mixed aggregates of WT and S1−/− cells into a S1−/− brain slice. The WT cells in the S1−/− RMS (Figures 2D and 2E, red) showed slower and more irregular migration than those in the WT RMS (Figures 2B and 2C, red), suggesting that the normal migration of new neurons also required Slit1 expression by the surrounding new neurons (Movie S2). We also tested whether the two dyes used in this experiment affected the new-neuron migration differently. WT cells were labeled with either the red or green fluorescent dye and transplanted into WT brain slices, but there were no significant differences in the migratory behaviors of the two groups of cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicated that Slit1 derived from both the new neurons themselves and the surrounding new neurons in the RMS is necessary to regulate the migration of new neurons to the OB. We next sought to identify the cells expressing Slit's receptors, the Robo proteins, in the RMS. To compare the pattern of Robo expression with that of Slit1, brain sections of heterozygous Slit1-GFP knockin (Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al., 2004Nguyen-Ba-Charvet K.T. Picard-Riera N. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Double immunostaining of Robo2 with cell-specific markers for new neurons (Dcx) and astrocytes (GFAP) showed that Robo2 was expressed strongly in the processes and soma of the astrocytes forming the glial tubes and weakly in the new neurons (Figures 3B and 3C). Furthermore, the astrocytic expression of Robo2 was observed almost exclusively in the SVZ-RMS-OB pathway and the corpus callosum overlying the SVZ and was undetectable in the hippocampus and neocortex (data not shown). Because it was difficult to distinguish the processes of new neurons from those of astrocytes in the RMS, where they were tightly associated, we confirmed the above expression pattern using dissociated SVZ cells plated on coverslips. We clearly observed Robo2 protein in the soma and processes of both astrocytes and new neurons (Figures 3F and 3G). Consistent with a previous report on the localization of Robo1 mRNA (Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al., 2004Nguyen-Ba-Charvet K.T. Picard-Riera N. Tessier-Lavigne M. Baron-Van Evercooren A. Sotelo C. Chédotal A. Multiple roles for slits in the control of cell migration in the rostral migratory stream.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we did not detect Robo1 protein in the SVZ or RMS (data not shown). Robo3 was detected in the new neurons and astrocytes in the RMS, but its expression was stronger in the mature neurons of the neocortex and striatum (Figures 3D and 3E). In summary, the ligand Slit1 was expressed in the migrating new neurons, whereas its receptors Robo2 and Robo3 were expressed in both the new neurons and astrocytes. These expression patterns suggest that Slit-Robo signaling is involved in the interaction between new neurons and their surrounding astrocytes in the RMS and is not simply a directional cue for migrating neurons. To investigate whether Slit-Robo signaling affects the cellular organization of the RMS, sagittal and coronal sections of S1−/− and WT mouse brains were immunostained with antibodies to GFAP and Dcx. Although new neurons accumulated in the S1−/− SVZ and RMS (Figure 1B), they still formed elongated chain-like aggregates, some of which were closely associated with adjacent blood vessels, much as in WT brains (Snapyan et al., 2009Snapyan M. Lemasson M. Brill M.S. Blais M. Massouh M. Ninkovic J. Gravel C. Berthod F. Götz M. Barker P.A. et al.Vasculature guides migrating neuronal precursors in the adult mammalian forebrain via brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 4172-4188Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) (Figures S1A and S1B). However, the distribution and directionality of the astrocytic processes were altered in the S1−/− RMS (Figures 4A–4D ). In the WT RMS, most of the astrocytic processes were oriented parallel to the chains of migrating new neurons. In contrast, irregular astrocytic processes were frequently observed running across the chains of new neurons in the S1−/− RMS. The proportion of the area inside the RMS occupied by GFAP+ processes in the S1−/− brains was more than twice that in the WT brains (Figure 4E). To corroborate and extend this observation at higher resolution, we used electron microscopy. As described previously (Doetsch et al., 1997Doetsch F. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A. Cellular composition and three-dimensional organization of the subventricular germinal zone in the adult mammalian brain.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5046-5061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Jankovski and Sotelo, 1996Jankovski A. Sotelo C.

Neurol. 1996; 371: 376-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the processes of astrocytes could be identified at the ultrastructural level by their light cytoplasm, which contained glycogen granules. They were readily distinguishable from the processes of new neurons in the RMS, which had a dark cytoplasm and contained many ribosomes (Figures 4F–4I). There was no significant difference in the percentage of astrocytic cell bodies among the identified cells in the RMS between the WT and S1−/− brains (Figure 4J). However, in the S1−/− RMS, astrocytic processes were observed within aggregates of new neurons. Such intermingling was rarely seen in the WT RMS (Figure 4K). The disorganization of glial tubes in the S1−/− RMS suggests that the Slit1 secreted by new neurons may facilitate their migration by actively preventing astrocytic processes from invading the migratory conduits within chains. The astrocytic expression of Robos (Figure 3) combined with the disorganization of the astrocytic tubes in Slit-deficient mice (Figure 4) strongly suggested that Slit can directly control the organization of astrocytes. To test this possibility, we performed an in vitro repulsion assay using a Slit-expressing HEK cell line (Wu et al., 1999Wu W. Wong K. Chen J. Jiang Z. Dupuis S. Wu J.Y. Rao Y. Directional guidance of neuronal migration in the olfactory system by the protein Slit.Nature. 1999; 400: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and primary cultured astrocytes dissociated from the SVZ and RMS. First, we examined the effect of Slit on the proliferation and survival of the astrocytes by culturing the astrocytes for 48 hr with conditioned medium from either Slit-expressing HEK cells or control, non-Slit-expressing HEK cells. The astrocytes were then double stained for GFAP and a mitotic cell marker, Ki67, or an apoptotic cell marker, cleaved caspase-3. There was no significant difference in the number of GFAP+ cells, i.e., astrocytes, or in the percentage of astrocytes expressing Ki67 or cleaved caspase-3 between the two culture conditions (data not shown), suggesting that Slit does not affect the proliferation or survival of SVZ/RMS astrocytes. We next tested the effects of Slit on the migration of these astrocytes. For this purpose, the astrocytes were cocultured on plastic plates with small pieces of collagen gel containing Slit-expressing HEK cells or control HEK cells (Figures 5A–5C ). After 4 days of culture, the distribution of astrocytes on the edges of the gel pieces was compared between the Slit and control groups. To quantify the GFAP+ cells, we measured the 500 μm wide strip just inside the edge of the gel piece and compared the GFAP+ area with the total area of the strip. Significantly fewer astrocytes lay on the Slit-containing gels than on the non-Slit-containing gels (Figures 5B–5D), suggesting that the astrocytes were repelled by Slit. To investigate whether this repulsive effect of Slit was mediated by the Robo receptors expressed on the astrocytes, we used a dominant-negative form of Robo1 (Robo DN), which lacks the intracellular domains required for signal transduction (Hammond et al., 2005Hammond R. Vivancos V. Naeem A. Chilton J. Mambetisaeva E. Mambitisaeva E. Andrews W. Sundaresan V. Guthrie S.

Neurosci. 2008; 11: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Figures 5E–5K). The Robo DN-transfected SVZ/RMS astrocytes showed no significant change in proliferation, apoptosis, or Slit-independent migration activity compared with control astrocytes transfected with a vector encoding GFP (Figures S2A–S2I). However, compared with the controls (Figures 5F, 5G, and 5J), the Robo DN-transfected astrocytes were considerably less affected by Slit (Figures 5H, 5I, and 5K). Moreover, Robo2 or Robo3 knockdown by an shRNA-encoding lentivirus also suppressed the repulsive activity of Slit (Figures S2J–S2R), suggesting that Robo2 and Robo3 mediated the repulsion of the astrocytes by Slit, at least in part. We further examined the possibility that neuronal Robos influences the arrangement of the astrocytes (Figures S2S–S2Z). To knock down the Robo2 and Robo3 specifically in new neurons, new neurons dissociated from a P0-2 mouse SVZ were infected with lentiviruses encoding either Robo2 shRNA, Robo3 shRNA, or a control sequence. The new neurons infected with each virus were then drop-cultured, mixed with astrocytes, and plated as aggregates on a laminin-coated dish. Twenty-four hours later, the new neurons had migrated out of the aggregates to a similar extent, regardless of the Robo knockdown or Slit1 knockout (data not shown). Subsequently, the astrocytes began to extend their processes along the WT migrating new neurons (Figures S2S and S2T). Notably, the migration of Slit1−/− new neurons associated with astrocytes was significantly disturbed (Figures S2U and S2V). Consistent with our in vivo observation (Figures 4A–4D), the normal arrangement of the astrocytic processes was markedly disrupted when they were cocultured with Slit1-deficient new neurons (Figures S2U and S2V), further confirming our conclusion that neuronal Slit1 is required for the astrocytic arrangement. On the other hand, we did not observe any such disturbance in astrocytes cocultured with new neurons infected with lentiviruses encoding Robo2 or Robo3 shRNA (Figures S2W–S2Z). Taken together, these results suggest that the neuron-derived repulsive factor Slit1 and its receptors that are expressed on astrocytes, rather than on neurons, directly control the organization of the glial tube. Finally, using new-neuron-astrocyte cocultures and time-lapse imaging, we studied the role of Slit-Robo signaling in the astrocytic control of neuronal migration and in the neuron-induced morphological changes in SVZ/RMS astrocytes. Aggregates of SVZ new neurons from WT or S1−/− mice were placed on plastic dishes with or without SVZ/RMS astrocytic feeder layers. On the dishes without astrocytes, there was no significant difference in the distance or speed of migration between S1−/− and WT new neurons (Figures 6A, 6B, 6E , S3A, S3D, and S3G). However, when S1−/− new neurons were plated on a monolayer of astrocytes, they migrated significantly more slowly than WT new neurons (Figures 6C, 6D, 6F, S3B, S3C, S3E, S3F, and S3H). This result suggested that Slit1′s promotion of neuronal migration depends on astrocytes. To test whether the Slit1-expressing neurons directly induced morphological changes in astrocytes, we observed the astrocytes making contact with new neurons, by z-stack time-lapse imaging of genetically labeled new neurons (Dcx-DsRed; Wang et al., 2007Wang X.

Our understanding of proteolytic processing of Htt has thus far focused on the protease families-caspases and calpains. Identifying critical proteases involved in Htt proteolysis and toxicity using an unbiased approach has not been reported. To accomplish this, we designed a high-throughput western blot-based screen to examine the generation of the smallest N-terminal polyglutamine-containing Htt fragment. We screened 514 siRNAs targeting the repertoire of human protease genes. This screen identified 11 proteases that, when inhibited, reduced Htt fragment accumulation. Three of these belonged to the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. One family member, MMP-10, directly cleaves Htt and prevents cell death when knocked down in striatal Hdh(111Q/111Q) cells. Correspondingly, MMPs are activated in HD mouse models, and loss of function of Drosophila homologs of MMPs suppresses Htt-induced neuronal dysfunction in vivo."

IntroductionCongenital hyperinsulinism is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants and children (1De León D.D. Stanley C.A. Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 3: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Six genetic loci have been associated with the disorder. The most common of these disorders are due to inactivating mutations of the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) 2The abbreviations used are: SUR1sulfonylurea receptor 1SCHADshort-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenaseGDHglutamate dehydrogenaseGSISglucose-stimulated insulin secretion[Ca2+]icytosolic calciumESembryonic stem cellAAMamino acid mixture. and Kir6.2 subunits of the β-cell ATP-dependent potassium (KATP) channel or to activating mutations of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and glucokinase. Recently, several children have been described with a recessively inherited form of hyperinsulinism that is associated with deficiency of a mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation enzyme, short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD) encoded by the HADH gene on 4q (2Hussain K.

Children afflicted with SCHAD deficiency have recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia that can be prevented by treatment with diazoxide (2Hussain K. Clayton P.T. Krywawych S. Chatziandreou I. Mills P.

Clayton P.T. Krywawych S. Chatziandreou I. Mills P. Ginbey D.W. Geboers A.J. Berger R. van den Berg I.E. Eaton S. J.

This form of abnormal insulin regulation is unique, because other genetic disorders of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation do not cause hyperinsulinism (5Stanley C.A. Bennett M.J. Mayatepek E. Disorders of Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Oxidation and Related Metabolic Pathyways. 4th Ed. Springer, Heidelberg2006Google Scholar). In addition, the genetic defect in SCHAD deficiency is expected to impair, rather than increase, the production of ATP, which normally serves as the triggering signal for insulin release. An important clue to the mechanism of insulin dysregulation in SCHAD deficiency has been recently provided by the report that affected children are sensitive to protein-induced hypoglycemia (6Kapoor R.R. James C. Flanagan S.E. Ellard S. Eaton S. Hussain K. J Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 94: 2221-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Elucidating the mechanism of insulin dysregulation and, especially, the cause of the hypersensitivity to protein-induced hypoglycemia in SCHAD deficiency may provide important insight into the regulation of insulin secretion in normal individuals. The present report describes studies of a mouse model of SCHAD deficiency that was developed by ablation of the mouse hadh gene. The results suggest that the dysregulation of insulin secretion associated with SCHAD deficiency is due to an activation of GDH enzyme activity, reflecting the loss of an inhibitory protein-protein interaction of SCHAD upon GDH, which has not previously been recognized.DISCUSSIONThese studies of mice with disruption of the SCHAD (hadh) gene demonstrate that they have a dysregulation of insulin secretion similar to the phenotype of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia reported in children with recessive inactivating mutations of HADH (also known as HAD1). In vivo, hadh−/− mice had reduced plasma glucose, increased plasma 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine, and increased urinary 3-hydroxyglutarate, consistent with observations in affected children. In vitro studies of isolated islets from hadh−/− mice showed increased sensitivity to amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion, indicating an activation of the glutaminolysis pathway through GDH to generate ATP and trigger release of insulin. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated binding of SCHAD to GDH, and enzyme kinetic studies in islet homogenates showed that absence of SCHAD increases the enzymatic efficiency of GDH. These findings indicate that hyperinsulinism in SCHAD-deficient mice is caused by loss of a “moonlighting” function of the SCHAD protein, which normally provides a direct inhibitory effect on GDH enzymatic activity in pancreatic β-cells (Fig. 7).A relationship between SCHAD deficiency and dysregulation of insulin secretion is clear in both humans and in mice. A total of five families has been reported with hyperinsulinism associated with SCHAD deficiency, and we are aware of three additional unpublished cases (2Hussain K. Clayton P.T. Krywawych S.

All of these cases had recessive mutations identified, and most appear to be associated with the absence of SCHAD protein, as well as enzymatic activity. It should be noted that other possible cases of SCHAD deficiency have been reported that did not have hyperinsulinism. In some, low SCHAD enzymatic activity was found in tissues, but none had mutations of the HADH1 gene (24Bennett M.J. Spotswood S.D. Ross K.F. Comfort S. Koonce R. Boriack R.L. IJlst L. Wanders R.J.

Neurol. 1991; 30: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). One reported case with partial enzyme deficiency was compound heterozygous for HADH1 missense mutations; in this case, the mutant protein was expressed in normal amounts, and the child did not appear to have hyperinsulinism (27Bennett M.J. Russell L.K. Tokunaga C. Narayan S.B. Tan L. Seegmiller A. Boriack R.L. Strauss A.W. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2006; 89: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Kapoor et al. recently described protein-sensitive hypoglycemia in three cases of SCHAD deficiency with hyperinsulinism (6Kapoor R.R. James C. Flanagan S.E. Ellard S. Eaton S. Hussain K. J Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 94: 2221-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This observation agrees with our finding of increased sensitivity to amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion in vivo and in isolated islets from hadh−/− mice (6Kapoor R.R. James C. Flanagan S.E. Ellard S. Eaton S. Hussain K. J Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 94: 2221-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Two of Kapoor's cases had mutations compatible with complete absence of SCHAD protein. The third case with protein-sensitive hyperinsulinism had a homozygous missense mutation with only a 50% reduction in enzyme activity and no abnormal fatty acid metabolites; it is possible that this amino acid change has little effect on enzymatic activity but interferes with the effect of the protein on GDH regulation.SCHAD deficiency also appears to play a role in the hyperinsulinism associated with islet-specific knock-out of the FOXa2 transcription factor (28Sund N.J. Vatamaniuk M.Z. Casey M. Ang S.L. Magnuson M.A. Stoffers D.A. Matschinsky F.M. Kaestner K.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1706-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Islets from these mice have reduced expression of both SCHAD and Kir6.2, one of the genes associated with the KATP channel form of hyperinsulinism. This combined deficiency causes a more severe hypoglycemic phenotype than deficiency of KATP alone, consistent with SCHAD deficiency having an independent role in causing hyperinsulinism. Attempts to identify the mechanism of hyperinsulinism in SCHAD deficiency using RNA interference to suppress enzyme expression have yielded inconsistent results. Our colleagues, Hardy et al., found increases in basal, but not in glucose-stimulated insulin release when hadh was suppressed by RNA interference in INS 832/13 cells and in isolated mouse islets (29Hardy O.T. Hohmeier H.E. Becker T.C. Manduchi E. Doliba N.M. Gupta R.K. White P. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Matschinsky F.M. Newgard C.B. Kaestner K.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); the increased insulin release was not inhibited by diazoxide in the cells that were knocked down, suggesting a KATP-channel-independent mechanism. In contrast, Pipeleers and colleagues (22Martens G.A. Vervoort A. Van de Casteele M. Stangé G. Hellemans K. Van Thi H.V. Schuit F. Pipeleers D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21134-21144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that knock-down of hadh did not affect basal secretion, but increased insulin responses to GSIS and to depolarization with KCl in both INS cells and in rat islet cells; they suggested that an amplifying effect on GSIS of fatty acyl-CoAs proximal to the SCHAD step was responsible for hyperinsulinism in SCHAD deficiency. In contrast to both of these reports, the present findings in the SCHAD knock-out mouse did not show changes in GSIS, and neither of these knock-down studies addressed the protein sensitivity in SCHAD deficiency, which has recently been recognized to be an important feature of the disorder in children (6Kapoor R.R.

The reasons for the different findings in the two studies with SCHAD knockdown are not clear, but an important factor may be the fact that both achieved only a partial, 50–80% reduction of SCHAD. Based on the reported cases of SCHAD deficiency associated with hyperinsulinism, this is likely insufficient to reproduce the hyperinsulinism phenotype. In a child with missense SCHAD mutations that reduced enzyme activity to 10–20% of normal (similar to the residual SCHAD expression reported in the knock-down experiments), there was no evidence of hyperinsulinism (27Bennett M.J.

Metab. 2006; 89: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).The present experiments suggest that the mechanism of insulin dysregulation associated with SCHAD deficiency is similar to that seen in children with activating mutations of GDH (30Stanley C.A.

These mutations impair allosteric inhibition of GDH by GTP, thus leading to increased oxidation of glutamate and insulin release. Affected patients have increased sensitivity to activation of GDH by leucine, which is manifested clinically by hypoglycemia in response to ingestion of protein meals (32Hsu B.Y. Kelly A.

Koo-McCoy S. Thornton P.S. Stanley C.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 3724-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These patients also have persistent hyperammonemia, possibly due to the activation of GDH enzyme activity in the liver or kidney (34Treberg J.R. Brosnan M.E. Watford M. Brosnan J.T. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2010; 50: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Hyperammonemia is not a feature of SCHAD deficiency, perhaps because the activation of GDH may be limited to islets and also appears to be less severe than in GDH activating mutations.Isolated hadh−/− islets demonstrate many similarities to those of islets expressing the H454Y-activating mutation of GDH. Islets from both mouse models release insulin in response to a physiological mixture of amino acids. Both show increased basal rates of glutaminolysis and a reduced threshold for leucine stimulation of insulin release, although the threshold in hadh−/− islets is intermediate between control and GDH transgenic islets (12Li C. Matter A. Kelly A. Petty T.J. Najafi H. MacMullen C. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Lazarow A. Kwagh J. Collins H.W. Hsu B.Y. Nissim I. Yudkoff M. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15064-15072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Unlike GDH transgenic islets, hadh−/− islets failed to release insulin in response to glutamine alone, but required the presence of leucine at concentrations that are not stimulatory in control islets. For maximum insulin response, islets from hadh−/− mice required exposure to alanine, glutamine, and leucine. The effect of alanine addition may be attributed to its contribution via acetyl-CoA formation to stimulate ATP production from the oxidation of glutamate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (20Li C. Nissim I. Chen P. Buettger C. Najafi H. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Stanley C.A. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17238-17249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 7). These observations suggest that the degree of activation of GDH in hadh−/− is lower than in islets expressing the activating H454Y GDH; this may account for the somewhat milder hypoglycemia of hadh−/− mice compared with the GDH transgenic mouse.We did not observe any abnormalities in the responses of islets from SCHAD-deficient mice to the addition of fatty acids, including medium-chain fatty acids, which are substrates for the action of SCHAD. Octanoate potentiated the effect of amino acids on the stimulation of insulin secretion in hadh−/− islets, but this was not different from its effect on GSIS in both control and −/− islets. The failure to observe a specific effect of fatty acids on insulin secretion in hadh−/− islets indicates that the hyperinsulinism is not the result of accumulation of fatty acid intermediates. It is also consistent with the fact that other genetic defects of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation do not cause hyperinsulinism (5Stanley C.A. Bennett M.J. Mayatepek E. Disorders of Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Oxidation and Related Metabolic Pathyways. 4th Ed. Springer, Heidelberg2006Google Scholar).Measurements of cytosolic calcium responses to stimuli confirmed that the hyper-responsiveness of hadh−/− islets was specific to amino acid stimulation. Basal calcium concentrations and basal insulin secretion were normal in hadh−/− islets. This contrasts with islets from SUR1−/− mice, which serve as a model for the recessive form of hyperinsulinism due to inactivating mutations of the β-cell KATP channel. SUR1−/− islets lacking KATP channel activity are constitutively depolarized and have elevated basal concentrations of cytosolic calcium (7Li C. Buettger C. Kwagh J. Matter A. Daikhin Y. Nissim I.B.

In addition, patients with KATP channel inactivation are unresponsive to treatment with diazoxide, a KATP channel agonist, whereas patients with SCHAD deficiency respond well to diazoxide (2Hussain K.

J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, the hyperinsulinism associated with SCHAD deficiency is not due to abnormalities of the KATP channel. Cytosolic calcium responses to glucose stimulation showed subtle differences in hadh−/− islets (Fig. 5), which probably reflect increased metabolism of intracellular amino acids via GDH in the basal state (see also Table 2).Our findings suggest that GDH activation in SCHAD deficiency is due to the loss of a direct protein-protein interaction between the two enzymes. This was demonstrated by both immunoprecipitation and protein pull-down experiments, confirming and extending observations recently reported by Filling et al. (21Filling C. Keller B. Hirschberg D. Marschall H.U. Jörnvall H. Bennett M.J. Oppermann U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 368: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). That SCHAD may have a regulatory effect on GDH via this protein-protein interaction could not have previously been anticipated. As noted above, with the possible exception of one of the cases described by Kapoor (6Kapoor R.R. James C. Flanagan S.E. Ellard S. Eaton S. Hussain K. J Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 94: 2221-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it appears that cases of SCHAD deficiency without hyperinsulinism express normal amounts of enzyme protein, whereas cases associated with hyperinsulinism lack SCHAD protein (including an unpublished case we have recently identified). This phenomenon, in which a protein has additional functions in other pathways, has been termed moonlighting protein effects (35Jeffery C.J. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2005; 24: 772-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As in the present experiments, mass spectrometry has been useful in detecting such interactions (35Jeffery C.J. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2005; 24: 772-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The pulldown experiments identified additional proteins that complex with SCHAD and GDH, including enzymes related to ureagenesis and ketogenesis, which might form a larger regulatory network. For example, although not detected in our SCHAD pulldown assays, SIRT4, one of the sirtuin enzymes involved in calorie-restriction longevity, has been reported to associate with GDH and inhibit its activity by ADP ribosylation (36Haigis M.C. Mostoslavsky R. Haigis K.M. Fahie K. Christodoulou D.C. Murphy A.J. Valenzuela D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Karow M. Blander G. Wolberger C. Prolla T.A. Weindruch R. Alt F.W. Guarente L. Cell. 2006; 126: 941-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar).Our experiments indicate that SCHAD reduces the affinity of GDH for α-ketoglutarate, but for not ammonia, suggesting that the presence of SCHAD affects binding of the carboxyl end of the substrate in the catalytic site. The effect was limited to islet GDH, perhaps reflecting the high levels of SCHAD (22Martens G.A. Vervoort A. Van de Casteele M. Stangé G. Hellemans K. Van Thi H.V. Schuit F. Pipeleers D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21134-21144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and, especially, the high ratio of SCHAD to GDH in this tissue (Table 3). It is interesting to speculate that the inhibitory effect of SCHAD on GDH might be part of a mechanism for reciprocal control of fatty acid and amino acid oxidation. Further work is clearly needed to define the details of how SCHAD modifies GDH activity, especially in islets.In summary, the results of our studies of insulin dysregulation in hadh−/− mice provide an explanation for the hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia reported in children with SCHAD deficiency. These mice display amino acid sensitive hypoglycemia in vivo. Their islets have abnormal sensitivity to amino acid stimulation of insulin secretion and demonstrate evidence of increased GDH activity, similar to islets expressing activating mutations of GDH. The activation of GDH appears to be related to a loss of a regulatory protein-protein interaction between GDH and SCHAD. IntroductionCongenital hyperinsulinism is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants and children (1De León D.D. Stanley C.A. Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 3: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Six genetic loci have been associated with the disorder. The most common of these disorders are due to inactivating mutations of the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) 2The abbreviations used are: SUR1sulfonylurea receptor 1SCHADshort-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenaseGDHglutamate dehydrogenaseGSISglucose-stimulated insulin secretion[Ca2+]icytosolic calciumESembryonic stem cellAAMamino acid mixture. and Kir6.2 subunits of the β-cell ATP-dependent potassium (KATP) channel or to activating mutations of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and glucokinase. Recently, several children have been described with a recessively inherited form of hyperinsulinism that is associated with deficiency of a mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation enzyme, short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD) encoded by the HADH gene on 4q (2Hussain K.

Children afflicted with SCHAD deficiency have recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia that can be prevented by treatment with diazoxide (2Hussain K. Clayton P.T. Krywawych S. Chatziandreou I. Mills P.

This form of abnormal insulin regulation is unique, because other genetic disorders of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation do not cause hyperinsulinism (5Stanley C.A. Bennett M.J. Mayatepek E. Disorders of Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Oxidation and Related Metabolic Pathyways. 4th Ed. Springer, Heidelberg2006Google Scholar). In addition, the genetic defect in SCHAD deficiency is expected to impair, rather than increase, the production of ATP, which normally serves as the triggering signal for insulin release. An important clue to the mechanism of insulin dysregulation in SCHAD deficiency has been recently provided by the report that affected children are sensitive to protein-induced hypoglycemia (6Kapoor R.R. James C. Flanagan S.E. Ellard S. Eaton S. Hussain K. J Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 94: 2221-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Elucidating the mechanism of insulin dysregulation and, especially, the cause of the hypersensitivity to protein-induced hypoglycemia in SCHAD deficiency may provide important insight into the regulation of insulin secretion in normal individuals. The present report describes studies of a mouse model of SCHAD deficiency that was developed by ablation of the mouse hadh gene. The results suggest that the dysregulation of insulin secretion associated with SCHAD deficiency is due to an activation of GDH enzyme activity, reflecting the loss of an inhibitory protein-protein interaction of SCHAD upon GDH, which has not previously been recognized. Congenital hyperinsulinism is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants and children (1De León D.D. Stanley C.A. Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol.

https://openalex.org/W2043363450,"PTIP in Immunoglobulin Switching One of the hallmarks of humoral immunity is the ability of immunoglobulins (Ig) to undergo class switch recombination (CSR). Through genetic recombining of the Ig heavy chain, Igs maintain their antigen specificity but gain the ability to interact with different cell surface receptors required for successful pathogen clearance. CSR requires transcription at the Ig heavy chain locus to initiate genetic rearrangement. Changes in chromatin accessibility are thought to promote CSR-associated transcription. Daniel et al. (p. 917 , published online 29 July; see the Perspective by Singh and Demarco ) now show that trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) controls the accessibility of the Ig heavy chain locus to CSR and that PTIP (Pax interaction with transcription-activation domain protein-1), a component of the histone methylase complex, is required for this modification. Mouse PTIP-deficient B cells exhibited impaired CSR. PTIP was required both for the recruitment RNA Polymerase II and for subsequent chromatin remodeling, including histone acetylation, which occurs during CSR. Largely independent of its function in transcription initiation in CSR, PTIP also associated with double-stranded DNA breaks during CSR and promoted genome stability. These dual functions of PTIP may be important for the precise coordination of chromatin accessibility and recombination required during CSR."

Btbd7 is induced by a matrix protein at sites of cleft progression and induces a transcription factor and suppresses cell adhesion. The resulting local cell separation and motility contribute to transient tissue gaps that contribute to clefts that help form branched organs."
https://openalex.org/W2028533061,"The mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) has emerged as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signaling hub that accommodates ER chaperones, including the lectin calnexin. At the MAM, these chaperones control ER homeostasis but also play a role in the onset of ER stress-mediated apoptosis, likely through the modulation of ER calcium signaling. These opposing roles of MAM-localized chaperones suggest the existence of mechanisms that regulate the composition and the properties of ER membrane domains. Our results now show that the GTPase Rab32 localizes to the ER and mitochondria, and we identify this protein as a regulator of MAM properties. Consistent with such a role, Rab32 modulates ER calcium handling and disrupts the specific enrichment of calnexin on the MAM, while not affecting the ER distribution of protein-disulfide isomerase and mitofusin-2. Furthermore, Rab32 determines the targeting of PKA to mitochondrial and ER membranes and through its overexpression or inactivation increases the phosphorylation of Bad and of Drp1. Through a combination of its functions as a PKA-anchoring protein and a regulator of MAM properties, the activity and expression level of Rab32 determine the speed of apoptosis onset."
https://openalex.org/W1966599320,"Modulation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels controls activities of excitable cells. We show that high-voltage activated Ca2+ channels are regulated by membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) with different sensitivities. Plasma membrane PIP2 depletion by rapamycin-induced translocation of an inositol lipid 5-phosphatase or by a voltage-sensitive 5-phosphatase (VSP) suppresses CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channel currents by ∼35% and CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 currents by 29% and 55%, respectively. Other CaV channels are less sensitive. Inhibition is not relieved by strong depolarizing prepulses. It changes the voltage dependence of channel gating little. Recovery of currents from inhibition needs intracellular hydrolysable ATP, presumably for PIP2 resynthesis. When PIP2 is increased by overexpressing PIP 5-kinase, activation and inactivation of CaV2.2 current slow and voltage-dependent gating shifts to slightly higher voltages. Thus, endogenous membrane PIP2 supports high-voltage activated L-, N-, and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, and stimuli that activate phospholipase C deplete PIP2 and reduce those Ca2+ channel currents."

However, the NS ORF is more similar in length to the NS ORF found in canine minute virus and bovine parvovirus than in HBoV. Comparative genetic analysis using GBoV and HBoV genomes enabled characterization of unique splice donor and acceptor sites that appear to be highly conserved among all four HBoV species, and provided evidence for expression of two different NS proteins in all primate bocaviruses.

On the other hand, cross-modal interactions in auditory fields have been often reported either in anesthetized or awake animals and the common finding is that weak responses are evoked by somatosensory and visual stimuli alone, whereas the auditory evoked-responses are influenced when delivered simultaneously with somatosensory or visual stimuli (Bizley et al., 2007Bizley J.K.

Again, although these responses suggest that multimodal integration occurs in early sensory cortices, its functional meaning in perceptual judgments is unclear, because in many of these studies the subjects were not evaluating the stimuli and reacting accordingly, but rather perceived them passively. We addressed these problems by recording from single neurons in S1 (areas 3b, 1 and 2), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and primary auditory cortex (A1) while trained monkeys discriminated the difference in rate of two flutter stimuli. On randomly interleaved trials, the subjects discriminated either two tactile flutter stimuli (range of 4–40 Hz; Hernández et al., 1997Hernández A. Salinas E. García R. Romo R.

In both tactile and acoustic flutter discrimination tasks, monkeys report whether the second stimulus rate (f2) is higher or lower than the first stimulus rate (f1). This cognitive operation requires that subjects compare information of f2 with a stored trace of f1 to form a decision, i.e., whether f2 > f1 or f2 < f1, and to report their perceptual sensory evaluation after a short, fixed delay period. The first objective of this experiment was to determine whether S1 and S2 neurons encode not only tactile flutter, as shown before (de Lafuente and Romo, 2005de Lafuente V. Romo R.

Periodicity and firing rate as candidate neural codes for the frequency of vibrotactile stimuli.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5503-5515PubMed Google Scholar), but also acoustic flutter. By encoding we mean that a neuron's response (either its firing rate or periodicity) varies significantly as a function of flutter rate (Hernández et al., 2000Hernández A. Zainos A. Romo R.

Periodicity and firing rate as candidate neural codes for the frequency of vibrotactile stimuli.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5503-5515PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, we sought to determine whether A1 neurons encode not only acoustic flutter (Lemus et al., 2009aLemus L. Hernández A. Romo R. Neural codes for perceptual discrimination of acoustic flutter in the primate auditory cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 9471-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but tactile flutter as well. We investigated this during the stimulus presentation periods and during the delay or working memory period of the tasks. In these tasks, we also sought to determine whether the neuronal activities that encoded the principal or another sensory modality, predicted the animal's motor choice. Our second objective, in a cross-modal variant of these tasks, was to test whether S1, S2 and A1 neurons showed cross-modal processing. In interleaved trials, animals discriminated pairs of flutter stimuli in which f1 was acoustic and f2 was tactile, and vice versa. Our third objective, in another variant of the flutter tasks, was to explore whether the processing of the principal sensory modality was influenced or modulated by an additional sensory modality. In this task condition, animals discriminated between f1 and f2 tactile flutter and acoustic flutter delivered synchronously. We found neurons in S1, S2 and A1 that can respond to stimuli that are not of their principal sensory modality during these tasks. However, the identity of the stimuli could only be decoded from responses to their principal sensory modality during the stimulus periods. We also found, except for a few S2 neurons, that none of the neurons in S1 and A1 encoded information about either tactile or acoustic stimuli during the working memory component of these tasks. Few S2 neurons predicted in their activities the motor choice during either tactile flutter discrimination or acoustic flutter discrimination. Finally, we did not find cross-modal interactions or enhanced/suppressed responses by a second, congruent stimulus, neither during the stimulation periods nor during the cognitive components of the tasks used here. We think that these results are important for understanding the functional organization of sensory cortices in multimodal processing and perceptual judgments. Two monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were first trained to discriminate, on randomly interleaved trials, either two tactile flutter stimuli or two acoustic flutter stimuli (Figures 1A–1C ) until their discrimination thresholds were stable (Figure 1D). They were then trained to discriminate pairs of flutter stimuli, on interleaved trials, in which f1 was tactile and f2 acoustic, and vice versa (Figures 1E–1H). Animals also discriminated the frequencies of simultaneously delivered synchronous tactile and acoustic stimuli (Figures 1I–1K). In all these sets, trials can be divided into two types: those in which f2 > f1 and those in which f2 < f1. All neurons were recorded using stimulus sets B, C, F, G and J of Figure 1. Because of the task designs, the neuronal responses across trials can be analyzed as functions of f1, f2, f2 – f1, or as functions of the monkeys' two possible motor choices. We recorded from 74 single neurons in area 3b while monkeys discriminated, on interleaved trials, either two tactile flutter stimuli or two acoustic flutter stimuli (Figure 1A; Table 1). All these neurons had cutaneous receptive fields confined to the distal segment of one fingertip. We considered a neuron's response as task-related if during any of the relevant periods (f1, delay between f1 and f2, f2, and delay between the end of f2 and pu) its mean firing rate was significantly different from a control period preceding the beginning of probe indentation of each trial (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test [Siegel and Castellan, 1988Siegel S. Castellan N.J. Nonparametric Statistics for Behavioral Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1988Google Scholar]). We then measured the mean firing rate and periodicity for each task-related neuron's response during any of the relevant periods (Hernández et al., 2000Hernández A. Zainos A. Romo R.

Typical responses of an example area 3b neuron during either the tactile or the acoustic flutter discrimination are illustrated in Figures 2A and 2B . The neuron shows a brief response to the initial probe indentation (pd) at the beginning of each trial, during the tactile flutter stimuli (Figure 1A) and at the removal of the probe from the skin (pu), a typical rapidly adapting response. The mean firing rate of this neuron increased monotonically as a function of the tactile flutter frequency (first and third panels of Figure 2C) but not as a function of the acoustic flutter frequency (first and third panels of Figure 2D). In addition, the firing rate was not modulated during the working memory or postponed-decision periods for either the tactile flutter discrimination task (second and fourth panels of Figure 2C) or the acoustic flutter discrimination task (second and fourth panels of Figure 2D). We also measured whether this neuron represented the periodicity of the tactile or the acoustic flutter stimuli, and found that periodicity changes systematically only as a function of the tactile flutter stimulus and only during the presentation of f1 (first panel of Figure 2C).Table 1Database of S1 (Areas 3b, 1, and 2), S2, and A1Tactile FlutterAuditory Flutterf1Delay f1-f2f2Delay f2-puf1Delay f1-f2f2Delay f2-puArea 3bResponsive74(100%)5(7%)74(100%)–13(18%)–1(1%)–n = 74Periodicity50(68%)–39(53%)–––––Firing rate48(65%)–45(61%)–––––Area 1Responsive132(100%)16(12%)132(100%)25(19%)17(13%)4(3%)37(28%)20(15%)n = 132Periodicity42(32%)–36(27%)–––––Firing rate47(36%)2(1%)44(33%)2(1%)––––Area 2Responsive122(69%)34(19%)87(49%)26(15%)24(14%)13(7%)18(10%)12(7%)n = 176Periodicity29(16%)–31(18%)–––––Firing rate49(28%)4(2%)70(40%)3(2%)––2(1%)1(1%)S2Responsive88(68%)18(14%)80(62%)36(28%)14(11%)9(7%)35(27%)27(21%)n = 129Periodicity10(8%)–8(6%)–––––Firing rate45(35%)14(11%)64(50%)40(31%)1(1%)3(2%)14(11%)25(19%)A1Responsive8(11%)–1(1%)–49(69%)15(21%)48(68%)13(18%)n = 71Periodicity––––7(10%)–6(8%)–Firing rate––––31(44%)–39(55%)– Open table in a new tab We also quantified the different possible encoding schemes in area 3b, by modeling the firing rate and periodicity values during the tactile and acoustic tasks as arbitrary linear functions of both f1 and f2, such that for each neuron: firing rate (t) = a1(t)f1 + a2(t)f2 + a3(t) (Draper and Smith, 1966Draper N.

In this formulation, t represents time, and the coefficients a1 and a2 serve as direct measurements of the dependence on f1 and f2, respectively. These measures were calculated in sliding windows of 200 ms moving in steps of 50 ms. To illustrate this analysis, the resulting coefficients a1 and a2 for the neuron of Figure 2 are plotted in panels E and F as functions of time. The magnitude and sign of the coefficients reveal the tuning properties of the neuron — i.e., their selectivity — in terms of the firing rate (upper panels of Figures 2E and 2F) or the periodicity (lower panels of Figures 2E and 2F) of the evoked spike trains. This applies to the full trial duration. The neuron illustrated in Figure 2 thus turns out to encode preferentially the tactile flutter stimuli in its firing rate during the stimulation periods (upper panel of Figure 2E), and not during the acoustic flutter task (upper panel of Figure 2F). This analysis was extended to the entire neuronal population of area 3b for either the tactile discrimination task (Figure 2G) or the acoustic discrimination task (Figure 2H). The analysis showed that area 3b neurons encoded information about the tactile flutter stimuli periods only (Figure 2G). However, we also found that a few area 3b neurons responded during the stimulation periods in the acoustic discrimination task (Table 1). Their responses were weak and could occur during the stimulus periods, but were not modulated by the acoustic stimuli (Figure 2H). Also, their response latencies (mean: 223.92 ms, standard deviation [SD]: 43.6) were significantly longer (one-tailed t test, p < 0.01) in comparison to those evoked by the tactile flutter stimuli (mean: 27.78 ms, SD: 10.35). We also explored the possibility that area 3b neurons predicted in their activities the animal's choice (Experimental Procedures). For this, we sorted the responses into hits and errors and calculated a choice probability index (Britten et al., 1996Britten K.H. Newsome W.T. Shadlen M.N. Celebrini S. Movshon J.A.

This quantified for each (f1, f2) pair whether responses during error trials were different from responses during correct trials. Choice probability indices were computed separately for neurons that encoded information about the flutter tactile stimuli and for those neurons that simply responded during either task. The result is shown in Figure 7, which plots the choice probability index as a function of time for both tasks. None of the area 3b neurons predicted in their activities the animal's choice, neither through firing rate nor through modulation periodicity. The results show that the responses of area 3b neurons encode tactile flutter stimuli only during the stimulation periods, and not during the working memory and decision-making components of this task. The results described above prompted us to investigate whether the same encoding scheme observed in area 3b occurred also in area 1, or whether bimodal responses could be recorded in this somatosensory area. We recorded from 132 single neurons in area 1, again while monkeys discriminated either tactile or acoustic pairs of flutter stimuli (Figure 1A; Table 1). All these neurons had larger cutaneous receptive fields compared to those of area 3b neurons and were often confined to two fingertips. We applied the same analysis described for area 3b neurons. In general, the neuronal population of area 1 responded similarly to the neuronal population of area 3b. Most neurons responded to the tactile flutter stimuli (Figure 3A ) and not to the acoustic flutter stimuli (Figure 3B). The example area 1 neuron of Figure 3 illustrates this fact. Clearly, it increased its firing rate as a function of the increasing tactile flutter rate (first and third panels Figure 3C), but was insensitive to the acoustic flutter rate (first and third panels of Figure 3D). The coefficients values a1 (f1) and a2 (f2) reflect this as well, both in terms of the cell's firing rate (upper panels of Figures 3E and 3F) and periodicity (lower panels of Figures 3E and 3F). These observations were true at the population level too in terms of firing rate (upper panel of Figure 3G) and periodicity (lower panel of Figure 3G). Thus area 1 did not encode information about the acoustic flutter, neither through the firing rate (upper panel of Figure 3H) nor through periodicity (lower panel of Figure 3H) in any of the relevant periods of these tasks. In addition to these results, we found some neurons in area 1 that not only responded bris"
https://openalex.org/W2057537493,"Acidification of synaptic vesicles by the vacuolar proton ATPase is essential for loading with neurotransmitter. Debated findings have suggested that V-ATPase membrane domain (V0) also contributes to Ca2+-dependent transmitter release via a direct role in vesicle membrane fusion, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. We now report a direct interaction between V0 c-subunit and the v-SNARE synaptobrevin, constituting a molecular link between the V-ATPase and SNARE-mediated fusion. Interaction domains were mapped to the membrane-proximal domain of VAMP2 and the cytosolic 3.4 loop of c-subunit. Acute perturbation of this interaction with c-subunit 3.4 loop peptides did not affect synaptic vesicle proton pump activity, but induced a substantial decrease in neurotransmitter release probability, inhibiting glutamatergic as well as cholinergic transmission in cortical slices and cultured sympathetic neurons, respectively. Thus, V-ATPase may ensure two independent functions: proton transport by a fully assembled V-ATPase and a role in SNARE-dependent exocytosis by the V0 sector."

Although the cascade of transcription factors that leads to specification of the serotonergic phenotype has been well characterized, its interactions with electrical activity are not known. Here we show that spontaneous calcium spike activity in the hindbrain of developing Xenopus laevis larvae modulates the specification of serotonergic neurons via regulation of expression of the Lmx1b transcription factor. Activity acts downstream of Nkx2.2 but upstream of Lmx1b, leading to regulation of the serotonergic phenotype. Using global manipulation of activity and targeted alteration of Lmx1b expression, we also demonstrate that changes in the number of serotonergic neurons change larval swimming behavior. The results link activity-dependent regulation of a transcription factor to transmitter specification and altered behavior."

The current study aimed to replicate this association in the Chinese population and further analyze their effects on biphasic insulin secretion. Methods/Principal Findings SNPs from GCK, GCKR, G6PC2 and MTNR1B were genotyped in the Shanghai Chinese, including 3,410 type 2 diabetes patients and 3,412 controls. The controls were extensively phenotyped for the traits related to glucose metabolism and insulin secretion. We replicated the association between GCK rs1799884, G6PC2 rs16856187 and MTNR1B rs10830963 and fasting glucose in our samples (p = 0.0003∼2.0×10−8). GCK rs1799884 and G6PC2 rs16856187 showed association to HOMA-β, insulinogenic index and both first- and second-phases insulin secretion (p = 0.0030∼0.0396). MTNR1B rs10830963 was associated to HOMA-β, insulinogenic index and first-phase insulin secretion (p = 0.0102∼0.0426), but not second-phase insulin secretion (p = 0.9933). Combined effect analyses showed individuals carrying more risk allele for high fasting glucose tended to have a higher glucose levels at both fasting and 2 h during OGTTs (p = 1.7×10−13 and 0.0009, respectively), as well as lower HOMA-β, insulinogenic index and both first- and second-phases insulin secretion (p = 0.0321∼1.1×10−7). Conclusions/Significance We showed that SNPs from GCK, G6PC2 and MTNR1B modulated the fasting glucose levels in the normoglycaemic population while SNPs from G6PC2 and GCKR was associated with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, we found GCK and G6PC2 genetic variants were associated to both first- and second-phases insulin secretion while MTNR1B genetic variant was associated with first-phase insulin secretion, but not second-phase insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2075703130,"Background Understanding the role of different classes of T cells during HIV infection is critical to determining which responses correlate with protective immunity. To date, it is unclear whether alterations in regulatory T cell (Treg) function are contributory to progression of HIV infection. Methodology FOXP3 expression was measured by both qRT-PCR and by flow cytometry in HIV-infected individuals and uninfected controls together with expression of CD25, GITR and CTLA-4. Cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and cell proliferation was assessed by CFSE dilution. Principal Findings HIV infected individuals had significantly higher frequencies of CD4+FOXP3+ T cells (median of 8.11%; range 1.33%–26.27%) than healthy controls (median 3.72%; range 1.3–7.5%; P = 0.002), despite having lower absolute counts of CD4+FOXP3+ T cells. There was a significant positive correlation between the frequency of CD4+FOXP3+ T cells and viral load (rho = 0.593 P = 0.003) and a significant negative correlation with CD4 count (rho = −0.423 P = 0.044). 48% of our patients had CD4 counts below 200 cells/µl and these patients showed a marked elevation of FOXP3 percentage (median 10% range 4.07%–26.27%). Assessing the mechanism of increased FOXP3 frequency, we found that the high FOXP3 levels noted in HIV infected individuals dropped rapidly in unstimulated culture conditions but could be restimulated by T cell receptor stimulation. This suggests that the high FOXP3 expression in HIV infected patients is likely due to FOXP3 upregulation by individual CD4+ T cells following antigenic or other stimulation. Conclusions/Significance FOXP3 expression in the CD4+ T cell population is a marker of severity of HIV infection and a potential prognostic marker of disease progression."

We hypothesised that the seed or fruit set of two plant species, typically pollinated by bumblebees and/or honeybees might respond in one of two ways: 1) pollination success could be reduced when growing in a floriferous environment, via competition for pollinators, or 2) pollination success could be enhanced because of increased pollinator abundance in the vicinity.We compared the pollination success of experimental plants of Glechoma hederacea L. and Lotus corniculatus L. growing in gardens and arable farmland. On the farms, the plants were placed either next to a mass-flowering crop (oilseed rape, Brassica napus L. or field beans, Vicia faba L.) or next to a cereal crop (wheat, Triticum spp.). Seed set of G. hederacea and fruit set of L. corniculatus were significantly higher in gardens compared to arable farmland. There was no significant difference in pollination success of G. hederacea when grown next to different crops, but for L. corniculatus, fruit set was higher in the plants growing next to oilseed rape when the crop was in flower.The results show that pollination services can limit fruit set of wild plants in arable farmland, but there is some evidence that the presence of a flowering crop can facilitate their pollination (depending on species and season). We have also demonstrated that gardens are not only beneficial to pollinators, but also to the process of pollination."
https://openalex.org/W2005275218,"TULA-1 (UBASH3A/STS-2) and TULA-2 (p70/STS-1) represent a novel class of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Previous studies suggest that TULA-2 is sequence-selective toward phosphotyrosyl (Tyr(P)) peptides. In this work the substrate specificity of TULA-1 and -2 was systematically evaluated by screening a combinatorial Tyr(P) peptide library. Although TULA-1 showed no detectable activity toward any of the Tyr(P) peptides in the library, TULA-2 recognizes two distinct classes of Tyr(P) substrates. On the N-terminal side of Tyr(P), the class I substrates contain a proline at the Tyr(P)-1 position, a hydrophilic residue at the Tyr(P)-2 position, and aromatic hydrophobic residues at positions Tyr(P)-3 and beyond. The class II substrates typically contain two or more acidic residues, especially at Tyr(P)-1 to Tyr(P)-3 positions, and aromatic hydrophobic residues at other positions. At the C-terminal side of Tyr(P), TULA-2 generally prefers acidic and aromatic residues. The library screening results were confirmed by kinetic analysis of representative peptides selected from the library as well as Tyr(P) peptides derived from various Tyr(P) proteins. TULA-2 is highly active toward peptides corresponding to the Tyr(P)-323 and Tyr(P)-352 sites of Syk, and the Tyr(P)-397 site of focal adhesion kinase and has lower activity toward other Tyr(P) sites in these proteins. In glycoprotein VI-stimulated platelets, knock-out of the TULA-2 gene significantly increased the phosphorylation level of Syk at Tyr-323 and Tyr-352 sites and to a lesser degree at the Tyr-525/526 sites. These results suggest that Syk is a bona fide TULA-2 substrate in platelets."
https://openalex.org/W2028805622,"In the retina, it is not well understood how visual processing depends on AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Here we investigated how these receptors contribute to contrast coding in identified guinea pig ganglion cell types in vitro. NMDA-mediated responses were negligible in ON alpha cells but substantial in OFF alpha and delta cells. OFF delta cell NMDA receptors were composed of GluN2B subunits. Using a novel deconvolution method, we determined the individual contributions of AMPA, NMDA, and inhibitory currents to light responses of each cell type. OFF alpha and delta cells used NMDA receptors for encoding either the full contrast range (alpha), including near-threshold responses, or only a high range (delta). However, contrast sensitivity depended substantially on NMDA receptors only in OFF alpha cells. NMDA receptors contribute to visual contrast coding in a cell-type-specific manner. Certain cell types generate excitatory responses using primarily AMPA receptors or disinhibition."

The tendency of a lipoprotein to form fused particles is considered to be related to its atherogenic potential. We aimed to isolate and characterize aggregated and nonaggregated subfractions of LDL from human plasma, paying special attention to particle fusion mechanisms. Aggregated LDL was almost exclusively found in electronegative LDL (LDL(−)), a minor modified LDL subfraction, but not in native LDL (LDL(+)). The main difference between aggregated (agLDL(−)) and nonaggregated LDL(−) (nagLDL(−)) was a 6-fold increased phospholipase C-like activity in agLDL(−). agLDL(−) promoted the aggregation of LDL(+) and nagLDL(−). Lipoprotein fusion induced by α-chymotrypsin proteolysis was monitored by NMR and visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Particle fusion kinetics was much faster in agLDL(−) than in nagLDL(−) or LDL(+). NMR and chromatographic analysis revealed a rapid and massive phospholipid degradation in agLDL(−) but not in nagLDL(−) or LDL(+). Choline-containing phospholipids were extensively degraded, and ceramide, diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, and phosphorylcholine were the main products generated, suggesting the involvement of phospholipase C-like activity.

The properties of agLDL(−) suggest that this subfraction plays a major role in atherogenesis by triggering lipoprotein fusion and cholesterol accumulation in the arterial wall. Atherosclerosis is a consequence of the excessive deposition of cholesterol in the intimal vessel wall, coming mainly from plasma LDL. It is widely accepted that lipoprotein retention mediated by the binding of LDL to proteoglycans is a key event in atherogenesis (1Camejo G. Hurt-Camejo E. Wiklund O. Bondjers G. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 205-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In this environment, chemical modification of trapped LDL triggers an inflammatory response that promotes localized leukocyte recruitment, cell proliferation, and apoptotic processes (2Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19359) Google Scholar). Oxidation of LDL is the most widely studied mechanism of modification, and oxidized lipids play a central role in inflammation, proliferation, and apoptosis (3Navab M. Berliner J.A. Watson A.D. Hama S.Y. Territo M.C. Lusis A.J. Shih D.M. Van Lenten B.J. Frank J.S. Demer L.L. Edwards P.A. Fogelman A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). However, other modifications, such as degradation by phospholipases, cholesteryl esterase, or proteases, also occur in the intima of the arterial wall and have a more relevant role than oxidation in lipoprotein trapping (4Bhakdi S. Lackner K.J. Han S.R. Torzewski M. Husmann M. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 91: 639-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These modifications favor LDL aggregation and fusion in the arterial wall, precluding its exit to the bloodstream and accelerating the development of the disease (5Williams K.J. Tabas I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Thus, the tendency of a lipoprotein to form fused particles is related to its atherogenic potential. In addition to the modified forms of LDL that occur in the vessel wall, several minor forms have been detected in blood. A common characteristic is an increase of the electronegative charge of the particle. This feature has been used to isolate electronegative LDL (LDL(−)). 7The abbreviations used are: LDL(−)electronegative LDLagLDL(−)aggregated electronegative LDLapoapolipoproteinBHTbutylated hydroxytolueneDAGdiacylglycerolGGEnondenaturing acrylamide gradient gel electrophoresisIDLintermediate density lipoproteinLDL(+)native electropositive LDLLPClysophosphatidylcholineMAGmonoacylglycerolnagLDL(−)nonaggregated electronegative LDLNEFAnonesterified fatty acidoxLDLoxidized LDLPAF-AHplatelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolasePCphosphatidylcholinePLCphospholipase CSMsphingomyelinSMasesphingomyelinaseTEMtransmission electron microscopy.

Regarding its physicochemical characteristics, apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) in LDL(−) presents structural differences versus apoB in native LDL (15Asatryan L. Hamilton R.T. Isas J.M. Hwang J. Kayed R.

Mei G. Brunelli R. Greco G. Lenzi L. Maulucci G. Nicolai E. Papi M. Arcovito G. Tosatto S.C. Ursini F. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 2350-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our group recently reported that LDL(−) has several populations with normal or high binding affinity to proteoglycans compared with native LDL (1Camejo G. Hurt-Camejo E. Wiklund O. Bondjers G. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 205-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). LDL(−) fractions with increased affinity to proteoglycans presented a higher content of aggregated particles. This finding suggests that an aggregated subfraction of LDL(−) could be retained more strongly in the arterial wall than the bulk of nonaggregated LDL(−). However, the specific characteristics of this aggregated subpopulation have not been studied to date. electronegative LDL aggregated electronegative LDL apolipoprotein butylated hydroxytoluene diacylglycerol nondenaturing acrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis intermediate density lipoprotein native electropositive LDL lysophosphatidylcholine monoacylglycerol nonaggregated electronegative LDL nonesterified fatty acid oxidized LDL platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase phosphatidylcholine phospholipase C sphingomyelin sphingomyelinase transmission electron microscopy. The aim of the current study was to isolate aggregated and nonaggregated LDL(−) fractions from human plasma and study their physicochemical characteristics. Special attention was paid to the mechanism of particle fusion because this feature plays a key role in subendothelial lipoprotein retention (20Oörni K. Pentikäinen M.O. Ala-Korpela M. Kovanen P.T. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1703-1714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that aggregated LDL(−) has high intrinsic phospholipase (PLC)-like activity. This activity makes this subfraction prone to particle fusion and promotes the aggregation of nonaggregated LDL subfractions. These properties suggest that the aggregated LDL(−) subfraction has a major atherogenic role, favoring subendothelial cholesterol accumulation. All of the reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee, and all volunteers gave informed consent. Total LDL (density range, 1.019–1.050 g/ml) was isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers by sequential ultracentrifugation using KBr gradients. VLDL and intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) were isolated in 6 h at 200,000 × g (50,000 rpm), and LDL was then obtained after a further 14 h at the same centrifugal force. Total LDL was subfractionated in native LDL (LDL(+)) and LDL(−) by stepwise anion exchange chromatography in an AKTA-FPLC system with a Hi-Load 26/10 Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) using buffer A (10 mmol/liter Tris, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 2 μmol/liter butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), pH 7.4) and buffer B (10 mmol/liter Tris, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 2 μmol/liter BHT, 1 mol/liter NaCl, pH 7.4), as described (21Sánchez-Quesada J.L. Camacho M. Antón R. Benítez S. Vila L. Ordóñez-Llanos J. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 166: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). LDL(+) eluted at 0.24 mol/liter NaCl, and LDL(−) eluted at 0.5 mol/liter NaCl. Both subfractions were concentrated by centrifugation with Amicon microconcentrators (10,000 molecular weight cut-off; Amicon Ultra-4, Millipore, Cork, Ireland) and submitted to gel filtration chromatography to fractionate aggregated and nonaggregated fractions. Gel filtration chromatography was performed using two on-line connected Superose 6 columns in an AKTA-FPLC system (GE Healthcare). Two ml of LDL(+) or LDL(−) at 1 g of protein/liter were eluted with buffer 10 mmol/liter Tris, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 2 μmol/liter BHT, pH 7.4, at a flow of 1 ml/min, and fractions of 1 ml were collected and concentrated with Amicon microconcentrators. All of the isolation steps were performed at 4 °C, and the buffers and density solutions contained 1 mmol/liter EDTA and 2 μmol/liter BHT. All of the analyses were performed within 3 days of isolation except HPLC and TLC studies, in which lipid extracts were made within 3 days and dry pellets were frozen at −80 °C under nitrogen and analyzed within 1 month. Major components of LDL subfractions, including apoB, total cholesterol, triglyceride, total phospholipids, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and free glycerol were measured by commercial methods adapted to a Hitachi 917 autoanalyzer, as described (21Sánchez-Quesada J.L.

ApoE, apoC-III, apoA-I, and apoA-II (Kamiya, Seattle, WA) were quantified manually using commercial methods adapted to measure low concentrations (19Bancells C. Benítez S. Jauhiainen M.

Briefly, 100 μl of reagent 1 (Tris buffer) were mixed with 100 μl of LDL at 0.4 g of protein/liter and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Afterward, 50 μl of reagent 2 (antiserum) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Absorbance was measured in a microtiter plate reader at the wavelength recommended by the manufacturer. A standard curve was performed with an apolipoprotein multi-calibrator (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA) diluted 1/5 to 1/100. Total protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin (SM), and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) were quantified by normal phase HPLC in a Gold System chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA), as described (23Benítez S.

Dipalmitoyl-glycero-phosphodimethyl ethanolamine was used as an internal standard. Briefly, 25 μl of dipalmitoyl-glycero-phosphodimethyl ethanolamine at 20 g/liter in ethanol were added to 200 μl of LDL (0.5 g of protein/liter), and lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method. The pellet was resuspended with 80 μl of hexane/isopropanol/water (v/v/v 6:8:1), and 20 μl of this solution were injected into a normal phase column (Luna 5-μm silica; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The mobile phase was acetonitrile:methanol:ammonium sulfate 5 mmol/liter (v/v/v 56:23:6). The peaks were detected at 205 nm using a photo diode array detector (model 168; Beckman). Lipoperoxidation was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 234 nm of the PC peak (that corresponds to oxidized PC) and expressed as the 205/234-nm ratio (17Bancells C. Benítez S. Villegas S. Jorba O. Ordóñez-Llanos J. Sánchez-Quesada J.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8186-8194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). α-Tocopherol content in LDL subfractions was determined by reverse phase HPLC in a Gold System chromatograph (24Sánchez-Quesada J.L.

Tocopherol acetate was used as an internal standard. Briefly, 250 μl of tocopherol acetate at 10 mg/liter in ethanol were added to 250 μl of LDL (0.5 g of protein/liter), and lipids were extracted with 0.5 ml of heptane and intense agitation for 1 min. The organic phase was evaporated under nitrogen. The pellets were resuspended with 80 μl of ethanol, and 20 μl were injected into a reverse phase column (Ultrasphere ODS; Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The mobile phase was acetonitrile/isopropanol/water (v/v/v 85:13:2). The peaks were detected at 290 nm using a photo diode array detector. Susceptibility to oxidation was measured by continuous monitoring of conjugated diene formation at 234 nm at 37 °C, using 100 μl of LDLs (0.05 g of protein/liter) dialyzed in PBS and 5 μmol/liter CuSO4 in a UV microtiter plate. TLC to identify major lipids was performed in silica gel plates (Partisil LK5DF; Whatmann, Middlestone, UK). The lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer using 100 μl of LDL at 0.5 g of protein/liter. The pellets were resuspended with 20 μl of chloroform and applied to the plate. The plates were developed using three sequential phases: chloroform/methanol/water (v/v/v 65:40:5) to 5 cm, toluene/diethyl ether/ethanol (v/v/v 60:40:3) to 13 cm, and heptane to 17 cm. The lipids were stained by dipping the plates in phosphomolybdate solution (5% phosphomolybdate and 5% sulfuric acid in ethanol) at room temperature for 1 min and then incubated for 7 min at 100 °C. LDL particle size was analyzed by nondenaturing acrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE), in 2–16% gels, as described (8Sánchez-Quesada J.L. Benítez S. Otal C. Franco M. Blanco-Vaca F. Ordóñez-Llanos J. J. Lipid. Res. 2002; 43: 699-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, two solutions at 2 and 16% were prepared using a stock solution of acrylamide and bisacrylamide (30% total, 5% cross-linker) and mixed using two peristaltic pumps. Fifteen μl of each LDL subfraction at 0.3 g of protein/liter were preincubated for 15 min with 5 μl of Sudan Black (0.1% w/v in ethylene glycol), and 5 μl of sucrose (50% w/v). Fifteen μl of this mixture were electrophoresed at 4 °C for 30 min at 20 V, 30 min at 70 V, and 8 h at 100 V. Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) activity was measured using 2-thio PAF (Cayman Chemicals, Tallin, Estonia) as substrate (25Benítez S. Sánchez-Quesada J.L. Ribas V. Jorba O. Blanco-Vaca F. González-Sastre F. Ordóñez-Llanos J. Circulation. 2003; 108: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). LDL fractions (10 μl of LDL at 0.25 g of protein/liter, in Tris 10 mm, EGTA 1 mm, pH 7.2) were incubated with 2-thio-PAF and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid as indicated by the manufacturer. Absorbance was measured at 414 nm at increasing times in a microtiter plate, and the slope was used to calculate PAF-AH activity (expressed as μmol/min·mg of protein). PLC-like activity was quantified by the Amplex Red method (Cayman Chemicals) using LPC (lysophospholipase C activity) or SM (sphingomyelinase (SMase) activity) as substrate (17Bancells C. Benítez S. Villegas S. Jorba O. Ordóñez-Llanos J. Sánchez-Quesada J.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8186-8194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). LDL subfractions (100 μl at 0.3 g of protein/liter) were mixed with 10 μl of substrate (LPC or SM at 5 mmol/liter in reaction buffer containing ethanol 5% and Triton X-100 2%; final concentration, 0.25 mmol/liter) and with the appropriate amount of Amplex Red, alkaline phosphatase, choline oxidase, peroxidase, and reaction buffer (100 mmol/liter Tris, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, pH 7.4), following the manufacturer's instructions. Staphylococcus sp. SMase (100 μl at 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100, and 200 milliunits/ml, final concentration) was used as a standard curve. Fluorescence production (λ excitation, 530 nm; λ emission, 590 nm) was monitored for 3 h, and the results were calculated from the maximum curve slope. SMase activity was also determined by measuring the degradation of fluorescently labeled SM (BODIPY-SM) and separation of substrate (BODIPY-SM) and product (BODIPY-ceramide) by TLC (17Bancells C. Benítez S. Villegas S. Jorba O. Ordóñez-Llanos J. Sánchez-Quesada J.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8186-8194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Activity of LDL subfractions (0.3 g of protein/liter) was evaluated by incubation with BODIPY-FL-C12-SM at 0.025 mmol/liter, (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) as substrate for 3 h at 37 °C in buffer 10 mmol/liter Tris, 10 mmol/liter Cl2Mg, pH 7.4, and separation by TLC, as described (17Bancells C. Benítez S. Villegas S. Jorba O. Ordóñez-Llanos J. Sánchez-Quesada J.L. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8186-8194Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The TLC plate was developed with 1,2-dichloroethane/methanol/water (v/v/v 90:20:0.5) to separate BODIPY-ceramide from BODIPY-SM. LDL subfractions at 1.33 g of protein/liter in PBS, containing 10 μmol/liter EDTA, 1 μmol/liter BHT, and 1 μmol/liter sodium azide were mixed with α-chymotrypsin at 0.4 g/liter in the same buffer to render a final concentration of 1.0 g of protein/liter of LDL protein and 0.1 g/liter of protease, as previously described (26Pentikäinen M.O.

Aggregation and fusion of LDL particles were analyzed by GGE, 1H NMR, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as follows. A sealed coaxial insert (outer diameter, 1.7 mm; supported by a Teflon adapter) containing 10 mmol/liter 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid in H2O was used with one of the samples as an external reference for the 1H chemical shift. This calibration was transferred to the other samples. 1H NMR spectra were acquired every 30 min for 48 h at 37 °C on a Bruker 800 MHz spectrometer. A period of 25 min was necessary for sample insertion, experimental set-up, and thermal stabilization before the acquisition of the first NMR spectrum.

LDL subfractions treated with α-chymotrypsin for 0, 3, and 24 h were absorbed and processed for negative staining with 2% potassium phosphotungstate, pH 7.0, over carbon-coated grids (30Forte T. Nichols A.V. Adv. Lipid Res. 1972; 10: 1-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Micrographs were obtained using a Jeol 120-kV JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope, with an Erlangshen ES1000W CCD camera (Gatan, Abingdon, UK). The results are expressed as the means ± SD. The SPSS 17 statistical package was used. Differences between LDL subfractions were tested with Wilcoxon's t test for paired data. Fig. 1 shows representative chromatograms performed to isolate, in a first step, LDL(+) and LDL(−) fractions by anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1A) and, in a second step, aggregated (agLDL(−)) and nonaggregated (nagLDL(−)) subfractions by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1B). The total LDL(−) proportion ranged from 3.5 to 7.0% (5.3 ± 1.2%, n = 15). Gel filtration chromatography showed that LDL(+) presented a single peak corresponding to nonaggregated LDL, although traces of aggregated particles were detectable. In contrast, LDL(−) had two well defined peaks of agLDL(−) and nagLDL(−) particles. In all of the plasma pools analyzed, agLDL(−) ranged from 5 to 20% of total LDL(−) (mean ± S.D. 14 ± 8%, n = 15), measured by its cholesterol content. Thus, agLDL(−) represents ∼0.25–1% (mean ± S.D. 0.74 ± 0.61%) of total LDL in human normolipemic plasma. The presence of aggregated and/or fused particles in LDL(−) subfractions was confirmed by measuring the turbidity of samples and by performing GGE. Supplemental Fig. 1S (panel A) shows the turbidity of LDL subfractions measured at 450 nm, as an index of aggregation. Total LDL(−) had a higher turbidity than LDL(+), whereas agLDL(−) presented higher turbidity than nagLDL(−). Supplemental Fig. 1S (panel B) shows a representative GGE of LDL(+) and LDL(−) fractions, where lipoproteins run according to their size. To demonstrate that aggregated LDL was not formed during isolation, two strategies were used. First, a simplified protocol that uses a smaller salt concentration and skips the anion exchange chromatography (see supplemental material for details) allowed the separation of a fraction with similar characteristics to agLDL(−) including high PLC-like activity (supplemental Fig. 2S). Second, LDL(+) isolated by the regular method and depleted of aggregated particles by gel filtration (nagLDL(+)) was reisolated by ultracentrifugation (see supplemental material for details). No evidence of aggregated particle formation was observed in reisolated nagLDL(+) (supplemental Fig. 3S). These observations indicate that agLDL(−) is not an artifact of the isolation procedure and that it is present in blood. Differences between LDL(+) and total LDL(−) in the relative content of major components (Table 1) concurred with previous data (21Sánchez-Quesada J.L. Camacho M. Antón R. Benítez S. Vila L. Ordóñez-Llanos J. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 166: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The composition of LDL subfractions showed dramatic differences between agLDL(−) and nagLDL(−), with total LDL(−) presenting an intermediate composition between the two subfractions. agLDL(−) had less cholesterol and phospholipid and more triglyceride than nagLDL(−). These features are compatible with VLDL or IDL, the metabolic precursors of LDL. Both lipoproteins have lower density, higher size, and higher content of apoE and apoC-III than LDL. However, the content of total protein was similar in all LDL subfractions, indicating similar density (Table 1). To investigate the possibility that VLDL or IDL could contaminate agLDL(−), we measured the content of minor apolipoproteins. ApoC-III, apoE, apoA-I, and apoA-II were increased in LDL(−) subfractions compared with LDL(+), in agreement with previous reports (21Sánchez-Quesada J.L. Camacho M. Antón R. Benítez S. Vila L.

The amount of apoE and apoC-III in agLDL(−) was much lower than usually reported (32Campos H. Perlov D. Khoo C. Sacks F.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1239-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in VLDL or IDL. Indeed, apoA-I and apoA-II also were increased in both LDL(−) subfractions, and their content was higher in agLDL(−) compared with nagLDL(−). Taken together, these data make it unlikely that agLDL(−) could be remnant VLDL or IDL.TABLE 1Composition of LDL subfractions (n = 9; except for apoE, apoC-III, apoA-I, and apoA-II, for which n = 4)LDL(+)Total LDL(−)nagLDL(−)agLDL(−)Major componentsaCholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipid, and protein are expressed as percentages of total mass.Cholesterol (%)42.5 ± 1.941.4 ± 2.242.2 ± 2.038.3 ± 3.3cp < 0.05 vs. LDL(+).,dp < 0.05 vs. total LDL(−).,ep < 0.05 vs. nagLDL(−).Triglyceride (%)6.5 ± 1.010.0 ± 2.5cp < 0.05 vs. LDL(+).7.8 ± 1.5cp < 0.05 vs. LDL(+).,dp < 0.05 vs. total LDL(−).15.0 ± 3.8cp < 0.05 vs. LDL(+).,dp < 0.05 vs. total LDL(−).,ep < 0.05 vs. nagLDL(−).Phospholipid (%)29.6 ± 1.227.4 ± 1.9cp < 0.05 vs. LDL(+).28.4 ± 1.224.9 ± 2.6cp < 0.05 vs. LDL(+).,dp < 0.05 vs. total LDL(−).,ep < 0.05 vs. nagLDL(−).Total protein (%)21.4 ± 1.821.2 ± 2.121.6 ± 1.721.8 ± 1.8Minor componentsbNEFA, apoE, apoC-III, apoA-I, and apoA-II are expressed as mol/mol protein or as mmol/mol protein, considering the molecular mass of apoB (550 kDa).NEFA (mol/mol protein)25.0 ± 5.549.7 ± 15,4cp < 0.05 vs. LDL(+).43.9 ± 13.4cp < 0.05 vs. LDL(+).57.9 ± 16.9cp < 0.05 vs. LDL(+).,dp < 0.05 vs. total LDL(−).,ep < 0.05 vs. nagLDL(−).ApoE (mmol/mol protein)21.2 ± 15.690.5 ± 21.487.8 ± 17.361.7 ± 23.7ApoC-III (mmol/mol protein)37.2 ± 20.2160.0 ± 108.9166.5 ± 116.280.2 ± 68.1ApoA-I (mmol/mol protein)54.1 ± 6.6259.9 ± 45.2151.7 ± 6.7328.6 ± 111.8ApoA-II (mmol/mol protein)14.2 ± 8.349.0 ± 6.439.5 ± 6.161.3 ± 11.0a Cholesterol, t"
https://openalex.org/W1994092027,"Presynaptic GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R) heterodimers are composed of GB(1a)/GB(2) subunits and critically influence synaptic and cognitive functions. Here, we explored local GABA(B)R activation by integrating optical tools for monitoring receptor conformation and synaptic vesicle release at individual presynaptic boutons of hippocampal neurons. Utilizing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy, we detected a wide range of FRET values for CFP/YFP-tagged GB(1a)/GB(2) receptors that negatively correlated with release probabilities at single synapses. High FRET of GABA(B)Rs associated with low release probability. Notably, pharmacological manipulations that either reduced or increased basal receptor activation decreased intersynapse variability of GB(1a)/GB(2) receptor conformation. Despite variability along axons, presynaptic GABA(B)R tone was dendrite specific, having a greater impact on synapses at highly innervated proximal branches. Prolonged neuronal inactivity reduced basal receptor activation, leading to homeostatic augmentation of release probability. Our findings suggest that local variations in basal GABA concentration are a major determinant of GB(1a)/GB(2) conformational variability, which contributes to heterogeneity of neurotransmitter release at hippocampal synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2062163694,"In recent years, many immunoregulatory functions have been ascribed to soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G). Since chemotaxis is crucial for an efficient immune response, we have investigated for the first time the effects of sHLA-G on chemokine receptor expression and function in different human T cell populations.T cell populations isolated from peripheral blood were stimulated in the presence or absence of sHLA-G. Chemokine receptors expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. sHLA-G downregulated expression of i) CCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR5 in CD4(+) T cells, ii) CXCR3 in CD8(+) T cells, iii) CXCR3 in Th1 clones iv) CXCR3 in TCR Vdelta2gamma9 T cells, and upregulated CXCR4 expression in TCR Vdelta2gamma9 T cells. sHLA-G inhibited in vitro chemotaxis of i) CD4(+) T cells towards CCL2, CCL8, CXCL10 and CXCL11, ii) CD8(+) T cells towards CXCL10 and CXCL11, iii) Th1 clones towards CXCL10, and iv) TCR Vdelta2gamma9 T cells towards CXCL10 and CXCL11. Downregulation of CXCR3 expression on CD4+ T cells by sHLA-G was partially reverted by adding a blocking antibody against ILT2/CD85j, a receptor for sHLA-G, suggesting that sHLA-G downregulated chemokine receptor expression mainly through the interaction with ILT2/CD85j. Follicular helper T cells (T(FH)) were isolated from human tonsils and stimulated as described above. sHLA-G impaired CXCR5 expression in T(FH) and chemotaxis of the latter cells towards CXCL13. Moreover, sHLA-G expression was detected in tonsils by immunohistochemistry, suggesting a role of sHLA-G in local control of T(FH) cell chemotaxis. Intracellular pathways were investigated by Western Blot analysis on total extracts from CD4+ T cells. Phosphorylation of Stat5, p70 s6k, beta-arrestin and SHP2 was modulated by sHLA-G treatment.Our data demonstrated that sHLA-G impairs expression and functionality of different chemokine receptors in T cells. These findings delineate a novel mechanism whereby sHLA-G modulates T cell recruitment in physiological and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2125252496,"SIRT1, a NAD-dependent deacetylase, has diverse roles in a variety of organs such as regulation of endocrine function and metabolism. However, it remains to be addressed how it regulates hormone release there.Here, we report that SIRT1 is abundantly expressed in pituitary thyrotropes and regulates thyroid hormone secretion. Manipulation of SIRT1 level revealed that SIRT1 positively regulated the exocytosis of TSH-containing granules. Using LC/MS-based interactomics, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K)gamma was identified as a SIRT1 binding partner and deacetylation substrate. SIRT1 deacetylated two specific lysine residues (K265/K268) in PIP5Kgamma and enhanced PIP5Kgamma enzyme activity. SIRT1-mediated TSH secretion was abolished by PIP5Kgamma knockdown. SIRT1 knockdown decreased the levels of deacetylated PIP5Kgamma, PI(4,5)P(2), and reduced the secretion of TSH from pituitary cells. These results were also observed in SIRT1-knockout mice.Our findings indicated that the control of TSH release by the SIRT1-PIP5Kgamma pathway is important for regulating the metabolism of the whole body."
https://openalex.org/W1979483421,"Phylogenetic hypotheses are increasingly being used to elucidate historical patterns of diversification rate-variation. Hypothesis testing is often conducted by comparing the observed vector of branching times to a null, pure-birth expectation. A popular method for inferring a decrease in speciation rate, which might suggest an early burst of diversification followed by a decrease in diversification rate is the gamma statistic.Using simulations under varying conditions, I examine the sensitivity of gamma to the distribution of the most recent branching times. Using an exploratory data analysis tool for lineages through time plots, tree deviation, I identified trees with a significant gamma statistic that do not appear to have the characteristic early accumulation of lineages consistent with an early, rapid rate of cladogenesis. I further investigated the sensitivity of the gamma statistic to recent diversification by examining the consequences of failing to simulate the full time interval following the most recent cladogenic event. The power of gamma to detect rate decrease at varying times was assessed for simulated trees with an initial high rate of diversification followed by a relatively low rate.The gamma statistic is extraordinarily sensitive to recent diversification rates, and does not necessarily detect early bursts of diversification. This was true for trees of various sizes and completeness of taxon sampling. The gamma statistic had greater power to detect recent diversification rate decreases compared to early bursts of diversification. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the gamma statistic as an indication of early, rapid diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2078116211,"Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system plays important roles in carcinogenesis and maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Signaling through the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) has been shown to stimulate the growth and motility of a wide range of cancer cells. γ-Synuclein (SNCG) is primarily expressed in peripheral neurons but also overexpressed in various cancer cells. Overexpression of SNCG correlates with tumor progression. In the present study we demonstrated a reciprocal regulation of IGF-I signaling and SNCG expression. IGF-I induced SNCG expression in various cancer cells. IGF-IR knockdown or IGF-IR inhibitor repressed SNCG expression. Both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase were involved in IGF-I induction of SNCG expression. Interestingly, SNCG knockdown led to proteasomal degradation of IGF-IR, thereby decreasing the steady-state levels of IGF-IR. Silencing of SNCG resulted in a decrease in ligand-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR and its downstream signaling components, including insulin receptor substrate (IRS), Akt, and ERK1/2. Strikingly, SNCG physically interacted with IGF-IR and IRS-2. Silencing of IRS-2 impaired the interaction between SNCG and IGF-IR. Finally, SNCG knockdown suppressed IGF-I-induced cell proliferation and migration. These data reveal that SNCG and IGF-IR are mutually regulated by each other. SNCG blockade may suppress IGF-I-induced cell proliferation and migration. Conversely, IGF-IR inhibitors may be of utility in suppressing the aberrant expression of SNCG in cancer cells and thereby block its pro-tumor effects.

Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is one of endocrine or paracrine/autocrine growth factors that plays an important role in cellular proliferation and migration. Liver is the principal source of circulating IGF-I (1Sjögren K. Liu J.L. Blad K. Skrtic S. Vidal O. Wallenius V. LeRoith D. Törnell J. Isaksson O.G. Jansson J.O. Ohlsson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 426-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence demonstrated that many tissues, including muscle, cartilage, bone, liver, kidney, brain, skin, and lungs, are targets of IGF-I (3Daughaday W.H. Rotwein P. Endocr.

Chem. 1986; 261: 14539-14544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I signaling in normal tissues is tightly regulated. The bioavailability of IGF-I is modulated by its binding proteins termed IGFBP. IGFBP-3 accounts for 80% of all IGF binding. IGF-I binds to IGFBP-3 in a 1:1 molar ratio (5Bach L.A. Rechler M.M.

Upon ligand binding, IGF-IR may be activated, thereby stimulating intracellular signal transduction cascades including insulin receptor substrate (IRS), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Activation of PI3K and MAPK pathways play key roles in IGF-I induced cell growth, survival, and multiplication (8Grey A. Chen Q. Xu X. Callon K. Cornish J.

These data suggest that SNCG may be a proto-oncogene that promotes tumor progression and, hence, a potential molecular target for cancer therapy. Here, we report that SNCG is involved in IGF-I signaling. IGF-I induces SNCG expression in different types of cancer cells. SNCG physically interacts with IGF-IR and IRS-2. IRS-2 mediates the interaction between SNCG and IGF-IR. SNCG knockdown results in proteasomal degradation of IGF-IR and a decrease in IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR and its downstream signaling components including IRS-1, Akt, and ERK1/2. SNCG blockade suppresses IGF-I-induced cellular proliferation and migration. IGF-I was purchased from PeproTech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ) and prepared by reconstituting in deionized water and by diluting to the appropriate concentration in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) and stored at −20 °C. Mitomycin C, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, and tyrphostin AG1024 were purchased from Sigma. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002, MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126, anti-GRP78, anti-IGF-IRβ, anti-phosphorylated IGF-IRβ (Tyr-1131), anti-Akt and phosphorylated Akt (Ser-473), anti-ERK1/2, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Another IGF-IR antibody for immunoprecipitation was from Abcam Ltd. (Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong). Anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, and anti-phosphorylated IRS-1 (Tyr-896) antibodies were from Epitomics (Burlingame, CA). Anti-SNCG antibody and anti-actin antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Breast cancer cell line T47D, hepatoma cell line HepG2, colon cancer cell line SW480, and lung cancer cell line A549 were obtained from Cell Lines Bank, Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China). The cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. All siRNAs were custom-synthesized products of Ribobio Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). The target sequences used for knockdown of SNCG, IGF-IR, IRS-1, and IRS-2 are shown in supplemental Table 1. The double-stranded siRNA duplex was dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Subconfluent proliferating cells were incubated with 50 nm siRNA in 2 ml of medium containing Lipofectamine. Cells were lysed in the radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 rpm to remove debris. The clarified cell lysates (1 mg of total proteins) were used for immunoprecipitation with primary antibodies or normal immunoglobulin G at 4 °C overnight. Then the supernatants were incubated with 40 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing in lysis buffer three times, immunoprecipitated proteins were immunoblotted. Cells were lysed with cold radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Aliquots of proteins were boiled in 2× loading buffer for 10 min, then loaded into 10% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies and appropriate HRP-secondary antibodies. Detection was performed with chemiluminescent agents. Images were gathered by the Alpha Innotech FluorChem imaging system. The protein levels were analyzed by densitometric analysis. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers. SNCG and IGF-IR were amplified by real-time PCR using the SYBR Green PCR amplification mix (total volume 25 μl) and 320 nmol/liter primers. β-Actin was also amplified as a reference gene. The primer sequences for human SNCG were 5′-ATGCGGCTGCCCACGCTCCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCTTGGCTCCCACATACAT-3′ (reverse). The primer sequences for human IGF-IR were 5′-GAATCGCATCATCATAACCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATCCTGCCCATCATACTCT-3′ (reverse). Relative quantification with the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) was done using the Ct method. The amount of SNCG or IGF-IR gene normalized to the endogenous reference gene (β-actin) is given by 2−ΔCt, where ΔCt is Ct (SNCG or IGF-IR) − Ct (β-actin). Methylation-specific PCR analysis of SNCG promoter methylation was done as described previously (39Gupta A. Godwin A.K. Vanderveer L. Lu A. Liu J.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 664-673PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, two μg of genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite and purified. The purified DNA was dissolved in 20 μl of water, and 2 μl was used for methylation-specific PCR. The primers specific for unmethylated SNCG were 5′-GGTTTTTGTATTAATATTTTATTGGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACAAAACTAAATCTCCCTACAAACTACAA-3′ (reverse). The primers specific for methylated SNCG were 5′-TCGTATTAATATTTTATCGGCGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACGAAACTAAATCTCCCTACGAACTACGT-3′ (reverse). The PCR conditions for both sets of primers were as follows: first cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, then 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30s, 52 °C for 30s, and 72 °C for 30s and a final elongation at 72 °C for 7 min. Replicate cultures of 8000 cells per well were plated in 24-well plate. The SNCG siRNA (siSNCG) or control siRNA (siCtrl) was transfected into the cells followed by treating with or without 5 ng/ml IGF-I. The medium contained 5% charcoal-stripped bovine serum and were changed every 2 days, and IGF-I was supplied. Five days after the transfection, the cells were completely digested with 0.1% of trypsin. Single cell suspension was obtained by pipetting. Cell number was counted by using a hemocytometer. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 50,000 cells/well. The cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped bovine serum. Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were treated with 2 μg/ml mitomycin C to inhibit cell proliferation. The siSNCG or siCtrl was transfected into the cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, a 1-mm scratch was placed through the middle of the confluent cultures with a pipette tip and washed twice with PBS to remove debris followed by treating with or without 5 ng/ml IGF-I. The area of scratch was recorded by taking images under a phase-contrast microscope everyday. To ensure the consistency of observation, different observing points along the gap were labeled, and the same fields were observed every day. The images of the same fields of view were taken, and the gap width was measured by NIS-Elements F3.0 imaging system (Bio-Rad). One-way analysis of variance with least significant difference post hoc test (SPSS 13.0 for Windows) was used to test for the differences in cell growth. Two-way analysis of variance was used to test for the differences in cell migration over a 4-day time course. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and difference was considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. To determine whether SNCG is an IGF-I-responsive protein, the IGF-IR-positive T47D breast cancer cells were treated with different doses of IGF-I for 72 h followed by Western blot analysis of SNCG levels. Treatment with IGF-I stimulated SNCG expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Moreover, T47D cells were treated with IGF-I for different periods. A time-dependent up-regulation of SNCG by IGF-I was observed (Fig. 1A). IGF-I also induced SNCG expression in IGF-IR-positive HepG2 hepatoma cells (Fig. 1B). Similar effects were observed in A549 lung cancer cells and SW480 colon cancer cells (Fig. 1C). In addition, we investigated whether IGF-I induced SNCG expression at the transcription level. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that IGF-I significantly induced SNCG transcription (Fig. 1D). The biological effects of IGF-I are mediated by IGF-IR. IGF-IR is frequently overexpressed or constitutively activated in human tumors. To determine whether IGF-IR blockade can inhibit SNCG expression in IGF-IR-positive cancer cells, we treated HepG2 cells with AG1024, an IGF-IR inhibitor, and then treated the cells with or without IGF-I followed by Western blot analysis of SNCG expression. Treatment with AG1024 down-regulated IGF-IR levels and inhibited IGF-IR phosphorylation in the cells that were treated with or without IGF-I (Fig. 2A). Treatment with IGF-I strongly stimulated IGF-IR phosphorylation, although it also slightly down-regulated IGF-IR levels. AG1024 inhibited SNCG expression in HepG2 cells treated with or without exogenous IGF-I (Fig. 2B). In addition, we determined the effects of IGF-IR knockdown on SNCG expression. Two siRNA duplex to IGF-IRβ (siIGF-IR-1 and siIGF-IR-2) were synthesized. Both siIGF-IR-1 and siIGF-IR-2 down-regulated IGF-IR expression. Whereas IGF-I induced SNCG expression, IGF-IR knockdown blocked the induction of SNCG expression by IGF-I (Fig. 2C). AG1024 also inhibited SNCG expression in SW480 and A549 cells in which constitutively phosphorylated IGF-IR was detected (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that IGF-IR blockade can inhibit SNCG expression in IGF-IR-positive cancer cells. IGF-I can activate multiple cell signaling pathways that stimulate cellular proliferation and migration. To investigate whether IGF-I-induced canonical signaling pathways such as PI3K and MAPK pathways are involved in IGF-I up-regulation of SNCG, HepG2 cells were treated with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or MEK inhibitor U0126 followed by Western blot analysis of SNCG expression. Treatment of the cells with PI3K inhibitor abrogated the induction of SNCG expression by IGF-I (Fig. 3A). Moreover, U0126 partially inhibited IGF-I-induced SNCG expression. These data suggest that both PI3K and MAPK are involved in the induction of SNCG expression by IGF-I. Previous studies have demonstrated that SNCG promoter hypermethylation contributes to the repression of SNCG expression (39Gupta A. Godwin A.K. Vanderveer L. Lu A. Liu J.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 664-673PubMed Google Scholar). SNCG expression could be detected in both HepG2 and A549 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). Treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, could up-regulate SNCG expression in HepG2 and A549 cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that SNCG promoter might be methylated in these cells. To determine whether IGF-I had any effects on SNCG promoter methylation, we treated HepG2 and A549 cells with IGF-I followed by Methylation-specific PCR analysis of SNCG promoter methylation. Indeed, SNCG promoter was methylated in HepG2 and A549 cells (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of HepG2 and A549 cells with IGF-I could induce SNCG expression. However, IGF-I did not induce SNCG promoter demethylation (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrated that IGF-I had no effect on SNCG promoter methylation, suggesting that IGF-1 induced SNCG expression through a mechanism independent of change in the status of SNCG promoter methylation. The above-mentioned data demonstrated that both PI3K and MAPK mediated the up-regulation of SNCG by IGF-I. Biological systems contain many types of feedback circuits, both positive and negative. To determine whether SNCG reciprocally regulates IGF-I signaling, T47D cells were transfected with siSNCG or siCtrl and treated with or without IGF-I for 30 min. Two siRNA duplex to SNCG, namely siSNCG-1 and siSNCG-2, were delivered into T47D cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that both siSNCG-1 and siSNCG-2 abrogated IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR and its downstream targets, Akt and ERK1/2. In the meantime, SNCG knockdown led to a decrease in the steady-state levels of total IGF-IR but not total Akt and ERK1/2 (Fig. 4). Similar results were observed in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4). Moreover, we detected the effects of SNCG knockdown on IGF-I-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation, an immediate event downstream of IGF-IR activation. SNCG knockdown resulted in a decrease in IGF-I-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). These data further demonstrated that SNCG could potentiate IGF-I signaling.FIGURE 5SNCG knockdown inhibits IGF-I-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation and GRP78 expression. A, HepG2 cells were transfected with siCtrl, siSNCG-1, or siSNCG-2. Forty-eight hours later the cells were treated with or without 5 ng/ml IGF-I for 30 min. Total proteins were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis of phosphorylated IRS-1(Tyr-896). The levels of total IRS-1 were also detected. The relative content of phosphorylated IRS-1 (p-IRS-1), IRS-1, and SNCG after normalization to actin is shown. B, HepG2 cells were transfected with siCtrl, siSNCG-1, or siSNCG-2. Twenty-four hours later the cells were treated with or without 5 ng/ml IGF-I for 48 h. Total proteins were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis of SNCG and GRP78 expression. Twenty-microgram aliquots of total proteins were loaded. The relative content of GRP78 and SNCG after normalization to actin is shown. A representative of two independent experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition, we detected the effect of SNCG knockdown on the expression of GRP78, an IGF-I-responsive protein. Whereas IGF-I up-regulated GRP78 expression in siCtrl-transfected cells, SNCG knockdown by siSNCG-1 or siSNCG-2 inhibited the induction of GRP78 expression by IGF-I (Fig. 5B). To confirm the effects of SNCG knockdown on IGF-IR expression, we transfected HepG2 cells with three SNCG siRNA that targeted different sites within SNCG mRNA, respectively. All of these siRNA duplexes down-regulated SNCG and IGF-IR expression (Fig. 6A). To determine whether SNCG regulates IGF-IR transcription, siSNCG or siCtrl was transfected into HepG2 cells followed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of IGF-IR transcription. SNCG knockdown had no effect on IGF-IR transcription (Fig. 6B). To determine whether SNCG knockdown could promote IGF-IR degradation, HepG2 cells were transfected with siCtrl or two siRNA duplex to SNCG and treated with or without MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Whereas SNCG knockdown led to a decrease in the levels of IGF-IR, treatment with MG132 blocked the down-regulation of IGF-IR by both siSNCG-1 and siSNCG-2 (Fig. 6C). These data suggested that SNCG could stabilize IGF-IR. The abovementioned data demonstrated a functional interaction between SNCG and IGF-IR. To determine whether SNCG physically interacts with IGF-IR, the lysates of SNCG-positive HepG2 cells and SNCG-negative MCF-7 cells were immunoprecipitated with SNCG antibody or IGF-IR antibody followed by Western blotting of SNCG and IGF-IR in the immunoprecipitates. The results demonstrated that SNCG antibody co-immunoprecipitated IGF-IR in HepG2 cells but not in MCF-7 cells. Also, IGF-IR antibody co-immunoprecipitated SNCG in HepG2 cells but not in MCF-7 cells. These data indicated that SNCG physically interacted with IGF-IR (Fig. 7A). IRS-1 and IRS-2 are well known as binding proteins to IGF-IR. To determine whether SNCG is a component of IGF-IR and IRS complex, HepG2 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with SNCG, IRS-1, or IRS-2 antibodies followed by Western blotting of SNCG, IRS-1, and IRS-2 in the immunoprecipitates. The results demonstrated that SNCG preferred IRS-2 binding to IRS-1 binding (Fig. 7B). To determine whether IRS-2 mediated the physical interaction between IGF-IR and SNCG, HepG2 cells were transfected with siRNA to IRS-2 or control siRNA followed by immunoprecipitation with SNCG or IGF-IR antibodies. Two siRNA duplex to IRS-2 (siIRS2–1 and siIRS2–2) were synthesized. Whereas SNCG antibody co-immunoprecipitated IGF-IR in siCtrl-transfected cells, IGF-IR was barely detected in the immunoprecipitates from siIRS2-transfected cells (Fig. 7C). Also, IGF-IR antibody co-immunoprecipitated SNCG in siCtrl-transfected cells but not in siIRS2-transfected cells (Fig. 7C). These data indicated that IRS-2 was required for the interaction between IGF-IR and SNCG. To determine whether SNCG knockdown would impair IGF-I-induced cell growth, the abovementioned SNCG siRNA (siSNCG-1, siSNCG-2) or control siCtrl was transfected into T47D cells followed by treating with or without IGF-I. Cell proliferation was detected by counting cell numbers 5 days after IGF-I treatment. In the absence of exogenous IGF-I, SNCG knockdown did not significantly affect cell growth. Treatment of siCtrl-transfected T47D cells with IGF-I significantly increased cellular proliferation rate. SNCG knockdown led to a significant decrease in IGF-I-induced T47D cell growth (Fig. 8A). The down-regulation of SNCG by siRNA to SNCG was confirmed (Fig. 8B). Depletion of SNCG also significantly inhibited IGF-I-induced HepG2 cells proliferation (supplemental Fig. 1). Whereas treatment of siCtrl-transfected HepG2 cells with IGF-I increased cellular proliferation rate by 74%, treatment of siSNCG-transfected cells with IGF-I increased cellular proliferation rate by 44%. These results indicate that SNCG plays important roles in IGF-I-induced cellular proliferation. To determine whether SNCG knockdown impairs IGF-I-induced cell migration, the above-mentioned SNCG siRNA (siSNCG-1, siSNCG-2) or siCtrl was transfected into HepG2 cells followed by treating with or without IGF-I. The cells were treated with a subtoxic dose of mitomycin C to inhibit cellular proliferation. Cell migration was dynamically detected by a wound-healing assay over a 4-day time course (Fig. 9). In the absence of exogenous IGF-I, SNCG knockdown by siSNCG-1 and siSNCG-2 slightly suppressed cell migration. Treatment with IGF-I significantly promoted cell migration. The difference in cell migration between siCtrl-transfected cells and siSNCG-transfected cells was more dramatic in IGF-I-treated groups than that in IGF-I-untreated groups (Fig. 9, A and B). Silencing of SNCG dramatically inhibited IGF-I-induced cell migration. The down-regulation of SNCG by siRNA to SNCG was confirmed (Fig. 9C). These data indicate that SNCG promotes IGF-I-induced cell migration. Multiple lines of evidence have shown that IGF-I signaling plays important roles in tumor progression. Intensive studies have been undertaken to understand IGF-I system components. The genes that were identified as IGF-I-responsive genes are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration, all of which are consistent with the known functions of IGF-I. It should be noted that the IGF-I-responsive gene portfolio may be cell type-specific or context-dependent. Previous studies demonstrated that IGF-I could up-regulate the expression of some oncogenes, including c-jun, twist, and TEL (40Chiou S.T. Chang W.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 41Monnier D. Boutillier A.L. Giraud P. Chiu R. Aunis D. Feltz P. Zwiller J. Loeffler J.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis of IGF-I signaling in 3T3-L1 cells also revealed that IGF-I up-regulated the mitogen heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (42Dupont J. Khan J. Qu B.H. Metzler P. Helman L. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4969-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The IGF system has been implicated in various types of human tumors including breast cancer, liver cancer, colon cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Here, we identified SNCG as a novel IGF-I-responsive gene. Treatment with IGF-I up-regulated SNCG expression, while IGF-IR inhibitor suppressed SNCG expression. Whereas IGF-I signaling to HB-EGF expression depends on MAPK but does not require PI3K (42Dupont J. Khan J. Qu B.H. Metzler P. Helman L. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4969-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the up-regulation of SNCG by IGF-I requires both PI3K and MAPK activity. The biological effects of IGF-I are mediated by its receptor, IGF-IR. Whereas the EGF receptor family of receptors can be activated by overexpression, IGF-IR is barely activated by overexpression and can be activated by ligands (20Reinmuth N. Fan F. Liu W. Parikh A.A. Stoeltzing O. Jung Y.D. Bucana C.D. Radinsky R. Gallick G.E. Ellis L.M. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 1377-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The increased expression of IGF-IR may result in an enhanced response to IGF-I that is manifested in greater downstream signaling through PI3K and MAPK. Interestingly, here we show that SNCG interacts with IGF-IR. Further study demonstrates that SNCG is a component of the IGF-IR and IRS complex. It is well known that IRS acts as adaptor proteins to mediate diverse signaling events. Although IRS-1 and IRS-2 are structurally similar, they may display differential affinity for a given protein, indicating that there are functional differences between IRS-1 and IRS-2 (43Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Pons S. White M.F. Benito M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our results are in agreement with this scenario in showing that IRS-2, but not IRS-1, mediates the interaction between SNCG and IGF-IR. Silencing of SNCG leads to a decrease in the steady-state levels of IGF-IR, which correlates with a decrease in IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR, IRS-1, Akt, and MAPK. The effects of SNCG expression on IGF-IR levels cannot be attributable to change in IGF-IR transcription. Instead, it appears that SNCG may prevent the degradation of ligand-unoccupied IGF-IR. The degradation of receptor-tyrosine kinases is commonly triggered by ligand binding, which represents a negative feed-back regulation of receptor signaling thereby limiting the duration of the response to ligands (44Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar). Exposure to IGF-I initiates signal transduction cascades followed by the degradation of IGF-IR (45Lu Z. Hunter T. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 435-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of IGF-IR by IGF-I binding appears to precede the induction of SNCG expression. Overexpression of SNCG may stabilize IGF-IR and thereby enhance the magnitude of the following rounds of signaling in response to IGF-I stimulation. Alternatively, IGF-I-induced SNCG expression may boost signaling through multiple pathways that are regulated by SNCG. The effects of IGF-I on cell proliferation, survival, and migration may be mediated by its downstream targets. Silencing of SNCG inhibits IGF-I-induced expression of GRP78, an IGF-I-responsive molecular chaperone (46Shen J. Riggs P.K. Hensley S.C. Schroeder L.J. Traner A.R. Kochan K.J. Person M.D. DiGiovanni J. Mol. Carcinog. 2007; 46: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Given that GRP78 is a multifunctional protein involved in diverse cellular processes, including the folding and processing of newly synthesized proteins, regulation of calcium homeostasis, modulation of the unfolded protein response, and drug resistance (47Lee A.S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3496-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), SNCG may indirectly regulate these cellular processes through IGF-IR and GRP78. Notably, SNCG itself is also up-regulated by IGF-I in PI3K- and MAPK-dependent manner. These data suggest that a positive feedback loop exists among SNCG and IGF-I axis. A similar feedback loop is present among IGF-I, HB-EGF, and MAPK. IGF-I induces HB-EGF gene transcription and promotes the cleavage and release of membrane-bound, cell surface HB-EGF with subsequent activation of EGF receptors, which is essential for the activation of MAPK by IGF-I (48Roudabush F.L. Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22583-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Our study suggests that SNCG is an important regulator of IGF-IR and a mediator for IGF-I signaling. Activation of the IGF system is known to have substantial pleiotrophic effects on mammalian cells (49Zhang X. Yee D. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The current study clearly demonstrates that SNCG is regulated by IGF-I and promotes IGF-I-induced cellular proliferation and migration. As a multifunctional protein, SNCG also stimulates estrogen-induced cell proliferation (36Jiang Y. Liu Y.E. Lu A. Gupta A. Goldberg I.D. Liu J. Shi Y.E. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3899-3903PubMed Google Scholar, 37Jiang Y. Liu Y.E. Goldberg I.D. Shi Y.E. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4539-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that SNCG is a pro-metastasis gene. SNCG overexpression correlates with metastasis in breast carcinoma (31Guo J. Shou C. Meng L. Jiang B. Dong B. Yao L. Xie Y. Zhang J. Chen Y. Budman D.R. Shi Y.E. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 121: 1296-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), pancreatic carcinoma (29Hibi T. Mori T. Fukuma M. Yamazaki K. Hashiguchi A. Yamada T. Tanabe M. Aiura K. Kawakami T. Ogiwara A. Kosuge T. Kitajima M. Kitagawa Y. Sakamoto M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 2864-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), liver cancer, and gastric carcinoma (50Liu H. Liu W. Wu Y. Zhou Y. Xue R. Luo C. Wang L. Zhao W. Jiang J.D. Liu J.W. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7635-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SNCG in breast cancer cells leads to an increase in cell motility in vitro and in tumor metastasis in vivo (33Jia T. Liu Y.E. Liu J. Shi Y.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 742-747PubMed Google Scholar). SNCG knockdown reduced perineural invasion and liver/lymph node metastasis in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer (29Hibi T. Mori T. Fukuma M. Yamazaki K. Hashiguchi A. Yamada T. Tanabe M. Aiura K. Kawakami T. Ogiwara A. Kosuge T. Kitajima M. Kitagawa Y. Sakamoto M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 2864-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ERK and Rho kinases are mediators of SNCG-enhanced cell migration (51Pan Z.Z. Bruening W. Godwin A.K. Int. J. Oncol. 2006; 29: 1201-1205PubMed Google Scholar). ERK is also required for IGF-I-induced cell migration. In agreement with the suppression of IGF-I-induced ERK phosphorylation by SNCG knockdown, our data demonstrated that silencing of SNCG significantly inhibited IGF-I-induced cell migration. Identification of IGF-I signaling axis as a novel target of SNCG may help to understand how SNCG drives tumor progression. Disruption of IGF-I signaling has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models (52Sachdev D. Yee D. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Given that the levels of SNCG and IGF-IR are mutually regulated by each other, SNCG blockade may be an alternative choice for suppressing IGF-I induced cell proliferation and migration.

Three independent sets of mutants, including swaps among different integrin β-subunits, show that C1-C2 loop lengths of 12 and longer favor the low affinity state and masking of ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) epitopes. Shortening length from 12 to 4 residues progressively increases ligand binding and LIBS epitope exposure. Compared with length, the loop sequence had a smaller effect, which was ascribable to stabilizing loop conformation, and not interactions with the α-subunit. The data together with structural calculations support the concept that the C1-C2 loop is an entropic spring and an emerging theme that disordered regions can regulate allostery. Diversity in the length of this loop may have evolved among integrin β-subunits to adjust the equilibrium between the bent and extended conformations at different set points."

Candida maltosa is able to ferment glucose as well as xylose to produce a significant amount of ethanol. Here we report the ADH system in C. maltosa composed of three microbial group I ADH genes (CmADH1, CmADH2A and CmADH2B), mainly focusing on its metabolic regulation and physiological function.Genetic analysis indicated that CmADH2A and CmADH2B tandemly located on the chromosome could be derived from tandem gene duplication. In vitro characterization of enzymatic properties revealed that all the three CmADHs had broad substrate specificities. Homo- and heterotetramers of CmADH1 and CmADH2A were demonstrated by zymogram analysis, and their expression profiles and physiological functions were different with respect to carbon sources and growth phases. Fermentation studies of ADH2A-deficient mutant showed that CmADH2A was directly related to NAD regeneration during xylose metabolism since CmADH2A deficiency resulted in a significant accumulation of glycerol.Our results revealed that CmADH1 was responsible for ethanol formation during glucose metabolism, whereas CmADH2A was glucose-repressed and functioned to convert the accumulated ethanol to acetaldehyde. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of function separation and glucose repression of ADH genes in xylose-fermenting yeasts. On the other hand, CmADH1 and CmADH2A were both involved in ethanol formation with NAD regeneration to maintain NADH/NAD ratio in favor of producing xylitol from xylose. In contrast, CmADH2B was expressed at a much lower level than the other two CmADH genes, and its function is to be further confirmed."

Studies in behaving animals performing a multisensory task provide an ideal means to elucidate the underlying neural basis, and a new study by Lemus et al. in this issue of Neuron thrusts in this direction. Multisensory integration is central to perception, and recent work drafts it as a distributed process involving many and even primary sensory cortices. Studies in behaving animals performing a multisensory task provide an ideal means to elucidate the underlying neural basis, and a new study by Lemus et al. in this issue of Neuron thrusts in this direction. The plurality of our senses offers behavioral superiority, because we often perceive our environment more accurately when combining evidence across the modalities. Given the manifold impact of the brain's multisensory nature on perception and behavior, there is considerable interest in the questions of where and how our brain merges the sensory information (Stein and Stanford, 2008Stein B.E. Stanford T.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Recently, a number of studies highlighted the role of early sensory areas in this process, and demonstrated signs of multisensory processing even down to primary sensory cortices (Ghazanfar and Schroeder, 2006Ghazanfar A.A. Schroeder C.E. Trends Cogn. Sci. 2006; 10: 278-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, Kayser and Logothetis, 2007Kayser C. Logothetis N.K. Brain Struct. Funct. 2007; 212: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). At times, these were taken to suggest that primary cortices have access to information captured by other modalities. In this issue of Neuron, Lemus et al., 2010Lemus L. Hernandez A. Luna R. Zainos A. Romo R. Neuron. 2010; 67 (this issue): 335-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar put this notion to a test by directly probing whether neurons in primary auditory and somatosensory cortices encode information about stimuli presented to the other modality. In their study, the authors employed variants of the flutter discrimination task, which has been extensively used to study the neural underpinnings of sensory encoding, short-term memory, and decision making in nonhuman primates (Romo and Salinas, 2003Romo R. Salinas E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Monkeys were trained to discriminate vibrating stimuli that were presented either as tactile sensation to the finger tip or as an acoustic pulse train to the ears. During each trial, two stimuli of different frequency were presented, interspersed with a short retention interval, and the animal had to decide which of the two stimuli was of higher frequency. While the animals performed this task with high proficiency, the authors recorded the activity of neurons in primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (S1 and S2, respectively) and in primary auditory cortex (A1). The central questions asked by Lemus and colleagues were the following: do neurons in S1 (or A1) respond also to stimuli presented to the auditory (somatosensory) modality? And if so, do their responses provide information about the identity of the presented stimulus (here, its flutter frequency)? A positive finding would demonstrate that neurons in primary sensory cortices not only encode events in their dominant modality (e.g., tactile stimuli in the case of S1), but are also capable of representing stimuli in other modalities. In the experiments of Lemus and colleagues, however, this was not the case. More specifically, they found that neurons in S1 encode the tactile flutter frequency by systematic variations in their firing pattern. Of the same neurons, however, only a small percentage responded during the presentation of acoustic flutter, and importantly, their responses did not vary systematically with the flutter frequency. Similarly, neurons in A1 encoded acoustic, but not tactile, flutter frequencies, despite the fact that some neurons in auditory cortex responded to the presentation of the tactile stimulus. Hence, while the firing of some neurons was affected by the presentation of a stimulus in the nonpreferred modality, the change in firing rate did not systematically encode features of stimuli in that modality. This result was consistently found for neural activity recorded during stimulus presentation and the retention period, and in tasks requiring the animals to compare two flutter stimuli in same modality or pairs of bimodal flutter stimuli, and in tasks requiring the animals to compare flutter frequencies across both modalities. How does this result fit with the multisensory nature of early sensory cortices as suggested by previous work? Numerous studies measuring field potentials or functional imaging signals have reported auditory cortex activations to either visual or somatosensory stimuli, and together with neuroanatomical studies provide compelling evidence for the presence of synaptic inputs from other sensory modalities to auditory cortex (Kayser and Logothetis, 2007Kayser C. Logothetis N.K. Brain Struct. Funct. 2007; 212: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, Smiley et al., 2007Smiley J.F. Hackett T.A. Ulbert I. Karmas G. Lakatos P. Javitt D.C. Schroeder C.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 502: 894-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). And in the same areas, single-neuron studies demonstrated multisensory response modulation, a phenomenon whereby responses to acoustic stimuli are enhanced or reduced when the same sound is presented in visual or somatosensory contexts (Bizley and King, 2008Bizley J.K. King A.J. Brain Res. 2008; 1242: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, studies in somatosensory cortex have shown that neurons can respond to nontactile stimuli, especially in conditions where these are essential parts of a behavioral task, such as during the retention of nontactile information for a later tactile choice (Zhou and Fuster, 2000Zhou Y.D. Fuster J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 9777-9782Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Still, the existence of such multisensory influences does not necessarily mean that the same responses convey information about the identity of stimuli in the other modality, and the work of Lemus et al. highlights a situation where this indeed does not seem to be the case. Should we then conclude that multisensory influences in early sensory cortices are functionally unspecific and do not provide benefits for the processing and sensory representations in these areas? Not necessarily. The experiments of Lemus and colleagues test only the most stringent interpretation of what multisensory inputs could do: provide detailed information about specific features of stimuli presented to another modality. This might indeed not be the case. However, at the level of behavior, multisensory facilitation increases the reliability of our percept and enhances the perceptual signal-to-noise ratio—benefits that concern the facilitation of processing in one modality rather than requiring the corepresentation of configural information from several modalities. And indeed, recent studies have demonstrated exactly such multisensory benefits in early sensory cortices. For example, visual and somatosensory stimuli can modulate low-frequency oscillations in auditory cortex, and by doing so, shape the excitability of local networks and mediate stimulus selection (Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009Schroeder C.E. Lakatos P. Trends Neurosci. 2009; 32: 9-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Multisensory influences also interact with attentional selection, suggesting the existence of a shared substrate for both mechanisms of selective stimulus enhancement (Lakatos et al., 2009Lakatos P. O'Connell M.N. Barczak A. Mills A. Javitt D.C. Schroeder C.E. Neuron. 2009; 64: 419-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). And multisensory influences can affect neural information coding by not only altering firing rates, but by reducing the trial-to-trial variability of responses, and can thereby increase the reliability and information carrying capacity of sensory representations in early sensory cortices (Kayser et al., 2010Kayser C. Logothetis N.K. Panzeri S. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 19-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). By virtue of such mechanisms, multisensory influences can enhance the responsiveness of local neural networks and modulate the neurons' stimulus selectivity, without introducing a corepresentation of specific attributes from other sensory modalities. While not directly tested by Lemus and colleagues, the responses of neurons during the audio-tactile task might well be in concordance with such more subtle forms of multisensory benefits. It is also important to note that the results of Lemus et al. were obtained during the presentation of stimuli that were well-perceivable to the animals and were far above perceptual threshold. Behavioral benefits of sensory integration, however, are strongest when the evidence provided by individual senses is poor, such as that for weak, faint, or obscured stimuli (Stein and Stanford, 2008Stein B.E. Stanford T.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Visual benefits for hearing, as an example, are best experienced in noisy environments like the cocktail-party setting, where visual lip-reading aids the understanding of speech. It seems likely that multisensory influences during an audio-tactile flutter task are stronger when the intensity of the stimuli is reduced and the behavioral decision more difficult. Only by probing for multisensory responses in such a regime will future studies be able to elucidate the full extent to which neurons in S1 or A1 respond to or encode stimuli presented to another modality. Despite testing only one particular and highly stringent definition of multisensory influence, the work by Lemus and colleagues makes an important point: studies in alert animals performing a multisensory task are likely the best means to understand the neural basis of why and how we perceive our environment better when having access to information from multiple modalities. Future studies could not only address the relevance of near-threshold stimuli in the same task, but could also address the relevance of ecologically and socially relevant stimuli, and the relation of attention and multisensory processing. Sensory processing in general, and sensory integration in particular, might be tuned to behaviorally relevant stimuli. In the auditory system, for example, multisensory influences have been emphasized in contexts of face-voice integration, and the use of such stimuli might uncover mechanisms of sensory interactions that go unnoticed when using more simplistic sensations (Ghazanfar, 2009Ghazanfar A.A. Hear. Res. 2009; 258: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The relation of attention and multisensory processing also deserves closer inspection, both at the level of behavior and at the level of the underlying neural processes (van Ee et al., 2009van Ee R. van Boxtel J.J. Parker A.L. Alais D. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 11641-11649Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Coherently perceived multisensory stimuli are often more salient than their individual components, and disentangling contributions from sensory integration and attention will require careful and clever task designs in which the attentional load is well controlled. Last but not least, it will be important to reveal where and how neural signs of multisensory processing directly reflect the behavioral benefits of sensory integration. Again, the study by Lemus et al. provides an excellent first step in this direction. For each of the cortical areas investigated, the authors asked whether the neural responses would predict the animals' choice in individual trials. By calculating so-called choice probabilities, an index relating neural response and behavioral performance on a trial-by-trial basis, they found that responses in primary sensory cortices (S1 and A1) did not correlate with the animals' performance. However, responses recorded from area S2 did, suggesting that S2 is closer to the stage mediating behavioral decisions in this task. It is noteworthy that a fraction of neurons in S2 responded not only to acoustic stimuli, but also encoded the acoustic flutter frequency, demonstrating bimodal frequency representations in this area. Still, whether the multisensory influence seen in S2 correlates with potential behavioral benefits of multisensory stimuli remains to be seen. For sure, systematically comparing multisensory processing and encoding across areas and directly relating this to behavioral facilitation or decisions is a key approach for future studies in providing insights into the neural basis of our multisensory percept. Do Sensory Cortices Process More than One Sensory Modality during Perceptual Judgments?Lemus et al.NeuronJuly 29, 2010In BriefRecent studies have reported that sensory cortices process more than one sensory modality, challenging the long-lasting concept that they process only one. However, both the identity of these multimodal responses and whether they contribute to perceptual judgments is unclear. We recorded from single neurons in somatosensory cortices and primary auditory cortex while trained monkeys discriminated, on interleaved trials, either between two tactile flutter stimuli or between two acoustic flutter stimuli, and during discrimination sets that combined these two sensory modalities.

https://openalex.org/W2020599345,"We have previously shown that a subset of mDpy-30, an accessory subunit of the nuclear histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase (H3K4MT) complex, also localizes at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where its recruitment is mediated by the TGN-localized ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor (ArfGEF) BIG1. Depletion of mDpy-30 inhibits the endosome-to-TGN transport of internalized CIMPR receptors and concurrently promotes their accumulation at the cell protrusion. These observations suggest mDpy-30 may play a novel role at the crossroads of endosomal trafficking, nuclear transcription and adhesion/migration. Here we provide novel mechanistic and functional insight into this association. First, we demonstrate a direct interaction between mDpy-30 and BIG1 and locate the binding region in the N-terminus of BIG1. Second, we provide evidence that the depletion or overexpression of mDpy-30 enhances or inhibits cellular adhesion/migration of glioma cells in vitro, respectively. A similar increase in cell adhesion/migration is observed in cells with reduced levels of BIG1 or other H3K4MT subunits. Third, knockdown of mDpy-30, BIG1, or the RbBP5 H3K4MT subunit increases the targeting of β1 integrin to cell protrusions, and suppression of H3K4MT activity by depleting mDpy-30 or RbBP5 leads to increased protein and mRNA levels of β1 integrin. Moreover, stimulation of cell adhesion/migration via mDpy-30 knockdown is abolished after treating cells with a function-blocking antibody to β1 integrin. Taken together, these data indicate that mDpy-30 and its interacting proteins function as a novel class of cellular adhesion/migration modulators partially by affecting the subcellular distribution of endosomal compartments as well as the expression of key adhesion/migration proteins such as β1 integrin."
https://openalex.org/W2067574737,"The presence of the prion protein (PrP) in normal human urine is controversial and currently inconclusive. This issue has taken a special relevance because prion infectivity has been demonstrated in urine of animals carrying experimental or naturally occurring prion diseases, but the actual presence and tissue origin of the infectious prion have not been determined. We used immunoprecipitation, one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry to prove definitely the presence of PrP in human urine and its post-translational modifications. We show that urinary PrP (uPrP) is truncated mainly at residue 112 but also at other residues up to 122. This truncation makes uPrP undetectable with some commonly used antibodies to PrP. uPrP is glycosylated and carries an anchor which, at variance with that of cellular PrP, lacks the inositol-associated phospholipid moiety, indicating that uPrP is probably shed from the cell surface. The detailed characterization of uPrP reported here definitely proves the presence of PrP in human urine and will help determine the origin of prion infectivity in urine."

The orientation of thousands of dunes (1, 2) within Titan's equatorial belt indicates transport of sand from west to east (by “westerly” winds), whereas all the atmospheric circulation models suggest that the winds should be in the opposite direction. A new model by Tokano (3) may have found the resolution: Although the winds are usually easterlies (as in other work), there is a blast of wind from the west for a brief interval around each equinox, and it is these stronger winds that dominate the dune orientation."
https://openalex.org/W1980214073,"Stratospheric ozone depletion, climate warming and acidification of aquatic ecosystems have resulted in elevated levels of solar radiation reaching many aquatic environments with an increased deleterious impact on a wide range of living organisms. While detrimental effects on living organisms are thought to occur primarily through DNA damage, solar UV can also damage cellular proteins, lipids and signalling pathways. Cryptosporidium, a member of the eukaryotic phylum Apicomplexa, contain numerous vesicular secretory organelles and their discharge via regulated exocytosis is essential for the successful establishment of infection. Using flow cytometric techniques we demonstrate that solar UV rapidly induces sporozoite exocytosis resulting in a significant reduction in the ability of sporozoites to attach and invade host cells. We found that solar UV induced sporozoite membrane depolarization, resulting in reduced cellular ATP and increased cytosolic calcium. These changes were accompanied by a reduction in the internal granularity of sporozoites, indicative of apical organelle discharge, which was confirmed by analysis of sporozoites with an exocytosis-sensitive dye. The precise timing of apical organelle discharge in the presence of a compatible host cell is critical for sporozoite attachment and invasion. Our results demonstrate for the first time how solar UV radiation can interfere with exocytosis, a fundamental cellular process in all eukaryotic cells. We contend that not only may the forecast increases in solar radiation in both aquatic and terrestrial environments significantly affect members of the Apicomplexa, solar UV-induced membrane depolarizations resulting in cytosolic calcium perturbation may affect a wider range of eukaryotic organisms through antagonistic effects on a myriad of calcium dependant cellular functions."
