https://openalex.org/W1972615792,"Urban areas consume more than 66% of the world's energy and generate more than 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions. With the world's population expected to reach 10 billion by 2100, nearly 90% of whom will live in urban areas, a critical question for planetary sustainability is how the size of cities affects energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Are larger cities more energy and emissions efficient than smaller ones? Do larger cities exhibit gains from economies of scale with regard to emissions? Here we examine the relationship between city size and CO2 emissions for U.S. metropolitan areas using a production accounting allocation of emissions. We find that for the time period of 1999-2008, CO2 emissions scale proportionally with urban population size. Contrary to theoretical expectations, larger cities are not more emissions efficient than smaller ones."

These include search query data for influenza-related terms, which has been explored as a tool for augmenting traditional surveillance methods. In this paper, we present a method that uses Internet search query data from Baidu to model and monitor influenza activity in China. The objectives of the study are to present a comprehensive technique for: (i) keyword selection, (ii) keyword filtering, (iii) index composition and (iv) modeling and detection of influenza activity in China. Sequential time-series for the selected composite keyword index is significantly correlated with Chinese influenza case data. In addition, one-month ahead prediction of influenza cases for the first eight months of 2012 has a mean absolute percent error less than 11%. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of search query data from Baidu in conjunction with this approach for estimation of influenza activity in China."
https://openalex.org/W2079891133,"Mayumi Ito and her colleagues show that during skin wounding in mice, melanocyte stem cells in the hair follicle are induced by melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r) signaling to migrate towards the epidermis and differentiate into mature pigment-producing cells. This mechanism allows for protection of the healing skin from ultraviolet light–induced damage. During wound healing, stem cells provide functional mature cells to meet acute demands for tissue regeneration1. Simultaneously, the tissue must maintain a pool of stem cells to sustain its future regeneration capability. However, how these requirements are balanced in response to injury is unknown. Here we demonstrate that after wounding or ultraviolet type B irradiation, melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) in the hair follicle2 exit the stem cell niche before their initial cell division, potentially depleting the pool of these cells. We also found that McSCs migrate to the epidermis in a melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r)-dependent manner and differentiate into functional epidermal melanocytes, providing a pigmented protective barrier against ultraviolet irradiation over the damaged skin. These findings provide an example in which stem cell differentiation due to injury takes precedence over stem cell maintenance and show the potential for developing therapies for skin pigmentation disorders by manipulating McSCs."

Here, we report that Sirt7 (sirtuin-7) negatively regulates HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels by a mechanism that is independent of prolyl hydroxylation and that does not involve proteasomal or lysosomal degradation. The effect of Sirt7 was maintained in the presence of the sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide and upon deletion or mutation of its deacetylase domain, indicating a non-catalytic function. Knockdown of Sirt7 led to an increase in HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels and an increase in HIF-1 and HIF-2 transcriptional activity. Thus, we identify a novel molecular function of Sirt7 as a negative regulator of HIF signaling.Background: The HIF-1 and HIF-2 transcription factors coordinate adaptive responses to hypoxia.Results: Sirt7 decreases HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels independent of its deacetylase activity.Conclusion: Sirt7 inhibits the activity of the HIF-1 and HIF-2 transcription factors.Significance: This study identifies Sirt7 as a regulator of HIF-1 and HIF-2 signaling.

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 2The abbreviations used are: HIFhypoxia-inducible factorDMOGdimethyloxalylglycineEVempty vector. 1 is a transcription factor that is essential for mediating a broad repertoire of adaptive responses to hypoxia. First identified in studies of EPO (erythropoietin) gene transcriptional regulation (1.Semenza G.L. Wang G.L.

Regulation of oxygen homeostasis by hypoxia-inducible factor 1.Physiology. 2009; 24: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). In addition, the HIF-1α subunit has adaptive functions that are independent of transcriptional activity (6.Hubbi M.E. Kshitiz Gilkes D.M. Rey S. Wong C.C. Luo W. Kim D.H. Dang C.V. Levchenko A.

The HIF-2α protein shares sequence similarity with HIF-1α and also promotes adaptive responses to hypoxia but has a more limited tissue distribution, and in some cases, it mediates distinct biological functions, including redox regulation through transactivation of the SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2) gene, which encodes manganese superoxide dismutase (7.Prabhakar N.R.

The hydroxylases contain Fe(II) in their catalytic centers and use α-ketoglutarate as a co-substrate; therefore, iron chelators, such as desferrioxamine, and competitive antagonists of α-ketoglutarate, such as dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), block hydroxylase activity and increase HIF-1α levels (8.Epstein A.C.

Several proteins that interact with HIF-1α and stimulate its proteasomal degradation independent of O2 concentration have also been identified.

We have also recently described a mechanism by which chaperone-mediated autophagy can target HIF-1α for lysosomal degradation, identifying a pathway by which HIF-1α levels can be regulated independent of the proteasome (22.Hubbi M.E.

Sir2, the founding member of the sirtuin family, was identified as a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase (23.Houtkooper R.H. Pirinen E. Auwerx J. Sirtuins as regulators of metabolism and healthspan.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), thereby linking cellular redox status to gene transcription. In mammals, there are seven Sir2 homologs (Sirt1–7), which vary in tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and enzymatic targets (23.Houtkooper R.H. Pirinen E. Auwerx J. Sirtuins as regulators of metabolism and healthspan.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Physical and functional interactions between several members of the sirtuin family and HIF proteins have recently been identified. As the founding member of the sirtuin family, the effects of Sirt1 have been best characterized. Sirt1 was identified as a HIF-2α deacetylase that augments HIF-2 (but not HIF-1) activity (24.Dioum E.M. Chen R. Alexander M.S. Zhang Q. Hogg R.T. Gerard R.D. Garcia J.A. Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α signaling by the stress-responsive deacetylase sirtuin 1.Science. 2009; 324: 1289-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 25.Chen R. Xu M. Hogg R.T.

Chem. 2012; 287: 30800-30811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A subsequent study suggested that Sirt1 may repress HIF-1 transactivation ability (26.Lim J.H. Lee Y.M. Chun Y.S. Chen J. Kim J.E. Park J.W. Sirtuin 1 modulates cellular responses to hypoxia by deacetylating hypoxia-inducible factor 1α.Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 864-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), whereas a third study reported that Sirt1 increased HIF-1α protein levels (27.Laemmle A. Lechleiter A. Roh V. Schwarz C. Portmann S. Furer C. Keogh A. Tschan M.P. Candinas D. Vorburger S.A. Stroka D. Inhibition of SIRT1 impairs the accumulation and transcriptional activity of HIF-1α protein under hypoxic conditions.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e33433Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is possible that, in different contexts, Sirt1 may have opposing effects on HIF-1 activity. Sirt6 knock-out mice develop lethal hypoglycemia early in life, which is due to the role of Sirt6 as a co-repressor of HIF-1 target genes (28.Zhong L. D'Urso A. Toiber D. Sebastian C. Henry R.E. Vadysirisack D.D. Guimaraes A. Marinelli B. Wikstrom J.D. Nir T. Clish C.B. Vaitheesvaran B. Iliopoulos O. Kurland I. Dor Y. Weissleder R. Shirihai O.S. Ellisen L.W. Espinosa J.M. Mostoslavsky R. The histone deacetylase Sirt6 regulates glucose homeostasis via Hif1α.Cell. 2010; 140: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Finally, Sirt3, which is a mitochondrial deacetylase, may regulate HIF-1 signaling in cancer cell lines (29.Bell E.L. Emerling B.M. Ricoult S.J. Guarente L. SirT3 suppresses hypoxia inducible factor 1α and tumor growth by inhibiting mitochondrial ROS production.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 30.Finley L.W.

Sirt7 is arguably the least studied of the mammalian sirtuins, although it has been reported to activate transcription by RNA polymerase I (31.Ford E. Voit R. Liszt G. Magin C. Grummt I. Guarente L.

SIRT7 links H3K18 deacetylation to maintenance of oncogenic transformation.Nature. 2012; 487: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Sirt7-null mice develop cardiac hypertrophy and inflammatory cardiomyopathy, due in part to hyperacetylation of p53 (35.Vakhrusheva O. Smolka C. Gajawada P. Kostin S. Boettger T. Kubin T. Braun T. Bober E. Sirt7 increases stress resistance of cardiomyocytes and prevents apoptosis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy in mice.Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Here, we report that HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels are regulated by Sirt7 via direct physical interactions. Sirt7 overexpression decreased HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels, HIF transcriptional activity, and target gene expression, whereas knockdown of Sirt7 had the opposite effect. This inhibitory effect of Sirt7 was preserved in the presence of nicotinamide and with Sirt7 mutants that do not possess deacetylase activity, indicating that Sirt7 inhibits HIF-1α and HIF-2α through a mechanism that is independent of its catalytic activity. Thus, these studies have revealed a novel role for Sirt7 as a negative regulator of the hypoxia response pathway. HeLa, Hep3B, MDA-MB-231, and 293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% air incubator. Cells were subjected to hypoxia by exposure to 1% O2, 5% CO2, and balance N2 at 37 °C in a modulator incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Inc.). Cells were lysed in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm NaF, followed by gentle sonication. For immunoprecipitation assays, a 2-μg aliquot of anti-Myc epitope antibody (Novus Biologicals) was incubated overnight with 2.5 mg of cell lysate at 4 °C, followed by a 3-h incubation with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The following antibodies were used in immunoblot and immunoprecipitation assays: anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HIF-1α (BD Biosciences), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-HIF-2α and anti-Myc epitope (Novus Biologicals), and anti-V5 epitope (Invitrogen). HeLa or Hep3B cells were seeded onto 24-well plates at 20,000 cells/well, and 48 h after seeding, the cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using PolyJet (SignaGen Laboratories). Reporters pSV-RL (10 ng) and p2.1 (120 ng) were cotransfected with expression vectors (31.Ford E. Voit R. Liszt G. Magin C. Grummt I. Guarente L. Mammalian Sir2 homolog SIRT7 is an activator of RNA polymerase I transcription.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were determined with a multiwell luminescence reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The coding sequences of human full-length Sirt5, Sirt6, and Sirt7 and sequences encoding deletion mutants of Sirt7 were inserted into the pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech) and verified by DNA sequence analysis. Catalytically inactive mutants of Sirt7 were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Validated shRNA vectors against Sirt7 were purchased from Sigma. Other constructs were described previously (24.Dioum E.M. Chen R. Alexander M.S. Zhang Q. Hogg R.T. Gerard R.D. Garcia J.A.

Differences between two conditions were analyzed using Student's t test. We investigated whether members of the sirtuin family are capable of interacting with HIF-1α. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Myc epitope-tagged Sirt6 interacted with coexpressed FLAG epitope-tagged HIF-1α (Fig. 1A), which was consistent with a recent report (29.Bell E.L. Emerling B.M. Ricoult S.J. Guarente L. SirT3 suppresses hypoxia inducible factor 1α and tumor growth by inhibiting mitochondrial ROS production.Oncogene. 2011; 30: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and served as a positive control. Myc-tagged Sirt5 did not interact with FLAG-HIF-1α or HIF-2α, but interaction of Myc-tagged Sirt7 with both FLAG-HIF-1α (Fig. 1A) and HIF-2α (Fig. 1B) was detected. To examine the effect of Sirt7 on the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 and HIF-2, we utilized several previously described reporter plasmids (24.Dioum E.M. Chen R. Alexander M.S. Zhang Q. Hogg R.T. Gerard R.D. Garcia J.A.

First, Hep3B human hepatocellular carcinoma cells were cotransfected with p2.1, a reporter plasmid that contains a 68-bp hypoxia response element (from the human ENO1 gene) upstream of an SV40 promoter and firefly luciferase coding sequences, and pSV-RL, a control reporter that contains Renilla luciferase coding sequences downstream of the SV40 promoter only. The ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity served as a measure of HIF transcriptional activity. In addition, we used three reporter plasmids containing the promoter regions of the EPO, VEGFA, and SOD2 genes, respectively, upstream of firefly luciferase coding sequences. We found increased p2.1 reporter activity and promoter activity of all three HIF target genes in response to HIF-1α overexpression in Hep3B cells (Fig. 2A). However, coexpression of Sirt7 inhibited this effect (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained in HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that Sirt7 can regulate HIF-1 activity in multiple cell types. Likewise, overexpression of HIF-2α led to an increase in reporter activity, which was blocked by overexpression of Sirt7, in both Hep3B (Fig. 2C) and HeLa (Fig. 2D) cells. Despite the weaker interaction of Sirt7 with HIF-1α or HIF-2α compared with Sirt6 (Fig. 1, A and B), the inhibition of HIF-1 (Fig. 2, A and B) and HIF-2 (Fig. 2, C and D) activity by Sirt7 was comparable in magnitude to that by Sirt6 in both HeLa and Hep3B cells. The differences between the co-immunoprecipitation and reporter assays suggest that additional proteins may stabilize the interaction of Sirt7 with HIF-1α or HIF-2α at HIF-binding sites in chromatin. In any case, the results demonstrate that Sirt7 is a negative regulator of HIF-1α- and HIF-2α-dependent transcriptional activity. To investigate the mechanism by which Sirt7 regulates HIF-1 and HIF-2 activity, we analyzed HIF-1α levels by immunoblot assay. Overexpression of Sirt7 led to a large decrease in HIF-1α protein levels in Hep3B (Fig. 3A), HeLa (Fig. 3B), 293T human embryonic kidney (Fig. 3C), and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer (Fig. 3D) cells. Sirt7 overexpression had a similar inhibitory effect on HIF-2α protein levels in all four cell lines (Fig. 3, A–D). Sirt7 has been reported to act as a protein deacetylase, and we investigated whether its enzymatic activity is required for the effect on HIF-1 and HIF-2 activity. Two previously described catalytically inactive mutants of Sirt7 (31.Ford E. Voit R. Liszt G. Magin C. Grummt I. Guarente L.

The deacetylase domain of Sirt7 resides in residues 90–330, and deletion of this entire region had no effect on the ability of Sirt7 to inhibit HIF transcriptional activity induced by HIF-1α overexpression (Fig. 4D), HIF-2α overexpression (Fig. 4E), or exposure of cells to hypoxia (Fig. 4F). Finally, the response of cells to treatment with nicotinamide, a broad-spectrum sirtuin inhibitor that blocks NAD+-dependent deacetylation (23.Houtkooper R.H. Pirinen E. Auwerx J. Sirtuins as regulators of metabolism and healthspan.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), was analyzed. Nicotinamide treatment itself had a large effect on HIF activity in Hep3B cells, which reflects the role of other sirtuins in regulating HIF-1 (24.Dioum E.M. Chen R. Alexander M.S. Zhang Q. Hogg R.T.

Consistent with these results, we found that catalytically inactive Sirt7 mutants retained the ability to decrease HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels (Fig. 4J), as did Sirt7 mutants with the deacetylase domain deleted (Fig. 4K). Similarly, nicotinamide had no effect on the ability of Sirt7 to decrease HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels (Fig. 4L). Taken together, the data indicate that the deacetylase activity of Sirt7 is not required for negative regulation of HIF-1 and HIF-2. Hydroxylation of HIF-1α at Pro-402 and Pro-564 leads to subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, whereas hydroxylation at Asn-803 inhibits HIF-1α transactivation domain function. To determine whether hydroxylation is necessary for the effect of Sirt7, we utilized a triple-mutant HIF-1α construct harboring P402A, P564A, and N803A mutations. Overexpression of Sirt7 inhibited reporter activity induced by overexpression of either wild-type or triple-mutant HIF-1α to a comparable degree (Fig. 5A). Similar results were observed upon overexpression of wild-type or triple-mutant HIF-2α (Fig. 5B). Immunoblot assays demonstrated that Sirt7 decreased the protein levels of triple-mutant HIF-1α and HIF-2α to a similar degree as wild-type HIF-1α and HIF-2α (Fig. 5C). Treatment with the hydroxylase inhibitor DMOG led to an increase in reporter activity induced by overexpression of HIF-1α (Fig. 5D) or HIF-2α (Fig. 5E), but DMOG did not block the inhibitory effect of Sirt7 overexpression. Likewise, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not block the effect of Sirt7 (Fig. 5F). We recently reported that HIF-1α is subject to lysosomal degradation through the process of chaperone-mediated autophagy (22.Hubbi M.E. Hu H. Kshitiz Ahmed I. Levchenko A. Semenza G.L. Chaperone-mediated autophagy targets hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) for lysosomal degradation.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 10703-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin led to an expected increase in HIF-1 (Fig. 5G) and HIF-2 (Fig. 5H) transcriptional activity but had no effect on inhibition of HIF activity that was mediated by Sirt7. Similarly, bafilomycin had no effect on the inhibition of HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels by Sirt7 (Fig. 5I). We conclude that Sirt7 exerts effects on HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels that are independent of both the proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways. To verify that Sirt7 regulates HIF-1 and HIF-2 at endogenous levels, we utilized five validated shRNA vectors targeting different sequences in Sirt7 mRNA. Knockdown of Sirt7 with each of the Sirt7 shRNA vectors led to an increase in HIF-1 reporter activity (Fig. 6A) and HIF-1α protein levels (Fig. 6B). Sirt7 knockdown likewise led to an increase in HIF-2 reporter activity (Fig. 6C) and HIF-2α protein levels (Fig. 6D). Finally, knockdown of Sirt7 led to an increase in endogenous HIF transcriptional activity induced by hypoxia in both Hep3B (Fig. 6E) and HeLa (Fig. 6F) cells. In this study, we have identified a novel role for Sirt7 as a negative regulator of HIF-1 and HIF-2 transcriptional activity. The inhibitory effect of Sirt7 was demonstrated by experiments analyzing HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels, HIF-dependent transcriptional activity of a reporter gene containing a hypoxia response element, and HIF-dependent transcription mediated by the promoters from three different HIF target genes. The mechanism by which Sirt7 functions to decrease HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels remains to be established. The effect was preserved in the presence of hydroxylase inhibitors or mutations of the HIF-1α and HIF-2α hydroxylation sites, indicating that the effect of Sirt7 is independent of the classical oxygen-dependent degradation pathway. There are hydroxylase-independent but proteasomal-dependent pathways by which HIFs are regulated (16.Baek J.H. Liu Y.V. McDonald K.R. Wesley J.B. Zhang H. Semenza G.L.

Finally, HIF-1α is targeted for lysosomal degradation through chaperone-mediated autophagy (22.Hubbi M.E. Hu H. Kshitiz Ahmed I. Levchenko A. Semenza G.L.

Chem. 2013; 288: 10703-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), but the effect of Sirt7 was also maintained in the presence of the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin. Our data suggest that there may be as yet unknown mechanisms by which HIF-1α and HIF-2α can be degraded in the presence of Sirt7. The possibility that Sirt7 regulates translation of the proteins has not been formally excluded but seems unlikely because the inhibitory effects were observed when HIF-1α and HIF-2α were expressed from vectors that lack the 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences that are present in the native mRNAs. The mechanism by which Sirt7 regulates HIF activity differs from the other sirtuins because it is independent of its deacetylase activity. The effect of Sirt7 was preserved in the presence of high concentrations of nicotinamide, which is a nonspecific inhibitor of sirtuin catalytic activity. Two point mutations in Sirt7, which have previously been shown to eliminate its enzymatic activity (31.Ford E. Voit R. Liszt G. Magin C. Grummt I. Guarente L.

SIRT7 links H3K18 deacetylation to maintenance of oncogenic transformation.Nature. 2012; 487: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), had no effect on its ability to regulate HIF-1. In fact, deletion of the entire deacetylase domain had no effect on the ability of Sirt7 to inhibit HIF signaling. Thus, Sirt7 has cellular functions that are independent of its deacetylase activity. Recent work demonstrated that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, the Sirt7 homolog SIR-2.4 indirectly regulates DAF-16 acetylation and nuclear localization by blocking CBP-mediated acetylation (37.Chiang W.C. Tishkoff D.X. Yang B. Wilson-Grady J. Yu X. Mazer T. Eckersdorff M. Gygi S.P. Lombard D.B. Hsu A.L. C. elegans SIRT6/7 homolog SIR-2.4 promotes DAF-16 relocalization and function during stress.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002948Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is possible that Sirt7 regulates HIF-1 and HIF-2 through protein-protein interactions in a similar fashion. Phylogenetic analysis divides the seven mammalian sirtuins into four classes, with Sirt6 and Sirt7 composing class IV (38.Frye R.A. Phylogenetic classification of prokaryotic and eukaryotic Sir2-like proteins.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Sirt6 has been reported to function as a transcriptional corepressor of HIF-1α through its activity as an H3K9 deacetylase (28.Zhong L. D'Urso A. Toiber D. Sebastian C. Henry R.E. Vadysirisack D.D. Guimaraes A. Marinelli B. Wikstrom J.D. Nir T. Clish C.B. Vaitheesvaran B. Iliopoulos O. Kurland I. Dor Y. Weissleder R. Shirihai O.S. Ellisen L.W. Espinosa J.M. Mostoslavsky R. The histone deacetylase Sirt6 regulates glucose homeostasis via Hif1α.Cell. 2010; 140: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Sirt6 was found to bind to HIF-1α and associate with the promoter of HIF target genes, and Sirt6 knockdown led to an increase in H3K9 acetylation specifically at those promoters (28.Zhong L. D'Urso A. Toiber D. Sebastian C. Henry R.E. Vadysirisack D.D. Guimaraes A. Marinelli B. Wikstrom J.D. Nir T. Clish C.B. Vaitheesvaran B. Iliopoulos O. Kurland I. Dor Y. Weissleder R. Shirihai O.S.

The histone deacetylase Sirt6 regulates glucose homeostasis via Hif1α.Cell. 2010; 140: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Additionally, Sirt6 appeared to have an effect on transcriptional regulation of HIF-1α itself (28.Zhong L. D'Urso A. Toiber D. Sebastian C. Henry R.E. Vadysirisack D.D. Guimaraes A. Marinelli B.

By contrast, the mechanism utilized by Sirt7 is distinct because its deacetylase activity was not required for its inhibitory effects on HIF-1 and HIF-2. Our results suggest that, despite a high degree of sequence similarity, the sirtuins function through multiple distinct mechanisms to inhibit HIF transcriptional activity. This is similar to previous observations regarding HIF regulation by different members of the SSAT (12.Baek J.H. Liu Y.V. McDonald K.R. Wesley J.B. Hubbi M.E. Byun H. Semenza G.L.

https://openalex.org/W2057567407,"The octopus sucker represents a fascinating natural system performing adhesion on different terrains and substrates. Octopuses use suckers to anchor the body to the substrate or to grasp, investigate and manipulate objects, just to mention a few of their functions. Our study focuses on the morphology and adhesion mechanism of suckers in Octopus vulgaris. We use three different techniques (MRI, ultrasonography, and histology) and a 3D reconstruction approach to contribute knowledge on both morphology and functionality of the sucker structure in O. vulgaris. The results of our investigation are two-fold. First, we observe some morphological differences with respect to the octopus species previously studied (i.e., Octopus joubini, Octopus maya, Octopus bimaculoides/bimaculatus and Eledone cirrosa). In particular, in O. vulgaris the acetabular chamber, that is a hollow spherical cavity in other octopuses, shows an ellipsoidal cavity which roof has an important protuberance with surface roughness. Second, based on our findings, we propose a hypothesis on the sucker adhesion mechanism in O. vulgaris. We hypothesize that the process of continuous adhesion is achieved by sealing the orifice between acetabulum and infundibulum portions via the acetabular protuberance. We suggest this to take place while the infundibular part achieves a completely flat shape; and, by sustaining adhesion through preservation of sucker configuration. In vivo ultrasonographic recordings support our proposed adhesion model by showing the sucker in action. Such an underlying physical mechanism offers innovative potential cues for developing bioinspired artificial adhesion systems. Furthermore, we think that it could possibly represent a useful approach in order to investigate any potential difference in the ecology and in the performance of adhesion by different species."
https://openalex.org/W2107453482,"Nitrosylation is a reversible post-translational modification of protein cysteines playing a major role in cellular regulation and signaling in many organisms, including plants where it has been implicated in the regulation of immunity and cell death. The extent of nitrosylation of a given cysteine residue is governed by the equilibrium between nitrosylation and denitrosylation reactions. The mechanisms of these reactions remain poorly studied in plants. In this study, we have employed glycolytic GAPDH from Arabidopsis thaliana as a tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms of nitrosylation and denitrosylation using a combination of approaches, including activity assays, the biotin switch technique, site-directed mutagenesis, and mass spectrometry. Arabidopsis GAPDH activity was reversibly inhibited by nitrosylation of catalytic Cys-149 mediated either chemically with a strong NO donor or by trans-nitrosylation with GSNO. GSNO was found to trigger both GAPDH nitrosylation and glutathionylation, although nitrosylation was widely prominent. Arabidopsis GAPDH was found to be denitrosylated by GSH but not by plant cytoplasmic thioredoxins. GSH fully converted nitrosylated GAPDH to the reduced, active enzyme, without forming any glutathionylated GAPDH. Thus, we found that nitrosylation of GAPDH is not a step toward formation of the more stable glutathionylated enzyme. GSH-dependent denitrosylation of GAPC1 was found to be linked to the [GSH]/[GSNO] ratio and to be independent of the [GSH]/[GSSG] ratio. The possible importance of these biochemical properties for the regulation of Arabidopsis GAPDH functions in vivo is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2022545349,"Nucleotide excision repair is the sole mechanism for removing the major UV photoproducts from genomic DNA in human cells. In vitro with human cell-free extract or purified excision repair factors, the damage is removed from naked DNA or nucleosomes in the form of 24- to 32-nucleotide-long oligomers (nominal 30-mer) by dual incisions. Whether the DNA damage is removed from chromatin in vivo in a similar manner and what the fate of the excised oligomer was has not been known previously. Here, we demonstrate that dual incisions occur in vivo identical to the in vitro reaction. Further, we show that transcription-coupled repair, which operates in the absence of the XPC protein, also generates the nominal 30-mer in UV-irradiated XP-C mutant cells. Finally, we report that the excised 30-mer is released from the chromatin in complex with the repair factors TFIIH and XPG. Taken together, our results show the congruence of in vivo and in vitro data on nucleotide excision repair in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2045110926,"Receptor(-like) kinases with Lysin Motif (LysM) domains in their extracellular region play crucial roles during plant interactions with microorganisms; e.g. Arabidopsis thaliana CERK1 activates innate immunity upon perception of fungal chitin/chitooligosaccharides, whereas Medicago truncatula NFP and LYK3 mediate signalling upon perception of bacterial lipo-chitooligosaccharides, termed Nod factors, during the establishment of mutualism with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. However, little is still known about the exact activation and signalling mechanisms of MtNFP and MtLYK3. We aimed at investigating putative molecular interactions of MtNFP and MtLYK3 produced in Nicotiana benthamiana. Surprisingly, heterologous co-production of these proteins resulted in an induction of defence-like responses, which included defence-related gene expression, accumulation of phenolic compounds, and cell death. Similar defence-like responses were observed upon production of AtCERK1 in N. benthamiana leaves. Production of either MtNFP or MtLYK3 alone or their co-production with other unrelated receptor(-like) kinases did not induce cell death in N. benthamiana, indicating that a functional interaction between these LysM receptor-like kinases is required for triggering this response. Importantly, structure-function studies revealed that the MtNFP intracellular region, specific features of the MtLYK3 intracellular region (including several putative phosphorylation sites), and MtLYK3 and AtCERK1 kinase activity were indispensable for cell death induction, thereby mimicking the structural requirements of nodulation or chitin-induced signalling. The observed similarity of N. benthamiana response to MtNFP and MtLYK3 co-production and AtCERK1 production suggests the existence of parallels between Nod factor-induced and chitin-induced signalling mediated by the respective LysM receptor(-like) kinases. Notably, the conserved structural requirements for MtNFP and MtLYK3 biological activity in M. truncatula (nodulation) and in N. benthamiana (cell death induction) indicates the relevance of the latter system for studies on these, and potentially other symbiotic LysM receptor-like kinases."

Conclusion: The three highly flexible cysteines are essential for assembly of the active site across the protein shell. Significance: Elucidation of such a copper incorporation process provides useful insights into metal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2008979236,"The Mediator complex (Mediator) plays pivotal roles in activating transcription by RNA polymerase II, but relatively little is known about its roles in repression. Here, we identified the histone arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 and WD repeat protein 77/methylosome protein 50 (WDR77/MEP50) as Mediator cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-interacting proteins and studied the roles of PRMT5 in the transcriptional regulation of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β target genes. First, we purified CDK8- and CDK19-containing complexes from HeLa nuclear extracts and subjected these purified complexes to mass spectrometric analyses. These experiments revealed that two Mediator CDKs, CDK8 and CDK19, individually interact with PRMT5 and WDR77, and their interactions with PRMT5 cause transcriptional repression of C/EBPβ target genes by regulating symmetric dimethylation of histone H4 arginine 3 (H4R3me2s) in the promoter regions of those genes. Furthermore, the recruitment of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A correlated with H4R3 dimethylation potentially leading to DNA methylation at the promoter proximal region and tight inhibition of preinitiation complex formation. In vertebrates, C/EBPβ regulates many genes involved in immune responses and cell differentiation. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms of the repressive roles of Mediator CDKs in transcription of C/EBPβ target genes and might provide clues that enable future studies of the functional associations between Mediators and epigenetic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1995803983,"Background More than 1 million tuberculosis (TB) patients are receiving directly observed treatment strategy (DOTS) therapy in China every year. As to the profile of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) due to DOTS therapy, no consensus has been reached. There is no report regarding ADRs due to DOTS therapy with a large Chinese TB population. This study aimed to determine the incidence and prognosis of ADRs due to DOTS therapy, and to evaluate their impact on anti-TB treatment in China. Methods A prospective population-based cohort study was performed during 2007–2008. Sputum smear positive pulmonary TB patients who received DOTS therapy were included and followed up for six to nine months in 52 counties of four regions in China. The suspected ADRs were recorded and reviewed by Chinese State Food and Drug Administration. Results A total of 4304 TB patients were included in this study. 649 patients (15.08%) showed at least one ADR and 766 cases in total were detected. The incidence (count) of ADR based on affected organ was: liver dysfunction 6.34% (273), gastrointestinal disorders 3.74% (161), arthralgia 2.51% (108), allergic reactions 2.35% (101), neurological system disorders 2.04% (88), renal impairment 0.07% (3) and others 0.05% (2). Most cases of ADRs (95%) had a good clinical outcome, while two with hepatotoxicity and one with renal impairment died. Compared with patients without ADRs, patients with ADRs were more likely to have positive smear test results at the end of the intensive phase (adjusted OR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.44–2.78) and unsuccessful anti-TB outcomes (adjusted OR, 2.58; 95%CI, 1.43–4.68). Conclusions The incidence of ADRs due to DOTS therapy was 15.08%. Those ADRs had a substantial impact on TB control in China. This highlighted the importance of developing strategies to ameliorate ADRs both to improve the quality of patient care and to control TB safely."
https://openalex.org/W2062285048,"P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae are major bacterial causes of corneal ulcers in industrialized and in developing countries. The current study examined host innate immune responses at the site of infection, and also expression of bacterial virulence factors in clinical isolates from patients in south India. Corneal ulcer material was obtained from 49 patients with confirmed P. aeruginosa and 27 patients with S. pneumoniae, and gene expression of Toll Like Receptors (TLR), cytokines and inflammasome proteins was measured by quantitative PCR. Expression of P. aeruginosa type III secretion exotoxins and S. pneumoniae pneumolysin was detected by western blot analysis. We found that neutrophils comprised >90% cells in corneal ulcers, and that there was elevated expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9, the NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes and the ASC adaptor molecule. IL-1α IL-1β and IFN-γ expression was also elevated; however, there was no significant difference in expression of any of these genes between corneal ulcers from P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae infected patients. We also show that 41/49 (84%) of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates expressed ExoS and ExoT, whereas 5/49 (10%) of isolates expressed ExoS, ExoT and ExoU with only 2/49 isolates expressing ExoT and ExoU. In contrast, all 27 S. pneumoniae clinical isolates produced pneumolysin. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that ExoS/T expressing P. aeruginosa and pneumolysin expressing S. pneumoniae predominate in bacterial keratitis. While P. aeruginosa strains expressing both ExoU and ExoS are usually rare, these strains actually outnumbered strains expressing only ExoU in the current study. Further, as neutrophils are the predominant cell type in these corneal ulcers, they are the likely source of cytokines and of the increased TLR and inflammasome expression."
https://openalex.org/W1989897107,"Although Aurora B is important in cleavage furrow ingression and completion during cytokinesis, the mechanism by which kinase activity is targeted to the cleavage furrow and the molecule(s) responsible for this process have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that an essential mitotic kinesin MKlp2 requires myosin-II for its localization to the equatorial cortex, and this event is required to recruit Aurora B to the equatorial cortex in mammalian cells. This recruitment event is also required to promote the highly focused accumulation of active RhoA at the equatorial cortex and stable ingression of the cleavage furrow in bipolar cytokinesis. Specifically, in drug-induced monopolar cytokinesis, targeting Aurora B to the cell cortex by MKlp2 is essential for cell polarization and furrow formation. Once the furrow has formed, MKlp2 further recruits Aurora B to the growing furrow. This process together with continuous Aurora B kinase activity at the growing furrow is essential for stable furrow propagation and completion. In contrast, a MKlp2 mutant defective in binding myosin-II does not recruit Aurora B to the cell cortex and does not promote furrow formation during monopolar cytokinesis. This mutant is also defective in maintaining the ingressing furrow during bipolar cytokinesis. Together, these findings reveal that targeting Aurora B to the cell cortex (or the equatorial cortex) by MKlp2 is essential for the maintenance of the ingressing furrow for successful cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2009010592,"Mammosphere and breast tumoursphere culture have gained popularity as in vitro assays for propagating and analysing normal and cancer stem cells. Whether the spheres derived from different sources or parent cultures themselves are indeed single entities enriched in stem/progenitor cells compared to other culture formats has not been fully determined. We surveyed sphere-forming capacity across 26 breast cell lines, immunophenotyped spheres from six luminal- and basal-like lines by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry and compared clonogenicity between sphere, adherent and matrigel culture formats using in vitro functional assays. Analyses revealed morphological and molecular intra- and inter-sphere heterogeneity, consistent with adherent parental cell line phenotypes. Flow cytometry showed sphere culture does not universally enrich for markers previously associated with stem cell phenotypes, although we found some cell-line specific changes between sphere and adherent formats. Sphere-forming efficiency was significantly lower than adherent or matrigel clonogenicity and constant over serial passage. Surprisingly, self-renewal capacity of sphere-derived cells was similar/lower than other culture formats. We observed significant correlation between long-term-proliferating-cell symmetric division rates in sphere and adherent cultures, suggesting functional overlap between the compartments sustaining them. Experiments with normal primary human mammary epithelia, including sorted luminal (MUC1(+)) and basal/myoepithelial (CD10(+)) cells revealed distinct luminal-like, basal-like and mesenchymal entities amongst primary mammospheres. Morphological and colony-forming-cell assay data suggested mammosphere culture may enrich for a luminal progenitor phenotype, or induce reversion/relaxation of the basal/mesenchymal in vitro selection occurring with adherent culture. Overall, cell line tumourspheres and primary mammospheres are not homogenous entities enriched for stem cells, suggesting a more cautious approach to interpreting data from these assays and careful consideration of its limitations. Sphere culture may represent an alternative 3-dimensional culture system which rather than universally 'enriching' for stem cells, has utility as one of a suite of functional assays that provide a read-out of progenitor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1971212875,"To evaluate SAR as a dosimetric quantity for EMF bioeffects, and identify ways for increasing the precision in EMF dosimetry and bioactivity assessment.We discuss the interaction of man-made electromagnetic waves with biological matter and calculate the energy transferred to a single free ion within a cell. We analyze the physics and biology of SAR and evaluate the methods of its estimation. We discuss the experimentally observed non-linearity between electromagnetic exposure and biological effect.WE FIND THAT: a) The energy absorbed by living matter during exposure to environmentally accounted EMFs is normally well below the thermal level. b) All existing methods for SAR estimation, especially those based upon tissue conductivity and internal electric field, have serious deficiencies. c) The only method to estimate SAR without large error is by measuring temperature increases within biological tissue, which normally are negligible for environmental EMF intensities, and thus cannot be measured.SAR actually refers to thermal effects, while the vast majority of the recorded biological effects from man-made non-ionizing environmental radiation are non-thermal. Even if SAR could be accurately estimated for a whole tissue, organ, or body, the biological/health effect is determined by tiny amounts of energy/power absorbed by specific biomolecules, which cannot be calculated. Moreover, it depends upon field parameters not taken into account in SAR calculation. Thus, SAR should not be used as the primary dosimetric quantity, but used only as a complementary measure, always reporting the estimating method and the corresponding error. Radiation/field intensity along with additional physical parameters (such as frequency, modulation etc) which can be directly and in any case more accurately measured on the surface of biological tissues, should constitute the primary measure for EMF exposures, in spite of similar uncertainty to predict the biological effect due to non-linearity."
https://openalex.org/W2069383451,"Clinical, epidemiological, and genetic evidence suggest overlapping pathogenic mechanisms between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. We tested this hypothesis by asking if mutations in the ASD gene MECP2 which cause Rett syndrome affect the expression of genes encoding the schizophrenia risk factor dysbindin, a subunit of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1), and associated interacting proteins. We measured mRNA and protein levels of key components of a dysbindin interaction network by, quantitative real time PCR and quantitative immunohistochemistry in hippocampal samples of wild-type and Mecp2 mutant mice. In addition, we confirmed results by performing immunohistochemistry of normal human hippocampus and quantitative qRT-PCR of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived human neurons from Rett syndrome patients. We defined the distribution of the BLOC-1 subunit pallidin in human and mouse hippocampus and contrasted this distribution with that of symptomatic Mecp2 mutant mice. Neurons from mutant mice and Rett syndrome patients displayed selectively reduced levels of pallidin transcript. Pallidin immunoreactivity decreased in the hippocampus of symptomatic Mecp2 mutant mice, a feature most prominent at asymmetric synapses as determined by immunoelectron microcopy. Pallidin immunoreactivity decreased concomitantly with reduced BDNF content in the hippocampus of Mecp2 mice. Similarly, BDNF content was reduced in the hippocampus of BLOC-1 deficient mice suggesting that genetic defects in BLOC-1 are upstream of the BDNF phenotype in Mecp2 deficient mice. Our results demonstrate that the ASD-related gene Mecp2 regulates the expression of components belonging to the dysbindin interactome and these molecular differences may contribute to synaptic phenotypes that characterize Mecp2 deficiencies and ASD."

Genetic variation has been inferred to play a significant role in determining the susceptibility to this parasitic disease. To evaluate the genetic basis of Benedenia disease resistance in yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata), a genome-wide and chromosome-wide linkage analyses were initiated using F1 yellowtail families (n = 90 per family) based on a high-density linkage map with 860 microsatellite and 142 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Two major quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions on linkage groups Squ2 (BDR-1) and Squ20 (BDR-2) were identified. These QTL regions explained 32.9–35.5% of the phenotypic variance. On the other hand, we investigated the relationship between QTL for susceptibility to B. seriolae and QTL for fish body size. The QTL related to growth was found on another linkage group (Squ7). As a result, this is the first genetic evidence that contributes to detailing phenotypic resistance to Benedenia disease, and the results will help resolve the mechanism of resistance to this important parasitic infection of yellowtail."
https://openalex.org/W2051339872,"We analyse two models describing disease transmission and control on regular and small-world networks. We use simulations to find a control strategy that minimizes the total cost of an outbreak, thus balancing the costs of disease against that of the preventive treatment. The models are similar in their epidemiological part, but differ in how the removed/recovered individuals are treated. The differences in models affect choice of the strategy only for very cheap treatment and slow spreading disease. However for the combinations of parameters that are important from the epidemiological perspective (high infectiousness and expensive treatment) the models give similar results. Moreover, even where the choice of the strategy is different, the total cost spent on controlling the epidemic is very similar for both models."
https://openalex.org/W2084081940,"Dingoes (Canis lupus dingo) were introduced to Australia and became feral at least 4,000 years ago. We hypothesized that dingoes, being of domestic origin, would be adaptable to anthropogenic resource subsidies and that their space use would be affected by the dispersion of those resources. We tested this by analyzing Resource Selection Functions (RSFs) developed from GPS fixes (locations) of dingoes in arid central Australia. Using Generalized Linear Mixed-effect Models (GLMMs), we investigated resource relationships for dingoes that had access to abundant food near mine facilities, and for those that did not. From these models, we predicted the probability of dingo occurrence in relation to anthropogenic resource subsidies and other habitat characteristics over ∼ 18,000 km2. Very small standard errors and subsequent pervasively high P-values of results will become more important as the size of data sets, such as our GPS tracking logs, increases. Therefore, we also investigated methods to minimize the effects of serial and spatio-temporal correlation among samples and unbalanced study designs. Using GLMMs, we accounted for some of the correlation structure of GPS animal tracking data; however, parameter standard errors remained very small and all predictors were highly significant. Consequently, we developed an alternative approach that allowed us to review effect sizes at different spatial scales and determine which predictors were sufficiently ecologically meaningful to include in final RSF models. We determined that the most important predictor for dingo occurrence around mine sites was distance to the refuse facility. Away from mine sites, close proximity to human-provided watering points was predictive of dingo dispersion as were other landscape factors including palaeochannels, rocky rises and elevated drainage depressions. Our models demonstrate that anthropogenically supplemented food and water can alter dingo-resource relationships. The spatial distribution of such resources is therefore critical for the conservation and management of dingoes and other top predators."

Factors contributing to the short half-life of RNAP-rRNA promoter complexes include suboptimal discriminator sequences (the sequence preceding the transcriptional start point downstream of the −10 region (31.Travers A.A. Promoter sequence for stringent control of bacterial ribonucleic acid synthesis.J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 973-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), suboptimal −35 elements, and suboptimal spacing between the −10 and −35 hexamers (32.Travers A.A.

The destabilization of RNAP-rRNA promoter complexes by ppGpp/DksA observed in vitro might explain why ppGpp/DksA negatively affects transcriptional output from rrn promoters also in vivo (18.Haugen S.P. Ross W. Manrique M. Gourse R.L. Fine structure of the promoter-σ region 1.2 interaction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, all RNAP-promoter complexes studied in vitro, including promoters positively regulated by ppGpp/DksA, are destabilized by the addition of ppGpp/DksA (5.Paul B.J. Barker M.M. Ross W.

Balsalobre C. Regulation of the fimB promoter: a case of differential regulation by ppGpp and DksA in vivo.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 1223-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been difficult to explain positive control of transcription by ppGpp/DksA through changes in RNAP-promoter complex stability. Instead, it has been suggested that ppGpp/DksA fail to inhibit the output from promoters that make long-lived complexes because RNAP escapes to the elongation cycle before promoter occupancy declines (18.Haugen S.P. Ross W. Manrique M. Gourse R.L. Fine structure of the promoter-σ region 1.2 interaction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3292-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it was proposed that the positive effect of ppGpp/DksA on promoters induced during the stringent response is indirect and due to a presumed increase in free RNAP polymerase levels resulting from RNAP falling off promoters controlling the expression of rRNA (37.Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. Mechanism of regulation of transcription initiation by ppGpp. II. Models for positive control based on properties of RNAP mutants and competition for RNAP.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The argument of indirect control is based also on the premise that promoters positively regulated by ppGpp/DksA have an intrinsically low affinity for RNAP and require high concentration of RNAP for transcription (29.Barker M.M. Gaal T. Josaitis C.A. Gourse R.L. Mechanism of regulation of transcription initiation by ppGpp. I. Effects of ppGpp on transcription initiation in vivo and in vitro.J. Mol.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Whether RNAP concentrations actually increase during a stringent response and whether promoters positively regulated by ppGpp/DksA have, in general, a low affinity for RNAP is not known. Measurements have shown that the levels of free RNAP are elevated rather than reduced in cells lacking ppGpp (22.Gummesson B. Magnusson L.U. Lovmar M. Kvint K. Persson O. Ballesteros M. Farewell A. Nyström T. Increased RNA polymerase availability directs resources toward growth at the expense of maintenance.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 2209-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and calculations suggest that the free RNAP concentration rises with increasing growth rates, i.e. with decreasing levels of ppGpp (39.Bremer H. Dennis P. Ehrenberg M. Free RNA polymerase and modeling global transcription in Escherichia coli.Biochimie. 2003; 85: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Such results are difficult to reconcile with the notion that elevated ppGpp levels would cause an increase in the availability of free RNAP. The promoters of the usp genes, encoding the universal stress proteins UspA, -C, -D, -E, -F, and -G, are σ70-dependent and strongly regulated by ppGpp in a positive manner (40.Gustavsson N. Diez A. Nyström T. The universal stress protein paralogues of Escherichia coli are co-ordinately regulated and co-operate in the defence against DNA damage.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 41.Kvint K. Nachin L. Diez A. Nyström T. The bacterial universal stress protein: function and regulation.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In this work, using hybrid uspA promoters, we found that the 5-bp AT-rich discriminator region immediately downstream from the PuspA −10 element is required for positive control by ppGpp/DksA and that this region renders the promoter easily saturated by stabilizing the RNAP-promoter complex. Based on the saturation kinetics data presented, we suggest that the defining character of a promoter positively regulated by ppGpp/DksA is its relatively poor ability to clear out RNAP. ppGpp/DksA, by destabilizing the RNAP-promoter complex, allows RNAP to escape and embark on elongation. In contrast, we propose that the rate of transcription from promoters containing GC-rich discriminators downstream from their −10 element is not limited by the promoter interaction. Thus, a further destabilization by ppGpp/DksA will only have a negative effect on the transcriptional output of such promoters. The data are discussed in view of models for how RNAP availability affects transcriptional trade-offs. Bacterial strains are listed in supplemental Table SI. All promoter-lacZ constructs in this work were incorporated into bacteriophage λRS45 and integrated in the Escherichia coli chromosomal λ att site as described previously (42.Farewell A. Diez A.A.

Cultures were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks in M9 defined medium supplemented with a limiting concentration of glucose (0.08%), thiamine (10 μm), and all the amino acids in excess (44.Wanner B.L. Kodaira R. Neidhardt F.C. Physiological regulation of a decontrolled lac operon.J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 212-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 37 °C. When necessary, antibiotics were used in the following concentrations: carbenicillin 50 μg ml−1, chloramphenicol 30 μg ml−1, and kanamycin 50 μg ml−1. All promoter-lacZ transcriptional fusions were cloned into pTL61-T prior to integration into the E. coli chromosomal λ att site. Mutations within the uspA promoter were performed using Phusion® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Finnzymes). The UP-PuspA promoter was constructed such that the −60 to −39 part of the rrnB P1 promoter UP element (45.Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L.

A PCR-amplified portion of the uspA promoter region was subcloned into EcoRI and BamHI sites of the in vitro transcription plasmid pTE103 (46.Elliott T. Geiduschek E.P.

Wild type, ΔdksA, and the ΔrelA ΔspoT strains containing promoter-lacZ fusions were grown at 37 °C in M9 defined medium (see above). Samples for RNA extraction were taken in transition to stationary phase (A420 ∼2.5–3.5). Total RNA was isolated from cultures with RNeasy protect bacteria mini kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer's instructions with subsequent DNase digestion. RNA concentrations were measured using an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). First strand cDNAs were synthesized on 3.5 μg of total RNA using 150-ng random primers, 1× first strand buffer, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 200 units of SuperScriptTM III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). As control for genomic DNA contamination, a reaction with no reverse transcriptase was included. 1:100 of total synthesized cDNA were analyzed in triplicate by quantitative PCR using the iQ5 detection system (Bio-Rad). Negative controls were included in all runs; the cutoff was set at a Ct of 30 based on results with negative controls. Primer sequences for query gene and control gene are listed in supplemental Table SIII. All in vitro transcription reactions were performed as described (50.Ross W. Gourse R.L. Analysis of RNA polymerase-promoter complex formation.Methods. 2009; 47: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. All assays used supercoiled plasmid DNA as template. The transcript generated from the uspA− and rrnB P1− promoter derivatives were 347 and 220 nucleotides, respectively. E. coli RNA polymerase saturated with σ70 was obtained from Epicenter Biotech, and ppGpp was obtained from TriLink Biotech. His-DksA was purified as described above. Multiple-round reactions were performed at 37 °C by incubating 11 nm Eσ70 (RNA polymerase saturated with σ70) with 200 μm ppGpp and/or 5 μm DksA (or appropriate buffer) for 7 min prior to the addition of 1 nm supercoiled plasmid in a total volume of 25 μl in transcription buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 EDTA, and 0.10 mg ml−1 BSA. Transcription was initiated by adding a mixture of NTPs as follows: 0.2 mm final concentration each of ATP, GTP, and CTP; 0.01 mm final concentration of UTP, and 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (at >6000 Ci mmol−1; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was terminated after 15 min with 6× stop/loading buffer (150 mm EDTA, 1.05 m NaCl, 7 m urea, 10% glycerol, 0.0375% xylene cyanol, and 0.0375% bromphenol blue). For the rrnB P1 promoter and its derivatives, multiple-round reactions were performed as described by Haugen et al. (30.Haugen S.P. Berkmen M.B. Ross W. Gaal T. Ward C.

For the experiments described in Fig. 5, A and B, the indicated amounts of Eσ70 were preincubated with or without ppGpp and DksA prior to the addition of template DNA and NTPs as described above. Transcripts were separated by electrophoresis in 4% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. The gels were dried and exposed to image plates (Bio-Rad Imaging Screen K, Bio-Rad) and quantified using Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For single-round in vitro transcription used in open complex stability assays, 11 nm Eσ70 with 200 μm ppGpp and/or 5 μm DksA (or appropriate buffer) was preincubated for 7 min. To determine functional open complexes, preincubated mixtures were added to 1 nm supercoiled plasmid templates and incubated for an additional 10 min to allow open complex formation. Hepari"

Currently, there is no pharmaceutical treatment available for chronic stroke. We have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of the combination of stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (SCF+G-CSF) on chronic stroke. However, it remains unclear how SCF+G-CSF repairs the brain in chronic stroke. In this study, we determined the effects of SCF+G-CSF on neuronal network remodeling in the aged brain of chronic stroke. Cortical brain ischemia was produced in 16–18 month-old transgenic mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein in layer V pyramidal neurons. SCF+G-CSF was subcutaneously injected for 7 days beginning at 3.5 months post-ischemia. Using both live brain imaging and immunohistochemistry, we observed that SCF+G-CSF increased the mushroom-type spines on the apical dendrites of layer V pyramidal neurons adjacent to the infarct cavities 2 and 6 weeks after treatment. SCF+G-CSF also augmented dendritic branches and post-synaptic density protein 95 puncta in the peri-infarct cortex 6 weeks after treatment. These data suggest that SCF+G-CSF treatment in chronic stroke remodels neural circuits in the aged brain. This study provides evidence to support the development of a new therapeutic strategy for chronic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W1971030620,"MicroRNA (miR) abnormalities play a key role in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). High levels of miR-155 have been detected in human neoplasms, and overexpression of miR-155 has been found to induce lymphoma in mice. High levels of miR-155 were detected in CLL cells and STAT3, which is known to induce miR-21 and miR-181b-1 expression, is constitutively activated in CLL. Given these findings, we hypothesized that STAT3 induces miR-155. Sequence analysis revealed that the miR-155 promoter harbors two putative STAT3 binding sites. Therefore, truncated miR-155 promoter constructs and STAT3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) were co-transfected into MM1 cells. Of the two putative binding sites, STAT3-siRNA reduced the luciferase activity of the construct containing the 700–709 bp STAT3 binding site, suggesting that this site is involved in STAT3-induced transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that STAT3 bound to the miR-155 promoter in CLL cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assay confirmed that STAT3 bound to the 700–709 bp but not the 615–624 bp putative STAT3 binding site in CLL cells. Finally, STAT3-small hairpin RNA downregulated miR-155 gene expression, suggesting that constitutively activated STAT3 binds to the miR-155 gene promoter. Together, these results suggest that STAT3 activates miR-155 in CLL cells."
https://openalex.org/W2068272494,"All non-human great apes are endangered in the wild, and it is therefore important to gain an understanding of their demography and genetic diversity. Whole genome assembly projects have provided an invaluable foundation for understanding genetics in all four genera, but to date genetic studies of multiple individuals within great ape species have largely been confined to mitochondrial DNA and a small number of other loci. Here, we present a genome-wide survey of genetic variation in gorillas using a reduced representation sequencing approach, focusing on the two lowland subspecies. We identify 3,006,670 polymorphic sites in 14 individuals: 12 western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and 2 eastern lowland gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri). We find that the two species are genetically distinct, based on levels of heterozygosity and patterns of allele sharing. Focusing on the western lowland population, we observe evidence for population substructure, and a deficit of rare genetic variants suggesting a recent episode of population contraction. In western lowland gorillas, there is an elevation of variation towards telomeres and centromeres on the chromosomal scale. On a finer scale, we find substantial variation in genetic diversity, including a marked reduction close to the major histocompatibility locus, perhaps indicative of recent strong selection there. These findings suggest that despite their maintaining an overall level of genetic diversity equal to or greater than that of humans, population decline, perhaps associated with disease, has been a significant factor in recent and long-term pressures on wild gorilla populations."

To better understand the amyloid formation pathway of SAA, we characterized the oligomerization, misfolding, and aggregation of a disease-associated isoform of human SAA – human SAA1.1 (hSAA1.1) – using techniques ranging from circular dichroism spectroscopy to atomic force microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, immunoblot studies, solubility measurements, and seeding experiments. We found that hSAA1.1 formed alpha helix-rich, marginally stable oligomers in vitro on refolding and cross-beta-rich aggregates following incubation at 37°C. Strikingly, while hSAA1.1 was not highly amyloidogenic in vitro, the addition of a single N-terminal methionine residue significantly enhanced the fibrillation propensity of hSAA1.1 and modulated its fibrillation pathway. A deeper understanding of the oligomerization and fibrillation pathway of hSAA1.1 may help elucidate its pathological role."
https://openalex.org/W1995068072,"Background Restoration is increasingly implemented to reestablish habitat structure and function following physical anthropogenic disturbance, but scientific knowledge of effectiveness of methods lags behind demand for guidelines. On coral reefs, recovery is largely dependent on coral reestablishment, and substratum stability is critical to the survival of coral fragments and recruits. Concrete is often used to immobilize rubble, but its ecological performance has not been rigorously evaluated, and restoration has generally fallen short of returning degraded habitat to pre-disturbance conditions. Fragments of erect branching sponges mediate reef recovery by facilitating rubble consolidation, yet such natural processes have been largely overlooked in restoring reefs. Methods On two reefs in Curacao, four treatments - coral rubble alone, rubble seeded with sponge fragments, rubble bound by concrete, and concrete “rubble” bound by concrete - were monitored over four years to investigate rubble consolidation with and without sponges and the ecological performance of treatments in terms of the number and diversity of coral recruits. Species specific rates of sponge fragment attachment to rubble, donor sponge growth and tissue replacement, and fragment survival inside rubble piles were also investigated to evaluate sponge species performance and determine rates for sustainably harvesting tissue. Findings/Significance Rubble piles seeded with sponges retained height and shape to a significantly greater degree, lost fewer replicates to water motion, and were significantly more likely to be consolidated over time than rubble alone. Significantly more corals recruited to sponge-seeded rubble than to all other treatments. Coral diversity was also greatest for rubble with sponges and it was the only treatment to which framework building corals recruited. Differences in overall sponge species performance suggest species selection is important to consider. Employing organisms that jump start successional pathways and facilitate recovery can significantly improve restoration outcomes; however, best practices require techniques be tailored to each system."

https://openalex.org/W2130779404,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related condition characterized by accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid β peptides (Aβ) in brain and retina. Because bone marrow transplantation (BMT) results in decreased cerebral Aβ in experimental AD, we hypothesized that BMT would mitigate retinal neurotoxicity through decreased retinal Aβ. To test this, we performed BMT in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 double transgenic mice using green fluorescent protein expressing wild type (wt) mice as marrow donors. We first examined retinas from control, non-transplanted, aged AD mice and found a two-fold increase in microglia compared with wt mice, prominent inner retinal Aβ and paired helical filament-tau, and decreased retinal ganglion cell layer neurons. BMT resulted in near complete replacement of host retinal microglia with BMT-derived cells and normalized total AD retinal microglia to non-transplanted wt levels. Aβ and paired helical filament-tau were reduced (61.0% and 44.1% respectively) in BMT-recipient AD mice, which had 20.8% more retinal ganglion cell layer neurons than non-transplanted AD controls. Interestingly, aged wt BMT recipients also had significantly more neurons (25.4%) compared with non-transplanted aged wt controls. Quantitation of retinal ganglion cell layer neurons in young mice confirmed age-related retinal degeneration was mitigated by BMT. We found increased MHC class II expression in BMT-derived microglia and decreased oxidative damage in retinal ganglion cell layer neurons. Thus, BMT is neuroprotective in age-related as well as AD-related retinal degeneration, and may be a result of alterations in innate immune function and oxidative stress in BMT recipient mice."
https://openalex.org/W2060863630,"Background Using comparative glycoproteomics, we have previously identified a glycoprotein that is altered in both amount and glycosylation as a function of liver cirrhosis. The altered glycoprotein is an agalactosylated (G0) immunoglobulin G molecule (IgG) that recognizes the heterophilic alpha-gal epitope. Since the alpha gal epitope is found on gut enterobacteria, it has been hypothesized that anti-gal antibodies are generated as a result of increased bacterial exposure in patients with liver disease. Methods The N-linked glycosylation of anti-gal IgG molecules from patients with fibrosis and cirrhosis was determined and the effector function of anti-bacterial antibodies from over 100 patients examined. In addition, markers of microbial exposure were determined. Results Surprisingly, the subset of agalactosylated anti-gal antibodies described here, was impaired in their ability to mediate complement mediated lysis and inhibited the complement-mediated destruction of common gut bacteria. In an analysis of serum from more than 100 patients with liver disease, we have shown that those with increased levels of this modified anti-gal antibody had increased levels of markers of bacterial exposure. Conclusions Anti-gal antibodies in patients with liver cirrhosis were reduced in their ability to mediate complement mediated lysis of target cells. As bacterial infection is a major complication in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial products such as LPS are thought to play a major role in the development and progression of liver fibrosis, this finding has many clinical implications in the etiology, prognosis and treatment of liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2104157399,"Islet 1 (Isl1) is a transcription factor of the LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) protein family and is essential for many developmental processes. LIM-HD proteins all contain two protein-interacting LIM domains, a DNA-binding homeodomain (HD), and a C-terminal region. In Isl1, the C-terminal region also contains the LIM homeobox 3 (Lhx3)-binding domain (LBD), which interacts with the LIM domains of Lhx3. The LIM domains of Isl1 have been implicated in inhibition of DNA binding potentially through an intramolecular interaction with or close to the HD. Here we investigate the LBD as a candidate intramolecular interaction domain. Competitive yeast-two hybrid experiments indicate that the LIM domains and LBD from Isl1 can interact with apparently low affinity, consistent with no detection of an intermolecular interaction in the same system. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies show that the interaction is specific, whereas substitution of the LBD with peptides of the same amino acid composition but different sequence is not specific. We solved the crystal structure of a similar but higher affinity complex between the LIM domains of Isl1 and the LIM interaction domain from the LIM-HD cofactor protein LIM domain-binding protein 1 (Ldb1) and used these coordinates to generate a homology model of the intramolecular interaction that indicates poorer complementarity for the weak intramolecular interaction. The intramolecular interaction in Isl1 may provide protection against aggregation, minimize unproductive DNA binding, and facilitate cofactor exchange within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1984718084,"Modern biology research requires simple techniques for efficient and restriction site-independent modification of genetic material. Classical cloning and mutagenesis strategies are limited by their dependency on restriction sites and the use of complementary primer pairs. Here, we describe the Single Oligonucleotide Mutagenesis and Cloning Approach (SOMA) that is independent of restriction sites and only requires a single mutagenic oligonucleotide to modify a plasmid. We demonstrate the broad application spectrum of SOMA with three examples. First, we present a novel plasmid that in a standardized and rapid fashion can be used as a template for SOMA to generate GFP-reporters. We successfully use such a reporter to assess the in vivo knock-down quality of morpholinos in Xenopus laevis embryos. In a second example, we show how to use a SOMA-based protocol for restriction-site independent cloning to generate chimeric proteins by domain swapping between the two human hRMD5a and hRMD5b isoforms. Last, we show that SOMA simplifies the generation of randomized single-site mutagenized gene libraries. As an example we random-mutagenize a single codon affecting the catalytic activity of the yeast Ssy5 endoprotease and identify a spectrum of tolerated and non-tolerated substitutions. Thus, SOMA represents a highly efficient alternative to classical cloning and mutagenesis strategies."

To assess the clinical utility of CSD, relationships between stone-free (SF) status and stone burden (CSD and volume) were analyzed using the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve. To identify stone number impact on CSD, the AUROC of CSD divided by stone number was evaluated. Correlation coefficients of CSD and stone volume were also calculated for groups by stone number.In cases with CSD <20.0 mm, CSD and stone volume revealed equal ability to predict SF status. In cases with CSD ≥20.0 mm, stone volume showed higher predictive ability. The ROC curves for cases with ≥4 stones showed that CSD was less predictive of SF status than stone volume. The correlation coefficients of CSD and stone volume by stone number were 0.922 for 1 stone, 0.900 for 2-3 stones, and 0.661 for ≥4 stones.In cases with CSD ≥20.0 mm or ≥4 stones, we should evaluate stone volume for a more predictive stone burden, and pretreatment non-contrast CT seems sufficient. In cases with CSD <20.0 mm or 1-3 stones, CSD was as valid a predictor of preoperative stone burden as stone volume, so preoperative kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) films may be sufficient."
https://openalex.org/W1974446523,"The first described, environmentally isolated, Bordetella petrii was shown to undergo massive genomic rearrangements in vitro. More recently, B. petrii was isolated from clinical samples associated with jaw, ear bone, cystic fibrosis and chronic pulmonary disease. However, the in vivo consequences of B. petrii genome plasticity and its pathogenicity remain obscure. B. petrii was identified from four sequential respiratory samples and a post-mortem spleen sample of a woman presenting with bronchiectasis and cavitary lung disease associated with nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. Strains were compared genetically, phenotypically and by antibody recognition from the patient and from inoculated mice. The successive B. petrii strains exhibited differences in growth, antibiotic susceptibility and recognition by the patient’s antibodies. Antibodies from mice inoculated with these strains recapitulated the specificity and strain dependent response that was seen with the patient’s serum. Finally, we characterize one strain that was poorly recognized by the patient’s antibodies, due to a defect in the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen, and identify a mutation associated with this phenotype. We propose that B. petrii is remarkably adaptable in vivo, providing a possible connection between immune response and bacterial evasion and supporting infection persistence."
https://openalex.org/W1970943269,"The genus Calotriton includes two species of newts highly adapted to live in cold and fast-flowing mountain springs. The Pyrenean brook newt (Calotriton asper), restricted to the Pyrenean region, and the Montseny brook newt (Calotriton arnoldi), endemic to the Montseny massif and one of the most endangered amphibian species in Europe. In the present manuscript, we use an integrative approach including species distribution modeling (SDM), molecular analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data and morphology to unravel the historical processes that have contributed to shaping the biogeography and genetic structure of the genus Calotriton, with special emphasis on the conservation of C. arnoldi. The results of the molecular analyses confirm that, despite having originated recently, being ecologically similar and geographically very close, there is no signal of hybridization between C. asper and C. arnoldi. SDM results suggest that tough environmental conditions on mountains tops during glacial periods, together with subsequent warmer periods could have prevented the contact between the two species. Within the critically endangered C. arnoldi, a high genetic structure is revealed despite its extremely small distribution range compared to C. asper. Haplotype networks, AMOVA and SAMOVA analyses suggest that two distinct groups of populations can be clearly differentiated with absence of gene flow. This is in concordance with morphological differentiation and correlates with its geographical distribution, as the two groups are situated on the eastern and western sides of a river valley that acts as a barrier. The genetic and morphological results are highly important for the ongoing conservation program of C. arnoldi and strongly justify the management of this species into at least two independent evolutionary significant units (eastern and western sectors) to guarantee the long-term population viability."
https://openalex.org/W2030637538,"In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, oxidoreductases of the thioredoxin superfamily contribute to bacterial invasiveness, intracellular replication and to the virulence in BALB/c mice as well as in the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The scsABCD gene cluster, present in many but not all enteric bacteria, codes for four putative oxidoreductases of the thioredoxin superfamily. Here we have analyzed the potential role of the scs genes in oxidative stress tolerance and virulence in S. Typhimurium. An scsABCD deletion mutant showed moderate sensitization to the redox-active transition metal ion copper and increased protein carbonylation upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Still, the scsABCD mutant was not significantly affected for invasiveness or intracellular replication in respectively cultured epithelial or macrophage-like cells. However, we noted a significant copper chloride sensitivity of SPI1 T3SS mediated invasiveness that strongly depended on the presence of the scs genes. The scsABCD deletion mutant was not attenuated in animal infection models. In contrast, the mutant showed a moderate increase in its competitive index upon intraperitoneal challenge and enhanced invasiveness in small intestinal ileal loops of BALB/c mice. Moreover, deletion of the scsABCD genes restored the invasiveness of a trxA mutant in epithelial cells and its virulence in C. elegans. Our findings thus demonstrate that the scs gene cluster conditionally affects virulence and underscore the complex interactions between oxidoreductases of the thioredoxin superfamily in maintaining host adaptation of S. Typhimurium."
https://openalex.org/W2038189978,"Data from clinical studies and results from animal models suggest an involvement of the neurotrophin system in the pathology of depression and antidepressant treatment response. Genetic variations within the genes coding for the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its key receptor Trkb (NTRK2) may therefore influence the response to antidepressant treatment.We performed a single and multi-marker association study with antidepressant treatment outcome in 398 depressed Caucasian inpatients participating in the Munich Antidepressant Response Signature (MARS) project. Two Caucasian replication samples (N = 249 and N = 247) were investigated, resulting in a total number of 894 patients. 18 tagging SNPs in the BDNF gene region and 64 tagging SNPs in the NTRK2 gene region were genotyped in the discovery sample; 16 nominally associated SNPs were tested in two replication samples.In the discovery analysis, 7 BDNF SNPs and 9 NTRK2 SNPs were nominally associated with treatment response. Three NTRK2 SNPs (rs10868223, rs1659412 and rs11140778) also showed associations in at least one replication sample and in the combined sample with the same direction of effects (Pcorr = .018, Pcorr = .015 and Pcorr = .004, respectively). We observed an across-gene BDNF-NTRK2 SNP interaction for rs4923468 and rs1387926. No robust interaction of associated SNPs was found in an analysis of BDNF serum protein levels as a predictor for treatment outcome in a subset of 93 patients.Although not all associations in the discovery analysis could be unambiguously replicated, the findings of the present study identified single nucleotide variations in the BDNF and NTRK2 genes that might be involved in antidepressant treatment outcome and that have not been previously reported in this context. These new variants need further validation in future association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2142301966,"On-call duty among medical interns is characterized by sleep deprivation and stressful working conditions, both of which alter cardiac autonomic modulation. We hypothesized that sleep stability decreased in medical interns during on-call duty. We used cardiopulmonary-coupling (CPC) analysis to test our hypothesis.We used electrocardiogram (ECG)-based CPC analysis to quantify physiological parameters of sleep stability in 13 medical interns during on-call and on-call duty-free periods. There were ten 33.5-h on-call duty shifts per month for interns, each followed by 2 on-call duty-free days, over 3 months. Measurements during sleep were collected before, during, and after an on-call shift. Measurements were repeated 3 months later during an on-call duty-free period.The medical interns had significantly reduced stable sleep, and displayed increased latency to the first epoch of stable sleep during the on-call night shift, compared to the pre-call and on-call duty-free nights. Interns also had significantly increased rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep during the on-call night shift, compared to the pre-call and on-call duty-free nights.Medical interns suffer disrupted sleep stability and continuity during on-call night shifts. The ECG-based CPC analysis provides a straightforward means to quantify sleep quality and stability in medical staff performing shift work under stressful conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1979513736,"Fierce predatory freshwater fishes, the species of Percocypris (Cyprinidae, Teleostei) inhabit large rivers or lakes, and have a specific distribution pattern. Only a single species or subspecies occurs in each large-scale drainage basin of the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau. In this study, the molecular phylogenetic relationships for all but one of the described subspecies/species of Percocypris were investigated based on three mitochondrial genes (16S; COI; Cyt b) and one nuclear marker (Rag2). The results of Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses show that Percocypris is a strongly supported monophyletic group and that it is the sister group of Schizothorax. Combined with analyses of morphological characters, our results suggest that Percocypris needs to be reclassified, and we propose that six species be recognized, with corresponding distributions in five main drainages (including one lake). In addition, based on the results of the estimation of divergence times and ancestral drainages, we hypothesize that Percocypris likely originated in the early Miocene from a paleo-connected drainage system containing the contemporary main drainages of the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau. This study suggests that vicariance (due to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau modifying the large-scale morphologies of drainage basins in the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau) has played an important role in the speciation of the genus. Furthermore, external morphological characters (such as the length of the fins) and an internal trait (the position of pterygiophore) appear to be correlated with different habitats in rivers and the lake."
https://openalex.org/W2070409299,"Oxidative stress is considered to be a major factor contributing to pathogenesis and progression of many diseases. A novel andrographolide-lipoic acid conjugate (AL-1) could protect pancreatic β-cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative injury. However, its protective mechanism is still unclear. In this work, we used proteomics to identify AL-1-regulated proteins in β-cells and found that 13 of the 71 proteins regulated by AL-1 were closely associated with antioxidation. These differential proteins were mainly involved in the ERK1/2 and AKT1 signaling pathways. Functional investigation demonstrated that AL-1 exerted its protective effects on H2O2-induced cell death of β-cells by generating NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS to activate ERK1/2 and AKT1 signaling pathways. As a consequence, the expressions of antioxidant proteins including Trx1, Prx1 and Prx5, and anti-apoptotic proteins including PDCD6IP, prohibitin, galectin-1 and HSP were upregulated. AL-1 probably worked as a ""vaccinum"" to activate the cellular antioxidant system by inducing the generation of low concentration ROS which then reciprocally protected β-cells from oxidative damage caused by high-level ROS from H2O2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive proteomic analysis illustrating a novel molecular mechanism for the protective effects of antioxidants on β-cells from H2O2-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2052132819,"Identification of CD8+ T cell epitopes that can induce T cells to kill tumor cells is a fundamental step for development of a peptide cancer vaccine. POTE protein is a newly identified cancer antigen that was found to be expressed in a wide variety of human cancers, including prostate, colon, lung, breast, ovary and pancreas. Here, we determined HLA-A2.1-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes in the POTE protein, and also designed enhanced epitopes by amino acid (AA) substitutions. Five 9-mer peptides were first selected and their binding affinity to HLA-A2 molecules was measured by the T2 binding assay. POTE 272–280 and POTE 323–331 showed the strongest HLA-A2 binding affinity. AA substituted peptides POTE 252-9V (with valine at position 9), POTE 553-1Y (with tyrosine at position 1) and POTE 323-3F (with phenylalanine at position 3) conferred higher affinity for HLA-A2, and induced CTL responses cross-reactive with wild type antigens. While POTE 252-9V was the strongest in this respect, POTE 323-3F had the greatest increase in immunogenicity compared to wild type. Importantly, two modified epitopes (POTE-553-1Y and POTE-323-3F) induced CTLs that killed NCI-H522, a POTE-expressing HLA-A2+ human non-small cell lung cancer cell line, indicating natural endogenous processing of these epitopes. In conclusion, the immunogenicity of POTE epitopes can be enhanced by peptide modification to induce T cells that kill human cancer cells. A combination of POTE 553-1Y and POTE 323-3F epitopes might be an attractive vaccine strategy for HLA-A2 cancer patients to overcome tolerance induced by tumors and prevent escape."
https://openalex.org/W2028093358,"The joint venture of many members is common both in animal world and human society. In these public enterprizes, highly cooperative groups are more likely to while low cooperative groups are still possible but not probable to succeed. Existent literature mostly focuses on the traditional public goods game, in which cooperators create public wealth unconditionally and benefit all group members unbiasedly. We here institute a model addressing this public goods dilemma with incorporating the public resource foraging failure risk. Risk-averse individuals tend to lead a autarkic life, while risk-preferential ones tend to participate in the risky public goods game. For participants, group's success relies on its cooperativeness, with increasing contribution leading to increasing success likelihood. We introduce a function with one tunable parameter to describe the risk removal pattern and study in detail three representative classes. Analytical results show that the widely replicated population dynamics of cyclical dominance of loner, cooperator and defector disappear, while most of the time loners act as savors while eventually they also disappear. Depending on the way that group's success relies on its cooperativeness, either cooperators pervade the entire population or they coexist with defectors. Even in the later case, cooperators still hold salient superiority in number as some defectors also survive by parasitizing. The harder the joint venture succeeds, the higher level of cooperation once cooperators can win the evolutionary race. Our work may enrich the literature concerning the risky public goods games."
https://openalex.org/W2075082694,"Leucine rich repeat transmembrane protein 3 (LRRTM3) is member of a synaptic protein family. LRRTM3 is a nested gene within α-T catenin (CTNNA3) and resides at the linkage peak for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) risk and plasma amyloid β (Aβ) levels. In-vitro knock-down of LRRTM3 was previously shown to decrease secreted Aβ, although the mechanism of this is unclear. In SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing APP and transiently transfected with LRRTM3 alone or with BACE1, we showed that LRRTM3 co-localizes with both APP and BACE1 in early endosomes, where BACE1 processing of APP occurs. Additionally, LRRTM3 co-localizes with APP in primary neuronal cultures from Tg2576 mice transduced with LRRTM3-expressing adeno-associated virus. Moreover, LRRTM3 co-immunoprecipitates with both endogenous APP and overexpressed BACE1, in HEK293T cells transfected with LRRTM3. SH-SY5Y cells with knock-down of LRRTM3 had lower BACE1 and higher CTNNA3 mRNA levels, but no change in APP. Brain mRNA levels of LRRTM3 showed significant correlations with BACE1, CTNNA3 and APP in ∼400 humans, but not in LRRTM3 knock-out mice. Finally, we assessed 69 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and flanking LRRTM3 in 1,567 LOADs and 2,082 controls and identified 8 SNPs within a linkage disequilibrium block encompassing 5′UTR-Intron 1 of LRRTM3 that formed multilocus genotypes (MLG) with suggestive global association with LOAD risk (p = 0.06), and significant individual MLGs. These 8 SNPs were genotyped in an independent series (1,258 LOADs and 718 controls) and had significant global and individual MLG associations in the combined dataset (p = 0.02–0.05). Collectively, these results suggest that protein interactions between LRRTM3, APP and BACE1, as well as complex associations between mRNA levels of LRRTM3, CTNNA3, APP and BACE1 in humans might influence APP metabolism and ultimately risk of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2094285257,"Avian influenza viruses pose a serious pandemic threat to humans. Better knowledge on cross-species adaptation is important. This study examined the replication and transcription efficiency of ribonucleoprotein complexes reconstituted by plasmid co-transfection between H5N1, H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 influenza A viruses, and to identify mutations in the RNA polymerase subunit that affect human adaptation. Viral RNA polymerase subunits PB1, PB2, PA and NP derived from influenza viruses were co-expressed with pPolI-vNP-Luc in human cells, and with its function evaluated by luciferase reporter assay. A quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA levels for assessing the replication and transcription efficiency. Mutations in polymerase subunit were created to identify signature of increased human adaptability. H5N1 ribonucleoprotein complexes incorporated with PB2 derived from H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 viruses increased the polymerase activity in human cells. Furthermore, single amino acid substitutions at PB2 of H5N1 could affect polymerase activity in a temperature-dependent manner. By using a highly sensitive quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, an obvious enhancement in replication and transcription activities of ribonucleoproteins was observed by the introduction of lysine at residue 627 in the H5N1 PB2 subunit. Although less strongly in polymerase activity, E158G mutation appeared to alter the accumulation of H5N1 RNA levels in a temperature-dependent manner, suggesting a temperature-dependent mechanism in regulating transcription and replication exists. H5N1 viruses can adapt to humans either by acquisition of PB2 from circulating human-adapted viruses through reassortment, or by mutations at critical sites in PB2. This information may help to predict the pandemic potential of newly emerged influenza strains, and provide a scientific basis for stepping up surveillance measures and vaccine production."
https://openalex.org/W2026753606,"Alus are the most abundant and successful short interspersed nuclear elements found in primate genomes. In humans, they represent about 10% of the genome, although few are retrotransposition-competent and are clustered into subfamilies according to the source gene from which they evolved. Recombination between them can lead to genomic rearrangements of clinical and evolutionary significance. In this study, we have addressed the role of recombination in the origin of chimeric Alu source genes by the analysis of all known consensus sequences of human Alus. From the allelic diversity of Alu consensus sequences, validated in extant elements resulting from whole genome searches, distinct events of recombination were detected in the origin of particular subfamilies of AluS and AluY source genes. These results demonstrate that at least two subfamilies are likely to have emerged from ectopic Alu-Alu recombination, which stimulates further research regarding the potential of chimeric active Alus to punctuate the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2037109356,"Background Oral cancer requires considerable utilization of healthcare services. Wide resection of the tumor and reconstruction with free flap are widely used. Due to high recurrence rate, close follow-up is mandatory. This study was conducted to explore the relationship between the healthcare expenditure of oncological surgery and one-year follow up and provider volume. Methods From the National Health Insurance Research Database published by the Taiwanese National Health Research Institute, the authors selected a total of 1300 oral cancer patients who underwent tumor resection and free flap reconstruction in 2008. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was subsequently performed to explore the relationship between provider volume and expenditures of oncological surgery and one-year follow-up period. Emergency department (ED) visits and 30-day readmission rates were also analyzed. Results The mean expenditure for oncological surgery was $11080±4645 (all costs are given in U.S. dollars) and $10129±9248 for one-year follow up. For oncological surgery expenditure, oral cancer patients treated by low-volume surgeons had an additional $845 than those in high-volume surgeons in mixed model. For one-year follow-up expenditure, patients in low-volume hospitals had an additional $3439 than those in high-volume hospitals; patient in low-volume surgeons and medium-volume surgeons incurred an additional expenditure of $2065 and $1811 than those in high-volume surgeons. Oral cancer patients treated in low-volume hospitals incurred higher risk of 30-day readmission rate (odds ratio, 6.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.6–27). Conclusions After adjusting for physician, hospital, and patient characteristics, low-volume provider performing wide excision with reconstructive surgery in oral cancer patients incurred significantly higher expenditure for oncological surgery and one-year healthcare per patient than did others with higher volumes. Treatment strategies adapted by high-volume providers should be further analyzed."

https://openalex.org/W2093385417,"A classification image (CI) technique has shown that static luminance noise near visually completed contours affects the discrimination of fat and thin Kanizsa shapes. These influential noise regions were proposed to reveal ""behavioral receptive fields"" of completed contours-the same regions to which early cortical cells respond in neurophysiological studies of contour completion. Here, we hypothesized that 1) influential noise regions correspond to the surfaces that distinguish fat and thin shapes (hereafter, key regions); and 2) key region noise biases a ""fat"" response to the extent that its contrast polarity (lighter or darker than background) matches the shape's filled-in surface color.To test our hypothesis, we had observers discriminate fat and thin noise-embedded rectangles that were defined by either illusory or luminance-defined contours (Experiment 1). Surrounding elements (""inducers"") caused the shapes to appear either lighter or darker than the background-a process sometimes referred to as lightness induction. For both illusory and luminance-defined rectangles, key region noise biased a fat response to the extent that its contrast polarity (light or dark) matched the induced surface color. When lightness induction was minimized, luminance noise had no consistent influence on shape discrimination. This pattern arose when pixels immediately adjacent to the discriminated boundaries were excluded from the analysis (Experiment 2) and also when the noise was restricted to the key regions so that the noise never overlapped with the physically visible edges (Experiment 3). The lightness effects did not occur in the absence of enclosing boundaries (Experiment 4).Under noisy conditions, lightness induction alters visually completed shape. Moreover, behavioral receptive fields derived in CI studies do not correspond to contours per se but to filled-in surface regions contained by those contours. The relevance of lightness to two-dimensional shape completion supplies a new constraint for models of object perception."
https://openalex.org/W2084504168,"The discovery of effective new antimalarial agents is urgently needed. One of the most frequently studied molecules anchored to the parasite surface is the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1). At red blood cell invasion MSP1 is proteolytically processed, and the 19-kDa C-terminal fragment (MSP119) remains on the surface and is taken into the red blood cell, where it is transferred to the food vacuole and persists until the end of the intracellular cycle. Because a number of specific antibodies inhibit erythrocyte invasion and parasite growth, MSP119 is therefore a promising target against malaria. Given the structural homology of cupredoxins with the Fab domain of monoclonal antibodies, an approach combining NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements with docking calculations based on BiGGER is employed on MSP119-cupredoxin complexes. Among the cupredoxins tested, rusticyanin forms a well defined complex with MSP119 at a site that overlaps with the surface recognized by the inhibitory antibodies. The addition of holo-rusticyanin to infected cells results in parasitemia inhibition, but negligible effects on parasite growth can be observed for apo-rusticyanin and other proteins of the cupredoxin family. These findings point to rusticyanin as an excellent therapeutic tool for malaria treatment and provide valuable information for drug design."
https://openalex.org/W1979398176,"Background Global tuberculosis (TB) control is encumbered by the lack of a rapid and simple detection method for diagnosis, especially in low-resource areas. An isothermal amplification method, hyperbranched rolling circle amplification (HRCA), was optimized to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in clinical sputum specimens. Methods A clinical validation study was performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of HRCA. In order to analyze the detection limit of HRCA under optimal conditions, the method was initially used to detect purified H37Rv strain DNA and culture suspensions. Next, three strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) and eight strains of non-tuberculosis mycobacterium (NTM) were analyzed in order to evaluate specificity. Sputum specimens from 136 patients with diagnosed pulmonary TB, 38 lung cancer patients, and 34 healthy donors were tested by HRCA to validate the clinical application of HRCA for the rapid detection of Mtb. Results The detection limit of HRCA for purified H37Rv DNA and culture suspensions was 740 aM and 200cfu/ml, respectively. The results of all MTC strains were positive in contrast to the NTM specimens which were all negative. The detection sensitivity for the 136 sputum specimens from TB patients was 77.2% (105/136), which was slightly lower than that of quantitative real-time PCR(79.4%, 108/136) and culture (80.9%,110/136). The sensitivity of all three methods was statistically higher than smear microscopy (44.9%, 61/136). The overall specificity of HRCA was 98.6% (71/72) which was similar to that of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and smear/culture methods (100%, 72/72). Conclusions Use of the HRCA assay for detection of Mtb within clinical sputum specimens was demonstrated to be highly sensitive and specific. Moreover, the performance of HRCA is simple and cost-effective compared with qRT-PCR and is less time consuming than culture. Therefore, HRCA is a promising TB diagnostic tool that can be used routinely in low-resource clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2134037739,"Nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the greenhouse gases that can contribute to global warming. Spatial variability of N2O can lead to large uncertainties in prediction. However, previous studies have often ignored the spatial dependency to quantify the N2O - environmental factors relationships. Few researches have examined the impacts of various spatial correlation structures (e.g. independence, distance-based and neighbourhood based) on spatial prediction of N2O emissions. This study aimed to assess the impact of three spatial correlation structures on spatial predictions and calibrate the spatial prediction using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) based on replicated, irregular point-referenced data. The data were measured in 17 chambers randomly placed across a 271 m(2) field between October 2007 and September 2008 in the southeast of Australia. We used a Bayesian geostatistical model and a Bayesian spatial conditional autoregressive (CAR) model to investigate and accommodate spatial dependency, and to estimate the effects of environmental variables on N2O emissions across the study site. We compared these with a Bayesian regression model with independent errors. The three approaches resulted in different derived maps of spatial prediction of N2O emissions. We found that incorporating spatial dependency in the model not only substantially improved predictions of N2O emission from soil, but also better quantified uncertainties of soil parameters in the study. The hybrid model structure obtained by BMA improved the accuracy of spatial prediction of N2O emissions across this study region."
https://openalex.org/W2088378403,"In this work, we used a combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methodologies to acquire structural information on pH-induced unfolding of the maltotriose-binding protein from Thermus thermophilus (MalE2). FCS has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing the dynamics of molecules and it is, in fact, used to study molecular diffusion on timescale of microsecond and longer. Our results showed that keeping temperature constant, the protein diffusion coefficient decreased from 84±4 µm2/s to 44±3 µm2/s when pH was changed from 7.0 to 4.0. An even more marked decrease of the MalE2 diffusion coefficient (31±3 µm2/s) was registered when pH was raised from 7.0 to 10.0. According to the size of MalE2 (a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 43 kDa) as well as of its globular native shape, the values of 44 µm2/s and 31 µm2/s could be ascribed to deformations of the protein structure, which enhances its propensity to form aggregates at extreme pH values. The obtained fluorescence correlation data, corroborated by circular dichroism, fluorescence emission and light-scattering experiments, are discussed together with the MD simulations results."
