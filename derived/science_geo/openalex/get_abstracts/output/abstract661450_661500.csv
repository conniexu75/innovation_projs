https://openalex.org/W3092832410,"Masks are an effective tool in combatting the spread of COVID-19, but some people still resist wearing them and mask-wearing behavior has not been experimentally studied in the United States. To understand the demographics of mask wearers and resistors, and the impact of mandates on mask-wearing behavior, we observed shoppers (n = 9935) entering retail stores during periods of June, July, and August 2020. Approximately 41% of the June sample wore a mask. At that time, the odds of an individual wearing a mask increased significantly with age and was also 1.5x greater for females than males. Additionally, the odds of observing a mask on an urban or suburban shopper were ~4x that for rural areas. Mask mandates enacted in late July and August increased mask-wearing compliance to over 90% in all groups, but a small percentage of resistors remained. Thus, gender, age, and location factor into whether shoppers in the United States wear a mask or face covering voluntarily. Additionally, mask mandates are necessary to increase mask wearing among the public to a level required to mitigate the spread of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3092801557,"Background Teledentistry is believed to improve dentalcare provided to patients and time management efficiency. In addition, teledentistry can be a useful tool for peer education, consultations and ensures proper channeling for referrals. Objective This study aimed to explore Saudi Arabian dental professionals' perceptions of teledentistry's benefits in improving dental practice and patient care. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study involving an electronic survey of a sample of Saudi Arabian dental professionals. A validated 26-item, 5-point Likert-scale questionnaire was used to assess perceptions of dental professionals in four domains: usefulness of teledentistry for patients, the usefulness of teledentistry for dental practice; the potential of teledentistry to improve practice; and existing concerns about the use of teledentistry. Statistical analyses involved descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis using SPSS software. Significant differences were considered at a p-value of 0.05. Results With an overall response rate of 28.6%, 286 dental professionals participated in the study. More than 70% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that teledentistry would improve dental practice through enhancing communication with peers, guidance and referral of new patients. A substantial proportion of respondents (60–70%) expressed uncertainty with technical reliability, privacy and diagnostic accuracy. The participants' qualification was statistically significant with usefulness of teledentistry for patients (p = 0.027), while work experience in years was statistically significant with both usefulness of teledentistry for dental practice and patients (p = 0.046 and <0.0001 respectively). Conclusion Generally, the feedback gained by this study showed readiness of the dental professionals to be engaged in the teledentistry approach. Further investigation of the business model of teledentistry is needed to understand the readiness and challenges. Directed campaign to educate dentists and the public of the technology and it is potential is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3093114725,"The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control (China CDC) has been identified as a novel Betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). A computational approach was adopted to identify multiepitope vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 based on S, N and M proteins being able to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. In this study, the sequence of the virus was obtained from NCBI database and analyzed with in silico tools such as NetMHCpan, IEDB, BepiPred, NetCTL, Tap transport/proteasomal cleavage, Pa3P, GalexyPepDock, I-TASSER, Ellipro and ClusPro. To identify the most immunodominant regions, after analysis of population coverage and epitope conservancy, we proposed three different constructs based on linear B-cell, CTL and HTL epitopes. The 3D structure of constructs was assessed to find discontinuous B-cell epitopes. Among CTL predicted epitopes, S257-265, S603-611 and S360-368, and among HTL predicted epitopes, N167-181, S313-330 and S1110-1126 had better MHC binding rank. We found one putative CTL epitope, S360-368 related to receptor-binding domain (RBD) region for S protein. The predicted epitopes were non-allergen and showed a high quality of proteasomal cleavage and Tap transport efficiency and 100% conservancy within four different clades of SARS-CoV-2. For CTL and HTL epitopes, the highest population coverage of the world’s population was calculated for S27-37 with 86.27% and for S196-231, S303-323, S313-330, S1009-1030 and N328-349 with 90.33%, respectively. We identified overall 10 discontinuous B-cell epitopes for three multiepitope constructs. All three constructs showed strong interactions with TLRs 2, 3 and 4 supporting the hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to TLRs 2, 3 and 4 like other Coronaviridae families. These data demonstrated that the novel designed multiepitope constructs can contribute to develop SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccine candidates. The in vivo studies are underway using several vaccination strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3093458103,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept the whole world with high mortality. Since droplet transmission is the main route of transmission, wearing a mask serves as a crucial preventive measure. However, the virus has spread quite quickly, causing severe mask shortage. Finding alternative materials for homemade masks while ensuring the significant performance indicators will help alleviate the shortage of masks. Referring to the national standard for the “Surgical Mask” of China, 17 materials to be selected for homemade masks were tested in four key indicators: pressure difference, particle filtration efficiency, bacterial filtration efficiency and resistance to surface wetting. Eleven single-layer materials met the standard of pressure difference (≤49 Pa), of which 3 met the standard of resistance to surface wetting (≥3), 1 met the standard of particle filtration efficiency (≥30%), but none met the standard of bacterial filtration efficiency (≥95%). Based on the testing results of single-layer materials, fifteen combinations of paired materials were tested. The results showed that three double-layer materials including double-layer medical non-woven fabric, medical non-woven fabric plus non-woven shopping bag, and medical non-woven fabric plus granular tea towel could meet all the standards of pressure difference, particle filtration efficiency, and resistance to surface wetting, and were close to the standard of the bacterial filtration efficiency. In conclusion, if resources are severely lacking and medical masks cannot be obtained, homemade masks using available materials, based on the results of this study, can minimize the chance of infection to the maximum extent."
https://openalex.org/W3093390127,"Background To fight the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown has been decreed in many countries worldwide. The impact of pregnancy as a severity risk factor is still debated, but strict lockdown measures have been recommended for pregnant women. Objectives To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the seroprevalence and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a maternity ward in an area that has been significantly affected by the virus. Study design Prospective study at the Antoine Béclère Hospital maternity ward (Paris area, France) from May 4 (one week before the end of lockdown) to May 31, 2020 (three weeks after the end of lockdown). All patients admitted to the delivery room during this period were offered a SARS-CoV-2 serology test as well concomitant SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on one nasopharyngeal sample. Results A total of 249 women were included. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8%. The RT-PCR positive rate was 0.5%. 47.4% of the SARS-CoV-2-IgG-positive pregnant women never experienced any symptoms. A history of symptoms during the epidemic, such as fever (15.8%), myalgia (36.8%) and anosmia (31.6%), was suggestive of previous infection. Conclusions Three weeks after the end of French lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 infections were scarce in our region. A very high proportion of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-negative pregnant women, which is comparable to that of the general population, must be taken into consideration in the event of a resurgence of the pandemic. The traces of a past active circulation of the virus in this fragile population during the spring wave should encourage public health authorities to take specific measures for this independent at-risk group, in order to reduce viral circulation in pregnant patients."
https://openalex.org/W3093144668,"Bacteria play an important role in the degradation of bone material. However, much remains to be learnt about the structure of their communities in degrading bone, and how the depositional environment influences their diversity throughout the exposure period. We genetically profiled the bacterial community in an experimental series of pig bone fragments (femur and humeri) deposited at different well-defined environments in Denmark. The bacterial community in the bone fragments and surrounding depositional environment were studied over one year, and correlated with the bioerosion damage patterns observed microscopically in the bones. We observed that the bacterial communities within the bones were heavily influenced by the local microbial community, and that the general bone microbial diversity increases with time after exposure. We found the presence of several known collagenase producing bacterial groups, and also observed increases in the relative abundance of several of these in bones with tunneling. We anticipate that future analyses using shotgun metagenomics on this and similar datasets will be able to provide insights into mechanisms of microbiome driven bone degradation."
https://openalex.org/W3092676606,"The One Health paradigm recognizes that information on infectious diseases, zoonosis and related predictors in animal populations is essential. Pets live in close contact with humans and interact with wild animals, but the lack of reliable information on pet population size, demography and ownership profiles is a constant worldwide. Reliable data must be made available in order to address proper public health policies regarding the design of surveillance plans, the management of canine welfare and stray dog phenomenon, the control of dog behaviour-related problems, and the livestock/wildlife endangerment. Dog identification & registration (I&R) have become mandatory in most European countries in recent years, but the process is far from being widely accomplished, thus resulting in an underestimation of the real canine population. To date, data on the completeness of Dog Registries is very limited. A cross-sectional survey through 630 face-to-face questionnaires was performed with the aim of investigating the dog population size, demography, ownership profiles, and the I&R rate in central Italy. Logistic regression models investigated risk factors with the following outcome variables: dog presence into the Dog Registry, veterinary care frequency, and dog ownership. The present study identified that the dog population is higher than previously reported in Italy and in Europe, whilst lower compared to countries with a poor Human Development Index (a statistic composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators used by United Nation). Almost half of the interviewed people (47%) owned at least one dog, totalling 315 dogs. The mean number of dogs per household was 0.7 and 1.5 per dog-owning household. The Bayesian model estimated 481,294 (95% CI: 470,860–491,978) dogs (90 dogs/km2; human:dog ratio 9.0, 95% CI: 8.8–9.2) suggesting that a high density of people does not limit the dog ownership. Dogs resulted predominant among pets. The majority of dogs were males, crossbred, acquires as a gift, lived in rural areas, outdoors and attended a veterinary visit 1–2 times per year. The percentage of neutered dogs were higher in females (55%) than in males (8%). Only 75.3% (95% CI: 73.6–76.9) of the dogs were correctly identified and registered. The Dog Registry completeness increased during the first decades after its establishment, but no improvement has been made afterwards. The dogs correctly identified and registered were more likely to be purebred, neutered, lived in urban areas and visited a veterinarian frequently. Several strategies are recommended to encourage I&R, including promoting responsible dog ownership, engaging private veterinarians and dog breeders, and establishing an effective control system. The present study identified also that the dog source and the kind of feeding were variables associated with the veterinary care frequency. Owning a dog was associated with living in rural areas and the presence of children. The present study reported the poor presence of reliable predictors for the dog ownership. This is the first study to provide an estimate of the canine population abundance, characteristics, and ownership profiles in a European large metropolitan area."
https://openalex.org/W3092823457,"The industrial park of Quintero Bay (QB) in the central coast of Chile was established in the 1960s, presents high levels of pollution due to the industrial activity, and it is known as one of the five Chilean “sacrifice zones”. Lessonia spicata is the most important habitat-forming kelp species in the intertidal along the central and south shores of Chile, and currently there are no morphometric and population studies of L. spicata (or other seaweed species) nor studies about the effects of pollution on its development in QB and neighbouring sites. In this context, the aims of this study were (i) to register the abundance and morphological features of L. spicata populations from Ventanas, Horcón and Cachagua (sites with different pollution histories and located only up to 40 km from the QB); ii) to determine the heavy metals (HMs) concentration in seawater and marine sediments; and (iii) to evaluate in vitro the effects of exposure to seawater from the three sampling sites on spore release and early developmental stages, up to the juvenile sporophyte. Results showed that the chronically exposed Ventanas kelp population had the smallest adult individuals in comparison with the other sites. Ventanas and Horcón registered high HMs concentration in the seawater and marine sediments exceeding the international permissible limits (e.g in seawater Cu 20–859 μg L-1; sediments Cu > 50,000 μg kg-1). Unexpectedly in Cachagua, a site often considered unpolluted, high concentrations of Cu and As were also registered in the seawater (859 and 1,484 μg L-1, respectively) and of As in marine sediments (20,895 μg kg-1). Exposure of gametophytes to the seawater from Ventanas resulted in a developmental delay compared to the other treatments; however, low sporophyte production was determined in all treatments. Our results indicate that QB, more notably Ventanas, induce highly negative effects on individual development, and consequently on seaweed populations, which suggest a long-term negative impact on the community structure of these marine zones. Furthermore, the high concentrations of HMs reported here at Cachagua suggest a recent expansion of pollution along the central coast of Chile, evidencing effects on the marine ecosystem health even on sites far from the pollution source."
https://openalex.org/W3092894788,"Background After a spinal cord injury (SCI), individuals must acquire their maximum level of independence before returning to their previous social and working conditions. The education provided during rehabilitation is one of the basic but complex aspects that influence the health perspectives of people with SCI. Gaining the perspective of SCI survivors experienced barriers and resources to enhance the education process may assist healthcare professionals in understanding this complex aspect of their practice. Through a qualitative descriptive analysis, this study aimed to identify the perceived barriers and facilitators of education provided during the rehabilitation of individuals with SCI. Methods A purposive sample of 22 adults with SCI and at least six months of home experience was recruited. Participants were assigned into four mini focus groups according to their level of independence. The focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using a thematic analysis. Results Three themes were identified: the readiness to education, the individual characteristics, and the environmental and social characteristics influencing education. Participants perceived education to be an ongoing process made up of consecutive phases, each of which had to be overcome before participants felt ready to reappraise their health and well-being. This process was affected by individual, environmental, and social factors. Conclusions Education is constantly provided by all members of the rehabilitation team. These must stress the relevance of the contents presented, increase SCI survivors’ motivation to set achievable goals, and consider filling the gap that the patients perceive between rehabilitation centres and available community resources. The findings of this study promote the design of structured educational programmes, increasing knowledge, and improve the health perspective of SCI survivors, their families, and providers."
https://openalex.org/W3092717195,"Coronavirus disease- 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging contagious infectious disease. It is pandemic and has affected more than 21 million people and resulted in more than 750,000 deaths worldwide (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries; 14/08/20). Our research group initiated a study to ascertain the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of Jordanians toward COVID-19 prior to any initial case report in Jordan. This project was underway when the first Jordanian case was reported. We extended our study to identify how case reporting would alter public KAP towards COVID-19. This cross-sectional study randomly selected and recruited 2104 Jordanian adults. A four-section questionnaire was devised to address the sociodemographic characteristics of the subjects and their KAP toward COVID-19. The mean knowledge score for the study population was 15.9 ± 2.2 (out of the 20 knowledge questions), with 60.9% of the participants having good knowledge about COVID-19. Participants’ practices to prevent transmission of COVID-19 were adequate in more than 60% of participants. Most participants had positive attitudes regarding their role in preventing COVID-19 and many of the participants’ attitudes and practices changed to more appropriate ones after reporting the first case of COVID-19 in Jordan. The percentage of participants who trust the government in confronting COVID-19 increased significantly (p value < 0.001). However, one alarming and unexpected finding was that the prevention practice score of participants working in the medical field was similar to those from the general population. This may necessitate stricter training and guidelines for this group who will be in the frontline in combating the disease. Impact of this study: The data generated from this study shows that when cases of disease were reported, the public’s attitudes and practices improved in many aspects, and that confidence in the government to contain the disease was boosted. We believe that this study is important in allowing other, international governments to develop an understanding of public KAP during pandemic disease outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3093351588,"Background Understanding and monitoring the demographics of SARS-CoV-2 infection can inform strategies for prevention. Surveillance monitoring has suggested that the age distribution of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 has changed since the pandemic began, but no formal analysis has been performed. Methods Retrospective review of SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing results from a national reference laboratory was performed. Result distributions by age and positivity were compared between early period (March-April 2020) and late periods (June-July 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, a sub-analysis compared changing age distributions between inpatients and outpatients. Results There were 277,601 test results of which 19320 (7.0%) were positive. The median age of infected people declined over time (p < 0.0005). In March-April, the median age of positive people was 40.8 years (Interquartile range (IQR): 29.0–54.1). In June-July, the median age of positive people was 35.8 years (IQR: 24.0–50.2). The positivity rate of patients under 50 increased from 6.0 to 10.6 percent and the positivity rate for those over 50 decreased from 6.3 to 5.0 percent between the early and late periods. The trend was only observed for outpatient populations. Conclusions We confirm that there is a trend toward decreasing age among persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, but that these trends seem to be specific to the outpatient population. Overall, this suggests that observed age-related trends are driven by changes in testing patterns rather than true changes in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This calls for caution in interpretation of routine surveillance data until testing patterns stabilize."
https://openalex.org/W3093402178,"Background The Japan Chronic Kidney Disease Database (J-CKD-DB) is a nationwide clinical database of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on electronic health records. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalences of hyperuricemia and electrolyte abnormalities in Japanese patients with CKD. Methods In total, 35,508 adult outpatients with estimated glomerular filtration rates of 5–60 ml/min/1.73 m2 in seven university hospitals were included this analysis. The proportions of patients with CKD stages G3b, G4, and G5 were 23.5%, 7.6%, and 3.1%, respectively. Results Logistic regression analysis showed that prevalence of hyperuricemia was associated with CKD stages G3b (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 2.12 [1.90–2.37]), G4 (4.57 [3.92–5.32]), and G5 (2.25 [1.80–2.80]). The respective prevalences of hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and narrower difference between serum sodium and chloride concentrations were elevated in patients with CKD stages G3b, G4, and G5, compared with those prevalences in patients with CKD stage G3a. The prevalences of hyperkalemia were 8.3% and 11.6% in patients with CKD stages G4 and G5, respectively. In patients with CKD stage G5, the proportions of patients with optimal ranges of serum uric acid, potassium, corrected calcium, and phosphate were 49.6%, 73.5%, 81.9%, and 56.1%, respectively. Conclusions We determined the prevalences of hyperuricemia and electrolyte abnormalities in Japanese patients with CKD using data from a nationwide cohort study."
https://openalex.org/W3093021557,"Objectives There are more than 300 million smokers in China. This study aimed to evaluate the rate of smoking cessation, smoking relapse and related factors in middle-aged and older smokers in China. Methods We performed a secondary analysis of data from China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) that recruited a nationally representative sample of adults aged 45 and older. Participants were 3708 smokers in 2011 who completed two waves of follow-up interviews in 2013 and 2015. Self-reported quit and relapse rates at follow-ups were estimated. Multiple logistic regressions were conducted to identify factors associated with smoking cessation and relapse. Results The overall quit rate was 8.5% (95% CI 7.7% - 9.5%) at the 2-year follow-up in 2013, and 16.6% (95% CI 15.5% - 17.9%) at the 4-year follow up. Smoking cessation in 2013 was associated with not living in the northeast region (p = 0.003), fewer cigarettes smoked daily (p <0.001), and longer time to the first cigarette in the morning (p<0.001). Smoking cessation in 2015 was associated with older age (p = 0.049), smoking initiation at age ≥20 years (p<0.001), longer time to the first cigarette in the morning (p<0.001), and self-perceived poor health (p<0.001). Of the 317 participants who stopped smoking in 2013, 13.3% (95% CI 9.9% - 17.5%) relapsed by 2015. Smoking relapse was associated with younger age (p = 0.025), shorter time to the first cigarette in the morning (p = 0.003), and self-perception of not poor health (p = 0.018). Conclusion The overall quit rate was 8.5% at the 2-year follow up, and 16.6% at the 4-year follow up in the middle-aged and older smokers, but 13% of quitters returned to smoking in two years. Successful smoking cessation was associated with older age, lower nicotine dependence, and self-perceived poor health."
https://openalex.org/W3093127411,"Introduction The aim of this study was to assess cognitive differences between male and female adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Methods Patients with an ADHD diagnosis according to the DSM-IV guidelines were included in a cross-sectional study evaluating cognitive measures. 28 women and 41 men from ages 19 to 56 completed self-report questionnaires and performed a computer-based test of attentional performance (TAP). The TAP assesses cognitive functions highly affected in ADHD patients, including working memory, alertness and attention as well as behavioral control and response inhibition. Results There were no measurable differences in self-report scales assessing current symptomology between the sexes, however men scored higher on the scale for childhood symptoms. Performance measures for general wakefulness were comparable between men and women, while working memory and behavioral control test results differed. Females reacted significantly slower and more unstable for both the TAP Go/NoGo paradigm and working memory subtest, while also making more errors in the latter. Conclusions We found gender-specific effects regarding working memory and behavioral control in this sample of adult patients with ADHD. Further studies are warranted, examining whether these differences relate to differences in clinical presentation and comorbidity patterns between men and women."
https://openalex.org/W3093421705,"Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the association between preschool playground size, formalized physical activity (PA) policies, time spent outdoors and preschool teacher’s levels of PA and children’s objectively assessed levels of PA and sedentary time (ST) during preschool hours. Methods In total, 369 children and 84 preschool teachers from 27 preschools in Södermalm municipally, Stockholm Sweden wore an Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometer during 7 consecutive days. Preschool environmental and structural characteristics were measured via the Environment and Policy Evaluation Self-Report (EPAO-SR) instrument and time in- and outdoors was recorded by preschool teachers during the PA measurements. Weight and height of children were measured via validated scales and parents filled out a questionnaire on demographical and descriptive variables. Linear mixed models, nested on preschool level, were used to assess the association between predictors and outcomes. Results The mean child age was 4.7 years (SD 0.8) and 45% were girls. We found that children were more active in preschools with a formalized PA policy, compared to preschools without such a policy, but not less sedentary. The association between policy and activity seemed to be more pronounced when accounting for other environmental factors. Similar associations were found in children spent most time outdoors (uppermost quartile) compared with children spent least time outdoors (Lowermost quartile). Preschool teachers’ light PA (LPA) (ß = 0.25, P = 0.004) and steps (ß = 0.52, P<0.001) were associated with children’s LPA and steps while the preschool playground size showed no association with PA in children, when accounting for other environmental factors. Conclusion The current study showed that preschool structural characteristics such as formalized PA policies and more time spent outdoors were positively associated with children’s PA. These findings suggest that formalized PA policies and time outdoors may be of importance for promoting children’s PA during preschool hours."
https://openalex.org/W3092973594,"No sensitive method for diagnosing early kidney dysfunction in horses has been identified so far. Many studies carried out in humans and small animals show that podocin can be useful to diagnose various kidney diseases, mainly affecting the glomeruli. The aim of this study was to perform a qualitative and quantitative analysis of podocin in urine samples obtained from healthy horses, horses with clinical kidney dysfunction and horses at risk of acute kidney injury. The study objectives aimed to assess: (1) whether the selected podocin tryptic peptide for LC-MS-MRM allows for podocin detection in horse; and (2) whether the species-specific ELISA test makes this detection possible as well;, (3) whether the chosen methods are sensitive enough to detect kidney dysfunction and glomerular injury, (4) whether the results of the tests applying both methods correspond with one another, (5) whether the results correlate with the hematological and biochemical data. The signals that may indicate the presence of trypsin fragments of podocin were found in three healthy horses, all the horses diagnosed with kidney dysfunction and half of the animals at risk for acute kidney injury. The concentration of podocin, diagnosed with the ELISA test was as follows: from 0.19 to 1.2 ng/ml in healthy animals, from 0.19 to 20.0 ng/ml in AKI horses, from 0.29 to 5.71 ng/ml in horses at risk for acute kidney injury. The results of both methods corresponded significantly. Podocin may be a potential biomarker of clinical kidney disease in horses and may be used in the detection of glomerular injury. However, its use is limited by the possibility of physiological podocyturia. LC-MS-MRM seems to be a more sensitive method to evaluate the presence of podocin than the ELISA test, whilst selected tryptic peptides of podocin appear to apply to horses. The ELISA test showed greater effectiveness in excluding the disease than in confirming it."
https://openalex.org/W3092990243,"Introduction Community detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) is a challenge. While Gold Standard assessments are commonly used in research centers, these methods are time consuming, require extensive training, and are not practical in most clinical settings or in community-based research projects. Many of these methods require an informant (e.g., spouse, adult child) to provide ratings of the patients’ cognitive and functional abilities. A patient-reported outcome that captures the presence of cognitive impairment and corresponds to Gold Standard assessments could improve case ascertainment, clinical care, and recruitment into clinical research. We tested the patient version of the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS) as a patient-reported outcome to detect MCI and ADRD. Methods The patient QDRS was validated in a sample of 261 consecutive patient-caregiver dyads compared with the informant version of the QDRS, the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), neuropsychological tests, and Gold Standard measures of function, behavior, and mood. Psychometric properties including item variability, floor and ceiling effects, construct, concurrent, and known-groups validity, and internal consistency were determined. Results The patient QDRS strongly correlated with Gold Standard measures of cognition, function, mood, behavior, and global staging methods (p-values < .001) and had strong psychometric properties with excellent data quality and internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.923, 95%CI:0.91–0.94). The patient QDRS had excellent agreement with the informant QDRS, the CDR and its sum of boxes (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients: 9.781–0.876). Receiver operator characteristic curves showed excellent discrimination between normal controls from CDR 0.5 (AUC:0.820;95% CI: 0.74–0.90) and for normal controls from any cognitive impairment (AUC:0.885;95% CI: 0.83–0.94). Discussion The patient QDRS validly and reliably differentiates individuals with and without cognitive impairment and can be completed by patients through all stages of dementia. The patient QDRS is highly correlated with Gold Standard measures of cognitive, function, behavior, and global staging. The patient QDRS provides a rapid method to screen patients for MCI and ADRD in clinical practice, determine study eligibility, improve case ascertainment in community studies."
https://openalex.org/W3093104936,"Taste bud cells arise from local epithelial stem cells in the oral cavity and are continuously replaced by newborn cells throughout an animal's life. However, little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms of taste cell turnover. Recently, it has been demonstrated that SOX2, a transcription factor expressed in epithelial stem/progenitor cells of the oral cavity, regulates turnover of anterior tongue epithelium including gustatory and non-gustatory papillae. Yet, the role of SOX2 in regulating taste cell turnover in the posterior tongue is unclear. Prompted by the fact that there are regional differences in the cellular and molecular composition of taste buds and stem/progenitor cells in the anterior and posterior portions of tongue, which are derived from distinct embryonic origins, we set out to determine the role of SOX2 in epithelial tissue homeostasis in the posterior tongue. Here we report the differential requirement of SOX2 in the stem/progenitor cells for the normal turnover of lingual epithelial cells in the posterior tongue. Sox2 deletion in the stem/progenitor cells neither induced active caspase 3-mediated apoptotic cell death nor altered stem/progenitor cell population in the posterior tongue. Nevertheless, morphology and molecular feature of non-gustatory epithelial cells were impaired in the circumvallate papilla but not in the filiform papillae. Remarkably, taste buds became thinner, collapsed, and undetectable over time. Lineage tracing of Sox2-deleted stem/progenitor cells demonstrated an almost complete lack of newly generated basal precursor cells in the taste buds, suggesting mechanistically that Sox2 is involved in determining stem/progenitor cells to differentiate to gustatory lineage cells. Together, these results demonstrate that SOX2 plays key roles in regulating epithelial tissue homeostasis in the posterior tongue, similar but not identical to its function in the anterior tongue."
https://openalex.org/W3092974589,"The spread of COVID-19 implied a large and fast increase of demand for intensive care services. To face this increase in demand, health care systems need to adapt their response by increasing hospital beds, intensive care unit (ICU) capacity and by (re-)deploying doctors and other personnel. This paper proposes a forecast approach based on the Vector Error Correction model for the daily counts of hospitalized patients with symptoms and of patients in ICU, using publicly available data on the current COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, Switzerland and Spain. The level of analysis is the local government managing the health care system response, which corresponds to regions for Italy. The one-week-ahead forecasts are validated with out-of-sample data over successive weeks; they are found to provide timely and robust prediction of ICU capacity needs in Lombardy, the most-affected Italian region, starting from the sample of the first 2 weeks of data. The same methodology is successfully validated on other Italian regions, Switzerland and Spain. This approach may be used in other countries/regions/provinces to help adapt the health care system response to COVID-19 (or other similar disease); for this purpose, the open-source software code to produce the forecasts is provided with the paper."
https://openalex.org/W3092828784,"Aim Acanthosis nigricans (AN) is a strong correlate of obesity and is considered a marker of insulin resistance (IR). AN is associated with various other cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs). However, the direct causal relationship of IR with AN in obesity has been debated. Therefore, we aimed to examine the complex causal relationships among the troika of AN, obesity, and IR in Mexican Americans (MAs). Methods We used data from 670 non-diabetic MA children, aged 6–17 years (49% girls). AN (prevalence 33%) severity scores (range 0–5) were used as a quasi-quantitative trait (AN-q) for analysis. We used the program SOLAR for determining phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations between AN-q and CMRFs (e.g., BMI, HOMA-IR, lipids, blood pressure, hs-C-reactive protein (CRP), and Harvard physical fitness score (PFS)). The genetic and environmental correlations were subsequently used in mediation analysis (AMOS program). Model comparisons were made using goodness-of-fit indexes. Results Heritability of AN-q was 0.75 (p<0.0001). It was positively/significantly (p<0.05) correlated with traits such as BMI, HOMA-IR, and CRP, and negatively with HDL-C and PFS. Of the models tested, indirect mediation analysis of BMI→HOMA-IR→AN-q yielded lower goodness-of-fit than a partial mediation model where BMI explained the relationship with both HOMA-IR and AN-q simultaneously. Using complex models, BMI was associated with AN-q and IR mediating most of the CMRFs; but no relationship between IR and AN-q. Conclusion Our study suggests that obesity explains the association of IR with AN, but no causal relationship between IR and AN in Mexican American children."
https://openalex.org/W3093315954,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a lethal disease characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary artery pressure due to an increase in vessel tone and occlusion of vessels. The endogenous vasodilator prostacyclin and its analogs are used as therapeutic agents for PAH. However, their pharmacological effects on occlusive vascular remodeling have not been elucidated yet. Selexipag is a recently approved, orally available and selective prostacyclin receptor agonist with a non-prostanoid structure. In this study, we investigated the pharmacological effects of selexipag on the pathology of chronic severe PAH in Sprague-Dawley and Fischer rat models in which PAH was induced by a combination of injection with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor antagonist Sugen 5416 and exposure to hypoxia (SuHx). Oral administration of selexipag for three weeks significantly improved right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy in Sprague-Dawley SuHx rats. Selexipag attenuated the proportion of lung vessels with occlusive lesions and the medial wall thickness of lung arteries, corresponding to decreased numbers of Ki-67-positive cells and a reduced expression of collagen type 1 in remodeled vessels. Administration of selexipag to Fischer rats with SuHx-induced PAH reduced RV hypertrophy and mortality caused by RV failure. These effects were probably based on the potent prostacyclin receptor agonistic effect of selexipag on pulmonary vessels. Selexipag has been approved and is used in the clinical treatment of PAH worldwide. It is thought that these beneficial effects of prostacyclin receptor agonists on multiple aspects of PAH pathology contribute to the clinical outcomes in patients with PAH."
https://openalex.org/W3092835014,"In bimodal listening, cochlear implant (CI) users combine electric hearing (EH) in one ear and acoustic hearing (AH) in the other ear. In electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS), CI users combine EH and AH in the same ear. In quiet, integration of EH and AH has been shown to be better with EAS, but with greater sensitivity to tonotopic mismatch in EH. The goal of the present study was to evaluate how external noise might affect integration of AH and EH within or across ears. Recognition of monosyllabic words was measured for normal-hearing subjects listening to simulations of unimodal (AH or EH alone), EAS, and bimodal listening in quiet and in speech-shaped steady noise (10 dB, 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio). The input/output frequency range for AH was 0.1–0.6 kHz. EH was simulated using an 8-channel noise vocoder. The output frequency range was 1.2–8.0 kHz to simulate a shallow insertion depth. The input frequency range was either matched (1.2–8.0 kHz) or mismatched (0.6–8.0 kHz) to the output frequency range; the mismatched input range maximized the amount of speech information, while the matched input resulted in some speech information loss. In quiet, tonotopic mismatch differently affected EAS and bimodal performance. In noise, EAS and bimodal performance was similarly affected by tonotopic mismatch. The data suggest that tonotopic mismatch may differently affect integration of EH and AH in quiet and in noise."
https://openalex.org/W3093463173,"Background Household contacts (HHC) of tuberculosis (TB) patients are at risk of TB infection and disease. The study assessed the utility of “Household contact card and register” for screening of HHC of pulmonary TB (PTB) patients for TB and explored the reasons for HHC not being screened and followed-up. Methods The “Household contact card and register” was implemented by the Health Care Workers (HCW) of the TB Control Programme in Chennai District for screening HHC of index PTB patients initiated on treatment between June and August, 2018. Contacts were required to be screened within 2 months of treatment initiation of the index patient. Details collected included age, gender, smoking, alcohol use, immunosuppressive conditions and TB treatment. Symptom screening along with chest radiograph and or sputum examination was attempted. Follow-up TB screening at 6 and 12 months were performed. Screening of HHC was compared pre and post implementation phase. Proportions were computed for the data analysed. Results HHC information was documented for 93% (1268/1364) of Index PTB patients. The main reasons of non-listing of HHC in 96 PTB patients were HCW non-availability or non-co-operation of the HHC. There were 2150 (80%) contacts who were screened for TB. Inconvenient time, feeling healthy, stigma, out-station visit were the main reasons for 537 contacts not undergoing TB screening. Anti-TB treatment was initiated in 21 (1%) of contacts diagnosed with TB. Preventive therapy was initiated in 59% (81/138) of contacts aged <6 years. The screening of HHC improved from 36% to 80% during the implementation phase. Follow-up TB screening at 12 months was performed in 50% of HHC and 2 incident TB cases were identified. Conclusion “Household contact card and register” is a useful tool for HCWs for TB screening in HHC of PTB patients. Reasons for non-adherence to contact screening needs to be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W3092846825,"Background Increased acute rejection risk in rescue protocols with Belatacept may limit its use particularly in medically complex patients where preexisting increased risk of rejection couples with CNI toxicity. Methods Retrospective analysis was performed in 19 KTs shifted to a Belatacept-based immunosuppression with low-dose Tacrolimus (2–3 ng/mL) after evidence of allograft disfunction, including patients with primary non-function (PNF), chronic-active antibody-mediated rejection (cAMR), history of previous KTs and/or other concomitant transplants (liver, pancreas). Evaluation of CD28+ CD4+ effector memory T cell (TEM) before conversion was performed in 10/19. Results Kidney function significantly improved (median eGFR 16.5 ml/min/1.73m2 before vs 25 ml/min after; p = 0.001) at a median time after conversion of 12.5 months (9.1–17.8). Overall graft and patient survival were 89.5% and 100% respectively. Definitive weaning from dialysis in 5/5 KTs with PNF was observed, whereas 7/8 patients lost their graft within first year in a control group. eGFR significantly ameliorated in re-trasplants (p = 0.001) and stabilized in KTs with other organ transplants or cAMR. No acute rejection episodes occurred, despite the significant risk suggested by high frequency of CD28+ CD4+ TEM in most patients. Opportunistic infections were limited and most common in early vs late-converted. Conclusions Rescue association of Belatacept with low-dose Tacrolimus in medically complex KTs is a feasible option that allows prevention of acute rejection and amelioration of graft function."
https://openalex.org/W3093354536,"Vision is obtained with a continuous motion of the eyes. The kinematic analysis of eye motion, during any visual or ocular task, typically reveals two (kinematic) components: saccades, which quickly replace the visual content in the retinal fovea, and drifts, which slowly scan the image after each saccade. While the saccadic exchange of regions of interest (ROIs) is commonly considered to be included in motor-sensory closed-loops, it is commonly assumed that drifts function in an open-loop manner, that is, independent of the concurrent visual input. Accordingly, visual perception is assumed to be based on a sequence of open-loop processes, each initiated by a saccade-triggered retinal snapshot. Here we directly challenged this assumption by testing the dependency of drift kinematics on concurrent visual inputs using real-time gaze-contingent-display. Our results demonstrate a dependency of the trajectory on the concurrent visual input, convergence of speed to condition-specific values and maintenance of selected drift-related motor-sensory controlled variables, all strongly indicative of drifts being included in a closed-loop brain-world process, and thus suggesting that vision is inherently a closed-loop process."

In order to study the genes related to sex determination, transcriptome sequencing was performed on flower buds of male and female plants using the high-throughput sequencing technology. A total of 145,975 unigenes and 7110 DEGs were obtained. There were 6776 DEGs annotated to 1234 GO terms and enriched to 18 functional groups, including five biological processes related to sugar metabolism. KEGG pathway analysis indicated genes involved in hormone transduction, hormone synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. Many DEGs of TK are involved in reproductive organ formation, hormone signal transduction and regulatory networks. Combining the results of GO, KEGG and qRT-PCR, 11 sex determining candidate genes of TK were selected, including MYB80, MYB108, CER1, CBL9, ABCB19, SERK1, HSP81-3, ACS9, SEP3, AUX1 and YUC6. The results provide a foundation for the study of sex differentiation in TK."
https://openalex.org/W3093050966,"To improve the single-layer all-solid-state ion selective electrode’ defects including poor conductivity of PVC sensitive membrane and interference of water layer between substrate electrode and sensitive membrane, a double-layer all-solid-state ion selective electrode with nanomaterial as the solid contact layer and conductive polymer as the ion sensitive membrane was developed. A gold nanoparticles solid contact layer and a nitrate-doped polypyrrole molecularly imprinted polymer membrane were prepared by electrodeposition. The optimal parameters obtained by electrochemical performance test were 2.5 mmol/L HAuCl4 electrolyte for solid contact layer and 1800s electrodeposition time for sensitive membrane. The new electrode exhibited a Nernstian response of -50.4 mV/decade and a low detection limit of 5.25×10-5mol/L. Potentiometric water layer test showed no water film formed between the gold nanoparticles solid contact layer and nitrate-doped polypyrrole molecularly imprinted polymer membrane. The contact angle between droplet and the surface of solid contact layer was 112.35° and showed good hydrophobic property. Furthermore, the developed electrode exhibited fast response, excellent potential stability and long lifetime. This electrode is suitable for the detection of nitrate concentration in water and liquid fertilizer."
https://openalex.org/W3093150129,"Infrared neural stimulation has been studied for its potential to replace an electrical stimulation of a cochlear implant. No studies, however, revealed how the technic reliably evoke auditory cortical activities. This research investigated the effects of cochlear laser stimulation from the outer ear on auditory cortex using brain imaging of activity-dependent changes in mitochondrial flavoprotein fluorescence signal. An optic fiber was inserted into the gerbil’s ear canal to stimulate the lateral side of the cochlea with an infrared laser. Laser stimulation was found to activate the identified primary auditory cortex. In addition, the temporal profile of the laser-evoked responses was comparable to that of the auditory responses. Our results indicate that infrared laser irradiation from the outer ear has the capacity to evoke, and possibly manipulate, the neural activities of the auditory cortex and may substitute for the present cochlear implants in future."
https://openalex.org/W3093305045,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is often isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotics are the primary line of treatment for pneumococcal pneumonia; however, rising antimicrobial resistance is becoming more prevalent. Hinokitiol, which is isolated from trees in the cypress family, has been demonstrated to exert antibacterial activity against S. pneumoniae in vitro regardless of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, the efficacy of hinokitiol was investigated in a mouse pneumonia model. Male 8-week-old BALB/c mice were intratracheally infected with S. pneumoniae strains D39 (antimicrobial susceptible) and NU4471 (macrolide resistant). After 1 h, hinokitiol was injected via the tracheal route. Hinokitiol significantly decreased the number of S. pneumoniae in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the concentration of pneumococcal DNA in the serum, regardless of whether bacteria were resistant or susceptible to macrolides. In addition, hinokitiol decreased the infiltration of neutrophils in the lungs, as well as the concentration of inflammatory cytokines in the BALF and serum. Repeated hinokitiol injection at 18 h intervals showed downward trend in the number of S. pneumoniae in the BALF and the concentration of S. pneumoniae DNA in the serum with the number of hinokitiol administrations. These findings suggest that hinokitiol reduced bacterial load and suppressed excessive host immune response in the pneumonia mouse model. Accordingly, hinokitiol warrants further exploration as a potential candidate for the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W3093060963,"Mathematical models are powerful tools to investigate, simulate, and evaluate potential interventions for infectious diseases dynamics. Much effort has focused on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)-type compartment models. These models consider host populations and measure change of each compartment. In this study, we propose an alternative patch dynamic modeling framework from pathogens' perspective. Each patch, the basic module of this modeling framework, has four standard mechanisms of pathogen population size change: birth (replication), death, inflow, and outflow. This framework naturally distinguishes between-host transmission process (inflow and outflow) and within-host infection process (replication) during the entire transmission-infection cycle. We demonstrate that the SIR-type model is actually a special cross-sectional and discretized case of our patch dynamics model in pathogens' viewpoint. In addition, this patch dynamics modeling framework is also an agent-based model from hosts' perspective by incorporating individual host's specific traits. We provide an operational standard to formulate this modular-designed patch dynamics model. Model parameterization is feasible with a wide range of sources, including genomics data, surveillance data, electronic health record, and from other emerging technologies such as multiomics. We then provide two proof-of-concept case studies to tackle some of the existing challenges of SIR-type models: sexually transmitted disease and healthcare acquired infections. This patch dynamics modeling framework not only provides theoretical explanations to known phenomena, but also generates novel insights of disease dynamics from a more holistic viewpoint. It is also able to simulate and handle more complicated scenarios across biological scales such as the current COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3093240646,"Truncating mutations in the tumour suppressor gene APC occur frequently in colorectal cancers and result in the deregulation of Wnt signalling as well as changes in cell-cell adhesion. Using quantitative imaging based on the detection of membrane-associated E-cadherin, we undertook a protein coding genome-wide siRNA screen to identify genes that regulate cell surface E-cadherin in the APC-defective colorectal cancer cell line SW480. We identified a diverse set of regulators of E-cadherin that offer new insights into the regulation of cell-cell adhesion, junction formation and genes that regulate proliferation or survival of SW480 cells. Among the genes whose depletion promotes membrane-associated E-cadherin, we identified ZEB1, the microRNA200 family, and proteins such as a ubiquitin ligase UBE2E3, CDK8, sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) and the matrix metalloproteinases, MMP14 and MMP19. The screen also identified 167 proteins required for maintaining E-cadherin at cell-cell adherens junctions, including known junctional proteins, CTNND1 and CTNNA1, as well as signalling enzymes, DUSP4 and MARK2, and transcription factors, TEAD3, RUNX2 and TRAM2. A better understanding of the post-translational regulation of E-cadherin provides new opportunities for restoring cell-cell adhesion in APC-defective cells."
https://openalex.org/W3092796065,"Future land use projections are needed to inform long-term planning and policy. However, most projections require downscaling into spatially explicit projection rasters for ecosystem service analyses. Empirical demand-allocation algorithms input coarse-level transition quotas and convert cells across the raster, based on a modeled probability surface. Such algorithms typically employ contagious and/or random allocation approaches. We present a hybrid seeding approach designed to generate a stochastic collection of spatial realizations for distributional analysis, by 1) randomly selecting a seed cell from a sample of n cells, then 2) converting patches of neighboring cells based on transition probability and distance to the seed. We generated a collection of realizations from 2001-2011 for the conterminous USA at 90m resolution based on varying the value of n, then computed forest area by fragmentation class and compared the results with observed 2011 forest area by fragmentation class. We found that realizations based on values of n ≤ 256 generally covered observed forest fragmentation at regional scales, for approximately 70% of assessed cases. We also demonstrate the potential of the seeding algorithm for distributional analysis by generating 20 trajectories of realizations from 2020-2070 from a single example scenario. Generating a library of such trajectories from across multiple scenarios will enable analysis of projected patterns and downstream ecosystem services, as well as their variation."
https://openalex.org/W3092872614,"Photosynthates generated after heading contributes to 60% - 80% of grain yield in rice. Delay in leaf senescence can contribute to a long grain-filling period and thereby increased yield. The objective of this study was to identify genomic region(s) responsible for delayed leaf senescence (DLS) and validate the role of underlying candidate genes in controlling target traits. 302 BC2F4 backcross-derived lines (BILs) developed from a cross between Swarna and Moroberekan were phenotyped for two seasons (DS2016 and WS2017) for chlorophyll content and yield parameters. KASPar-SNP assays based genotyping data with 193 SNPs of mapping population was used to identify the targeted genomic region(s). Significant positive correlation was observed between the two most important determinants of DLS traits viz., RDCF (reduced decline degree of chlorophyll content of flag leaf) and RDCS (reduced decline degree of chlorophyll content of second leaf) with plant height (PH), grain number per panicle (GPN), panicle length (PL), number of tiller (NT) and grain yield (GY). A total of 41 and 29 QTLs with phenotypic variance (PVE) ranging from 8.2 to 25.1% were detected for six DLS traits during DS2016 and WS2017, respectively. Out of these identified QTLs, 19 were considered as stable QTLs detected across seasons. 17 of the identified stable QTLs were found to be novel. In-silico analysis revealed five key genes regulating chlorophyll metabolism. Expression analysis of these genes confirmed their strong association with the senescence pattern in leaf tissue of parents as well as selected phenotypically extreme lines. The identified stable QTLs regulating DLS traits and validation of potential candidate genes provides insight into genetic basis of delayed senescence and is expected to contribute in enhancing grain yield through genomics-assisted breeding (GAB)."
https://openalex.org/W3092963244,"All Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains contain multiple copies of integrated filamentous phage genomes with undefined structures. In this study, we sought to characterize the capsid proteins of filamentous N. gonorrhoeae bacteriophage NgoΦ6 and phagemids propagated in different bacteria. The data demonstrate that purified phage contain phage-encoded structural proteins and bacterial host proteins; host proteins consistently copurified with the phage particles. The bacterial host proteins associated with the phage filament (as identified by mass spectrometry) tended to be one of the predominant outer membrane components of the host strain, plus minor additional host proteins. We were able to copurify a functional ß-lactamase, a phagemid-encoded protein, with phage filaments. We used protein modeling and immunological analysis to identify the major phage encoded structural proteins. The antigenic properties of these proteins depended on the bacterium where the phages were propagated. Polyclonal antibodies against N. gonorrhoeae phage NgoΦ6 recognized phage-encoded proteins if the phage was propagated in N. gonorrhoeae or H. influenzae cells but not if it was propagated in Salmonella or E. coli. We show that the phage filaments isolated from gonococci and Haemophilus are glycosylated, and this may explain the antigenic diversity seen. Taken en toto, the data demonstrate that while the neisserial filamentous phage are similar to other Inovirus with respect to overall genomic organization, their ability to closely associate with host proteins suggests that they have unique surface properties and are secreted by a here-to-fore unknown secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3093054648,"Background 
Serosurveys are a valuable surveillance tool because they provide a more direct measure of population immunity to infectious diseases, such as measles and rubella, than vaccination coverage estimates. However, there is concern that serological surveys are costly. We adapted a framework to capture the costs associated with conducting a serosurvey in Zambia.


Methods 
We costed a nested serosurvey in Southern Province, Zambia that collected dried blood spots from household residents in a post-campaign vaccine coverage survey. The financial costs were estimated using an ingredients-based costing approach. Inputs included personnel, transportation, field consumable items, social mobilization, laboratory supplies, and capital items, and were classified by serosurvey function (survey preparation, data collection, biospecimen collection, laboratory testing, and coordination). Inputs were stratified by whether they were applicable to surveys in general or attributable specifically to serosurveys. Finally, we calculated the average cost per cluster and participant.


Results 
We estimated the total nested serosurvey cost was US $68,558 to collect dried blood spots from 658 participants in one province in Zambia. A breakdown of the cost by serosurvey phase showed data collection accounted for almost one third of the total serosurvey cost (32%), followed by survey preparation (25%) and biospecimen collection (20%). Analysis by input categories indicated personnel costs were the largest contributing input to overall serosurvey costs (51%), transportation was second (23%), and field consumables were third (9%). By combining the serosurvey with a vaccination coverage survey, there was a savings of $43,957. We estimated it cost $4,285 per average cluster and $104 per average participant sampled.


Conclusions 
Adding serological specimen collection to a planned vaccination coverage survey provided a more direct measurement of population immunity among a wide age group but increased the cost by approximately one-third. Future serosurveys could consider ways to leverage existing surveys conducted for other purposes to minimize costs."
https://openalex.org/W3093278985,"Dietary specialization, exploiting a small fraction of available food resources, is commonly reported for gulls and skuas. Predation of birds by these species is usually considered a specialist strategy employed by the minority of the population but non-specialists also predate birds and may actually have a greater impact on the prey species. To date, most studies have focused on predatory bird-specialists, down-playing the possible importance of opportunistic predation by non-specialists. We addressed this by studying diet (regurgitated pellets and prey remains) and behavior of breeding Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) over three summers at Gull Island, a mixed-species breeding colony in Lake Ontario. One-third of all pellets analyzed contained bird remains, primarily the most numerous breeding bird: Ring-billed Gull (L. delawarensis) chicks (51%) and adults (36%). Although all but one pair of Herring Gulls ate birds, all pairs maintained broad and mostly similar diets, with birds accounting for at most one-third of prey. Behavior also indicated that Herring Gulls at Gull Island were not predatory bird-specialists because predation was too infrequent to meet energetic requirements, was largely unsuccessful and was only ever observed when Ring-billed Gulls strayed into Herring Gull breeding territories. Instead, bird predation appeared mainly opportunistic, increasing with seasonal availability, access to shoreline, proximity to nesting Ring-billed Gulls and breeding territory size. Compared with predatory specialist Herring Gulls in the same region, individuals that predated birds at Gull Island did not display specialist behaviors and killed six times fewer birds (0.1–0.4 per day, on average) but were over 20 times more numerous (98% of the population versus 4%). Thus, our results indicate that opportunistic predation by non-specialists may have important consequences for prey species. Since opportunistic predation cannot be effectively managed using techniques widely advocated for specialist predators, it is essential to investigate cause of predation by large gulls prior to lethal management."

We uncovered genes involved in the production of antimicrobial compounds like 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG), pyoluteorin, and lectin-like bacteriocins. These antimicrobial compounds are also produced by other fluorescent pseudomonads alike P. protegens. Double-layer agar assay showed that P. protegens EMM-1 inhibited the growth of several multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, especially clinical isolates of the genera Klebsiella and β-hemolytic Streptococcus. This strain also displayed inhibitory effects against diverse fungi, such as Aspergillus, Botrytis, and Fusarium. Besides, a crude extract of inhibitory substances secreted into agar was obtained after the cold-leaching process, and physicochemical characterization was performed. The partially purified inhibitory substances produced by P. protegens EMM-1 inhibited the growth of Streptococcus sp. and Microbacterium sp., but no inhibitory effect was noted for other bacterial or fungal strains. The molecular weight determined after ultrafiltration was between 3 and 10 kDa. The inhibitory activity was thermally stable up to 60°C (but completely lost at 100°C), and the inhibitory activity remained active in a wide pH range (from 3 to 9). After treatment with a protease from Bacillus licheniformis, the inhibitory activity was decreased by 90%, suggesting the presence of proteic natural compounds. All these findings suggested that P. protegens EMM-1 is a potential source of antimicrobials to be used against pathogens for humans and plants."

Here we show that intramuscular (IM) injection alone or a combination of IM plus intranasal (IN) immunization generated antibodies to PNAG that functioned to deposit complement and mediate opsonophagocytic killing of SEE ex vivo. However, immunization strategies targeting PNAG either by either IM only injection or a combination of IM and IN immunizations failed to protect yearling horses against infection following contact with infected horses in an experimental setting.

https://openalex.org/W3093000671,"People with HIV (PWH) continue to experience sensory neuropathy and neuropathic pain in the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era for unclear reasons. This study evaluated the role of iron in a previously reported association of iron-loading hemochromatosis (HFE) gene variants with reduced risk of neuropathy in PWH who received more neurotoxic cART, since an iron-related mechanism also might be relevant to neuropathic symptoms in PWH living in low-resource settings today.This time-to-event analysis addressed the impact of systemic iron levels on the rapidity of neuropathy onset in PWH who initiated cART.Soluble transferrin receptor (sTFR), the sTFR-ferritin index of iron stores, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were determined in stored baseline sera from participants of known HFE genotype from AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Study 384, a multicenter randomized clinical trial that evaluated cART strategies. Associations with incident neuropathy were evaluated in proportional-hazards, time-to-event regression models, adjusting for potential confounders.Of 151 eligible participants with stored serum who were included in the original genetic study, 43 had cART-associated neuropathy; 108 had sufficient serum for analysis, including 30 neuropathy cases. Carriers of HFE variants had higher systemic iron (lower sTFR and sTFR-ferritin index) and lower hsCRP levels than non-carriers (all p<0.05). Higher sTFR or iron stores, the HFE 187C>G variant, and lower baseline hsCRP were associated with significantly delayed neuropathy in self-reported whites (n = 28; all p-values<0.05), independent of age, CD4+ T-cell count, plasma HIV RNA, and cART regimen.Higher iron stores, the HFE 187C>G variant, and lower hsCRP predicted delayed onset of neuropathy among self-reported white individuals initating cART. These findings require confirmation but may have implications for cART in HIV+ populations in areas with high endemic iron deficiency, especially those PWH in whom older, more neurotoxic antiretroviral drugs are occasionally still used."
https://openalex.org/W3093281033,"Objectives The aim of our study was to identify HIV-positive patients at risk of medical care interruption (MCI) in a provincial city of a high-income country. Methods We estimated the incidence rate of MCI in 989 individuals followed in an HIV clinic in Caen University Hospital, Normandy, France, between January 2010 and May 2016. We enrolled patients over 18 years old who were seen at the clinic at least twice after HIV diagnosis. Patients were considered to be in MCI if they did not attend care in or outside the clinic for at least 18 months, regardless of whether or not they came back after interruption. We investigated sociodemographic, clinical and immunovirological characteristics at HIV diagnosis and during follow-up through a Cox model analysis. Results The incidence rate of MCI was estimated to be 3.0 per 100 persons-years (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.6-3.5). The independent risk factors for MCI were a linkage to care >6 months after HIV diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.08-1.21), a hepatitis C coinfection (HR = 1.76; 95% CI = 1.07-2.88), being born in Sub-Saharan Africa (HR = 2.18; 95% CI = 1.42-3.34 vs. in France) and not having a mailing address reported in the file (HR = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.07-2.80). During follow-up, the risk of MCI decreased when the patient was older (HR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.15-0.51 when >45 vs. ≤ 30 years old) and increased when the patient was not on antiretroviral therapy (HR = 2.78; 95% CI = 1.66-4.63). Conclusions Our findings show that it is important to link HIV-positive individuals to care quickly after diagnosis and initiate antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible to retain them in care."

Box-score data from six sports [basketball, handball, water polo, field hockey, football, ice hockey] (328 teams, 5723 games, both genders) were standardized by “per ball possession”. We applied Bayesian methods to compute the posterior distributions of shots per possession (SHTpPOS), points per shot (PTSpSHT) and points per possession (PTSpPOS). We evaluated differences for these three variables among sports, between genders and the correlation between every pair of them. Inter-sports evaluation evidenced basketball, handball, ice hockey and water polo are sports with a high probability of creating shots (SHTpPOS—p(robability) > 0.65). Complementary, ice hockey, field hockey and football are sports with a low probability of converting shots (PTSpSHT—0.05 < p < 0.26). Despite the distinct results among sports for creating and converting opportunities, all sports in both genders, converged to a scoring efficiency (PTSpPOS) below 0.5. In the genders’ comparison, men are more efficient in creating opportunities than women, except in water polo. For scoring efficiency, differences between men and women are fewer. Results prevent generalization about differences in scoring efficiency between genders. Finally, creation and conversion have low correlation in sports with high shot creation probabilities (basketball and ice hockey). In these sports, scoring is not limited by the number of shots taken but rather by their accuracy. For sports with low shot creation probabilities (soccer and men field hockey), creation and conversion presented higher correlation. Evidences contribute to increase coaches’ understanding about scoring tactics’ challenges in team sports and design practices accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W3092714997,"Introduction Schizophrenia is believed to be etiologically associated with environmental factors. Poor parental bonding, especially arising from “low care” and “overprotection,” may contribute to the prognosis in patients with psychosis. In the present study, we investigated the associations between the aforementioned two different parental bonding types and the prognosis, in terms of the functional recovery, of patients with schizophrenia. Methods A total of 89 patients with schizophrenia were recruited, and 79 patients were registered for the study. After the parental bonding types and representative childhood adverse events were assessed, specific items on the PANSS were assessed at 0 and 24 weeks of the study period to define the functional prognosis. Results At the end of the 24-week follow-up period, 36% of the patients were judged as showing recovery from schizophrenia. The score for “overprotective attitude,” but not that for “low care,” was found to be significantly higher in the non-recovery (defined below) group. Exploratory logistic regression analysis identified only “overprotective attitude” of the parents as being predictive of non-recovery. Moreover, a significant negative correlation was found between “low care” and “overprotective attitude” only in the non-recovery group. Conclusion In the present study, we showed that an overprotective attitude of the parents was associated with non-recovery in patients with schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W3092978096,"Stereoscopic 3D (S3D) geometric distortions can be introduced by mismatches among image capture, display, and viewing configurations. In previous work of S3D geometric models, geometric distortions have been analyzed from a third-person perspective based on the binocular depth cue (i.e., binocular disparity). A third-person perspective is different from what the viewer sees since monocular depth cues (e.g., linear perspective, occlusion, and shadows) from different perspectives are different. However, depth perception in a 3D space involves both monocular and binocular depth cues. Geometric distortions that are solely predicted by the binocular depth cue cannot describe what a viewer really perceives. In this paper, we combine geometric models and retinal disparity models to analyze geometric distortions from the viewer’s perspective where both monocular and binocular depth cues are considered. Results show that binocular and monocular depth-cue conflicts in a geometrically distorted S3D space. Moreover, user-initiated head translations averting from the optimal viewing position in conventional S3D displays can also introduce geometric distortions, which are inconsistent with our natural 3D viewing condition. The inconsistency of depth cues in a dynamic scene may be a source of visually induced motions sickness."

Sub-optimal adherence to infant prophylaxis has been associated with mother-to-child-transmission of HIV. However, the factors associated have not been well characterised in different settings. This study describes barriers and enablers of adherence to infant prophylaxis among 6-week-old HIV exposed infants in Lira district, Northern Uganda.


Methods 
This prospective cohort study was conducted from 2018–2020 at the PMTCT clinic at Lira Regional Referral Hospital and included 472 mother-infant pairs. HIV-infected pregnant women were recruited, followed up at delivery and 6 weeks postpartum. We used a structured questionnaire to obtain data on socio-demographic, reproductive-related, HIV-related characteristics and adherence. Data were analysed using Stata to estimate adjusted risk ratios using Poisson regression models to ascertain barriers and enablers of adherence to infant nevirapine prophylaxis.


Results 
Barriers to infant adherence are maternal characteristics including: younger age (≤20 years adjusted risk ratio (ARR) = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.1–2.2), missing a viral load test during pregnancy (ARR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1–1.7) and not receiving nevirapine syrup for the baby after childbirth (ARR = 6.2; 95% CI: 5.1–7.6). Enablers were: having attained ≥14 years of schooling (ARR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.5–0.9), taking a nevirapine-based regimen (ARR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4–0.9), long-term ART (≥ 60 months ARR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.6–0.9), accompanied by a husband to hospital during labour and childbirth (ARR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.4–0.7) and labour starting at night (ARR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.6–0.8).


Conclusion and recommendations 
Despite mothers receiving nevirapine syrup from the health workers for the infant, non-adherence rates still prevail at 14.8%. The health system needs to consider giving HIV infected pregnant women the nevirapine syrup before birth to avoid delays and non-adherence. There is need to pay particular attention to younger women and those who recently started ART."
https://openalex.org/W3093273915,"Objectives Unintended (mistimed or unwanted) pregnancies occur frequently in the United States and have negative effects. When designing prevention programs and intervention strategies for the provision of comprehensive birth control methods, it is necessary to identify (1) populations at high risk of unintended pregnancy, and (2) geographic areas with a concentration of need. Methods To estimate the proportion and incidence of unintended births and pregnancies for regions in Missouri, two machine-learning prediction models were developed using data from the National Survey of Family Growth and the Missouri Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Each model was applied to Missouri birth certificate data from 2014 to 2016 to estimate the number of unintended births and pregnancies across regions in Missouri. Population sizes from the American Community Survey were incorporated to estimate the incidence of unintended births and pregnancies. Results About 24,500 (34.0%) of the live births in Missouri each year were estimated to have resulted from unintended pregnancies: about 25 per 1,000 women (ages 15 to 45) annually. Further, 40,000 pregnancies (39.7%) were unintended each year: about 41 per 1,000 women annually. Unintended pregnancy was concentrated in Missouri’s largest urban areas, and annual incidence varied substantially across regions. Conclusions Our proposed methodology was feasible to implement. Random forest modeling identified factors in the data that best predicted unintended birth and pregnancy and outperformed other approaches. Maternal age, marital status, health insurance status, parity, and month that prenatal care began predict unintended pregnancy among women with a recent live birth. Using this approach to estimate the rates of unintended births and pregnancies across regions within Missouri revealed substantial within-state variation in the proportion and incidence of unintended pregnancy. States and other agencies could use this study’s results or methods to better target interventions to reduce unintended pregnancy or address other public health needs."
https://openalex.org/W3093363671,"This research was focused on investigating the effectiveness of galvanic cutaneous stimulation and tactile stimulation jointly and individually at mitigating Simulator Adaptation Syndrome. Forty drivers (mean age = 23.1 ± 3.4 years old, twenty women) participated in a driving simulation experiment. Total scores of the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, head movements (an index of body balance), and driving performance variables were compared across four different stimulation conditions: i) baseline (where no stimulation was presented), ii) galvanic cutaneous stimulation and iii) tactile stimulation deployed individually, and iv) both techniques deployed jointly. The results showed that both techniques presented in conjunction alleviate Simulator Adaptation Syndrome and improve driving performance more effectively than when they are presented in isolation. Importantly, reduced head movements were only revealed when galvanic cutaneous stimulation was applied. We concluded that the reduction of this syndrome is due to an improvement of body balance (elicited by galvanic cutaneous stimulation), and a distraction from the symptoms (elicited by tactile stimulation). We encourage the use of both techniques simultaneously to decrease Simulator Adaptation Syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W3093368634,"CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing often generates founder generation (F0) mice that exhibit somatic mosaicism in the targeted gene(s). It has been known that Fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10)-null mice exhibit limbless and lungless phenotypes, while intermediate limb phenotypes (variable defective limbs) are observed in the Fgf10-CRISPR F0 mice. However, how the lung phenotype in the Fgf10-mosaic mutants is related to the limb phenotype and genotype has not been investigated. In this study, we examined variable lung phenotypes in the Fgf10-targeted F0 mice to determine if the lung phenotype was correlated with percentage of functional Fgf10 genotypes. Firstly, according to a previous report, Fgf10-CRISPR F0 embryos on embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) were classified into three types: type I, no limb; type II, limb defect; and type III, normal limbs. Cartilage and bone staining showed that limb truncations were observed in the girdle, (type I), stylopodial, or zeugopodial region (type II). Deep sequencing of the Fgf10-mutant genomes revealed that the mean proportion of codons that encode putative functional FGF10 was 8.3 ± 6.2% in type I, 25.3 ± 2.7% in type II, and 54.3 ± 9.5% in type III (mean ± standard error of the mean) mutants at E16.5. Histological studies showed that almost all lung lobes were absent in type I embryos. The accessory lung lobe was often absent in type II embryos with other lobes dysplastic. All lung lobes formed in type III embryos. The number of terminal tubules was significantly lower in type I and II embryos, but unchanged in type III embryos. To identify alveolar type 2 epithelial (AECII) cells, known to be reduced in the Fgf10-heterozygous mutant, immunostaining using anti-surfactant protein C (SPC) antibody was performed: In the E18.5 lungs, the number of AECII was correlated to the percentage of functional Fgf10 genotypes. These data suggest the Fgf10 gene dose-related loss of the accessory lobe and decrease in the number of alveolar type 2 epithelial cells in mouse lung. Since dysfunction of AECII cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of parenchymal lung diseases, the Fgf10-CRISPR F0 mouse would present an ideal experimental system to explore it."
https://openalex.org/W3092911938,"The liver is known to possess extensive regenerative capabilities, the processes and pathways of which are not fully understood. A necessary step towards a better understanding involves the analysis of regeneration on the microscopic level in the in vivo environment. We developed an evaluation method combining longitudinal imaging analysis in vivo with simultaneous manipulation on single cell level. An abdominal imaging window was implanted in vivo in Balb/C mice for recurrent imaging after implantation. Intravenous injection of Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC)-Dextran was used for labelling of vessels and Rhodamine 6G for hepatocytes. Minimal cell injury was induced via ablation with a femtosecond laser system during simultaneous visualisation of targeted cells using multiphoton microscopy. High-resolution imaging in vivo on single cell level including re-localisation of ablated regions in follow-up measurements after 2-7 days was feasible. Targeted single cell manipulation using femtosecond laser pulses at peak intensities of 3-6.6 μJ led to enhancement of FITC-Dextran in the surrounding tissue. These reactions reached their maxima 5-15 minutes after ablation and were no longer detectable after 24 hours. The procedures were well tolerated by all animals. Multiphoton microscopy in vivo, combined with a femtosecond laser system for single cell manipulation provides a refined procedure for longitudinal evaluation of liver micro-regeneration in the same region of interest. Immediate reactions after cell ablation and tissue regeneration can be analysed."
https://openalex.org/W3093422660,"Leishmaniasis has been considered as emerging and re-emerging disease, and its increasing global incidence has raised concerns. The great clinical diversity of the disease is mainly determined by the species. In several American countries, tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) is associated with both Leishmania amazonensis and L. braziliensis, while visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is associated with L. (L.) infantum. The major molecules that determine the most diverse biological variations are proteins. In the present study, through a DIGE approach, we identified differentially abundant proteins among the species mentioned above. We observed a variety of proteins with differential abundance among the studied species; and the biological networks predicted for each species showed that many of these proteins interacted with each other. The prominent proteins included the heat shock proteins (HSPs) and the protein network involved in oxide reduction process in L. amazonensis, the protein network of ribosomes in L. braziliensis, and the proteins involved in energy metabolism in L. infantum. The important proteins, as revealed by the PPI network results, enrichment categories, and exclusive proteins analysis, were arginase, HSPs, and trypanothione reductase in L. amazonensis; enolase, peroxidoxin, and tryparedoxin1 in L. braziliensis; and succinyl-CoA ligase [GDP -forming] beta-chain and transaldolase in L. infantum."
https://openalex.org/W3093020289,"Previous studies have suggested an increased risk of cardiac events with azithromycin, but the predictors of such events are unknown. We sought to develop and validate two prediction models to identify such predictors. We used data from Truven Marketscan Database (01/2009 to 06/2015). Using a split-sample approach, we developed two prediction models, which included baseline demographics, clinical conditions (Model 1), concurrent use of any drug (Model 1) and therapeutic class (Model 2) with a risk of QT-prolongation (CQT-Rx). Patients enrolled in a health plan for 365 days before and five days after dispensing of azithromycin (episodes). Cardiac events included syncope, palpitations, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest as a primary diagnosis for hospitalization including death. For each model, a backward elimination of predictors using logistic regression was applied to identify predictors in 100 random samples of the training cohort. Predictors prevalent in >50% of the models were included in the final model. A score for the Assessment of Cardiac Risk with Azithromycin (ACRA) was generated using the training cohort then tested in the validation cohort. A cohort of 20,134,659 episodes with 0.03% cardiac events were included. Over 60% included females with mean age of 40.1±21.3 years. Age, sex, history of syncope, cardiac dysrhythmias, non-specific chest pain, and presence of a CQT-Rx were included as predictors for Model-1 (c-statistic = 0.68). For Model-2 (c-statistic = 0.64), predictors included age, sex, anti-arrhythmic agents, anti-emetics, antidepressants, loop diuretics, and ACE inhibitors. ACRA score is available online (bit.ly/ACRA_2020). The ACRA score may help identify patients who are at higher risk of cardiac events following treatment with azithromycin. Providers should assess the risk-benefit of using azithromycin and consider alternative antibiotics among high-risk patients."
