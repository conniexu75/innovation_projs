We demonstrate that α-synuclein and 20 S proteasome components co-localize in Lewy bodies and show that subunits from 20 S proteasome particles, in contrast to subunits of the 19 S regulatory complex, bind efficiently to aggregated filamentous but not monomeric α-synuclein. Proteasome binding to insoluble α-synuclein filaments and soluble α-synuclein oligomers results in marked inhibition of its chymotrypsin-like hydrolytic activity through a non-competitive mechanism that is mimicked by model amyloid-Aβ peptide aggregates. Endogenous ligands of aggregated α-synuclein like heat shock protein 70 and glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase bind filaments and inhibit their anti-proteasomal activity. The inhibitory effect of amyloid aggregates may thus be amenable to modulation by endogenous chaperones and possibly accessible for therapeutic intervention.

The development of polyubiquitin-containing intracellular inclusions in cell bodies and dystrophic neurites of nerve cells is a key feature of several neurodegenerative disorders, e.g. in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; AS, α-synuclein; DLB, dementia with Lewy bodies; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; HSP70, heat shock protein-70; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SNpc, substantia nigra pars compacta; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Huntington's disease (1Ellison D. Love S. Ellison D. Love S. Neuropathology. Mosby International Ltd., London, UK1998: 28.1-28.6Google Scholar). The polyubiquitination of proteins represents the result of the cellular system that recognizes misfolded or unwanted proteins and tags them for degradation by the proteasome via the sequential action of three enzymes (for a recent review on the ubiquitin-proteasomal system, see Ref. 2Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 82: 373-428Crossref Scopus (3405) Google Scholar). First, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme activates ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent process, after which the activated ubiquitin is passed onto the ubiquitin carrier protein class of ubiquitin conjugates. Then ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases recognize the misfolded proteins and mediate covalent binding of ubiquitin to them. Normally, polyubiquitinated proteins are recognized by the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome that unfolds the substrates and feeds them to the 20 S proteolytic core particle of the 26 S proteasome. The proteasome comprises three hydrolytic activities: the trypsin-like, the chymotrypsin-like, and the caspase-like hydrolytic activities that combined ensure the complete degradation of substrates. Accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is an indicator for an imbalance between the production and ubiquitin labeling of misfolded proteins and the catabolic capacity of the proteasome. A group of neurodegenerative disorders, e.g. PD and DLB, is characterized by the filamentous Lewy body type of cytoplasmic inclusions in the degenerating cells (1Ellison D. Love S. Ellison D. Love S. Neuropathology. Mosby International Ltd., London, UK1998: 28.1-28.6Google Scholar). Aggregates of misfolded α-synuclein (AS) form the filamentous core of the Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (3Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Davies S.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and the aggregates presumably play a role in the degeneration for more reasons. First, the association of missense mutations in AS with autosomal dominant PD shows a direct gain of toxic function for AS in the degenerative process where the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra preferentially are lost (4Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M.

Second, the pathogenic AS mutations, A30P and A53T increase AS propensity for aggregation (6Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P.

Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Likewise, aggregated insoluble AS has been demonstrated in tissue affected by sporadic PD, DLB, and multiple system atrophy (8Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P.H. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q.

Third, the AS filaments in brain tissue resemble those formed in vitro from recombinant human AS that are rich in β-folded structures and both bind Congo Red and thioflavin S (11Serpell L.C.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Accordingly, AS aggregates bear the characteristics of amyloid-type filaments accumulating in other diseases, e.g. formed from tau peptides in Alzheimer's disease and huntingtin in Huntington's disease (3Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Davies S.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The employment of animal models corroborates the involvement of aggregated AS in the neurodegenerative process where overexpression of AS leads to abnormal AS accumulation, misfolding, neuronal dysfunction, and overt degeneration (10Kahle P.J. Neumann M. Ozmen L. Muller V. Odoy S. Okamoto N. Jacobsen H. Iwatsubo T. Trojanowski J.Q. Takahashi H. Wakabayashi K. Bogdanovic N. Riederer P. Kretzschmar H.A. Haass C. Am. J.

A compromised proteasomal function in the substantia nigra in PD has been reported (16McNaught K.S. Jenner P. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 17McNaught K.S. Olanow C.W. Halliwell B. Isacson O. Jenner P. Nat. Rev.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44405-44411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and this may be due to a direct effect of AS on the proteasome as transgenic cellular expression of AS inhibits the proteasome (21Stefanis L. Larsen K.E. Rideout H.J. Sulzer D. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9549-9560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tanaka Y. Engelender S. Igarashi S. Rao R.K. Wanner T. Tanzi R.E. Sawa A.L. Dawson V.

Cookson M.R. Neuron. 2002; 36: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Most important, aggregated AS displayed a strongly increased inhibitory activity toward the proteasome in vitro as compared with monomeric AS (24Snyder H. Mensah K. Theisler C. Lee J. Matouschek A. Wolozin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11753-11759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Such a proteasomal inhibition may have an impact on the dopaminergic neurons that seem to be particularly vulnerable to the stress of unfolded proteins (23Petrucelli L. O'Farrell C. Lockhart P.J. Baptista M. Kehoe K. Vink L. Choi P. Wolozin B. Farrer M. Hardy J. Cookson M.R. Neuron. 2002; 36: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that AS, ubiquitin, and 20 S proteasomal components co-localize in Lewy bodies, and we show that aggregated but not monomeric AS binds efficiently to the 20 S proteasome part of the 26 S proteasome. The proteasome binding results in an efficient and selective non-competitive inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like proteasomal activity of the 20 S proteolytic particle. This inhibition, which is mimicked by Aβ amyloid filaments, is reverted by the amyloid targeting substances thioflavin S and Congo Red. Moreover, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) that protects neurons toward AS-mediated toxicity in transgenic models (25Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) bind to the AS filaments and abrogate their anti-proteasomal activity. Finally, subjecting cells to heat shock renders their cytosolic proteasomes less sensitive to the toxicity of aggregated AS thus demonstrating a potential for modulation of this toxicity by endogenous factors. The proteasomal inhibition by aggregated AS may represent a common neurodegenerative mechanism in diseases like PD, DLB, and multiple system atrophy where the degenerating cells accumulate AS aggregates. Abolition of the inhibition may open for new neuroprotective strategies. Miscellaneous and Proteins—All chemicals were of analytical grade if not otherwise stated. Thioflavin S and Congo Red were from Sigma. Human 20 S proteasome was isolated from human erythrocytes by affinity chromatography on immobilized MCP21 monoclonal antibody (26Hendil K.B. Uerkvitz W. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1991; 22: 155-165Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The specific activities of the 20 S proteasome are as follows: chymotrypsin-like activity, 4.0 nmol/min/mg protein using succinyl-Ala-Ala-Phe-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; trypsin-like activity, 5.1 nmol/min/mg protein using Z-Ala-Ala-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarine; caspase-like activity, 1.9 nmol/min/mg protein using Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-β-naphthylamide. The Aβ-(1-40) peptide was from (Schaefer-N., Copenhagen, Denmark). Recombinant human HSP70 was from Stressgen, (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), and GAPDH was from Sigma. Both GAPDH and HSP70 were centrifuged for 30 min at 120,000 rpm at 4 °C in a TLA 120.1 rotor in a Optima TLX centrifuge (Beckman Instruments) to remove any aggregated materials prior to pull-down experiments. Recombinant human full-length AS-(1-140), C-terminally truncated AS-(1-95), and β-synuclein were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (27Jensen P.H. Højrup P. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Jakobsen L. Olesen O.F. Gliemann J. Jakes R. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 28Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), followed by an additional reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography purification step on a Jupiter C18 column (Phenomenex) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with an acetonitrile gradient. The proteins were subsequently aliquoted, lyophilized, and stored at -80 °C. Primary Antibodies—Sheep anti-AS was affinity-purified as described (29Gai W.P. Power J.H.T. Blumbergs P.C. Jensen P.H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2093-2100PubMed Google Scholar) and obtained from Abcam, UK. Rabbit ASY-1 IgG was raised against full-length human recombinant AS (28Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Rabbit FILA-1 IgG, specific for aggregated AS, was prepared by immunizing rabbits with sucrose density gradient-purified AS-(1-140) filaments. The immune serum was subsequently passed several times through a column with immobilized AS. This ensured the removal of all detectable immunoreactivity toward monomeric AS as determined by dot blotting. The serum lacking the monomer binding antibodies was then incubated with density gradient purified AS filaments, and the aggregate-binding antibodies were isolated by gradient co-sedimentation with the filaments. The antibodies were subsequently eluted from the filaments by incubation in 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, followed by gradient centrifugation to separate the insoluble AS filaments from the FILA-1 IgG. The IgG was finally concentrated by protein A chromatography. The monoclonal antibodies, used to detect 20 S proteasome subunits, are as follows: MCP72 (α7 subunit); MCP196 (α5 subunit); MCP20 (α6 subunit); MCP231 (α2, α3, α6, α7 subunits); MCP421 (β1 subunit) (30Kristensen P. Johnsen A.H. Uerkvitz W. Tanaka K. Hendil K.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies to subunits of the 19 S regulatory proteasome complex are as follows: p31-38 (S14/Rpn12 subunit); S5a-18 (S5a/Rpn10 subunit); TBP1-19 (S6′/Rpt5 subunit) (31Hendil K.B. Hartmann-Petersen R. Tanaka K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to S6′ (Affinity Bioreagents) was also used as were affinity-purified rabbit anti-ubiquitin (Dako, Denmark) and monoclonal antibodies against HSP70 (clone BRM-22) and β-actin (both from Sigma). Immunohistochemistry—Samples of substantia nigra from sporadic PD (n = 4), DLB (n = 3), and control subjects (n = 4) were obtained from the Netherlands Brain Bank (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Control samples were obtained among patients without neurological disease and with no pathological changes in sections of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The diagnosis of PD in the human autopsies was based on loss of neuromelanin pigment and the excessive number of Lewy bodies in the remaining SNpc neurons in the eosin-stained section. The paraffin sections were cut at 2 μm and subjected to immunohistochemistry as described previously (32Mirza B. Hadberg H. Thomsen P. Moos T. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Complementary sections were demelanized using successive incubations with 0.25% potassium permanganate for 20 min followed by 1% oxalic acid and 1% potassium bisulfite for 4 min (33Leveugle B. Faucheux B.A. Bouras C. Nillesse N. Spik G. Hirsch E.C. Agid Y. Hof P.R. Acta Neuropathol. 1996; 91: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit anti-human ubiquitin diluted 1:500 (Dako, DK), sheep anti-human AS diluted 1:200 (Abcam, UK), or anti-human 20 S proteasome antibody MCP20. The sections were developed using 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. To examine the extent of nonspecific binding, non-immune sera were substituted for the primary antibody. The relative ratio between the presence of AS and 20 S proteasome in Lewy bodies was estimated by staining four pairs of sections per autopsy for AS and 20 S proteasome, which were counted for their content of positive Lewy bodies. Immunolabeling of Isolated Lewy Bodies—Immunohistochemical staining was conducted in isolated Lewy bodies from fresh frozen brains of patients with DLB. The cingulate cortex from five DLB cases were analyzed. The isolation procedure was modified from Refs. 28Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol.

Neurol. 2000; 166: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar with the Lewy body smears prepared by washing the Lewy body enriched fraction three times in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) followed by smearing on gelatin-coated glass slides and air-drying for 2 h at room temperature. The smears were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in TBS for 10 min and then incubated with 3% H2O2 in 50% methanol/TBS for 10 min to bleach endogenous peroxidase activity. Following three 5-min rinse in TBS, the smears were blocked with 20% normal horse serum for 30 min and then incubated for 60 min in primary antibody solution containing monoclonal antibody MCP72 (1:300) or MCP196 (1:300). To facilitate recognizing Lewy bodies, the primary antibody solution also included sheep anti-AS (1:300) or anti-ubiquitin (1:300). The smears were rinsed three times in TBS and then labeled for 60 min with Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, in combination with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG or Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (all used 1:100 dilution, all from Jackson ImmunoResearch). The primary and secondary antibody dilutions used above were predetermined by serial titrations before formal experiments. Controls for antibody specificity included omitting primary or secondary antibodies and preabsorption the primary antibody with ubiquitin or AS. Lewy body staining was not detected in these control experiments. The smears were examined using a Bio-Rad confocal laser scanning microscope and software package (Bio-Rad MRC 1024) (34Gai W.P. Yuan H.X. Li X.Q. Power J.T.H. Blumbergs P.C. Jensen P.H. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 166: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) with the scanned image representing an ∼1-μm thick slice through the center or equatorial plane of the Lewy body. Preparation of AS Aggregates—AS aggregates were made by resuspending lyophilized AS in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.02% NaN3 at 7 mg/ml followed by ultracentrifugation to remove insoluble aggregates (28Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Incubation of β-synuclein (5.5 mg/ml) and Aβ-(1-40) peptide (4 mg/ml) was performed by analogous procedures. The supernatant was incubated at 37 °C on a shaker for ∼14 days. Insoluble AS aggregates were isolated for proteasome activity assays and electron microscopy by sedimentation through a 40% sucrose cushion (28Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) followed by resuspension in the buffer of choice. Soluble AS aggregates were isolated by gel filtration of the soluble supernatant, obtained after ultracentrifugation of the aggregated AS sample, on a 24 × 1-cm Bio-Gel A 1.5M column (Bio-Rad) in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4 (PBS), at 0.5 ml/min. The buffer was changed to 1 m Hepes, pH 8.0, when isolating soluble oligomers for the proteasome activity assay. The elution of the aggregated oligomers was determined by dot-blotting of the eluted fractions using the FILA-1 antibody, and the total AS was monitored by probing the membrane with the ASY-1 antibody. Electron Microscopy—Electron microscopy was used to analyze the insoluble AS filaments and to visualize the binding of purified 20 S proteasomes to the filaments. Filaments isolated from 30 μl of aggregated AS (7 mg/ml) were resuspended in 30 μl of PBS supplemented 20 mm NaN3 after pelleting through the sucrose cushion as described above. Purified 20 S proteasome was centrifuged for 10 min at 100,000 rpm at 4 °C in a TLA 120.1 rotor in an Optima TLX centrifuge (Beckman Instruments) to remove aggregated materials. Soluble 20 S proteasome (40 μl at 0.18 mg/ml) was incubated together with 5 μl of resuspended AS filaments (5 mg/ml) for 2 h at 25 °C. Non-bound proteasome was removed by sucrose gradient centrifugation of the filaments with bound 20 S proteasome. The sedimented filaments with attached 20 S proteasome was resuspended in 70 μl of distilled water. Filaments not incubated with 20 S proteasomes before the centrifugation and soluble 20 S proteasomes diluted to 0.16 mg/ml in PBS before direct application to the grid were used as control. All samples were pipetted onto carbon-coated nickel grids (3 μl for each grid) and allowed to stand for 2 min. The samples were stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 min. The grids were then air-dried and examined in a Morgagni 268, 80-kV electron microscope, and photographs were taken at 14,000, 18,000, or 22,000 times magnification. For immunogold labeling, grids with samples were blocked with blocking buffer (PBS with 0.05 m glycine and 0.1% milk protein) for 10 min and incubated with the primary antibody MCP72 (0.07 mg/ml) for 1 h. The grids were then washed three times for 5 min with blocking buffer and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 5-nm diameter gold particles (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:100 in PBS with 1% fish gelatin, 0.06% polyethylene glycol, and 0.1% milk protein for 1 h. The grids were then washed twice for 5 min in PBS with 0.1% milk protein and then twice for 5 min in water. The grids were finally stained and examined as the non-immunolabeled samples. Filament Pull-down Assay—Cellular cytosol was prepared from primary cultures of normal human skin fibroblasts (35Rattan S.I. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 45: 753-759PubMed Google Scholar) and from rat brain (36Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Cells, at confluence, were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The cells were sonicated in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 8, 0.5 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol (5 ml for three 75-cm2 flasks) on ice. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 108,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C giving a cytosol of 1 mg of protein/ml. To demonstrate the binding to AS filaments, 250 μl of cytosol were incubated with 70 μg of AS filaments for 1.5 h at 37 °C; 30 μg of GAPDH were incubated with 9 μg of AS filaments for 16 h at 4 °C; HSP70 (1.2 μg) were incubated with 21 μg of AS filaments for 2 h at 25 °C; purified 20 S (5.4 μg) were incubated with 70 μg of AS filaments for 16 h at 4 °C. All volumes were adjusted to 300 μl with 20 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, except for the HSP70, where the buffer was 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol and 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.2. As negative controls cytosol, GAPDH, HSP70, 20 S proteasomes, or filaments were treated as above but without mixing the individual proteins. As positive controls, cytosol, GAPDH, HSP70, 20 S proteasome, or the filaments were loaded directly on the SDS-PAGE. Excess of purified monomeric AS was supplemented to the ligand-filament samples to determine whether this would inhibit the association of the ligands to the filaments or the interaction displayed a selectivity for the filaments as demonstrated by an unchanged amount of ligand in the pellet. The filament pull-down assay was performed by placing the protein samples on a cushion of 1.6 ml of 40% sucrose, 13 mm MES, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, followed by centrifugation at 55,000 rpm for 30 min in a TLS 55 swing out rotor at 4 °C in a Optima TLX centrifuge (Beckman Instruments). The pellets were either recovered for the proteasome assay by resuspension in 1 m Hepes, pH 8.0, or solubilized in 30 μl of 8 m urea with 4% SDS for 16 h in 37 °C. The latter was used to ensure complete depolymerization of the filaments. Non-bound proteins, remaining in the supernatant, were analyzed by the precipitation of 500 μl of the supernatant in trichloroacetic acid. The solubilized pellets and the precipitated supernatants were dissolved in dithioerythritol-containing SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated 95 °C for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by analysis with staining of the gel by silver or Coomassie Blue or by immunoblotting (28Jensen P.H.

Proteasome Assay—Approximately 80% confluent fibroblasts were scraped into 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 (1 ml per 75-cm2 flask). The cells were placed on ice for 15 min to allow lysis. The cytosolic extract was subsequently harvested as the supernatant after a centrifugation at 11,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For the proteasome assay, the cytosol was used at a concentration of 100 μg of protein/ml and the purified human erythrocyte 20 S proteasome at a concentration of 2 μg of protein/ml. The hydrolytic activity for the chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like hydrolytic activities were determined as described previously (37Fonager J. Beedholm R. Clark B.F. Rattan S.I. Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 1223-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The coefficient of variation for the proteasome assay ranged from 0.8 to 6.3% in six independent experiments with the mean being 3%. Proteasome enzyme activities were calculated as the difference in activity measured in the absence and in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, and in some experiments the peptide aldehyde Z-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG132), both being potent inhibitors of primarily of the chymotrypsin-like activity. All the activity measurements were done in duplicate or triplicate from independent samples, as stated in the legends. Fluorescence of cleavage products from peptide substrate was measured on a Kontron SFM 25 spectrofluorometer. The effect of aggregated and non-aggregated AS on the proteasomal activity was determined by incubating proteasomes with AS for 60 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of the fluorogenic substrate. Localization of 20 S Components in Lewy Bodies—Lewy bodies denote the characteristic inclusion bodies of PD and DLB (38McKeith I.G. Galasko D. Kosaka K. Perry E.K. Dickson D.W. Hansen L.A.

Labeling of Lewy bodies by the anti-ubiquitin, anti-AS, and anti-proteasome 20 S antibodies was mainly confined to their peripheral zone (Fig. 1, A-C). Immunolabeling was not observed in nigral neurons when the primary antibody was omitted from the immunoreaction (Fig. 1D).

In the present study, we showed that CXCL12 enhanced the chemotaxis, chemoinvasion and adhesive properties of breast cancer cells; parameters that are critical for development of metastasis. We have also evaluated the signaling mechanisms that regulate CXCL12-induced and CXCR4-mediated breast cancer cell motility and invasion. These studies revealed that CXCL12 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at residues 397 and 577, and of RAFTK/Pyk2 at residues 402 and 579/580. The cytoskeletal proteins paxillin and Crk, as well as tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and adaptor protein Cbl, were also phosphorylated. CXCL12 induced the activation of PI 3-kinase, and increased its association with Cbl and SHP2. PI 3-kinase, RAFTK/Pyk2 and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors significantly blocked CXCL12-induced chemotaxis and chemoinvasion. The role of SHP2 and Cbl in CXCL12-induced chemotaxis and chemoinvasion in breast cancer cells was further defined by transiently overexpressing wild-type SHP2, wild-type Cbl, dominant-negative SHP2, Cbl mutants 70Z/3 and G306E or double transfectants of the Cbl and SHP2 constructs. We found a novel role of Cbl in CXCL12-induced chemotaxis, which may be mediated through the activation and formation of a multimeric complex comprised of Cbl, SHP2 and PI 3-kinase. We also observed the activation of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 upon CXCL12 stimulation. These studies provide new information regarding signaling pathways that may regulate CXCL12-induced metastasis in breast cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2138457121,"The ArcB/ArcA two-component signal transduction system of <i>Escherichia coli</i> regulates gene expression in response to the redox conditions of growth. Over the years, genetic screens have lead to the identification of about 30 ArcA-P-controlled operons that are involved in redox metabolism. However, the discovery of 3 targets that are not implicated in respiratory metabolism (the <i>tra</i> operon for plasmid conjugation, <i>psi</i> site for Xer-based recombination, and <i>oriC</i> site for chromosome replication) suggests that the Arc modulon may comprise additional operons that are involved in a myriad of functions. To identify these operons, we derived the ArcA-P-dependent transcription profile of <i>E. coli</i> using oligonucleotide-based microarray analysis. The findings indicated that 9% of all open reading frames in <i>E. coli</i> are affected either directly or indirectly by ArcA-P. To identify which operons are under the direct control of ArcA-P, we developed the ArcA-P recognition weight matrix from footprinting data and used it to scan the genome, yielding an ArcA-P sequence affinity map. By overlaying both methods, we identified 55 new Arc-regulated operons that are implicated in energy metabolism, transport, survival, catabolism, and transcriptional regulation. The data also suggest that the Arc response pathway, which translates into a net global downscaling of gene expression, overlaps partly with the FNR regulatory network. A conservative but reasonable assessment is that the Arc pathway recruits 100–150 operons to mediate a role in cellular adaptation that is more extensive than hitherto anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W2125558097,"Because of the critical role of the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB in inflammation, viral replication, carcinogenesis, antiapoptosis, invasion, and metastasis, specific inhibitors of this nuclear factor are being sought and tested as treatments. NF-κB activation is known to require p65 phosphorylation at serine residues 276, 529, and 536 before it undergoes nuclear translocation. Small protein domains, termed protein transduction domains (PTDs), which are able to penetrate cell membranes can be used to transport other proteins across the cell membrane. We have identified two peptides from the p65 subunit of NF-κB (P1 and P6 were from amino acid residues 271–282 and 525–537, respectively) that, when linked with a PTD derived from the third helix sequence of antennapedia, inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced NF-κB activation in vivo. Linkage to the PTD was not, however, required to suppress the binding of the p50-p65-heterodimer to the DNA in vitro. PTD-p65-P1 had no effect on TNF-induced AP-1 activation. PTD-p65-P1 suppressed NF-κB activation induced by lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1, okadaic acid, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, H2O2, and cigarette smoke condensate as well as that induced by TNF. PTD-p65-P1 had no effect on TNF-induced inhibitory subunit of NF-κB(IκBα) phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, or IκBα kinase activation, but it blocked TNF-induced p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. NF-κB-regulated reporter gene expression induced by TNF, TNF receptor 1, TNF receptor-associated death domain, TNF receptor-associated factor-2, NF-κB-inducing kinase, IκBα kinase, and p65 was also suppressed by these peptides. Suppression of NF-κB by PTD-p65-P1 enhanced the apoptosis induced by TNF and chemotherapeutic agents. Overall, our results demonstrate the identification of a p65 peptide that can selectively inhibit NF-κB activation induced by various inflammatory stimuli, down-regulate NF-κB-mediated gene expression, and up-regulate apoptosis.

Overall, our results demonstrate the identification of a p65 peptide that can selectively inhibit NF-κB activation induced by various inflammatory stimuli, down-regulate NF-κB-mediated gene expression, and up-regulate apoptosis. NF-κB represents a group of five proteins, namely c-Rel, RelA (p65), RelB, NF-κB1 (p50 and p105), and NF-κB2 (p52) (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). Ways to modulate NF-κB expression therapeutically have focused on its active-inactive state transition mechanisms. NF-κB is regulated by a family of inhibitors, called IκB 1The abbreviations used are: IκB, inhibitory subunit of NF-κB; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR1, TNF receptor 1; IKK, IκBα kinase; TRAF2, TNF receptor-associated factor-2; TRADD, TNF receptor-associated death domain; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay(s); SEAP, secretory alkaline phosphatase; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate; PTD, protein transduction domain(s); MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; COX, cyclooxygenase. (2Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109 (suppl.): 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). In an inactive state, NF-κB is present in the cytoplasm as a heterotrimer consisting of p50, p65, and IκBα subunits. In response to an activation signal, the IκBα subunit is phosphorylated at serine residues 32 and 36, ubiquitinated at lysine residues 21 and 22, and degraded through the proteosomal pathway, thus exposing the nuclear localization signals on the p50-p65 heterodimer. The p65 is then phosphorylated, leading to the nuclear translocation and binding to a specific sequence in DNA, which in turn results in transcriptions of various genes including cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. NF-κB has been shown to regulate the expression of a number of genes whose products are involved in inflammation, viral replication, carcinogenesis, antiapoptosis, invasion, and metastasis (3Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar, 4Garg A. Aggarwal B.B. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1053-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Specific adhesion molecule, chemokine, inflammatory cytokine, and cell cycle regulatory gene are affected. Thus, agents that can suppress NF-κB activation have the potential to be treatments for inflammatory diseases and cancer (4Garg A. Aggarwal B.B.

Recent studies, however, indicate that certain short protein sequences can enter the cells without any receptors, and these have been named protein transduction domain (PTD) peptides (10Lindgren M.

We designed specific inhibitors of NF-κB activation based on the phosphorylation sites present in the p65. To permit the inhibitor to cross the cell membrane, the synthetic p65 peptide was linked with a protein transduction peptide, a short protein sequence that can enter cells without any receptors (10Lindgren M.

Specifically, we linked the peptide to an antennapedia-derived PTD and investigated its ability to inhibit NF-κB activation in vitro and in vivo and explored its mechanism of action. We report the identification of a novel peptide that suppressed NF-κB activation induced by a variety of inflammatory stimuli and NF-κB-mediated gene transcription and enhanced apoptosis induced by TNF and other apoptotic stimuli. Reagents—Bacteria-derived human recombinant TNF, purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 5 × 107 units/mg, was kindly provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Penicillin, streptomycin, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Lipopolysaccharide, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), okadaic acid, H2O2, and anti-β-actin antibody were obtained from Sigma. The cigarette smoke condensate was kindly provided by Dr. C. Gary Gariola (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY). The polyclonal antibodies anti-p65, anti-p50, anti-IκBα, anti-cyclin D1, and MMP-9 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphospecific anti-IκBα (Ser32) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Phosphospecific anti-p65 antibody was kindly provided by Rockland Laboratory (Rockland, MD). Anti-IKK-α and anti-IKK-β antibodies were kindly provided by Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Anti-COX-2 antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Purified recombinant NF-κB p65 protein expressed in bacteria (lot 00903001) was kindly provided by Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). Cell Lines—We used the leukemic cell line KBM-5, which is phenotypically myeloid with monocytic differentiation and A 293 embryonic kidney cells. KBM-5 cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, and A 293 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Peptide Synthesis—All peptides (see Fig. 1) were synthesized using an automated peptide synthesizer (Symphony Multiplex, Rainin Instruments, MA). The peptides were purified to more than 90% purity using high pressure liquid chromatography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—To measure NF-κB activation, we performed EMSA as described previously (44Chaturvedi M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol.

Briefly, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells (1 × 106/ml) were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotides (10 μg of protein with 16 fmol of DNA) from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat, 5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′ (boldface type indicates NF-κB binding sites) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the DNA-protein complex formed was separated from free oligonucleotides on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide, 5′-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′, was used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-κB to the DNA. The specificity of binding was also examined by competition with the unlabeled oligonucleotides. To investigate the binding of recombinant p65 to DNA, poly(dI-dC) was excluded from the binding reaction buffer. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells were incubated with antibodies against either the p50 or p65 subunits of NF-κB for 30 min at 37 °C, and then the complex was analyzed by EMSA. Antibodies against cyclin D1 and preimmune serum were included as negative controls. The dried gels were visualized, and radioactive bands were quantitated by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) using ImageQuant software. Western Blot Analysis—To determine the levels of protein expression in the cytoplasm or the nucleus, we prepared extracts (46Takada Y. Mukhopadhyay A. Kundu G.C. Mahabeleshwar G.H. Singh S.

After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with each antibody, and detected by ECL regent (Amersham Biosciences). IKK Assay—The IKK assay was performed by a method described previously (47Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3278-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Briefly, IKK complex from whole-cell extract was precipitated with antibody against IKK-α, followed by treatment with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). After a 2-h incubation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and then assayed in kinase assay mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 2 μg of substrate GST-IκBα (residues 1–54). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by boiling with SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Finally, the protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were visualized by a PhosphorImager. To determine the total amounts of IKK-α and IKK-β in each sample, 30 μg of the whole-cell protein was resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then blotted with either anti-IKK-α or anti-IKK-β antibodies. Cell-free phosphorylation of peptide by IKK was also determined using 10 μg of peptides as a substrate in the kinase reaction mixture as described above and then fractionated on 20% SDS-PAGE in 2× SDS electrophoresis buffer. NF-κB-dependent Reporter Secretory Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP) Expression Assay—The effect of inhibitory peptides on TNF-, TNFR-, TRADD-, TRAF2-, NF-κB-inducing kinase-, IKK-, and p65-induced NF-κB-dependent reporter gene transcription was analyzed by SEAP assay as previously described (48Ashikawa K. Majumdar S. Banerjee S. Bharti A.C. Shishodia S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6490-6497Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, A 293 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 6-well plates and transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate method with pNF-κB-SEAP (0.5 μg). To examine TNF-induced reporter gene expression, we transfected the cells with 0.5 μg of the SEAP expression plasmid and 2 μg of the control plasmid pCMVFLAG1 DNA for 24 h. Thereafter, the cells were treated for 24 h with 150 μm peptides and then stimulated with 1 nm TNF for 24 h. The cell culture medium was then harvested and analyzed for alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activity according to the protocol essentially as described by the manufacturer (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using a 96-well fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroscan II, Labsystems, Chicago, IL) with excitation set at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. Cytotoxicity Assay (MTT Assay)—The cytotoxic effects of TNF were determined by the MTT uptake method as described (47Takada Y. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3278-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5000 cells were incubated with synthetic peptides for 1 h in triplicate in 96-well plates and then treated with various concentrations of TNF for 72 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, MTT solution was added to each well. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, extraction buffer (20% SDS, 50% dimethylformamide) was added, the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and then the optical density was measured at 570 nm using a 96-well multiscanner (MRX Revelation; Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Cytotoxicity Assay (Live/Dead® Assay)—The cytotoxic effects of TNF were also determined by the Live/Dead® assay (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were incubated with 100 μm PTD-p65-P1 for 1 h and then treated with 1 nm TNF for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were stained with Live/Dead® reagent (5 μm ethidium homodimer, 5 μm calcein-AM) and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). TUNEL Assay—The TNF-induced apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay using In Situ Cell Death Detection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were incubated with PTD-p65-P1 for 1 h and then treated with 1 nm TNF for 16 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, cells were plated on a poly-l-lysine-coated glass slide by centrifugation using a Cytospin 4 centrifuge (Thermoshendon, Pittsburgh, PA), airdried, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate. After washing, cells were incubated with reaction mixture for 60 min in 37 °C. Stained cells were mounted with mounting medium purchased from Sigma and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Labophot-2). To design a peptide that can suppress NF-κB activation, we targeted the phosphorylation sites of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. The p65 consists of a DNA-binding and dimerization domain (RHD in Fig. 1; residues 191–290), nuclear localization domain (NLS; residues 291–325), and transactivation domain (TAD). The phosphorylation residue Ser276 present in the DNA-binding and dimerization domain and Ser529 and Ser536 present in the transactivation domain were targeted (see Fig. 1A). The p65 peptides listed in Fig. 1 were linked with the PTD derived from the third helix of the antennapedia homeodomain (Fig. 1B). These peptides were tested for their ability to suppress NF-κB activation induced by various proinflammatory stimuli. Specific Amino Acid Sequence Is Required for Suppression of NF-κB Activation in Vitro—We used the in vitro assay to determine the amino acid sequence needed for NF-κB activation (Fig. 2A). The p65-derived peptides in which Ser276 was mutated (p65-P2) did not inhibit NF-κB binding to the DNA. Peptides in which 5 amino acid residues from the C terminus (QLRRP, SD; p65-P4) or QLR-deleted (RP, SDREL, SE; p65-P5), were also inactive. The minimum peptide required for suppression of NF-κB activation was QLRRPSDRELSE (p65-P1). Whether p65-P6 can suppress the p50-p65 binding to the DNA was examined. Peptides in which Ser529 was mutated (p65-P7) or Ser536 was mutated (p65-P8) did not inhibit NF-κB binding to the DNA (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that the inhibition of TNF-induced NF-κB activation by p65-P6 requires the presence of both of the phosphorylation sites, Ser529 and Ser536. In contrast, p65-P1 contains a single phosphorylation site, and it is needed to inhibit NF-κB activity. All subsequent studies were performed with PTD-p65-P1. Whether the p65-derived peptides also inhibit the binding of recombinant p65 protein to the DNA was investigated. To determine this, the recombinant purified p65 protein was incubated with various peptides and then examined for DNA binding. The p65-P1 and p65-P6 peptides, whether linked with or without PTD, inhibited the binding of recombinant p65 to the DNA in the same manner as natural p65/p50-NF-κB complex (Fig. 2B). The dose-dependent effects of PTD-p65-P1 and p65-P1 on the p50-p65 binding to the DNA were investigated. Nuclear extracts from TNF-treated cells were incubated with different concentrations of the peptide and then examined for DNA binding. The p65-P1 inhibited NF-κB binding in a dose-dependent manner, and maximum inhibition occurred at 50 μm (Fig. 2C). PTD-p65-P1 also inhibited NF-κB binding at the same concentration. PTD alone had no effect. PTD-p65-P1 Inhibits TNF-induced NF-κB Activation in Vivo—To determine the effect of the peptide containing Ser276 (PTD-p65-P1), we preincubated KBM-5 cells with the peptides for 1 h and then treated them with 0.1 nm TNF for the indicated times. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and we then analyzed NF-κB activation by EMSA (Fig. 3A). TNF induced NF-κB activation in a time-dependent manner, and pretreatment with PTD-p65-P1 completely abolished the TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Neither PTD nor p65-P1 alone had any effect on TNF-induced NF-κB activation, indicating that p65-P1 must be attached to a PTD for it to enter the membrane. We also investigated the minimum dose of PTD-p65-P1 required to suppress NF-κB activation. PTD-p65-P1 suppressed TNF-induced NF-κB activation by 25% at 100 μm and completely at 150 μm (Fig. 3B). PTD-p65-P6 Also Inhibits TNF-induced NF-κB Activation in Vivo—To determine the effect of the peptide containing Ser529 and Ser536 (PTD-p65-P6), we preincubated KBM-5 cells with various concentrations of peptides for 1 h and then treated them with 0.1 nm TNF for 30 min. PTD-p65-P6 inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner. Neither PTD nor p65-P6 alone had any effect on TNF-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 3C). These results indicated that both Ser539 and Ser536 were important for inhibiting NF-κB activation. Specificity of PTD-p65-P1 Inhibiting Activity—Various combinations of Rel/NF-κB protein can constitute an active NF-κB heterodimer that binds to a specific sequence in the DNA (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). To show that the retarded band visualized by EMSA in TNF-treated cells was indeed NF-κB, we incubated nuclear extracts from TNF-stimulated cells with antibodies to either the p50 (NF-κB1) or the p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-κB. Both shifted the band to a higher molecular mass (Fig. 3D), thus suggesting that the TNF-activated complex consisted of p50 and p65 subunits. Furthermore, 50 μm p65-P1 inhibited the formation of the higher molecular mass band. Neither preimmune serum nor the irrelevant antibody anti-cyclin D1 had any effect. Excess unlabeled NF-κB (100-fold; competitor) caused complete disappearance of the band, but mutant oligonucleotides did not. TNF-induced AP-1 Activation Is Not Inhibited by PTD-p65-P1—Like NF-κB, TNF is a potent activator of AP-1 (49Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). Whether PTD-p65-P1 affects TNF-induced AP-1 activation was also investigated. Cells were treated with 0.1 nm TNF for the indicated times, and nuclear extracts were prepared and assayed for AP-1 activation by EMSA (Fig. 4A). TNF activated AP-1, but PTD-p65-P1 had no effect on the activation of AP-1. PTD-p65-P1 Inhibits NF-κB Activation Induced by Different Activators—Lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1, okadaic acid, PMA, H2O2, and cigarette smoke condensate are potent activators of NF-κB, but the mechanisms differ (3Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar, 4Garg A. Aggarwal B.B. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1053-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). We investigated whether PTD-p65-P1 could suppress NF-κB activated by these agents. Cells were preincubated with 150 μm PTD-p65-P1 for 1 h, treated with 0.1 nm TNF, 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide, 100 ng/ml interleukin-1, 500 nm okadaic acid, 10 ng/ml PMA, 500 μm H2O2, or 1 μg/ml cigarette smoke condensate and then analyzed for NF-κB activation by EMSA. PTD-p65-P1 suppressed the activation of NF-κB induced by all of these agents (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the PTD-p65-P1 acts at a step common to all of these agents. PTD-p65-P1 and PTD-p65-P6 Have No Effect on IκBα Phosphorylation or Degradatio"
https://openalex.org/W2075482214,"The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein Survivin is expressed in most cancers and is a key factor in maintaining apoptosis resistance. Although several IAPs have been shown to act as direct inhibitors of caspases, the precise antiapoptotic function of Survivin remains controversial. To clarify the mechanism by which Survivin protects cells, we investigated the kinetics of apoptosis and apoptotic events following Survivin inhibition utilizing a melanoma cell line harboring a tetracycline-regulated Survivin dominant-negative mutant (Survivin-T34A). Blocking Survivin resulted in both caspase activation and apoptosis; however, the level of apoptosis was only partially reduced by caspase inhibition. Survivin blockade also resulted in mitochondrial events that preceded caspase activation, including depolarization and release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO. Levels of other IAPs were not altered in Survivin-targeted cells, although modest cleavage of XIAP and Livin was observed. The earliest proapoptotic event observed in Survivin-targeted cells was nuclear translocation of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), known to trigger both apoptotic mitochondrial events and caspase-independent DNA fragmentation. These findings suggest that a key antiapoptotic function of Survivin relates to inhibition of mitochondrial and AIF-dependent apoptotic pathways, and its expression in melanoma and other cancers likely protects against both caspase-independent and -dependent apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2056772835,"β-Arrestin2 not only plays essential roles in seven membrane-spanning receptor desensitization and internalization but also functions as a signal transducer in mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. Here we show that the angiotensin II type 1A receptor-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in HEK-293 cells is increased when the cellular level of β-arrestin1 is down-regulated by RNA interference but is decreased or eliminated when the cellular level of β-arrestin2 is diminished. Such reciprocal effects of down-regulated levels of β-arrestins 1 and 2 are primarily due to differences in the ability of the two forms of β-arrestins to directly mediate ERK activation. These results are the first to demonstrate reciprocal activity of β-arrestin isoforms on a signaling pathway and suggest that physiological levels of β-arrestin1 may act as ""dominant-negative"" inhibitors of β-arrestin2-mediated ERK activation."
https://openalex.org/W2143481850,"In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that 17β-estradiol (βE2) is a neuroprotectant in the retina, using two experimental approaches: 1) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced retinal neuron degeneration in vitro, and 2) light-induced photoreceptor degeneration in vivo. We demonstrated that both βE2 and 17α-estradiol (αE2) significantly protected against H2O2-induced retinal neuron degeneration; however, progesterone had no effect. βE2 transiently increased the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, when phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate and [32γATP] were used as substrate. Phospho-Akt levels were also transiently increased by βE2 treatment. Addition of the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen did not reverse the protective effect of βE2, whereas the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibited the protective effect of βE2, suggesting that βE2 mediates its effect through some PI3K-dependent pathway, independent of the estrogen receptor. Pull-down experiments with glutathione S-transferase fused to the N-Src homology 2 domain of p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, indicated that βE2 and αE2, but not progesterone, identified phosphorylated insulin receptor β-subunit (IRβ) as a binding partner. Pretreatment with insulin receptor inhibitor, HNMPA, inhibited IRβ activation of PI3K. Systemic administration of βE2 significantly protected the structure and function of rat retinas against light-induced photoreceptor cell degeneration and inhibited photoreceptor apoptosis. In addition, systemic administration of βE2 activated retinal IRβ, but not the insulin-like growth factor receptor-1, and produced a transient increase in PI3K activity and phosphorylation of Akt in rat retinas. The results show that estrogen has retinal neuroprotective properties in vivo and in vitro and suggest that the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in estrogen-mediated retinal neuroprotection. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that 17β-estradiol (βE2) is a neuroprotectant in the retina, using two experimental approaches: 1) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced retinal neuron degeneration in vitro, and 2) light-induced photoreceptor degeneration in vivo.

The results show that estrogen has retinal neuroprotective properties in vivo and in vitro and suggest that the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in estrogen-mediated retinal neuroprotection. Oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death has been implicated in different neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (1Moosmann B. Behl C. Expert Opin. Investig.

There is substantial evidence that light injures photoreceptors by increasing the formation of reactive oxygen species (3Yamashita H. Horie K. Yamamoto T. Nagano T. Hirano T.

During the past decade, several therapeutic approaches, including retinal transplantation (19Lund R.D. Kwan A.S. Keegan D.J. Sauve Y. Coffey P.J. Lawrence J.M. Prog. Retin.

However, no effective medical therapy is currently available in humans, although vitamin A supplementation has shown some beneficial effect by slowing down the progression of retinitis pigmentosa (23Berson E.L. Int. Ophthalmol. Clin. 2000; 40: 93-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The female sex hormone estrogen has a variety of metabolic activities including numerous effects on neurons (24Carrer H.F. Cambiasso M.J. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 22: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, the notion that estrogen is only important for sex differentiation and maturation has changed, to include its function as a neuromodulator and neuroprotectant. It appears that estrogen specifically maintains verbal memory in women and may prevent the deterioration in short and long term memory which is associated with normal aging (25Sherwin B.B. J. Psychiatry Neurosci. 1999; 24: 315-321PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, estrogen is not restricted to females because the male sex hormone testosterone (and other steroids with a 19-carbon atom structure, so-called C-19 steroids) can be converted chemically to estradiol in various tissues, including the brain, by an aromatase P450 enzyme (26Schumacher M.

Several lines of evidence suggest that estrogen has neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties (27Wise P.M. Trends Endocrinol.

Addition of βE2 to defined culture media increased the viability, survival, and differentiation of primary neuronal cultures from different brain areas including amygdala (29Lorenzo A. Diaz H. Carrer H. Caceres A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 418-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), hypothalamus (30Cambiasso M.J. Carrer H.F. J. Neurosci.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2531-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the role of estrogen in the protection of retinal neurons is not well understood. We have previously used both H2O2-induced cell death of cultured retinal neurons and light-induced photoreceptor degeneration as model systems to study the role of neurotrophic factors, pigment epithelium-derived factor, or basic fibroblast survival factor on retinal neuronal cell protection (11Cao W. Tombran-Tink J. Chen W. Mrazek D. Elias R. McGinnis J.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 22Cao W. Tombran-Tink J. Elias R. Sezate S. Mrazek D. McGinnis J.F. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1646-1652PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used in vitro and in vivo approaches to examine the role of estrogen as a neuroprotectant in the retina. Primary Culture of Retinal Neurons—Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were ordered each week and the retinas of 10-15 pups, 0-2 days old, were removed with the aid of a dissecting microscope under sterile conditions in a tissue culture hood. The retinas were suspended in 25 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with F-12 medium plus 10% fetal calf serum in a plastic bag and mechanically dissociated for 2 min using a Stomacher set on low power. The suspension was first filtered through a 230-μm sieve, which was then rinsed once with medium, and the combined filtrates were passed through a 140-μm sieve followed by a rinse with undiluted fetal calf serum. The filtered suspension was centrifuged at 800 rpm in a clinical centrifuge for 5 min, the supernatant decanted, and the cell pellets resuspended in 25 ml of media using a sterile 5-ml pipette. The concentration of cells was determined with a cell counter or hemocytometer and the suspension diluted with medium to 1 × 105 cells/ml. The cells (1 ml) were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates on 12-mm coverslips that had been pretreated overnight with 10 μg/ml poly-d-lysine. The cells were maintained in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with F-12 medium and 2% fetal calf serum or in synthetic serum-free media. The cultures were used in experiments 7-10 days after plating. Immunocytochemistry—Cells grown in culture on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.5) and then rinsed three times with 1.0 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and maintained at 4 °C in that buffer until processed for immunocytochemistry as described in a previous report (33Cao W. Chen W. Elias R. McGinnis J.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, nonspecific binding sites were blocked by 2% normal goat serum for 30 min. The cells were incubated overnight with anti-recoverin antibody (1:5,000) and anti-estrogen receptor-α antibody (1: 100) in TBS with 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% goat serum, and 0.01% Triton X-100. Recoverin was detected using goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Texas Red, whereas estrogen receptor-α was visualized using biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG followed by incubation with streptavidin conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. The control experiments were performed using normal IgGs at the same concentration as the primary antibodies as well as omitting primary antibodies as control for nonspecific labeling by secondary antibody. Cells treated without primary antibody were unlabeled. The cells on coverslips were then mounted with anti-fade mounting medium and viewed and photographed with an Eclipse 800 Nikon microscope equipped with fluorescence and Nomarski optics and a digital camera. The images were transferred and stored in a computer. MTT Assay—As described previously (33Cao W. Chen W. Elias R. McGinnis J.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), MTT (3,(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma) was dissolved at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in phosphate buffered saline. Lysing buffer was prepared as follows. 20% w/v of SDS (Sigma) was dissolved at 37 °C in a solution of 50% of each N,N-dimethylformamide (Sigma) and deionized water. 25 μl of the 5 mg/ml stock solution of MTT was added to each well, and after 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, 100 μl of the lysing buffer was added. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, absorbance of the samples was read at 562 nm using a microtiter plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. TUNEL Assay—Detection of apoptosis using the TUNEL (TdT-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP nick-end labeling) method was carried out with a commercially available in situ apoptosis detection kit as described previously (11Cao W. Tombran-Tink J. Chen W. Mrazek D. Elias R. McGinnis J.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Staining for the TUNEL assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. TUNEL-positive cells were identified with a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope, and images were captured by a digital camera and stored in a computer. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated by dividing TUNEL-positive cells by the total number of cells visualized by Nomarski optics in the same field. Three digitized images of similar total cell numbers were selected from each coverslip for counting and averaging and were considered as one independent experiment. Three independent experiments were then averaged. DNA Fragmentation—DNA laddering was carried out essentially as described previously (34Chen W. Cao W. Achyuthan A.M. McGinnis J.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 63: 116-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The cells were homogenized in 1 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml freshly prepared proteinase K) using a Tissue Tearor™ (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK). Each sample was placed on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. After centrifugation the supernatant from each sample was extracted with phenol/chloroform until the white precipitate was no longer visible in the aqueous fraction. This usually took three to six extractions. The genomic DNA was then precipitated overnight at -20 °C with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol. The samples were then centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer (Tris-Cl and EDTA, pH 8.0). RNase A was then added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Finally 3-5 μl of each sample was run on a 2% agarose gel at 40 volts for 2 h. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were resolved by 7.5, 10, or 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were washed twice for 5 min with TTBS (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Tween 20) and blocked with 10% non-fat dry milk in TTBS overnight at 4 °C. The blots were then incubated with anti-p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (1:1,000), anti-Akt (1:500), anti-pAkt S473 (1:2,500), anti-insulin receptor β-subunit (IRβ) (1:1,000) antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Following primary antibody incubations, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-goat IgG) and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PI3K Assay—Enzyme assays were carried out essentially as described previously (35Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Schaffhausen B. Pallas D.C. White M. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 36Guo X. Ghalayini A.J. Chen H. Anderson R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1873-1882PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, assays were performed directly on total cells in 50 μl of the reaction mixture containing 0.2 mg/ml phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate, 50 μm ATP, 0.2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. The reactions were performed for 15 min at room temperature and stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 n HCl followed by 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Lipids were extracted and resolved on oxalate-coated TLC plates (silica gel 60) with a solvent system of 2-propanol and 2 m acetic acid (65:35, v/v). The TLC plates were prepared by placing in 1% (w/v) potassium oxalate in 50% methanol (v/v) and baked in an oven at 100 °C for 1 h before use. TLC plates were exposed to x-ray film overnight at -70 °C, and radioactive lipids were scraped and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. GST-p85 Fusion Proteins and Pull-down Experiments—Glutathione S-transferase (GST-p85-N-SH2) (314-446 amino acids) fusion proteins were generated by PCR amplification of the p85α cDNA and cloned into a GST vector (37Rajala R.V. McClellan M.E. Ash J.D. Anderson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43319-43326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The sequence of each clone was verified by DNA sequencing. All inductions yielded proteins of the expected size, as judged by Coomassie Blue staining. Pull-down experiments were performed as described previously (38Rajala R.V. Anderson R.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3110-3117PubMed Google Scholar), using 5 μg of GST fusion proteins that had been absorbed onto GST-Sepharose 4B matrix. Cultured retinal neurons were incubated with GST/GST-p85 fusion proteins with continuous mixing at 4 °C for 1.5 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times in 500 μl of HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol)and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C. Proteins bound to GST-p85 were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes followed by Western blot analysis with anti-IRβ antibody. Light-induced Photoreceptor Degeneration—Female Sprague-Dawley albino rats were raised and maintained in a cyclic light environment (12 h on, 12 h off at an in-cage illumination of less than 10 lux). Ovariectomy was performed 2 weeks before exposure to constant light for 24 h at age 3-4 months. Constant light at an illumination level of 1,700 lux was provided by two 40-W white fluorescent light bulbs that were suspended 50 cm above the floor of the cage. During light exposure, rats were maintained in transparent polycarbonate cages with stainless-steel wire bar covers. A water bottle was kept in the appropriate depression in the cage cover, but food was placed in the bottom of the cage on the bedding. Animals received intraperitoneal injection of βE2 (500 μg/kg of body weight) or vehicle 1 h before exposure to constant light for 24 h. Functional Rescue of Photoreceptor Cells Evaluated by Electroretinogram—Electroretinogram (ERG) recordings were performed as described previously (22Cao W. Tombran-Tink J. Elias R. Sezate S. Mrazek D. McGinnis J.F. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1646-1652PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were kept in total darkness overnight before the ERG recording. Pupils were dilated with 1% atropine and 2.5% phenylephrine HCl. Animals were anesthetized intramuscularly with a ketamine/xylazine mixture. ERG responses were recorded with a silver chloride needle electrode placed in the cornea with 1% tetracaine topical anesthesia. A reference electrode was positioned at the nasal fornix and a ground electrode on the foot. The duration of light stimulation was 10 μs, and the band pass was set at 0.3-500 Hz. 14 responses were measured with flash intervals of 20 s. For quantitative analysis, the B-wave amplitude was measured at saturating light intensity. Morphological Protection of Photoreceptors Evaluated by Quantitative Histology—After electroretinographic testing, animals were killed by an overdose of carbon dioxide. Eyes were enucleated, fixed, and embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm-thick sections were taken along the vertical meridian to allow comparison of all regions of the eye. Outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness was measured at nine defined points along the vertical meridian in the superior and inferior hemispheres, using the optic nerve head as a point of reference. The distance between each point was 450 μm. In addition to the mean ONL thickness for the entire retinal section, ONL thickness of the region of retina most sensitive to the damaging effects of light was compared among different groups of rats. In each of the experiments where ONL thickness was quantified, a single section from the retinas of at least 6 (usually 10 or more) eyes was measured. Serum Levels of βE2—Serum (50 μl) was removed by tail vein 1 h after intraperitoneal injection of βE2, and βE2 was measured in triplicate by a competitive enzyme immunoassay kit (Estradiol EIA kit, Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by means of analysis of variance and assessed further by Dunnett tests. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. βE2 Attenuates H2O2-induced Cytotoxicity—We tested the cytoprotective effects of βE2 in our well characterized retinal neuronal culture system, using H2O2 to generate an oxidant stress. We first examined the cytotoxicity of βE2 on neurons by treating the cultures with different concentrations of βE2 ranging from 0.0001 to 100 μm. A significant reduction in cell viability was observed only at the relatively high 100 μm concentration (Fig. 1B). To evaluate the role of βE2 in protecting retinal neurons from H2O2-induced cytotoxicity, we pretreated retinal neuron cultures with different concentrations of βE2 (ranging from 0.001 to 10 μm) 30 min prior to H2O2 (100 μm) treatment; significant increases in cell viability were observed between 0.1 and 10 μm of βE2 (Fig. 1C). We used absolute ethanol to dissolve βE2. When culture medium contained 10 μm βE2, the concentration of ethanol was 0.01%. There was no significant cytotoxicity of 0.01% ethanol treatment for up to 24 h as measured by the MTT assay (Fig. 1A). Effect of the Estrogen Receptor Inhibitor Tamoxifen—To investigate whether the cytoprotective effects of βE2 are mediated through the estrogen receptor, we repeated the experiments described above in the presence of tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor blocker. Fig. 2A shows that additions of tamoxifen at 5 μm for 24 h did not significantly affect cell viability, although decreases in cell viability were observed at 10 and 100 μm concentrations. Pretreatment with 5 μm tamoxifen for 30 min prior to the addition of βE2 did not significantly block the neuroprotective effect of βE2 in this study (Fig. 2B). Immunocytochemical analysis of cultured primary retinal neurons showed that a very small population of cells (less than 1%) was estrogen receptor-positive. These cells were recoverin-negative, indicating that they were not photoreceptor cells, and were usually double or triple the size of recoverin-positive cells (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Visualization of recoverin-positive and estrogen receptor-α-positive cells in culture. A, Nomarski image; B, fluorescein green-stained estrogen receptor-α-positive cells; C, Texas Red-stained recoverin-positive cells; D, superimposition of fluorescein isothiocyanate (green) image and Texas Red image on the Nomarski image. The white arrows indicate estrogen receptor-positive cells that are recoverin-negative.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) βE2 Inhibits Apoptosis Induced by H2O2—The TUNEL assay was performed to determine whether βE2 can inhibit apoptotic cell death induced by H2O2. A few positive staining cells were noted in control cultures, whereas cultures treated with 100 μm H2O2 for 24 h had large numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis. However, pretreatment of retinal neurons with 10 μm βE2 for 30 min prior to H2O2 (100 μm) exposure led to a dramatic decrease in the numbers of apoptotic cells. A few TUNEL-positive cells were noted in the group pretreated with βE2 without exposure to H2O2. The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 4A) in control cultures or βE2-treated cultures without H2O2 exposure from three independent experiments was 3-6%, whereas H2O2-treated cultures exhibited 53% positive cells. Pretreatment with βE2 significantly reduced the positive cells to 16%. This inhibition of apoptosis by βE2 was also evidenced in DNA fragmentation study showing a complete prevention of DNA fragmentation induced by H2O2 (Fig. 4B, lane 9). Effects of 17α-Estradiol (αE2) and Progesterone—The specificity of the βE2 effect was determined by testing two other steroids, αE2, an isomer of βE2 that does not activate the estrogen receptor, and progesterone. Neither was cytotoxic to the cells at the concentration of 10 μm when added in the absence of H2O2. A few positive staining cells were noted in control cultures (Fig. 5A), whereas large numbers of cells undergoing apoptotic cell death (Fig. 5B) were present in cultures treated with 100 μm H2O2 for 24 h. Pretreatment of retinal neurons with 10 μm αE2 for 30 min prior to H2O2 (100 μm) exposure caused a significant decrease in the numbers of apoptotic cells (Fig. 5D). However, pretreatment with 10 μm progesterone for 30 min prior to H2O2 (100 μm) exposure did not appear to inhibit apoptosis induced by H2O2 significantly (Fig. 5F). Quantification of the number of apoptotic cells showed that cultures treated with either αE2 or progesterone had no more apoptotic cells than untreated cultures (4-7%). However, pretreatment with αE2 decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells in H2O2-treated cultures from 49 to 22%, whereas progesterone-pretreated cultures remained 42% TUNEL-positive (Fig. 5G). Thus, αE2 significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells, although to a lesser extent than βE2 (Fig. 4A). Another indication of the effectiveness of αE2 was that it significantly reduced DNA fragmentation, whereas progesterone did not (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 7). Morphological and Functional Evaluations of Photoreceptor Cell Rescue in Vivo—Neuroprotection by systemic administration of βE2 was evaluated by quantitative histology, ERG, and TUNEL assay. 24 h of exposure to fluorescent light (1,700 lux) reduced the thickness of the ONL of photoreceptor cell nuclei from the normal 10-13 rows in control animals (Fig. 6, A and B) to 3 rows in the most degenerated region of the retina"
https://openalex.org/W2134205085,"A new C-type lectin-like gene encodes 293 amino acids and maps to chromosome 19p13.3 adjacent to the previously described C-type lectin genes, CD23, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), and DC-SIGN-related protein (DC-SIGNR). The four genes form a tight cluster in an insert size of 105 kb and have analogous genomic structures. The new C-type lectin-like molecule, designated liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin), is a type II integral membrane protein of ∼40 kDa in size with a single C-type lectin-like domain at the COOH terminus, closest in homology to DC-SIGNR, DC-SIGN, and CD23. LSECtin mRNA was only expressed in liver and lymph node among 15 human tissues tested, intriguingly neither expressed on hematopoietic cell lines nor on monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Moreover, LSECtin is expressed predominantly by sinusoidal endothelial cells of human liver and lymph node and co-expressed with DC-SIGNR. LSECtin binds to mannose, GlcNAc, and fucose in a Ca2+-dependent manner but not to galactose. Our results indicate that LSECtin is a novel member of a family of proteins comprising CD23, DC-SIGN, and DC-SIGNR and might function in vivo as a lectin receptor.

Protein-carbohydrate interactions serve multiple functions in the immune system. A number of animal lectins (sugar-binding proteins) mediate both pathogen recognition and cell-cell interactions using structurally related Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domains (C-type CRDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CTLD, C-type lectin-like domain; DC, dendritic cell(s); DC-SIGN, DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin; DC-SIGNR, DC-SIGN-related protein; EST, expressed sequence tag; FCS, fetal cattle serum; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; ORF, open reading frame; PBMC, peripheral blood monocyte cell; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; aa, amino acids; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; contig, group of overlapping clones; LSECtin, liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin; sLSECtin, soluble LSECtin. (1Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Google Scholar). There are two groups of membrane-bound C-type lectins, type I and type II C-type lectins, which are distinguished from each other by the orientation of their cell surface NH2 terminus pointing outwards or into the cytoplasm of the cell, respectively. The type II C-type lectins identified so far have a single CRD at the extracellular carboxyl terminus (2Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Adema G.J. Nat. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 2: 77-84Google Scholar). The genes coding for the type II C-type lectins are mainly localized in chromosome 12p12.3-p13.2 (3Trowsdale J. Barten R. Haude A. Stewart C.A. Beck S. Wilson M.J. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 181: 20-38Google Scholar) and 19p13.3 (4Soilleux E.J. Barten R. Trowsdale J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2937-2942Google Scholar). The former is the natural killer gene complex, and the latter is the cluster of genes including CD23, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), and DC-SIGN-related protein (DC-SIGNR). In the last cluster, these three genes have analogous genomic structures and form a tight cluster in an insert size of 105 kb on human chromosome 19p13.3 (4Soilleux E.J. Barten R. Trowsdale J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2937-2942Google Scholar). They display similar domain composition and organization containing a short NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular region that consists of a coiled-coil neck domain and a C-terminal CRD. The close linkage and similar genomic and protein structures suggest that these three genes may have arisen via duplication of an ancestral gene (5Soilleux E.J. Clin. Sci. 2003; 104: 437-446Google Scholar). Indeed, they share some common functions in vivo in that they serve as cell-cell adhesion molecules and play an important role in the immune system (6Bonnefoy J.Y. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Gauchat J.F.

Med. 2001; 193: 671-678Google Scholar). CD23, a low affinity receptor for IgE, was first identified as a type II C-type lectin in the latter gene cluster, which was expressed on a wide variety of human hematopoietic cell types including B and T cells, follicular dendritic cells, monocytes, platelets, Langerhans cells, esoinophils, and natural killer cells (9Conrad D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 623-645Google Scholar). CD23 specifically recognizes at least four different ligands, including IgE (10Yukawa K. Kikutani H. Howaki H. Yamasaki K. Yokota A. Nakamura H. Barsumian E.L. Hardy R.R. Suemura M. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1987; 38: 2576-2580Google Scholar), CD21 (11Aubry J.P. Pochon S. Gauchat J.F. Nueda-Marin A. Holers V.M. Graber P. Siegfried C.

The CD23-CD21 and CD23-β2-integrin interactions are lectin-like in that CD23 recognizes specific carbohydrate structures expressed on CD21 and CD11b/c, respectively (11Aubry J.P. Pochon S.

In contrast, CD23 binds deglycosylated IgE, suggesting the non-lectin-like recognition of a protein (rather than a carbohydrate) epitope (13Delespesse G. Sarfati M. Wu C.Y. Fournier S. Letellier M. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 125: 77-97Google Scholar). CD23 plays an important role in a variety of biological activities such as cell-cell adhesions, survival of B cells in germinal centers, regulation of IgE synthesis, and antigen presentation (6Bonnefoy J.Y. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Gauchat J.F. Graber P. Aubry J.P. Jeannin P. Plater-Zyberk C. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 16: 113-128Google Scholar). DC-SIGN, originally described in 1992 as a C-type lectin being able to bind the human immunodeficiency virus surface protein, gp120 (14Curtis B.M. Scharnowske S. Watson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8356-8360Google Scholar), is expressed on dendritic cells and some subsets of macrophages (15Geijtenbeek T.B. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Adema G.J. van Kooyk Y.

DC-SIGNR, which shows 77% identity to DC-SIGN at the nuclear acid level, is highly expressed on human liver and lymph node sinusoidal and placental endothelial cells (8Bashirova A.A.

Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Google Scholar). DC-SIGN regulates the migration of dendritic cells and their interaction with lymphocytes through interactions with ICAM-2 on endothelium and ICAM-3 on T cells, respectively (15Geijtenbeek T.B.

To date, there have been many studies suggesting that DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR can also facilitate infections of viral and bacterial pathogens including human immunodeficiency virus (20Geijtenbeek T.B.

Recently, many new genes with important biological functions have been detected based on large scale sequencing of human fetal liver cDNA library in our laboratory (26Qu X.H. Zhang C.G. Zhai Y.

Genomics. 2000; 63: 400-408Google Scholar). To identify potential novel adhesion molecules, more than 14,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of human fetal liver cDNA libraries (29Yu Y. Zhang C. Zhou G. Wu S. Qu X. Wei H. Xing G. Dong C. Zhai Y. Wan J. Ouyang S. Li L. Zhang S. Zhou K. Zhang Y. Wu C. He F. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1392-1403Google Scholar) have been analyzed to search homologues of CD23, DC-SIGN, and DC-SIGNR, which were selected as baits, because all of them are important adhesion molecules involved in host defense. Among these ESTs, an insert clone D1210 with moderate homology to human DC-SIGNR, DC-SIGN, and CD23 at the amino acid level was selected for further study. This novel C-type lectin-like gene, termed LSECtin, is localized between CD23 and DC-SIGN, which is followed by DC-SIGNR, on chromosome 19p13.3, and these four structurally related genes form a tight cluster. In this study, we report on the molecular cloning, mapping, expression of LSECtin, and characterization of its sugar-binding activities. Cell Lines—The promyelomonocytic cell line HL60; the chronic myelogenous leukemia K562; the monocyte cell lines U937 and THP-1; the B cell lines Raji, Daudi, and Namalwa; the T cell lines Jurkat, Hut-78, and Molt-4; the natural killer cell line, NKL; and liver cancer cell lines HepG2 and BEL-7402 were all obtained from the Cell Bank (Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences). The CHO cell line was obtained from the ATCC. Hematopoietic cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Hyclone), and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. HepG2, BEL-7402, and CHO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mm glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated FCS, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were prepared as previously reported (30Whelan J. Ghersa P. Hooft van Huijsduijnen R. Gray J. Chandra G. Talabot F. DeLamarter J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2645-2653Google Scholar). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy adult volunteers by Ficoll centrifugation (Amersham Biosciences). An aliquot of these PBMCs were stimulated for 72 h with phytohemagglutinin (5 μg/ml; Sigma). Peripheral blood granulocytes were purified from erythrocytes by hypotonic lysis (155 mm NH4Cl). DC cultures were obtained from peripheral blood monocytes as described elsewhere (31Romani N. Gruner S. Braug D. Lenz A. Trockenbacher B. Konwalinka G. Fritsch P.O. Steinman R.M. Schuler G. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 83-93Google Scholar). In brief, PBMCs in RPMI 1640, 10% FCS were allowed to adhere to 6-well plates (Costar). After 1 h at 37 °C, the nonadherent cells were washed off by extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, and the adherent monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% FCS with 1000 units/ml GM-CSF and 1000 units/ml IL-4 (R & D Systems). On day 4, the cultures were refreshed by adding culture medium supplemented with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 (both at 500 units/ml). At day 7, nonadherent and loosely proliferating DC aggregates were collected and tested by flow cytometry for CD1α, CD86, CD83, and HLA-DR (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mAbs; Becton Dickinson) expression. Identification and Cloning of Human LSECtin—To identify novel adhesion molecules homologous to CD23, DC-SIGN, and DC-SIGNR, a cDNA library of human fetal liver of 22 weeks in our laboratory (29Yu Y. Zhang C. Zhou G. Wu S. Qu X. Wei H. Xing G. Dong C. Zhai Y. Wan J. Ouyang S. Li L. Zhang S. Zhou K. Zhang Y. Wu C. He F. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1392-1403Google Scholar) was searched using the tBlastn algorithm with their CRD sequences. A novel human cDNA clone (D1210) homologous to human DC-SIGNR, DC-SIGN, and CD23 was isolated and characterized. An online BLAST search was performed against the public EST and nonredundant GenBank™ data base using the D1210 sequence, and then the human clones homologous to D1210 were picked for further analysis. Based on the results of ESTs, we designed an antisense primer (GSP1, 5′-GGA ACA GCT CAG TGC GGA CGT CCT CAC-3′) and a sense primer (GSP2, 5′-CCT GCG GGA ACT GCG TGA GCG CGT GAC-3′) to perform 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE, respectively. 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE were carried out using a SMARTTM RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) on adapter-ligated cDNA, synthesized from 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from fetal liver (Clontech). 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE reactions were performed by touchdown PCR program as described by the manufacturer. In both cases, a nested PCR was performed with an inner primer, NGSP1 (5′-GCT CTC CTG CTC CAT CAG CTT CGC-3′), for 5′-RACE and NGSP2 (5′-GTG AGG ACG TCC GCA CTG AGC TGT TCC-3′) for 3′-RACE, respectively. PCRs were carried out at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The predominant fragments were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) for sequencing. DNA sequencing was carried out on an ABI Prism 377-XL DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Chromosomal Localization and Sequence Analysis of Human LSEC-tin—The full-length cDNA sequence of LSECtin was used to search the human genome and picked up its corresponding genomic sequence. The alignment analysis between the cDNA and its genomic sequence was performed to determine the boundaries of exons and introns and the intronic lengths of the LSECtin gene. The genomic sequences of DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, and CD23 were also obtained using their cDNA for comparison. The sequence alignment among the type II C-type lectins homologous to LSECtin was performed using the program ClustalW. Protein subsequence motif was identified using the network service SMART (available on the World Wide Web at smart.embl-heidelberg.de). Prosite information of the protein was analyzed with the TMpred program that was used to make a prediction of membrane-spanning regions and their orientation. Northern Blot and RT-PCR Analysis—Two human multiple tissue Northern Blots containing ∼2 μg of poly(RNA)+ per lane (MTN; Clontech) were hybridized to the specific probes of LSECtin and β-actin, respectively, following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, members were hybridized in ExpressHyb™ hybridization solution (Clontech) containing 1 × 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled cDNA for LSECtin or β-actin. The probe for LSECtin corresponded to the open reading frame (ORF) of LSECtin and was generated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dNTP using the Primer-a-Gene® Labeling system (Promega). After being washed, the blots were exposed to x-ray film at -70 °C with an intensifying screen. Total RNAs were extracted from human peripheral blood cells, cultured cell lines, placenta, and fetal liver using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). First cDNA was synthesized using random hexameric primers (Promega) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), as recommended by the manufacturer. Primers flanking the ORF of LSECtin were used for PCRs (forward, 5′-GCC ATG GAC ACC ACC AGG TAC AGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GAC TCA GCA GTT GTG CCT TTT CTC-3′). The PCRs were performed under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min and then 35 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 58 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Specific primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as an internal control for cDNA quantity (5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′ as sense primer, 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′ as antisense primer). The products were visualized on ethidium bromide gels. Preparation of Anti-LSECtin Polyclonal Antibody—cDNA coding the extracellular LSECtin (aa 55–293) was generated by PCR with the primers (forward, 5′-GGA TTC AAG GCC TCC ACG GAG CGC G-3′; reverse, 5′-GTC GAC TCA GCA GTT GTG CCT TTT CTC-3′), cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced. The fragment encoding the neck and CTLD domain of LSECtin was ligated immediately downstream of the hexahistidine sequence in pET-28a vector (Novagen). This recombinant vector was introduced into BL21 (DE3) cells. His-LSECtin protein was extracted from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-treated BL21 cells in 8 m urea, 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer and then purified under denatured conditions using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Purified His-LSECtin fusion protein was subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE separation, and then the His-LSECtin protein was excised from the gel, pulverized, and emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 852-861Google Scholar). The LSECtin antigen was injected subcutaneously into adult New Zealand White rabbits. After four rounds of booster injections with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma), serum was collected, and then contaminant rabbit Abs were immunoabsorbed from the antiserum. For these purposes, antisera were first absorbed with dried BL21 cells powder, which was prepared by precipitation of BL21 cells with cold acetone for 15 min on ice (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 852-861Google Scholar), and then with CHO cells, which had been fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100. The IgG fraction of this absorbed antiserum was purified by an rProtein A FF column (Amersham Biosciences). The IgG fraction of preimmune serum was also purified and served as rabbit control IgG. Immunoblotting and Immunofluorescence Analysis—The whole coding region of LSECtin was initially obtained by RT-PCR on the fetal liver total RNA as described above. PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced. The entire coding sequence of LSECtin was subcloned in-frame into pcDNA3.1A vector (Invitrogen) to produce the construct allowing the expression of C-terminal tagged Myc-His fusion protein. CHO cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected for 10–14 days in presence of 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Resistant populations were enriched for cells expressing LSECtin and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS supplemented with 300 μg/ml G418. CHO cells stably expressing LSECtin (CHO-LSECtin) and CHO cells transfected with an empty vector (mock cells) were treated in a lysis buffer containing 20 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.15% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions or by 10% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.), which were blotted either with rabbit anti-LSECtin serum (1.5 μg/ml) or anti-Myc mAb (0.5 μg/ml). After an extensive wash, membranes were further blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For detecting LSECtin protein in fetal liver, the membrane proteins were extracted from fetal liver tissue using an aqueous two-phase partitioning system according to previously reported methods (33Morre D.J. Morre D.M. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 946-958Google Scholar). The membrane and cytosolic fractions and crude lysates of fetal liver tissues were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE under reduced conditions and then immunoblotted as described above. For immunofluorescence, CHO-LSECtin cultured on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 h at 37 °C, and stained with rabbit anti-LSECtin (5 μg/ml), anti-Myc mAb (2.5 μg/ml), or preimmune rabbit IgG (5 μg/ml) according to the standard procedure (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 72-79Google Scholar). All cell samples were viewed on an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus). For flow cytometric analysis, CHO-LSECtin and mock cells were freed from culture plates using 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline. For staining, 2 × 105 cells were incubated in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% BSA, 0.02% sodium azide (FACS buffer), and rabbit anti-LSECtin (5 μg/ml) or anti-Myc mAb (2.5 μg/ml). After 30 min at 4 °C, the cells were washed with the FACS buffer and recovered in 100 μl of FACS buffer containing 2 μg of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody against rabbit or mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) per ml. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with FACS buffer, and analyzed by a FACSCalibur apparatus (Becton Dickinson). Immunohistochemistry—5-μm paraffin sections of normal human liver and lymph node tissues were obtained from Dr. Zhao at the Center of Cancer Medicine, Beijing. Rehydrated paraffin sections were pressure-cooked for 3 min in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. After washing, the sections were preblocked in 0.5% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min and then blocked in 10% normal goat serum for 2 h. Then the sections were incubated with rabbit anti-LSECtin serum (5 μg/ml), rabbit anti-von Willerbrand factor (1:50 dilution), and preimmunization rabbit IgG (5 μg/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C, respectively. Subsequently, sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min and finally with streptavidin coupled to peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min. After washing, enzyme activity was developed using 3,3-diaminobenzidine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Double immunofluorescence staining was performed on formalin-fixed liver and lymph node tissues using rabbit anti-LSECtin serum and goat anti-DC-SIGNR. Antigen unmasking was done as described above. After blocking in 1% bovine serum albumin, 10% house serum, 10% chicken serum, both primary antibodies (5 μg/ml) were added overnight at 4 °C. Sections were washed with TBS and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C either with red-conjugated chicken anti-goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or biotinylated horse anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin. The stained slides were analyzed by using a conventional fluorescence microscope (Olympus). Preparation of LSECtin-Fc Fusion Protein—Recombinant chimeras containing the entire extracellular region of LSECtin fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 (LSECtin-Fc) were generated by PCR using fetal liver cDNA. The forward and reverse primers were used (5′-GC AAG CTT AAG GCC TCC ACG GAG CGC-3′ and 5′-GGC TCT AGA GCA GTT GTG CCT TTT CTC-3′). The PCR product was cloned in-frame downstream of the signal sequence of CD33 in Signal pIgplus vector (35Freeman S.D. Kelm S. Barber E.K. Crocker P.R. Blood. 1995; 85: 2005-2012Google Scholar). Plasmids were transfected into CHO cells by LipofectAMINE™ 2000. The cells stably expressing LSECtin-Fc were selected by G418 as described above. After 5 days of incubation in a non-protein-containing CD CHO medium (Invitrogen) with 300 μg/ml G418, the culture supernatant was harvested, followed by affinity chromatography with rProtein A FF column, and then examined by immunoblotting with anti-Fc mAb (Sigma). Sugar Binding Assays—Sugar binding assays were performed as previously reported (36East L. Rushton S. Taylor M.E. Isacke C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50469-50475Google Scholar). For LSECtin-Fc chimeras, 200 μl of CHO tissue culture supernatant in 800 μl of loading buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 25 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2) was loaded onto 1-ml columns of mannose-, GlcNAc-, fucose-, or galactose-agarose (Sigma). The flow-through was collected, and the columns were washed with 8 × 1 ml of loading buffer followed by 8 × 1 ml of elution buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm EDTA). For CHOLSECtin cells, cells were lysed in detergent extraction solution (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm CaCl2). Lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min before centrifugation at 4 °C and 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected. 400 μl of supernatant was added to 600 μl of loading buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.15% Triton X-100) and applied to the columns. The columns were washed in loading buffer and eluted in elution buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15% Triton X-100, and 10 mm EDTA). Fractions were precipitated by incubation with 20 μg of BSA and 0.5 ml of 30% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C, 15,000 × g. The pellets were washed twice in 1:1 ethanol ether, air-dried, and resuspended in 40 μl of reducing sample buffer. Samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-LSECtin antibody. Sugar Competition Assays—First, Man30-BSA (E.-Y. Laboratories) was labeled with biotin using EZ-Link TFP-PEO-Biotin (Pierce) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Purified sLSEC-tin-Fc fusion proteins were immobilized on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (NUNC, Denmark) by overnight incubation of 200 μg/ml stock solution at 4 °C (50 μl/well). After blocking of the wells usi"
https://openalex.org/W1991423906,"Short lived cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs are destabilized by an A+U-rich element (ARE) in the 3′-untranslated region. Several regulatory proteins bind to AREs in cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs, participate in inhibiting or promoting their rapid degradation of ARE mRNAs, and influence cytokine expression and cellular transformation in experimental models. The tissue distribution and cellular localization of the different AU-rich binding proteins (AUBPs), however, have not been uniformly characterized in the mouse, a model for ARE mRNA decay. We therefore carried out immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses of the different AUBPs using the same mouse tissues. We show that HuR protein, a major AUBP that stabilizes the ARE mRNAs, is most strongly expressed in the thymus, spleen (predominantly in lymphocytic cells), intestine, and testes. AUF1 protein, a negative regulator of ARE mRNA stability, displayed strong expression in thymus and spleen cells within lymphocytic cells, moderate expression in the epithelial linings of lungs, gonadal tissues, and nuclei of most neurons in the brain, and little expression in the other tissues. Tristetraprolin, a negative regulator of ARE mRNA stability, displayed a largely non-overlapping tissue distribution with AUF1 and was predominantly expressed in the liver and testis. KH-type splicing regulatory protein, a presumptive negative regulator of ARE mRNA stability, was distributed widely in murine organs. These results indicate that HuR and AUF1, which functionally oppose each other, have generally similar distributions, suggesting that the balance between HuR and AUF1 is likely important in control of short lived mRNA degradation, lymphocyte development, and/or cytokine production, and possibly in certain aspects of neurological function.

Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The mechanism and process by which the ARE promotes rapid degradation of mRNAs are not well understood. AREs generally consist of repeating pentamers of the sequence AUUUA, which promotes the rapid cytoplasmic degradation of cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNAs (1Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G.

Although a number of proteins can be cross-linked in vitro to the ARE, only several have been shown to have regulatory functions for ARE mRNAs. Two AUBPs (AUF1 and TTP) promote rapid decay of ARE mRNAs, one (HuR) inhibits mRNA turnover, and one (KH-type splicing-regulatory protein (KSRP)) is suspected in promoting ARE mRNA degradation. The protein TTP promotes rapid decay of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNAs (10Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S.

The protein family known as AUF1 or hnRNP D also binds the ARE and is associated with rapid decay of ARE mRNAs, as originally shown in an in vitro ARE mRNA decay system (14Brewer G. Mol. Cell.

Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Genomics. 1998; 48: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The four isoforms consist of a 37-kDa core protein (p37), a 40-kDa protein (p40) with an N-terminal 19-amino acid insertion of exon 2, a 42-kDa protein (p42) with a C-terminal 49-amino acid insertion of exon 7, and a 45-kDa protein (p45) containing both exon 2 and 7 insertions (reviewed in Ref. 1Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The different protein isoforms possess different ARE-RNA binding characteristics (16Kajita Y. Nakayama J.-I. Aizawa M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22167-22175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), ubiquitination, and stabilities (17Laroia G. Schneider R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The p37 followed by the p40 isoform is most closely associated with promotion of ARE mRNA degradation in a number of studies (18Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W.A.

HuR and HuB inhibit ARE mRNA turnover when ectopically overexpressed (25Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 26Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N.

Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) have identified HuR as an important stabilizer of short lived AU-rich mRNAs in a variety of settings and in different cell types in culture. The protein KSRP has been implicated in ARE mRNA decay, but it has not been shown to directly promote rapid mRNA turnover (33Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J. Stoecklin G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). KSRP has been found to copurify with the mammalian exosome, a large multiprotein complex containing 3′-5′-exoribonucleases and other proteins involved in mRNA degradation (33Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J. Stoecklin G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). In summary, two or three AUBPs promote ARE mRNA destabilization (TTP, AUF1, and possibly KSRP), yet only one family (Hu proteins) is known to promote ARE mRNA stabilization. In mammalian cell lines, HuR is widely expressed (34Good P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) but at different levels (22Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). It is possible that destabilization of ARE mRNAs involves multiple redundant protein functions, or it is restricted to different tissues by different proteins. Additionally, the fact that HuR, a major expressed member of the Hu protein family, stabilizes ARE mRNAs suggests that it is expressed in most tissues to provide for regulation in opposition to that of the destabilizing AUBPs, that in some tissues destabilizing AUBPs are likely unopposed in function, or that other inhibitors of ARE mRNA turnover remain to be identified. As might be expected for proteins that regulate proto-oncogene and cytokine mRNA stability, both HuR and AUF1 expression levels have been implicated in carcinogenesis. Overexpression of HuR has been associated with malignant brain and lung tumorigenesis (35Nabors L.B. Gillespie G.Y. Harkins L. King P.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2154-2161PubMed Google Scholar, 36Blaxall B.C. Dwyer-Nield L.D. Bauer A.K. Bohlmeyer T.J. Malkinson A.M. Port J.D. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and cellular proliferation (37Wang W. Yang X. Cristofalo V.J. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5889-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). AUF1 levels have also been associated with tumorigenesis in a mouse model (38Gouble A. Grazide S. Meggetto F. Mercier P. Delsol G. Morello D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1489-1495PubMed Google Scholar). There has been only a limited analysis of the adult mouse tissue distribution of the different regulators of ARE mRNA stability, and no study has examined the distribution of all AUBPs simultaneously in mice, in which much of the research on cytokine and proto-oncogene mRNA stability takes place. Here we report the tissue distribution of the major known regulators of ARE mRNA stability. These results suggest that HuR and AUF1 are found at the highest levels primarily in the same tissues (thymus and spleen, followed by intestine), whereas TTP is distributed in a largely non-overlapping manner with HuR. KSRP, which may play a role in ARE mRNA destabilization, was distributed widely. Antibodies—Anti-hnRNP D (5B9) monoclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. G. Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to recombinant p37 AUF1 were developed in our laboratory to bacterially produced and purified p37 protein, affinity purified and concentrated (PcAb 995). Antibodies to HuR (3A2 monoclonal antibody, Santa Cruz), TTP (H-120 polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz), and β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) were purchased commercially. A polyclonal antibody against KSRP (C2742) was a gift from Dr. D. Black (Howard Hughes Medical Institute/University of California, Los Angeles, CA). Cell Culture and Northern Blot Analysis—Chinese hamster ovary and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum or bovine calf serum, respectively. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were cultured on gelatin-coated plates and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, β-mercaptoethanol (100 μm), non-essential amino acids (100 μm), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor. Total RNA was isolated from ES cells by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 20 μg of total RNA was resolved in agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membrane. The blot was hybridized to 32P-labeled probes prepared against the 220-bp murine AUF1 exon 1 and exposed to film. Animal Studies—Experiments were carried out in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal treatment, housing, and euthanasia. Young adult C57BL/6 male and female mice (6 weeks old) were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. The organs were removed rapidly by dissection, cut into thin slices, homogenized, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for later use or fixed in neutral-buffered formaldehyde. Homogenization was carried out using 5 volumes of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)). After incubation on ice for 15 min, samples were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Then the soluble supernatant was reserved. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Protein Analysis—For Western immunoblot analysis, equal amounts of protein extracts from murine tissues or cells were denatured by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) and heating to 100 °C for 5 min. Equal amounts of cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotting was performed using primary antibody as indicated above. Immunoblots were developed using the ECL system. Immunohistochemistry Analysis—For immunohistochemistry, surgically excised organs were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, dehydrated through a series of ethanol followed by xylene clearing, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut to a 5-μm thickness and heated overnight in at 56 °C. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a series of alcohol. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) The sections were subjected to microwave antigen retrieval using a sodium citrate buffer. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by a 10-min incubation in 3% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline followed by rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific binding of the secondary antibody was blocked by incubating in 15% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C in anti-AUF1 polyclonal antibody (PcAb 995), which was diluted at 1:200 with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% normal goat serum. Following incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody and ABC reagent, staining was visualized using a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). The sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin, cleared, and mounted with Permount medium (Sigma). Validation of AUF1 Antibodies—Previous studies have not collectively compared the major AUBP regulators of ARE mRNA stability in mice in a variety of tissues and organs. In addition, our immunoblot studies indicate that the antibody (5B9) often used to detect hnRNP D/AUF1 strongly cross-reacts with another protein of similar molecular mass to the p45 AUF1 isoform (Fig. 1B), confounding previous immunohistochemical and immunoblot studies. We therefore first developed and affinity purified a highly specific polyclonal rabbit antibody (PcAb 995) to AUF1 that does not cross-react with other polypeptides within the range of 35-50 kDa. To demonstrate the specificity of this antibody, protein extracts from wild type and AUF1 knock-out ES cells were used. The details of the development of the AUF1 gene knock-out cells will be reported elsewhere. Northern mRNA analysis confirmed that the homozygous AUF1 knock-out ES cells (-/-) do not express AUF1 mRNA (Fig. 1A) compared with wild type (+/+) and heterozygous (+/-) ES cells. Using the same ES cells, anti-hnRNP D/AUF1 monoclonal antibody (5B9), which has been widely used in the literature, was found to cross-react with a slightly larger polypeptide. In 12% SDS-PAGE, an unidentified polypeptide was recognized by the 5B9 but not the PcAb 995 antibodies; this polypeptide migrates very closely with, but is clearly distinct from, the largest isoform of AUF1, as it remained present even in homozygous AUF1 knock-out ES cells (Fig. 1B, compare left with middle panel). This cross-reactivity could lead to misinterpretation of the unknown protein as the p45 AUF1 isoform and, accordingly, the actual p45 AUF1 protein as the p42 AUF1 isoform. The high affinity polyclonal anti-AUF1 antibody recognized four bands in wild type ES cells and in Chinese hamster ovary cells (the p40 and p42 AUF1 bands co-migrate) but not the cross-reactive polypeptide detected by the 5B9 monoclonal AUF1 antibody. Higher resolution of AUF1 proteins in SDS-10% PAGE suggests that the unknown protein that cross-reacts with the 5B9 antibody has a molecular mass of 46-47 kDa (Fig. 1B, right panel). These data therefore validate the use of the PcAb 995 antibody for this study. Antibodies were validated previously to KSRP (39Min H. Turck C.W. Nikolic J.M. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and HuR, which has shown some cross-reactivity to HuD and HelN1 (HuB) but not HuC (22Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Tissue Distribution of AUBP Proteins—Six-week-old male and female C57BL/6 mice (young adults) were sacrificed, and organs and tissues were rapidly dissected and either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, fixed in formalin, and embedded in paraffin or immediately processed for SDS-PAGE. For electrophoresis, whole cell extracts were prepared by mechanical disruption in homogenization buffer and clarified by centrifugation, and equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblot analysis was performed using primary antibodies as indicated and ECL for detection. Tissue Expression of HuR Protein—There are four members of the Hu family of RNA-binding proteins that participate in RNA processing events and ARE mRNA stability (reviewed in Ref. 40Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). HuB (HelN1), HuC, and HuD are developmentally regulated and tissue-restricted in expression, predominantly in the brain (40Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). HuR (also known as HuA) is expressed widely but at different levels in mammalian cell lines (22Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25Fan X.C. Steitz J.A.

However, a limited number of human and mouse tissues have been studied for HuR protein expression (22Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 41King P.H.

Neuroimmunol. 1998; 92: 152-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Studies have not investigated fully HuR protein expression levels in a variety of tissues from the adult mouse. Soluble whole cell protein extracts were prepared from male and female mouse tissues; organs were denatured and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and HuR was identified by immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody to HuR (3A2), which most strongly recognizes the HuR member of the Hu family but also cross-reacts with HuB and HuD (22Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Normalization to equal protein levels and the lack of protein degradation were reflected in similar total polypeptide levels (within 2-fold) by Ponceau S staining, permitting direct comparisons between tissues (Fig. 2C). Immunoblot staining of poly(A)-binding protein in tissues (Fig. 2D) demonstrated more specifically the lack of degradation of proteins and that similar (within 2-fold) levels were present in equal amounts of tissue protein extracts. Similar results were found for immunoblot analysis of tubulin proteins as well (data not shown). Thus, it is highly unlikely that differential protein degradation could occur in these rapidly frozen tissues. In both male and female young adult mice HuR was predominantly expressed in the intestine, thymus, and spleen, followed by the liver (Fig. 2, A and B). The significant expression of HuR in proliferating lymphocytic cells (43Atasoy U. Watson J. Patel D. Keene J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) could play a role in the high levels observed here. HuR was almost undetectable in the brain, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, and heart (Fig. 2, A and B), arguing against strong cross-reactivity of the 3A2 antibody with HuB, -C, or -D. In female mice, a low level of HuR expression was detected in the uterus and little in the ovary, whereas male mice expressed HuR strongly in the testes. These results are consistent with several reports demonstrating strong HuR expression in malignant murine lung and brain carcinomas but not in normal tissue (35Nabors L.B. Gillespie G.Y. Harkins L. King P.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2154-2161PubMed Google Scholar, 36Blaxall B.C. Dwyer-Nield L.D. Bauer A.K. Bohlmeyer T.J. Malkinson A.M. Port J.D. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A previous study (47Gouble A. Morello D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5377-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) of HuR protein tissue expression in the adult mouse reported strong expression in the spleen, thymus, and testes as found here but additionally showed strong expression in the brain, lung, and intestine. Thus, our studies concur with those of Gouble and Morello (47Gouble A. Morello D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5377-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), apart from the abundance of HuR in the brain. In this regard, a previous study (35Nabors L.B. Gillespie G.Y. Harkins L. King P.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2154-2161PubMed Google Scholar) reported strong HuR expression in brain tumors but not normal brain using a validated antibody to HuR, similar to our results. Because studies demonstrated that the adult mouse brain predominantly expresses HuC and -D forms of the Hu protein (48Okano H.J. Darnell R.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3024-3037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we suspect that reports of high levels of HuR protein in the brain more likely reflect cross-reactivity to HuC and -D neuronal forms. The analysis of HuR in a limited number of human tissues, using a commercial source of tissue, showed strong expression in the spleen and testes as found here in mouse tissue (the thymus was not investigated) but differed in finding strong expression in the brain, kidney, and lung (22Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), which might reflect species differences or differences in the amount of protein analyzed. It is also interesting to note that a survey of reported HuR protein and mRNA expression levels in tissues suggests a possible disparity, potentially implicating translational control or differential mRNA versus protein stabilities in HuR regulation. Tissue and Isoform Expression of AUF1 Proteins—AUF1 consists of four isoforms (p37, p40, p42, and p45) derived from the same mRNA by differential splicing (1Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The p37 and p40 isoforms are most closely associated with the promotion of ARE mRNA decay (14Brewer G. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W1966888005,"The cancer-prone and premature aging disease Werner syndrome is due to loss of WRN gene function. Cells lacking WRN demonstrate genomic instability, including telomeric abnormalities and undergo premature senescence, suggesting defects in telomere metabolism. This notion is strongly supported by our finding of physical and functional interactions between WRN and TRF2, a telomeric repeat binding factor essential for proper telomeric structure. TRF2 binds to DNA substrates containing telomeric repeats and facilitates their degradation specifically by WRN exonuclease activity. WRN and TRF2 also interact directly in the absence of DNA. These results suggest that TRF2 recruits WRN for accurate processing of telomeric structures in vivo. Thus, our findings link problems in telomere maintenance to both carcinogenesis and specific features of aging."
https://openalex.org/W1967084106,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the interaction of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1AR) carboxyl-terminal tail with Rab5a may modulate Rab5a activity, leading to the homotypic fusion of endocytic vesicles. Therefore, we have investigated whether AT1AR/Rab5a interactions mediate the retention of AT1AR·β-arrestin complexes in early endosomes and whether the overexpression of Rab7 and Rab11 GTPases influences AT1AR lysosomal degradation and plasma membrane recycling. We found that internalized AT1AR was retained in Rab5a-positive early endosomes and was neither targeted to lysosomes nor recycled back to the cell surface, whereas a mutant defective in Rab5a binding, AT1AR-(1-349), was targeted to lysosomes for degradation. However, the loss of Rab5a binding to the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail did not promote AT1AR recycling. Rather, it was the stable binding of β-arrestin to the AT1AR that prevented, at least in part, AT1AR recycling. The overexpression of wild-type Rab7 and Rab7-Q67L resulted in both increased AT1AR degradation and AT1AR targeting to lysosomes. The Rab7 expression-dependent transition of “putative” AT1AR·β-arrestin complexes to late endosomes was blocked by the expression of dominant-negative Rab5a-S34N. Rab11 overexpression established AT1AR recycling and promoted the redistribution of AT1AR·β-arrestin complexes from early to recycling endosomes. Taken together, our data suggest that Rab5, Rab7, and Rab11 work in concert with one another to regulate the intracellular trafficking patterns of the AT1AR.

The Rab7 expression-dependent transition of “putative” AT1AR·β-arrestin complexes to late endosomes was blocked by the expression of dominant-negative Rab5a-S34N. Rab11 overexpression established AT1AR recycling and promoted the redistribution of AT1AR·β-arrestin complexes from early to recycling endosomes. Taken together, our data suggest that Rab5, Rab7, and Rab11 work in concert with one another to regulate the intracellular trafficking patterns of the AT1AR. The angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1AR) 1The abbreviations used are: AT1AR, angiotensin II type 1A receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; AngII, angiotensin II; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: AT1AR, angiotensin II type 1A receptor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; AngII, angiotensin II; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor. is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, the largest family of integral membrane receptor proteins. The AT1AR is coupled via Gq to the stimulation of phospholipase Cβ, leading to increases in intracellular diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and the release of calcium from intracellular stores (1Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 639-672PubMed Google Scholar). Agonist activation of the AT1AR also leads to the desensitization of AT1AR second messenger responses and the removal of cell-surface AT1AR into the intracellular compartment of the cell (2Hunyady L. Bor M. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31378-31782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2040-2053PubMed Google Scholar). The agonist-stimulated desensitization and endocytosis of many GPCRs is initiated by GPCR kinase-mediated phosphorylation, followed by β-arrestin binding (5Ferguson S.S.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Both β-arrestin-dependent and β-arrestin-independent mechanisms of AT1AR endocytosis have been reported; and as such, the precise mechanism(s) regulating AT1AR internalization remain unclear (6Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 7Gaborik Z. Szaszak M. Szidonya L. Balla B. Paku S. Catt K.J. Clark A.J.L. Hunyady L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).The AT1AR is a member of a class of GPCRs that remain associated with β-arrestins following their endocytosis (4Anborgh P.H. Seachrist J.L. Dale L. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2040-2053PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Internalized AT1AR is targeted to enlarged hollow core vesicular structures, but is neither dephosphorylated nor efficiently recycled back to the cell surface (4Anborgh P.H. Seachrist J.L. Dale L. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2040-2053PubMed Google Scholar). The inability of the vasopressin V2 receptor to recycle back to the cell surface appears to be regulated, at least in part, by the stable formation of a complex between β-arrestin and the G protein receptor kinase-phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal tail of the receptor (9Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that the formation of stable GPCR·β-arrestin complexes in endosomes may prevent the GPCR recycling and resensitization (10Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, exceptions do exist because other GPCRs, such as the neurokinin-1 receptor, internalize in a complex with β-arrestin and are still efficiently recycled back to the plasma membrane (11Grady E.F. Garland A.M. Gamp P.D. Lovett M. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 509-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 12McConalogue K. Dery O. Lovett M. Wong H. Walsh J.H. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16257-16268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).The internalization and trafficking of GPCRs between intracellular membrane compartments play a crucial role in regulating the overall balance of GPCR activity by governing whether GPCRs are recycled back to the cell surface or degraded in lysosomes. Although the sorting of GPCRs between distinct intracellular membrane organelles, including early, recycling, and late endosomes, may be regulated in part by receptor/β-arrestin interactions, there is evidence that components of the endocytic machinery may directly influence the GPCR trafficking between these intracellular compartments. For example, AT1ARs preferentially traffic to Rab5-positive endosomal structures as a consequence of the agonist-dependent formation of AT1AR·Rab5a protein complexes and AT1AR-stimulated Rab5a GTP binding (13Seachrist J.L. Laporte S.A. Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Caron M.G. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the final intracellular destination of the AT1AR internalized to the Rab5-positive early endosomal compartment remains less clear.In this study, we examine 1) whether the association of Rab5a with the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail prevents the lysosomal degradation and/or plasma membrane recycling of the AT1AR and 2) whether the overexpression of Rab11 and Rab7 GTPases promotes AT1AR recycling and trafficking to late endosomes and lysosomes. We found that Rab5a binding to the carboxyl-terminal tail protected the AT1AR from lysosomal degradation, but did contribute to the regulation of AT1AR recycling. Moreover, Rab7 and Rab11 overexpression increased AT1AR targeting to lysosomes and recycling to the plasma membrane, suggesting that the relative level of Rab GTPase expression may influence the intracellular trafficking patterns and fate of GPCRs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were provided by American Type Culture Collection. The tissue culture medium was from Invitrogen. Bovine serum albumin was obtained from Bioshop Canada Inc. Mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody was from Amersham Biosciences. LysoTracker Red was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2, angiotensin II (AngII), isoproterenol, and all other biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma.DNA Construction—All recombinant cDNA procedures were carried out following standard protocols. The GFP-Rab7, GFP-Rab11, HA-Rab7, and HA-Rab11 constructs were made by PCR using the QUICK-Clone™ human universal cDNA library (Clontech). 5′-Oligonucleotide primers introduced an amino-terminal BamHI restriction site, and 3′-oligonucleotide primers introduced a carboxyl-terminal NotI site to allow the subcloning of the PCR product into the pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) mammalian expression vectors. YFP-Rab7 and YFP-Rab11 were constructed by subcloning BglII/ApaI-digested pcDNA3.1-HA-Rab7 and pcDNA3.1-HA-Rab11 into the pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech). The β-arrestin-2-YFP and the FLAG-AT1AR-AALAA mutant constructs were the generous gift of Drs. Stephane A. Laporte and Marc G. Caron. The GFP-Rab7-Q67L and GFP-Rab7-N125I constructs were the kind gift of Dr. Bo van Deurs. The Rab7-Q67L, Rab7-N125I, Rab11-Q70L, and Rab11-S25N mutations were created using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence integrity of the DNA constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All other cDNA constructs used have been reported previously (8Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G.

The cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 106/100-mm dish (Falcon) and were transiently transfected by a modified calcium phosphate method (14Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27221-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the cDNAs described in the figure legends. Following transfection (∼18 h), the cells were pooled and reseeded on 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes (Mattek Corp.) for confocal live cell imaging studies, on 12-well dishes (Falcon) for receptor recycling studies, or in 96-well dishes (Falcon) for receptor degradation assays. Receptor expression was 500-1000 fmol/mg of whole cell protein.Receptor Recycling Assays—Cells expressing HA epitope-tagged receptors were treated with and without agonist for 30 min at 37 °C, washed three times with serum-free medium, and either kept on ice or allowed to recover at 37 °C for 60 min. The cells were antibody-stained, and the cell-surface receptor density was determined by flow cytometry as described previously (15Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27221-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor recycling is defined as the recovery of cell-surface receptors accessible to antibodies outside the cell following the removal of agonist compared with the cell-surface expression of receptors in matched controls that were not exposed to agonist.Qualitative Receptor Degradation Assays—HEK 293 cells expressing FLAG epitope-tagged AT1AR were pretreated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C in HBSS containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide along with 100 nm AngII for 0, 2, or 4 h. The cells were subsequently washed on ice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (25 nm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 nm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The protein content of the cell lysates was determined using a Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit. FLAG-AT1AR was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody using protein G-Sepharose beads from cell lysates containing 500 μg of protein. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 10% milk in wash buffer (Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20) and then incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody diluted 1:1000 in wash buffer containing 3% milk. The membranes were rinsed and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody diluted 1:2500 in wash buffer containing 3% milk. The membranes were rinsed with wash buffer, incubated with ECL Western blot detection reagents, and then exposed to film.Quantitative Receptor Degradation Assays—Cell-surface FLAG epitope-tagged receptors were labeled for 1 h on ice with mouse anti-FLAG antibody diluted in HBSS. Cells were then washed and allowed to warm to 37 °C prior to treatment with and without 100 nm AngII for 90 min at 37 °C. Cells were subsequently fixed and permeabilized in 2% formaldehyde in HBSS and 0.1% saponin, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody to measure to the total cellular complement of FLAG epitope-tagged receptors. The total cellular complement of the remaining internalized cell-surface receptors was determined following a 20-min incubation of solubilized cells with the horseradish peroxidase substrate tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma). The reaction was stopped with 1 n HCl, and the absorbance of the supernatant at 450 nm was measured using a microplate luminescence reader. Receptor degradation is defined as the loss of horseradish peroxidase activity following agonist stimulation. Experiments were done in quadruplicate for each condition and were repeated at least six times.Rab7 Immunoblots—HA-Rab7 expression was confirmed by immunoblotting. In brief, 50 μg of protein from each of the cell lysates used for immunoprecipitation were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and subsequently immunoblotted for HA-Rab7 expression using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution).Live Cell Imaging with Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM-510 META laser-scanning microscope with a Zeiss 100 × 1.4 NA oil immersion lens. The Zeiss LSM-510 META system produces cross-talk-free images of fluorescent proteins (GFP and YFP) with closely overlapping emission spectra. This spectral analytical separation of GFP and YFP emission spectra functions to eliminate channel bleed-through. 2Available at www.zeiss.com. HEK 293 cells expressing either FLAG- or HA-tagged AT1AR and AT1AR-(1-349) together with GFP- and YFP-tagged Rab and β-arrestin constructs as described in the figure legends were plated on 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes, and live cell images were taken in the absence and presence of treatment with 100 nm AngII. Cells were loaded with 50 nm LysoTracker Red dye for 30 min at 37 °C following agonist stimulation to assess the co-localization of receptors in lysosomes. Co-localization studies of β-arrestin-2-GFP and LysoTracker Red-labeled lysosomes were performed using dual excitation (488 and 543 nm) and emission (505-530 nm, GFP; and 590-610 nm, LysoTracker Red) filter sets. The specificity of labeling and the absence of signal crossover were established by examination of single-labeled samples. Images showing λ scans of YFP- and GFP-expressing cells were unmixed using Zeiss LSM-510 META image processing software. 2Available at www.zeiss.com. For live cell receptor labeling, anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was conjugated to either Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 using a Zenon mouse IgG labeling kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.) following the manufacturer's directions. Cell-surface FLAG-AT1AR was labeled for 10 min at room temperature with Alexa Fluor-tagged anti-FLAG antibody diluted 1:500 in HBSS; and subsequently, the cells were washed with HBSS to remove any unbound antibody.Data Analysis—The means ± S.E. are shown for values obtained for the number of independent experiments indicated in the figure legends. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPAD Prism software. Statistical significance was determined by an unpaired two-tailed t test.RESULTSThe AT1AR Is Not Targeted to Lysosomes following Prolonged Agonist Treatment—Previous studies have demonstrated that the AT1AR does not efficiently recycle to the cell surface and is internalized as a complex with β-arrestin to enlarged Rab5-positive endocytic structures (4Anborgh P.H. Seachrist J.L. Dale L. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2040-2053PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether the AT1AR is either retained in early endosomes or is eventually targeted to lysosomes for degradation. To examine AT1AR targeting to lysosomes in live HEK 293 cells, we utilized the acidotropic lysosomal compartment probe LysoTracker Red (16Bucci C. Thomsen P. Nicoziani P. McCarthy J. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) in combination with β-arrestin-2-GFP to follow receptor trafficking (4Anborgh P.H. Seachrist J.L. Dale L. Ferguson S.S.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2040-2053PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the absence of agonist treatment, β-arrestin-2-GFP was diffusely localized throughout the cytoplasm, whereas LysoTracker Red stained punctuate vesicular structures within the cytosol of the cell (Fig. 1A). In response to a 3-h treatment of the same HEK 293 cell with 100 nm AngII, AT1AR·β-arrestin-2-GFP complexes internalized to large hollow core endosomal structures (Fig. 1B). Consistent with a previous study (13Seachrist J.L. Laporte S.A. Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Caron M.G. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), AT1AR·β-arrestin-2-YFP complexes extensively co-localized with GFP-Rab5a (Fig. 1C). However, even following 3 h of agonist stimulation, the AT1AR·β-arrestin complexes rarely co-localized with the lysosomal marker LysoTracker Red (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these observations indicate that internalized AT1AR is retained in a Rab5-positive early endosomal compartment and does not target to lysosomes for degradation.Rab5 Binding to the AT1AR Carboxyl-terminal Tail Prevents AT1AR Degradation—Truncation of the AT1AR carboxyl-terminal tail to create the AT1AR-(1-349) mutant lacking the distal 10 amino acid residues prevents Rab5 binding, but does not alter the stability of AT1AR·β-arrestin complexes (13Seachrist J.L. Laporte S.A. Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Caron M.G. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the AT1AR-(1-349) mutant only partially co-localizes with Rab5a in endocytic vesicles (13Seachrist J.L. Laporte S.A. Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Caron M.G. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the possibility that lost AT1AR-(1-349) binding to Rab5 may result in the lysosomal targeting of the mutant receptor. Following a 90-min exposure to 100 nm AngII, we observed substantial co-localization of AT1AR·β-arrestin-2-GFP with LysoTracker Red, whereas we did not observe co-localization between GFP-Rab5a and LysoTracker Red (Fig. 2, A and B). Agonist treatment of AT1AR-expressing HEK 293 cells for 2 and 4 h did not promote the degradation of the AT1AR (Fig. 3A). Moreover, only 14 ± 7% of the wild-type AT1AR was degraded following a 90-min exposure to 100 nm AngII, whereas 33 ± 8% of the total cellular complement of AT1AR-(1-349) was lost following a 90-min exposure to agonist (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, the truncation of the AT1AR tail, which impairs Rab5 interactions, also results in the targeting of the AT1AR to lysosomes for degradation.Fig. 2Co-localization of AT1AR-(1-349) mutant·β-arrestin-2 complexes and Rab5 with lysosomes.

Thomsen P. Nicoziani P. McCarthy J. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), we tested whether Rab7 overexpression might increase AT1AR degradation. Following Rab7 overexpression, agonist treatment of AT1AR-expressing HEK 293 cells for 2 and 4 h promoted significant AT1AR degradation (Fig. 3A). We found that the overexpression of either wild-type Rab7 or Rab7-Q67L increased wild-type AT1AR degradation to 29 ± 5 and 37 ± 7%, respectively (Fig. 3B). However, increased AT1AR degradation in response to 100 nm AngII treatment for 90 min was not observed following the overexpression of the dominant-negative Rab7-N125I mutant (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the extent of AT1AR-(1-349) mutant degradation following 90 min of agonist treatment was unaffected by Rab7 and Rab7-Q67L expression, but dominant-negative Rab7-N125I reduced AT1AR-(1-349) degradation to 11 ± 7% of the total cellular complement of the receptor (Fig. 3C). The overexpression of either Rab7 or Rab7-Q67L resulted in the co-localization of “putative” wild-type AT1AR·β-arrestin complexes with the lysosomal marker dye LysoTracker Red (Fig. 4, A and B). Although the overexpression of Rab7-N125I had no effect on the localization of the wild-type AT1AR·β-arrestin complexes, it prevented the redistribution of the AT1AR-(1-349) mutant·β-arrestin complexes to LysoTracker Red-positive lysosomes (Fig. 4, C and D). We have demonstrated that the AT1AR remains associated with β-arrestin following the internalization of the receptor (8Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), but this does not rule out the possibility that only β-arrestin is targeted to lysosomes following Rab7 expression. Furthermore, Bhatnagar et al. (17Bhatnagar A. Willins D.L. Gray J.A. Woods J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8269-8277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have reported previously that β-arrestin dissociates from the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2c receptor in the endosomal compartment. Therefore, we tested whether the AT1AR may be targeted to lysosomes following the prolonged treatment of cells with agonist. In the absence of agonist, AT1AR labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody was localized to the cell surface (Fig. 5A). Agonist treatment for 2 h resulted in the internalization of anti-FLAG antibody-labeled AT1AR to large hollow core vesicles, but the receptor did not co-localize with LysoTracker Red-positive lysosomes (Fig. 5B). However, identical to what was observed for AT1AR·β-arrestin complexes, the expression of both wild-type Rab7 and Rab7-Q79L resulted in the co-localization of the wild-type AT1AR with LysoTracker Red (Fig. 5, C and D). Thus, it is unlikely that the receptor and β-arrestin traffic to distinct compartments following Rab7 overexpression. Taken together, the data suggest that, although the AT1AR is normally retained within a Rab5-positive early endosomal compartment, increased Rab7 activity promotes the transition of the AT1AR from the early endosomal compartment to lysosomes.Fig. 4Co-localization of AT1AR·β-arrestin complexes with LysoTracker Red following the overexpression of Rab7, Rab7-Q67L, and Rab7-N125I.

https://openalex.org/W2032668695,"PDZ-RhoGEF, LARG, and p115RhoGEF are members of a newly identified family of Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) exhibiting a unique structural feature consisting of the presence of an area of similarity to regulators of G protein signaling (RGS). This RGS-like (RGL) domain provides a functional motif by which Gα12 and Gα13 can bind and regulate the activity of these RhoGEFs, thus providing a direct link from these heterotrimeric G proteins to Rho. PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG can also be phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases, including FAK, and associate with Plexin B, a semaphorin receptor, which controls axon guidance during development, through their PDZ domain, thereby stimulating Rho. Interestingly, while characterizing a PDZ-RhoGEF antiserum, we found that a transfected PDZ-RhoGEF construct associated with the endogenous PDZ-RhoGEF. Indeed, we observed that PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG can form homo- and hetero-oligomers, whereas p115RhoGEF can only homo-oligomerize, and that this intermolecular interaction was mediated by their unique C-terminal regions. Deletion of the C-terminal tail of PDZ-RhoGEF had no significant effect on the GEF catalytic activity towards Rho in vitro, but resulted in a drastic increase in the ability to stimulate a serum response element reporter and the accumulation of the GTP-bound Rho in vivo. Furthermore, removal of the C-termini of each of the three RGL-containing GEFs unleashed their full transforming potential. Together, these findings suggest the existence of a novel mechanism controlling the activity of PDZ-RhoGEF, LARG, and p115RhoGEF, which involves homo- and hetero-oligomerization through their inhibitory C-terminal region."
https://openalex.org/W2165075179,"PLAG1 is a proto-oncogene whose ectopic expression can trigger the development of pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary glands and of lipoblastomas. As PLAG1 is a transcription factor, able to activate transcription through the binding to the consensus sequence GRGGC(N)6–8GGG, its ectopic expression presumably results in the deregulation of target genes, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. The identification of PLAG1 target genes is therefore a crucial step in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in PLAG1-induced tumorigenesis. To this end, we analysed the changes in gene expression caused by the conditional induction of PLAG1 expression in fetal kidney 293 cell lines. Using oligonucleotide microarray analyses of about 12 000 genes, we consistently identified 47 genes induced and 12 genes repressed by PLAG1. One of the largest classes identified as upregulated PLAG1 targets consists of growth factors such as the insulin-like growth factor II and the cytokine-like factor 1. The in silico search for PLAG1 consensus sequences in the promoter of the upregulated genes reveals that a large proportion of them harbor several copies of the PLAG1-binding motif, suggesting that they represent direct PLAG1 targets. Our approach was complemented by the comparison of the expression profiles of pleomorphic adenomas induced by PLAG1 versus normal salivary glands. Concordance between these two sets of experiments pinpointed 12 genes that were significantly and consistently upregulated in pleomorphic adenomas and in PLAG1-expressing cells, identifying them as putative PLAG1 targets in these tumors."

Here we identify the minimal portions of two of these aptamers that retain binding specificity. We determine their secondary structures by a combination of modeling and solution probing.

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) 1The abbreviations used are: TSE, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy; SA, streptavidin. involve spongiform degeneration and astrocyte gliosis in the central nervous system leading to dementia and death (1Hur K. Kim J.I. Choi S.I. Choi E.K. Carp R.I. Kim Y.S. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 1637-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). They can have genetic, sporadic, or infectious etiologies, exemplified by fatal familial insomnia, sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, respectively. They all involve the modification of prion precursor protein PrPc, which is constitutively expressed in mammalian cells, particularly neurons, as a GPI-anchored plasma membrane glycoprotein. During many TSE diseases, infectivity is found to be associated with amyloid deposits of PrP, in a form referred to as PrPSc (2Prusiner S.B. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Groth D.F. Glenner G.G. Cell. 1983; 35: 349-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), and lack of a gene for PrP renders animals insusceptible to prion diseases (3Prusiner S.B. Groth D. Serban A. Koehler R. Foster D. Torchia M. Burton D. Yang S.L. DeArmond S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10608-10612Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 4Bueler H.

These and related observations support the prion theory of TSE etiology, in which self-templated conformational changes in PrP are necessary and sufficient for disease progression and transmission (5Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar). The encipherment of the pathological properties of TSEs within the conformation of PrP is not fully understood, but whereas the membrane-proximal domain of PrPc is mainly α-helical in structure, PrPsc is dominated by β-sheets (6Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). In contrast to PrPC, PrPsc is insoluble in nondenaturing conditions and is partially resistant to proteases (7Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar). Diagnostic tests for the in vivo identification of prions are not yet ideal. Disease cannot be confirmed until clinical signs appear or even until a post mortem of brain tissue shows spongiform changes and prion accumulation using immunohistochemical methods. Only recently has it been possible to isolate antibodies that are able to differentiate between PrPc and PrPsc (8Paramithiotis E. Pinard M. Lawton T. LaBoissiere S. Leathers V.L. Zou W.Q. Estey L.A. Lamontagne J. Lehto M.T. Kondejewski L.H. Francoeur G.P. Papadopoulos M. Haghighat A. Spatz S.J. Head M. Will R. Ironside J. O'Rourke K. Tonelli Q. Ledebur H.C. Chakrabartty A. Cashman N.R. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), so current methods rely on a pretreatment with protease, which may obscure the presence of relevant, protease-sensitive conformations. The most promising of diagnostic tests have been using fluorescence, such as multi-spectral ultraviolet fluorescence looking at specific fluorescence of proteins when excited by UV radiation (9Rubenstein R. Gray P.C. Wehlburg C.M. Wagner J.S. Tisone G.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, which recognizes single fluorescent molecules in solution as they pass between the exciting laser beam and the objective of a confocal microscope (10Bieschke J. Giese A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Zerr I. Poser S. Eigen M. Kretzschmar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5468-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Another interesting approach by Safar et al. (11Safar J.G. Scott M. Monaghan J. Deering C. Didorenko S. Vergara J. Ball H. Legname G. Leclerc E. Solforosi L. Serban H. Groth D. Burton D.R. Prusiner S.B. Williamson R.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1147-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) is that of a conformation-dependent immunoassay; this uniquely quantifies PrP isoforms by the binding pattern of different antibodies to both denatured and native forms. There has been some evidence that PrPsc can be detected in the blood of infected rodents (12Brown P. Cervenakova L. McShane L.M. Barber P. Rubenstein R. Drohan W.N. Transfusion. 1999; 39: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 13Brown P. Rohwer R.G. Dunstan B.C. MacAuley C. Gajdusek D.C. Drohan W.N. Transfusion. 1998; 38: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), as well as in the urine of scrapie-infected hamsters (14Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The amount of PrPsc outside the central nervous system is very small compared with that in the brain, so it might be necessary to amplify the small amount there using, for example, the cyclic PrPsc amplification process (15Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). For a review of these and other diagnostic assays see Ref. 16Ingrosso L. Vetrugno V. Cardone F. Pocchiari M. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 273-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar. Given the limitations of antibodies, aptamers provide an alternative approach to the ligand-based detection of PrPsc. Aptamers are nucleic acids isolated in vitro for their ability to bind a molecule of interest by the SELEX procedure (17Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8166) Google Scholar). This involves cycles of binding and amplification starting from about 1014 different nucleic acid molecules, which eventually results in the isolation of a few sequences that have good affinity for targets such as CD4 (18Kraus E. James W. Barclay A.N. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5209-5212PubMed Google Scholar), streptavidin (19Tahiri-Alaoui A. Frigotto L. Manville N. Ibrahim J. Romby P. James W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and HIV-1 gp120 (20Sayer N. Ibrahim J. Turner K. Tahiri-Alaoui A. James W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Khati M. Schumann M. Ibrahim J. Sattentau Q. Gordon S. James W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12692-12698Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Protein binding by aptamers results mainly from hydrogen bonds and electrostatic forces, which means that the best targets are often basic, positively charged molecules. Aptamers can have a subnanomolar affinity and a high specificity (for a review see Ref. 22James W. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), Because of the number of different potential ligands that can be screened by the SELEX process, aptamers have often been raised against molecules when other approaches have failed. They have many advantages over antibodies in that they are nonimmunogenic, smaller, and usually of a better affinity and can be chemically synthesized. This, together with their contrasting physico-chemical properties to antibodies, makes aptamers potentially useful reagents for the detection of previously overlooked conformations of PrP. We have recently described the isolation of 2′-fluoropyrimidine-substituted RNA aptamers that were selected from randomized libraries using infectious prions as the target material (23Rhie A. Kirby L. Sayer N. Wellesley R. Disterer P. Sylvester I. Gill A. Hope J. James W. Tahiri-Alaoui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39697-39705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). One of these aptamers, SAF-93 was shown to bind to two regions of PrP: (i) a conformationally insensitive, diffuse region lying between residues 23 and 110 that binds nonspecifically to nucleic acids and (ii) a site lying between residues 110 and 230. The latter site was occluded in the normal α-helix-rich conformation of the protein but exposed in the disease-associated β-sheet-rich forms and was not bound by control nucleic acids. SAF-93 also inhibited the conversion of α helix-rich to β sheet-rich forms in a prion-nucleated, in vitro conversion assay (23Rhie A. Kirby L. Sayer N. Wellesley R. Disterer P. Sylvester I. Gill A. Hope J. James W. Tahiri-Alaoui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39697-39705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). SAF-93 is therefore an interesting ligand for PrP and may reveal conformations of PrP not yet identified. Before the properties of this and another aptamer, SAF-76 (also described in this paper), could be exploited, more information was required about the structural features essential for their binding to prions. In this paper, we present the results of experiments designed to facilitate the use of prion-binding aptamers as molecular reagents for the investigation of prion diseases. Firstly we determined the solution structure of the aptamers and mapped the binding motifs onto the determined structure. We then characterized the minimal structural features that were responsible for specific binding and designed a novel method for determining a residue within the essential structure of the best aptamer that could be modified without affecting its affinity for PrP. With this information, we went on to synthesize modified aptamers for a range of analytical and diagnostic applications. Protein Preparation and Refolding—Full-length bovine PrP, corresponding to residues 23-230 (human numbering) was cloned, expressed, and purified as described before (23Rhie A. Kirby L. Sayer N. Wellesley R. Disterer P. Sylvester I. Gill A. Hope J. James W. Tahiri-Alaoui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39697-39705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from inclusion bodies by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography and reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The purified PrP was refolded into native α-helical conformation or β-oligomeric isoform following the protocol described in Ref. 24Baskakov I.V. Legname G. Baldwin M.A. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21140-21148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar. Finally, the monomeric α-helical rich form and β-oligomer isoform of PrP were purified by high performance size exclusion chromatography (23Rhie A. Kirby L. Sayer N. Wellesley R. Disterer P. Sylvester I. Gill A. Hope J. James W. Tahiri-Alaoui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39697-39705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The protein structures were checked using CD, as previously described (23Rhie A. Kirby L. Sayer N. Wellesley R. Disterer P. Sylvester I. Gill A. Hope J. James W. Tahiri-Alaoui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39697-39705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription—Transcription of 2′-fluoropyrimidine-containing RNA was carried out largely as described in Ref. 25Heidenreich O. Kang S.H. Brown D.A. Xu X. Swiderski P. Rossi J.J. Eckstein F. Nerenberg M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2223-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar. Briefly, transcription by T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was incubated at 37 °C for at least 6 h in 40 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 6 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm spermidine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm NTPs. The products were then treated for 30 min at 37 °C with 50 units of DNase 1 (Roche Applied Science) in 150 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 10 mm magnesium chloride. The reaction was stopped by phenol extraction, and the transcript was recovered by ethanol precipitation. 32P End Labeling of RNA—For 5′ labeling, the terminal 5′ phosphate was removed using bacterial alkaline phosphatase (New England Bio-labs) and replaced with [32P]phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science). Labeling at the 3′ end was achieved by ligating [32P]pCp to the 3′ end of the aptamer using T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Ligation was carried out for 2 h at 37 °C. The labeled RNAs were electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels, visualized by autoradiography, and recovered by passive elution from gel slices. Identification of the Core Binding Sequence Using Boundary Experiments—A library of nested deletion fragments was generated from either 3′ or 5′ end-labeled aptamer by mild alkaline hydrolysis (26Aurup H. Williams D.M. Eckstein F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9636-9641Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and partitioned into PrP-binding and nonbinding fractions using Strata-Clean™ (Stratagene), as described before (20Sayer N. Ibrahim J. Turner K. Tahiri-Alaoui A. James W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 924-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The products were analyzed by denaturing 18% PAGE. Enzymatic Probing and Footprinting—32P end-labeled RNA was digested in 1× HMNK, pH 7.2, buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm potassium chloride, 5 mm magnesium chloride, 0.04% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 μg of tRNA at 20 °C for 5 min with either nuclease V1 (Pierce; 5 × 10-3 unit) or S1 (Amersham Biosciences; 0.05 unit). Footprinting was achieved by incubating an identical aptamer preparation with prion protein for 1 h at 25 °C and then subjecting the mixture to appropriate nuclease digestion. The digestions were terminated by phenol extraction. The RNA was precipitated using ethanol, then dissolved in formamide buffer, and analyzed by denaturing PAGE (see below). Urea-denaturing PAGE of 32P-Labeled RNA—All of the samples for truncation and footprinting analysis were heated to 95 °C for 3 min in formamide loading buffer and run on 40-cm-long 18% or 20% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels at 25 watts for 3 h. A partial alkaline hydrolysate of the RNA along with a G residue ladder was run alongside analysis samples to aid sequence identification. The G residue ladder was generated by digestion of 50,000 cpm (Cerenkov) denatured RNA at 55 °C in 10 μl of 20 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm EDTA, 7 m urea, pH 4.6, with RNase T1 (Amersham Biosciences; 5 × 10-3 units). Binding Affinity of Aptamers—End-labeled aptamer (5000 cpm; Cerenkov) was heat-denatured at 95 °C for 2 min in water, cooled to room temperature, and refolded in 1× AMNK buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 100 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm potassium chloride, 5 mm magnesium chloride, 0.04% Nonidet P-40) for 10 min. After refolding, the aptamer was incubated with different concentrations of prion protein in the presence of 1 μg of tRNA in 30 μl for 1 h at 25 °C. The bound RNA was then separated from unbound using 0.1 volume of StrataClean™ resin and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 3 min, and the supernatant (containing unbound RNA) was removed. The resin was washed with 30 μl of 1× AMNK buffer and again centrifuged (the wash was pooled with the unbound RNA). The resin (complexed with PrP-bound RNA) was resuspended in 60 μl of 1× AMNK buffer, and the amounts of radioactivity corresponding to PrP-bound and unbound RNA were measured for each concentration of protein. The data were fitted using nonlinear curve fitting to a hyperbolic equation by Graph Pad Prism. Identification of Sites at Which Incorporation of Biotin Does Not Interfere with PrP Binding—Transcription of aptamer was done as described above, with the addition of 2 μm biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Applied Science). After completion, the transcription was dialyzed against water for 3 h instead of phenol extraction to remove nonincorporated 5-allyl biotinyl UTP. To isolate molecules that could bind a single streptavidin tetramer, the dephosphorylated, biotinylated RNA was incubated for 30 min with 30 μl of streptavidin (2 mg/ml). The complex was then run on an 8% Tris-borate native polyacrylamide gel, and the band corresponding to aptamer bound to one tetramer of streptavidin was cut out, passively eluted from the gel, and ethanol-precipitated. The gel-purified and biotinylated RNA was then 5′ end radiolabeled as described above. The double-labeled RNA was ethanol-precipitated and complexed with streptavidin as before. The complex was then incubated with 40 μl of β-form PrP90-230 (1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 25 °C. The ternary complex (PrP-aptamer-streptavidin) was then partitioned from the binary complex (aptamer-streptavidin) using StrataClean™ resin (to which streptavidin does not bind). RNA was recovered from both fractions, partially hydrolyzed using alkali, and analyzed by urea-denaturing PAGE, as described above, along with a transcript without biotin incorporated as a control. Slot Blots Using Chemically Synthesized Biotinylated Aptamer—30 pmol of full-length PrP was bound to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (equilibrated in 0.8% (v/v) acetic acid, 350 mm β alanine) by applying a vacuum. The membrane with protein attached was then washed with Tris-buffered saline-Tween and 10 mm magnesium chloride and then prehybridized in the same buffer with the addition of 5% milk powder and 20 μg/ml tRNA for 1 h. The membrane was then incubated overnight in 20 pmol of SAF-93(1-34,35bU,36-60), (chemically synthesized and biotin derivitized at position 35) that had been refolded in 1× HMNK and added to 20 ml of Tris-buffered saline-Tween, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 5% milk powder, 20 μg/ml tRNA. The membrane was blocked again for 1 h, washed, incubated in presence of streptavidin alkaline phosphatase (0.25 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 30 min, washed, and then developed using enzyme chemifluorescence substrate as described before. All of the incubations were carried out at 25 °C. Primary and Secondary Structure Determination of SAF-76 and SAF93—To elucidate their secondary structures, SAF-76 and SAF-93 were transcribed in vitro, purified, labeled at the 5′ end with 32P, and refolded. They were then subjected to limiting digestion using the structure-sensitive nucleases S1 (preference for single-stranded regions) and V1 (preference for double-stranded regions) (27Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehres-mann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) and analyzed using denaturing PAGE, as described (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results (see supplemental figures) were used to constrain the MFOLD helix prediction algorithm (28Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10406) Google Scholar) and to eliminate the suboptimal structures that were inconsistent with experimentally determined structural features. The most empirically compliant structures are illustrated in Fig. 1 (A and B). It must be noted that RNA structures are often dynamic (29Nguyen D.H. DeFina S.C. Fink W.H. Dieckmann T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 15081-15084Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Aptamers, which have been selected for their ability to bind to a target protein with good affinity, may not always be fully structured in the absence of protein. For this reason, even though multiple repetitions of these experiments gave entirely consistent results, we cannot be categorical that these putative secondary structures are as well determined as, say, those of tRNAs. With these caveats, the aptamers appear to fold into two and three helical domains, respectively, separated by extended, nonhelical regions. That is, SAF-76 appears to comprise two domains consisting of helices 1, 2, and 3 and of helices 4, 5, and 6, respectively, and SAF-93 appears to comprise three domains consisting of helix 1, of helices 2, 3, and 4, and of helix 5, respectively. It seemed very possible that only one of these domains in each case was actually necessary for interaction with PrP, particularly because the aptamers are relatively long (117 and 116 nucleotides, respectively). Accordingly, we determined the 3′ boundary of the PrP-binding regions of each by separating a partial hydrolysate of 5′-labeled full-length aptamer into PrP-binding and non-PrP-binding fractions and analyzing each by urea-denaturing PAGE (Fig. 1, C and D). In each case, an approximate 3′ boundary could be identified as the point at which the intensity of fragments in the lane of nonbinding RNA became greater than that in the lane of PrP-binding RNA, as indicated in Fig. 1. Again, it should be noted that even very short fragments retain some binding to PrP, probably through the nonspecific interaction with the N-terminal tail of the protein. This results in a slight blurring of the boundary between the essential and inessential regions of aptamer. Nevertheless, in both cases, it seemed possible to eliminate a substantial 3′ portion of the aptamer without loss of PrP binding. When the 3′ boundaries were placed on the secondary structure previously determined, a paradox immediately presented itself in both cases. In SAF-76 helix 1 was split by the 3′ boundary, and in SAF-93 helix 2 was split by the 3′ boundary. That is, in each case, only one-half of a predicted helix remained in the 3′-truncated, PrP-binding aptamer. Three explanations seemed possible. First, the actual secondary structures might be very different from those presented. This could result from a large number of noncanonical, tertiary interactions stabilizing much weaker canonical helices than had been considered by the MFOLD algorithm. Second, the truncated aptamer might still bind to PrP but with much reduced affinity, as a result of the loss of one helix. Third, the truncated aptamer might fold into an altogether different structure from its full-length parent. To resolve these possibilities, we used the primary and secondary structure information to generate defined, truncated aptamers and analyzed both their affinity for PrP and their secondary structures. Structure and Affinity of Truncated Aptamers—The double-stranded DNA template used to transcribe the parental aptamers in vitro was amplified using the standard 5′ SELEX primer together with a 3′ primer corresponding to the 3′ boundary determined above. The parental aptamers and their truncated derivatives are hereinafter named to indicate the nucleotides retained from the parent. These truncated derivatives were then analyzed by enzymatic probing as described previously. Again the experiments were repeated a number of times to ensure that the cleavages shown were consistent. SAF-76(1-38) showed anomalous nuclease sensitivity when compared with its parent, SAF-76(1-117) (Fig. 2A). Nucleotides that had formerly appeared to be single-stranded were now sensitive to nuclease V1, whereas those previously showing signs of double-strandedness were now sensitive to nuclease S1, making the parent-like structure shown in Fig. 2A untenable. When we constrained the modeling of SAF-76(1-38) by MFOLD with the new data, the structure shown in Fig. 2B emerged. Intriguingly, this contains secondary structural features found within the 5′ region of SAF-93, with which it shows some sequence homology. When we compared the affinity of the truncated aptamer with its parent (Fig. 2C), it appeared that removal of the 3′ portion reduced the affinity of SAF-76 for α-form PrP but maintained its affinity for β-form PrP. This is consistent with the idea that binding to the α-form is dominated by nonspecific nucleic acid interactions in the unstructured N terminus of PrP, which would lessen as the length of the RNA decreased. Although the conformational specificity of SAF-76(1-38) to β-oligomeric form PrP was improved compared with the full-length aptamer, its affinity was still weaker than that of aptamer SAF-93. We constructed three deletion mutants of SAF-93. The first, SAF-93(1-60), was based on the 3′ boundary determined above. The second, SAF-93(3G,28-60), was, in addition, truncated at the 5′, in accordance with indications from a 5′ boundary experiment (data not shown), thereby removing helix 1. The third, SAF-93(1-33,43-45,48-51), was designed to preserve helix 1, shorten helix 3, and remove sequences corresponding to the “half-helix” 2. Nuclease sensitivity experiments, together with computer modeling, indicated that the secondary structure of each of these truncated aptamers was as anticipated (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, nucleotides 31 and 32 of SAF-93(1-60), which had appeared to be in helix 2 of the full-length SAF-93(1-116), were still sensitive to nuclease V1 in the truncated version, in which helix 2 could not form. This is strong evidence for stable, noncanonical interactions between this region and some other portion within the 5′ half of SAF-93. When we measured the affinity of the truncated versions of SAF-93 for both conformations of PrP, we found that removal of the 3′ half to generate SAF-93(1-60) had little effect on the binding to the α-form while slightly improving the affinity for the β-oligomeric form (Fig. 2E). The shortening of helix 3 and removal of region 2 in SAF-93(1-33,43-45,48-51), reduced the binding affinity for the β- oligomeric form of PrP. However, destruction of helix 1 in SAF-93(3G,28-60) and disruption of region 2, comprising presumptively tertiary structure, effectively destroyed the specificity of binding to β-form PrP. These results correlate with the footprinting studies on SAF-93(1-60), which showed that much of the sequence was protected by binding to β-form PrP (see supplemental figures). Taken together, the results show that SAF-93(1-60) defines a minimal, conformationally selective aptamer for PrP and comprises two helices bounding a region of tertiary structure. Generation of an Internally Derivitized Aptamer for PrP Detection—One consequence of the minimization procedure above was that relatively little of SAF-93(1-60) was free to interact with bulky molecules such as streptavidin once it was bound to β-form PrP, as indicated by the footprinting results (see supplemental figures). This was disadvantageous in many potential applications of aptamer technology. Indeed, introduction of a biotin at the 3′ end, the most convenient position for site-specific, post-transcriptional incorporation, resulted in a ligand that, when complexed with streptavidin, had very poor PrP binding characteristics (data not shown). Consequently, we undertook a systematic search for internal uracils that could be so derivitized without detriment. We exploited the fact that all of the uracils in SAF-93(1-60) were part of the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide, 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine. This means that, in the unmodified SAF-93(1-60), a partial alkaline hydrolysate of 5′-labeled aptamer gives a purine ladder, and bands corresponding to U are absent. On the other hand, biotinylated uracil was associated with 2′ OH 5-allyl-biotinyl uridine, which is readily cleaved by alkali, producing an additional band at any U position into which it is incorporated. We spiked transcription of SAF-93(1-60) with 2 μm 5-allyl-biotinyl UTP to produce an average incorporation rate of one biotinylated uracil/molecule, presumably at random, at the nine available positions. We then complexed the partially biotinylated RNA with streptavidin (SA) and purified the RNA that was bound to one SA tetramer from that which bound none, two, or more molecules of SA. We then incubated the SA-aptamer complex with PrP and partitioned the PrP-binding complexes using the resin StrataClean™, which fortuitously binds PrP but not SA. We subjected the PrP-binding and nonbinding complexes to partial alkaline hydrolysis and analyzed them on denaturing PAGE (Fig. 3, A and B). The results show that the most 5′-proximal uracil that can be derivitized with biotin-streptavidin while retaining its PrP binding properties is U35. In the 5′ region of U35, the hydrolysis ladder is identical in both the biotin-SA-PrP-binding sample and the control sample. However, in the 3′ end of U35, there is an additional cleavage event in the biotin-SA-PrP-binding sample, the bands migrate more slowly (by approximately one nucleotide equivalent) and are less distinct than in the control sample. This is consistent with the incorporation of an additional 487 Da (corresponding to allyl-biotin) and the replacement of 2′-fluoro with 2′OH at position 35. Because of the resolution of the gel, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that uracils 3′ to U35 could also be derivitized in this way without loss of function. To test whether our interpretation of this experiment was correct, we chemically synthesized an aptamer corresponding to the sequence identified above, namely SAF-93(1-34,35bioU,36-60) and determined its affinity for the two isoforms of PrP when complexed with streptavidin. The results show that, as anticipated, the affinity of the aptamer for β-form PrP was the same in the absence as in the presence of streptavidin: Kd = 8.4 ± 1.4 and 6.8 ± 2.9 nm, respectively (Fig. 4A). This aptamer was then used to probe slot blots of PrP in either the β-oligomeric or α-monomeric conformation (Fig. 4B). The aptamer detected the β-form much more effectively than the α-form and did not bind to an equivalent amount of human serum albumin. We have recently described aptamers that bind a region of PrP that is intimately involved in the conformational shifts that occur in the generation of prions and can inhibit conversion in cell-free assays systems (23Rhie A. Kirby L. Sayer N. Wellesley R. Disterer P. Sylvester I. Gill A. Hope J. James W. Tahiri-Alaoui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39697-39705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although the original aptamers had many promising features, for example, their resistance to degradation conferred by 2′-fluoro substitution, they were not ideally suited to analytical or therapeutic applications because of their length and complexity. Accordingly, we have used a range of experimental and computational tools to define the essential functional structures of two prion-binding aptamers. By analyzing the functional primary and secondary structure of the original 116-nucleotide-long aptamer using a range of techniques, we have been able to preserve its conformational specificity while reducing it to a size suitable for chemical synthesis. Moreover, using a new method for screening internal modifications, we have been able to derivitize it with biotin to generate a ligand that can readily be applied in multiple detection formats. The synthetic aptamer described here (SAF-93(1-34,35bioU,36-60)) is a novel and promising tool for the investigation of PrP isoforms in vivo. For example, it could be used as a detection reagent in slot or dot blotting applications, as shown here. Specifically, one could envisage applying multiple samples of blood, cerebro-spinal fluid, brain homogenate, or other biological materials in parallel to a polyvinylidene difluoride or similar support membrane. SAF-93(1-34,35bioU,36-60) could then be used to develop the membrane, followed by detection using enzyme-conjugated streptavidin and chemoluminescent, chemofluorescent, or chromogenic imaging. Perhaps more conveniently, high throughput plate format assays could be developed in which aptamer-derivitized assay plates are used to capture abnormal PrP from biological samples. Detection of the captured PrP could again by through the use of SAF-93(1-34,35bioU,36-60) and any of the proprietary streptavidin-based systems. More biologically informative uses include the replacement of anti-PrP antibodies with SAF-93(1-34,35bioU,36-60) in histochemical analysis of biopsy and post mortem samples of experimentally infected model animals or suspect cases. Certain investigations that are not possible using currently available antibodies might become possible using the aptamer. For example, the specificity of SAF-93(1-34,35bioU,36-60) for abnormally folded PrP does not depend on the resistance of the protein to proteinase K. This means that putative forms of PrP that are abnormally folded and either infectious or pathogenic but not fully resistant to PK could be sought directly. Moreover, because the selective reactivity of abnormally folded PrP for aptamer is expressed under native conditions and does not require the presence of denaturants, as is commonly the case with antibody-based systems, the aptamer approach opens the way for a simpler exploration of the appearance of infectious material in vivo under conditions in which classic PrPSc is not presently detectable.

https://openalex.org/W2056185128,"Sodium butyrate (NaB) has been proposed as a potential anticancer agent. However, its mechanism of action is not totally elucidated. Here, we showed that NaB-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were associated with an increase of P21waf1/cip1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. This increase was more important in the nuclei, as revealed by immunofluorescence analysis. Transient transfections of MCF-7 cells with p21 deficient for interaction with CDK, but not with p21 deficient for interaction with PCNA (p21PCNA−), abrogated NaB-induced cell cycle arrest. This indicated that cell cycle blockage involved the interaction of P21waf1/cip1 with CDK. However, P21waf1/cip1 was dispensable, since p21 antisense did not modify cell cycle arrest. On the other hand, NaB-induced apoptosis was abolished by p21 antisense or p21PCNA−. In addition, NaB decreased PCNA levels, but increased the association of PCNA with P21waf1/cip1. These results suggested that NaB-induced apoptosis required P21waf1/cip1 and its interaction with PCNA."

Invest. 2000; 106: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar) revealed a developmental role of S1P in the vascular maturation; in mice with disruption of the S1P1 receptor gene, perivascular accumulation of VSMCs and pericytes at the fetal developmental stage was defective. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A and -B chains induce a diverse array of cellular responses including cell proliferation, migration, and cell survival in a variety of mesenchymal cell types (11Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Especially, PDGF-B chain has been implicated in the formation of various types of vascular proliferative lesions including atherosclerosis, intimal smooth muscle cell accumulation after angioplasty and in grafted vessels, and accelerated arteriosclerosis in transplanted organs (12Ross R. Nature. 1995; 362: 801-809Crossref Scopus (9989) Google Scholar, 13Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 445-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Besides the pathogenetic roles of PDGFs and PDGF receptors, developmental roles of PDGFs during fetal morphogenesis were demonstrated; it was shown that mice with ablation of either PDGF-B chain gene or PDGF-B chain-specific receptor PDGF-β gene exhibited defects in recruitment and differentiation of vascular mural cells, i.e. vascular remodeling and maturation, after the initial endothelial tube formation (14Hellstrom M. Kalen M. Lindahl P. Abramsson A. Betsholtz C. Development. 1999; 126: 3047-3055PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that the homozygous null mutation of PDGF-A gene led to impaired development of alveolar myofibroblasts (15Bostrom H. Willetts K. Pekny M. Leveen P. Lindaht P. Hedstrand H. Pekna M.

Despite the potential importance of PDGFs in vascular occlusive diseases and a variety of physiological processes, only a little is known about the regulator of PDGF expression until recently. We and others have previously shown that angiotensin II, which was implicated in neointima formation after vascular injury, induced expression of PDGF-A and -B in VSMCs (16Deguchi J. Makuuchi M. Nakaoka T. Collins T. Takuwa Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Itoh H. Mukoyama M. Pratt R.E. Gibbons G.M. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2268-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). However, it is largely unknown whether at all and how other extracellular mediators are involved in the regulation of PDGF expression under pathological and physiological conditions. In the present study, we demonstrated that S1P potently stimulates PDGF-A and -B chain mRNA and protein expression in VSMCs. Our results suggest that S1P1 receptor is a major isoform to mediate this S1P action. We also show that the stimulatory action of S1P1 is relayed via Gi, Ras, and other small G proteins, and their downstream protein kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Rho kinase. The transcription factor Krüppel-like factor (KLF)-5/IKLF/BTEB2 belongs to the family of mammalian Krüppel-like transcription factors (18Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). KLF5 is implicated in phenotypic changes of activated VSMCs, which include alterations in the gene expression, in the site of vascular injury (19Watanabe N. Kurbayashi M. Shimomura Y. Kawai-Kowase K.

Med. 2002; 8: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ablation of KLF5 gene suppressed vascular injury-induced vascular proliferative lesion formation. We observed that KLF5 stimulated PDGF-A and -B chain gene expression in a cis-element-dependent manner and that suppression of S1P-induced KLF5 expression by RNA interference abrogated PDGF mRNA and protein expression. Thus, the present study demonstrates the novel role of S1P-Edg receptor system in the stimulatory regulation of PDGFs, which is exerted at the transcriptional level through mechanisms involving the up-regulation of KLF5.

Briefly, cell extracts prepared in the same way as for RhoA and Rac were incubated with GST-c-Raf-(51–101) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed as described for RhoA and Rac assay, and Ras bound to beads was analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-Ras antibody (Transduction Laboratories). A portion (1/100) of cell extracts was also analyzed for the amount of total Ras by Western blotting. The quantification of small G proteins was performed by densitometry as described for MAPK activities in the present study.

The cells were infected with adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of ∼100, and allowed to recover in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum for 3 h, and then serum-deprived before experiments, as described previously (9Ryu Y.

The PDGF-B promoter reporter vector Sis-Luc, which contains a 1.0-kilobase pair fragment (–956 to +45 as indicated as the number of base pairs upstream of the TATA box) of the mouse PDGF-B promoter, was described previously (16Deguchi J. Makuuchi M. Nakaoka T. Collins T. Takuwa Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Sis-Luc with mutations in the potential KLF5-binding sites was created by a PCR-based method (24Mitui H. Takuwa N. Kurokawa K. Exton J.H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol.

N-terminally HA-tagged S1P1 cDNA was generated by the PCR-based method and ligated onto the mammalian expression vector pME18S at the EcoRI-SpeI sites. β-Galactosidase expression vector, pCAGGS-LacZ, was kindly donated by Dr. I. Saito (University of Tokyo, Institute of Medical Sciences, Tokyo, Japan). The Ras-binding domain (amino acids 51–101) of human c-Raf was obtained by RT-PCR and ligated onto pGEX-2T at the BamHI-EcoRI sites. Rat KLF5 cDNA (19Watanabe N. Kurbayashi M. Shimomura Y.

RNA Interference—Small interfering RNA duplexes (siRNA) were synthesized by in vitro transcription of RNA from short DNA templates carrying T7 promoter sequences, using a Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion). The targeted sequences of S1P1 and KLF5 were 5′-AACTGACTTCAGTGGTGTTCA-3′ (nucleotides 140–160 of rat S1P1) and 5′-AAATTTACCTGCCACTCTGCC-3′ (nucleotides 990–1010 of rat KLF5), respectively. The information of the targeted S1P1 sequence was kindly provided by Ji-Hye Paik (University of Connecticut, Farmington, CT). The nucleotide sequences in sense strands of scrambled RNA duplex were 5′-AATCGCATAGCGTATGTCGTT-3′ (for S1P1) and 5′-TCACGCAGTCATCAACCCTTT-3′ (for KLF5). The synthesized 21-mer sense and antisense RNA strands were hybridized. The VSMCs, which were in a subconfluent state, were transfected by incubating the cells for 4 h with siRNA duplexes at the final concentrations of 25 nm in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) by employing OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen), according to the instructions from the manufacturer. After transfection, fetal calf serum-containing DMEM was added to make a final serum concentration of 10% and incubated for 18 h. The cells were then switched to serum-free DMEM, and 24 h later the cells were used for experiments. PDGF-B Promotor Assay—Newborn RASM cells were co-transfected with Sis-Luc and either of the expression vectors encoding KLF5 or an empty vector (pME18S), using LipofectAMINE as described previously (16Deguchi J. Makuuchi M. Nakaoka T. Collins T. Takuwa Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to recover after transfection for 3 h in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and then serum-deprived for 48 h. Cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured with a Lumat LB95001 luminometer (Berthold) using the luciferase assay system (Promega), as described previously (16Deguchi J.

Luciferase activity was normalized for β-galactosidase activity measured in parallel cultures co-transfected with the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pSV-βgal and either of the expression vectors or empty vector. PDGF Protein Analysis—Proteins in the conditioned media collected from newborn RASM cells were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by Western analysis using anti-PDGF-A chain and -B chain-specific antibodies, as described previously (16Deguchi J. Makuuchi M. Nakaoka T. Collins T. Takuwa Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Statistics—The data are presented as the means ± S.E. of three or more determinations. The statistical significance of differences between the two groups was determined by Student's t test, whereas multiple comparisons were analyzed by Scheffe's test. S1P Up-regulates PDGF mRNA Expression in Newborn RASM and Neointimal VSMCs, but Not in 8W-RASM Cells—Newborn RASM expressed a low level of PDGF-B chain mRNA at quiescent states. Stimulation with S1P (100 nm) induced a marked increase in PDGF-B mRNA level, which peaked after 4 h and gradually declined thereafter, but remained elevated for at least 8 h (Fig. 1A, upper). S1P stimulation did not alter GAPDH gene expression. The PDGF-B gene mRNA level normalized for GAPDH mRNA level showed a maximal 5-fold increase above the unstimulated level (Fig. 1A, bottom). Neointimal VSMCs derived from the neointima of injured artery (16Deguchi J. Makuuchi M. Nakaoka T. Collins T. Takuwa Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) also responded to S1P with induction of PDGF-B mRNA, with a similar time course and to comparable extents as newborn RASM. In RASM cells from an 8-week-old rat (8W-RASM), by contrast, S1P failed to induce any increase in PDGF-B gene expression over the basal unstimulated level. PDGF-A chain mRNA level was in a detectable level in quiescent newborn RASM cells (Fig. 1A). S1P stimulated PDGF-A chain mRNA with a maximal 5-fold increase in newborn RASM cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, the stimulatory effect of S1P on PDGF-B expression in newborn RASM increased dose-dependently with half-maximal and maximal effects obtained at 100 nm and 1 μm, respectively. Besides S1P, dihydro-S1P and, to a lesser extent, sphingosylphosphorylcholine, both of which are weak agonists for S1P receptors (8Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yokomizo T. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S.

Other sphingolipids, including sphingosine and sphingomyelin, which are not S1P receptor agonists, or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which is an agonist for LPA receptor subfamily of the Edg G protein-coupled receptor family (3Fukushima N. Ishii I. Contos J.J.A. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 2001; 131: 767-771Google Scholar), did not induce PDGF-B mRNA expression under our experimental condition (up to 1 μm). Northern analyses of total cellular RNA revealed that newborn and 8W-RASM as well as neointimal VSMCs expressed comparable levels of S1P2 and S1P3 mRNAs (Fig. 1D). However, the expression levels of S1P1 mRNA were quite different among the three cell types; it was abundant in newborn RASM and neointimal VSMCs, whereas it was barely detectable, if any, in 8W-RASM. The results in neointimal cells are consistent with a previous report (5Kluk M.J. Hla T. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The mRNAs of S1P4 or S1P5 were not detectable in either cell type. Newborn RASM cells were stimulated with S1P or left un-stimulated for 4 h, and then actinomycin D, a transcription inhibitor, was added (0 time points) (Fig. 1E). The PDGF-B mRNA level was then monitored over the next 4 h. The PDGF-B mRNA levels in both cell groups decayed with time at comparable rates, with the half-life being 83 and 76 min in the absence and presence of S1P, respectively. The results suggest that S1P up-regulates PDGF-B mRNA level mainly by stimulating transcription, rather than by inhibiting degradation. S1P1 Mediate"

https://openalex.org/W2013024179,"Angiogenic factors alter endothelial cell phenotype to promote the formation of new blood vessels, a process critical for a number of normal and pathological conditions. Ras is required for the induction of the angiogenic phenotype in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, VEGF generates many signals, several of which are not dependent upon Ras activation. Our current study investigates the sufficiency of Ras activation for driving angiogenic responses. An activated Ras(V12) mutant induces prominent membrane ruffling, branching morphogenesis on three-dimensional collagen, DNA synthesis, and cell migration in primary endothelial cells. An upregulation of PI3K/AKT, Erk, and Jnk signaling pathways accompany these phenotypic changes. The inhibition of Erk blocked cell proliferation, but only partially attenuated migration. Blocking PI3K had no effect on DNA synthesis, but caused a modest reduction in cell migration. Lastly, Jnk played a significant role in both the proliferation and migration response. These effects of Ras(V12) are not the result of increased autocrine secretion of VEGF. These data suggest that the acquisition of activating Ras mutations can lead to a proangiogenic conversion in the phenotype of primary endothelial cells. Furthermore, these data raise the possibility that chronic Ras activation in endothelial cells may be sufficient to promote angiogenesis and the development of vascular anomalies."
https://openalex.org/W2074022052,"Neuroblastoma is a heterogeneous tumor consisting of N (neuronal) and S (stromal) cells. We report that more tumorigenic and motile N cells express higher levels of IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) than less tumorigenic, more adherent S cells. Shc, one of the two major docking partners of IGF-IR, is equally expressed in N and S cell lines. IGF-I treatment phosphorylates Shc in N cells, but only weakly activates Shc in S cells. Expression of the second partner, insulin receptor substrate (IRS), is cell type specific. S cells exclusively express IRS-1 that undergoes sustained phosphorylation by IGF-I. In contrast, N cells express IRS-2 that is transiently phosphorylated by IGF-I. Downstream of IRS-2 and Shc, IGF-I treatment results in strong activation of Akt and MAPK in N cells and activation of both pathways is required for IGF-I-mediated differentiation. Only IGF-IR activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase is required for tumor edge ruffling in N and S cells, with stimulation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin. This detailed understanding of the 'biochemical signature' of N and S cells provides the background needed to target and disrupt specific IGF signaling pathways in an attempt to develop more effective therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2046620012,"While melanomas are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this intrinsic resistance. Here, we describe the utilization of retroviral insertional mutagenesis to facilitate the analysis of genetic changes that are associated with radioresistance in human melanoma. A radial growth phase human melanoma cell line, WM35, was infected with a replication-defective amphotropic murine retrovirus and subsequently selected for X-ray radiation-resistant variants. Several radiation-resistant clones were independently isolated and characterized. Interestingly, these clones also displayed resistance to ultraviolet radiation and to the chemotherapeutic drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP). By Northern and Western analyses, we showed that the expression of DOPAchrome tautomerase (DCT), also known as tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TYRP2), an enzyme that functions in eumelanin synthesis, was significantly elevated in the radiation-resistant clones relative to the parental WM35 cells. Moreover, the levels of DCT in a variety of human melanoma cell lines correlated with their relative levels of radioresistance and the enforced expression of DCT conferred increased resistance to UV(B) treatment. An analysis of stress signaling induced by radiation as well other cytotoxic stressors showed that resistance associated with DCT overexpression applied specifically to treatments that activate the ERK/MAPK pathway. Indeed, DCT overexpression in a melanoma cell line resulted in increased ERK activity. Moreover, ectopic expression of dominant-active MEK in this melanoma cell line conferred UV(B) resistance suggesting that the ERK/MAPK pathway downstream of DCT may play a critical role in radiation and drug resistance. Overall, given that each gamma- and UV(B)-resistant cell line also exhibited resistance to CDDP and that CDDP-resistant clones showed increased resistance to UV(B) irradiation, these results suggest a common mechanism underlying radio- and chemoresistance, which is mediated by DCT expression."
https://openalex.org/W2041183187,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Deregulation of cell-cycle control is thought to be a crucial event in malignant transformation, and CDC25 phosphatases are a family of cyclin-dependent kinase activators, which act at different points of the cell cycle, including G1-S and G2-M transition. Here, we investigated the expression and functional significance of CDC25s in PDAC. CDC25B mRNA expression levels in human pancreatic tissue samples were analysed by cDNA array, quantitative PCR and Northern blotting. Immunohistochemistry was carried out to localize and quantify CDC25B expression. Two specific CDC25B inhibitors were utilized to determine the functional relevance of CDC25B. By quantitative RT-PCR, CDC25B mRNA was overexpressed in pancreatic cancer (7.5-fold) in comparison to the normal pancreas. Strong nuclear CDC25B immunoreactivity was present in both pancreatic and metastatic cancer samples, and there was a marked increase of the percentage of positive cells in primary cancer (48.6+/-16.3%) and metastatic tissues (71.7+/-3.1%) compared to normal samples (8.3+/-1.8%). Two CDC25B inhibitors reduced the growth of pancreatic cancer cell lines, resulting in the accumulation of phosphorylated CDC2 and G2/M arrest. These findings demonstrate an important role of CDC25B in cell-cycle progression, raising the possibility that inhibition of CDC25B may have therapeutic potential in pancreatic cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2029467771,"Vimentin exhibits a complex pattern of developmental- and tissue-specific expression and is aberrantly expressed in most metastatic tumors. The human vimentin promoter contains multiple DNA elements, some of which enhance gene expression and one that inhibits. A silencer element (at -319) binds the repressor ZBP-89. Further upstream (at -757) is an element, which acts positively in the presence of the silencer element and, thus, is referred to as an antisilencer (ASE). Previously, we showed that Stat1alpha binds to this element upon induction by IFN-gamma. However, substantial binding and reporter gene activity was still present in nontreated cells. Here, we have found that Stat3 binds to the ASE element in vitro. Transfection experiments in COS-1 cells with various vimentin promoter--reporter constructs show that gene activity is dependent upon the cotransfection and activation of Stat3. Moreover, activated Stat3 can overcome ZBP-89 repression. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that Stat3 and ZBP-89 can interact and confocal microscopy detects these factors to be colocalized in the nucleus. Moreover, a correlation exists between the presence of activated Stat3 and vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is lacking in MCF7 cells where vimentin is not expressed. In the light of these results, we propose that the interaction of Stat3 and ZBP-89 may be crucial for overcoming the effects of the repressor ZBP-89, which suggests a novel mode for Stat3 gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W2052180464,"p16INK4a (hereafter referred to as p16), a major cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, is the product of a tumor-suppressor gene that has been found inactivated in different cancer types. In the present study, we sought to investigate the role of p16 in apoptosis induced by ultraviolet light (the most important etiological cause of skin cancer) and cisplatin (an anticancer DNA damaging agent). It is clearly shown that p16-compromised osteosarcoma U2OS cell line and p16−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts are sensitive to UV-induced apoptosis, as compared to their respective isogenic p16-expressing cells (EH1, EH2) and p16 +/+, indicating that p16 protects cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to UV light. Importantly, this reduction in UV-mediated apoptosis was associated with downregulation of the proapoptotic Bax protein, with no effect on Bcl-2 expression, suggesting that this antiapoptotic role of p16 is mediated via the intrinsic-mitochondrial pathway. On the other hand, p16 sensitized cells to cisplatin-mediated apoptosis through Bcl-2 decline. Interestingly, only proliferating but not G1-arrested EH1 cells underwent apoptosis in response to the anticancer drug. These novel findings provide further insight into the role of p16 in carcinogenesis, and has potential implications for future therapy strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2089890756,"Androgen receptor trapped clone-27 (ART-27) is a newly described transcriptional coactivator that binds to the N terminus of the androgen receptor (AR). Given the vital importance of AR signaling in prostate growth and differentiation, we investigated the role of ART-27 in these processes. Immunohistochemical studies indicate that ART-27 protein is expressed in differentiated epithelial cells of adult human prostate and breast tissue. In prostate, ART-27 is abundant in AR-positive prostate luminal epithelial cells, in contrast to the stroma, where cells express AR but not ART-27. The use of a rat model of androgen depletion/reconstitution indicates that ART-27 expression is associated with the elaboration of differentiated prostate epithelial cells. Interestingly, regulated expression of ART-27 in the androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cell line inhibits androgen-mediated cellular proliferation and enhances androgen-mediated transcription of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene. Consistent with a growth suppressive function, we show that ART-27 expression levels are negligible in human prostate cancer. Importantly, examination of ART-27 protein expression in early fetal prostate development demonstrates that ART-27 is detected only when the developing prostate gland has proceeded from a solid mass of undifferentiated cells to a stage in which differentiated luminal epithelial cells are evident. Thus, ART-27 is an AR cofactor shown to be subject to both cell type and developmental regulation in humans. Overall, the results suggest that decreased levels of ART-27 protein in prostate cancer tissue may occur as a result of de-differentiation, and indicate that ART-27 is likely to regulate a subset of AR-responsive genes important to prostate growth suppression and differentiation.

Current therapy for metastatic prostate cancer includes injections of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues to pharmacologically lower testosterone levels (androgen ablation), treatment with anti-androgens such as flutamide or bicalutamide, to block testosterone binding to the AR, or a maximal androgen blockade in which both treatments are combined. While such therapies are effective in the short term, cancers treated in this fashion will inevitably progress in an androgen-independent fashion. An important determinant of AR transactivation function resides in the N terminus (1Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7341-7346Google Scholar, 13Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 510-518Google Scholar, 14Rundlett S.E. Wu X.P. Miesfeld R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 708-714Google Scholar). The AR N-terminal residues 142–485 have been shown to activate a minimal promoter construct in a cell-free transcription system and to selectively interact with the transcription factors TFIIF and the TATA-binding protein (TBP), suggesting direct contact with general transcription factors (15McEwan I.J.

A growing list of proteins has also been reported to interact with the AR N terminus (15McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8485-8490Google Scholar, 17Lee D.K.

The clinical importance of investigating the biological role of coactivators that bind the AR N terminus is underscored by a recent report describing a patient diagnosed with complete androgen insensitivity, but exhibiting no mutation in AR. The study suggested that a coactivator interacting with the N-terminal region of AR, apparently essential for genital development, was lacking in this patient (23Adachi M. Takayanagi R. Tomura A. Imasaki K. Kato S. Goto K. Yanase T. Ikuyama S. Nawata H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 856-862Google Scholar). The work described in this article investigates the biological role of the newly described androgen receptor coactivator, androgen receptor trapped clone-27 (ART-27). ART-27 binds to the AR N terminus and facilitates receptor dependent transcriptional activation. The ART-27 clone was isolated from an androgen-stimulated LNCaP cell cDNA library in a two-hybrid screen designed to identify proteins that interacted with the AR-N terminus (24Markus S.M. Taneja S.S. Logan S.K. Li W. Ha S. Hittelman A.B. Rogatsky I. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 670-682Google Scholar) and was previously cloned in an exontrapping experiment (25Schroer A. Schneider S. Ropers H. Nothwang H. Genomics. 1999; 56: 340-343Google Scholar). The ART-27 gene encodes a protein of 157 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 18 kDa. Functional characterization of ART-27 indicates that it is a nuclear protein that interacts with N-terminal rat AR amino acids 153–336, containing AF-1a and a part of AF-1b (24Markus S.M. Taneja S.S. Logan S.K. Li W. Ha S. Hittelman A.B. Rogatsky I. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 670-682Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis of ART-27 indicates that it interacts with AR in nuclear extracts from LNCaP cells in a ligand-independent manner. In addition, ART-27 increases the transcriptional potency of AR when overexpressed in a variety of cultured mammalian cells. Mechanistically, ART-27 is likely to function as part of a transcription complex since analysis of ART-27 behavior in density gradient sedimentation of HeLa nuclear cell extracts indicates that it co-sediments as part of a larger complex (24Markus S.M. Taneja S.S. Logan S.K. Li W. Ha S. Hittelman A.B. Rogatsky I. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 670-682Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which ART-27 functions as a transcriptional activator is unclear, it is likely that ART-27 acts as an adapter to assemble protein complexes at androgen-responsive promoters. Steroid receptor coactivators and corepressors are likely important determinants of the response of a given hormone receptor in a given cellular context. As androgen stimulation results in differing cellular responses at various stages of prostate development and malignant transformation, we investigated the role of ART-27 in prostate epithelial cells. Construction of Plasmids—The ART-27 GST fusion construct was made by isolating full-length ART-27 as a EcoR1/XhoI fragment from pEG202 and subcloning into EcoR1/XhoI sites in pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). FLAG-tagged ART-27 and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ART-27 were made by subcloning the ART-27 EcoR1/XhoI fragment into a pcDNA3 vector with an N-terminal HA epitope (pcDNA3-HA) or into a pcDNA3 vector with a C-terminal FLAG epitope (pcDNA3-FLAG). Generation of Anti-ART-27 Polyclonal Antibodies—Generation of C-terminal anti-ART-27 antibodies has been previously described (24Markus S.M. Taneja S.S. Logan S.K. Li W. Ha S. Hittelman A.B. Rogatsky I. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 670-682Google Scholar). C-terminal antibodies were affinity-purified by isolation of the IgG fraction on a protein A Sepharose column, followed by affinity purification using Affi-gel 15 resin (Bio-Rad) coupled to the ART-27 peptide immunogen. Antibody was eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.7, and immediately neutralized. Antibodies against the ART-27-GST fusion protein were made by immunizing rabbits with the purified protein (Covance Research Products, Denver, PA). Immunohistochemistry—All human samples were used with approval of the New York University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Tissues utilized were obtained from paraffin-embedded archived radical prostatectomy or prostate needle biopsy samples. Immunohistochemistry was performed using either affinity purified C-terminal ART-27 antibody or AR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology AR polyclonal N-20). Tissue sections were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4. For antigen retrieval, paraffin sections were heated in a microwave oven (900 watts) in citrate buffer, followed by treatment with 3% H2O2 and blocking with 20% normal goat serum. Sections were then incubated with affinity-purified ART-27 (1:100) or AR antibody (1:200) followed by incubation with a biotinylated rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Labs). Prostate specimens from 9 human fetuses 9.5–24 weeks of gestational age were obtained following surgical abortion performed for reasons unrelated to this investigation. Approval for the collection of specimens was obtained by the New York University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained for all specimens. Age of specimens were estimated by heel-toe length and based on the last menstrual period. Prostates were formalin-fixed and oriented in paraffin blocks. Rat Model of Androgen Depletion/Reconstitution—Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (228–250 grams) were obtained from Taconic (Germantown, NY). Two control rats were sacrificed on day 0 and ventral prostates harvested. The remaining rats were anesthetized and castrated on day 0. Subsequently, two ventral prostates were harvested at 96 h. In addition, at the 96-h postcastration time point, the remaining rats were implanted with 25 mg, 21-day release testosterone pellets (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL). Two ventral prostates were then harvested at 24 and 48 h following testosterone supplementation. The weights of the prostates indicated that tissue volume substantially diminished upon androgen depletion. Generation of tet-ART-27 Cells—Tetracycline-inducible cell lines expressing a FLAG epitope-tagged ART-27 gene were made in LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells were first transfected with the pTet-On vector using DOTAP (Roche Applied Science), and resistant colonies were selected in 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Clones were transferred to 24-well dishes coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml; Invitrogen), expanded and screened for Tet-dependent activation by measuring pRevTRE-luciferase reporter gene activity. A LNCaP clone displaying tight Tet-dependent activation was transfected with pRevTRE:ART-27 (C-FLAG) prior to selection of resistant colonies in 150 μg/ml hygromycin B. Approximately 70 clones were expanded and grown in the presence and absence of doxycycline. Cell lysates were made and subjected to Western blot analysis to determine which cell lines showed doxycycline-regulated ART-27 FLAG expression. Anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) was used for Western blot analysis. Thymidine Incorporation—LNCaP cell clones were plated in 24-well plates in RPMI 1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum. The following day (T = 0), cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and medium changed to RPMI 1640 (without phenol red) + 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (cFBS) ± 1 μg/ml doxycycline and ± R1881. Media was changed every 24 h during the duration of the experiment. [H3]thymidine (2 μCi) was added to fresh medium and incubated with cells for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed, methanol-fixed, and solubilized prior to scintillation counting. Reverse Transcription (RT) and PCR (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated from ART-27 FLAG clone 1 cells using the RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was performed using the C. therm. Polymerase One-Step RT-PCR System (Roche Applied Science). Primer pair sequences are as follows: PSA Forward, 5′-TGCGCAAGTTCACCCTCA; PSA Reverse, 5′-CCCTCTCCTTACTTCATC (26Takahashi T. Hoshi S. Satoh M. Kaneda T. Suzuki K.I. Nakagawara K.I. Orikasa S. Int. J. Urol. 1999; 6: 526-531Google Scholar); RPL19 Forward, 5′-ATGTATCACAGCCTGTACCTG; RPL19 Reverse, 5′-TTCTTGGTCTCTTCCTCCTTG (27Rogatsky I. Wang J.C. Derynck M.K. Nonaka D.F. Khodabakhsh D.B. Haqq C.M. Darimont B.D. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13845-13850Google Scholar). The expected sizes for PSA and RPL19 are 752 bp and 233 bp, respectively. PCR parameters were optimized for each primer pair to ensure PCR products were in the linear range. Reverse transcription was performed at 60 °C for 30 min for PSA and RPL19. 75 ng of RNA were used for the amplification of PSA. Reverse transcription was followed by denaturation at 94 °C, annealing at 51 °C and extension at 72 °C for 25 cycles. For RPL19, 50 ng of RNA were used for reverse transcription followed by denaturation at 94 °C, annealing at 60 °C, and extension at 72 °C for 26 cycles. ART-27 Is Expressed in Epithelial Cells of Human Prostate and Breast Tissues—To evaluate the biological role of ART-27, polyclonal antibodies were developed so that the cell and tissue-specific expression pattern of ART-27 could be determined in vivo. Characterization of anti-ART-27 polyclonal antibodies is shown in Fig. 1. Cells were transfected with tagged ART-27, and lysates were either immunoprecipitated with antibody against ART-27 or the tag or used directly for Western blot analysis. Fig. 1A (top panel) shows that a polyclonal antibody made against the C-terminal peptide of ART-27 recognizes overexpressed FLAG-tagged ART-27 (lanes 1 and 5), overexpressed HA-tagged ART-27 (lanes 2 and 6) as well as endogenous ART-27 protein (lanes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7). A second polyclonal antibody made against full-length ART-27-glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein similarly recognizes these proteins (Fig. 1A, bottom panel) and confirms the identity of ART-27 protein. To verify detection of endogenous ART-27 protein, an untagged variant of ART-27 was expressed and compared with expression of endogenous ART-27 (Fig. 1B). The results establish that endogenous ART-27 is the same size as the untagged ART-27 and that the antibody is capable of specifically recognizing overexpressed and endogenous ART-27. As expected, the immune, but not the preimmune antisera recognizes ART-27 protein (Fig. 1C). To determine the cell type specificity of ART-27 expression compared with AR expression, ART-27 and AR antibodies were separately incubated with freshly cut paraffin sections of human prostate and breast tissue. Consecutive sections from each tissue were analyzed. Both ART-27 and AR are predominantly expressed in nuclei of differentiated epithelial cells of human prostate tissue. AR is almost exclusively nuclear, while ART-27 immunoreactivity appears to be present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (see higher magnification insets, Fig. 2, A and B). In breast tissue, once again, AR and ART-27 are both expressed in nuclei of epithelial cells. However, AR appears to be more abundant in the distal regions of the gland (observed as the smaller round gland indicated by the arrow in Fig. 2E) than in the more proximal part of the gland (the large central gland), while ART-27 protein appears to be abundant in both regions. Neither protein is ubiquitously expressed in epithelial cells of all tissue types, however, because there is little positive immunoreactivity in epithelial cells of the colon (not shown). As a control for antibody specificity, tissues were incubated in the presence of the primary antibody plus the immunizing peptide; these tissues show no immunoreactivity indicating that all of the observable staining is due to antibody recognition of the ART-27 C-terminal peptide. Additionally, incubation of the sections with secondary antibody only (Fig. 2, C and F) indicates that the secondary antibody does not contribute to the observed staining pattern. Therefore, the pattern of ART-27 protein expression is epithelial cell-specific. Closer examination of immunoreactivity with the ART-27 antibody in human prostate tissue sections shows strong epithelial cell staining and little to none in the stroma of adult human prostate tissue (Fig. 3A). To further verify the cell type specificity of ART-27 protein expression, Western blot analysis was performed using lysates from explant cultures of primary human epithelial and stromal cells (28Walden P.D. Ittmann M. Monaco M.E. Lepor H. Prostate. 1998; 34: 241-250Google Scholar). Consistent with the immunohistochemistry results, ART-27 is highly expressed in epithelial cells and expressed at low levels, if at all, in stromal cells (Fig. 3B). ART-27 Is Expressed in Rat Prostate Epithelial Cells Undergoing Androgen-dependent Proliferation—Since studies in human prostate tissue (above) indicated that ART-27 and AR are both expressed in prostate epithelial cells, a rat model of androgen depletion/reconstitution was used to examine the effects of androgen-mediated prostate growth and differentiation on ART-27 protein expression (29Colombel M.C. Buttyan R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 369-385Google Scholar). Similar to the expression of ART-27 in human prostate tissue, immunohistochemistry performed on rat prostate tissue samples indicated that ART-27 protein is expressed in prostate luminal epithelial cells, but not in stromal cells (Fig. 4A). To androgen-deprive the animals, rats were castrated to cause withdrawal of testicular androgens and regression of the prostate gland. Androgens were then re-administered for 24 and 48 h, resulting in cellular proliferation and growth of the prostate. Prostate glands were dissected from the animals at the indicated time points, and lysates were prepared from each gland and used for Western blot analysis. The filters were incubated with antibodies against ART-27 as well as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, a marker for cellular proliferation), clusterin (a protein that increases upon prostate involution and apoptosis, Refs. 30Buttyan R. Olsson C.A. Pintar J. Chang C. Bandyk M. Ng P.Y. Sawczuk I.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3473-3481Google Scholar, 31Lakins J. Bennett S.A. Chen J.H. Arnold J.M. Morrissey C. Wong P. O'Sullivan J.

Endocrinol. 2000; 167: 197-204Google Scholar), and MAPK (used as an internal loading control). Following castration, PCNA expression is abolished and clusterin expression is greatly increased, supporting the induction of apoptosis in the prostate epithelium (Fig. 4B, cas). Upon administration of exogenous androgens, PCNA levels are increased with rapid reduction of clusterin expression, thereby confirming the mitotic role of androgens in this model (A24 and A48). ART-27 protein is dramatically reduced following androgen withdrawal (cas), but is abundant when androgens are available (con, A24 and A48). Although it is not evident in this figure, longer exposure of the film from the blot incubated with ART-27 antibody does detect ART-27 in the samples from the castrated animals (cas). Therefore, in this model, the expression of ART-27 is associated with an abundance of differentiated prostate epithelial cells and is reduced along with diminishing numbers of epithelial cells under conditions of androgen deprivation. Subsequent experiments were designed to determine if ART-27 may play a role in androgen-dependent prostate growth and/or differentiation. Regulated Expression of ART-27 in the Androgen-sensitive LNCaP Cell Line Causes Decreased Cell Proliferation—To determine the effects of ART-27 on prostate cancer cell growth we constructed stable cell lines that express an epitope-tagged variant of ART-27 under the regulation of a tetracycline promoter in androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Parental LNCaP cells were transfected with the pTet-On vector and resulting clones were screened for Tet-dependent activation by measuring pRevTRE-luciferase reporter gene activity. A LNCaP clone displaying tight Tet-dependent activation was then transfected with pRevTRE:ART-27 (C-FLAG) prior to selection of resistant colonies. Fig. 5A shows expression of endogenous (ART-27) and ART-27 (C-FLAG) mRNA in one of the resulting clones in the presence and absence of R1881 and the tetracycline analog, doxycycline, as examined by Northern blot analysis. As expected, ART-27 (C-FLAG) rev/tet mRNA is up-regulated in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 4). However, neither endogenous ART-27 RNA levels (lower arrow) or ART-27 (C-FLAG) rev/tet RNA (upper arrow) levels are changed in response to the presence or absence of androgens (compare lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 3 and 4) indicating that androgens do not regulate the transcription of ART-27. Since subsequent experiments were designed to look at the effect of exogenous ART-27 on androgen mediated cell growth in LNCaP cells it was first determined if endogenous ART-27 protein levels are regulated by androgens, as might be suggested by the depletion of ART-27 protein levels in the castrated rat prostate cell lysates (Fig. 4B). For this purpose, ART-27 protein levels were determined in parental LNCaP cells in the presence and absence of R1881 (Fig. 5B). Western blot analysis of lysates made from androgen starved or androgen stimulated LNCaP prostate cancer cells is shown in Fig. 5B. The abundance of ART-27 protein in androgen-starved cells (Fig. 5B, lane 1) is identical to the levels of ART-27 in androgen-treated LNCaP cells (Fig. 5B, lane 2) suggesting that androgens do not affect the steady state levels of ART-27 protein. Analysis of ART-27-FLAG protein expression in response to doxycycline is shown in Fig. 6A. As expected, treatment of an ART-27-FLAG clone 1 with increasing concentrations of doxycycline results in higher levels of ART-27 protein expression. As a preliminary step to the thymidine uptake experiments described below, it was also determined that endogenous levels of AR expression are not affected by treatment of the cell clones with doxycycline (Fig. 6B). To determine the effect of ART-27 on androgen-mediated LNCaP cell proliferation, DNA synthesis was determined by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into cellular DNA. Fig. 6 (C and D) shows analysis of ART-27-FLAG clone 1 (C) and clone 2 (D) in the presence and absence of doxycycline and R1881. Both clones demonstrate regulation of ART-27-FLAG in response to doxycycline. Fig. 6C shows a representative experiment in which [3H]thymidine was added to the cells 1 h prior to sample analysis. As expected, there is very little incorporation of thymidine into DNA in the absence of androgens whether the cells are treated with doxycycline or not (Fig. 6C, 0 nm conditions). In the presence of R1881 (Fig. 6C, 0.05 nm) thymidine is incorporated into the cellular DNA as expected. However, cells expressing ART-27 FLAG (0.05 nm +Dox) show diminished thymidine incorporation compared with those that do not (0.05 nm-Dox) at the 48-h and 72-h treatment with R1881. Analysis of an additional clone (ART-27-FLAG clone 2) shows a similar trend (Fig. 6D). Again the cells show thymidine incorporation in response to androgens (compare 0 nm -Dox to 0.05 nm -Dox). In this clone, expression of ART-27-FLAG in the presence of 0.05 nm R1881 (0.05 nm +Dox) also reduces thymidine uptake compared with the cells grown in the absence of ART-27-FLAG (0.05 nm -Dox). In fact, in clone 2, the presence of ART-27-FLAG thymidine uptake is reduced to levels seen in the 0 nm R1881 condition (compare 0.05 nm +Dox to 0 nm +Dox). As a control it was shown that doxycycline alone at the concentration utilized does not inhibit parental LNCaP cell thymidine uptake (not shown). The decreased ability of ART-27-FLAG LNCaP cell clones to synthesize DNA in the presence of doxycycline induced ART-27 gene expression is corroborated by the fact that we were not able to make stable LNCaP cell lines that overexpressed ART-27 constitutively. In these experiments ART-27 was subcloned into the pIRESneo2 vector (Clontech) that utilizes an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to express the protein of interest (ART-27) on the same transcript as a selectable marker (neomycin). While hundreds of LNCaP colonies grew upon selection when transfected with pIRESneo2 alone, no colonies were evident on plates transfected with ART-27-pIRESneo2, again suggesting that increased levels of ART-27 protein inhibit or prevent LNCaP cell growth. To determine if ART-27-mediated LNCaP cell growth suppression is linked to the up-regulation of androgen-responsive genes involved in differentiated cell function, we examined the effect of PSA gene transcription in the presence and absence of doxycycline and R1881 by RT-PCR. PSA is an AR target gene and product of differentiated epithelial cells. Fig. 6E shows the DNA analysis of PCR products generated in RT-PCR reactions using primers for either the PSA gene or the ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19) gene included as a reaction and loading control. The doxycycline-inducible ART-27 FLAG clone 1 was grown in 0.05 nm R1881 and treated with either doxycycline or R1881 for 72 or 120 h as indicated. Cells were treated with 0.05 nm R1881 to be consistent with conditi"

An autocrine circuit was demonstrated when ovarian cancer cells, but not normal ovarian surface epithelial cells, were proven to express LPA(2) (Edg-4) and LPA(3) (Edg-7) G protein-coupled receptors for LPA. Human LPA(2) now has been expressed transgenically in C57BL/6 mouse ovaries under direction of the alpha-inhibin large promoter. Human LPA(2) mRNA and protein were detected in all transgenic (TG) mouse ovaries at levels far higher than in other tissues and at least fivefold higher than in cultured lines of human ovarian cancer cells, with the expected sex cord-stromal distribution. Most LPA(2) TG ovaries produced significantly higher levels than non-TG ovaries of type A, but not type B, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), isomers of VEGF-A, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). Many LPA(2) TG ovaries had elevated expression of VEGF receptors 1 and 2, and a depressed level of type 2 PA inhibitor. Thus, the LPA-LPA(2) circuit regulates ovarian cells both directly and through increases in protein growth factor systems."

During adult life, NRGs are highly expressed in neurons and they act on the juxtaposed tissues contributing to the maintenance of differentiated patterns, such as the neuromuscular junction, NMJ (8Altiok N.

Neurosci. 1998; 12: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). They are expressed as either membrane or soluble forms, mainly as a consequence of differential splicing of the primary transcript (reviewed in 13Lemke G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 247-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar and 14Fischbach G.D. Rosen K.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 429-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Soluble forms attach to the basal lamina through proteoglycans (e.g. agrin) and, by regulated proteolysis, they are released and bind to their receptors. NRGs bind to type I tyrosine kinase receptors that belong to the family of EGF receptors, ErbB3 and ErbB4. Binding generates homo- and heterodimerization between them and with ErbB2, which lacks a binding domain, whereas ErbB3 does not have kinase activity (reviewed in Ref. 15Citri A. Skaria K.B. Yarden Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Cultured myotubes express ErbB2 and ErbB3, but not ErbB4 (10Zhu X. Lai C. Thomas S. Burden S.J.

Biol. 1995; 172: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), so the main NRG receptor is the heterodimer ErbB2/ErbB3. All three receptors are expressed in muscle tissue although only ErbB2 and ErbB4 accumulate at the postsynaptic site (16Trinidad J.C. Fischbach G.D. Cohen J.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8762-8770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NRG binding and receptors dimerization induce tyrosine phosphorylation of receptors which activates several signaling cascades such as the PI3K-PKB, the mitogenic MAPKs and the stress-inducible p38MAPK pathways (17Yarden Y.

Zorzano A. Gumà A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18257-18264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This effect is fast and requires translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane (31Suárez E. Bach D. Cadefau J. Palacín M. Zorzano A. Gumà A. J. Biol.

Both exercise and oxidative stress induce glucose uptake through translocation of glucose transporters, in an additive and independent manner to the action of insulin, and AMPK has been suggested to be involved in this effect (41Hayashi T.

Here we examine the signaling cascade triggering the action of HRG on glucose uptake in L6E9 myotubes. PI3Ks, PDK1, and PKCζ, but not PKB, are involved in HRG-stimulated glucose uptake.

Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4567-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of HRG or insulin, culture medium was depleted of serum and replaced by 0.2% bovine serum albumin, which was added for 4.5 h. 2-Deoxy-d-[3H]Glucose Uptake—L6E9 cells were cultured on 6-well plates. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake assays were performed as previously described (31Suárez E.

Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Protein was measured by BCA protein reagent assay (Pierce). Each condition was run in duplicate or triplicate. 2-Deoxyglucose transport was linear during the period (10 min) assayed (not shown). 2-Deoxyglucose uptake assays were performed in strips of rat soleus muscles as previously described (31Suárez E.

Preparation of Extracts from L6E9 Myotubes and from Strips of Rat Soleus Muscle—Homogenates were prepared from L6E9 myotubes. They were placed on ice and washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before adding 300 μl (6-well plates) or 1 ml (100-mm dishes) of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, containing freshly added protease inhibitors: 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin and 1 μm pepstatin). Cells were then scraped, collected into an Eppendorf tube, and then homogenized by repetitive passes through a 25-gauge needle before being centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Finally, supernatant was collected and it was stored at –80 °C. Protein was measured by the Bradford method. Preparations of fractions enriched in plasma membranes (PM) or in intracellular membranes (LDM) were obtained from two 10-mm culture dishes as reported (31Suárez E. Bach D. Cadefau J. Palacín M. Zorzano A. Gumà A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18257-18264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Muscle homogenates were obtained from strips of rat soleus. Muscles were frozen, collected into an Eppendorf, placed on ice containing 200 μl of fresh lysis buffer, and then homogenized with an Eppendorf homogenizer. Homogenates were taken to a final volume of 1 ml/strip by adding lysis buffer and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was discarded, and supernatant was collected and stored at –80 °C until used. Protein was measured by the Bradford method. Immunoprecipitation Assays—Immunoprecipitation was performed by conjugating 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads with 2–5 μg of the corresponding antibody, except when it is indicated, shaking for 1 h at 4 °C, then washing twice in lysis buffer and incubating with 500–1,000 μg of lysate overnight with constant shaking at 4 °C. After brief centrifugation the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed several times with the lysis buffer and boiled with 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (LBS) for Western blot assays as described below. PVDF membranes were blotted with the corresponding antibodies. For PKC-ζ immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of homogenate were incubated overnight with 1 μg of an anti-nPKC-ζ antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), with constant shaking at 4 °C, and 30 μg of protein G-Sepharose beads were then added. Beads were then washed twice in lysis buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min in 50 μl LSB, and the supernatant was used for Western blot as described below. PVDF membranes were blotted with anti-phospho-PKCζ/λ (Thr410/403) antibody. PI3K Activity Assay—L6E9 myotubes were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm pepstatin A, 1 ng/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate. 100 μg of lysate protein was incubated with 1.5 μl of mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 90 min at 4 °C, and then immunoprecipitated with 2.5 mg of rehydrated protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 60 min. The immunoprecipitates were used for the kinase assay, which was performed with phosphatidylinositol as substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (44Baynes K.C. Beeton C.A. Panayotou G. Stein R.

After washing twice in lysis buffer, 500 μg of total lysate in the case of p70S6K or 100 μg otherwise were added and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a shaking platform. It was then centrifuged briefly at 13,000 rpm. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, and twice with 1 ml of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EGTA). The standard assay, which is employed unless stated, otherwise contained (50 μl of total volume): washed protein G-Sepharose immunoprecipitated, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μm PKI (TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD, peptide inhibitor of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼300 cpm/pmol) and the corresponding substrate: 30 μm Crosstide peptide (GRPRTSSFAEG) in all cases except for measuring MAP-KAP-K2 activity (30 μm MAPKAP-K2 substrate KKLNRTLSVA). The assays were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C, the assay tubes being agitated continuously to keep the immunoprecipitated in suspension. Incorporation of [γ-32P]phosphate into each peptide substrate was determined using p81 phosphocellulose paper. Papers were washed in 0.5% orthophosphoric acid, dried, and Cherenkov radiation was counted. 1 milliunit of activity is the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of 1 pmol of substrate in 1 min. AMPK Activity Assay—AMPK α1 and α2 activities were measured in L6E9 myotubes lysates as described previously (48Fryer L.G. Hajduch E. Rencurel F. Salt I.P. Hundal H.S. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1978-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) containing 5 mm glucose for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing the cells in phosphate-buffered saline, they were lysed into a minimal volume of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100), cell debris was spun down in a bench top centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was taken for assay. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent. 100–200 μg of protein was then sequentially immunoprecipitated using sheep antibodies raised against either α1 or α2 (49Woods A. Salt I. Scott J. Hardie D.G. Carling D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) conjugated to protein G-Sepharose beads. AMPK activity within the immune complex was measured by the phosphorylation of synthetic SAMS peptide using radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP. Immunoblotting—Protein samples containing LSB were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to PVDF membranes as previously described (31Suárez E.

The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline solution (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight with the corresponding primary antibodies at recommended dilutions in 1% bovine serum albumin. PVDF membranes were then washed, incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies, containing horseradish peroxidase, for 1 h at room temperature and washed again. Proteins were detected by the ECL method and quantified by scanning densitometry. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means + S.E. Unpaired Student's t test was used to compare two groups and one-way analysis of variance, posthoc Duncan's t test, was used to compare more than two groups. Neuregulins-induced Glucose Transport Requires an Intact ErbB3 Binding Activity—In order to prove the necessity of the ErbB3 binding activity in the NRG action on glucose uptake in L6E9 myotubes, we used an antibody, Ab5, that binds to ErbB3 and blocks the NRG-binding domain. When Ab5 (10 μg/ml) was added to the medium 30 min before HRG, it abolished the stimulation of glucose transport (Fig. 1A). Ab5 did not alter the insulin effect on glucose uptake (Fig. 1A). HRG enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3 receptors but it did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the β subunit of insulin receptors (Fig. 1B). Moreover, chronic insulin treatment that generated insulin resistance characterized by a deficient induction of glucose uptake, did not alter HRG action (Fig. 1, C and D). In all, HRG required ErbB3 to stimulate glucose uptake in L6E9 myotubes and this effect did not involve activation of the insulin receptor and it was not modified by induction of insulin resistance. Neuregulins Activate PI3K, PKB, and PKCζ in L6E9 Myotubes—Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated (PY99) and assayed for PI3K activity (Fig. 2A). HRG (3 nm) induced PI3K activity in L6E9 myotubes, and maximal effects were observed between 5 and 10 min. Increase in phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate involves activation of PDK1, which in turn phosphorylates and activates PKB, Thr308 (50Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B.

PKBα showed maximal activity at 10–15 min, whereas PKBγ showed maximal activity at 30 min, which was maintained for 90 min. HRG did not stimulate PKBβ activity in this cell line (data not shown). HRG (3 nm) activated PKCζ in L6E9 myotubes, with a maximum at 30 min (Fig. 2C). HRG and insulin did not show additive effects (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2049930674,"Human thyroid papillary carcinomas are characterized by rearrangements of the RET protooncogene with a number of heterologous genes, which generate the RET/papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) oncogenes. One of the most frequent variants of these recombination events is the fusion of the intracellular kinase-encoding domain of RET to the first 101 amino acids of a gene named H4(D10S170). We have characterized the H4(D10S170) gene product, showing that it is a ubiquitously expressed 55 KDa nuclear and cytosolic protein that is phosphorylated following serum stimulation. This phosphorylation was found to depend on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Erk1/2 activity and to be associated to the relocation of H4(D10S170) from the nucleus to the cytosol. Overexpression of the H4(D10S170) gene was able to induce apoptosis of thyroid follicular epithelial cells; conversely a carboxy-terminal truncated H4(D10S170) mutant H4(1-101), corresponding to the portion included in the RET/PTC1 oncoprotein, behaved as dominant negative on the proapoptotic function and nuclear localization of H4(D10S170). Furthermore, conditional expression of the H4(D10S170)-dominant negative truncated mutant protected cells from stress-induced apoptosis. The substitution of serine 244 with alanine abrogated the apoptotic function of H4(D10S170). These data suggest that loss of the H4(D10S170) gene function might have a role in thyroid carcinogenesis by impairing apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1985196783,"It has been well known that Ras signaling is involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, distinct cellular functions of Ras isozymes are not fully understood. Here we show the opposing roles of Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras genes in the modulation of cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Overexpression of active isoform of Ha-Ras (12V-Ha-Ras) in Rat2 cells increases resistance to the ionizing radiation. Constitutive activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt is detected specifically in 12V-Ha-Ras-overexpressing cells. The specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling and potentiates the radiation-induced apoptosis, suggesting that activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the increased radio-resistance in cells overexpressing 12V-Ha-Ras. Overexpression of activated Ki-Ras (12V-Ki-Ras), on the other hand, markedly increases radiation sensitivity. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity is selectively enhanced by ionizing radiation in cells overexpressing 12V-Ki-Ras. The specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, PD169316, or dominant-negative p38 MAPK decreases radiation-induced cell death. We further show that the mechanism that underlies potentiation of cell death in cells overexpressing 12V-Ki-Ras involves Bax translocation to the mitochondrial membrane. Elevated Bax translocation following ionizing irradiation in 12V-Ki-Ras-overexpressing cells is completely inhibited by PD169316 or dominant-negative p38 MAPK. In addition, introduction of cells with RacN17, a dominant-negative mutant of Rac, resulted in a marked inhibition of radiation-induced Bax translocation and apoptotic cell death as well as p38 MAPK activation. Taken together, these findings explain the opposite effects of Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras on modulation of radiosensitivity, and suggest that differential activation of PI3K/Akt and Rac/p38 MAPK signaling by Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras may account for the opposing response to the ionizing radiation. These data provide an explanation for the diverse biological functions of Ras isozymes, and partly accounts for the differential response of transformed cells to anticancer treatments."
https://openalex.org/W1973490763,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a childhood cancer that arises in the adrenal gland and often shows differentiated neuronal and glial elements. The RET receptor signal pathway is functional in most NB, while loss of nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor (trkA) gene expression correlates with an aggressive phenotype. Thus, we hypothesized that the RET and TRKA signal pathways collaborate to instruct NB differentiation, reminiscent of normal neuronal maturation. Here, we demonstrate that activation of the RET receptor by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) increases expression of the RET receptor complex in a panel of malignant human NB cell lines, indicative of a positive feedback mechanism. GDNF also induces growth cessation concomitant with an arrest of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, GDNF synergizes with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) to enhance TRKA receptor expression, thereby strengthening the NGF-mediated differentiation signal. Differentiated NB cells downregulate expression of the amplified N-myc gene, concurrent with the arrest of cell proliferation, while expressing neuron-specific markers (i.e., SCG10). Interestingly, maintenance of differentiated NB cells in culture is independent of the trophic activity of GDNF, but depends on TRKA signaling, thereby re-enacting the differentiation of normal sympathoadrenal (SA) progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2030408404,"Progression of human colon cancer is often associated with elevated expression and activity of the Src family tyrosine kinase (SFK). SFK is ordinarily in equilibrium between inactive and primed states by a balance of negative regulatory kinase Csk and its counteracting tyrosine phosphatase(s), both of which act on the regulatory C-terminal tyrosine of SFK. To evaluate the contribution of the regulatory system of SFK in cancer progression, we here modulated the equilibrium status of SFK by introducing wild-type or dominant-negative Csk in human epithelial colon cancer cells, HCT15 and HT29. Overexpression of wild-type Csk induced decreased SFK activation, increased cell-cell contacts mediated by E-cadherin, decreased the number of focal contacts and decreased cell adhesion/migration and in vitro invasiveness. Conversely, expression of a dominant-negative Csk resulted in elevated SFK activation, enhanced phosphorylation of FAK and paxilllin, enhanced cell scattering, an increased number of focal contacts, dramatic rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton and increased cell adhesion/migration and in vitro invasiveness. In these scattered cells, however, localization, expression and phosphorylation of either E-cadherin or beta-catenin were not significantly affected, suggesting that the E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contact is indirectly regulated by SFK. Furthermore, all these events occurred absolutely dependent on integrin-mediated cell adhesion. These findings demonstrate that Csk defines the ability of integrin-SFK-mediated cell adhesion signaling that influences the metastatic potential of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2089473921,"Recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV) vectors transduction efficiency varies greatly in different cell types. We have described that a cellular protein, FKBP52, in its phosphorylated form interacts with the D-sequence in the viral inverted terminal repeat, inhibits viral second strand DNA synthesis, and limits transgene expression. Here we investigated the role of cellular heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) in AAV transduction because FKBP52 forms a complex with HSP90, and because heat-shock treatment augments AAV transduction efficiency. Heat-shock treatment of HeLa cells resulted in tyrosine dephosphorylation of FKBP52, led to stabilization of the FKBP52-HSP90 complex, and resulted in ∼6-fold increase in AAV transduction. However, when HeLa cells were pre-treated with tyrphostin 23, a specific inhibitor of cellular epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates FKBP52 at tyrosine residues, heat-shock treatment resulted in a further 18-fold increase in AAV transduction. HSP90 was shown to be a part of the FKBP52-AAV D-sequence complex, but HSP90 by itself did not bind to the D-sequence. Geldanamycin treatment, which disrupts the HSP90-FKBP52 complex, resulted in >22-fold increase in AAV transduction in heat-shock-treated cells compared with heat shock alone. Deliberate overexpression of the human HSP90 gene resulted in a significant decrease in AAV-mediated transduction in tyrphostin 23-treated cells, whereas down-modulation of HSP90 levels led to a decrease in HSP90-FKBP52-AAV D-sequence complex formation, resulting in a significant increase in AAV transduction following pre-treatment with tyrphostin 23. These studies suggest that the observed increase in AAV transduction efficiency following heat-shock treatment is unlikely to be mediated by HSP90 alone and that increased levels of HSP90, in the absence of heat shock, facilitate binding of FKBP52 to the AAV D-sequence, thereby leading to inhibition of AAV-mediated transgene expression.

Although AAV transduction efficiency can be increased following heat-shock treatment (38Ferrari F.K. Samulski T. Shenk T. Samulski R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Yakinoglu A.O. Heilbronn R. Burkle A. Schlehofer J.R. zur Hausen H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3123-3129PubMed Google Scholar), it remains unclear what role, if any, HSP90 plays in modulating FKBP52 interaction with the AAV D-sequence, and whether FKBP52-HSP90 complex is involved in modulating AAV-mediated transgene expression.In this report, we present evidence that HSP90 is a part of the FKBP52-AAV D-sequence complex, but HSP90 itself does not bind to the D-sequence directly, although it can be phosphorylated at both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues in vitro. We also demonstrate that the poor binding of unphosphorylated FKBP52 to the D-sequence can be significantly enhanced in the presence of unphosphorylated HSP90. Furthermore, heat-shock treatment of HeLa cells, which leads to overexpression of HSP90, also leads to tyrosine dephosphorylation of FKBP52, which in turn results in an increase in AAV transduction efficiency. Treatment with geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of HSP90 which dissociates HSP90 from FKBP52, also increases AAV transduction efficiency in heat-shock-treated cells. These data led to the hypothesis that increased levels of HSP90 in heat-shock-treated cells facilitate the dissociation of FKBP52 from AAV D-sequence and thereby lead to a more efficient viral second strand DNA synthesis and, consequently, efficient transgene expression. This hypothesis was tested by deliberate overexpression of the human HSP90 gene in HeLa cells. However, this led to a significant decrease in AAV transduction efficiency. In contrast, stable transfection of the HSP90 gene in the antisense orientation reduced the levels of HSP90 in these cells, which led to a decrease in the HSP90-FKBP52-AAV D-sequence complex formation, and resulted in a significant increase in AAV-mediated transgene expression. These studies corroborate the notion that although HSP90 is a part of the complex between FKBP52 and the AAV D-sequence, the observed increase in AAV transduction efficiency following heat-shock treatment is unlikely to be mediated by increased levels of HSP90 alone. Our data also suggest that increased levels of HSP90, in the absence of heat-shock, facilitate binding of FKBP52 to the AAV D-sequence, and thus lead to inhibition of AAV-mediated transgene expression. Conversely, down-modulation of HSP90 levels decrease the extent of the complex formation between serine/threonine-phosphorylated forms of FKBP52 and the AAV D-sequence, resulting in augmentation in AAV-mediated transgene expression. We propose a model that helps explain the available data on the interaction between FKBP52 and HSP90 and its role in AAV-mediated transgene expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Virus, Plasmids, Antibodies, and Chemicals—The human cervical carcinoma cell line, HeLa, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained as monolayer cultures in Iscove's-modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 1% (by volume) 100× stock solution of antibiotics (10,000 units of penicillin + 10,000 μg of streptomycin). Highly purified stocks of a recombinant AAV vector containing the β-galactosidase (lacZ) reporter gene driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter (vCMVp-lacZ) were generated as described previously (14Nathwani A.C.

The plasmid pH6HSP90 was generously provided by Dr. Takayuki K. Nemoto (Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan). Antibodies specific for human FKBP52, HSP90 (goat polyclonal IgG), and normal goat IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies specific for FKBP52 and HSP90 (mouse monoclonal IgG1) were obtained from Calbiochem. All chemicals used were purchased from Calbiochem or Sigma.Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts (WCE)—WCE from HeLa cells were prepared according to the method of Muller (58Muller M.T. J.

https://openalex.org/W2087468454,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted glycoprotein produced by osteoclasts, macrophages, T cells, hematopoietic cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells. It contributes to macrophage homing and cellular immunity. It also mediates neovascularization, inhibits apoptosis, and plays important roles in extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis. These properties are also characteristics of metastatic cancer cells. Consequently, the OPN gene was found to be upregulated among various metastatic cancer cells. This suggests that OPN is involved in tumor metastasis. How the OPN gene is upregulated in metastatic cancer cells remains to be illustrated. Thus, we investigated the transcriptional activation of the OPN promoter in the human metastatic cancer cell line A2058. We cloned the OPN promoter, and serial deletion analysis of the OPN promoter showed that the region between –170 and –127 may act as an enhancer to control the OPN gene in metastatic tumor cells. This region was found to contain overlapped AML-1 and C/EBP binding site motifs. Gel-mobility-shift assays using the A2058 nuclear extract and AML-1a or C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha) recombinant protein indicated that these two transcription factors can bind to the overlapped AML-1 /C/EBP binding site motifs on the OPN regulatory sequence from –147 to –127. Surprisingly, the gel-shift experiments did not show supershift complex formation between AML-1 and C/EBPα. Functional analysis showed that the C/EBPα was more potent than the complex of AML-1 and its cofactor CBFβ to upregulate the OPN promoter. In addition, AML-1 and C/EBPα did not exhibit transactivation additively or synergistically. Our results suggest that AML-1 and C/EBPα play an important role in the upregulation of the OPN gene in metastatic tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W1989021619,"Several reports have suggested that a defect in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system not only causes resistance to methylating agents but also confers low-level resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. Here we report that in a clonogenic assay, mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells deficient for the MMR protein MSH2 respond similarly as wild-type cells to cisplatin. Furthermore, restoring MSH2 expression in a cisplatin-resistant subclone selected from an Msh2(-/-) cell population did not sensitize cells to cisplatin. To ascertain that our observations were not the result of a mutation in the Msh2(-/-) cells that obscured the contribution of a defective MMR machinery to cisplatin resistance, we made use of the Cre-lox system to create a cell line in which the Msh2 gene can be conditionally inactivated. However, while de novo inactivation of Msh2 rendered cells tolerant to the methylating drug N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine as expected, it did not alter the sensitivity to cisplatin. In addition, we were not able to derive cisplatin-resistant subclones from this freshly generated MMR-deficient cell line. Thus, in ES cells we did not find evidence for direct involvement of MMR deficiency in cisplatin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2072764182,"We investigated how the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein affects the cell cycle profile and cell cycle-related molecules by using the HCV core-expressing stable transfectant. Analysis of the cell cycle profile showed that HCV core impaired G1 to S transition. The E2F-mediated transcription, phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK2 activities were suppressed in HCV core-expressing cells. The expression levels of G1 phase-related CDKs/cyclins and various CDK inhibitors were not substantially affected by expression of HCV core. When influences of HCV core on CDK-activating kinase (CAK) were examined, the expression levels of the CAK components, CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1, were not affected. However, formation of the ternary CAK complex, CAK activity, and the CDK2 level with activating phosphorylation were inhibited by expression of the HCV core. The direct effect of HCV core on CAK was further assessed in the cell-free system by adding the in vitro translated HCV core protein to the anti-CDK7 immunoprecipitate from the cell. The results showed that HCV core led to dissociation of MAT1 from the CAK complex and suppressed the CAK activity. Furthermore, the binding assay revealed that the HCV core was directed against CDK7. Their interaction occurred mainly in the nucleus by the immunostaining. In conclusion, the HCV core protein interacts with CAK and functions as an extrinsic suppressor of CAK. This may be the molecular basis of HCV core-mediated suppression of cell cycle progression. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism concerning HCV core-mediated alteration in the cell cycle machinery.

In addition, the HCV core has been demonstrated to modulate various cellular signal transduction pathways (6Yoshida T. Hanada T. Tokuhisa T. Kosai K. Sata M. Kohara M. Yoshimura A. J. Exp.

Such biological activities of the HCV core to the host cell are thought to be triggered by its direct interaction with cellular proteins. More than 10 HCV core-binding proteins have so far been identified (6Yoshida T. Hanada T. Tokuhisa T. Kosai K. Sata M. Kohara M. Yoshimura A. J. Exp.

The eukaryotic cell cycle progression is tightly regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins (reviewed in Refs. 24Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar, 25Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 26Morgan D.O.

Various CDK-cyclin complexes work in different phases during cell cycle progression; CDK4/6-cyclin D (cycD) plays a major role in the mid-G1 phase, CDK2-cycE plays a role in the late G1 phase, CDK2-cycA plays a role in the S phase, and CDC2 (also termed as CDK1)-cycB plays a role in the G2/M phase. In particular, the retinoblastoma protein pRB is important as a substrate of the CDK-cyclin complexes in the G1 phase. Once, the complexes of CDK4/6-cycD and CDK2-cycE phosphorylate pRB, the transcription factor E2F is activated. Then the E2F enhances transcription of many genes to enter the S phase. The functions of CDK-cyclin complexes are negatively regulated by CDK inhibitors, which are divided into two groups, a CIP/KIP family (p21CIP1, p27KIP1, and p57KIP2) and an INK4 family (p16INK4A, p15INK4B, p18INK4C, and p19INK4D). p21CIP1 is an especially well known transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53 (29el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). The CDK activity is also controlled by both inhibitory and activating phosphorylations (25Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 26Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal inhibitory phosphorylation sites (Thr-14 and Tyr-15 in human CDK2) are dephosphorylated by CDC25 phosphatases. On the other hand, phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the T-loop (Thr-160 in human CDK2) is required for full activation of CDKs. The CDK-activating kinase (CAK) undergoes the activating phosphorylation of CDKs. CAK is composed of three components, a catalytic subunit CDK7, a regulatory subunit cycH, and an assembly factor MAT1 (30Fesquet D. Labbe J.C. Derancourt J. Capony J.P. Galas S. Girard F. Lorca T.

It has been shown that CAK can phosphorylate all cell cycle-related CDKs, CDC2, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, and CDK6, at least in the cell-free system (30Fesquet D. Labbe J.C. Derancourt J. Capony J.P.

Thus far, the effects of HCV core on the cell cycle profile and cell cycle-related molecules have been studied by a few investigators (21Wang F. Yoshida I. Takamatsu M. Ishido S. Fujita T. Oka K. Hotta H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Otsuka M. Kato N. Lan K. Yoshida H. Kato J. Goto T. Shiratori Y. Omata M. J. Biol.

Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the HCV core can bind to both p53 and p21CIP1 and that its binding to p53 up-regulates the p53-dependent transcription activity of p21CIP1 in cultured cells transiently transfected with HCV core-expressing plasmid (21Wang F. Yoshida I. Takamatsu M. Ishido S. Fujita T. Oka K. Hotta H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Otsuka M. Kato N. Lan K. Yoshida H. Kato J. Goto T. Shiratori Y. Omata M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34122-34130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The stable transfectant with HCV core-expressing plasmid derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells has also been shown to impair the cell cycle regulation accompanied by enhancement of p21CIP1 expression (35Honda M. Kaneko S. Shimazaki T. Matsushita E. Kobayashi K. Ping L.H. Zhang H.C. Lemon S.M. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, molecular mechanisms concerning HCV core-mediated modulation on the cell cycle-related molecules other than the p53/p21CIP1 system have not been elucidated. To solve this, we investigated the effects on cell cycle-related molecules caused by persistent expression of the HCV core in cultured murine normal liver cells. In this process, we found that CAK is a novel target of the HCV core and that the HCV core suppresses cell cycle progression by a direct inhibitory effect on CAK assembly and activity. Plasmid Constructs—The HCV core-expressing plasmid pc/3EFΔNCTH, which was constructed from a mammalian expression vector pc/3EFpro, carried the whole HCV core gene and the 5′-part of the envelope 1 gene of a genotype 1b HCV strain (36Tokushige K. Moradpour D. Wakita T. Geissler M. Hayashi N. Wands J.R. J. Virol. Methods. 1997; 64: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both pc/3EFpro and pc/3EFΔNCTH were kindly provided by Dr. T. Wakita (Department of Microbiology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science). pF/core(1–191) was synthesized from pCMVtag2B (Stratagene) by inserting the HCV core gene (amino acids (aa) 1–191) downstream of the T3 promoter and used for the in vitro translation. pTALluc (Clontech) encoded the luciferase gene driven by the minimal TAL promoter. pE2Fluc (Clontech) was a derivative of pTALluc and possessed a repeated sequence of the E2F-responsive element upstream of the TAL promoter. pCMVβ (Clontech) expressed the β-galactosidase gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Plasmids p5GEX/hCDK2, p5GEX/hCDK7, p5GEX/hcycH, and p5GEX/hpRB(379–793) were used for the production of human CDK2, CDK7, cycH, and pRB as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. To construct these plasmids, whole coding regions of the cDNAs for CDK2, CDK7, and cycH and the part of the pRB cDNA (corresponding to aa 379–793 of pRB) were obtained by PCR using a cDNA sample from human hepatoma-derived cell lines, Huh-7 (37Nakabayashi H. Takeda K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar) (for CDK2) and HepG2 (38Aden D.P. Fogel A. Plotkin S. Damjanov I. Knowles B.B. Nature. 1979; 282: 615-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) (for pRB), or using the human adult liver cDNA library (Clontech) (for CDK7 and cycH). The cDNA fragments were cloned into the multicloning site of the plasmid p5GEX-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Plasmid p5GEX/core(1–122) expressed the fusion protein of GST with the truncated HCV core protein (aa 1–122). Plasmid pGCTD produced the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II fused to GST (39Peterson S.R. Dvir A. Anderson C.W. Dynan W.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 426-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which was a kind gift from Dr. William S. Dynan (Institute of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Medical College of Georgia). Cell Culture and Protein Extraction—A murine normal liver cell line, BNL CL.2 (CL2) (40Patek P. Collins J. Cohn M. Nature. 1978; 276: 510-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2 (38Aden D.P. Fogel A. Plotkin S. Damjanov I. Knowles B.B. Nature. 1979; 282: 615-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml of penicillin G sodium, and 0.25 μg/ml of amphotericin B at 37 °C in a 5% CO2. Three independent clones of the HCV core-expressing cells (designated as CL2 core-I, -II, and -III) and the negative control cells (mock) were established from the CL2 cells as described elsewhere (15Hosui A. Ohkawa K. Ishida H. Sato A. Nakanishi F. Ueda K. Takehara T. Kasahara A. Sasaki Y. Hori M. Hayashi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28562-28571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 41Ohkawa K. Ishida H. Nakanishi F. Hosui A. Sato A. Ueda K. Takehara T. Kasahara A. Sasaki Y. Hori M. Hayashi N. Hepatol. Res. 2003; 25: 396-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The total cellular protein was extracted with the lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and used for Western blotting, immunoprecipitation (IP), kinase assay, and in vitro binding assay. The nuclear fraction was obtained from the cells by the method described elsewhere (42Ishida H. Ueda K. Ohkawa K. Kanazawa Y. Hosui A. Nakanishi F. Mita E. Kasahara A. Sasaki Y. Hori M. Hayashi N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Analyses of Cell Growth—To examine the cell growth curve, 5 × 103 of CL2 mock and core cells were seeded on a 96-well culture plate. After 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, the net number of viable cells were assessed colorimetrically using the water-soluble tetrazolium (2-[2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl]-3-[4-nitrophenyl]-5-[2,4-disulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium monosodium salt) (Roche Applied Science) (43Wagner S. Beil W. Westermann J. Logan R.P.H. Bock C.T. Trautwein C. Bleck J.S. Manns M.P. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1836-1847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt by mitochondrial dehydrogenase in viable cells. For the assay, 10 μl of the water-soluble tetrazolium reagent was added to the 100-μl culture medium, followed by the incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Then the optical density at 450 nm was measured. The assay was done in quadruplicate, and the values were expressed as the means ± S.D. Analysis of Cell Cycle Profile—The flow cytometric analysis to examine the cell cycle profile was done by the method described previously (44Zhuang S.H. Burnstein K.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1197-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the CL2 mock and core cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stored at -20 °C. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in the phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml of propidium iodine and 1 mg/ml RNase A to stain the cellular double-stranded nucleic acid. After filtration with a 60-μm mesh filter, the cell suspension was analyzed on a FACScaliber flow cytometer and with Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson). Percentages of cells representing G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases were determined. Reporter Gene Assay—For cotransfection analysis, 8.0 × 104 of CL2 cells were seeded in a 35-mm-diameter culture dish and cotransfected of 0.5 μg of the reporter plasmid (pE2Fluc or pTALluc) with 0.5 μg of the effector plasmid (pc/3EFpro or p/3EFΔNCTH) using 6 μg of the cationic liposome (Lipofectin; Invitrogen). For the assay using cells constitutively expressing the HCV core, 8.0 × 104 of CL2 mock or 1.2 × 105 of CL2 core cells were seeded and transfected with 1 μg of the reporter plasmid (pE2Fluc and pTALluc). In all of the reporter gene assays, 0.1 μg of pCMVβ was also transfected. Two days after transfection, the cells were lysed and subjected to the luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. The luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency based on the result of β-galactosidase assay. To determine the E2F-mediated transcription activity, the ratio of the fold activity in transfection with the pE2Fluc to that in transfection with pTALluc was calculated. All of the assays were done in quadruplicate, and the values were expressed as the means ± S.D. Northern Blot Analysis—For Northern blot analysis, total cellular RNA was extracted from CL2 mock and core cells using a TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) based on the guanidine-isothiocyanate method. The poly(A)+ RNA was selected from 50 μg of the total cellular RNA with an oligo(dT) column (Roche Applied Science). The sample was electrophoresed, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N; Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized to the cDNA probe. After washing, the membrane was autoradiographed. The membrane was dehybridized by boiling in 0.5% SDS and further used for the hybridization to detect β-actin mRNA as a loading control (data not shown). Antibodies—An antibody to pRB was obtained from Pharmingen. Antibodies to CDK4, CDK6, cycD1, CDK2, cycE, cycA, CDC2, cycB1, p53, p21CIP1, p27KIP1, CDK7, cycH, and MAT1 were purchased from Santa Cruz. An antibody to phosphorylated CDK2 at the Thr-160 residue (pT160-CDK2) came from Cell Signaling. An antibody to GST was from Amersham Biosciences. A mouse monoclonal antibody to HCV core (45Yasui K. Wakita T. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Funahashi S.I. Ichikawa M. Kajita T. Moradpour D. Wands J.R. Kohara M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6048-6055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. T. Wakita (Department of Microbiology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science). Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy—The CL2 core-I cells were plated on a two-well chamber slide. One day after seeding, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 3 min. After the blocking reaction with 10% fetal calf serum for 30 min at room temperature, the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 14 h with two primary antibodies, a mouse monoclonal HCV core antibody, and a rabbit polyclonal CDK7 antibody. Bound primary antibodies were revealed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch). Finally, a coverslip was mounted in the mounting medium (Vectashield; Vector Laboratories) with 4′,6-diamidino-2′-phenylindole-dihydrochrolide, and the cells were examined by the confocal microscopic analysis using a Radiance 2100 BLD system (Bio-Rad). Colocalization of green and red signals in a single pixel produces yellow, whereas separated signals remain green or red. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—For Western blot analysis, the total cellular protein was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a membrane. After blocking with milk, the membrane was incubated with the specific antibody, followed by further incubation with a secondary antibody. Finally, the immune complex was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescent assay (Super Signal; Pierce). As for the IP reaction, 250–500 μg of the total cellular protein was precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with the specific antibody at 4 °C for 1–2 h. Then the beads was added, and the sample was further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After the extensive washing, the product was used for Western blot analysis and the kinase assay. In some experiments, the binding reaction of the IP product with the in vitro translation product was carried out at 4 °C for 3 h, prior to the subsequent experiments. The in vitro translation was conducted using the TnT T3 coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Synthesis for GST Fusion Proteins and Binding Assay—To construct various GST fusion proteins, the Escherichia coli BL21 (Stratagene) was transformed with p5GEX/hCDK2, p5GEX/hCDK7, p5GEX/hcycH, p5GEX/hpRB(379–793), p5GEX/core(1–122), pGCTD, and the empty plasmid p5GEX-1. The bacteria were grown in the medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin sodium, and the proteins were expressed by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After sonication of the bacterial pellet, the proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). For the binding assay, ∼5 μg of the various GST fusion protein or GST protein (negative control) was bound to the beads and incubated with 150 μg of the cellular lysate or 10 μl of in vitro translated protein at 4 °C for 2 h. After the extensive washing, the bound protein was used for Western blotting. Kinase Assay—For the kinase assay, 250–500 μg of the total cellular protein was immunoprecipitated with CDK4, CDK2, and CDK7 antibodies as above. After extensive washing, the precipitate was subjected to the kinase assay in the presence of 12.5 mm MOPS, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, and 10 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a total volume of 30 μl. Also added as a substrate was 2 μg of the GST-pRB fusion protein for the CDK4 kinase assay, the histone H1 (Calbiochem) for the CDK2 kinase assay, the GST-CDK2 fusion protein for the CAK assay, or the GST-CTD fusion protein for the CTD kinase assay. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. After the elution, the supernatant was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried and autoradiographed. As for the CAK assay, the kinase reaction was carried out without [γ-32P]ATP, and the phosphorylated product was detected by Western blotting using a pT160-CDK2 antibody. All kinase assays were carried out with scaling up by 1.3–1.5-fold. Before the kinase reaction, the sample was divided into two tubes, and the remaining product was immunoblotted with the same antibody as that used for the IP reaction as a loading control (data not shown). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Student's nonpaired t test as appropriate. p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. HCV Core Protein Impairs G1/S Transition in the Cell Cycle through Suppression of CDK4 and CDK2 Activities—Fig. 1A shows the cellular growth curve of CL2 mock and core cells. Cell growth was significantly suppressed in the CL2 core cells, compared with the mock cells. Their cell cycle profiles were then assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1B). In the mock cells, ∼30% of the cells were in the G0/G1 fraction, whereas in the CL2 core cells, more than 60% of cells were in this phase. The cells representing S and G2/M phases were decreased by expression of the HCV core. The effect of the HCV core on the E2F-mediated transcription activity was next studied (Fig. 2A). In the cotransfection experiment using the CL2 cells, cotransfection of the HCV core-expressing plasmid pc/3EFΔNCTH significantly reduced the E2F-mediated transcription activity, compared with that of the negative control plasmid, pc/3EFpro. Significant reduction in E2F-mediated transcription by HCV core was also seen in the experiment using the CL2 mock and core cells. When the phosphorylation status of pRB was compared between CL2 mock and core cells (Fig. 2B), expression of HCV core caused a decrease of the hyperphosphorylated pRB and an increase of the hypo-phosphorylated pRB. As for CDK4 and CDK2 kinase activities (Fig. 2C), both kinase activities were substantially lower in the CL2 core cells than in the mock cells. Thus, persistent expression of the HCV core impaired the G1/S transition in the cell cycle, whi"
https://openalex.org/W2074695569,"Transcriptional silencing of antitumor genes via CpG island methylation could be a mechanism mediating prostate cancer (PCa) progression from an androgen-sensitive (AS) to an androgen-insensitive (AI) state. We have used the methylation-sensitive restriction fingerprinting (MSRF) technique to identify novel CpG-rich sequences that are differentially methylated between the genome of the AS PCa cell line LNCaP and that of an AI subline LNCaP(CS) generated by maintaining LNCaP in medium with charcoal-stripped (CS) serum for over 30 passages. One such sequence identified was located on a 5' CpG island that was found to span part of the promoter, exon 1, and part of intron 1 of the peroxisomal membrane protein 24 kDa (PMP24) gene. Using semiquantitative RT-PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing, we established an inverse relationship between mRNA expression and methylation of the 5' CpG island of PMP24. PMP24 mRNA was absent in LNCaP(CS) and the androgen receptor-negative PC-3 cell line; both exhibited dense methylation in the said CpG island. In contrast, PMP24 mRNA was expressed in LNCaP and normal prostatic epithelial cells (NPrECs) whose PMP24 5' CpG island remained unmethylated. Treatment of LNCaP(CS) and PC-3 with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZAdC) reactivated PMP24 mRNA expression. Transient transfection of PMP24 into LNCaP(CS) and PC-3 cells induced a significant reduction in cell growth and soft-agar colony formation potential, suggesting that PMP24 gene product has antitumor properties. These results demonstrate the utility of MSRF in the identification of novel, differentially methylated DNA sequences in the genome and suggest that hypermethylation-mediated silencing of PMP24 is an epigenetic event involved in PCa progression to androgen independence."
https://openalex.org/W2048265860,"A domain-specific disruption was performed on the destruction box sequence of endogenous Geminin gene, an inhibitor of the DNA replication initiation complex, in a human cancer cell line HCT116 resulting in the formation of a protein that was stable in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Although the total amount of Geminin in asynchronous cultures was not elevated, the G1-specific stabilization of Geminin, diminished chromatin loading of minichromosome maintenance complex, inhibited DNA replication, and resulted in the accumulation of cells in G1. The mutated Geminin suppressed in vivo tumorigenicity and in vitro cell growth. Cells carrying this mutation failed to support the replication of a plasmid bearing the oriP replicator of Epstein-Barr virus. The DNA damage checkpoint pathway was activated in the mutated cells with increased levels of p53 protein and its target, the p21 protein. All these deficits were rescued by overexpression of Cdt1, a replication initiator protein that binds to Geminin. Therefore, alteration of the cell cycle-dependent regulation of endogenous Geminin in human cells without increasing total protein level inhibits DNA replication and suppresses tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W1977088407,"Patients with myeloid malignancies and either the 3q21q26 syndrome or t(1;3)(p36;q21) have been reported to share similar clinicopathological features and a common molecular mechanism for leukemogenesis. Overexpression of MDS1/EVI1 (3q26) or MEL1/PRDM16 (1p36), both members of the PR-domain family, has been directly implicated in the malignant transformation of this subset of neoplasias. The breakpoints in both entities are outside the genes, and the 3q21 region, where RPN1 is located, seems to act as an enhancer. MEL1 has been reported to be expressed in leukemia cells with t(1;3) and in the normal uterus and fetal kidney, but neither in bone marrow (BM) nor in other tissues, suggesting that this gene is specific to t(1;3)-positive MDS/AML. We report the molecular characterization of a t(1;3)(p36;q21) in a patient with MDS (RAEB-2). In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrate that MEL1, the PR-containing form, and MEL1S, the PR-lacking form, are widely expressed in normal tissues, including BM. The clinicopathological features and the breakpoint on 1p36 are different from cases previously described, and MEL1 is not overexpressed, suggesting a heterogeneity in myeloid neoplasias with t(1;3)."
https://openalex.org/W2030674197,"Mdm4 (MdmX) is a p53-binding protein that shares structural similarities with Mdm2 and has been proposed to be a negative regulator of p53 function. Like Mdm2, the absence of Mdm4 has recently been found to induce embryonic lethality in mice that is rescued by p53 deletion. Mdm4-null embryos are reduced in size and die at mid-gestation, and Mdm4-deficient embryos and embryonic fibroblasts displayed reduced rates of cell proliferation. The p53-induced, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is strongly upregulated in Mdm4-null embryos and cells. Here, we report that deletion of p21 delays the mid-gestation lethality observed in Mdm4-null mice, suggesting that Mdm4 downregulates p53-mediated suppression of cell growth. Surprisingly, the absence of p21 also uncovers an antiproliferative effect of Mdm4 on cell growth in vitro and in Mdm4-heterozygous mice. These results indicate that p21 is a downstream modifier of Mdm4, and provides genetic evidence that Mdm4 can function to regulate cell growth both positively and negatively."
https://openalex.org/W2062379285,"Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) are present in variable number in most human cell types and have been linked to various cellular functions, including roles as depots for DNA repair proteins. Here, we show that treatment of human cells with DNA methylating agents leads to redistribution of PML from NBs to a diffuse nuclear localization. Biochemically, this correlates with a specific reduction of PML levels in the nuclear matrix fraction without affecting total PML levels. Similar results were obtained for the other major PML NB component, the Sp100 protein, indicating that DNA methylating agents lead to a general disassembly of PML NBs. Similar to the dispersal of PML NBs in response to some viral infections, PML redistribution after DNA damage was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. We propose that the regulated dispersal of PML NBs may facilitate the enhanced release of DNA repair proteins from NB depots in order to respond adequately to extensive DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2140096558,"We have investigated the molecular mechanisms regulating insulin internalization and intracellular sorting. Insulin internalization was decreased by 50% upon incubation of the cells with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. PI3K inhibition also reduced insulin degradation and intact insulin release by 50 and 75%, respectively. Insulin internalization was reduced by antisense inhibition of protein kinase C-ζ (PKCζ) expression and by overexpression of a dominant negative PKCζ mutant (DN-PKCζ). Conversely, overexpression of PKCζ increased insulin internalization as a function of the PKCζ levels achieved in the cells. Expression of wild-type protein kinase B (PKB)-α or of a constitutively active form (myr-PKB) did not significantly alter insulin internalization and degradation but produced a 100% increase of intact insulin release. Inhibition of PKB by a dominant negative mutant (DN-PKB) or by the pharmacological inhibitor ML-9 reduced intact insulin release by 75% with no effect on internalization and degradation. In addition, overexpression of Rab5 completely rescued the effect of PKCζ inhibition on insulin internalization but not that of PKB inhibition on intact insulin recycling. Indeed, PKCζ bound to and activated Rab5. Thus, PI3K controls different steps within the insulin endocytic itinerary.

Thereafter, insulin signaling impinges on at least three major enzymatic systems, the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinases, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB), and the protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction pathways. These systems contribute to insulin regulation of cell metabolism, differentiation, and growth (2Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In addition, hormone-bound IR is rapidly removed from the cell surface and internalized within clathrin-coated vesicles (3Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.L. Gorden P. Van Obberghen E. Blackett N.M. Grunfeld C. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7788-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms, downstream receptor kinase activation, which control the internalization and the subsequent intracellular itinerary, have not been elucidated. PI3K is necessary for the internalization of several growth factor receptors (17Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F.S. Corvera S.

PI3K and its downstream effectors have been implicated in the trafficking of endocytic and exocytic vesicles in yeast and mammalian cells (20Toker A. Cell. Mol.

Atypical PKC isoforms, such as PKCζ and PKCλ, which need phosphoinositides generated by the PI3K for their catalytic functions, may regulate vesicle trafficking by modulating cytoskeletal re-organization via Rho and Rac small GTPases (22Coghlan M.P.

In this paper, we have attempted to elucidate the role of major signaling systems in regulating the insulin endocytic itinerary. We show that PI3K inhibitors reduce insulin internalization and alter intracellular sorting. We also present evidence, for the first time, that the PI3K effect on internalization occurs via PKCζ activation, whereas PKB facilitates the release of intact insulin outside the cell. Finally, we show that Rab5 is involved in early events of insulin endocytosis, possibly downstream of PKCζ, but it does not interfere with insulin intracellular sorting. Materials—Media, sera, antibiotics for cell culture, the LipofectAMINE reagent, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies toward the specific PKC isoforms were from Invitrogen.

Transient transfection of the PKC isoforms plasmid constructs, the phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, and the PKB and Rab5 constructs was performed by the LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) method according to the manufacturer's instructions. For these studies, 50–80% confluent cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and incubated for 8 h with 5 μg of plasmid constructs or with 12 μg of oligonucleotides and 45–60 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent. The medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, and cells were further incubated for 15 h before being assayed. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation Procedure—Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 2 h at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min and assayed as described in Miele et al. (33Miele C. Caruso M. Calleja V. Auricchio R. Oriente F. Formisano P. Condorelli G. Cafieri A.

Briefly, solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to 0.45-μm Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Upon incubation with the primary and secondary antibodies, immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously (34Formisano P. Oriente F. Miele C. Caruso M. Auricchio R. Vigliotta G. Condorelli G. Beguinot F. J. Biol.

Protein Kinase C Activity—Individual PKC isoforms were immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies and assayed as described previously (34Formisano P. Oriente F. Miele C. Caruso M. Auricchio R.

Cells were solubilized in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin (extraction buffer), and then clarified by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants were further centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 2 h, and pellets were solubilized with extraction buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Proteins were then immunoprecipitated with isoform-specific antibodies and supplemented with lipid activators (10 mm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 0.28 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 4 mg/ml diolein, final concentrations). Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by addition of the substrate solution (20 μm ATP, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 10 μCi/ml (3,000 Ci/mmol) [γ-32P]ATP, final concentrations) and of specific substrates. An acetylated peptide comprising amino acids 4–14 of myelin basic protein was used as PKCα substrate, the H-Arg-Phe-Ala-Val-Arg-Asp-Met-Arg-Gln-Thr-Val-Ala-Val-Gly-Val-Ile-Lys-Ala-Val-Asp-Lys-Lys-OH peptide as PKCδ substrate, and the pseudosubstrate region of PKCϵ for PKCζ. The reaction mixtures were further incubated for 10 min at room temperature, rapidly cooled on ice, and spotted on phosphocellulose discs. Disk bound radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Insulin Internalization and Degradation—Insulin internalization was determined as described previously (15Formisano P. De Novellis G. Miele C. Tripodi F. Caruso M. Palumbo G. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16242-16246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold KRP solution (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 100 mm Na2HPO4), pH 7.8, and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with 30 pm125I-insulin diluted in binding buffer (KRP, pH 7.8, containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 1.3 mm CaCl2). Cells were then rinsed with KRP, pH 7.8, in order to remove the unbound ligand and further incubated at 37 °C in binding buffer to allow internalization. After the indicated times, the cells were washed twice with either KRP buffer, pH 7.8 (for determination of total cell associated radioactivity), or with KRP buffer, pH 4.0 (acid buffer, for enabling dissociation of surface-bound insulin). The cells were then lysed with 1 n NaOH. The fraction of total cell radioactivity dissociated by the acid washes was taken as representative of surface-bound insulin. The acid-resistant radioactivity in the lysates was taken as representative of internalized insulin. Degraded and intact 125I-insulin in the incubation media was determined by 10% trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described previously (15Formisano P. De Novellis G. Miele C. Tripodi F. Caruso M. Palumbo G. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16242-16246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rab5 GTP Loading—For the GTP overlay, the cells were solubilized in lysis buffer, precipitated with Rab5 antibodies, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was then soaked in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol for 1 h and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters as in Formisano et al. (35Formisano P. Oriente F. Fiory F. Caruso M. Miele C. Maitan M.A. Andreozzi F. Vigliotta G. Condorelli G. Beguinot F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6323-6333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). After the transfer, the filters were rinsed twice for 10 min in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.3% Tween 20, pH 7.5, and incubated with 2 μCi/ml [α-32P]GTP for 2 h. After six 5-min washes, the filters were autoradiographed. Quantitation was achieved by laser densitometry. Role of PI3K in Insulin Internalization—Prior to studying 125I-insulin binding and internalization, 3T3-hIR cells were exposed for 30 min to wortmannin (50 nm) or LY294002 (100 μm), to inhibit PI3K activity, and to PD98059 (50 μm) and bisindolylmaleimide (100 nm), to inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase and PKC, respectively (Fig. 1). When evaluated at 4 °C, insulin binding levels were not affected by any of these treatments. The incubation of the cells at 37 °C led to a time-dependent reduction of surface binding. However, wortmannin- or LY294002-treated cells displayed a less marked loss of surface 125I-insulin compared with either control cells or to cells exposed to PD98059 and bisindolylmaleimide (Fig. 1A). Both untreated cells and cells exposed to PD98059 and bisindolylmaleimide internalized up to 60% of bound insulin in 30 min. Moreover, the intracellular radioactivity decreased upon further incubation (Fig. 1B). Wortmannin and LY294002 treatment of the cells caused a reduction of insulin internalization (only 35–40% of bound insulin was internalized in 30 min). This reduction was no longer detectable after 45 min, and after 60 min, a larger amount of labeled insulin accumulated intracellularly, compared with the control and PD98059- or bisindolylmaleimide-treated cells. Consistent with slower kinetics, the insulin internalization rate was reduced by 50% upon pre-exposure of the cells to either wortmannin or LY294002 but was not affected by PD98059 and bisindolylmaleimide (Fig. 1C). Thus, inhibitors of PI3K impaired insulin internalization in 3T3-hIR cells. Role of PI3K in Activation of Downstream Kinases—In order to investigate PI3K-dependent mechanisms involved in insulin internalization, the activities of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt and protein kinase C (PKC)-α, -δ, and -ζ were assessed upon the incubation of 3T3-hIR cells with LY294002. Treatment of the cells with LY294002 reduced insulin-stimulated activation of PKCα, and -δ by only 15% (not statistically significant) and 60%, respectively. In contrast, a very marked decrease was observed with PKCζ activation (90% inhibition of insulin-stimulated activity) (Fig. 2A). Moreover, PKB/Akt phosphorylation was strongly induced by insulin in control cells and almost completely abolished in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 2B). Similarly, increases in PKB/Akt activity were prevented when PI3K was inhibited (data not shown). Thus, it appears that PI3K inhibition causes a marked impairment of the activation of PKCζ and PKB/Akt by insulin. Role of PKCζ in Insulin Internalization—Next, we addressed the role of PKCs and PKB/Akt in insulin endocytosis. Overexpression of PKCδ did not significantly alter insulin internalization (Fig. 3). In addition, transient transfection either of wt-PKB/Akt1 or of a constitutively active mutant (myr-PKB) showed no effect on insulin internalization. However, PKCζ overexpression in 3T3-hIR cells, at levels comparable with those obtained for PKCδ (Fig. 3A), increased insulin internalization by 100% over control (Fig. 3B). The increased internalization positively correlated to the amount of transfected PKCζ cDNA. 50, 150, and 230% increases were achieved by 3-, 10-, and 20-fold overexpression of PKCζ, respectively (Fig. 3C). To analyze whether endogenous PKCζ was relevant for insulin internalization, 3T3-hIR cells were transfected with either PKCζ antisense oligonucleotides (PKCζ-AS) or with a dominant negative PKCζ mutant (DN-PKCζ) (Fig. 4A). Both procedures caused >70% inhibition of basal and insulin-induced PKCζ activity (data not shown). Insulin internalization was not affected by control oligonucleotides (PKCζ-S) and by transfection of a control vector (Fig. 4B). In contrast, in cells treated with PKCζ-AS or DN-PKCζ, insulin internalization was reduced by 50% compared with controls (Fig. 4B). PKCδ antisense (PKCδ-AS) and control scrambled oligonucleotides (PKCδ-S) did not significantly alter insulin internalization in 3T3-hIR cells. In addition, inhibition of PKB by DN-PKB or by treatment of the cells with ML9, an agent that blocks PKB with no effect on PI3K activity (36Smith U. Carvalho E. Mosialou E. Beguinot F. Formisano P. Rondinone C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), did not reduce insulin internalization (Fig. 4). Role of PI3K and PKCζ in EGF Internalization—In order to evaluate the specific role of PKCζ in insulin internalization, epidermal growth factor (EGF) endocytosis was studied in NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the EGF receptor (3T3-EGFR). Clones of 3T3-EGFR cells were selected for having a number of EGF-binding sites (∼72,000 per cell) comparable with those for insulin in the 3T3-hIR cells (∼65,000 per cell). Ligand internalization was assessed in the absence or in the presence of LY294002, or following transfection of wild type and DN-PKCζ (Fig. 5A). As expected, inhibition of PI3K resulted in 50% decreased EGF internalization (Fig. 5B). However, transfection of wt-PKCζ, although robustly increasing insulin internalization in 3T3-hIR, produced only a 30% increase in EGF internalization. Conversely, when DN-PKCζ was overexpressed, EGF internalization was only slightly reduced in 3T3-EGFR cells (20% decrease; not statistically significant). Consistent with a minor role of PKCζ in EGF internalization, treatment of 3T3-EGFR cells with EGF led to a modest 30% increase of PKCζ activity (Fig. 5C). Also, in untransfected NIH-3T3 cells, insulin, but not EGF, elicited a significant PKCζ activation (Fig. 5C). Role of PI3K and PKCζ in Liver Cells—To study the cell-specific role of PKCζ in control of insulin internalization, SV40-transformed murine hepatocytes (32Rother K.I. Imai Y. Caruso M. Beguinot F. Formisano P. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17491-17497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) were incubated with LY294002 or transfected with wild type or DN-PKCζ (Fig. 5A). Inhibition of PI3K or PKCζ was accompanied by a 45 and 40% reduction of insulin internalization, respectively (Fig. 5D). Conversely, overexpression of PKCζ led to a 70% increase of insulin internalization, indicating that PKCζ was also involved in insulin internalization in liver cells. Regulation of Insulin Intracellular Sorting by PI3K—After internalization, insulin may be degraded and degradation products released extracellularly. Alternatively, intact insulin may be released into the extracellular medium (4Marshall S. Garvey W.T. Monzon R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12005-12012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5McClain D.A. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1992; 304: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). LY294002 treatment of 3T3-hIR cells caused a 55% inhibition of total extracellular release (Fig. 6A). A 35% inhibition of insulin release was also observed when the cells were treated with ML9 (Fig. 6A). However, LY294002 inhibited insulin degradation by 50% and intact insulin release by >70% (Fig. 6, B and C). Most interesting, ML9 inhibited intact insulin release by ∼70% and had no significant effect on degradation (Fig. 7, B and C). We have therefore investigated whether PKB has a role in regulation of insulin intracellular sorting. To this end, total insulin release, insulin degradation, and intact insulin release were studied in cells transfected with either wt-PKBα, myr-PKB, PKCδ, or PKCζ. Total insulin release was increased by 80, 120, and 150% by PKCζ, wt-PKB, or myr-PKB overexpression, respectively. In addition, total insulin release was inhibited by about 50% when dominant negative mutants of either PKCζ or PKB were transfected in 3T3-hIR cells (Fig. 7A). However, PKCζ induced parallel increases in both insulin degradation and intact insulin release, whereas overexpression of either wt- or myr-PKB selectively increased the release of intact insulin by >100%, with a minor effect on degradation (Fig. 7, B and C). Again, no change was detected when PKCδ was overexpressed. Thus, when normalized for the amount of internalized insulin, only PKB, but not PKCζ, increased the release of intact insulin. Similar results were also obtained in SV40 immortalized hepatocytes (data not shown).Fig. 7Effect of PKB and PKCζ on insulin degradation and release. 3T3-hIR cells were transiently transfected with control plasmid (PC), PKCδ, PKCζ, a dominant negative PKCζ mutant (PKCζ-DN), PKB/Akt, a constitutively active (myr-PKB) or a dominant negative mutant (PKB-DN) of PKB/Akt cDNAs as indicated. Total insulin release (A), degraded insulin (B), and intact insulin (C) were measured upon 1 h at 37 °C, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bars represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations of five independent experiments. Based on t test analysis, for total insulin release (A) and intact insulin release (B), values measured in cells overexpressing PKCζ, PKCζ-DN, PKB/Akt, PKB-myr, and PKB-DN were significantly different compared with those in control and PC cells (p < 0.001). For insulin degradation, values measured in cells overexpressing PKCζ and PKCζ-DN were significantly different compared with those in control and PC cells (p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Role of Rab5 in Insulin Internalization and Sorting—To further investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating insulin internalization and release, 3T3-hIR cells were transiently transfected with Rab5 cDNAs, either alone or in combination with dominant negative PKCζ. Insulin internalization was about 100 and 150% increased upon overexpression of Rab5 and of a constitutively active Rab5 mutant (act-Rab5), respectively (Fig. 8A). In addition, a dominant negative Rab5 (DN-Rab5) construct reduced insulin internalization by 50% in the 3T3-hIR cells (Fig. 8B). Treatment of DN-Rab5 transfected cells with LY294002 did not induce any further decrease. Also, both insulin degradation and intact insulin release were increased in Rab5 and act-Rab5 transfected cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 9). Most interesting, in cells co-transfected with act-Rab5 and DN-PKCζ, insulin internalization (Fig. 8A), degradation, and intact insulin release (Fig. 9) were also increased, indicating that Rab5 activation bypassed the effect of inhibiting PKCζ. In contrast there was no Rab5 rescue of intact insulin release when PKB was inhibited (Fig. 9B).Fig. 9Effect of Rab5 on insulin degradation and release. 3T3-hIR cells were transiently transfected with control plasmid (PC), wild-type Rab5 (Rab5), a constitutively active mutant of Rab5 (act-Rab5), dominant negative PKCζ (PKCζ-DN) or with both act-Rab5 and PKCζ-DN. 100 μm ML-9 was added 15 min before insulin binding and for further incubation at 37 °C for measuring degradation and intact insulin release, where indicated. Then insulin degradation (A) and intact insulin release (B) were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bars represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations of four independent experiments. Based on t test analysis, insulin degradation and intact insulin release measured in cells overexpressing Rab5, act-Rab5, and DN-PKCζ and co-transfected with DN-PKCζ and act-Rab5 were significantly different compared with those in control and PC cells (p < 0.005). Insulin degradation in act-Rab5-overexpressing cells, treated with ML-9, was significantly different from that in control and PC cells (p < 0.005). Also intact insulin release was significantly different in both untransfected and act-Rab5-transfected cells treated with ML-9 compared with that in untreated control and PC cells (p < 0.005).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we performed co-precipitation experiments in 3T3-hIR cells transiently co-transfected with Rab5 and PKCζ, or with the dominant negative Rab5 and PKCζ mutants. Most interesting, wt-PKCζ co-precipitated with either wt- or DN-Rab5, whereas DN-PKCζ failed to interact with Rab5, indicating that PKCζ activity was necessary for this interaction (Fig. 10A). To evaluate the effect of PKCζ on Rab5 function, we measured Rab5 GTP loading in cells co-transfected with Rab5 and either wt- or DN-PKCζ. PKCζ overexpression caused a 50% increase of GTP binding to Rab5, whereas the dominant negative mutant caused a 30% decrease when compared with control cells (Fig. 10B). In this paper, we have investigated the involvement of major signaling pathways in insulin endocytosis. Although IR activation is required for internalization of insulin-IR complexes (12Backer J.M. Shoelson S.E. Haring E. White M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1535-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Carpentier J.L. Paccaud J.P. Gorden P. Rutter W.J. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5001-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the role of the molecules downstream from the receptor kinase in the control of the endocytic process is largely unknown. We have addressed this issue by studying NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing human insulin receptor at relatively low levels in order to preserve the normal intracellular routing. We have also investigated the regulation of insulin endocytosis in a liver-derived murine cell line. Insulin signal transduction pathways and endocytosis have been extensively studied in these cellular systems (11Caruso M. Miele C. Oliva A. Condorelli G. Oriente F. Riccardi G. Capaldo B. Fiory F.

We show that PI3K is required for insulin internalization and further intracellular processing. The role of PI3K in the endocytosis of other tyrosine kinase receptors has been shown previously (17Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F.S. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 18Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Corvera S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 272: 30519-30525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms remain unclear. Overexpression and antisense studies have now defined a specific role for PKCζ in insulin internalization. In contrast, EGF internalization, which is also blunted by PI3K inhibitors, is not affected by modulation of PKCζ expression and/or function. Similarly, transferrin internalization is unchanged whether PKCζ is overexpressed or inhibited (data not shown), indicating that PKCζ may play a selective role in regulating the trafficking of insulin vesicles. Thus, common routes used by tyrosine kinase receptors might diverge at critical steps. Indeed, in IR overexpressing NIH-3T3 cells, insulin robustly elicits PKCζ activation and receptor co-precipitation (34Formisano P. Oriente F. Miele C. Caruso M. Auricchio R. Vigliotta G. Condorelli G. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13197-13202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas PKCζ activation was barely detectable in the NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing the EGFR. Also, in untransfected cells insulin, and not EGF, stimulated PKCζ activation. PI3K activation represents a pivotal common step in insulin and EGF signaling systems, whereas PKCζ appears to play a specific role in insulin signaling and endocytic itinerary. PKCζ is involved in insulin regulation of glucose uptake (38Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 39Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Moscat J. Farese R.V.

Recently, Braiman et al. (40Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Perez L. Price D. Galloway L. Poklepovic A. Sajan M.P. Cenni V. Sirri A. Moscat J. Toker A. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25308-25316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have presented evidence that PKCζ phosphorylates VAMP-2, an important component of trafficking vesicles. We and others (34Formisano P. Oriente F. Miele C. Caruso M. Auricchio R. Vigliotta G. Condorelli G. Beguinot F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13197-13202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 40Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Perez L. Price D. Galloway L. Poklepovic A. Sajan M.P. Cenni V.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25308-25316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have shown previously that insulin receptor recruits and activates PKCζ in a biphasic manner. It is possible that distinct subsets of PKCζ molecules control distinct signals (i.e. insulin internalization and GLUT translocation) in a time- and/or location-dependent fashion. Alternatively, the effect of PKCζ on IR internalization might generate signals which, in turn, regulate glucose metabolism. In support of the latter hypothesis, Ceresa and co-workers (9Ceresa B.P. Kao A.W. Santeler S.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3862-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) have shown that inhibition of IR internalization suppresses insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. We have also reported that ligand-independent internalization of a mutant insulin receptor correlated with an increase of insulin-independent glucose uptake in NIH-3T3 and L6 cells (11Caruso M. Miele C. Oliva A. Condorelli G. Oriente F. Riccardi G. Capaldo B. Fiory F. Accili D. Formisano P. Beguinot F. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1194-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15Formisano P.

Formisano P. Rondinone C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PKCδ has also been described to regulate both glucose uptake and IR internalization in primary cultured skeletal muscle cells (41Braiman L. Alt A. Kuroki T. Ohba M. Bak A. Tennenbaum T. Sampson S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7852-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 42Braiman L. Alt A. Kuroki T. Ohba M. Bak A. Tennenbaum T. Sampson S.R. Mol.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 565-574PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that distinct PKC isoforms might play similar roles in different cell types. Here we show that PKCζ regulates insulin internalization and degradation in mouse hepatocytes, suggesting it may be involved in the control of insulin clearance from the circulation. Several lines of evidence indicate that PKCζ regulation of insulin internalization is exerted, at least in part, through Rab5. First, as shown in this paper, overexpression of Rab5 increases insulin internalization, in a similar manner to PKCζ. Second, a constitutively active Rab5 mutant bypasses the blockade of insulin internalization upon PKCζ inhibition. Third, activated PKCζ can interact with Rab5, suggesting a direct regulation of Rab5 function. For instance, Rab5 GTP loading can be modulated by PI3K (44Huang J. Imamura T. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13084-13089Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and is substantially increased in PKCζ-overexpressing cells. Once internalized, insulin is sorted to either the degradative or the recycling compartment, in a cell type-specific fashion (45Mc Clain D.A. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1998; 37: 806-815Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It appears that the intracellular sorting is not affected by PKCζ. Previous studies indicated that cPKCs could be involved (35Formisano P. Oriente F. Fiory F. Caruso M. Miele C. Maitan M.A. Andreozzi F. Vigliotta G. Condorelli G. Beguinot F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6323-6333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Here we show that overexpression of PKBα selectively increased intact insulin release, independently of internalization and degradation in fibroblasts (Figs. 6 and 7) and in liver cells (data not shown). One might argue that, beside exerting parallel functions in regulation of glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis (46Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 47Oriente F. Formisano P. Miele C. Fiory F. Maitan M.A. Vigliotta G. Trencia A. Santopietro S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37109-37119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), PKCζ and PKBα control different steps of the insulin endocytic itinerary. Distinct subsets of trafficking vesicles are likely involved in PKCζ and PKBα control of insulin endocytosis. Indeed, intact insulin release appears to be only indirectly regulated by Rab5. In this regard, overexpression of Rab5 is unable to rescue intact insulin release when PKB is inhibited, while completely bypassing the blockade on the release of both intact and degraded insulin when PKCζ is inhibited. In addition, PKB co-localizes with Rab4-containing vesicles (48Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1458-1464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 49Calera M.R. Martinez C. Liu H. Jack A.K. Birnbaum M.J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7201-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), suggesting a direct involvement in trafficking from the cell interior toward the plasma membrane. Thus, PI3K controls different steps of insulin endocytic itinerary in murine fibroblasts and hepatocytes. PI3K-mediated effects on early internalization events are mediated by PKCζ in a Rab5-dependent manner, whereas subsequent targeting toward intact insulin release is controlled by PKB in a Rab5-independent manner.

To study DBCCR1 function, stable cell lines, inducible for DBCCR1 expression by tetracycline, were made, but the DBCCR1 protein was not expressed at detectable levels. To understand the fate of DBCCR1-expressing cells, human bladder tumor cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector containing DBCCR1 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Initially, DBCCR1-EGFP-expressing cells demonstrated diffuse cytoplasmic green fluorescence with nuclear exclusion patterns. After time, the intensity level of green fluorescence increased and a granular distribution of protein became visible in the cells. At this point, cells rounded up and detached from the tissue culture dish. Cells transfected with a control vector, containing only EGFP, and partial DBCCR1-EGFP fusion constructs did not demonstrate this behavior. DBCCR1-mediated cell death in cultured tumor cells was independent of caspase-3 activation and did not result in detectable DNA strand breaks by TUNEL staining that are hallmarks of the classical apoptotic pathway."

Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 129-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because the outer membrane of E. coli contains lipopolysaccharide that constitutes a barrier for hydrophobic molecules, fatty acids are not able to cross it by diffusion but require the transport protein FadL. Protonated fatty acids then cross the bacterial inner membrane in a process favored by the proton gradient and are abstracted from the membrane and concomitantly trapped within the cell as acyl-CoA esters by the membrane-associated ACS, FadD (5DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Weimar J.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 129-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). FadL-mediated transport and the subsequent FadD-mediated formation of acyl-CoA esters is defined as vectorial acylation, a process that allows exogenous fatty acids to be used by bacteria as their energy source as well as a substrate for phospholipid biosynthesis. Thus, when no other carbon source is available, exogenous fatty acids are converted to acyl-CoA esters, which bind to the transcription factor FadR and derepress the expression of the fad genes that encode proteins responsible for fatty acid transport (FadL), activation (FadD), and β-oxidation (FadA, FadB, FadE, and FadH) (5DiRusso C.C. Black P.N. Weimar J.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 129-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). When alternative sources of carbon are available, bacteria synthesize fatty acids as acyl-ACPs, which are used for phospholipid synthesis but are not substrates for β-oxidation. Thus, acyl-CoA and acyl-ACP constitute independent pools of fatty acids destined for different fates. Contrasting with the single ACS present in bacteria, eukaryotes express multiple ACS isoforms that are not functionally equivalent (2Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Van Horn C.G. Gonzalez-Baró M.R. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2123-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Six yeast isoforms (Faap1–4, Fat1p, and Fat2p) have been cloned and characterized (6Johnson D.R. Knoll L.J. Levin D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Faap1 and Faap4 are essential for the utilization of exogenous fatty acids, because faa1Δfaa4Δ strains cannot grow when endogenous synthesis is inhibited by the fatty acid synthase inhibitor cerulenin unless supplemented with 14:0, 16:0, or 18:1 (3Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10861-10867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Faap2 activates endogenous medium chain fatty acids destined for β-oxidation in peroxisomes (7Hettema E.H. van Roermund C.W.T. Distel B. van den Berg M. Vilela C. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and Faap3 also uses endogenous fatty acids, but their specific fate is uncertain (8Johnson D.R. Knoll J.J.

J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In rats and humans, five long chain ACS isoforms 2Human FACL1 and FACL2 are the same gene (www.gene.ud.ac.uk/nomenclature/genefamily/acs.html). have been cloned (1Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M.

These isoforms have different substrate preferences, are expressed in different tissues, and are present in different subcellular locations. The expression of each of the rat isoforms is likely to be regulated independently. For example, ACS1 mRNA in different tissues is variously up-regulated by peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors α and γ (11Suzuki H. Watanabe M. Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biol.

These and other data suggest that rat ACS isoforms, like those of yeast, are not redundant but rather that they have distinct functions, possibly directing fatty acids to different metabolic pathways. In human skin fibroblasts, triacsin C, which inhibits ACS1 and 4 but not ACS5 (16Kim J.-H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24667-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), blocks de novo glycerolipid synthesis but does not affect lysophospholipid reacylation (17Igal R.A. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting that different ACS isoforms generate independent acyl-CoA pools that have specific fates. In similar experiments with rat hepatocytes, thiazolidinediones, which are inhibitors of rat ACS4 but not ACS1 or 5 (16Kim J.-H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol.

Girard J. Pegorier J.P. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1556-1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Female mice heterozygous for ACS4 gene inactivation have increased production of eicosanoids in uterine tissue and reduced fertility, suggesting that other isoforms cannot compensate for even a partial lack of ACS4 (19Cho Y.Y. Kang M.J. Sone H. Suzuki T. Abe M. Igarashi M. Tokunaga T. Ogawa S. Takei Y.A. Miyazawa T. Sasano H. Fujino T. Yamamoto T.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Expression of rat ACS1 rescues yeast faa1Δ faa4Δ strains and allows growth on a fermentable carbon source when cerulenin and exogenous long chain fatty acids are present (3Knoll L.J. Johnson D.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10861-10867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), indicating that a mammalian ACS can functionally substitute in a lower eukaryote. Because the long chain ACSs may have independent functions, we wondered whether they would vary in their ability to replace the single ACS in E. coli, FadD, in fatty acid vectorial transport and the activation of exogenously provided fatty acids. To answer this question, we transformed rat ACS1–5 into E. coli fadD and measured transport, β-oxidation, lipid synthesis, and growth in the presence of oleate as the only source of carbon and energy. Construction of Recombinant pFLAG-CTC-ACS Plasmids—Plasmids pFLAG-CTC-ACS1, -ACS4, and -ACS5 express the ACS isoforms as fusion proteins with a C-terminal FLAG epitope, under the control of a tac promoter (16Kim J.-H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24667-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To obtain cDNA clones of ACS2 and ACS3, rat total brain RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNAs were synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Rat ACS3 (GenBank™ accession number D30666) (22Fujino T. Kang M.-J. Suzuki H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16748-16752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the upper primer 5′-CTAAGCTTCACATGAATAACCACGTATCTTCAACAC-3′ and the lower primer 5′-AAGTCGACTTTTCTTCCGTACATCCGCTCAATG-3′. The product included the open reading frame flanked by the recognition sequences for HindIII and SalI restriction enzymes. Following digestion with HindIII and SalI, the amplified ACS3 cDNA was ligated into the pFLAG-CTC vector to produce pFLAG-CTC-ACS3. Rat ACS2 (GenBank™ accession number D10041) (23Fujino T. Yamamoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the upper primer 5′-ATAAGCTTAAGATGCAGACCCAGGAGATCCTG-3′ and the lower primer 5′-GTACTCGAGACATGGAGATTGAGTACAGCTCTTCT-3′ and ligated into pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ACS2 cDNA was excised with HindIII and XhoI and then ligated into the pFLAG-CTC vector to generate pFLAG-CTC-ACS2. The sequences of ACS2 and 3 were verified by automated DNA sequencing (UNC-CH Automated DNA Sequencing Facility). Strains, Transformation, and Culture Conditions—E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL was obtained from Stratagene and will be referred to as BL21(DE3)RIL or wild type throughout this paper. A strain containing a fadD deletion was generated by P1 transduction of BL21-(DE3)RIL with fadD::kan as described previously (24Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. Delio R. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29369-29376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and is referred to as BL21(DE3)RILfadD. A spontaneous fadR mutant was obtained by plating BL21(DE3)RIL on minimal medium containing decanoate (25DiRusso C.C. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 583-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant, BL21(DE3)RILfadR, constitutively expresses the fatty acid degradative enzymes (Fad) without oleate induction. It was transduced with a P1 bacteriophage grown on BL21(DE3)RILfadD to generate the strain BL21(DE3)RILfadR fadD. Bacteria were transformed by the Hanahan protocol (26Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8189) Google Scholar); strains transformed with pFLAG-CTC vector without an insert were used as control. For routine culture, liquid Terrific Broth (TB) medium (Invitrogen) and Luria-Bertani (LB) agar (Fisher) plates were used; 50 μg/ml carbenicillin (Invitrogen) was added to maintain the plasmids. Growth in liquid cultures was monitored by measuring optical density at 600 nm (A600). Frozen stocks were prepared in LB medium, 7% Me2SO and stored at –80 °C. Transport Assay—BL21(DE3)RILfadR fadD transformed with pFLAG derivatives of rat ACS 1–5 was used to inoculate an overnight culture in TB. The next morning the cells were subcultured at 1:100 dilution in the same medium. When growth reached mid-log phase, protein production was induced with 1 mm IPTG for 1 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation (3400 × g 15 min at room temperature), rinsed once with M9 medium (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431Google Scholar) and 0.5% Brij 58, resuspended in one-half volume of the same medium containing 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and starved for 15 min at 30 °C. Fatty acid transport was measured by adding 100 μm [3H]potassium oleate (final concentration). At 0, 2, 4, and 6 min aliquots were pipetted onto filter GN-6, washed twice with M9 0.5% Brij 58, air-dried, and counted (28Kumar G.B. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1348-1353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of Rat ACSs and fad Genes for β-Oxidation and Lipid Synthesis Experiments—Bacteria were grown overnight in 3 ml of TB medium at 37 °C with shaking. The next morning the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in medium E with 0.01 g/liter thiamine (Med EB1), 25 mm potassium acetate, 1 g/liter casamino acids. The cell density was adjusted to A600 ≈ 0.1, and the bacteria were grown in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks at 37 °C with shaking at 240 rpm. When the cultures reached mid-log phase (A600 ≈ 0.5), the expression of the recombinant rat ACS isoforms was induced with 1 mm IPTG. At the same time, in the BL21(DE3)RIL and BL21(DE3)RILfadD strains, the expression from the endogenous fad genes responsible for β-oxidation was induced with 5 mm potassium oleate in 0.5% Brij58 (29Overath P. Raufuss E.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 28-Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). No oleate was necessary for fadR and fadR fadD strains because these fadR mutants constitutively express the proteins of the fad regulon. The cultures were allowed to grow for 1 h, and aliquots were used to measure lipid incorporation. To measure β-oxidation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with Med EB1, 0.5% Brij58, 1 mm IPTG with no carbon source and resuspended in Med EB1, 1 mm IPTG, 0.1 g/liter chloramphenicol, bringing the cell concentration to A600 ≈ 1. The protein content was determined in separate aliquots. The remaining cultures were further processed to measure ACS activity and to perform immunoblot analyses. β-Oxidation Assay—To measure β-oxidation, 2-ml aliquots of the bacterial cultures described above were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking at 240 rpm with 500 μm [14C]oleic acid in 0.5% Brij58 in rubber-stoppered vials with center wells. Then 0.5 ml of 5 n H2SO4 was added to the medium to promote the evolution of [14C]CO2, which was trapped in center wells filled with 0.2 ml of ethanolamine:ethanol 1:1 (v/v). After an additional hour of shaking, the contents of the center wells were transferred to vials, and the [14C]CO2 produced was measured by scintillation counting (30Maloy S.R. Ginsburgh C.L. Simons R.W. Nunn W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3735-3742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results are presented as the means ± S.E. of a representative experiment, which was repeated two to six times for BL21(DE3)RIL wild type and fadD strains and twice with fadR and fadR fadD strains. The differences were analyzed by Student's t test. Lipid Synthesis—Bacteria were grown to mid-log phase, and the expression of rat ACS isoforms was induced for 1 h as described above. Then 1 ml of culture was incubated with 20 μm of [1-14C]oleate (1 μCi) (final concentration) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cultures were then chilled on ice and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.5% Brij58. The lipids were extracted (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42855) Google Scholar), and [14C]oleate incorporation was measured by scintillation counting. Incorporation into phospholipid species was determined by thin layer chromatography in CHCl3/ethanol/H2O/triethylamine (30/35/7/35; v/v) using authentic standards (32Leray C. Pelletier X. Hemmendinger S. Cazenave J.P. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 420: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Preparation of Bacterial Lysate—Bacterial cultures described above were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 rpm in a Sorval SA-600 rotor at 4 °C and resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm EDTA buffer. The bacteria were lysed by sonication on ice, with six 10-s bursts and 10-s rest intervals using a heat system ultrasonic cell disruptor sonicator (Heat Systems, Ultrasonics) at setting 4. Lysate aliquots were stored at –80 °C until used for enzyme assay. ACS Activity Assay—ACS activity was measured using 17–80 μg of bacterial lysate. The assays contained 175 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm ATP, 0.25 mm CoA, and 50 μm [14C]palmitic acid (New England Nuclear) in 0.5 mm Triton X-100, 0.01 mm EDTA in a total volume of 200 μl. The assays were performed at 37 °C for 5 min with shaking. The reaction was started by adding lysate protein and terminated by adding 1 ml of Dole's reagent (isopropanol, heptane, 1 m H2SO4 (80:20:2)). The unreacted free fatty acid was removed with two 2-ml heptane washes, and the labeled acyl-CoA produced by the reaction was measured by scintillation counting (33Banis R.J. Tove S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 348: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The assays measured initial rates. Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins from the bacterial lysate (1 or 2 μg) were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive bands were detected by incubating the membranes with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce), and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Reagent (Pierce). Growth Complementation of fadD Deletion—Bacteria were transformed with plasmids containing different isoforms of rat ACS or no insert. These were examined for their ability to grow on oleate as the sole energy and carbon source. Transformants were streaked on Med EB1 agar plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, 5 mm potassium oleate solubilized in 0.5% Brij 58 (final concentration), and different concentrations of IPTG (0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mm). Control plates were supplemented with 25 mm glucose and the appropriate concentration of IPTG. The plates were incubated at 37 °C, and growth was checked daily for 7 days. Other Methods—The protein content was measured using bovine serum albumin as the standard (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat ACS Isoforms 1–5 Are Expressed and Active in BL21(DE3)RILfadD—To determine whether rat ACS isoforms can functionally replace FadD, the sole ACS enzyme in bacteria, the coding region of fadD was deleted in BL21(DE3)RIL to generate strain BL21(DE3)RILfadD. The fadD strain had ACS activity levels indistinguishable from background and was unable to grow when oleate was the sole energy and carbon source (see Fig. 2 and Table I). BL21(DE3)RILfadD was transformed with the expression vector pFLAG-CTC-ACS1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 or with the empty vector as a control. The rat ACS isoforms were each expressed as a fusion protein with a C-terminal FLAG epitope. The FLAG epitope does not interfere with ACS activity or kinetic properties (16Kim J.-H. Lewin T.M. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24667-24673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).Table IOnly rat ACS5 complements absence of FadDStrainVectorEB1 media25 mm glucose5 mm oleateBL21 (DE3)RILEmpty++++++fadDACS1+++-ACS2+++-ACS3+++-ACS4+++-ACS5+++++fadREmpty++++++fadD fadRACS1+++-ACS2+++-ACS3+++-ACS4+++-ACS5+++++ Open table in a new tab All five ACS isoforms were expressed in BL21(DE3)RILfadD, with ACS1 and ACS4 exhibiting the greatest expression and ACS5 exhibiting the least (Fig. 1A). All of the isoforms exhibited ACS activity (Fig. 2A). In each case, the specific activity was at least 1.6-fold higher (ACS5) and as much as 20-fold higher (ACS4) than the specific activity of the bacterial enzyme FadD in the wild type control strain containing the empty vector. Further, the correlation was poor between expressed protein and enzyme activity. Although the expression of ACS4 protein was not substantially different from that of ACS1, ACS4 specific activity was 8-fold higher than that of ACS1, perhaps because ACS4 is a peripheral membrane protein like FadD. In contrast, ACS1 and ACS5 (and probably ACS2 and ACS3) are integral membrane proteins whose activity might be negatively affected by the composition of the bacterial membrane, which differs considerably from the phospholipid composition of mammalian membranes (35Raetz C.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1235-1238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat ACS Isoforms 1–5 Activate Exogenous Fatty Acids for β-Oxidation—When carbohydrate is not available, E. coli can import and activate exogenous fatty acids to acyl-CoA esters that are then oxidized to provide energy. BL21(DE3)RILfadD expressing each of the rat ACS isoforms was studied to determine whether these rat ACS isoforms would be able to supply fatty acyl-CoA for β-oxidation in the absence of FadD (Fig. 3A). As expected, BL21(DE3)RILfadD transformed with the empty vector was unable to oxidize exogenous oleate. However, transformation with rat ACS isoform 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 allowed some β-oxidation to occur, indicating that each of the rat ACS isoforms partially replaced FadD for this function. There was no correlation between in vitro specific activities of the ACS isoform and the rates of in vivo β-oxidation. Despite ACS activities that were 1.6–20-fold higher than that of the control BL21(DE3)RIL, which contains active FadD (Fig. 2), the relative rates of β-oxidation ([14C]CO2 produced/ACS activity) were 0.2–7.5% of those observed in the wild type strain (Fig. 3B). Thus, although the ACS isoforms were able to catalyze the formation of acyl-CoAs in vitro, either they did not form acyl-CoAs in vivo, the acyl-CoAs formed were not accessible to the β-oxidation enzymes, or the activities of the β-oxidation enzymes were limiting because of the presence of FadR. β-Oxidation by E. coli requires expression of the fad genes encoding proteins that mediate transport (FadL), activation (FadD), and β-oxidation of exogenous fatty acids (FadA, FadB, FadE, and FadH) (29Overath P. Raufuss E.-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 28-Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 36Overath P. Pauli G. Schairer H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 7: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). When carbohydrate is present, the transcription factor FadR represses the expression of these proteins. If long chain fatty acids are provided as the sole carbon and energy source in the culture medium, however, the resulting acyl-CoAs produced by the activity of FadD bind to FadR and regulate FadR activity (25DiRusso C.C. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 583-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by promoting the dissociation of FadR from the promoter region of the genes of the fad regulon, thereby inducing their expression (37DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the rat ACSs were not as efficient as FadD in providing the long chain acyl-CoA ligand for FadR, the fad genes might be expressed at low levels and limit β-oxidation. To rule out this possibility, we generated BL21(DE3)RILfadR and fadR fadD strains. These strains have a mutation in the fadR gene that leads to constitutive expression of FadL and the β-oxidation enzymes, independent of the presence of acyl-CoA. Expression of the ACS isoforms and their activities in the fadD fadR strain were similar to that shown for BL21(DE3)RILfadD (Figs. 1B and 2B). As expected, β-oxidation in BL21(DE3)RILfadR was 3.7-fold higher than observed in the wild type strain (compare the first bars in Fig. 3, A and C). However, the rescue of fadR fadD by the five rat ACS isoforms was still only partial (Fig. 3C); the values for relative β-oxidation remained low for ACS 1–4 at 0.6–16% of the positive control BL21(DE3)RILfadR (Fig. 3D). In contrast, relative β-oxidation for fadDfadR bacteria expressing ACS5 was 55% of the fadR control. The lower efficiency of rat ACS isoforms 1–4 was not due to low expression of FadL or limiting enzymes of β-oxidation. In both the fadD (Fig. 3B) and fadD fadR (Fig. 3D) strains, ACS5 had the highest rate of β-oxidation relative to expression of activity. Rat ACS Isoforms 1–5 Partially Restore Fatty Acid Transport in BL21(DE3)RILfadR fadD—FadD and FadL comprise the E. coli fatty acid import system that pairs fatty acid transport and acylation (5DiRusso C.C.

https://openalex.org/W2028682069,"Entamoeba histolytica, an early branching eukaryote, is the etiologic agent of amebiasis. Calcium plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of amebiasis by modulating the cytopathic properties of the parasite. However, the mechanistic role of Ca2+ and calcium-binding proteins in the pathogenesis of E. histolytica remains poorly understood. We had previously characterized a novel calcium-binding protein (EhCaBP1) from E. histolytica. Here, we report the identification and partial characterization of an isoform of this protein, EhCaBP2. Both EhCaBPs have four canonical EF-hand Ca2+ binding domains. The two isoforms are encoded by genes of the same size (402 bp). Comparison between the two genes showed an overall identity of 79% at the nucleotide sequence level. This identity dropped to 40% in the 75-nucleotide central linker region between the second and third Ca2+ binding domains. Both of these genes are single copy, as revealed by Southern hybridization. Analysis of the available E. histolytica genome sequence data suggested that the two genes are non-allelic. Homology-based structural modeling showed that the major differences between the two EhCaBPs lie in the central linker region, normally involved in binding target molecules. A number of studies indicated that EhCaBP1 and EhCaBP2 are functionally different. They bind different sets of E. histolytica proteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Activation of endogenous kinase was also found to be unique for the two proteins and the Ca2+ concentration required for their optimal functionality was also different. In addition, a 12-mer peptide was identified from a random peptide library that could differentially bind the two proteins. Our data suggest that EhCaBP2 is a new member of a class of E. histolytica calcium-binding proteins involved in a novel calcium signal transduction pathway. Entamoeba histolytica, an early branching eukaryote, is the etiologic agent of amebiasis. Calcium plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of amebiasis by modulating the cytopathic properties of the parasite. However, the mechanistic role of Ca2+ and calcium-binding proteins in the pathogenesis of E. histolytica remains poorly understood. We had previously characterized a novel calcium-binding protein (EhCaBP1) from E. histolytica. Here, we report the identification and partial characterization of an isoform of this protein, EhCaBP2. Both EhCaBPs have four canonical EF-hand Ca2+ binding domains. The two isoforms are encoded by genes of the same size (402 bp). Comparison between the two genes showed an overall identity of 79% at the nucleotide sequence level. This identity dropped to 40% in the 75-nucleotide central linker region between the second and third Ca2+ binding domains. Both of these genes are single copy, as revealed by Southern hybridization. Analysis of the available E. histolytica genome sequence data suggested that the two genes are non-allelic. Homology-based structural modeling showed that the major differences between the two EhCaBPs lie in the central linker region, normally involved in binding target molecules. A number of studies indicated that EhCaBP1 and EhCaBP2 are functionally different. They bind different sets of E. histolytica proteins in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Activation of endogenous kinase was also found to be unique for the two proteins and the Ca2+ concentration required for their optimal functionality was also different. In addition, a 12-mer peptide was identified from a random peptide library that could differentially bind the two proteins. Our data suggest that EhCaBP2 is a new member of a class of E. histolytica calcium-binding proteins involved in a novel calcium signal transduction pathway. Ca2+ is a ubiquitous second messenger involved in signal transduction processes in eukaryotes (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ gradients initiate a number of cellular processes including cell migration, exocytosis, activation of killer lymphocyte cells, cellular secretion, transcellular ion transport, neurotransmitter release, and gap junction regulation (2Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). These processes are essentially mediated by a variety of Ca2+-binding proteins (CaBPs), 1The abbreviations used are: CaBP, calcium-binding protein; CaM, calmodulin; nt, nucleotide; MD, molecular dynamics; ORF, open reading frame; pC112, synthetic peptide C112; pC61, synthetic peptide C61; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; TMB, 3,3′,4,4′-tetramethylbenzidine. which are involved in binding Ca2+ and transducing the signal through downstream effectors. Calmodulin (CaM), a four EF-hand, highly conserved CaBP has been found in almost all eukaryotic cells and has been implicated in a large number of cellular processes (for review, see Ref. 3Chin D Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signaling also plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of many protozoan parasites (4Scheibel L.W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 134: 165-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In Plasmodium, the expression of CaM has been shown to be stage-specific and is involved in erythrocyte invasion as well as schizont maturation (5Matsumoto Y. Perry G. Scheibel L.W. Aikawa M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 45: 36-43PubMed Google Scholar). Chelation of Ca2+ can prevent hepatocyte invasion by merozoites (6Johnson J.G. Epstein N. Shiroishi T. Miller L.H. J. Protozool. 1981; 28: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Ca2+ is also involved in invasion of host cells by trypanosomatids (7Pereira C. Paveto C. Espinosa J. Alonso G. Flawia M.M. Torres H.N. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1997; 44: 155-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Treatments that decrease or increase cytoplasmic Ca2+ modify Trypanosoma cruzi infectivity (8Yakubu M.A. Majumder S. Kierszenbaum F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Besides, Ca2+ also regulates various other cellular processes, such as apoptosis, loss of motility, environmental sensing, and excystation (9Modha J. Roberts M.C. Robertson W.M. Sweetman G. Powell K.A. Kennedy M.W. Kusel J.R. Parasitology. 1999; 118: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 10Bernal R.M. Tovar R. Santos J.I. Munoz M.L. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amebiasis, Ca2+ is reported to be involved in its pathophysiology by initiating the amebic cytolytic activity (for a recent review, see Ref. 11Meza I. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 23-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Amebic cytolytic activity could be blocked by Ca2+ channel blockers, or by treatment with EGTA (12Ravdin J.I. Moreau F. Sullivan J.A. Petri Jr., W.A. Mandell G.L. Infect. Immunol. 1988; 56: 1505-1512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas stimulation of amebic PKC activity with phorbol esters enhanced lysis of target epithelial cells (13Weikel C.S. Murphy C.F. Orozco E. Ravdin J.I. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1485-1491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in the Ca2+ profile were also related to the cell cycle and the developmental stages of the parasite i.e. the cyst or the trophozoite stage (14Ganguly A. Lohia A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, extracellular Ca2+, amebic intracellular Ca2+ flux, bepridil-sensitive Ca2+ channels and a putative CaM-dependent signal transduction pathway have been implicated in the growth and encystation of Entamoeba (15Makioka A. Kumagai M. Ohtomo H. Kobayashi S. Takeuchi T. Parasitol. Res. 2001; 87: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Ca2+ is thus speculated to play a direct role in precipitating the cytopathic effects of E. histolytica. A number of CaBPs have been identified in E. histolytica (4Scheibel L.W. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 134: 165-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Among these are two related EF-hand-containing proteins, grainin 1 and 2, which are localized in intracellular granules (16Nickel R. Jacobs T. Urban B. Scholze H. Bruhn H. Leippe M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). They may be involved in phagocytosis, control of endocytotic pathways and Ca2+-dependent granular discharge. Another protein, URE3-BP, was shown to have a transcription regulatory function with Ca2+-dependent DNA binding properties (17Gilchrist C.A. Holm C.F. Hughes M.A. Schaenman J.M. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11838-11843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Gilchrist C.A. Leo M. Line C.G. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4646-4653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CaM-dependent secretion of collagenases from electron dense granules has been demonstrated using Entamoeba lysate but a direct evidence for the presence of CaM is still lacking (19Munoz Mde L. Moreno M.A. Perez-Garcia J.N. Tovar G.R. Hernandez V.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1707-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Munoz M.L. O'Shea-Alvarez M.S. Perez-Garcia J. Weinbach E.C. Moreno M.A. de la Torre M. Magos M.A. Tovar R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1992; 103: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We had previously characterized a CaBP (EhCaBP1) from E. histolytica (21Prasad J. Bhattacharya S. Bhattacharya A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 52: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Prasad J. Bhattacharya S. Bhattacharya A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar). EhCaBP1 has 134 amino acid residues with four canonical EF-hand Ca2+ binding domains. Though this protein has some structural similarity with CaM, it is functionally quite distinct (23Yadava N. Chandok M.R. Prasad J. Bhattacharya S. Sopory S.K. Bhattacharya A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Inducible expression of EhCaBP1 antisense RNA demonstrated its role in cellular proliferation (24Sahoo N. Chakrabarty P. Yadava N. Bhattacharya S. Bhattacharya A. Arch. Med. Res. 2000; 31: S57-S59Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Sahoo N. Bhattacharya S. Bhattacharya A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Structural studies on EhCaBP1 have revealed an organization similar to CaM, having two independent globular domains connected by a flexible linker. It consists of four canonical EF-hands, a pair each in the N- and C-terminal domains. The Ca2+ binding loops in the protein consist of 12 contiguous residues flanked by two helices, which are, oriented nearly perpendicular to each other, a feature shared by other members of the family of EF-hand proteins (26Gopal B. Suma R. Murthy M.R. Bhattacharya A. Bhattacharya S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EhCaBP1 is structurally related to CaM and Troponin C (TnC) despite low sequence homology with these proteins. The major differences in the structure of EhCaBP1 with respect to CaM and TnC are in the Ca2+ binding loops, interhelical angles and exposed hydrophobic surface. These differences have led to a more open conformation for the Ca2+ binding loops in the C-terminal domain of EhCaBP1 compared with the ones in the N-terminal domain and higher solvent exposure of the hydrophobic residues (27Sahu S.C. Bhattacharya A. Chary K.V. Govil G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Atreya H.S. Sahu S.C. Bhattacharya A. Chary K.V. Govil G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14392-14403Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In EhCaBP1, the linker region exhibits a large structural flexibility, leading to an ill-defined orientation of the two domains (N- and C-terminal) with respect to each other. These structural features make EhCaBP1 functionally distinct from other CaM-like Ca2+-binding proteins. In this study, we report the identification and partial characterization of EhCaBP2, a paralog of EhCaBP1, and show that these two proteins are functionally distinct. Strains and Cell Growth—E. histolytica strain HM1:IMSS was maintained at 36 °C in TYI-S-33 medium with appropriate antibiotics (29Diamond L.S. Harlow D.R. Cunnick C.C. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1978; 72: 431-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Southern and Northern Hybridization—Total DNA was purified from late-log phase grown cells, as described earlier (30Chandok M.R. Sopory S.K. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 2255-2258Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA, digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and separated on an agarose gel, was transferred to nylon membranes. Southern blots were hybridized in a solution containing 1% SDS, 1 m NaCl, and 3 × 105 cpm ml-1 of DNA probe at 65 °C for 16 h. Blots were washed according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposed for autoradiography. Radioactive DNA probes were prepared using the NEBlot random priming kit (NEB). Total RNA was purified using TriPure reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturers' instructions. RNA samples (30 μg) were denatured by incubating with 6 m deionized glyoxal, 50% (v/v) Me2SO and 1× gel running buffer (12 mm Tris-HCl, 6 mm sodium acetate, and 0.3 m EDTA, pH 7.0) at 50 °C and electrophoresed in a 1.2% (w/v) Tris acetate-EDTA (TAE) agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was blotted on to a GeneScreen plus (GS+) nylon membrane (NEN), and hybridization was carried out at 42 °C in 50% formamide-containing hybridization buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polymerase Chain Reaction—Primers to amplify the EhCaBP2 ORF were designed based on the Entamoeba GSS sequence data base. The primers used (Primer 1: 5′-GGGAAACATATGTCATTACAAAAGATT-3′ and Primer 2: 5′-GGGAAAGGATCCTTAAAGATTGAATGC-3′) were obtained from Microsynth, Switzerland. PCR was performed with 400 ng of E. histolytica genomic DNA. The conditions were: 92 °C, 5 min; 36 °C, 1 min; 70 °C, 1 min (5 cycles); 92 °C, 1 min; 56 °C, 1 min; 70 °C, 1 min (25 cycles). The PCR products were cloned in pGEMTeasy vector (Promega) and subsequently in pET30a vector (Novagen) for expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The primer set 3-4 was used to amplify reverse-transcribed products obtained from total HM1:IMSS RNA (primer 3: 5′-GTTCAAGTATAAATTCATTACAAAAGATT-3′; Primer 4: 5′-GTTCTTTAACAGCAGCTGCA-3′). The conditions used were 92 °C, 1 min; 48 °C, 1 min; 70 °C, 1 min (30 cycles). Expression and Purification of Recombinant EhCaBP2 in E. coli—The purification of recombinant EhCaBP2 was carried out essentially as described earlier (22Prasad J. Bhattacharya S. Bhattacharya A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar). Induced bacterial cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 and 2 mm EGTA and lysed by freeze-thaw followed by sonication. Heat treatment of the lysed cells was carried out by incubation in a boiling water bath for 3 min followed by separation of heat-precipitable E. coli cellular proteins. The supernatant, containing recombinant EhCaBP2, was purified using ion-exchange chromatography employing methods described earlier (22Prasad J. Bhattacharya S. Bhattacharya A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 167-175PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+-free EhCaBP2 was prepared with the help of Chelex 100 as described (31Gopal B. Swaminathan C.P. Bhattacharya S. Bhattacharya A. Murthy M.R. Surolia A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10910-10916Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Affinity Purification of EhCaBP-binding Proteins—The EhCaBP-binding proteins were purified using the respective EhCaBP-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described before (23Yadava N. Chandok M.R. Prasad J. Bhattacharya S. Sopory S.K. Bhattacharya A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The soluble cytoplasmic fraction was first diluted in Buffer C (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm imidazole, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and passed through EhCaBP-Sepharose 4B column (4-6 mg of protein per ml of bed volume). Unbound proteins were washed with 10 bed volumes of Buffer C. The bound proteins were eluted with Buffer D (same as Buffer C except that CaCl2 is replaced with 2 mm EGTA) as 1-ml fractions. The chromatographic steps were carried out at 4 °C. The eluates were dialyzed against water and then concentrated by centrifugal evaporation. Laser Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF)—MALDI-TOF spectrometry was used to analyze EhCaBP-binding proteins. The matrix was prepared using sinapinic acid in 30% (v/v) acetonitrile, and 0.33% trichloroacetic acid, and the samples were analyzed by a MALDI-TOF spectrometer (Kratos PCKOMPACT SEQ model). The mass calibration was carried out using the MS-CAL1 mass calibration kit for MALDI-MS (Sigma). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Total Entamoeba cell extract was prepared and the activity of Ca2+-dependent kinases was estimated according to Chandok and Sopory (30Chandok M.R. Sopory S.K. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 2255-2258Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 μg of histone (Type IIIS, Sigma), 30 μg of E. histolytica cell extract, protease inhibitor mixture, CaCl2 or EGTA, and 100 pmol of peptide where indicated. The reaction volume was adjusted to 50 μl. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 μm [γ-32P]rATP (specific activity 5000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 10% trichloroacetic acid, which precipitated total protein in the reaction mixture. The pellet was washed with diethyl ether/ethanol (1:1) mixture and after drying the pellet, and spotting the rehydrated pellet on GF/C paper, the amount of radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. For visualization of phosphorylated products, the reaction mixture after termination was separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE. The fluorographed gels were dried and exposed to an x-ray film. In competition experiments involving peptides, reactions were performed under identical conditions using E. histolytica total cell lysate preincubated with indicated amounts of peptide(s). Ca2+-dependent Phage ELISA—Phages were prepared according to standard procedures and phage ELISA assays were performed essentially as described earlier (32Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). However, certain changes were introduced to ensure that the phage binding was Ca2+-dependent. The phages were allowed to bind to the EhCaBPs in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. The plates were washed in TBST containing either 2 mm CaCl2 or 4 mm EGTA, and the bound phages were detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-M13 monoclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences; 1:3000 dilution) with TMB substrate (Amersham Biosciences) at 410 nm. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Binding kinetics of phages to protein was determined using IAsys Auto+ (Affinity sensor). Amplified phages (1011 pfu/ml) from a 20-ml culture were precipitated and dissolved in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Phages were biotinylated using established protocols (33Manivel V. Bayiroglu F. Siddiqui Z. Salunke D.M. Rao K.V. J. Immunol. 2000; 169: 888-897Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Biotinylated phages were immobilized onto streptavidin bound on a biotin-coated surface. For determination of association rate constants, EhCaBPs (25-400 μm) in the binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) were used. Following analyte binding, dissociation rate constants were measured by replacing the sample with binding buffer. The surface was regenerated with the regeneration buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EGTA). Kinetics of the interaction of EhCaBPs with phages were analyzed by non-linear regression using FASTfit software package supplied with IAsys instrument. Sequence Analysis—Preliminary sequence data for E. histolytica is deposited regularly into the GSS division of GenBank™ and was used for this analysis. The sequencing effort is part of the International Entamoeba Genome Sequencing Project and is supported by award from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health. The Entamoeba genome sequence data base from the Sanger Centre (www.sanger.ac.uk) supported by the Welcome trust was also used. BLAST searches (NCBI: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) were used for finding homologues of EhCaBPs. ClustalW (EMBL: www.ebi.ac.uk) was used for alignment of multiple sequences. Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling was carried out using the Modeler (34Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) interface of INSIGHTII (Molecular Simulations Inc.) The model was built on the basis of the NMR solution structure (1JFK) of the Ca2+-bound form of EhCaBP1 (28Atreya H.S. Sahu S.C. Bhattacharya A. Chary K.V. Govil G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14392-14403Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The constructed model was minimized initially with full backbone constraints, which were gradually relaxed as the minimization proceeded. The final model was validated by PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulation was carried out to explore the conformational variation existing in the flexible linker region between the two domains in EhCaBP1 and EhCaBP2. 10 ps of equilibration at 300 K were followed by 100 ps of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The MD simulation was carried out for the 13 residues of the linker region with maximum variability, while the rest of the structure was constrained. RMSD for 10 representative MD-derived structures of the linker region (residues 55-67) was found to be 0.32 Å suggesting no significant variation from the average structure. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD measurements were performed using a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter. Each spectrum was measured in the far-UV region (200-270 nm) and was an average of five scans. Scans were done at a protein concentration of 1 μm using a cuvette of pathlength 1 cm. Percentage helical content was calculated using the method described by Barrow et al. (36Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T.M. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Miscellaneous Methods—The concentration of protein in a sample was estimated by bicinchoninic acid assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (37Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis was carried out in 10 or 14% acrylamide gels, as indicated, under reducing conditions according to Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, the gels were subjected to fluorography as described by Laskey and Mills (39Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 56: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar). Peptides (Peptide C61, pC61:GAWYPREASTAS; Peptide C112, pC112: SMNLQTPGYKDG, Control 12-mer peptide, p12: YIPQPRPPHPGL) were synthesized. Peptides were desalted and purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 column and their amino acid sequence confirmed. Our laboratory had previously characterized a calcium-binding protein, EhCaBP, from E. histolytica (21Prasad J. Bhattacharya S. Bhattacharya A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 52: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A search for the presence of EhCaBP homologs in the E. histolytica genome sequence data base at NCBI revealed (in addition to an entry with complete match with EhCaBP) a sequence that showed a very high score and low p value (score = 163; p = 4e-38) using BLAST. The identified sequence was then used to find a contig that carried the entire coding region, from the genome data base at the Sanger Centre, UK (contig 4494). The second gene was designated as EhCaBP2 whereas the original gene was renamed EhCaBP1. The overall identity at the nucleotide level between EhCaBP2 and EhCaBP1 was 79% (Fig. 1A). Of the 80 nucleotides that differed in the two genes, 28 were in the third codon position, leaving the encoded amino acids unchanged. The conceptual translation product of EhCaBP2 was compared with EhCaBP1 and the alignment of the two sequences is shown in Fig. 1B. The amino acid sequences of the two proteins showed an identity of 78%. Both the proteins have four typical EF-hand Ca2+ binding domains. The level of similarity between the two proteins varied along the length of the sequence. The maximum identity was observed in the Ca2+ binding domains with a total of 6 amino acid substitutions (Fig. 1B). The minimum identity was seen in the 27 amino acid central linker region between Ca2+ binding domains 2 and 3, which had 10 substitutions. The sequence comparison shows that the overall structure of both the proteins is similar, but the two may perform different functions due to variations in the central linker. The nucleotide sequences upstream and downstream of the ORF of EhCaBP1 and EhCaBP2 showed no significant sequence identity (Fig. 1A). In addition, genes present in the vicinity of each EhCaBP were different. The putative ORF located upstream of EhCaBP1 was the human homolog of AMP-deaminase (Score = 72, p = 2e-12) whereas the ORF upstream of EhCaBP2 had similarity to myosin heavy chain (Score = 56, p = 3e-7). Therefore, these two EhCaBP genes are unlikely to be allelic copies. Currently, genomic sequences from different species of Entamoeba are being deposited in the GSS databases maintained at the Sanger Centre. The putative coding regions of several EhCaBP-like sequences were identified from this data base using standard bioinformatics tools. A CaM-like protein displaying 50-78% identity to other calmodulins was also identified in this data base (contig 5693). A phylogenetic analysis of the EhCaBPs and related orthologs and paralogs and different calmodulins revealed that all Entamoeba CaBPs are distinctly different from CaMs including that from E. histolytica (Fig. 2). A close examination of the tree revealed minor differences among the CaBPs from different Entamoeba species. Among the Entamoeba CaBP orthologs, E. invadens displayed the maximum divergence. None of the EhCaBP-like Entamoeba CaBPs is close to CaM as the two segregate out in different clusters. The groupings were well supported by high bootstrap values. Interestingly, none of the sequences were found more than once in the data base, which may imply all of these isoforms may not be duplicated pseudogenes. From this analysis, it appears that EhCaBP1 and EhCaBP2 are paralogs of each other as they branched out separately. To determine the copy number of EhCaBP2, E. histolytica genomic DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes BglII and EcoRI. From the nucleotide sequence of EhCaBP2, it was determined that BglII does not have a site in the coding region whereas EcoRI has a single site. Genomic DNA digested with these enzymes was blotted and hybridized with EhCaBP2 probe. The EcoRI-digested DNA hybridized to two bands of sizes 6.0 kb and 4.36 kb while BglII-digested DNA hybridized with a single band of 4.36 kb (Fig 3B). Under the conditions of hybridization, the EhCaBP2 coding region probe specifically hybridized to EhCaBP2 DNA and not EhCaBP1 DNA (Fig. 3C). The sizes of bands obtained by Southern hybridization matched very well with the expected sizes from nucleotide sequence of the 18-kb TIGR contig 318109, which contains the EhCaBP2 ORF (Fig. 3A). The Southern data show that EhCaBP2 is a single copy gene. Expression of EhCaBP2 was checked in order to rule out the possibility that it could be a pseudogene. A search of the data base revealed an EST (accession no. AB002775) with 100% identity with EhCaBP2 at the nucleotide level, suggesting that this gene may be expressed in E. histolytica trophozoites (40Tanaka T. Tanaka M. Mitsui Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The presence of EhCaBP2 transcript was confirmed using both RT-PCR and Northern hybridization. EhCaBP2-specific primers were designed from the regions that showed maximum variability with respect to EhCaBP1 (marked in Fig 4A, top panel). The specificity of the primers was checked by a PCR reaction using cloned EhCaBP1 and EhCaBP2 genes as templates (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). A band of 225 bp was detected after RT-PCR of RNA isolated from axenic trophozoites (Fig. 4A, lane 3). In the absence of reverse transcriptase (Fig. 4A, lane 4), no such amplification was detected, showing the absence of any contaminating DNA. In addition, Northern hybridization of total HM1:IMSS RNA, carried out at high stringency as described under “Experimental Procedures,” revealed a single species of RNA transcript of 0.57 kb (Fig. 4B). Under the conditions used, the EhCaBP2 probe did not hybridize with EhCaBP1 (Fig. 4B, inset a). The data indicate that EhCaBP2 is expressed in E. histolytica. The EhCaBP2 ORF (402 bp) from strain HM-1:IMSS was amplified using primers 1-2 designed from the GSS entry AZ542766. The PCR-amplified product was cloned into the expression vector pET30a as described under “Experimenta"

That is, it is not detected in normal mouse skin, however, a significant increase in expression is detected in the skin of TPA promotion-sensitive strains of mice after TPA treatment. In this study, we found TPA-induced 8<i>S</i>-LOX mRNA expression is a result of increased transcription in SSIN primary keratinocytes and further investigated transcriptional regulation of 8<i>S</i>-LOX expression by cloning its promoter. The cloned 8<i>S</i>-LOX promoter (∼2 kb) in which a transcription initiation site was mapped at –27 from the ATG has neither a TATA box nor a CCAAT box. However, the promoter was highly responsive to TPA in TPA promotion-sensitive SSIN but not in TPA promotion-resistant C57BL/6J primary keratinocytes. We then identified a Sp1 binding site located –77 to –68 from the ATG that is a TPA-responsive element (TRE) of the promoter and that Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 proteins bind to the TRE. We also found that the binding of these proteins to the TRE was significantly increased by TPA treatment and inhibition of the binding by mithramycin A decreased TPA-induced promoter activity as well as 8<i>S</i>-LOX mRNA expression. These data suggest that increased binding of Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 to the TRE of the 8<i>S</i>-LOX promoter is a mechanism by which TPA induces 8<i>S</i>-LOX expression in keratinocytes."
