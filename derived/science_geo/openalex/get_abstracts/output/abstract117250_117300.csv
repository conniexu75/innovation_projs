https://openalex.org/W2055360422,"Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MT-MMP-1) has been proposed to play a critical role in regulating the expression of tissue-invasive phenotypes in normal and neoplastic cells by directly or indirectly mediating the activation of progelatinase A. To begin characterizing MT-MMP-1 structure-function relationships, transmembrane-deletion mutants were constructed, and the processing of the zymogens as well as the enzymic activity of the mature proteinases was analyzed. We now demonstrate that pro-MT-MMP-1 mutants are efficiently processed to active proteinases following post-translational endoproteolysis immediately downstream of an Arg-Arg-Lys-Arg basic motif by a proprotein convertase-dependent pathway. The secreted form of active MT-MMP-1 not only displays an N terminus identical with that described for the processed wild-type enzyme at Tyr (Strongin, A. Y., Collier, I., Bannikov, G., Marmer, B. L., Grants, G. A., and Goldberg, G. I.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 5331-5338), but also directly mediated progelatinase A activation via a two-step proteolytic cascade indistinguishable from that observed with intact cells. Furthermore, although the only function previously ascribed to MT-MMP-1 is its ability to act as a progelatinase A activator, purified transmembrane deletion mutants also expressed proteolytic activities against a wide range of extracellular matrix molecules. Given recent reports that MT-MMP-1 ectodomains may undergo intercellular transfer in vivo (Okada, A., Bellocq, J.-P., Rouyer, N., Chenard, M.-P., Rio, M.-C., Chambon, P., and Basset, P.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 2730-2734), our data suggest that soluble forms of the proteinase confer recipient cells with the ability to not only process progelatinase A, but also directly degrade extracellular matrix components.

Very recently, three new members of this family were discovered by screening cDNA libraries for homologies to conserved regions of the known MMP genes and named the membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases-1, −2, and −3 (MT-MMP-1, −2, and −3; (4.Sato H.

Based on their predicted amino acid sequences, each of the MT-MMPs, like almost all previously characterized MMPs, contains (i) a candidate leader sequence, (ii) a propeptide region which includes a highly conserved PRCGXPD sequence that helps stabilize the MMP zymogen in a catalytically inactive state, (iii) a zinc-binding catalytic domain, and (iv) a hemopexin-like domain near their respective C termini(4.Sato H.

In addition, in a pattern similar to that described for stromelysin-3, each of the MT-MMPs contains a short amino acid insert sandwiched between their pro- and catalytic domains that encodes a potential recognition motif for members of the proprotein convertase family(4.Sato H.

Despite their considerable similarity to other MMP family members, 2All MT-MMPs also contain a homologous 8-amino acid insert within their catalytic domains whose function remains undefined(4.Sato H.

Although little is known with regard to the potential functions of the MT-MMPs, most attention has focused on the ability of MT-MMP-1 as well as MT-MMP-3 to induce the processing of the MMP zymogen, progelatinase A, to its activated form (i.e. [Tyr]gelatinase A) via a [Leu]gelatinase A intermediate(4.Sato H.

Given the ability of activated gelatinase A to cleave a wide range of ECM substrates (including native types I, IV, V, VII, and XI collagen, denatured collagens, elastin, proteoglycans, laminin, and fibronectin) as well as the association of gelatinase A activation with the expression of tissue-invasive phenotypes(1.Woessner Jr., J.F.

Pepper M.S. Nature. 1994; 370: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the processes that regulate the activation of the MT-MMP zymogens themselves to mature forms remain undefined as does the mechanism by which MT-MMPs mediate progelatinase A activation(4.Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar, 5.Will H. Hinzmann B. Eur. J.

In large part, further progress in characterizing MT-MMP activities has been hindered by the technical problems associated with isolating and purifying membrane-associated molecules. Given that similar difficulties with other transmembrane enzymes have been negotiated by generating TM-deleted soluble mutants (17.Brenner C. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 18.Bravo D.A. Gleason J.B. Sanchez R.I. Roth R.A. Fuller R.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8712-8722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we noted that, with the exception of the extended C-terminal domain, the modular organization of the MT-MMPs is identical with that of the secreted MMPs(7.Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). Hence, two TM-deletion mutants of MT-MMP-1 were constructed by either truncating the molecule (i) immediately upstream of the start site of the TM domain (i.e. MT-MMP-1; herein referred to as MT-MMP-1) or (ii) at the conserved cysteinyl residue found at, or near, the terminus of all hemopexin domain-containing MMPs (i.e. MT-MMP-1 or MT-MMP-1). Utilizing these constructs, we now demonstrate that TM-deleted MT-MMP-1 (ΔMT-MMP-1) mutants undergo efficient post-translational endoproteolysis between Arg-Tyr by a proprotein convertase-dependent pathway to generate fully active proteinases. Furthermore, the purified ΔMT-MMP-1 mutants not only activate recombinant progelatinase A directly via a two-step activation cascade identical with that described for the membrane-associated enzyme, but they also express heretofore unsuspected ECM-degrading activities. COS-7 cells and MDCK cells (both obtained from ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 4 mML-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin as described(8.Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 20.Pei D. Majmuder G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with purified plasmid DNA by LipofectAMINE treatment (Life Technologies Inc.). MDCK clones stably expressing MT-MMP-1 were established by transfection and subsequently selected with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously(8.Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 20.Pei D. Majmuder G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following screening of an HT-1080 cDNA library constructed in the pBK-CMV vector with a 0.45-kilobase canine MT-MMP-1 cDNA isolated from an MDCK cDNA library, 3D. Pei and S. J. Weiss, unpublished observation.a human clone was obtained and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence of full-length HT-1080 MT-MMP-1 was identical with that described by Okada et al.(13.Okada A. Bellocq J.-P. Rouyer N. Chenard M.-P. Rio M.-C. Chambon P. Basset P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2730-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). To generate pro-MT-MMP-1 and pro-MT-MMP-1, a 5′ primer (ACCATGTCTCCCGCCCCAAGACCCTCCCGT) was paired with the 3′ primers, TTCAGCTCACCGCCCCGCCGCC or TTCAGAAGAAGAAGACTGCAAGGCC, respectively, in separate PCR reactions to generate cDNA fragments with the intended truncations at the C terminus (i.e. immediately prior to the TM domain as defined by Cao et al.(9.Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) at Ser or at the conserved Cys residue at position 508(6.Takino T.

Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar); see Fig. 1A). The PCR fragments were then cloned into pCR3-Uni vector (Invitrogen) and characterized by sequencing as described(8.Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for α-proteinase inhibitor (αPI), the Pittsburgh mutant of αPI (αPI), and a TM-deletion mutant of furin were provided by A. Rehemtulla and R. Kaufman (University of Michigan). Sequential PCR-based mutagenesis was performed as described previously, and the mutagenized fragments were cloned into pCR3-Uni vector and characterized by sequencing(8.Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers used are as follows: ATCAAGGCCAATGTTGCAAGGAAGCGCTACGCC for R108A, GCCAATGTTCGAAGGGCGCGCTACGCCATCCAG for K110A, AATGTTCGAAGGAAGGCCTACGCCATCCAGGGT for R111A, and GTTCGAAGGAAGC GCTTTGCCATCCAGGGTCTC for Y112F (bold nucleotides indicate the altered codons). MT-MMP-1 expression constructs as well as those harboring the above mutations (1 μg each) were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells (2 × 105/ml) by LipofectAMINE treatment, and, after a 24-h incubation, an aliquot of the cell-free supernatant (0.02 ml) was analyzed by Western blotting as described below. MDCK cells stably expressing MT-MMP-1 were incubated in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with the synthetic MMP inhibitor, BB-94 (0.5 μM, British Biotechnology; (21.Davies B. Brown P.Q. East N. Crimmin M.J. Balkwill E.R. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2087-2091PubMed Google Scholar)), to trap the active form of the proteinase as a reversible enzyme-inhibitor complex(20.Pei D. Majmuder G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 48 h, 2 liters of conditioned media were collected, dialyzed against buffer A (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl), and then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (1.5 × 10 cm). Bound material was eluted with a NaCl gradient (0 to 1 M), and fractions containing MT-MMP-1 (identified by Western blotting) were combined and dialyzed against buffer A. A heparin-Sepharose column (1 × 10 cm) was then loaded with the dialyzed materials and developed with a NaCl gradient (0 to 1 M). Positive fractions were pooled and passed through a gelatin-Sepharose column (1 × 5 cm) followed by gel filtration chromatography (Ultrogel ACA44, 1 × 150 cm) in the absence of BB-94 to regenerate the active proteinase. In selected experiments, MT-MMP-1 was purified from a batch culture of transiently transfected MDCK cells as described above. Basic protocols for these techniques have been described(8.Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 20.Pei D. Majmuder G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MT-MMP antisera were raised in New Zealand rabbit using a bacterially generated recombinant fusion protein between glutathione transferase and MT-MMP(20.Pei D. Majmuder G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme assays of MT-MMP-1 and MT-MMP-1 were performed in buffer A supplemented with 150 mM NaCl at 37°C unless noted otherwise. Matrix substrates (devoid of contaminating progelatinase A activity as determined by gelatin zymography; data not shown) were obtained from Collaborative Research (type I, IV, and V collagens, fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, and dermatan sulfate proteoglycan). Processing of pro-MT-MMP-1 by purified soluble furin (specific activity 500 units/μg; (18.Bravo D.A. Gleason J.B. Sanchez R.I. Roth R.A. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25830-25837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was performed as described(8.Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Recombinant progelatinase A (purified as described in (22.Fridman R. Fuerst T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D. Liotta L. Berman M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol.

Fridman (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI), recombinant human TIMP-2 was supplied by Amgen, and soluble human furin was provided by R. Fuller, University of Michigan. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with either MT-MMP-1 or MT-MMP-1 cDNA each secreted a pair of major and minor products that were specifically recognized by polyclonal antibodies to a truncated form of the bacterially expressed protein (Fig. 1B). While the molecular mass of the minor secreted proteins (64 kDa for MT-MMP-1 and 60 kDa for MT-MMP-1; lanes 2 and 3, respectively) were consistent with those of the predicted proforms of the metalloproteinases, the major soluble species detected with either TM-deletion mutant was a fragment 10 kDa smaller in size. The generation of the major and minor forms was not specific to COS-7 cells since a similar profile was generated with transfected MDCK cells.3 As expected, when cells were transiently transfected with wild-type MT-MMP-1, soluble forms of the enzyme were not detected in the conditioned media (Fig. 1B). In intact cell systems, MMPs can be recovered in conditioned medium as a mixture of zymogens, processed active enzymes, zymogen-inhibitor complexes, or enzyme-inhibitor complexes(1.Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-21549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3091) Google Scholar, 2.Matrisian L.M. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 3.Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). In the case of almost all MMP family members, many of these forms can be detected following SDS-PAGE in substrate-impregnated gels(1.Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-21549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3091) Google Scholar, 2.Matrisian L.M. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 3.Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). Thus, serum-free conditioned media from control, MT-MMP-1, MT-MMP-1, or MT-MMP-1 transfected cells were depleted of endogenous gelatinases by gelatin affinity chromatography (ΔMT-MMP-1 does not bind to gelatin; see below) and electrophoresed in gelatin- containing gels. Proteinases were then allowed to renature following the removal of SDS and then incubated overnight at 37°C. As shown in Fig. 1C, supernatants recovered from MT-MMP-1- or MT-MMP-1-transfected cells each revealed the presence of a single band of gelatinolytic activity whose relative mobility matched that of the major form of ΔMT-MMP-1 detected by Western blotting. Significantly, identical results were obtained when zymograms were performed with either β-casein- or κ-elastin-impregnated gels as well (data not shown). Regardless of substrate used, the band of proteolytic activity attributed to either ΔMT-MMP-1 mutant was completely inhibited when zymograms were performed in the presence of the MMP-specific inhibitor, BB-94 (Fig. 1C). Because both MT-MMP-1 and MT-MMP-1 appeared to undergo a similar, if not identical, processing event to generate active proteinases as assessed by zymography, one of the mutants (i.e. MT-MMP-1) was stably expressed in the MDCK cell line for further analyses. As shown in Fig. 2, serum-free conditioned media from stable transfectants expressing MT-MMP-1 were subjected to a combination of gelatin-Sepharose affinity, Q-Sepharose affinity, and heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. Utilizing this protocol, a single immunoreactive 50-kDa species was isolated that co-migrated with the band of activity detected by gelatin-zymography (Fig. 2C). Following 10 cycles of N-terminal sequence analysis, the material was identified as MT-MMP-1 with a single start site at Tyr (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, this N terminus not only aligns with that of the active forms of all other MMPs(6.Takino T. Sato H. Shinagawa A. Seiki M. J. Biol.

Thus, while almost all MMPs are synthesized and secreted as inactive zymogens, MT-MMP-1 (as well as MT-MMP-1; see below) underwent further processing to its active form. Like stromelysin-3, the only other membrane of the MMP family to be secreted as a fully processed active proteinase, MT-MMP-1 contains a motif of basic amino acids (i.e.RRKR) immediately upstream of its catalytic domain (see Fig. 3A; (4.Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar) and (8.Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar)). Recently, the RXKR array in stromelysin-3 (X = nonbasic amino acid) was shown to act as an endoproteolytic processing signal for an intracellular serine proteinase belonging to the proprotein convertase family(8.Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Because specific proprotein convertases can display varying requirements for basic residues at positions −1, −2, and −4 relative to the scissile bond (i.e. P, P, and P, respectively; (23.Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and (24.Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Day R. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar)), a potential role for this enzyme class in ΔMT-MMP-1 processing was initially assessed by successively substituting each basic residue with an Ala moiety in transient transfection assays. As shown in Fig. 3B, each of these substitutions almost completely blocked MT-MMP-1 processing (lanes 2-4). In contrast, a Tyr Ala substitution at the less critical P site (23.Watanabe T. Murakami K. Nakayama K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) did not affect MT-MMP-1 processing (Fig. 3, lane 5). Given that COS are known to express only two members of the proprotein convertase family that recognize RXKR motifs (i.e. furin and PACE4; (24.Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Day R. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar)), cells were co-transfected with MT-MMP-1 and the Pittsburgh mutant of αPI (αPI), a reactive site variant that inhibits furin (but not PACE4) activity in situ(25.Rehemtulla A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2349-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Wasley C.L. Rehemtulla A. Bristol J.A. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8458-8465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, αPI completely blocked MT-MMP-1 processing while wild-type αPI exerted no inhibitory effect (Fig. 3C). MT-MMP-1 processing was similarly inhibited by αPI in MDCK cells (data not shown). These results (together with the demonstration that soluble furin processes pro-ΔMT-MMP-1 to its active form under cell-free conditions; see below) indicate that pro-ΔMT-MMP-1 maturation is regulated by a furin-dependent pathway in an intact cell system. Current evidence indicates that MT-MMP-1-expressing cells initiate progelatinase A activation via a two-step process that involves an initial cleavage of the Asn-Leu bond followed by an autocatalytic conversion of the Leu intermediate into a 62-kDa active enzyme with an N-terminal Tyr residue(10.Strongin A.Y.

Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the ability of MT-MMP to directly cleave progelatinase A is unclear, and it has been postulated that additional intermediates may be involved(9.Cao J. Sato H. Takino T. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 801-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 10.Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grants G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol.

Thus, purified active MT-MMP-1 was incubated with recombinant progelatinase A and processing monitored by gelatin zymography and N-terminal sequence analysis. Following a 2-h incubation at 37°C, MT-MMP-1 initially cleaved progelatinase A (which migrates as a 68-kDa species) into a 64-kDa fragment (Fig. 4A). N-terminal sequence analysis of the 64-kDa gelatinase A fragment yielded the Leu form of the enzyme (Fig. 4A). Subsequently, the 64-kDa form of the enzyme underwent further processing to a 62-kDa product whose N terminus confirmed the generation of [Tyr]gelatinase A (Fig. 4A). As expected, the ability of MT-MMP-1 (as well as MT-MMP-1; data not shown) to activate progelatinase A was completely blocked by the addition of the MMP inhibitor, TIMP-2 (Fig. 4A) or BB-94 (data not shown). Interestingly, while earlier studies have demonstrated that"

Early studies identified a large polypeptide (previously called p350) that was associated with DNA-PK activity(2.Carter T. Vancurová I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell.

Interestingly, the cDNA sequence of DNA-PKcs reveals a novel catalytic domain with homology to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family rather than serine/threonine kinases(4.Hartley K.O. Gell D.

During our preliminary purification of DNA-PK, several other polypeptides appeared to copurify with activity and were phosphorylated in a DNA-dependent manner, including polypeptides of approximately 70 and 80 kDa that were identified as the Ku autoantigen(3.Lees-Miller S.P.

DNA-PK may also play a role in regulating the transcription of ribosomal genes by modulating the activity of RNA polymerase I (34.Hoff C.M. Ghosh A.K. Prabhakar B.S. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition to its role as the DNA targeting subunit of DNA-PK, Ku may also function as a helicase (37.Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.W. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6354-6357Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, relatively little is known about the regulation of DNA-PK activity. Previously, preparations highly enriched for DNA-PKcs (p350) were shown to lose activity following incubation with ATP and DNA(2.Carter T. Vancurová I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), suggesting that DNA-PK was inactivated by autophosphorylation. In addition, we showed that Ku copurified with DNA-PK activity and that DNA-PKcs and both subunits of Ku were phosphorylated in a DNA-dependent manner(3.Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Now that Ku is known to be the DNA targeting component of DNA-PK, we have studied the effects of autophosphorylation on DNA-PK activity using highly purified proteins. Our results suggest that inactivation correlates with autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs and disruption of the DNA-PK complex. The DNA-PKcs and Ku subunits of DNA-PK were purified from human placenta as described(39.Chan, D. W., Mody, C. H., Ting, N. S. Y., Lees-Miller, S. P. (1995) Biochem.

Reactions were at 30°C for 5-10 min and DNA-PK activity was calculated as nmol of phosphate incorporated into the peptide substrate per minute per milligram of protein. Synthetic peptides were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography purified by the Alberta Peptide Institute (Edmonton, Alberta). Purified DNA-PKcs and Ku proteins were preincubated at 30°C as described for activity assays, except that synthetic peptide was not present. Radiolabeled or unlabeled ATP or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP (Boehringer Mannheim) were present where indicated at 0.25 mM. After 0-10 min, aliquots were removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In order to reassay samples for remaining kinase activity, aliquots corresponding to 5-10% (v/v), or as indicated, of the preincubation reaction was removed and reassayed under standard kinase assay conditions with a full complement of synthetic peptide, DNA, and radiolabeled ATP as described above. For “add-back” experiments, aliquots from preincubation reactions containing autophosphorylated DNA-PK were removed and reassayed as above but with the addition of purified DNA-PKcs and/or Ku as described in the legend of Fig. 2. DNA-PK complex was phosphorylated as described above, trichloroacetic acid precipitated, and hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl for 1 h at 110°C. Samples were analyzed as described(40.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P.

DNA-PKcs (0.0375 μg/μl) and Ku (0.0125 μg/μl) were preincubated under phosphorylating conditions at 30°C in the presence of DNA and Mg-ATP as described. At 0, 2, and 5 min, 5-μl aliquots were removed and either added to an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer or reassayed for DNA-PK activity as described above. Samples for electrophoresis were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8% acrylamide/0.1% bisacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose as described (39.Chan, D. W., Mody, C. H., Ting, N. S. Y., Lees-Miller, S. P. (1995) Biochem. Cell Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar) except that transfer buffer did not contain SDS. Blotted proteins were renatured as described (41.Allaway G.P. Vivino A.A. Kohn L.D. Notkins A.L. Prabhakar B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and probed with a 40-base pair DNA probe (approximately 100 ng of DNA) previously end-labeled with [-P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (specific activity, approximately 150,000 cpm/ng DNA). The 40-base pair oligonucleotide was derived by digestion of plasmid pGEM 7Zf DNA with HaeIII and supports binding of DNA-PKcs and Ku in gel mobility shift assays. 2D. W. Chan and S. P. Lees-Miller, unpublished data. Samples for immunoprecipitation contained 1.5 μg of purified DNA-PKcs and/or 0.5 μg of purified Ku in standard assay buffers containing 10 μg/ml calf thymus DNA, 0.25 mM ATP or AMP-PNP as indicated. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, samples were placed on ice and an equal volume of immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) was added. Samples were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) followed by the addition of 1-5 μl of either a rabbit polyclonal antibody to DNA-PKcs (DPK1) or a mouse polyclonal antibody to Ku (Ab24). After incubation at 4°C for 2 h, immunocomplexes were precipitated by the addition of protein A-Sepharose, washed four times each with 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot as described above. The catalytic subunit and the DNA-binding component of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs and Ku p70/p80 dimer, respectively) are easily separated during purification under mild chromatographic conditions, hence early extracts of DNA-PK contained predominantly DNA-PKcs (previously called p350) with trace amounts of Ku(2.Carter T. Vancurová I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 3.Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Preincubation of these extracts with ATP and DNA resulted in loss of DNA-PK activity, suggesting that DNA-dependent phosphorylation of DNA-PK results in inactivation(2.Carter T. Vancurová I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 3.Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of DNA-PKcs and Ku in the active DNA-PK complex has not been determined; however, maximum kinase activity toward synthetic peptide substrates requires molar ratios (DNA-PKcs to Ku) of 1:1.3 to 1:1.5(7.Morozov V.E. Falzon M. Anderson C.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16684-16688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Chan, D. W., Mody, C. H., Ting, N. S. Y., Lees-Miller, S. P. (1995) Biochem. Cell Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Therefore, we first examined the effect of different molar ratios of DNA-PKcs to Ku on the inactivation of DNA-PK in the presence of ATP and DNA. DNA-PKcs and Ku were purified to homogeneity from human placenta (39.Chan, D. W., Mody, C. H., Ting, N. S. Y., Lees-Miller, S. P. (1995) Biochem. Cell Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar) and incubated at molar ratios of 2:1, 1:1, 1:2.5, and 1:5 (DNA-PKcs to Ku) in the presence of ATP, magnesium, and sonicated calf thymus DNA (as described under “Materials and Methods”). Molar ratios were calculated using molecular masses of 450 and 156 kDa for DNA-PKcs and the Ku dimer, respectively. After preincubation for 10 min, aliquots (corresponding to 10% (v/v) of each reaction) were removed and reassayed for kinase activity under standard assay conditions in the presence of the synthetic peptide PESQEAFADLWKK, DNA, and [-P]ATP as described. Regardless of the molar ratio of DNA-PKcs to Ku, preincubation with ATP and DNA resulted in the loss of 60-80% of the original DNA-PK activity (Table 1). In all subsequent experiments a molar ratio of 1:1 was employed; however, identical results were obtained using a molar ratio of 1:5 (DNA-PKcs to Ku).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In order to determine whether inactivation of DNA-PK required ATP hydrolysis, purified DNA-PKcs and Ku were preincubated with DNA in the presence of ATP or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP, and at timed intervals aliquots were removed and reassayed for kinase activity as described. DNA-PK activity was rapidly lost after incubation with DNA and ATP but not after preincubation with DNA alone, DNA plus AMP-PNP (Fig. 1A), or ATP alone (data not shown), strongly suggesting that DNA-dependent phosphorylation is required for kinase inactivation. In order to correlate inactivation with phosphorylation of individual DNA-PK proteins, an experiment was performed in parallel using radiolabeled ATP in the preincubation reaction. Aliquots were removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography. DNA-dependent inactivation of DNA-PK was shown to correlate with autophosphorylation of all three subunits of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs, Ku p70, and Ku p80) (Fig. 1B). Individually, neither DNA-PKcs nor Ku has significant kinase activity (5.Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 6.Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 39.Chan, D. W., Mody, C. H., Ting, N. S. Y., Lees-Miller, S. P. (1995) Biochem. Cell Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar), and DNA-PK activity requires assembly of DNA-PKcs onto DNA-bound Ku(42.Suwa A. Hirakata M. Takeda Y. Jesch S.A. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6904-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To determine whether inactivation of DNA-PK was due to autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs or the Ku component of DNA-PK, purified DNA-PKcs or Ku were added back to autophosphorylation reactions containing inactivated DNA-PK as described under “Materials and Methods.” If phosphorylation resulted in inactivation of only one protein component of DNA-PK, then we should be able to restore activity by adding the unphosphorylated component back to the inactivated complex. In contrast, if both protein components were inactivated by phosphorylation, both DNA-PKcs and Ku would be required to restore kinase activity. DNA-PK complex (DNA-PKcs and Ku) was incubated with ATP and DNA as described for Fig. 1, and after 10 min, aliquots were removed and assayed for kinase activity in the presence of DNA, synthetic peptide substrate, and either purified DNA-PKcs alone or Ku alone. As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of purified DNA-PKcs restored DNA-PK activity (lane 6), whereas addition of Ku did not (lane 5), suggesting that kinase inactivation results from autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs and not Ku. These data also suggest that autophosphorylated Ku is functional and capable of supporting kinase activity. The mechanism by which Ku binds to DNA is not known; however, Southwestern analysis suggests that the 70-kDa subunit of Ku (Ku p70) can interact directly with DNA(41.Allaway G.P. Vivino A.A. Kohn L.D. Notkins A.L. Prabhakar B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We therefore used this assay to determine whether autophosphorylated Ku retains its ability to interact with DNA. DNA-PK complex (molar ratio of DNA-PKcs/Ku, 1:1) was incubated under phosphorylating conditions (ATP plus DNA), transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a 40-base pair radiolabeled DNA probe. In the experiment shown, incubation under phosphorylating conditions for 5 min resulted in loss of >80% of original DNA-PK activity. Southwestern analysis shows that Ku p70 interacts with DNA under conditions that promote DNA-dependent inactivation of DNA-PK (Fig. 3A). After autoradiography, the blot was stripped and reprobed with antibodies to Ku. During the phosphorylation reaction, we estimate that at least 70% of the Ku p80 polypeptide was shifted into a slower migrating form (Fig. 3B). This form of Ku p80 migrates coincidentally with P-labeled Ku p80 and is sensitive to treatment with alkaline phosphatase (data not shown), strongly suggesting that it represents the phosphorylated form of Ku p80. These data suggest that autophosphorylation of Ku does not affect its ability to interact with DNA. We next used co-immunoprecipitation experiments to determine whether autophosphorylation affects interactions between the DNA-PK proteins. In order to ensure that the presence of DNA did not affect the ability of our antibodies to immunoprecipitate the appropriate antigen, we first incubated DNA-PKcs or Ku alone under standard assay conditions in either the absence or the presence of DNA. Following immunoprecipitation with the respective antibodies, complexes were analyzed by Western immunoblot. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to DNA-PKcs (DPK1) immunoprecipitated DNA-PKcs in the presence or the absence of DNA (Fig. 4A). Similarly mouse polyclonal antibodies to Ku also recognized Ku in the presence or the absence of DNA (Fig. 4B). Next, DNA-PKcs and Ku were combined and incubated in the presence or the absence of DNA (with no added ATP), immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by Western blot as above. Antibodies to Ku co-immunoprecipitated DNA-PKcs only in the presence of DNA (Fig. 4C). Similarly, antibodies to DNA-PKcs co-immunoprecipitated Ku only in the presence of added DNA (Fig. 4D). These data are consistent with previous findings (42.Suwa A. Hirakata M. Takeda Y. Jesch S.A. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6904-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and strongly suggest that the DNA-PK holoenzyme only forms or is stabilized in the presence of DNA. Next, DNA-PKcs and Ku were combined and preincubated under either phosphorylating conditions (plus DNA and ATP) (Fig. 5, A-D, lanes 2) or nonphosphorylating conditions (plus DNA and the nonhydrolyzable analogue, AMP-PNP) (Fig. 5, A-D, lanes 3), and following immunoprecipitation, immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blot as above. In the first experiment, DNA-PK complex was immunoprecipitated using antibodies to Ku (Fig. 5, A and B), and immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies to DNA-PKcs (Fig. 5A) or Ku (Fig. 5B). Under nonphosphorylating conditions (in the presence of AMP-PNP and DNA), both DNA-PKcs and Ku were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 3); however, preincubation of DNA-PKcs and Ku under phosphorylating conditions resulted in a drastic reduction in DNA-PKcs that co-precipitated with antibodies to Ku (Fig. 5A, lane 2). Under phosphorylating conditions Ku p80 was present as a doublet (Fig. 5B, lane 2, arrow), consistent with our previous observation (Fig. 3) that phosphorylated Ku p80 has a slower migration on SDS-PAGE. Similar results were obtained using three different polyclonal antibodies to Ku. In reciprocal experiments, reactions containing DNA-PK complex, DNA, and ATP or AMP-PNP were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to DNA-PKcs. Western blots with DNA-PKcs showed that DNA-PKcs immunoprecipitated equally under phosphorylating or nonphosphorylating conditions (Fig. 5C, lanes 2 and 3), whereas the majority of the Ku was only immunoprecipitated by antibodies to DNA-PKcs in reactions carried out in the absence of phosphorylation (Fig. 5D, lanes 2 and 3). Therefore to summarize, under conditions that promoted DNA-dependent phosphorylation, DNA-PKcs did not co-immunoprecipitate with antibodies to Ku (Fig. 5A, lane 2), and Ku did not immunoprecipitate with antibodies to DNA-PKcs (Fig. 5D, lane 2), whereas under nonphosphorylating conditions (but in the presence of DNA) both antisera immunoprecipitated both proteins (Fig. 4, C and D, and Fig. 5, A-D, lane 3). These data suggest that autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs leads to disruption of the DNA-PKcs-Ku complex. Early studies suggested that phosphorylation-induced inactivation of DNA-PK was partially prevented by preincubation in the presence of a protein substrate (beta-casein), suggesting that inactivation of DNA-PK may only occur in the absence of a suitable substrate(3.Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This observation may be important in evaluating the possible biological relevance of autophosphorylation-induced inactivation of DNA-PK. We therefore preincubated DNA-PK complex with DNA, ATP, and either the synthetic peptide substrate (PESQEAFADLWKK) or a similar nonsubstrate peptide (PESEQAFADLWKK). At timed intervals, aliquots were removed and assayed under normal kinase conditions with fresh ATP, DNA, and substrate peptide. As shown in Fig. 6, DNA-dependent kinase activity was protected by inclusion of a substrate peptide in the preincubation mixture, whereas preincubation with the nonsubstrate peptide did not protect from inactivation. The presence of the nonsubstrate peptide at up to 125 μM did not inhibit the kinase reaction (data not shown and (22.Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar)). Recent evidence suggests that DNA-PK functions in DNA repair and transcription, yet relatively little is known about the regulation of DNA-PK activity and the interactions between the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs), the DNA-targeting subunit (Ku), and the DNA itself. Here we show that in the presence of DNA, DNA-PK undergoes rapid autophosphorylation of each of the three protein subunits and that autophosphorylation correlates with inactivation of DNA-PK kinase activity. Mock reactions containing DNA-PK plus DNA alone or DNA plus a nonhydrolyzable analogue of ATP did not result in inactivation. We also show using add-back experiments that purified DNA-PKcs but not Ku restored kinase activity, suggesting that the critical event in the inactivation of DNA-PK is phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs. The add-back experiments also suggest that autophosphorylated Ku retains its functional activity. Ku-DNA interactions are thought to be mediated by Ku p70(41.Allaway G.P. Vivino A.A. Kohn L.D. Notkins A.L. Prabhakar B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 43.Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used Southwestern immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated Ku and show that Ku p70 retains its ability to interact with DNA under conditions in which approximately 70% of the Ku is phosphorylated. Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs is responsible for phosphorylation-induced inactivation of DNA-PK. DNA-PKcs and Ku interact weakly if at all in solution, and the active complex is formed only in the presence of DNA(42.Suwa A. Hirakata M. Takeda Y. Jesch S.A. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6904-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We therefore used co-immunoprecipitation experiments in order to address whether phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs affects its ability to interact with DNA-bound Ku. We show, using a variety of antibodies, that under conditions that promote phosphorylation of DNA-PK proteins, the amount of DNA-PKcs that co-immunoprecipitates with Ku (in the presence of DNA), is drastically reduced. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that autophosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK results in disruption of the DNA-PK complex and that the Ku component retains activity and its ability to interact with DNA. In agreement with our previous results(3.Lees-Miller S.P. Chen Y.-R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), our data also suggest that inactivation of DNA-PK can be prevented by preincubation in the presence of a suitable substrate. However, our preliminary data indicate that neither the substrate nor the mutant peptide prevented phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs under our assay conditions.2 In many substrate proteins, DNA-PK phosphorylates serine or threonine residues that precede a glutamine(1.Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 283-314PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence of DNA-PKcs predicts 26 potential DNA-PK phosphorylation sites(4.Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), and the Ku subunits contain six potential phosphorylation sites(45.Chan J.Y.C. Lerman M.I. Prabhakar B.S. Isozaki O. Santisteban P. Kuppers R.C. Oates E.L. Notkins A.L. Kohn L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3651-3654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Mimori T. Ohosone Y. Hama N. Suwa A. Akizuki M. Homma M. Griffith A.J. Hardin J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Attempts to map these sites are in progress. Our preliminary data show that autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs occurs at multiple sites, any of which might be critical to kinase inactivation. What then might be the biological significance of inactivation of DNA-PK? Indeed, why should DNA-PK inactivate itself? It has been proposed that one of the functions of the DNA-PK complex is in the rejoining of DNA ends during V(D)J recombination (44.Roth D.B. Lindahl T. Gellert M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 496-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and DNA double strand break repair. According to this model, active DNA-PK assembles at or close to the recombination site where it interacts with and presumably phosphorylates other proteins involved in DNA repair and/or recombination. The large size of DNA-PKcs suggests that it might act as a scaffold for interaction with other proteins(4.Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Possible candidate proteins might include RAG 1, RAG 2, or nucleases or other proteins involved in V(D)J recombination or DNA double strand break repair. In addition, we and others have shown that DNA-PK preferentially phosphorylates DNA-bound substrates(22.Lees-Miller S.P. Sakaguchi K. Ullrich S. Appella E. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5041-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 23.Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 28.Anderson C.W. Connelly M.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Lintott L.G. Zhang H. Sipley J.A. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Atassi M.Z. Methods in Protein Structure Analysis. Plenum Press, New York1995: 395-406Crossref Google Scholar). We speculate that under certain conditions, perhaps in the absence of a suitable substrate, DNA-PK undergoes autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs and Ku proteins, leading to inactivation of DNA-PKcs and disruption of the DNA-PK complex. This could allow other proteins involved in DNA repair or V(D)J recombination to interact with the DNA breaks site or with other phosphorylated proteins, including perhaps DNA-bound phosphorylated Ku. Perhaps, therefore, one function of autophosphorylation is to make phosphorylated Ku more accessible to new protein partners. Alternatively, phosphorylation could affect some other property of Ku, for example helicase activity(37.Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.W. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zhang J. Wang S. Pongor S. Falaschi A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4991-5001Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Also phosphorylated DNA-PKcs, once liberated, might be free to pursue some other function in the cell. Interestingly, the cDNA sequence of DNA-PKcs reveals homology to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family. To date, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity has not been demonstrated for either DNA-PKcs or DNA-PK holoenzyme(4.Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C.M. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar); however, it is possible that autophosphorylation could affect phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity of DNA-PKcs alone or in combination with other proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2022495919,"p130 is a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that tightly binds v-Crk in v-crk-transformed cells and v-Src in v-src-transformed cells. The “substrate domain” of p130 contains 15 possible Src homology (SH) 2-binding motifs, most of which conform to the binding motif for the Crk SH2 domain. Another region near its C terminus contains possible binding motifs for the Src SH2 domain and proline-rich sequences that are candidates for SH3-binding sites. Using GST fusion proteins, we revealed that both SH2 and SH3 domains of Src bind p130, whereas v-Crk binds p130 through its SH2 domain. We located the binding site of p130 for the Src SH3 domain at the sequence RPLPSPP in the region near its C terminus. Mutations within this sequence or at Tyr of p130 caused a significant reduction in the association of p130 with Src, and no association was detected when both of them were deleted. The kinase activity in v-Crk-transformed cells was also associated with p130 through this region. On the other hand, the deletion of the substrate domain abolished the binding with v-Crk. The association through the C-terminal region of p130 with Src kinase may facilitate effective hyperphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the substrate domain of p130, resulting in the binding of SH2-containing molecules to p130."

Two of these primers amplified a 83-base pair fragment that was cyclase-like in sequence and that was employed as a hybridization probe to screen a cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA extracted from Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) stems. Twelve independent clones with insert size in excess of 2 kilobase pairs were isolated and partially sequenced. One of these cDNA isolates was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding a protein that was catalytically active in converting geranylgeranyl diphosphate to a diterpene olefin that was confirmed to be taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene by combined capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The sequence specifies an open reading frame of 2586 nucleotides, and the complete deduced polypeptide, including a long presumptive plastidial targeting peptide, contains 862 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 98,303, compared with about 79,000 previously determined for the mature native enzyme. Sequence comparisons with monoterpene, sesquiterpene, and diterpene cyclases of plant origin indicate a significant degree of similarity between these enzymes; the taxadiene synthase most closely resembles (46% identity, 67% similarity) abietadiene synthase, a diterpene cyclase from grand fir."
https://openalex.org/W2070567048,"F-isoprostanes are free radical-catalyzed products of arachidonic acid. One of these compounds, 8-epiprostaglandin F (8-epi-PGF), is a mitogen and vasoconstrictor. We have shown that 8-epi-PGF, unlike other F-isoprostanes, is a minor product of the prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1 (PG G/H S-1) expressed in human platelets (Praticó, D., Lawson, J. A., and FitzGerald, G. A.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 9800-9808). Human monocytes express PG G/H S-1 constitutively and exhibit regulated expression of PG G/H S-2. Induction of PG G/H S-2 by concanavalin A, the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide was confirmed with a specific antibody in monocytes pretreated with aspirin to inhibit PG G/H S-1. Induction of PG G/H S-2 by all three stimuli coincided with increased formation of prostaglandin E (PGE), thromboxane B (TxB), and 8-epi-PGF, but not of other F-isoprostanes. Confirmation of PG G/H S-2 as the source of 8-epi-PGF formation was obtained by down-regulating the enzyme with dexamethasone; preventing protein synthesis with cycloheximide; and preventing synthesis of PGE, TxB, and 8-epi-PGF with the specific PG G/H S-2 inhibitor, L 745,337.Monocytes also exhibit the facility to generate 8-epi-PGF in a free radical-dependent manner. Thus, stimulation with opsonized zymosan or coincubation with low density lipoprotein was unassociated with product formation. However, coincubation of low density lipoprotein with zymosan-stimulated human monocytes resulted in marked formation of 8-epi-PGF, but not of PGE or TxB. Production of 8-epi-PGF coincided with that of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and lipid hydroperoxides, but was unaccompanied by PG G/H S-2 induction. Pretreatment of monocytes with the antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene or with superoxide dismutase, but not with L 745,337, suppressed formation of 8-epi-PGF, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and lipid hydroperoxides.In conclusion, human monocytes may form bioactive 8-epi-PGF either via free radical- or enzyme-catalyzed pathways. 8-Epi-PGF is a more abundant product of monocyte PG G/H S-2 than of platelet PG G/H S-1.

Additional to its susceptibility to enzyme-catalyzed metabolism to biologically active compounds, arachidonic acid may be subject to free radical attack, leading to formation of prostaglandin isomers in situ in the cell membrane phospholipid(17.O'Connor D.E.

This study demonstrates that PG G/H S-2 may also form 8-epi-PGF. Interestingly, it is a more abundant product of this enzyme in monocytes than of the PG G/H S-1 isoform in platelets. Monocytes also retain the ability to form this compound in a free radical-catalyzed manner. Indeed, coincubation of monocytes with LDL results in a time-dependent formation of 8-epi-PGF, coincident with LDL oxidation. LPS derived from Escherichia coli 026:B6, dexamethasone, cycloheximide, aspirin, zymosan, concanavalin A, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), superoxide dismutase, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), leupeptin, Nonidet P-40, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and aprotinin were purchased from Sigma. Hanks' balanced salt solution, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, RPMI 1640 medium, fetal calf serum, L-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [4H]TxB and [4H]PGE were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co., Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI). The internal standard used for 8-epi-PGF was the 18O-labeled compound derived from authentic 8-epi-PGF (Cayman Chemical Co., Inc.) using the technique described by Pickett and Murphy(22.Pickett W.C. Murphy R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). L 745,337 was kindly donated by Dr. Ian W. Rodger (Merck Frosst Canada Inc., Dorval, Quebec, Canada). Mouse polyclonal antibodies against PG G/H S-1 were a gift from Dr. W. L. Smith (Michigan State University). Mouse polyclonal antibodies prepared against the sequence of the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 580-598) of human PG G/H S-2 (COOH-NASSSRSGLDDINPTVLLK) were obtained as described previously (23.Habib A. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. J. Maclouf (INSERM, Unité 348, Paris, France). Mononuclear cells were obtained from fresh peripheral blood of healthy volunteers, who did not take any medication during the previous 2 weeks. Blood was subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation as described by Boyum(24.Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21 (89): 97Google Scholar). The mononuclear cell layer was recovered and washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution. The cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% inactivated fetal calf serum and EDTA for 15 min at 37°C to remove platelets specifically adherent to the monocytes. They were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution and resuspended at 1 × 106 ml in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium supplemented with L-glutamine (220 mg/l) and antibiotics (streptomycin and penicillin). More than 94% of the cells were estimated to be viable based on trypan blue dye exclusion. The cells were plated in 24-well multiplates and maintained at 37°C in a temperature-controlled, humidified 95% air, 5% CO incubator. The nonadherent cells were removed by washing the plates twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline after 2 h of incubation, and the adherent cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium enriched with 5% inactivated fetal calf serum, L-glutamine, and antibiotics. The resultant harvested adherent cells routinely contained >92% monocytes as determined by morphology and staining for nonspecific esterase(25.Koski I.R. Poplack D.G. Blaese R.M. Bloom B.R. David J.R. In Vitro Methods in Cell-mediated and Tumor Immunity. Academic Press, New York1976: 359-362Google Scholar). The contribution of PG G/H S-1 activity to eicosanoid production in response to the different stimuli was suppressed by pretreating the blood with aspirin (10 μg/ml) in the sampling syringe and at time 0. This was confirmed by product analysis. Isolated monocytes were incubated for 1, 4, 8, and 24 h in the absence and presence of LPS (10 μg/ml), concanavalin A (10 μg/ml), or PMA (100 nM). Fresh medium containing 10 μM arachidonic acid was added at each time point after removing the incubation medium; the supernatants were harvested after 30 min. Concentrations of PGE, TxB, and 8-epi-PGF were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as described previously(21.Praticó D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26.Knapp H.R. Healy C. Lawson J. FitzGerald G.A. Thromb. Res. 1980; 50: 377-386Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The contribution of induced PG G/H S-2 to formation of these products was elucidated by use of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide(27.Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar); a specific inhibitor of this isoform of the enzyme, L 745,337(28.Chan C.C. Boyce S. Brideau C. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Gordon R. Guay D. Hill R.G. Li C.S. Mancini J. Penneton M. Prasit P. Rasori R. Riendeau D. Roy P. Tagari P. Vickers P. Wong E. Rodger I.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 1531-1537PubMed Google Scholar); or dexamethasone, which has previously been shown to down-regulate PG G/H S-2(29.O'Sullivan M.G. Huggins Jr., E.M. McCall C.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1294-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 30-m DB-1 capillary column was used for analysis of all products. The temperature program was 190-320°C at 20°C/min. The ions monitored were m/z 614 for TxB and m/z 618 for [2H]TxB, m/z 624 for PGE and m/z 628 for [2H]PGE, and m/z 695 for 8-epi-PGF and m/z 699 for 8-epi-[18O]PGF. LDL was prepared according to previously described methods that minimize oxidation and exposure to endotoxin(30.Cathcart M.K. Chisolm G.M. McNally A.K. Morel D.W. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1988; 24: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Each batch of LDL was assayed for endotoxin contamination by the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Final endotoxin contamination was always <0.02 unit/mg of LDL cholesterol. LDL was stored in 0.5 mM EDTA. Immediately before use, LDL was dialyzed at 4°C against phosphate-buffered saline without calcium or magnesium in the dark. LDL was used at final concentration of 0.40 mg of protein/ml. Human monocytes were washed with RPMI 1640 medium without serum, plated into 12-well tissue culture plates (1 × 106/ml/well), and co-cultured for 24 h with LDL at 0.40 mg of protein/ml in the presence or absence of opsonized zymosan (2 mg/ml) according to the method of Johnston(31.Johnston R.B. Adams D.O. Edelson P.J. Koren H. Methods for Studying Momonuclear Phagocytes. Academic Press, New York1981: 489-497Google Scholar). LDL was extracted by adding 2 volumes of Folch reagent (chloroform and methanol at a 2:1 ratio) and base-hydrolyzed (1.0 M KOH) before quantitation as described above to determine the total 8-epi-PGF level in the supernatant. Briefly, the presence of lipid oxidation products on LDL was detected spectrophotometrically by measuring the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) levels monitored at 532 nm(32.Iuliano L. Praticó D. Ghiselli L. Bonavita M.S. Violi F. Lipids. 1992; 27: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The lipid hydroperoxide levels were measured using the FOX 2 assay at 560 nm(33.Nourooz-Zadeh J. Taajaddini-Sarmandi J. Wolff S.P. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Isolated human monocytes were lysed in ice-cold buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The protein content was determined using a microbicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Twenty micrograms of total cell protein were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Acrylamide (8 and 4%) was used for the separating and staking gels, respectively. The resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were saturated overnight at 4°C with a solution of 5% fat-free dried milk in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with either mouse polyclonal anti-PG G/H S-2 antibody (1 μg/ml) or specific polyclonal anti-PG G/H S-1 antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at 1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature. Chemiluminescence substrates were used to reveal positive bands according to the manufacturer's instructions, and bands were visualized after exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Corp.). Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were made by using analysis of variance with subsequent application of Student's t test as appropriate. Incubation of human monocytes with 10 μg/ml LPS resulted in a time-dependent increase of prostaglandin production (Fig. 1). LPS did not significantly affect eicosanoid production at 1 h, but caused a statistically significant increase at 4, 8, and 24 h of incubation. Maximal stimulation of 8-epi-PGF, PGE, and TxB at 24 h of incubation was in the concentration ratio of 1:5.3:200. To evaluate whether LPS-induced production of these compounds was dependent on induction of PG G/H S-2, we studied the effects of dexamethasone (2 μM) and cycloheximide (5 μg/ml). Both compounds markedly suppressed the production of the three prostaglandins (Table 1), coincident with suppression of the immunoreactive 72-kDa doublet recognized by the monoclonal anti-PG G/H S-2 antibody on Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). The band recognized by the anti-PG G/H S-1 antibody was unaltered by LPS, cycloheximide, or dexamethasone (data not shown). Confirmation that product formation was dependent on PG G/H S-2 induction was indicated by the specific inhibition of that enzyme. L 745,337 dose-dependently suppressed PGE, 8-epi-PGF, and TxB with the same IC value (48 ± 10 nM). Unlike cycloheximide and dexamethasone, the effects of L 745,337 were not accompanied by down-regulation of PG G/H S-2 protein (data not shown). We observed a selective increase in a peak at m/z 695, comigrating with the 8-epi-PGF internal standard (m/z 699). It was unaccompanied by other peaks, presumably reflecting other F-isoprostanes, and it was suppressed by cycloheximide (Fig. 3). These data are consistent with enzyme- rather than free radical-catalyzed formation of 8-epi-PGF under these conditions.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2Western blot analysis of PG G/H S-2 protein expression in monocytes treated with LPS (10 μg/ml). Isolated human monocytes (1 × 106/ml) were incubated with saline for 24 h (control (c)); with LPS alone for 1, 4, 8, and 24 h; with LPS + dexamethasone (D) for 24 h; and with LPS + cycloheximide (C) for 24 h.

Both compounds caused a time-dependent increase on 8-epi-PGF, PGE, and TxB. The respective ratios of product formed at 24 h of incubation were 1:5.3:160 for concanavalin A (Fig. 4) and 1:5:130 for PMA (Fig. 5). Again, both concanavalin A (Fig. 6A) and PMA (Fig. 6B) caused induction of PG G/H S-2 protein, which was suppressed, together with product formation, by cycloheximide and dexamethasone (Table 2 and Table 3). L 745,337 suppressed formation of concanavalin A (IC = 40 ± 6 nM), and PMA (IC = 35 ± 8 nM) stimulated formation of 8-epi-PGF, along with that of the other eicosanoids. The induced PG G/H S-2 protein was again unaffected by L 745,337.Figure 5Time course of eicosanoid formation in human monocytes stimulated with PMA (100 nM).

Similarly, coincubation of monocytes with LDL, a source of substrate for lipid peroxidation(30.Cathcart M.K. Chisolm G.M. McNally A.K. Morel D.W. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1988; 24: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), did not induce release of any of these products into the supernatant. Moreover, no significant changes in the levels of TBARS or lipid hydroperoxides were observed in human monocytes incubated with LDL in the absence of zymosan. This is in agreement with previous observations that activation is required for monocytes to oxidize LDL(34.Cathcart M.K. McNally A.K. Morel D.W. Chisolm G.M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1963-1989PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of human monocytes with opsonized zymosan in the presence of LDL caused a marked time-dependent increase in 8-epi-PGF, but not in PGE or TxB. The increase in 8-epi-PGF was associated with an increase in TBARS and hydroperoxide levels (Table 4). This phenomenon was prevented by the oxygen free radical scavengers superoxide dismutase (300 units/ml) and BHT (20 μM), but not by L 745,337 (100 nM) (Fig. 7) or by the nonselective inhibitor of PG G/H S, aspirin (data not shown). The quantities of 8-epi-PGF formed under these conditions, in the presence of an excess of lipid (LDL) substrate, are not comparable with those formed in isolated stimulated human monocytes in the earlier experiments. In contrast to the data presented in Fig. 3, an array of peaks corresponding to F-isoprostanes was evident in the supernatants of zymosan-stimulated human monocytes incubated with LDL (Fig. 8, center panel). One of these corresponds to the retention time of the 8-epi-PGF standard (m/z 699) (Fig. 8, upper panel). Pretreatment with antioxidants suppressed the peaks, reflecting free radical-catalyzed isoprostane formation under these experimental conditions (Fig. 8, lower panel). The retention time of authentic PGF is well away from that of the F-isoprostanes. Finally, coincubation of zymosan-activated human monocytes with LDL did not result in induction of PG G/H S-2 protein (data not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 8Selected ion monitoring of 8-epi-PGF.

The array of peaks seen in the chromatogram most likely corresponds to F-isoprostanes. The lower panel shows the reduction of the peaks (m/z 695) when the sample was incubated with butylated hydroxytoluene supporting the free radical-catalyzed origin of them.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 8-Epi-PGF is an abundant isoprostane formed in response to free radical attack on arachidonic acid(17.O'Connor D.E. Mihelich E.D. Coleman M.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 3577-3584Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Urinary excretion of 8-epi-PGF is increased in syndromes putatively associated with increased oxidant stress in vivo, including paracetamol and paraquat poisoning(35.Delanty, N., Reilly, M., Lawson, J. A., Fitzgerald, D. J., FitzGerald, G. A. (1996) Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol., in pressGoogle Scholar), cigarette smoking (36.Reilly, M., Delanty, N., Lawson, J. A., FitzGerald, G. A. (1996) Circulation, in pressGoogle Scholar), and vascular reperfusion(37.Delanty, N., Reilly, M., Lawson, J. A., McCarthy, J., Fitzgerald, D. J., FitzGerald, G. A. (1996) Circulation, in pressGoogle Scholar). We have previously shown that it is a minor product of the PG G/H S-1 expressed in human platelets(21.Praticó D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9800-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, this route of formation appears to contribute trivially to overall 8-epi-PGF biosynthesis, even in a setting such as chronic cigarette smoking(36.Reilly, M., Delanty, N., Lawson, J. A., FitzGerald, G. A. (1996) Circulation, in pressGoogle Scholar), in which platelet activation (38.Nowak J. Murray J.J. Oates J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 1987; 76: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) is thought to coincide with increased oxidant stress. Human monocytes contain PG G/H S-2 additional to the isoform expressed in platelets. This form of the enzyme is highly regulated by cytokines, LPS, hormones, and mitogenic factors(9.Fu J.Y. Masferrer J.L. Seibert K. Raz A. Needleman P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16737-16740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Lee S.H. Soyoola E. Chanmugam P. Hart S. Sun W. Zhong H. Liou S.

Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. Dubois R.N. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1183-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary sequences of both human enzymes exhibit 60% similarity(8.Funk C.D. Funk L.B. Kennedy M.E. Pong A.S. FitzGerald G.A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9049-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, mutational analysis suggests that the active site of PG G/H S-2 is the more accommodating. For example, although aspirin is a relatively nondiscriminate PG G/H S inhibitor(42.Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Mitchell J.A. Akarasereenont P. Thiemermann C. Flower R.J. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 90: 11693-11697Crossref Scopus (1575) Google Scholar), inhibition of PG G/H S-2, but not of PG G/H S-1, by aspirin is associated with increased production of (15R)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, coincident with inhibition of prostanoid formation(44.Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that 8-epi-PGF may be formed in a PG G/H S-2-dependent manner. Using three independent stimuli, formation coincided in time with the kinetics of the de novo synthesis of PG G/H S-2. Furthermore, reduction in activity of the induced enzyme, by either cycloheximide or steroids, prevented 8-epi-PGF formation coincident with that of the conventional PG G/H S-2 products of these cells, PGE and thromboxane A. A selective PG G/H S-2 inhibitor suppressed generation of all three products without preventing synthesis of the enzyme. PG G/H S-1 was not induced during stimulation of 8-epi-PGF generation in these experiments; thus, the contribution of the two enzymes to its production is clearly segregated. Unlike the case with platelet PG G/H S-1, 8-epi-PGF is formed in greater abundance relative to the conventional products of PG G/H S-2 in monocytes. Thus, whereas maximal 8-epi-PGF formation in platelets is roughly that of TxB, maximal formation by PG G/H S-2 in monocytes is and of the corresponding production of PGE and TxB, respectively, the most abundant conventional products of PG G/H S-2 in these cells. This observation raises the possibility that the mitogenic properties of 8-epi-PGF(20.Fukunaga M. Makita N. Roberts L.J. Morrow L.D. Takahashi K. Badr K.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1619-C1624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may contribute to the role of PG G/H S-2 activation in syndromes of vascular proliferation(45.Maier J.A.M. Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10805-10808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46.Han J.W. Sadowski H. Young D.A. Macara I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3373-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Selective inhibitors of this enzyme might be used in clarifying the utility of urinary 8-epi-PGF as an index of free radical generation in syndromes putatively associated with oxidant stress, in which PG G/H S-2 induction is possible. Although enzyme-catalyzed formation seems to be a feature of 8-epi-PGF, but not of other F-isoprostanes, similar caution might be applied to estimates of “F-isoprostanes”(47.Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Frei B. Longmire A.W. Gaziano J.M. Lynch S.M. Shyr Y. Strauss W.E. Oates J.A. Roberts L.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar), of which 8-epi-PGF is an abundant constituent(48.Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Badr K.F. Roberts II, L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Monocytes are the first example of cells in which both enzyme- and free radical-catalyzed formation of 8-epi-PGF have been demonstrated. Activation of monocytes with zymosan, in contrast to LPS, concanavalin A, or PMA, fails to induce PG G/H S-2 expression or 8-epi-PGF generation. However, when coincubation with LDL affords the availability of an abundant lipid substrate, zymosan-activated monocytes catalyze the formation of a substantial amount of 8-epi-PGF. This occurs coincident with production of TBARS and hydroperoxides, both indices of lipid oxidation, but not with either induction of PG G/H S-2 or generation of either PGE or TxB. Under these circumstances, selective PG G/H S-2 inhibitors are ineffective in preventing 8-epi-PGF formation. Rather, antioxidants, such as superoxide dismutase or BHT, inhibit its production. Incubation of human monocytes with LDL in the absence of zymosan activation fails to stimulate 8-epi-PGF production. Previous work has demonstrated that copper-induced oxidation of LDL (49.Lynch S.M. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Frei B. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) is associated with increased 8-epi-PGF generation. Whether it or indeed other arachidonic acid products contribute to the role of monocytes and their cellular derivatives in the process of atherogenesis remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2145860725,"Expression of the A-type lamins was studied in the lung adenocarcinoma cell line GLC-A1. A-type lamins, consisting of lamin A and C, are two products arising from the same gene by alternative splicing. Northern blotting showed in GLC-A1 a relatively low expression level of lamin C and an even lower expression level of lamin A as compared to other adenocarcinoma cell lines. Immunofluorescence studies revealed highly irregular nuclear inclusions of lamin A, suggesting protein or gene expression abnormalities. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based cDNA analysis followed by sequencing indicated the presence of an as yet unidentified alternative splicing product of the lamin A/C gene. This product differs from lamin A by the absence of the 5' part of exon 10 (90 nucleotides). Therefore we propose to designate this product lamin Adelta10. Deletion of the 30 amino acids encoded by exon 10 was predicted to result in a shift in pI of the protein from 7.4 to approximately 8.6, which was confirmed by two-dimensional immunoblotting. mRNA analysis in a variety of cell lines, normal colon tissue as well as carcinomas demonstrated the presence of lamin Adelta 10 in all samples examined, suggesting its presence in a variety of cell types."

Metabolic steady state and pulse-chase labeling studies demonstrated a 2-h delay in the detection of cell-associated Aβ/Aβ in the medium, suggesting that Aβ is generated at a slow rate intracellularly prior to its secretion. Finally, as NT2N cells mature over time in culture, the secretion of Aβ and Aβ increases more than 5-fold over 7 weeks. This increase in the secretion of Aβ/Aβ in NT2N cells as a function of time may recapitulate a similar phenomenon in the aging brain.

These observations support the hypothesis that overproduction of Aβ or increased production of Aβ leads to familial AD. However, the exact mechanism that leads to the production and secretion of Aβ and Aβ and the identity of the α-, β-, and -secretase remains elusive. This is in part due to the fact that APP metabolism is cell type-specific, and overexpression of APP may affect its metabolism. For example, Aβ was detected associated with cell lysate as well as in the conditioned medium from cultured postmitotic CNS neuronal cells (NT2N) produced by the terminal differentiation of a teratocarcinoma cell line (NT2) with retinoic acid(26.Wertkin A.W.

To date, the cell types responsible for the production of Aβ that forms amyloid deposits in the AD brain are not known. Since Aβ deposits are found exclusively in the brain, and APP is found predominantly in neurons, it is reasonable to hypothesize that Aβ produced by human CNS neurons from APP is the likely source of β amyloid in senile plaques. Since NT2N cells resemble human CNS neurons(32.Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Pleasure S.J. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci.

In the present study, we demonstrated that Aβ is indeed produced intracellularly before secretion. We also showed increase secretion of Aβ and Aβ in NT2N cells as a function of time in culture. NT2 cells derived from a human embryonal carcinoma cell line (Ntera2/cl.D1) were grown and passaged twice weekly in Opti-Mem (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin as described previously(32.Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M-Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Pleasure S.J. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). To begin differentiation, 2.5 × 106 cells were seeded in a 75-cm2 flask and fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) HG (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10 μM retinoic acid, 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin twice weekly for 5 weeks. The cells were then replated (Replate 1 cells) at a lower density. After 2 days, cells were enzymatically and mechanically dislodged, counted, and replated at a density of 7.5 × 106 cells per 10-cm dishes (Replate 2 cells) on polylysine and Matrigel in medium containing mitotic inhibitors (1 μM cytosine arabinoside, 10 μM fluorodeoxyuridine, and 10 μM uridine). To obtain 99% pure neurons (Replate 3 cells), Replate 2 cells were plated at a density of 25 × 106 cells per 75-cm2 flasks for about 1 week after which they were removed enzymatically and mechanically to generate nearly pure NT2N neurons. Cultures of Replate 2 or Replate 3 NT2N cells were used for experiments when they were 3-4 weeks old except for those used in the maturation studies. Cultured NT2N cells were incubated in methionine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min before the addition of [S]methionine (100-400 μCi/ml) (ICN Radiochemicals) to the methionine-free DMEM. For pulse-labeling studies, NT2N cells were labeled with [S]methionine continuously for 0-24 h. For pulse-chase studies, cells were labeled with [S]methionine for 3 or 4 h, washed twice with methionine-containing DMEM, and chased in the same medium for 0-24 h. Cell lysates were prepared as described elsewhere(20.Golde T.E. Estus S. Younkin L.H. Selkoe D.J. Younkin S.G. Science. 1992; 255: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid procedure (Pierce). Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the proteins in the supernatant were either immunoprecipitated with antibodies directly or they were precipitated with an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate, pH 7.5, at 4°C for 2 h. After recentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, the pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of 1 × radioimmune precipitation buffer (20.Golde T.E. Estus S. Younkin L.H. Selkoe D.J. Younkin S.G. Science. 1992; 255: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) followed by immunoprecipitation as described previously(26.Wertkin A.W. Turner R.S. Pleasure S.J. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9513-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Aβ and APPs were separated either on 7.5% Laemmli SDS-PAGE gels or on 10/16.5% step gradient Tris-Tricine gels, whereas Aβ was separated either on 10/16.5% step-gradient or 16.5% Tris-Tricine gels(20.Golde T.E. Estus S. Younkin L.H. Selkoe D.J. Younkin S.G. Science. 1992; 255: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R (Pierce), treated with ENHANCE (DuPont NEN), dried, and placed on PhosphorImager plates (Molecular Dynamics) for 72 h. Quantitation of S-labeled proteins was performed using the ImageQuant software provided with the PhosphorImager. Gels were also analyzed by standard autoradiographic methods. NT2N cells were metabolically labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [S]methionine for 16 h as described above. After rinsing twice in PBS, the NT2N cells were incubated on ice for 20 min either with PBS alone, or with 10 μg/ml of trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in PBS in the presence or absence of 0.1% Triton X-100. The trypsin in the cultures was inactivated by the addition of 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The treated NT2N cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped into cell lysis buffer, and processed for immunoprecipitation with 6E10, an anti-Aβ antibody, as described above. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation included a goat polyclonal antisera (Karen) raised to APPs (a kind gift of Dr. Barry Greenberg), a monoclonal antibody (6E10) specific for Aβ1-17(34.Kim K.S. Wen G.Y. Banker C. Chen C.M.J. Sapienza V.J. Hong H. Wisniewski H.M. Neurosci. Res. Commun. 1990; 7: 113-122Google Scholar), and polyclonal antisera SGY2134 and 2332 which bind most avidly to amino acids 1-17 of the Aβ peptide(24.Shoji M. Golde T.E. Ghiso J. Cheung T.T. Estus S.

Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). For immunodetection of Aβ in conditioned medium or cell lysates, a sandwich ELISA was performed as described previously(29.Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.-D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). In brief, Aβ in samples were captured with BAN-50, a mAb which is specific for the first 10 amino acid of Aβ. The presence of Aβ and Aβ in samples was detected specifically by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BA-27, a mAb specific for Aβ and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BC-05, a mAb specific for Aβ. This sandwich ELISA has a detection limit of <1 fmol/well. The monoclonal antibodies BAN50, BA-27, and BC-05 were prepared as described previously(29.Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.-D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the Aβ recovered from NT2N cells is indeed produced intracellularly and not in association with the cell surface, we treated cultures of NT2N cells with trypsin at 4°C. Under such conditions, cell surface-associated but not intracellular Aβ is expected to be destroyed. Fig. 1 shows that a similar amount of Aβ was recovered from NT2N cells treated or untreated with trypsin (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 2). By contrast, if the NT2N cells were treated with trypsin and Triton X-100, intracellular Aβ was completely eliminated (Fig. 1, lane 3). This experiment provides evidence that the Aβ found in NT2N cell lysates is produced intracellularly. To assess whether or not Aβ and Aβ are present in NT2N cell lysates, we utilized a previously developed sandwich ELISA to quantify the amount of Aβ and Aβ. Using BAN-50/BA-27 and BAN-50/BC-05, we detected on average 18.3 fmol/mg Aβ and 7.4 fmol/mg Aβ, respectively, in 1-week-old cultures of NT2N cells (n = 6; Table 1). About a 30% increase in intracellular Aβ (33.5 fmol/mg) and Aβ (10.3 fmol/mg) was observed in NT2N cells that were about 6 weeks old. By contrast, neither Aβ nor Aβ was found in the less differentiated NT2 cells. These results confirm our previous finding that intracellular Aβ can be detected in NT2N but not NT2 cells.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To demonstrate that Aβ is synthesized intracellularly before secretion, we isolated intracellular Aβ and Aβ recovered in the cultured medium after continuous [S]methionine metabolic radiolabeling or pulse-labeling with [S]methionine followed by a cold chase in NT2N cells. For the continuous radiolabeling studies, the level of intracellular Aβ and APP as well as the secreted forms of APP fragments (APPs) and Aβ were determined after different lengths of time (up to 24 h) of labeling with [S]methionine. Intracellular full-length APP and secreted APPs were recovered by immunoprecipitation using a goat antisera to recombinant APP (Karen). Aβ was recovered from cell lysates and conditioned medium using either rabbit antisera raised to Aβ (rabbit SGY2134 or 2332) or a mAb that binds to an epitope within the first 17 amino acid of Aβ (6E10). Consistent with our previous study demonstrating that NT2N cells produce predominantly APP695 and a small amount of APP751 and APP770(26.Wertkin A.W. Turner R.S. Pleasure S.J. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9513-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the immunoprecipitable APP protein bands in this study appeared as a single sharp band at 95 kDa and a more diffuse broader band at 100 kDa (Fig. 2A). The latter protein band probably represents glycosylated APP695 and the small amount of unmodified APP751 and APP770. The synthesis of APP is constant but the amount of radiolabeled APP recovered from cell lysates reached a steady state level by about 8-16 h (Fig. 2, A and C). Similarly, cell-associated Aβ recovered from NT2N cells also reached a steady state level of production by about 8-16 h (Fig. 2, A and C). By contrast, Aβ was detected in the medium only after a delay of almost 2 h (Fig. 2, B and D). Furthermore, the amount of Aβ recovered from the medium continued to increase beyond 8 h (Fig. 2B and 3B). These results support a temporal relationship between Aβ that is produced intracellularly and then secreted into the medium. A similar delay also was observed in the release of APPs into the medium (Fig. 2, B and D). However, the majority of the APPs secreted into the medium by NT2N cells appeared to be the result of α-secretase cleavage since antibody 92 (18.Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G. Barbour R. Blomquist C. Davis D.L. Bryant K. Fritz L.C. Galasko D. Thal L.J. Lieberburg I. Schenk D. Nature. 1993; 361: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) (specific to the β-secretase-cleaved APP fragment) detected only a small amount of a slightly lower molecular mass (93 kDa) protein by immunoblots (data not shown). Thus, APP appears to be cleaved by both the α- and β-secretases during metabolism in NT2N cells. To demonstrate unequivocally that Aβ is produced intracellularly before secretion, the NT2N cells were pulsed with [S]methionine for 3 or 4 h and then chased for different lengths of time. Notably, it was necessary to pulse label the NT2N cells for a longer period of time, since at shorter labeling times, intracellular Aβ was at too low a level to be detected. Nevertheless, it became evident that the levels of intracellular APP and Aβ decreased with increasing chase times and that only a small amount of intracellular APP and Aβ was detectable after a 24 h chase time (Fig. 3, A and C). By contrast, the levels of Aβ and APPs secreted into the medium increased with increasing chase time (Fig. 3, B and D). These studies demonstrate definitively that Aβ is produced intracellularly before secretion. Since Aβ and Aβ are produced intracellularly in NT2N cells before secretion, we sought to determine the levels of Aβ and Aβ secretion into the cultured medium in a 24-h period using a sandwich ELISA with Aβ carboxyl-terminal-specific antibodies. Table 1 shows that, after 24 h, both Aβ and Aβ are secreted into the medium. However, we noted that much higher levels of Aβ were secreted into the medium. In fact, out of the total pool of Aβ/Aβ secreted by the NT2N cells, only about 5% is Aβ, which is in sharp contrast to the ratio of these Aβ peptides produced intracellularly in NT2N cells. Table 1 shows that about 20-30% of the intracellular Aβ is Aβ, versus only 4-6% of the secreted Aβ is Aβ. This suggests that some of the intracellular Aβ is either degraded inside the cell or converted to Aβ or differentially modified. We next compared the levels of both Aβ and Aβ in samples of 24-h conditioned medium from NT2N cells of different ages. We also observed a steady increase in the secretion of both Aβ and Aβ from NT2N cells over time in culture (Fig. 4). A 5-7-fold increase in both Aβ and Aβ can be observed in cultures that are about 6-7 weeks old. A plateau also was reached by this time and a longer time in culture resulted in a slight decrease in the levels of Aβ and Aβ which probably was a consequence of cell death (data not shown). The ratio of secreted Aβ to Aβ remained constant with cellular maturation and Aβ representing 5.1 ± 1.2% (mean ± standard deviation, n = 92) of the total (Fig. 5). It is presently unclear whether this increase in Aβ peptides represents greater secretion or decreased clearance of Aβ with maturation. Increased Aβ secretion is unlikely to be due to cellular proliferation, since NT2N cells are postmitotic and the total protein per culture dish as well as the total amount of APP were relatively constant over time.Figure 5The proportion of secreted Aβ and Aβ remains constant with NT2N cell maturation. NT2N cell-conditioned medium was analyzed by ELISA as described in the legend to Fig. 4, and the proportions of Aβ and Aβ are expressed as a percent of total Aβ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we show for the first time that both Aβ and Aβ are produced intracellularly in NT2N cells. Although cell-associated Aβ has been detected in NT2N cells and human neuroblastoma SY5Y cells(31.Fuller S.J. Storey E. Li Q.-X. Smith A.I. Beyreuther K. Masters C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8091-8098Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), no other cell line has been shown to produce detectable levels of intracellular Aβ and Aβ. The presence of Aβ in the neuron-like NT2N cells and its subsequent secretion suggests that human CNS neurons may contribute to the formation of amyloid plaques, since recent studies have shown that Aβ is the major Aβ species in amyloid plaque cores (35.Miller D.L. Papayannopoulos I.A. Styles J. Bobin S.A. Lin Y.Y. Biemann K. Iqbal K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 36.Roher A.E. Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Gowing E. Ball M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10836-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence were presented here to demonstrate that both Aβ and Aβ are produced intracellularly prior to secretion. First, Aβ was recovered from NT2N cell lysates even after intact NT2N cells were treated with trypsin. Such treatment would eliminate cell surface associated Aβ but not intracellular Aβ. Indeed, the loss of Aβ following trypsin treatment of detergent permeabilized NT2N cells further confirmed the intracellular location of Aβ in NT2N cells. Second, the steady state metabolic labeling experiments showed that Aβ was detected intracellularly before it was recovered in the medium. In fact, there was a lag time of about 2 h before the detection of secreted radiolabeled Aβ and APPs from the medium. Third, the pulse-chase experiments showed that newly synthesized APP and freshly produced Aβ from cell lysates could be chased into the medium after a lag time of about one hour. Finally, our ELISA data showed that both Aβ and Aβ peptides were present at much higher levels in NT2N cell-conditioned medium than in NT2N cell lysate suggesting that Aβ and Aβ that were produced intracellularly eventually accumulated in the medium. Previously we showed that, after a 15-min pulse, a 95-kDa band corresponding to APP695 was detected in the NT2N cells(26.Wertkin A.W. Turner R.S. Pleasure S.J. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9513-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that prolonged labeling resulted in the appearance of diffused bands from about 95-110 kDa. This higher molecular mass material most likely represents glycosylated APP695, although the presence of small amounts of APP751 and APP770 cannot be ruled out. Further, prolonged pulse labeling was required for the detection of intracellular Aβ before chase since the level of intracellular Aβ was quite low even after a 3-4-h pulse. Thus, it was not possible to determine the exact time course of the reduction of the intracellular pool of Aβ even though we were able to monitor and quantitate the accumulation of secreted Aβ over time after pulse labeling. Our data show that as much as 30% of the total Aβ produced intracellularly in the NT2N cells is Aβ. Currently, it is unclear whether or not Aβ and Aβ are produced in the same or different intracellular compartments, or whether intracellular Aβ is the precursor of intracellular Aβ. The detection of both Aβ and Aβ in the intracellular compartment of the NT2N cells will provide a useful system to dissect the pathways leading to the generation of these two forms of Aβ. Our observation that 30% of the total intracellular Aβ is Aβ while only about 5-6% of the total Aβ released into the medium is Aβ suggests a hitherto unanticipated complexity in Aβ metabolism. For example, some of the Aβ could be degraded intracellularly before secretion, thereby reducing the amount of Aβ recovered in the medium. Alternatively, multiple pathways could be involved in the production of secreted Aβ especially since the production of Aβ has been shown to involve both secretory and lysosomal pathways(16.Esch F.S.

Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). One such pathway involves the rapid reinternalization of membrane inserted APP into early endosomes followed by excision and release of the Aβ peptide(21.Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Since intracellular Aβ has not been detected in cultured cells that undergo APP reinternalization, and since Aβ is the major Aβ species recovered from the medium(29.Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.-D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar), we speculate that this secretory pathway may lead to the production of Aβ but not Aβ. Thus, by selectively increasing the production of secreted Aβ, the amount of Aβ recovered in the medium would increase. This increase would alter the ratio of Aβ and Aβ such that Aβ to Aβ would be higher in the medium than in the cell lysate. We also noted a 5-7-fold increase in Aβ and Aβ secretion as the NT2N cells matured in culture. This increase in Aβ and Aβ secretion was not due to a concomitant increase in APP synthesis or intracellular Aβ and Aβ since the amount of intracellular Aβ and Aβ is increased by only about 30% even after 6 weeks in culture. Thus, it appears that APP processing is altered as NT2N cells age in culture such that the production of secreted Aβ and Aβ is dramatically increased. It is unclear at the present time whether this is due to increased β-secretase or reduced α-secretase activities. Future studies will directly address this important issue since the aging of NT2N cells in culture may recapitulate key aspects of the aging brain by increasing the production of Aβ peptides leading to amyloid deposition. Finally, our ability to detect intracellular Aβ and Aβ suggests that the NT2N cells may be a unique system to identify the β- and -secretases that produce Aβ and Aβ in neurons. We thank Drs. D. Cooke, R. Doms, T. Golde, and J. Q. Trojanowski for critical review of the manuscript. We also thank C. D. Page for some of the cultured cells used in this study, and Dr. L.

https://openalex.org/W1553277501,"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor activates several signaling cascades in response to the ligands EGF and amphiregulin (AR).

Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Six different polypeptide ligands, which derive from distinct genes, are capable of binding to the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor. These ligands include EGF, transforming growth factor-α, amphiregulin (AR), heparin binding EGF-like growth factor, epiregulin, and betacellulin(2.Johnson G.R. Trends Glycosci.

All of these growth factors contain a characteristic EGF-like domain, which is defined by 6 evenly spaced cysteine residues that generate 3 loops through the formation of disulfide bonds. In the case of AR it has been demonstrated that heparan sulfate proteoglycans are necessary for activation of the EGF receptor and a cellular response(3.Johnson G.R. Wong L. J. Biol.

Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). Among the target proteins that become phosphorylated in response to EGF are mitogen-activated protein kinase, the adapter protein SHC, the GTPase-activating protein of p21ras, phospholipase C-γ, the phosphotyrosine phosphatase 1D, as well as the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Jak1 (5.Shuai K.

Several reports have shown that the intrinsic receptor kinase activity is necessary for activation of a subset of these proteins, whereas others can be activated also via a kinase-inactive EGF receptor(9.Wright J.D.

Additional mutations have allowed for the identification of receptor domains that are needed for cell motility, mitogenesis, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase or phospholipase C-γ(12.Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 13.Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In the case of the STAT proteins it has been suggested that the phosphorylation of the receptor itself on tyrosine residues is a requirement for their activation(14.Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Based on mutational analysis of several cytokine receptors and the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the STAT proteins, it is believed that the specificity of STAT activation is conferred by an interaction between the distinct tyrosine phosphorylation sites of a certain receptor and the SH2 domains of a STAT(15.Stahl N.

In this report we show that the EGF receptor kinase activity is needed for STAT tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas the presence of Jak1 is not necessary. Furthermore, we provide evidence, using a truncated receptor lacking all autophosphorylation sites, that receptor phosphorylation is not required for STAT activation by either AR or EGF. epidermal growth factor amphiregulin γ-interferon signal transducer and activator of transcription electrophoretic mobility shift assay c-sis inducible element wild type Src homology 2. Establishment of NR6 cell lines expressing the various mutant EGF receptors has been described elsewhere(12.Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). All NR6 cell lines were grown in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, and L-glutamine. Characterization of the HeLa cell line lacking Jak1 has been also previously published(17.Loh J.E. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell.

Human and murine γ-interferon (IFNγ) were a generous gift from Genentech. EGF was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Recombinant human AR was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, and homogeneity was confirmed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography, Edman degradation, and electrospray mass spectrometry. 2S. A. Thompson, A. Harris, D. Hoang, M. Ferrer, and G. R. Johnson, manuscript in preparation. After treatment, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on the plates with 1.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (all from Sigma). The lysate was vortexed, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Protein concentration of lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay. EMSAs were performed using whole cell extracts prepared with Triton-containing buffers as described(18.David M. Petricoin III, E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). A probe corresponding to the optimal binding site determined for the c-sis-inducible element (SIE) found within the promoter of the c-fos gene was end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP(19.Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h prior to the addition of Protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and incubation for an additional hour. All antibodies used for immunoprecipitation have been described(18.David M. Petricoin III, E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C.

Proteins were separated on 8-16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (Novex) and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore). Membranes were probed with monoclonal antibodies against STAT 1, STAT 3, and STAT 5 (all from Transduction Laboratories) or phosphotyrosine (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; PY20, Transduction Laboratories) using concentrations and conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Immunoblots were developed using appropriate secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). It has been previously shown that EGF can stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 1, 3, and 5 such that they can bind to the IFNγ-activated sequence-like enhancers(6.Ruff-Jamison S. Chen K. Cohen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4215-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7.Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell J.E.J.

EGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 but not of the related kinases Jak2 or Tyk2(5.Shuai K. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Darnell J.E.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to investigate whether AR, another growth factor known to signal through the EGF receptor(21.Johnson G.R. Kannan B. Shoyab M. Stromberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2924-2931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also activates STAT proteins in a manner similar to EGF. Furthermore, we sought to determine whether activation of Jak1 is a requirement for STAT activation by EGF or AR, since it has been previously reported that immunoprecipitations containing activated EGF receptor were able to cause tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins in vitro(22.Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W. Witthuhn B.A. Tang B. Cohen S. Ihle J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20775-20780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To address this question we utilized a HeLa cell line that has been shown to be devoid of Jak1 (17.Loh J.E. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but contains identical levels of EGF receptor compared with the wild type (WT) counterpart (data not shown). Whole cell extracts were prepared from either WT (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-4) or Jak1-deficient HeLa cells (lanes 5-8) that were either left unstimulated (lanes 1 and 5) or treated with either AR (lanes 2 and 6), EGF (lanes 3 and 7), or IFNγ (lanes 4 and 8). Gel shift assays were then performed using the SIE, a IFNγ-activated sequence-like element in the c-fos promoter. This element was identified as a STAT binding site and has been shown to be required for maximal activation of c-fos expression by EGF and platelet-derived growth factor(8.Fu X.-Y. Zhang J.-J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 19.Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 1A demonstrate that AR and EGF can activate STAT binding to DNA to a similar extent in both cell lines, whereas IFNγ-induced formation of the DNA binding complex is absent in Jak1-deficient cells (lanes 5-8). To answer the question whether the kinase activity of the EGF receptor was required for STAT activation, we employed cell lines derived from NR6 murine fibroblasts, which lack any endogenous EGF receptors. Cells expressing either the WT receptor or a mutant receptor that is kinase-inactive due to a point mutation within the ATP binding site (M721) have been generated via retrovirus-mediated transduction and were analyzed to ensure comparable receptor levels (12.Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Relative to the WT receptor, this point mutation does not affect the binding of either EGF or AR. 3S. Rani, S. Shinagawa, and G. R. Johnson, manuscript in preparation. As shown in Fig. 1B, the kinase-inactive EGF receptor is unable to stimulate the formation of an SIE binding complex in response to EGF or AR (lanes 6 and 7), whereas the IFNγ-activated complex was not affected (compare lanes 4 and 8). Thus, activation of STAT proteins by EGF or AR requires the kinase activity of the EGF receptor but not of Jak1. To investigate which other regions in the EGF receptor were necessary for activation of STAT proteins, a series of deletion mutants of the EGF receptor (12.Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) were analyzed for their ability to induce an SIE binding complex. We found that EGF receptors truncated at amino acid 1000 (Fig. 2, C′1000, lanes 5-8), leaving one residual tyrosine phosphorylation site (amino acid 992), or at amino acid 991 (C′991, lanes 9-12), now lacking the tyrosine residue 992, were compromised in their ability to activate STAT proteins in response to AR or EGF. The formation of an IFNγ-induced SIE binding complex was not altered in these cells (lanes 4, 8, 12 and 16). These results confirm similar previous observations by Silvennoinen et al.(14.Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and were suggestive that autophosphorylation sites in the EGF receptor were necessary for activation of an SIE binding complex. However, the removal of an additional 18 amino acids, leaving the EGF receptor truncated at amino acid 973 (C′973) and therefore also lacking all known autophosphorylation sites was, surprisingly, able to restore AR- or EGF-induced activation of STAT proteins (lanes 13-16). Western blotting analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies confirmed the absence of phosphotyrosine in AR- or EGF-stimulated C′991 and C′973 receptors (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that autophosphorylation sites in the EGF receptor are not required for STAT activation by AR or EGF and that the region between amino acids 991 and 973 may contain a negative regulatory domain. To better understand how EGF and AR are able to induce the formation of an SIE binding complex in NR6 cells that express either the WT or the truncated C′973 receptor, we analyzed which STAT proteins become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to AR or EGF. Since it has been shown that STAT 1, 3, and 5 are activated in response to EGF(6.Ruff-Jamison S. Chen K. Cohen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4215-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7.Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 8.Fu X.-Y. Zhang J.-J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), we decided to study the tyrosine phosphorylation of these STAT proteins in cells treated with either ligand. Dose-response analyses were performed using 0.1, 0.5, 5, and 20 nM of either AR or EGF (Fig. 3). Both AR and EGF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT 1, 3, and 5 in cells expressing the WT receptor (panels A, C, and E) as well as in cells expressing the C′973 truncated receptor (panels B, D, and F). In both cell lines EGF was found to be a more effective activator of all three STAT proteins relative to AR. Receptor binding studies have demonstrated that EGF has an approximately 5.5- and 6.8-fold greater affinity for the WT and C′973 receptor, respectively, relative to AR.3 Therefore, in general, the reduced ability of AR to activate the STATs appears to correlate well with its weaker affinity for the receptors. Interestingly, ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of all three STAT proteins was significantly increased in cells expressing the C′973 receptor when compared with WT cells. WT and C′973 cells express virtually identical numbers of cell surface receptors with very similar affinities for EGF(12.Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Further, Western blotting analyses of whole cell lysates for STAT 1, 3, and 5 indicate that the two cell lines express comparable levels of these STAT proteins. Thus, the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation observed in C′973 cells can be attributed solely to the loss of the COOH-terminal region of the receptor. It is important to note that relative to the WT receptor, C′973 does not internalize in a ligand-dependent manner(23.Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This characteristic of the C′973 receptor may partially explain the higher level of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation that we have observed. In summary, our results demonstrate that the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase is necessary and sufficient to activate several members of the STAT family of transcription factors and that this activation can occur even in the absence of Jak1. As it has been previously shown that the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase can phosphorylate STAT proteins on the correct site in vitro(22.Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W. Witthuhn B.A. Tang B. Cohen S. Ihle J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20775-20780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that STAT activation does not require a member of the Jak family of tyrosine kinases. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that an as yet undiscovered JAK-like kinase is involved in EGF receptor-mediated activation of the STATs. We also provide evidence that autophosphorylation sites in the EGF receptor are not required for STAT activation, which is in contrast with the interpretation of results obtained by Silvennoinen et al.(14.Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Although we have been able to reproduce the impaired STAT activation observed with EGF receptors truncated at amino acid 991, which lacks all known autophosphorylation sites, we found that this hindrance is based on the presence of amino acids 973-991 rather than on a loss of receptor phosphorylation sites. Our results demonstrate that the STATs do not need SH2 domain docking sites within the EGF receptor to become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to ligand. We have previously shown that both AR and EGF induce in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor-related tyrosine kinase erbB2(21.Johnson G.R. Kannan B. Shoyab M. Stromberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2924-2931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and similar results have been obtained in NR6 WT, C′973, and M721 cells (data not shown). Therefore, it is theoretically possible that other EGF receptor-associated proteins such as erbB2 may provide the docking sites for the SH2 domain-containing STATs. However, the inability of the kinase-inactive M721 receptor to generate an SIE binding complex indicates that erbB2 cannot substitute for the requisite EGF receptor kinase activity. The fact that truncation of the EGF receptor at residue 973 results in increased ligand-dependent phosphorylation of the STATs is consistent with the previously proposed concept that the COOH-terminal region of the EGF receptor performs an inhibitory function with regard to tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates(24.Walton G.M. Chen W.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1750-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)."

Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). CD95-mediated apoptosis can be triggered following engagement of the CD95 receptor by a specific ligand (CD95L) expressed on activated cytotoxic T cells (1.Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar) and by specific anti-CD95 monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Naturally occurring loss of function mutants of CD95 and CD95 ligand in lpr/lpr and gld mice, respectively(2.Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S.

Although CD95-mediated apoptosis is currently a field of intense study, little is known about the signaling pathway along which CD95-mediated cytotoxicity is transduced. The cytoplasmic domain of CD95 contains a segment known as the “death domain,” homologs of which are present within the cytoplasmic domain of the TNF receptor p55, and several recently isolated intracellular proteins that interact with CD95(4.Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 5.Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). While expression of the death domain is required for CD95-mediated cytotoxicity(8.Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the full spectrum of its putative functions remains to be determined, since related sequences have now been observed in molecules that are not known to be involved in mediating cell death(9.Feinstein E. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Furthermore, despite significant relatedness between CD95 and TNFRp55, the bulk of evidence currently available indicates that induction of cell death by these two receptors proceeds along different pathways(10.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Expression of CD95 in any given cell type does not invariably indicate that the cell is sensitive to CD95-mediated cytotoxicity. Sensitivity of cells to the death signal induced by CD95 has been shown to be highly variable and to depend in part on their metabolic state(11.Klas C. Debatin K.-M. Jonder R. Krammer P.H. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Thus, CD95-mediated cell death appears to be regulated in cell type- and possibly activation/differentiation stage-specific fashion. Interestingly, the function of CD95 does not appear to be exclusively restricted to the induction of apoptosis. One study has shown that engagement of CD95 by mAb can trigger T cell activation(12.Alderson M.R. Armitage R.J. Marakovsky E. Tough T.W. Roux E. Schooley K. Ramsdell F. Lynch D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2231-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), suggesting that CD95 may have functional properties other than cytotoxic signal transduction which remain to be fully explored.It has been suggested that signals that induce apoptotic cell death may require activation of “death genes” or repression of “survival genes”(13.Yousefi S. Green D.R. Blaser K. Simon H.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 14.Helmberg A. Auphan N. Caelles C. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Because apoptosis mediated by CD95 occurs within minutes in some cell types(10.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the second possibility appears more likely. It has been shown, for example, that glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of human leukemic cells is caused by transrepression(14.Helmberg A. Auphan N. Caelles C. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and a number of mechanisms have been proposed to underlie transcription factor-mediated inhibition of gene expression(15.Levine M. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 405-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In most cases, repression of transcription involves DNA binding or release by factors which can be visualized by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). We therefore used EMSAs to address transcription factor DNA binding activity during CD95-mediated apoptosis. One potentially attractive candidate transcription factor is NF-κB, because it is inducible and can both repress and activate transcription of numerous genes whose products are critical to a variety of biological processes, most notably in inflammation and immune responses(16.Liou H.-C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Using cell lines that are naturally sensitive or resistant to CD95-dependent apoptosis, we show that engagement of CD95 can activate the binding of NF-κB to its specific DNA binding site in a cell type-dependent manner. However, there appears to be no direct relationship between activation of NF-κB and the cytotoxic function of CD95. This notion is supported by the observation that deletion of a portion of the death domain within the intracytoplasmic region of CD95, which results in abrogation of CD95-mediated cytotoxicity only minimally affects NF-κB activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and ReagentsThe cell lines Jurkat and T24 (from ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, Ca).

Cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) and DPI (diphenylene iodonium, 25 μM) (Sigma) were added individually to the culture medium for 1 h alone or before the addition of anti-CD95 mAb. DDC (diethyldithiocarbamate, 1 mM) (Sigma) was added to the cell culture medium in combination with DPI 1 h prior to the addition of anti-CD95 mAb. Treatment of cells with TNF-α (30 ng/ml) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) when mentioned, was for 1 h.Development of Cytoplasmic Domain Deletion MutantsThe deletion mutants were developed from the CD40-Fas chimeric cDNA by specific oligonucleotide primer-driven polymerase chain reaction as described(10.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The reverse primers were designed to contain a NotI site and to generate Fas cytoplasmic domain deletion mutants truncated at residue 311, 282, 247, 215, and 181 and designated R7, R4, R3, R2, and R1, respectively. The common forward primer contained a BamHI site for in-frame fusion to the extracellular domain-specific sequences of CD40 cDNA. The polymerase chain reaction reactions were done using a 30-cycle protocol composed of 94°C/1 min, 58°C/2 min, 72°C/3 min segments. The amplified segments were digested with BamHI and NotI and ligated to the BamHI/NotI-cut pCDM8 CD40-Fas expression vector(10.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fusion protein deletion mutants were stably introduced into MC melanoma cells as described(10.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).DNA Gel Mobility Shift AssaysT24, Jurkat, and MC melanoma-derived cell lines were treated as indicated above, and nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described(17.Ponton A. Coulombe B. Steyaert A. Williams B.R.G. Skup D. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The nuclear extracts (10 μg) were preincubated for 20 min at 25°C with poly(dI-dC)•poly(dI-dC) (80 μg/ml) in a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Following preincubation, radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (10,000 cpm) was added in each reaction and incubated for 20 min at 25°C. For supershift experiments, the reactions were incubated for 45 min at 25°C, with EMSA buffer or antibody against p65 or p50 as indicated in the legend of Fig. 2. The reactions were immediately loaded onto 5% TGE (50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 380 mM glycine, 2 mM EDTA) native polyacrylamide gels, and the electrophoresis was performed at 4°C for 1 h. The probe was prepared by annealing a 5′-radiolabeled single-stranded oligonucleotide with a 3-fold molar excess of the complementary oligonucleotide in 0.15 M NaCl. The annealing mixture was heated to 65°C for 2 min and cooled to room temperature for 30 min. The double-stranded oligonucleotide was purified on a 15% native polyacrylamide gel and eluted overnight in water. The sequence of the oligonucleotides that corresponds to the NF-κB consensus DNA binding site was: forward, 5′ AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC 3′; reverse, 5′ GCCTGGGAAAGTCCCCTCAACT 3′.Cytotoxicity AssaysCD95-mediated cytotoxicity was triggered by treatment of the different cell lines as indicated above, and viability was measured by crystal violet assays performed in 96-well microtiter plates as described(10.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCD95-mediated Activation of NF-κB in CD95-resistant and CD95-sensitive Cell LinesTo verify the possibility that CD95 may activate the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB, we performed DNA mobility gel shift analysis using the consensus binding site for NF-κB as a probe and nuclear extracts from the human bladder carcinoma T24. The T24 cell line is naturally resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis, but can be rendered sensitive by exposure to the protein synthesis blocker cycloheximide (CHX) or the flavoprotein inhibitor diphenylene iodinium (DPI) (Fig. 1A and (18.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar)). Engagement of CD95 by monoclonal antibody on T24 cells induces the binding of NF-κB to its specific DNA binding site (Fig. 1B). Several DNA-protein complexes (bands numbered 1-5 in all of the figures), revealed by gel mobility retardation, appear, which suggests that different members of the NF-κB/Rel-related family bind the NF-κB consensus sequence. The specificity of the transcription factor binding is indicated by the observation that all of the complexes disappear when the nuclear extracts are preincubated with a molar excess of cold double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (data not shown). The most prominent complex (indicated as band 2) represents the classic NF-κB (p50/p65) as shown by supershift experiments using specific antibody against p65 or p50 (Fig. 2). As a control, Jurkat cells were treated with TNF-α or with HO, both of which are known to activate the p50/p65 form of NF-κB(19.Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3394) Google Scholar). The retarded complex numbered 2 is also observed to undergo a supershift by an antibody against p65 or p50, supporting the notion that it represents the classical NF-κB (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Treatment of T24 cells with TNF-α resulted in the generation of the same complexes as those observed following anti-CD95 antibody treatment, but the activation appeared to be significantly stronger (Fig. 1B).Figure 1A, sensitivity of T24 cells to CD95-mediated cytotoxicity. T24 cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence of medium alone or medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, 25 μM DPI, 1 mM DDC or with 1 mM DDC and 25 μM DPI (DDC/DPI). Increasing concentrations of anti-CD95 mAb were then added and cell viability tested by crystal violet staining 18 h later. Percent cell survival represents the ratio the of the staining OD value of cells treated with the different chemicals and anti-CD95 mAb to that of cells treated with the corresponding chemicals but without anti-CD95 mAb.

To determine whether sensitization of T24 cells to CD95 might alter NF-κB binding activity, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using lysates of T24 cells that had been triggered with anti-CD95 antibody following exposure to CHX or DPI. Both CHX and DPI pretreatment augmented T24 cell sensitivity to CD95-mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 1A). Pretreatment of the T24 cells with cycloheximide increased the effect of anti-CD95 mAb on NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 1B). However, this is probably due to the additive effect of cycloheximide and CD95 engagement, since cycloheximide alone can activate NF-κB (Fig. 1B and (20.Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar)). DPI pretreatment of the T24 cells, on the other hand, inhibits the effect of anti-CD95 mAb on NF-κB binding activity (Fig. 1B). The low degree of NF-κB activation in this case is most likely due to the effect of DPI treatment alone (Fig. 1B).We have shown previously that exposure of cells to diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) induces resistance to CD95-mediated death by increasing intracellular O concentration as a result of the inhibition of CuZn-superoxide dismutase(18.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Preincubation of T24 cells with DPI and DDC has been observed to result in the restoration of resistance to CD95 from DPI-induced sensitivity (Fig. 1A and (18.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar)). To determine whether this reversal of phenotype correlates with any detectable modification in NF-κB binding, lysates of T24 cells triggered with anti-CD95 mAb following pretreatment with DPI and DDC were subjected to EMSAs. The NF-κB DNA binding activity was not observed to be increased, in contrast to anti-CD95 mAb treatment alone. The complexes obtained were comparable with the ones seen following treatment of cells with DPI alone or with DPI and anti-CD95 mAb (Fig. 1B).The above observations indicate that engagement of CD95 by mAb in T24 cells can activate NF-κB. Importantly, however, there appears to be no correlation between the NF-κB activation and cell sensitivity or resistance to CD95. Although engagement of CD95 in untreated, resistant cells activates NF-κB, activation is inhibited by pretreatment with a combination of DPI and DDC, which does not alter cell resistance to CD95-mediated killing. NF-κB activation in T24 cells that are sensitized to CD95, on the other hand, is not related to the sensitivity of the cells but rather depends on the reagent used to induce sensitivity. Thus, whereas both CHX and DPI sensitize T24 cells to CD95-mediated cytotoxicity, CHX augments while DPI inhibits CD95-induced NF-κB activation.To address the relationship between engagement of CD95 and NF-κB activation in different cell types, we performed DNA mobility gel shift analysis using two cell lines that are naturally sensitive to CD95, the T cell leukemia Jurkat, which constitutively expresses CD95 and TNFR, and the human melanoma MC stably transfected with the CD40-Fas fusion protein(10.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The CD40-Fas fusion protein consists of the extracellular domain of CD40 and the intracellular and transmembrane domains of CD95. CD95-mediated cell death can be conveniently induced by soluble recombinant CD8-CD40L (CD8-gp39) fusion protein overproduced in COS cells(10.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). When Jurkat cells were treated with anti-CD95 mAb, no activation of NF-κB DNA binding was observed, in contrast to TNF-α treatment (Fig. 3). Cycloheximide treatment alone was observed to activate NF-κB (mainly complex 3) in Jurkat cells, but no increase in the binding activity was seen following incubation of cycloheximide-treated cells with anti-CD95 mAb (Fig. 3). The effect of cycloheximide appears to be nonspecific, possibly resulting from the inhibition of I-κB, the natural repressor of NF-κB(21.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Contrary to Jurkat cells, MC40-Fas transfectants display activation of NF-κB binding activity following stimulation with soluble CD40L (Fig. 4).Figure 3Determination of CD95-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity in Jurkat cells. Nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells treated with medium alone (lane 2), TNF-α (lane 3), anti-CD95 mAb (lane 4), cycloheximide (lane 5), cycloheximide and anti-CD95 mAb (lane 6), as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were subjected to EMSAs using radiolabeled NF-κB consensus binding site double-stranded oligonucleotide.

The retarded complexes obtained and nonspecific binding to the probe are indicated as in Fig. 1B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These observations support the notion that triggering of CD95 augments the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in some but not all cell types and that there is no correlation between activation of binding and cell sensitivity to CD95-mediated killing. Moreover these results may explain the recent report by Schulze-Osthoff et al.(22.Schulze-Osthoff K. Krammer P.H. Dröge W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4587-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) that triggering CD95 overexpressed in the CD95 and TNF-sensitive cell line L929 does not activate NF-κB, whereas engagement of the TNFR by TNF-α does.Determination of CD95 Intracytoplasmic Domain Sequences Involved in NF-κB DNA Binding ActivationTo determine which segment of the intracellular domain of CD95 is associated with stimulation of NF-κB DNA binding activity, we used the CD40-Fas chimeric cDNA construct that served to generate MC-CD40-Fas transfectants (10.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) to develop a panel of Fas cytoplasmic domain deletion mutants. The deletion mutants, R1-R4 and R7, were truncated at residue 181, 214, 247, 282, and 311, respectively (Fig. 5A), and stable transfectants expressing each mutant were generated and transfectants expressing comparable levels of fusion proteins selected for further study. DNA mobility gel shift analysis was performed using nuclear extracts from the different transfectants stimulated with soluble CD40L for 1 h. Engagement of CD40-FasR7 induced NF-κB DNA binding activity at comparative levels to those associated with stimulation of wild type CD40-Fas, with the exception of complex 4 whose binding appeared to be reduced (Fig. 5B). However, sensitivity of MC40-FasR7 and MC40-Fas wild type the cytotoxic signal of Fas, as measured by cytotoxicity assays, was comparable (Fig. 5A). Triggering of CD40-FasR4 activated the binding of NF-κB, though to a slightly lower degree than did engagement of CD40-FasR7 (Fig. 5B), but failed to induce apoptosis in the corresponding transfectants (Fig. 5A). These observations are consistent with results obtained using T24 and Jurkat cells showing that the stimulation of NF-κB binding activity is not related to sensitivity to CD95-mediated killing. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the CD40-FasR4 mutant lacks a significant portion of the death domain required for transducing the death signal, indicating that a functional CD95 death domain is not necessary for the activation of NF-κB. Activation of DNA binding by the major NF-κB complex (band 2) was greatly reduced in MC-CD40-FasR3 and MC-CD40-FasR2 transfectants (Fig. 5B) and was undetectable in MC-CD40-FasR1 transfectants (Fig. 5B). However, some activity of complexes 3 and 4 was observed in MC-CD40-FasR1 cells. These results suggest that although the stretch between amino acids 247 and 282 of the CD95 intracytoplasmic domain contains residues that are important for the transduction of signals required to stimulate the DNA binding activity of the NF-κB complex that corresponds to p50/p65, some NF-κB activity that implicates other complexes appears to be induced by mutants in which the 247-282 residue stretch has been deleted. In addition, the segment of the intracytoplasmic domain of CD95 that is required for activation of NF-κB (amino acids from 181 to 215) is not part of the death domain, indicating that at least the classical NF-κB (complex 2) is not involved in the transduction of the death signal. The possibility that some of the NF-κB activation, most notably the faint complexes 3 and 4, may be due to signaling by the cross-linking of a CD40-associated molecule is unlikely, because engagement of a TNFR-Fas fusion protein in melanoma transfectants resulted in comparable NF-κB activation (data not shown). Furthermore, activation of the major NF-κB complex clearly appears to be intracellular Fas sequence-dependent.Figure 5Induction of cell death and NF-κB DNA binding activity in MC-CD40-Fas and MC-CD40-Fas deletion mutant transfectants. A, wild type MC-CD40-Fas and deletion mutants are represented on the left panel. Sequences encoding the extracellular domain of CD40 were fused to sequences encoding wild type transmembrane (TM, amino acids 152-174) and intracytoplasmic (amino acids 175-319) domains of CD95. The mutants generated by polymerase chain reaction were truncated at amino acids 181, 215, 247, 282, and 311 and designated R1, R2, R3, R4, and R7, respectively. The death domain (amino acids 215-304) is indicated by shading. Induction of apoptotic cell death was performed by incubating MC transfectants for 18 h with COS cell CD8-gp39 supernatant, and the viability was determined using crytal violet staining. + indicates >80% cell death, whereas - indicates <20% cell death during the incubation time period. B, determination of CD95-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity in MC-CD40-Fas deletion mutant transfectants. Nuclear extracts from deletion mutants MC-CD40-FasR1 (lane 5), MC-CD40-FasR2 (lane 6), MC-CD40-FasR3 (lane 7), MC-CD40-FasR4 (lane 8), and MC-CD40-FasR7 (lane 9) treated with CD8-CD40L (CD8-gp39) fusion protein were subjected to EMSAs using radiolabeled NF-κB consensus binding site double-stranded oligonucleotide. Nuclear extracts from MC-Neo and MC-CD40-Fas cells treated with CD8-gp39 provided a negative and positive control respectively, and extracts from MC-CD40-Fas cells incubated in medium alone provided a second negative control. The retarded complexes and nonspecific binding to the probe are indicated as in Fig. 1B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The functional significance of NF-κB activation by CD95 is presently unknown. However, the present observations support the notion that functions other than triggering of apoptosis are mediated by CD95, which may be relevant to studies on the interaction of CD95 with intracellular proteins. Our results demonstrate the presence of several complexes by EMSAs following CD95 triggering that probably consist of different NF-κB/Rel related factors present in various homo- or heterodimeric combinations. The putative effects of these factors and the identity of their target genes can presently be only speculative. It is possible, for example, that some of the observed complexes may selectively activate or repress gene transcription or alternatively have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on different genes in the same cell(23.Lehming N. Thanos D. Bridkman J.M. Ma J. Maniatis T. Ptashne M. Nature. 1994; 371: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Characterization of these factors and their target genes may help to uncover hitherto unrecognized functions of CD95. INTRODUCTIONCD95 (APO-1/Fas) is a member of the TNF 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorTNFRtumor necrosis factor receptormAbmonoclonal antibodyEMSA(s)electrophoretic mobility shift assay(s)DPIdiphenylene iodoniumDDCdiethyldithiocarbamateCHXcycloheximide./nerve growth factor receptor superfamily and is currently recognized as the principal cell surface receptor involved in the transduction of signals that induce apoptosis in lymphocytes and in a variety of tumor cells(1.Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar). CD95-mediated apoptosis can be triggered following engagement of the CD95 receptor by a specific ligand (CD95L) expressed on activated cytotoxic T cells (1.Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar) and by specific anti-CD95 monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Naturally occurring loss of function mutants of CD95 and CD95 ligand in lpr/lpr and gld mice, respectively(2.Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S.

Although CD95-mediated apoptosis is currently a field of intense study, little is known about the signaling pathway along which CD95-mediated cytotoxicity is transduced. The cytoplasmic domain of CD95 contains a segment known as the “death domain,” homologs of which are present within the cytoplasmic domain of the TNF receptor p55, and several recently isolated intracellular proteins that interact with CD95(4.Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 5.Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). While expression of the death domain is required for CD95-mediated cytotoxicity(8.Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the full spectrum of its putative functions remains to be determined, since related sequences have now been observed in molecules that are not known to be involved in mediating cell death(9.Feinstein E. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Furthermore, despite significant relatedness between CD95 and TNFRp55, the bulk of evidence currently available indicates that induction of cell death by these two receptors proceeds along different pathways(10.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Expression of CD95 in any given cell type does not invariably indicate that the cell is sensitive to CD95-mediated cytotoxicity. Sensitivity of cells to the death signal induced by CD95 has been shown to be highly variable and to depend in part on their metabolic state(11.Klas C. Debatin K.-M. Jonder R. Krammer P.H. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Thus, CD95-mediated cell death appears to be regulated in cell type- and possibly activation/differentiation stage-specific fashion. Interestingly, the function of CD95 does not appear to be exclusively restricted to the induction of apoptosis. One study has shown that engagement of CD95 by mAb can trigger T cell activation(12.Alderson M.R. Armitage R.J. Marakovsky E. Tough T.W. Roux E. Schooley K. Ramsdell F. Lynch D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2231-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), suggesting that CD95 may have functional properties other than cytotoxic signal transduction which remain to be fully explored.It has been suggested that signals that induce apoptotic cell death may require activation of “death genes” or repression of “survival genes”(13.Yousefi S. Green D.R. Blaser K. Simon H.-U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 14.Helmberg A. Auphan N. Caelles C. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Because apoptosis mediated by CD95 occurs within minutes in some cell types(10.Clément M.-V. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the second possibility appears more likely. It has been shown, for example, that glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of human leukemic cells is caused by transrepression(14.Helmberg A. Auphan N. Caelles C. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and a number of mechanisms have been proposed to underlie transcription factor-mediated inhibition of gene expression(15.Levine M. Manley J.L. Cell. 1989; 59: 405-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In most cases, repression of transcription involves DNA binding or release by factors which can be visualized by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). We therefore used EMSAs to address transcription factor DNA binding activity during CD95-mediated apoptosis. One potentially attractive candidate transcription factor is NF-κB, because it is inducible and can both repress and activate transcription of numerous genes whose products are critical to a variety of biological processes, most notably in inflammation and immune responses(16.Liou H.-C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Using cell lines that are naturally sensitive or resistant to CD95-dependent apoptosis, we show that engagement of CD95 can activate the binding of NF-κB to its specific DNA binding site in a cell type-dependent manner. However, there appears to be no direct relationship between activation of NF-κB and the cytotoxic function of CD95. This notion is supported by the observation that deletion of a portion of the death domain within the intracytoplasmic region of CD95, which results in abrogation of CD95-mediated cytotoxicity only minimally affects NF-κB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2018516352,"The cap-binding eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF4E, is a key target for the regulation of translation in mammalian cells and is widely thought to be present at very low molar concentrations. Here we present observations with the reticulocyte lysate that challenge this view. When reticulocyte ribosomes are harvested by centrifugation, most (75%) of the eIF4E remains in the postribosomal supernatant (PRS). In a reconstituted translation system we find that the ribosome-associated eIF4E alone can sustain much of the overall activity, suggesting that much of the factor in the PRS is functionally redundant. Consistent with this, our estimates of eIF4E in the reticulocyte lysate reveal much higher concentrations than previously reported. The association of a small proportion of eIF4E with the ribosome fraction appears to be functional and dependent on interaction with the factor eIF4G. This fraction of eIF4E is, as expected, more highly phosphorylated than that in the PRS; however, at least half the total phosphorylated eIF4E in reticulocyte lysate translation systems resides in the PRS fraction, suggesting that, while phosphorylation may enhance activity, it is not in itself sufficient to promote utilization of the factor. We also show that the eIF4E-binding factor, eIF4E-BP1 or PHAS-I, which regulates eIF4E activity in insulin-responsive cells, is present in the reticulocyte PRS at an approximately 1:1 molar ratio relative to eIF4E and demonstrate by co-immunoprecipitation studies that the binding of PHAS-I and eIF4G to eIF4E is mutually exclusive. These data are consistent with a potential regulatory role for PHAS-I in the reticulocyte lysate.

The association of a small proportion of eIF4E with the ribosome fraction appears to be functional and dependent on interaction with the factor eIF4G. This fraction of eIF4E is, as expected, more highly phosphorylated than that in the PRS; however, at least half the total phosphorylated eIF4E in reticulocyte lysate translation systems resides in the PRS fraction, suggesting that, while phosphorylation may enhance activity, it is not in itself sufficient to promote utilization of the factor. We also show that the eIF4E-binding factor, eIF4E-BP1 or PHAS-I, which regulates eIF4E activity in insulin-responsive cells, is present in the reticulocyte PRS at an approximately 1:1 molar ratio relative to eIF4E and demonstrate by co-immunoprecipitation studies that the binding of PHAS-I and eIF4G to eIF4E is mutually exclusive. These data are consistent with a potential regulatory role for PHAS-I in the reticulocyte lysate."

Efforts to identify the position and polarity of its 12 putative transmembrane (TM) domains have so far failed to yield a consistent topological model. Recently, we have described a method for topology mapping based on the insertion of a small antigenic peptide epitope (YPYDVPDYA) in predicted intra- or extracellular loops of the protein. The tagged proteins are then functionally expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and the polarity of the inserted tag with respect to plasma membrane is deduced by immunofluorescence in intact or permeabilized cells. We previously localized segments between TM1 and TM2, and TM5 and TM6 as extracellular and segments between TM2 and TM3 and downstream of TM6 as intracellular (Kast, C., Canfield, V., Levenson, R., and Gros, P.(1995) Biochemistry 34, 4402-4411).

Insertions of epitopes at positions 235, 736, 741, 849, 887, 961, and 1024 resulted in functional proteins, whereas insertions at positions 207, 276, 782, 797, and 815 abrogated the capacity of P-gp to confer multidrug resistance. The epitope tags inserted at positions 736, 849, and 961 were localized extracellularly, whereas tags at positions 235, 887, and 1024 mapped intracellularly. These results indicate that the intervening segments separated by TM4-TM5, TM10-TM11, and downstream of TM12 are cytoplasmic; segments delineated by TM7-TM8, TM9-TM10, and TM11-TM12 are extracellular. Our combined analysis of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of P-gp supports a 12-TM domain topology with intracellular amino and carboxyl termini and ATP binding sites and an extracellular glycosylated loop (TM1-TM2) in agreement with hydropathy prediction.

In this study, we analyzed Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with either wild type βPP (βPP-wt) or “Swedish” mutant βPP (βPP-sw) for potential differences in βPP processing. We confirmed that increased amounts of Aβ and a β-secretase-cleaved COOH-terminally truncated soluble βPP (βPP) were secreted from βPP-sw cells. As shown previously for βPP-wt cells, Aβ was released more slowly than the secretion of βPP from surface-labeled βPP-sw cells, indicating that endocytosis of cell surface βPP is one source of Aβ production. In contrast, by [S]methionine metabolic labeling, the rates of Aβ and βPP release were virtually identical for both cell lines. In addition, the identification of intracellular βPP and Aβ shortly after pulse labeling suggests that Aβ is produced in the secretory pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2091083756,"Activation of α adrenergic receptors stimulates mitogenesis in human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMCs). To examine signaling pathways by which activation of α receptors may induce mitogenesis in HVSMCs, we have found that α receptor stimulated-DNA synthesis and activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase are blocked by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). To determine directly if activation of α receptors stimulated PI 3-kinase, in vitro assays of kinase activity were performed in immunocomplexes precipitated by an antibody against the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase. Noradrenaline stimulated a time- and concentration-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase in the presence of a β adrenergic receptor antagonist. Noradrenaline-stimulated PI 3-kinase activation was blocked by antagonists of α receptors and by pertussis toxin, suggesting that α receptors activate PI 3-kinase via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Direct activation of protein kinase C by a phorbol ester did not stimulate PI 3-kinase; also, a Ca L-channel blocker did not inhibit noradrenaline-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity. Increased PI 3-kinase activity was detected in both anti-Ras and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from noradrenaline-stimulated HVSMCs. Moreover, noradrenaline stimulated formation of active Ras-GTP complexes. Because blockade of PI 3-kinase by wortmannin inhibited formation of this complex, this result suggests that Ras might be a target of PI 3-kinase. Noradrenaline stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, and a phosphorylated tyrosine protein could be co-immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 of PI 3-kinase. These results demonstrate that stimulation of α receptors activates PI 3-kinase in HVSMCs and that α receptor-activated PI 3-kinase is associated with an increase in active Ras-GTP and activation of tyrosine protein phosphorylation.

These pathways may contribute to α receptor-stimulated mitogenic responses including activation of MAP kinase and DNA synthesis in HVSMCs. α adrenergic receptors are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled membrane receptors; these pathways mediate many of the important physiological effects of catecholamines such as noradrenaline and adrenaline. α adrenergic receptors play a particularly important role in control of blood pressure via induction of vascular smooth muscle contraction (Minneman and Esbenshade, 1994). Also, activation of α adrenergic receptors stimulates cardiac and vascular smooth muscle growth and hypertrophy (Milano et al., 1994; Nakafuku et al., 1990; and Okazaki et al., 1994). However, signaling pathways utilized by α receptors in promoting mitogenic effects, such as growth-related gene expression and DNA synthesis, are unclear. It is generally accepted that activation of α receptors stimulates phospholipase C, leading to increased hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol. Both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol play important roles as intracellular second messengers that increase intracellular Ca concentrations and activate various isoforms of protein kinase C, respectively. These coupling mechanisms are typically mediated by pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins, likely in the Gq/11 family (Perez et al., 1993; Schwinn et al., 1995). Additionally, stimulation of α receptors activates phospholipase D and phospholipase A2 via pertussis toxin-insensitive/sensitive G proteins (Minneman and Esbenshade, 1994; Perez et al., 1993). Although this predominant view of α receptor signaling provides substantial insight into α receptor-mediated responses in various cells, there are clear indications that these mechanisms may not explain all aspects of α receptor signaling. For example, recent evidence demonstrates that α receptor-stimulated mitogenic responses in myocytes may be due to activation of tyrosine protein kinases (TPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: TPKtyrosine protein kinaseIGF-Iinsulin-like growth factor IMAP kinasemitogen-activated protein kinasePI 3-kinasephosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseSH2SRC homology 2TLCthin layer chromatographyHVSMChuman vascular smooth muscle cell.and MAP kinases (Thorburn et al., 1994), suggesting that α adrenergic receptors may share common signal pathways with tyrosine kinase receptors in the stimulation of mitogenesis. tyrosine protein kinase insulin-like growth factor I mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase SRC homology 2 thin layer chromatography human vascular smooth muscle cell. There has been considerable recent interest in lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3-position of the inositol ring of inositol phospholipids; this has led to the identification of the enzyme PI 3-kinase (for reviews see Carpenter and Cantley(1990), Divecha and Irvine(1995), Fry(1994), and Valius and Kazlauskas(1993). PI 3-kinase is a lipid kinase that has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation by receptor tyrosine kinases (Ruderman et al., 1990; Valius and Kazlauskas, 1993), nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (Ding et al., 1995), cytokine receptors (Karnitz et al., 1995) and oncogene products (Fukui et al., 1991). Stimulation of cells with mitogens such as platelet-derived growth factor and many other peptide growth factors leads to accumulation of the lipid products phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (Carpenter and Cantley, 1990; Divecha et al., 1995). Although the function of these lipids has not yet been determined, increasing evidence suggests that they may serve as intracellular second messengers. PI 3-kinase is a heterodimer consisting of a p85 regulatory subunit with SRC homology domains (SH2 and SH3) and a p110 catalytic subunit. A major mode of activation by growth factors likely involves docking of PI 3-kinase through SH2 domains of the p85 subunit to phosphorylated tyrosine residues(s) of tyrosine kinase receptors (Rordorf-Nikolic et al., 1994). Moreover, activation of PI 3-kinase by growth factors may occur via either Ras-dependent (Kodaki et al., 1994) or Ras-independent (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1994) pathways. In either situation, activation of Ras is sufficient to activate mitogenic responses in a variety of cells. In other important cases, such as G protein-coupled receptors, PI 3-kinase has been shown to be directly activated by β subunits released from activated G proteins (Zhang et al., 1995). In the present study, we have found that α adrenergic receptor-stimulated mitogenic responses, such as DNA synthesis and activation of MAP kinase in HVSMCs, are inhibited by wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase. This result suggests that activation of PI 3-kinase is associated with α adrenergic receptor-stimulated responses in HVSMCs. We further demonstrate directly that stimulation of α receptors activates PI 3-kinase via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein pathway. Moreover, noradrenaline-stimulated PI 3-kinase is associated with activation of Ras proteins and tyrosine protein kinases. Noradrenaline, H7, myelin basic protein, and 4β-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate were purchased from Sigma; [P]ATP (2000 Ci/mmol), [P]orthophosphate, [3H]thymidine, and ECL Western blotting detection kit were from Amersham Corp.; phosphatidylinositol was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, Alabama); human recombinant IGF-I, cell culture medium, and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc.; wortmannin was from Worthington Biochemical Co.; antibodies against PI 3-kinase p85α, p110, phosphotyrosine, Ha-Ras, and protein A/G-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other chemicals were reagents of molecular biology grade and were obtained from standard commercial sources. Human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells were purchased from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA). Cells were grown in smooth muscle growth medium-2 with 5% fetal bovine serum from Clonetics Corp. at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO, 95% air. The cells were harvested for passaging at confluence with trypsin-EDTA and plated in 100-mm dishes at a density about 5 × 105, with a 80-90% confluence being reached about 10 days later. The medium was replaced every 2 days. Cells were generally used for studies at 8-10 days after seeding. To examine the effects of agonist-stimulated changes, cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for the indicated times after achieving confluence. Throughout these experiments, cells from the fifth through seventh passage were utilized. Analysis of agonist-induced DNA synthesis was performed as described previously (Nakaki et al., 1990). HVSMCs were cultured in smooth muscle growth medium-2 containing 5% fetal bovine serum to near confluence. The medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.4% serum for 48 h. Noradrenaline (1 μM) plus the β receptor blocker timolol (0.5 μM) were added to the medium, and 20 h later [3H]thymidine (0.1 μCi/dish) was added. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined 4 h later. To examine if the α receptor agonist-induced increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation required activation of PI 3-kinase or a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, cells were preincubated with wortmannin (2 h) or with pertussis toxin (12 h), respectively. After treatment, cultures on 100-mm plates were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate. Cells were incubated with cell lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 10 nM okadaic acid, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml antipain, aprotinin, and leupeptin) for 10-15 min on the ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,100 × g for 20 min. The amount of cell lysate was normalized by protein content in each experiment using a kit from Bio-Rad. The lysate was incubated with an appropriate amount of antibody with constant agitation for 2 h and then further incubated with 20-30 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose with agitation for 1 h. The beads containing the immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times with lysis buffer, washed once with washing buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and subjected to PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase assays or analysis of Ras-bound GTP. For immunodetection, immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and twice with distilled water, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Resolved proteins were transferred to membrane and detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham) with the indicated primary antibody and an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Assay of MAP kinase activity was performed following a method described previously (Greenberg et al., 1994). Confluent cells were incubated without serum overnight and treated with noradrenaline or other agonists for various times. The cells were lysed in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer as described above. For MAP kinase activity assay, cell lysate (400 μg of protein) was incubated with antibody against ERK1 (2 μg/mg protein) and washed as above. The washed immunocomplexes were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EGTA, 40 μM ATP, 1 μCi of [P]ATP, and myelin basic protein) (1 mg/ml) as a substrate. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30°C because preliminary experiments suggested that noradrenaline-induced myelin basic protein phosphorylation is linear for 20-30 min. The reaction was stopped by spotting 10 μl of reaction mixture onto p-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman), which was then washed in 75 mM phosphoric acid with constant stirring for 1 h and transferred to another washing overnight. The papers were washed with acetone for 5 min and dried. P, which represented the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by MAP kinase, was measured by scintillation spectrophotometry. For measurement of PI 3-kinase activity, cell lysate (0.5-1 mg of protein) was incubated with antibody against the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase (2 μg/mg of protein) as described above. Assay of PI 3-kinase activity was conducted as described by Nakafuku et al.(1992). Briefly, the washed pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM EGTA) and incubated at 25°C for 10 min after the addition of 0.5 μl of 20 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol dissolved in chloroform to make micelles of PI. Assays were initiated with the addition of 5 μl of ATP solution (0.4 M ATP, 0.1 M MgCl, and 1 μCi/ml [-P]ATP) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. During this time, the formation of phosphatidylinositol phosphate was linear (data not shown). The reaction was stopped after the addition of 100 μl of chloroform, methanol, 11.6 N HCl (100:200:2). After centrifugation, the lower organic phase was taken for thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica Gel plates (Merck) to be developed in chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonium hydroxide, water (43:38:5:7). The plates were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70°C with an intensifying screen for 16-24 h or were visualized after development with a PhosphorImager System (Molecular Dynamics). Agonist-stimulated change in Ras-bound GTP was performed following the methods described previously (Nakafuku et al., 1992; Satoh et al., 1990). Quiescent cells were labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml of [P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 12 h. After stimulation with agonists for the indicated times, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline 3 times and cells lysed as described above. Ras proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Ras polyclonal antibody. After extensively washing as described above, the immunoprecipitates were suspended in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mM EDTA, 2% SDS, 0.5 mM GDP, and 0.5 mM GTP. The suspension was heated at 90°C for 3 min and centrifuged for 5 min. The bound nucleotides were separated by TLC on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate with 0.75 M KHPO for development. GDP and GTP were visualized using unlabeled standards. Ras-associated GTP was calculated from the ratio of GTP to (GDP + GTP). The radioactivity was measured with a PhosphorImager System (Molecular Dynamics). Data are presented as mean ± S.E., and treatment effects were compared by one-way analysis of variance or Student's paired t test (two-tailed). p < 0.05 was taken as the level of significance. To characterize signaling pathways involved in α receptor stimulation of mitogenic responses in vascular smooth muscle cells, we tested the capacity of wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, to inhibit DNA synthesis. Wortmannin (10 nM) completely blocked noradrenaline-stimulated DNA synthesis as well as platelet-derived growth factor-induced DNA synthesis (Fig. 1A). Noradrenaline's action was also blocked by the α receptor-selective antagonist terazosin. To determine whether the α receptor-mediated increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation was mediated via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, cells were preincubated with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) for 12 h before stimulation with noradrenaline. Noradrenaline induced an 89% increase of [3H]thymidine incorporation under control conditions; preincubation with pertussis toxin markedly inhibited the noradrenaline-induced increase in DNA synthesis in these cells (Fig. 1A). Since MAP kinase has been postulated to play a key role in mediating mitogenic responses of many receptors, including α adrenergic receptors in myocytes, we also examined α adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of MAP kinase in HVSMCs (Fig. 1B). Noradrenaline (1 μM) stimulated an approximately 2-fold increase in MAP kinase activity in the presence of a β receptor antagonist timolol. The α receptor antagonist terazosin (1 μM) blocked noradrenaline-activated MAP kinase activity (Fig. 1B). Noradrenaline-stimulated activation of MAP kinase was significantly attenuated by a 12-h preincubation of cells with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml) (about 30% increase over basal) and partially blocked by inhibitor of PI 3-kinase wortmannin (about 43% increase over basal) (Fig. 1B). Increased MAP kinase activity was not inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor H7. These results suggest that activation of PI 3-kinase as well as activation of MAP kinases are involved in mediating catecholamine-induced mitogenesis in human vascular smooth muscle cells. In addition, we found that IGF-I increased MAP kinase activity in these cells and that this response was inhibited by wortmannin but not by pertussis toxin; this result suggests that pertussis toxin was not having nonspecific effects (Fig. 1B). Several lines of evidence indicate that PI 3-kinase plays an important role in growth regulation and transformation. Analysis of mutations in the binding site for PI 3-kinase on the polyoma virus middle T antigen, which leads to either failure to associate with PI 3-kinase or impaired capacity to elevate the concentrations of PI 3-kinase products, have been found to result in a transformation-defective phenotype (Fantl et al., 1992). Similarly, point mutations in the PI 3-kinase binding sites of platelet-derived growth factor receptors impair this receptor's ability to stimulate DNA synthesis (Valius and Kazlauskas, 1993). Roche et al.(1994) have shown that microinjection of antibodies specific for the p110 subunit of the PI 3-kinase into quiescent fibroblasts inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-induced DNA synthesis. Finally, a number of studies have demonstrated that inhibition of PI 3-kinase by wortmannin, a specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor, results in blockage of growth factors or serum-induced cell proliferation (Panayotou and Waterfield, 1993; Varticovski et al., 1994; Vemuri and Rittenhouse, 1994), inhibition of protein kinase cascades (Ding et al., 1995), and suppression of growth factor-induced blockade of apoptosis (Yao and Cooper, 1995). Consequently, the present results demonstrate that wortmannin can block noradrenaline-stimulated DNA synthesis and activation of MAP kinase, suggesting that PI 3-kinase plays an important role in α receptor-mediated mitogenesis in HVSMCs. The capacity of a whole range of tyrosine kinase receptors or TPKs (Cantley et al., 1991; Rordorf-Nikolic et al., 1995; Van der Geer and Hunter, 1991) to activate PI 3-kinase has been extensively studied; the activated PI 3-kinase is believed to play an important role in signal transduction pathways of peptide growth factors (Fry, 1994). On the other hand, there is an increasing experimental evidence indicating that PI 3-kinase may also be involved in signaling pathways of G protein-coupling receptors; most of this evidence has been derived from investigations of thrombin receptors in platelets (Stephens et al., 1993; Zhang et al., 1995) and chemoattractant receptors in neutrophils (Bokoch, 1995; Varticovski et al., 1994). To determine directly if activation of α receptors expressed in HVSMCs activated PI 3-kinase, we implemented an in vitro assay of PI 3-kinase activity in immunocomplexes precipitated by an antibody against the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase (Yano et al., 1993). The results demonstrated that noradrenaline stimulated a time-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase at concentration of 10 μM in the presence of a β adrenergic receptor antagonist timolol (1 μM) (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Noradrenaline stimulated a very rapid and significant activation of PI 3-kinase that occurred as early as 1 min after activation of α receptors, with the peak activity at 5 min. The activity of PI 3-kinase declined to basal values 30 min after continued exposure to noradrenaline. Noradrenaline-stimulated activation of PI 3-kinase was also concentration-dependent (Fig. 2B and Table 1). 1 μM of noradrenaline caused a significant increase in PI 3-kinase activity. However, the increased PI 3-kinase activity declined at 100 μM of noradrenaline concentration, indicating that blunted response of the α receptors to their ligand occurred. Noradrenaline-activated PI 3-kinase was specifically mediated by α receptors because the α-selective antagonist terazosin inhibited this activation; on the other hand, the β adrenergic receptor antagonist timolol and α adrenergic receptor antagonist idazoxan did not inhibit activation of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 3, lanes 2-4). Additionally, activation of PI 3-kinase by noradrenaline was inhibited by wortmannin (10 nM) as expected (Fig. 3, lane 6).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Activation of PI 3-kinase inhibited by α adrenergic receptor antagonists and pertussis toxin. Cells were pretreated with α receptor-selective antagonist terazosin (10 μM) or the α receptor-selective antagonist idazoxan (10 μM), an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase wortmannin (10 nM) for 2 h or with pertussis toxin (PTx; 100 ng/ml) for 12 h. Cells were then treated with vehicle, 10 μM of noradrenaline or 100 ng/ml of IGF-I for 5 min. Cell lysates (1 mg of protein) were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-p85α of PI 3-kinase antibody, and subjected to determination of PI 3-kinase as described above. The autoradiogram of TLC of PI 3-kinase was exposed for 24 h. Experiments were repeated 3 times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thrombin and several chemoattractants stimulate cell responses in several different cell types via activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins leading to activation of PI 3-kinase. There are several signaling pathways that are utilized by G protein coupling to thrombin and chemoattractant receptors in the activation of PI 3-kinase (Bokoch, 1995; Stephens et al., 1993). One pathway involves pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins including P21 heterologous small G proteins such as Ras or Rho (Zhang et al., 1995). Another pathway occurs via activation of the traditional TPKs such as SRC kinases (Cantley et al., 1991). For the latter pathway, activation of thrombin and chemoattractant receptors leads to phosphorylation of cytosol TPKs, which in turn may provide phosphorylated site(s) for binding of the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase through SH2 to TPKs. Additionally, a recent study has identified a novel p110 isoform of the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase that is activated without association with the p85 subunit of the originally described PI 3-kinase heterodimer (Stoyanov et al., 1995); interestingly, β subunits released from receptor-activated G proteins directly activate this newly described PI 3-kinase catalytic moiety (Stephens et al., 1993). Although it has been generally accepted that α receptor-stimulated responses are likely predominantly mediated by α subunits released by pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins, likely in the Gq/11 family (Schwinn et al., 1995), increasing evidence suggests that pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins may also be utilized to transduce the signals of α receptor stimulation (Perez et al., 1993). To test if pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins are involved in α receptor-mediated activation of PI 3-kinase, HVSMCs were preincubated with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml for 12 h) and then stimulated by noradrenaline; as indicated in Fig. 3, lane 5, pertussis toxin completely blocked activation of PI 3-kinase in these cells. However, IGF-I (100 ng/ml), a well-known activator of a tyrosine kinase receptor, increased PI 3-kinase activity in these cells, but the response was not attenuated by pertussis toxin (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). This result demonstrates the specificity of pertussis toxin in inhibiting activation of PI 3-kinase by α receptors. α receptors are known to activate protein kinase C and increase intracellular concentrations of Ca. We found that the L channel Ca blocker nifedipine did not inhibit noradrenaline-stimulated PI 3-kinase (data not shown); 4β-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, an activator of protein kinase C, did not increase PI 3-kinase activity in these cells, suggesting that activation of PI 3-kinase is independent of activation of protein kinase C. To determine if there was direct coupling of α receptor to PI 3-kinase activity as has been found for tyrosine kinase receptors, α or α receptors were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies directed against each of these subtypes. The α or α receptor proteins could be recovered by these antibodies, but no PI 3-kinase activity was detected in immunoprecipitates of noradrenaline-treated cell lysates with either antibody, suggesting that activation of PI 3-kinase by noradrenaline is transduced by downstream mechanisms that do not invoke docking of PI 3-kinase with these receptors (data not shown). To determine if Ras and TPKs are involved in activation of PI 3-kinase by α receptors, cell lysates from control or noradrenaline-treated HVSMCs were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ras or anti-phosphotyrosine; PI 3-kinase activity was measured in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4A). There was basal activity of PI 3-kinase detected in Ras or tyrosine protein immunocomplexes from control cells; however, a significant increase in PI 3-kinase activity could be detected in both anti-Ras- or anti-phosphotyrosine immunocomplexes from noradrenaline-stimulated cells (Fig. 4A and Table 2). These results demonstrate that both Ras protein and tyrosine proteins are associated with α receptor-activated PI 3-kinase in HVSMCs. However, these data do not provide the sequence of activation of PI 3-kinase, Ras protein, or tyrosine kinases by α receptors. It is known that PI 3-kinase may act at either downstream (Kodaki et al., 1994) or upstream of Ras protein (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1994) in other cells. We further investigated the interaction of PI 3-kinase and Ras protein in noradrenaline-stimulated HVSMCs; as illustrated in Fig. 4B, noradrenaline stimulated a time-dependent increase in Ras-bound GTP in the presence of antagonists of α and β receptors, suggesting that activation of α receptors stimulates an increase in the active Ras-GTP. On analysis of the temporal relationship between activation of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 2A) and increased active Ras protein (Fig. 4B), the active Ras-GTP appeared later than activation of PI 3-kinase, suggesting that Ras protein might function as a target of PI 3-kinase after stimulation of cells with noradrenaline. This possibility was supported by the fact that noradrenaline-stimulated increase in the active Ras-GTP could be partially blocked by the specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase wortmannin as was terazosin, pertussis toxin, and genistein (Fig. 4C). We postulate that Ras protein is localized downstream of PI 3-kinase and functions as a target of PI 3-kinase. The definite interaction between the two important protein molecules in HVSMCs by activation of α receptors will require further investigation. Since increased activity of PI 3-kinase had been found in anti-phosphotyrosine protein immunocomplexes, cells were metabolically labeled with [P]P and stimulated with or without noradrenaline. Cell lysates from control and noradrenaline-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Noradrenaline stimulated phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 4D, lanes 1-3). To determine if noradrenaline stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PI 3-kinase, cell lysates from control and noradrenaline-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 antibody and then detected by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Results indicated that noradrenaline stimulated a tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 itself (Fig. 4E, lanes 1-3).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In summary, the results demonstrate that α receptors expressed in HVSMCs are coupled to stimulation of PI 3-kinase via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Activation of PI 3-kinase by noradrenaline leads to association of the kinase with activation of Ras proteins and TPKs. The results highlight the potential importance of α receptors in the activation of PI 3-kinase, particularly concerning activation of mitogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells. Moreover, these results broaden concepts relating to interaction and cross-talk of α adrenergic receptors with families of tyrosine kinases. We thank Robert J.

To identify the specific site for [3H]flunitrazepam photoincorporation in the receptor subunit, we have subjected photoaffinity labeled GABAA receptors from bovine cerebral cortex to specific cleavage with cyanogen bromide and purified the resulting photolabeled peptides by immunoprecipitation with an anti-flunitrazepam polyclonal serum. A major photolabeled peptide component from reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography of the immunopurified peptides was resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The radioactivity profile indicated that the [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity label is covalently associated with a 5.4-kDa peptide. This peptide is glycosylated because treatment with the enzyme, peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase, reduced the molecular mass of the peptide to 3.2 kDa. Direct sequencing of the photolabeled peptide by automated Edman degradation showed that the radioactivity is released in the twelfth cycle. Based on the molecular mass of the peptides that can be generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage of the GABAA receptor α subunit and the potential sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation, the pattern of release of radioactivity during Edman degradation of the photolabeled peptide was mapped to the known amino acid sequence of the receptor subunit. The major site of photoincorporation by [3H]flunitrazepam on the GABAA receptor is shown to be α subunit residue His102 (numbering based on bovine α1 sequence).

As a member of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels(1.Schofield P. Darlison M.G. Fujita M. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H. Rhee L.M. Ramachandran J. Reale V. Glencorse T.A. Seeburg P.H. Barnard E.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar), the GABAA receptor is believed to be a hetero-pentameric protein that spans the neuronal membrane to create a chloride conducting pore. The homologous subunits that assemble to form the receptor-chloride channel complex are encoded by distinct but related genes(2.Barnard E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 368-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Six α, four β, four γ, one δ, and two ρ subunit isoforms plus splice variants for many of the genes have been identified and classified by sequence similarity. However, the precise stoichiometry of subunit isoforms that comprise native receptors remains unknown. γ-aminobutyric acid 3-[-(cholimidopropyl)dimethyl ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis N-tris(hydroxy-methyl)methyl glycine high performance liquid chromatography phenylisothiocyanate phenylthiohydantoin. A multiplicity of neuroactive drugs have been shown to interact specifically with the GABAA receptor complex to modulate inhibitory neurotransmission throughout the brain(3.Dunn S.M.J. Bateson A.N. Martin I.L. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1994; 36: 51-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These include the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, some steroids and general anaesthetics, and possibly alcohol(4.MacDonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). Because of the clinical usefulness of the benzodiazepines as anxiolytics, hypnotics, and anticonvulsants, their interaction with the GABAA receptor has been extensively studied. The benzodiazepines are known to be allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors in that the classical agonists potentiate whereas the inverse agonists reduce GABA-mediated chloride conductances. An area of particular interest has been the identification of protein domains involved in the interaction of benzodiazepines with the GABAA receptor. Using multidisciplinary approaches, several groups have identified structural features of subunit isoforms that are important for ligand recognition and for the modulatory effects of the benzodiazepines (reviewed in (5.Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar)). To date, site-directed mutagenesis has identified the amino acids Gly225 of the α1 subunit(6.Pritchett D.F. Seeburg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), His101 of the α1 subunit(7.Wieland H.A. Luddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol.

Biochemical approaches have shown that the site of photoaffinity labeling by the classical agonist, [3H]flunitrazepam, is associated with the α subunit of the GABAA receptor (9.Fuchs K. Mohler H. Sieghart W. Neurosci. Lett. 1988; 90: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10.Stephenson F.A. Duggan M.J. Pollard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21160-21165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) within the large extracellular amino-terminal domain(11.Czajkowski C. Farb D.H. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2857-2863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Schmitz E. Reichelt R. Möhler H. Hebebrand J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition, partial sequences of proteolytic fragments from photoaffinity labeled receptors have indicated that the [3H]flunitrazepam site occurs within amino acid residues 8-297 of the α1 subunit(13.Olsen R.A. Bureau M.H. Endo S. Smith G. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and using subunit specific antibodies, the site has been predicted to occur within residues 59-158 of the α1 sequence(14.Stephenson F.A. Duggan M.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have mapped the [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeled peptides generated by hydroxylamine cleavage to known GABAA receptor sequences and have demonstrated that the site of photolabeling occurs within amino acids 1-103 of the α subunit(15.Duncalfe, L. L., Dunn, S. M. J. (1996) Eur. J. Pharmacol. in pressGoogle Scholar). These studies, considered together, limit the predicted site of labeling to within residues 59-103 of the α1 subunit or within homologous segments of other α subunit isoforms. In the present study, we have employed immunoprecipitation and HPLC techniques to purify a [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeled peptide that was generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage of labeled GABAA receptors from bovine cerebral cortex. It is shown by peptide mapping and microsequence analysis that the major site of [3H]flunitrazepam photoincorporation by the GABAA receptor is likely to be the amino acid His102 of the bovine α1 subunit. [N-Methyl-3H]flunitrazepam (85.8 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont Canada. Sheep anti-flunitrazepam polyclonal serum (1:7,680 titre, final dilution) was from Biodesign International; protein G-linked Sepharose 4B fast flow, flunitrazepam, and CHAPS were from Sigma. Asolectin was from Fluka, and peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase (abbreviated N-Glycanase) was from Genzyme Corporation. Cyanogen bromide was from Eastman Kodak; rainbow-colored molecular weight standards were from Amersham Corp. Adult bovine brain was obtained from a local slaughterhouse. The cerebral cortex was dissected out and was immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C. Brain membranes were prepared from approximately 100 g of partially thawed cortex as described previously(16.Dunn S.M.J. Martin C.R. Agey M.W. Miyazaki R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2545-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the photoaffinity labeling reaction, membrane aliquots were thawed and diluted to a final protein concentration of 2 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris citrate pH 7.4 buffer containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 20 μg/ml bacitracin, and 0.02% NaN3. [3H]Flunitrazepam, isotopically diluted 5-fold to a specific activity of 17.2 Ci/mmol, was added to a final concentration of 10 nM. The mixture was incubated for 45 min in the dark on ice with constant shaking, before irradiating with long wavelength ultraviolet light for 45 min using a Spectroline ENF 260C lamp at a distance of 6 cm. The membranes were subjected to repeated cycles of centrifugation (150,000 × g, 45 min) and resuspension until the radioactivity in the supernatant fell to close to the background, at which point the membranes were finally resuspended at a concentration of 15 mg/ml in the above buffer. Photoaffinity labeled membranes were stirred on ice at 4°C, and an equal volume of solubilization buffer containing 20 mM Tris citrate, pH 7.5, 0.5 M KCl, 3% CHAPS, 0.3% asolectin, and protease inhibitors as noted above was added dropwize. After being stirred for 60 min at 4°C, the mixture was centrifuged for 75 min at 100,000 × g. To the supernatant containing the photoaffinity labeled receptor, a volume of trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 12% (w/v). Following incubation on ice for 15 min, the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the protein pellets were washed twice with acetone. CNBr cleavage (17.Gross E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 238-255Crossref Scopus (758) Google Scholar) of the photolabeled receptor was carried out by dissolving the solubilized and precipitated protein to a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 70% formic acid and adding a volume of 25% CNBr in formic acid solution to achieve a final amount of CNBr equal to that of the total protein (mg per mg basis). Following 24 h of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the reaction mixture was diluted into 15 volumes of distilled water, freeze dried twice, and resuspended to about 10 mg/protein ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 buffer for subsequent immunopurification. Sheep raised anti-flunitrazepam polyclonal serum (approximately 1.25 μl of neat antiserum) was added per pmol of the [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeled CNBr peptides, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37°C. About 50 μl of 50% protein G matrix in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 buffer was added per pmol of labeled peptide, and the slurry was incubated for 24 h at 4°C with constant mixing. The Protein G matrix was extensively washed by repeated cycles of centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min) and resuspension in a series of different solutions; 1) 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl buffer, 2) 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 buffer, 3) 20% (v/v) ethanol, and 4) distilled water. To specifically recover the labeled peptides while avoiding spurious contaminants that were present in the precipitation assay, a large excess of free unlabeled flunitrazepam was used to elute the immunoprecipitated peptides from the antibody-protein G complex. A volume of flunitrazepam dissolved in 10% ethanol was added to the protein G beads equivalent to 100 nmol of free drug/pmol of labeled peptide. The slurry was incubated for 24 h at 4°C with constant mixing, before the beads were pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant containing the immunopurified peptides was removed and freeze-dried. The dried product was resuspended in distilled water, and the insoluble free flunitrazepam was removed by ether extraction. After gentle mixing with diethyl ether/distilled water (3:1) to solubilize the drug, the ether phase was discarded, and the aqueous phase containing the immunopurified peptide components was again freeze-dried. The [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeled CNBr peptides were finally resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and stored at 4°C for analysis by HPLC. Further purification of the immunoprecipitated peptides was achieved by reversed-phase HPLC using a Vydac C18, 25 × 0.46-cm column. The peptide components were eluted from the column using a linear gradient established with aqueous 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (A) and acetonitrile/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (B) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After 45 min of 1% B per min, the mixture was ramped to 90% B and held for 5 min and then returned to 100% A. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and the 3H radioactivity profile of the fractions was determined. Distinct peaks were pooled and concentrated by vacuum centrifugation for further study. The hydrolysis of all common classes of Asn-linked oligosaccharides at the β-aspartyl-glycosylamine bond between the innermost GlcNAc and the asparagine residue is catalyzed by the enzyme, N-Glycanase (18.Elder J.H. Alexander S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4540-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 19.Tarentino A.L. Gómez C.M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). For deglycosylation experiments, pooled HPLC fractions were dried and resuspended in 0.5 M sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.5% SDS, and 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Prior to the addition of 0.3 units of N-Glycanase enzyme, the sample was diluted 3-fold and Nonidet P-40 (final concentration, 1.25%) and 1,10-ortho-phenanthroline (final concentration, 10 mM) were added. The mixtures were incubated for 18 h at 37°C, before the deglycosylated peptides were prepared for resolution by HPLC or SDS-PAGE. The immunoprecipitated photoaffinity labeled CNBr peptides and the components purified by reversed-phase HPLC were analyzed by Tricine SDS-PAGE for the superior resolution of species with molecular mass in the 1-100-kDa range(20.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10377) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic separations were carried out on gels that consisted of a 16.5% T, 6% C resolving slab, a 10% T, 3% C spacer gel, and a 4% T, 3% C stacking gel (where T denotes the total percentage concentration of both monomers (acrylamide and bisacrylamide) and C denotes the percentage concentration of the cross-linker relative to the total concentration T; see (20.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10377) Google Scholar)). Immediately following electrophoresis, sample lanes were cut into 0.25-cm slices and eluted in 0.5 ml of 2% SDS at 50°C overnight, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Molecular weight (Mr) values of peptides were estimated by the migration profiles of parallel standards using low molecular weight rainbow standards. Amino-terminal sequence analysis was performed with an Applied Biosystems model 473A pulsed liquid/gas phase protein sequencer. Pooled HPLC samples were concentrated by vacuum centrifugation and stored at 4°C. Aliquots from the fractions were immobilized on polybrene-treated filters for sequencing by standard Edman degradation. The PTH amino acids generated by each sequencer cycle were directly transferred to a fraction collector instead of analyzing the derivatives by HPLC, and the amount of [3H] in each cycle was assessed by scintillation counting. In some instances, the sequencer was allowed to operate with PITC omitted from the standard reaction protocol. This allowed estimation of the amount of nonspecific elution of radioactivity during automated sequencing of particular samples. To characterize the site of photoincorporation by [3H]flunitrazepam on the GABAA receptor, a photoaffinity labeled peptide component from bovine cerebral cortex was purified by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antiserum raised against free flunitrazepam and with the precipitating reagent, protein G-linked Sepharose. In addition to quantitatively precipitating free [3H]flunitrazepam, the anti-flunitrazepam serum was shown to immunoprecipitate photoaffinity labeled peptides by specifically recognizing the [3H]flunitrazepam ligand covalently associated with the GABAA receptor. After confirming (by SDS-PAGE) that the photoincorporation of [3H]flunitrazepam with the GABAA receptor from bovine cerebral cortex was associated with a major 53-kDa protein, previously defined as the α subunit(s)(9.Fuchs K. Mohler H. Sieghart W. Neurosci. Lett. 1988; 90: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10.Stephenson F.A. Duggan M.J. Pollard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21160-21165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that there was no significant labeling of other species, the photoaffinity labeled protein was solubilized and subjected to specific chemical cleavage at Met residues by treatment with CNBr. The concentration dependence of immunoprecipitation of [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeled CNBr peptides with anti-flunitrazepam serum was investigated to assess the optimal antibody concentration for use in large scale purification. A maximum immunoprecipitation of 70 ± 9% was achieved with less than 1 μl of neat antiserum/pmol of [3H]flunitrazepam photolabeled CNBr peptide. Nonspecific adsorption of labeled peptides to the protein G matrix was measured in the absence of antiserum and represented less than 1% of the total yield. Batch immunoprecipitation was used to purify [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeled CNBr peptides in quantities sufficient for further characterization. About 50% of the total yield of immunoprecipitated product could be specifically eluted from the antibody-protein G complex by incubation with free flunitrazepam. The radioactivity profile of the immunopurified peptides resolved by Tricine SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) demonstrated that CNBr cleavage of the GABAA receptor preparation generated a [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeled peptide of 5.5-kDa molecular mass, with a minor component that resolved as a 2.5-kDa species. Unfortunately, the inadequate amount of purified protein precluded the use of silver stain for protein detection. The elution profile from reversed-phase HPLC of the immunoprecipitated peptides (Fig. 1B) displays three apparent peaks of radioactivity, arbitrarily marked (i), (ii), and (iii). Although the 3H peak marked (iii) invariably represented 55-60% of the total radioactivity loaded onto the column, the relative amount of radioactivity in the other two peaks varied between peptide preparations. The percentage of 3H that eluted with the peaks ranged from 17 to 35% for (i) and from 8 to 26% for (ii). However, the combined cpm in peaks (i) and (ii) routinely represented 40-45% of the total radioactivity. The pooled fractions from each of the radioactive HPLC elution peaks were resolved by Tricine SDS-PAGE for determination of the molecular mass of the [3H]flunitrazepam labeled CNBr peptide components. In addition, the samples were treated with the deglycosylation enzyme, N-Glycanase, to assess whether the radiolabeled peptides contained asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. On SDS-PAGE, HPLC peak (iii) resolved as a radiolabeled 5.4-kDa peptide (Fig. 2A), i.e. a profile similar to the unfractionated peptides (Fig. 1A). This peptide was glycosylated because after N-Glycanase treatment of peak (iii), the apparent molecular mass of the labeled peptide was reduced to 3.2 kDa (Fig. 2B). Reversed-phase HPLC of deglycosylated peak (iii) also showed a small but consistent shift to a higher percentage of acetonitrile required for the elution of this peptide from the column. In both the SDS-PAGE and HPLC profiles, some undigested peak (iii) apparently remained after N-Glycanase treatment, and this accounted for approximately 20% of the total radioactivity. When HPLC peak (ii) was resolved by SDS-PAGE, it ran as a broad band of radioactivity with apparent molecular mass ranging from 8.7 to 12.1 kDa. After digestion with N-Glycanase, this peak resolved to a more distinct but still broad band of 3H that corresponds to a radiolabeled peptide of about 9 kDa. It was not possible to resolve the radioactivity present in HPLC peak (i) to a distinct protein band by electrophoresis. In repeated attempts, the radioactivity showed a diffuse migration pattern spanning the middle portion of the gel that did not vary when the pore size of the gel was altered. The incubation of peak (i) with N-Glycanase had no effect on the apparent inability of this fraction to be resolved by gel electrophoresis. The [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeled peptides purified by HPLC (see Fig. 1B) were subjected to direct automated sequencing to measure the release of radioactivity during each cycle. The pattern of release of radioactive PTH amino acids generated by Edman degradation of the [3H]flunitrazepam photolabeled peptides present in HPLC peak (iii) shows that a maximum release of 3H occurred in sequencer cycle 12 (Fig. 3). The release of radioactivity remained elevated for about four sequencer cycles before returning to baseline levels. The 3H elution seen in cycles 13-16 is most likely due to NH2-terminal cleavage from residual peptide containing the [3H]flunitrazepam-associated amino acid, originally residue 12, and/or incomplete extraction of the modified amino acid. It is probable that the covalent incorporation of the ligand with a particular amino acid adversely affects the efficiency of the Edman degradation reaction. The moderate level of radioactivity seen in the first cycle likely results from desorption of peptide from the filter cartridge system of the sequencer. The pattern of radioactive release from automated sequencing of HPLC peaks (i) and (ii) were indicative of nonspecific elution during the Edman degradation cycles (Fig. 4). Therefore, duplicate aliquots of these samples were processed in the same manner as for standard sequencing, except that PITC was omitted from the reaction chemistry. The elution of 3H during the cycles from sham sequencing of peaks (i) and (ii) was parallel to that obtained for the standard Edman reaction cycles.Figure 4:Release of radioactivity from HPLC peaks (i) and (ii) subjected to automated Edman degradation. The amount of 3H that eluted with each cycle during standard conditions of Edman degradation and when PITC was omitted from the automated reaction was investigated (see “Experimental Procedures”). Equivalent amounts of radioactivity were loaded onto the sequencer for all instances. A, automated sequencing of HPLC peak (i) in the presence (○) and absence (×) of PITC. Of the 3H recovered, 28% was released during the cycles of Edman degradation, 4% was left on the filter and cartridge seal, and 68% was presumed lost in washes. B, automated sequencing of HPLC peak (ii) in the presence (○) and absence (×) of PITC; the recovery of the radioactivity loaded onto the sequencer was 17% in the normal reaction cycles, 3% remained on the filter, and 80% was lost in washes. The radioactivity released from peaks (i) and (ii) during the sham sequencing cycles (minus PITC) was slightly reduced, whereas the amount of 3H presumed to be lost in washes was increased compared with that for the standard sequencer runs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Several structural determinants required for the allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors by the benzodiazepines have been characterized by site-directed mutagenesis of recombinant receptors (see Introduction). Using this information, the benzodiazepine binding domain has been modelled as a composite of these structural features(5.Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). However, the identity of specific amino acid residue(s) in native GABAA receptors that are directly involved in benzodiazepine binding has remained an area of intense interest. One approach used extensively has been to specifically and irreversibly label the benzodiazepine binding site with the photoactivatable agonist, [3H]flunitrazepam, as first described by Möhler et al.(21.Möhler H. Battersby M.K. Richards J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1666-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although strong evidence has been reported to show that the major site of [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeling occurs on the GABAA receptor α subunit(5.Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), the precise position of the photolabel on the polypeptide has not previously been established. To identify the [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeling site on the GABAA receptor, a purified preparation of labeled peptide was required in sufficient quantities to allow for characterization by conventional biochemical techniques. The development of an anti-flunitrazepam immunoprecipitation assay has provided a highly specific method to purify the photoaffinity labeled peptides from a crude brain preparation. The [3H]flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeled peptides generated by CNBr cleavage were precipitated with an antiserum directed against free flunitrazepam that also specifically recognized the covalently attached ligand. Whereas the major component evident in the immunopurified preparation was a 5.5-kDa photolabeled peptide when resolved by SDS-PAGE, three distinct peaks of radioactivity were resolved by reversed-phase HPLC. The [3H]flunitrazepam present in HPLC peak (iii) represented the majority (approximately 60%) of the total immunoprecipitated radioactivity and was shown by SDS-PAGE to be associated with a peptide of apparent molecular mass 5.4 kDa. It was also shown that this photolabeled peptide contains asparagine-linked carbohydrate, because after N-Glycanase digestion, it migrated as a 3.2-kDa peptide. Recognizing that: 1) CNBr specifically cleaves peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of Met residues with high efficiency, except for Met-Thr and Met-Ser bonds, which are essentially resistant to CNBr and 2) asparaginyl-linked glycosylation exclusively occurs at the consensus sequence of Asn-Xaa-Thr or Asn-Xaa-Ser, the origin of the photolabeled peptide can be mapped to the known amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal domain of the GABAA receptor α1 subunit (see Fig. 5). Considering the potential sites for cleavage by CNBr and for asparaginyl glycosylation, the only peptide that could be generated from the α subunit to contain Asn-linked carbohydrate and to resolve by electrophoresis as described above is Ala91-Met114. This peptide has a predicted molecular mass of 3.1 kDa without consideration given for glycosylation, which is close to the estimates obtained by SDS-PAGE analysis. The other CNBr peptide that could be generated from the α subunit to contain Asn-linked oligosaccharide is Gln1-Met59, which would have a molecular mass after deglycosylation of greater than 6.5 kDa. Because previous attempts to sequence the α subunit indicated that the polypeptide has a blocked NH2 terminus(1.Schofield P. Darlison M.G. Fujita M. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H. Rhee L.M. Ramachandran J. Reale V. Glencorse T.A. Seeburg P.H. Barnard E.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar), the peptide beginning with Gln1 would also be refractory to the Edman chemistry. Furthermore, the peptide bonds carboxyl to Met90 and Met114 have previously been shown to be susceptible to CNBr cleavage, and sequencing of the peptides Ala91-Ala109 and Pro115-Thr130 provided the information necessary for the first cloning of the GABAA receptor subunits(1.Schofield P. Darlison M.G. Fujita M. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H. Rhee L.M. Ramachandran J. Reale V. Glencorse T.A. Seeburg P.H. Barnard E.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). The [3H]flunitrazepam photolabeled peptide has been mapped to the α1 subunit, because this isoform has been shown to occur in the vast majority of native GABAA receptors from bovine cerebral cortex(22.Duggan M.J. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3831-3835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although other, less abundant, isoforms of the α subunit have been identified in cortical GABAA receptors, the interpretation for the origin of the photolabeled peptide is not compromised, because the isoforms possess a high degree of sequence identity throughout this domain. The pattern of release of radioactive PTH amino acids obtained from automated Edman degradation of the major photolabeled peptide (Ala91-Met114) indicated the [3H]flunitrazepam is covalently associated with the twelfth residue, which corresponds to His in position 102 of the α1 subunit. The photoincorporation of [3H]flunitrazepam with His102 is consistent with the findings of hydroxylamine cleavage experiments that demonstrated photolabeling occurred prior to Asn103, as well as previous reports that predicted the site occurred within limited subunit domains (see Introduction). The involvement of a histidine residue in the interaction of benzodiazepines with the GABAA receptor was implicated in earlier studies that investigated the effects of chemical modification and the pH dependence of radioligand binding(23.Lambolez B. Rossier J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24.Lambolez B Deschamps C-M. Rossier J. Neurochem. Int. 1989; 15: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition, His102 of the α1 subunit is the residue that was shown by point mutation to be required for the high affinity binding of benzodiazepine agonists in recombinantly expressed GABAA receptors (7.Wieland H.A. Luddens H. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1426-1429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chemical nature of the radioactivity present in HPLC peaks (i) and (ii) has not been established. HPLC peak (ii), which accounted for 10-25% of the total radioactivity, resolved by SDS-PAGE to a molecular mass ranging from 9 to 12 kDa, with deglycosylation causing a marginal shift in the gel profile that indicated a 9-kDa photolabeled peptide. The radioactivity profile obtained from direct sequencing of peak (ii) did not suggest the [3H]flunitrazepam label was associated with a particular amino acid residue. Automated sequencing in the absence of PITC demonstrated that the release of radioactivity seen during the first few cycles of Edman degradation was not due to the generation of radiolabeled PTH amino acids resulting from NH2-terminal cleavage of a labeled peptide. Although a reliable prediction for the origin of the photolabeled peptide is difficult, we can speculate that a 9-kDa peptide containing [3H]flunitrazepam-labeled His102 could result from incomplete cleavage at one or more of the potential CNBr sites in the NH2-terminal domain of the α subunits. Alternatively, the peptide may have been generated from a different domain of the α subunit or from another subunit subtype, thereby representing a minor fraction of photolabel incorporated with a residue other than His102. Recent studies have suggested that the benzodiazepine binding domain is made up of determinants from both the α and γ subunits. Site-directed mutagenesis has found that Thr142 of the γ subunit is involved in conferring the modulatory effects of benzodiazepine ligands (8.Mihic S.J. Whiting P.J. Klein R.L. Wafford K.A. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 32768-32773Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and previous photoaffinity labeling experiments have shown data that suggest some [3H]flunitrazepam label may incorporate with the γ subunit(14.Stephenson F.A. Duggan M.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The apparent inability to resolve the radioactivity present in HPLC peak (i) by electrophoresis suggested the [3H]flunitrazepam was not associated with a distinct peptide. In addition, the radioactivity profiles obtained from automated sequencing of peak (i) were not consistent with the release of labeled PTH amino acids from the Edman degradation reaction. It is possible that the peak (i) fraction of the immunopurified product may represent free [3H]flunitrazepam or ligand incorporated with carbohydrate or some other nonprotein molecule. In conclusion, we have presented evidence that photoaffinity labeling of the GABAA receptor with [3H]flunitrazepam leads to the covalent association of the ligand with His102 of the α subunit. Despite our intention to characterize the photolabeled peptide components by microsequence analysis, current technical limitations and insufficient yields of the purified peptides have precluded the identification of the PTH amino acids generated during each cycle. Therefore, although His102 of the α subunit is likely to be the major site of photoincorporation, it is not possible to substantiate the possible existence of other amino acids that may be photolabeled by [3H]flunitrazepam.

We determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the human cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 genes and identified the transcription start sites. Analysis of the upstream sequences required for transcription of the cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 genes in continuously dividing cells revealed marked differences in their regulatory elements. In the cyclin D2 gene positive elements were localized between positions −306 and −114 relative to the ATG codon at +1. Additional positive elements were localized between −444 and −345, whereas sequences that reduced transcription were identified between nucleotides −1624 and −892. In the cyclin D3 gene all of the positive elements required for maximal transcription were localized between nucleotides −366 and −167, and no negative elements were found. The activities of a reporter gene linked to the upstream regulatory sequences of the cyclin D2 gene but not the cyclin D3 gene were induced when starved cells were serum stimulated. This suggests that although the abundance of both the cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 mRNAs is increased by serum stimulation, only the cyclin D2 gene is up-regulated at the transcriptional level.

Sequences between nucleotides −306 and −1624 of the cyclin D2 gene were necessary for serum inducibility. Progression of eukaryotic cells through the cell cycle is controlled by the activity of cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) 1The abbreviations used are: cdk(s)cyclin dependent kinase(s)kbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)ntnucleotide(s)SEAPsecreted alkaline phosphataseVSMCvascular smooth muscle cell(s).(Morgan, 1995). Activation of cdks requires binding of a cyclin and phosphorylation by the Cdk-activating kinase (Morgan, 1995). In addition, the activity of the Cdk-cyclin complex is inhibited by binding to cdk inhibitory proteins (Morgan, 1995; Nasmyth and Hunt, 1993). In mammalian cells the commitment to divide is made in the G phase of the cell cycle in response to various stimuli, including growth factors. Passage through the G phase is regulated by the D- and E-type cyclins in combination with Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4, and Cdk6 (Sherr, 1993). The primary target of the G cyclin-Cdk complexes is thought to be the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and/or the related proteins p107 and p130 (Sherr, 1993). In turn, the phosphorylation state of pRB regulates the activity of the E2F family of transcription factors (La Thangue, 1994; Nevins, 1992). These transcription factors have been shown to induce the expression of several genes that are required for DNA replication in S phase (La Thangue, 1994; Nevins, 1992). cyclin dependent kinase(s) kilobase(s) base pair(s) nucleotide(s) secreted alkaline phosphatase vascular smooth muscle cell(s). The D-type cyclins are expressed earlier in G than cyclin E, thereby implicating them in the earliest events leading to cell division (Sherr, 1993). Unlike other members of the cyclin family, cyclins D1, D2, and D3 have unique cell- and tissue-specific patterns of expression (see Sherr(1993) and references therein). Microinjection of cyclin D1 antibodies or antisense plasmids prevents passage of cells through G (Baldin et al., 1993; Tam et al., 1994), whereas overexpression of cyclin D1 shortens G (Resnitzky et al., 1994). These data suggest that cyclin D1 is required for progression through G. Similarly, overexpression of cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 shortens the G phase (Kato and Sherr, 1993). The mRNA for the D-cyclins have been shown to be induced by serum and growth factors (Ando et al., 1993; Matsushime et al., 1991; Won et al., 1992), and in the case of the cyclin D3 and cyclin D1 genes this was shown to be due at least in part to an increase in transcription rates (Won et al., 1992). The increase in cyclin D mRNA correlated with increased protein levels (Ando et al., 1993) and preceded entry into S phase (Baldin et al., 1993; Won et al., 1992). Thus it has been suggested that the D-cyclins provide a link between growth factors and the cell cycle. There is evidence that the three D-type cyclins are not functionally redundant but play distinct roles in the cell cycle (Sherr, 1993). Recently cyclin D1 (Motokura et al., 1991) and also cyclin D2 (Hanna et al., 1993) have been implicated in cancer. The proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) plays a central role in several disease processes, including restenosis and atherosclerosis (Hermans et al., 1991; Liu et al., 1989; Ross, 1993). We were interested in studying the earliest G events that lead to cell division in VSMC. Given that the D-cyclins appear to be activated by growth factors at the transcriptional level in several cell types, we set out to define the regulatory elements that control transcription of the human cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 genes and to define the response of these genes to serum and growth factors. Genomic clones containing the 5′ ends of the human cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 genes (Xiong et al., 1992) were kindly provided by Dr. David Beach (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) and were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) using primers from the vector or internal sequences. To create plasmids in which the cyclin D2 upstream sequence could drive transcription of a luciferase gene a 1.6-kilobase (kb) SacI-NcoI fragment from the cyclin D2 genomic clone pD2-G420 (Xiong et al., 1992) was cloned into the SacI site of pGL2Basic (Promega) in the forward and reverse orientations to generate plasmids that were designated D2 −1624 and D2 Rev, respectively. Plasmids containing the cyclin D3 upstream sequence fused to the luciferase reporter gene were created by first cloning a 2.4-kb SacI-BglII fragment from the plasmid pD3-G94 (Xiong et al., 1992) into pGL2Basic digested with SacI and BglII to generate a plasmid designated D3 Δ−1017/-112. To regenerate the entire 3.3-kb cyclin D3 upstream fragment a 900-bp BglII-BamHI fragment from pD3-G94 was then cloned into the BglII site of D3 Δ−1017/-112, and the resulting plasmid was designated D3 −3300. A plasmid in which the 3.3-kb region was in the reverse orientation was also generated (D3 Rev). Progressive deletions from the 5′ end of the cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 upstream DNA were prepared by cutting at convenient restriction sites or by digestion with exonuclease III. A 730-bp SacI-PstI fragment from D2 −1624, which exerted a marked repressive effect upon cyclin D2 transcription, was subcloned into the MluI sites of D3 Δ−664 and pGL2Control (Promega) to study its effect on cyclin D3 and SV40 transcriptional activity, respectively. The same SacI-PstI fragment was also cloned into the BamHI site that lies further upstream of the cyclin D3 and SV40 promoters in the plasmids D3 Δ−664 and pGL2Control. In a similar fashion a SacI-StuI fragment and an SmaI-PstI fragment from D2 −1624 were also cloned into the MluI site of D3 Δ−664. Primary cultures of rat aortic VSMC were prepared by enzymatic digestion as described (Owens and Thompson, 1986) and passaged in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 μM insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 0.2 mM ascorbate). Cells between passages 2 and 7 were used for all experiments. MRC-5 cells, a normal human diploid lung fibroblast cell line, were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary rat VSMC were plated at 1-2 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates, and 18 h later 60% confluent duplicate wells were transfected with 16 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) complexed with 2 μg of the luciferase plasmid and 0.5 μg of the reference plasmid pCMV/SEAP (Tropix Inc.) in which expression of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) is under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Cells were exposed to lipid-DNA complexes for 5 h, washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, cultured in growth medium for a further 48 h, and the medium was assayed for SEAP using a chemiluminescent method (Tropix Inc.). Cells transfected with the pCMV/SEAP plasmid had SEAP activities that were greater than 50-fold above nontransfected background activity, and SEAP activities were used to correct for differences in transfection efficiencies between different wells. Whole cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using a commercial luciferase assay kit (Promega) and read in a luminometer with automatic injection (monolight 2010; Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, San Diego). The luciferase activity of VSMC transfected with the luciferase vector lacking a promoter (pGL2Basic) was subtracted from all data before correction for SEAP activity. MRC-5 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in six-well dishes and transfected in duplicate the next day by incubation for 5 h with 5 μg of luciferase plasmid and 0.3 μg of pCMV/SEAP complexed with Polybrene (15 μg/ml), followed by dimethyl sulfoxide shock (Kawai, 1984). Cell medium was collected, and whole cell extracts were prepared 2 days later and assayed for SEAP and luciferase as described above. The SEAP activity was used to correct for differences in transfection efficiency between wells. Transient transfections of rat VSMC were carried out as described above except that for each luciferase construct four wells were treated with equal aliquots taken from a single transfection mix. Cells were cultured in growth medium for 16 h, and the medium was assayed for SEAP activity to determine transfection efficiency. All four wells were washed twice with serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 0.2 mM ascorbate) and maintained for 31 h in the same medium, changing the medium twice daily. Two of the wells were harvested for luciferase assays while the other two were switched to growth medium supplemented with 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor and 1 ng/ml epidermal growth factor for 23 h and were then assayed for luciferase activity. Primary rat VSMC were made quiescent by culturing them in medium containing 0.5% serum for 72 h, then stimulated to proliferate by the addition of 20% serum and 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor for 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 48 h after which RNA was extracted using RNA-STAT 60 (Tel-test “B”). For Northern blot analysis RNA was fractionated in formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.), and fixed to the filter by UV irradiation. Radiolabeled probes were prepared by random prime labeling of the human cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 cDNA clones (kindly provided by D. Beach). Hybridization and washing of the filters were performed according to published methods (Church and Gilbert, 1984). Total RNA was prepared from normal human lung biopsy samples using RNA-STAT 60 (Tel-test “B”) or from MRC-5 cells by the method of Chirgwin et al. (1979). A SmaI-SacI fragment from D2 Δ−306 spanning nucleotides −1 to −306 of the cyclin D2 gene was cloned into SmaI/SacI-digested pSVSport-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The resulting plasmid was linearized with EcoRI and transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-P]rATP to generate an antisense RNA probe. A SstII/SmaI fragment spanning nucleotides −279 to +40 of the cyclin D3 gene was isolated from pD3G94 and cloned into the HincII site of pT7T318u (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Orientation of the insert was determined by DNA sequencing, and after linearizing the plasmid with HindIII it was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase as described above to generate an antisense RNA probe. Ribonuclease protection was performed as described (Gilman, 1987) using the probes described above and total RNA from MRC-5 cells or human lung. Yeast RNA was used as a negative control. The size of protected products was determined from a sequencing ladder run alongside the samples. DNA fragments were 5′ end labeled with [-P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase, then one end of the fragment was removed by digestion with an appropriate restriction enzyme. Footprinting with nuclear extract from HeLa cells (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was performed as described (Briggs et al., 1986). Northern blot analysis of cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 mRNA in primary cultures of rat VSMC (Fig. 1) showed both were induced from low or undetectable basal levels by serum stimulation. A single cyclin D2 mRNA species with a size of approximately 3.4 kb (panel A) and two cyclin D3 mRNA species of 3.9 and 6.2 kb (panel B) were detected. Induction of the cyclin D2 mRNA was evident after 3 h of serum stimulation, reached a maximum at 9 h, and remained elevated at the 12 and 24 h time points. The cyclin D3 transcripts were both elevated after 6 h of serum stimulation and showed maximum induction by 12 h. The larger cyclin D3 mRNA species declined to near basal levels by 24 h, while the smaller mRNA species remained elevated at the 24 and 48 h time points. These data show that the mRNA for both cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 are induced rapidly when quiescent rat VSMC are stimulated to proliferate. We determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5′ upstream regions of the human cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 genes (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). The sequences are numbered relative to the ATG codon at +1. Ribonuclease protection was used to determine the 5′ end of the cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 mRNA using RNA from MRC-5 cells and human lung. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 mRNA are both expressed in human lung and MRC-5 cells (data not shown). Using an RNA probe spanning nucleotides −306 to −1 of the cyclin D2 gene, 11 protected fragments were evident after hybridization to both MRC-5 and human lung RNA, whereas no protected bands were detected with yeast RNA (Fig. 4, panel A). This indicates that multiple transcription initiation sites are utilized. The transcription start sites predicted from the sizes of these protected fragments are indicated by the stars in Fig. 2. Primer extension analysis using a primer spanning nt −13 to −35 from the cyclin D2 gene and RNA from human lung gave rise to one major and three minor extension products (data not shown). The location of these stop sites is marked by the # marks on Fig. 2. The major primer extension product corresponds to one of the start sites detected by ribonuclease protection (labeled 6 in Fig. 4, panel A). In addition one of the minor primer extension products equates to a start site at position −137, and this lies just 3 nt upstream of a cluster of three start sites detected by ribonuclease protection (7, 8, 9 in Fig. 4, panel A). This 3-nt difference lies within the margin of error expected for the calculation of the size of the protected bands in the ribonuclease protection assay. The more 5′ start sites detected by ribonuclease protection may not have been detected by primer extension because of premature termination of the reverse transcriptase. The start sites detected by ribonuclease protection and primer extension span a region of 130 nt from position −243 to −113 of the cyclin D2 gene. The 5′ end of the longest published cyclin D2 cDNA (Palmero et al., 1993) lies at position −155 on the sequence in Fig. 2 and is 9 nt 3′ of a cluster of start sites detected by ribonuclease protection and primer extension.Figure 3Nucleotide sequence of the upstream region of the human cyclin D3 gene.

Protected fragments are indicated by the arrows, and the star indicates some undigested probe. Panel B, an antisense probe spanning nucleotides +40 to −279 from the cyclin D3 gene was hybridized to 20 μg of yeast RNA (lanes 1 and 3) or 20 μg of MRC-5 RNA (lanes 2 and 4) at 55°C (lanes 1 and 2) or 62°C (lanes 3 and 4).

At least two major and four minor protected fragments were detected, and the locations of the start sites predicted by these bands are indicated by the stars above the sequence in Fig. 3. This indicates that the cyclin D3 gene also utilizes multiple transcription start sites. Attempts to map the 5′ end of the cyclin D3 mRNA by primer extension analysis with several different primers gave inconsistent results that did not correspond to the ribonuclease protection data. This may have been caused by secondary structure in the mRNA due to its high G/C content in this region. The 5′ end of the longest published cDNA sequence (Motokura et al., 1992) corresponds to position −162 on the sequence in Fig. 3 which is 15 nt upstream of the 5′-most start site detected by ribonuclease protection. This discrepancy could be a result of the different sources of RNA used in the synthesis of the cDNA library and the ribonuclease protection assay. Putative transcription factor binding sites were identified in the cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 upstream sequences using the TFD data base (Ghosh, 1993) and the Macpattern Program (Fuchs, 1994) and are indicated below the sequence in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. All of the transcription start sites identified in the cyclin D2 gene, with the exception of the two 3′-most ones, lie within, or a few nt away from a sequence matching the CAP site from other genes. The CAP site is the loosely conserved sequence within which transcription initiates. One of the transcription start sites (band 5 in Fig. 4, panel A) also lies within a consensus CAAT box (binding site for NFY/CTF) while another pair of start sites that correspond to the strongest protected fragments (bands 3 and 4 in Fig. 4, panel A) lie within a potential AP2 binding site. However, no TATA box was evident in the vicinity of the transcription start sites. Putative binding sites for Sp1, C/EBP, PEA3, PuF, NFκB, SIF, E2F, GCF, and AP1 were also identified in the cyclin D2 upstream sequence. In addition, a region with sequence identity at 9 of 12 positions to the binding site of a serum-inducible protein from the cyclin D1 promoter (Herber et al., 1994) was identified between nt −587 and −575. Inspection of the cyclin D3 upstream sequence showed no canonical TATA box close to the transcription start sites, but there were potential binding sites for Sp1 and AP2 about 10 nt downstream of the two most 5′ start sites. In addition one of the two major start sites (labeled 3 in Fig. 4, panel B) lies within a potential AP2 site. Putative binding sites for CTF/NFY, C/EPB, PEA3, PuF, AP1, p53, and Myb were also identified in the cyclin D3 upstream sequence. Reporter constructs were made in which the 5′ upstream sequences of the human cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 genes were fused to a luciferase reporter gene. The sites of fusion were within the untranslated leader sequence of the cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 genes at positions −1 and −112, respectively. When transfected into primary rat VSMC, a construct containing sequences −1624 to −1 from the cyclin D2 gene (D2 −1624) was able to direct expression of luciferase activity (Fig. 5) which on average was 3-4 × 104 relative light units/9.6-cm2 well. No activity was detected when the upstream sequence was inserted in the reverse orientation (D2 Rev), demonstrating the presence of orientation-dependent transcription. Progressive deletion to positions −1303, −1204, and −892 resulted in a stepwise increase in activity, reaching a maximum of 660% of the D2 −1624 construct (Fig. 5). This indicates that sequences between −1624 and −892 of the cyclin D2 gene contain a negative regulatory element. Further deletion to position −444 had no significant effect upon promoter activity. Deletion of nt −444 to −345 resulted in a 10-fold drop in promoter activity, indicating that this region contains strong positive elements. Removal of sequences between −306 and −114 eliminated all remaining promoter activity. Thus, sequences between −306 and −114 which contain all of the transcription initiation sites are essential for basal promoter activity, whereas sequences between −444 and −345 appear to constitute a separate enhancer-like element that increases the activity of the basal promoter 10-fold. Sequences between −3300 and −112 from the cyclin D3 gene (D3 −3300) also directed efficient luciferase activity in rat VSMC (Fig. 6). The activity of the D3 −3300 construct was on average 3-4 × 105 relative light units/9.6-cm2 well, which was 10-fold higher than that of the D2 −1624 construct in the same cells. When the sequences between −3300 and −112 from the cyclin D3 gene were inserted in the reverse orientation (D3 Rev), activity was only 8% of that seen with the correct orientation. Deletion of sequences −1017 to −112 which included the transcription start sites (D3 Δ−1017/-112) completely abolished promoter activity. Deletion to the SmaI site at approximately −1090 resulted in a small increase in activity which was not statistically significant. Stepwise deletions down to position −366 had only a minimal effect (approximately 20% reduction) on promoter activity. However, further deletion to nt −264 reduced promoter activity to 22% of the full-length plasmid, indicating that strong positive elements are located between −366 and −264. Further deletion to nt −167 eliminated all remaining promoter activity. In conclusion, sequences between −366 and −167 contain all of the regulatory elements required for maximal expression of the cyclin D3 gene in dividing cells. A subset of the same deletion constructs were assayed for promoter activity by transfection in to the normal human lung fibroblast cell line MRC-5 (Table 1). Deletion of the sequence between −1624 and −444 from the cyclin D2 promoter resulted in a nearly 2-fold increase in promoter activity. Although consistent with the finding of a negative element in this region in VSMC (Fig. 6, panel A) the magnitude of the effect was less. Deletion of sequences between −444 and −345 resulted in a 3.4-fold drop in promoter activity confirming the presence of the positive element in this region which had been seen in VSMC. Deletion to −306 did not alter promoter activity, whereas the further removal of sequences to −114 eliminated most of the activity, consistent with what had been seen in VSMC. The results with the cyclin D3 promoter in MRC-5 cells were also similar to those observed in VSMC. Deletion of sequences between −3300 and −366 had little effect on promoter activity, although a slight but inconsistent increase was observed. Further deletion to position −264 resulted in a 2-fold reduction in activity down to 68% of the full-length construct. This differs quantitatively from the results in VSMC where D3 Δ−264 had only 22% of the activity of the full-length construct. Deletion down to −167 eliminated most of the remaining promoter activity, consistent with what had been observed in VSMC.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To determine nuclear factor binding sites within the cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 promoters, we used nuclear extract from HeLa cells, a cell type in which both promoters were functional (data not shown). DNase I footprinting of the region from −555 to +1 from the cyclin D2 promoter detected a single protected region (data not shown) designated footprint Ia (Fig. 2). This protected region contains potential binding sites for Sp1, AP2, and PuF. DNase I footprinting of a fragment from −664 to −121 of the cyclin D3 gene revealed two protected regions designated I and II in Fig. 7, panel A, which lie 76 and 19 nt upstream of the 5′-most transcription start site, respectively. Both of these footprints contain potential binding sites for Sp1 (see Fig. 3), and both lie within the region −264 to −167, which was shown to contain positive regulatory elements (Fig. 6 and Table 1). A second footprint probe spanning nt −496 to −121 of the cyclin D3 gene revealed a site that was made hypersensitive to cutting by DNase I in the presence of HeLa extract (Fig. 7, panel B). This may be indicative of binding of a nuclear protein, although no distinct footprint was observed in this region. This hypersensitive site lies within a region (−366 to −264) which, when deleted, reduced promoter activity from 78 to 22% of control in VSMC (Fig. 6) and from 144 to 68% in MRC-5 cells. To confirm the presence of negative regulatory sequences between nt −1624 and −892 of the cyclin D2 gene we tested the ability of this region to affect transcription from two heterologous promoters. A 730-bp SacI-PstI fragment spanning nt −1622 to −892 from the cyclin D2 gene which includes all of the negative element was cloned upstream of either a cyclin D3 promoter/luciferase reporter construct containing 664 bp of cyclin D3 upstream sequence (D3 Δ−664) or upstream of the SV40 promoter. The fragment was placed in one of two locations: either immediately upstream of the promoter (proximal) or 2.9 kb upstream of the promoter (distal). These constructs are represented diagramatically in Fig. 8 along with the results of transient transfections in rat VSMC. When placed proximal to the promoter, the forward and reverse orientations of the 730-bp SacI-PstI fragment reduced activity of the cyclin D3 promoter to 27 and 15% of D3 Δ−664, respectively. This shows that these sequences from the cyclin D2 gene contain negative regulatory elements that can affect a heterologous promoter and function in an orientation-independent manner. Furthermore, when placed distal to the cyclin D3 promoter the cyclin D2 negative element was still able to reduce markedly promoter activity, albeit less effectively than when placed closer to the promoter. Similar results were observed with the SV40 promoter; when placed proximal to this promoter, the negative element reduced its activity to 37% of control, whereas in the distal location promoter activity was reduced to 23%. Thus, the cyclin D2 negative element affects both viral and cellular promoters. In MRC-5 cells the 730-bp SacI-PstI fragment containing the cyclin D2 negative element reduced the activity of the SV40 promoter to 48% (±8%), indicating that the negative element can also function in a human cell line (data not shown). Interestingly, two smaller fragments from within the SacI-PstI fragment reduced transcription from the cyclin D3 promoter to 14 and 32% of control (Fig. 8). Thus the negative regulatory element appears to contain at least two redundant elements. Because the mRNAs for cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 were induced by serum we wanted to examine the response of the cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 promoters to serum. Cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 luciferase reporter constructs were transiently transfected into rat VSMC that were subsequently serum starved and then stimulated with serum and growth factors. The SV40 promoter linked to luciferase exhibited a 2.5-fold induction of activity by serum (Fig. 9) which we consider to be the baseline for a non-serum-inducible promoter in this system. The luciferase activity of the largest cyclin D2 construct (D2 −1624) was increased 6.8-fold by serum stimulation, and this induction was statistically significant compared with that of the SV40 promoter (p = 0.02). When the negative element was removed, as in D2 Δ−444, significant serum induction was also observed, but it was reduced to 4.3-fold. The differenc"

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of [S]methionine radiolabeled spicule matrix proteins reveals that there are 12 strongly radiolabeled spicule matrix proteins and approximately three dozen less strongly radiolabeled spicule matrix proteins. The majority of the proteins have acidic isoelectric points; however, there are several spicule matrix proteins that have more alkaline isoelectric points. Western blotting analysis indicates that SM50 is the spicule matrix protein with the most alkaline isoelectric point. In addition, two distinct SM30 proteins are identified in embryonic spicules, and they have apparent molecular masses of approximately 43 and 46 kDa. Comparisons between embryonic spicule matrix proteins and adult spine integral matrix proteins suggest that the embryonic 43-kDa SM30 protein is an embryonic isoform of SM30. An adult 49-kDa spine matrix protein is also identified as a possible adult isoform of SM30. Analysis of the SM30 amino acid sequences indicates that a portion of SM30 proteins is very similar to the carbohydrate recognition domain of C-type lectin proteins.

INTRODUCTIONDuring the course of its development a sea urchin embryo constructs a pair of calcareous endoskeletal spicules. These spicules are rod shaped, mineralized structures which are calcitic assemblages of calcium carbonate (95%) and magnesium carbonate (5%) with an occluded proteinaceous integral matrix. The spicules are synthesized by a well characterized single tissue type, the primary mesenchyme cells. The calcite of each spicule rod is aligned along a single crystal axis, appearing as if each spicule is composed of one crystal of calcite. However, the spicule has greater flexural strength than a single crystal of calcite and it fractures as if it is made up of many microcrystals(1.Emlet R.B. Biol. Bull. 1982; 163: 264-275Crossref Google Scholar, 2.Okazaki K. Inoué S. Dev. Growth and Differ. 1976; 18: 413-434Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3.Okazaki K. McDonald K. Inou é S. Omori M. Watabe N. The Mechanisms of Biomineralization in Animals and Plants. Tokai University Press, Tokyo1980: 159-168Google Scholar). Persuasive biophysical evidence indicates that the proteins embedded within the mineral phase of the spicules, the integral spicule matrix proteins, cause these interesting physical characteristics(1.Emlet R.B. Biol. Bull. 1982; 163: 264-275Crossref Google Scholar, 4.Berman A. Addadi L. Weiner S. Nature. 1988; 331: 546-548Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 5.Berman A. Addadi L. Kvick Å. Leiserowitz L.

Faseb J. 1995; 9: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is believed that these proteins interact with specific faces of the calcite crystal when occluded within the mineral, and it is through these interactions that control of spicule growth occurs. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying interactions with noncollagenous integral matrix proteins that control the formation and the physical properties of mineralized tissues remain unknown. A question basic to our understanding of these mechanisms in mineralizing tissues is what is the nature of the noncollagenous integral matrix proteins that are intimately associated with the mineral portion of these tissues.Many proteins have been identified and characterized as noncollagenous integral matrix proteins of hard tissues from various vertebrate and invertebrate organisms (most numerously from vertebrate bone and teeth). These types of proteins usually share the general properties of being soluble and acidic(8.Weiner S. Am. Zool. 1984; 24: 945-951Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9.Weiner S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 20: 365-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, it has proven difficult to ascribe to these types of proteins precise functions within the cell that synthesize them. In addition, while many noncollagenous integral matrix proteins have been identified, it has also proven difficult to determine with much certainty what particular integral matrix proteins are contained within a given mineral phase at a given stage of development. Many of these difficulties are due to the complex structures and dynamics of the mineralized tissues most widely studied, i.e. vertebrate bone and teeth.Sea urchin spicule formation, on the other hand, is particularly well suited to ask these sorts of basic questions. The spicules are synthesized by a single well characterized tissue type and they are relatively simple mineralized structures that do not have the complex dynamics of vertebrate bones or teeth. The sea urchin embryo is also very amenable to biochemical and molecular experimental analysis. Much is known about the cell and developmental biology of sea urchin embryos and particularly about the differentiation of the cell lineage which synthesizes the spicules (for some reviews, see (10.Okazaki K.

Cell Res. 1983; 148: 249-253Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reported that the spicule matrix within the mineralized spicules is arranged in concentric sleeves of irregular fibrillar proteinaceous material with some interconnections between the layers of matrix material. The concentric layers of the spicule matrix are also reflected in the concentric layered architecture of the mineralized sea urchin spicules(2.Okazaki K. Inoué S. Dev. Growth and Differ. 1976; 18: 413-434Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Benson et al.(16.Benson S.C. Benson N.C. Wilt F.H. J.

In these studies, one-dimensional SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCRDcarbohydrate recognition domainBCIP/NBT5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium chloride.was used to resolve the spicule matrix proteins. In addition, both reports demonstrated that most of these detected proteins are N-linked glycoproteins. Total amino acid analysis revealed Strongylocentrotus purpuratus spicule matrix proteins are rich in acidic amino acids(16.Benson S.C. Benson N.C. Wilt F.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1878-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This amino acid composition is similar to that of other integral matrix proteins closely associated with the mineral portion of other mineralized tissues(8.Weiner S. Am. Zool. 1984; 24: 945-951Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9.Weiner S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 20: 365-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).Two different cDNAs that encode two different spicule matrix proteins have also been isolated from S. purpuratus cDNA expression libraries. The first cDNA isolated encodes a protein designated SM50 which has a deduced amino acid sequence with a molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa(18.Sucov H.M. Benson S. Robinson J.J. Britten R.J.

The second cDNA cloned encodes a protein designated SM30 which has a derived amino acid sequence with a molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa(22.George N.C. Killian C.E. Wilt F.H. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The predicted chemical characteristics of the deduced amino acid sequences of SM50 and SM30 cDNAs are somewhat different. The cloned SM50 cDNA encodes a protein with an alkaline pI without any consensus N-linked glycosylation site(21.Katoh-Fukui Y. Noce T. Ueda T. Fujiwara Y. Hashimoto N. Higashinakagawa T. Killian C. Livingston B. Wilt F. Benson S. Sucov H. Davidson E.H. Dev. Biol. 1991; 145: 201-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cloned SM30 cDNA encodes an acidic protein that contains a consensus N-linked glycosylation site(22.George N.C. Killian C.E. Wilt F.H. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Both SM50 and SM30 transcripts are expressed exclusively in the primary mesenchyme cells(19.Benson S. Sucov H. Stephens L. Davidson E. Wilt F. Dev. Biol. 1987; 120: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22.George N.C. Killian C.E. Wilt F.H. Dev.

Biol. 1987; 120: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have shown that SM50 is a single copy gene in S. purpuratus. Alternatively, there is experimental evidence that there is a small family of SM30 protein genes. Akasaka et al.(23.Akasaka K. Frudakis T.N. Killian C.E. George N.C. Yamasu K. Khaner O. Wilt F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20592-20598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) presented Southern blotting analysis indicating that there are between two and four copies of SM30 genes present in the S. purpuratus haploid genome. Akasaka et al.(23.Akasaka K. Frudakis T.N. Killian C.E. George N.C. Yamasu K. Khaner O. Wilt F. J. Biol.

These two SM30 genes were designated SM30-α and SM30-β. Initial characterization of the genomic regulatory regions of the SM50 gene and the SM30-α gene have also been done(23.Akasaka K. Frudakis T.N.

Sheppard P. Raff R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 549-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) characterizes a gene encoding a nonglycosylated 27-kDa protein, designated PM27, that is closely associated with growing sea urchin spicules. While they did not show directly that the PM27 protein is an integral spicule matrix protein, they do show PM27 expression and biochemistry are similar to what one might expect from a spicule matrix protein. In addition they show that PM27 has some sequence similarity to SM50; Harkey et al.(27.Harkey M.A. Klueg K. Sheppard P. Raff R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 168: 549-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) point out that portions of PM27, SM50, and the Lytechinus pictus homologue of SM50 (designated LSM34 by Livingston et al.(28.Livingston B.T. Shaw R. Bailey A. Wilt F. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 473-480Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar)) also have some similarity to the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of a number of C-type lectin proteins.The present paper enumerates more accurately the complexity of the S. purpuratus spicule matrix proteins and more fully characterizes these proteins. These studies provide a biochemical foundation important for the study of the noncollagenous integral matrices of mineralized tissues. Our findings also complement the previously mentioned biophysical studies that examined occluded matrix proteins of sea urchin embryonic and adult mineralized structures and their roles in regulating mineralized tissue formation and structure (1.Emlet R.B. Biol. Bull. 1982; 163: 264-275Crossref Google Scholar, 4.Berman A. Addadi L. Weiner S. Nature. 1988; 331: 546-548Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 5.Berman A. Addadi L. Kvick Å. Leiserowitz L.

Faseb J. 1995; 9: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The studies in the present paper reveal that there are 12 spicule matrix proteins that radiolabel intensely with [S]methionine and approximately three dozen other spicule matrix proteins that are less highly radiolabeled. The majority of the spicule matrix proteins have an acidic pI, while several other moderately radiolabeled to less radiolabeled spicule matrix proteins have a more alkaline pI. Polyclonal antisera that react specifically with the proteins encoded by the previously cloned SM50 and SM30 spicule matrix cDNAs were generated. Western blotting analysis using these antisera identify the SM50 and SM30 proteins. In addition, comparisons are made between the embryonic spicule matrix proteins and the adult spine integral matrix proteins. Further analysis of the protein encoded by SM30-α reveals that a portion of the SM30 proteins is similar to the CRD of the C-type lectin family of proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCulturing of Sea Urchin EmbryoS. purpuratus gametes were collected, eggs were fertilized, and embryos cultured as described by George et al.(22.George N.C. Killian C.E. Wilt F.H. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Isolation of Spicule Matrix and Spine Matrix ProteinUnlabeled S. purpuratus embryonic spicule matrix proteins were isolated essentially as described by Venkatesan and Simpson (17.Venkatesan M. Simpson R.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 166: 259-264Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) except that, as a final step, spicules were incubated in 3.5% sodium hypochlorite and then washed extensively with water before they were demineralized with 0.5 N acetic acid. After the calcite was dissolved, the acetic acid was neutralized with Tris base and the spicule matrix proteins were extensively dialyzed against dHO. Proteins were then concentrated by lyophilization. Adult S. purpuratus spine integral matrix proteins were isolated as described by Richardson et al.(29.Richardson W. Kitajima T. Wilt F. Benson S. Dev. Biol. 1989; 132: 266-269Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Radiolabeled S. purpuratus spicule matrix protein was isolated from micromeres cultured in seawater with 4% horse serum and [S]methionine. The isolation and culture of micromeres was done essentially as described by Benson et al.(30.Benson S. Smith L. Wilt F. Shaw R. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The micromeres isolated from about 2 × 106 16-cell embryos were cultured in four 100-mm Petri plates, each containing 10 ml of seawater containing 4% horse serum that had been dialyzed against seawater. Two hundred μCi of [S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) were added to each plate just prior to the onset of spiculogenesis and left in the medium until the time of harvest (24-72 h). At the conclusion of labeling, carrier spicules from whole embryos were added to the cultures, and the adherent spicules of the culture were scraped from the Petri plates. The spicules were washed with and then placed into 3.5% sodium hypochlorite overnight at room temperature. They were then washed with 5-7 changes of dHO. After the final wash, the spicules were suspended in 1 ml of dHO. An aliquot was removed to quantitate the amount of radioactivity incorporated into spicule matrix. To prepare the radiolabeled spicule matrix protein for each two-dimensional gel, 5.0 × 104 dpm of the radiolabeled spicule sample was trichloroacetic acid precipitated with 10 μg of cytochrome c carrier; this procedure dissolves the calcite and precipitates the spicule matrix protein. The pellet was then washed with acetone to remove residual trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was dried and dissolved in the appropriate sample buffer.Isolated spicule matrix proteins were labeled in vitro with biotin following the protocol described by Meier et al.(31.Meier T. Arni S. Malarkannan S. Poincelet M. Hoessli D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) using the biotinylation agent NHS-CC-biotin purchased from Pierce. The labeled proteins were localized using an enhanced chemiluminescence protocol described by Nesbitt and Horton (32.Nesbitt S. Horton M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with the exception that the blocking agent used was 0.1% fish gelatin (Amersham), 0.8% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Tween 80, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and the dilution of strepavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham) used was 1:3000.Glycosidase treatment of spicule matrix protein was carried out at 37°C overnight using endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F purchased from Boehringer Mannheim following the protocol provided by the manufacturer.Mild alkaline hydolysis β-elimination of O-linked carbohydrate moieties on spicule matrix proteins was done essentially as described by Florman and Wassarman(33.Florman H.M. Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1985; 41: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Spicule matrix proteins were incubated in 5 mM NaOH for 24 h at 37°C, neutralized with HCl, and then analyzed by Western blotting analysis as described below. Serine and threonine O-glycosidic linkages are known to be labile in alkaline conditions(34.Sharon N. Complex Carbohydrates, Their Chemistry, Biosynthesis, and Function. Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Reading, MA1975: 73-78Google Scholar).Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoretic Separation of Spicule Matrix ProteinsTwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis of spicule matrix proteins was carried out using a Bio-Rad mini-protean II two-dimensional gel apparatus. The protocol followed was essentially that described by the gel apparatus manufacturer which is based on the protocol of O'Farrell(35.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pharmolyte ampholytes with pH ranges of 2.5-4.5, 4.0-6.5, and 3-10 were used (Pharmacia). The first dimensions of the gels shown in Fig. 2, A and B, and 6A were run in the acidic direction using a blend of equal amounts of pH 2.5-4.5 and 4.0-6.5 ampholytes. The first dimensions of the gels shown in Fig. 2C and Fig. 6B were run in the basic direction using pH 3-10 ampholytes. The nonequilibrium pH gradient gels (first dimensions for Fig. 2, A and C, and 6B) were run at 750 V for 20 min. The equilibrium isoelectric focusing gels (first dimension for Fig. 2B and Fig. 6A) were run at 750 V for 2 h. The second dimensions of all two-dimensional gels and all one-dimensional gels were 10% acrylamide SDS gels as formulated by Laemmli (36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar) and modified by Dreyfus et al.(37.Dreyfus G. Adams S.A. Choi Y.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gels containing radiolabeled protein were prepared for fluorography as described by Laskey and Mills(38.Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Eur. J.

A, 0.5 μg of unlabeled spicule matrix protein was separated in the first dimension on an isoelectric focusing gel using ampholytes with a pH range of 2.5 to 6.5 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The second dimension was a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were subjected to Western blotting using the anti-SM30 antiserum. B, 0.5 μg of unlabeled spicule matrix protein was separated in the first dimension on a nonequilibrium pH gradient gel run in the basic direction. The pH range of ampholytes used was 3 to 10. The second dimension was a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were subjected to Western blotting analysis using the anti-SM50 antiserum.

These fusion proteins were generated by subcloning the cDNAs into the maltose-binding protein expression vector pMal-cRI (New England BioLabs). The 1.3-kilobase gt11 cDNA clone, pHS72, which encodes a truncated SM50 protein (168 amino acids of the carboxyl end of the protein)(18.Sucov H.M. Benson S. Robinson J.J. Britten R.J. Wilt F.

Benson S. Sucov H. Davidson E.H. Dev. Biol. 1991; 145: 201-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pMal-cRI vector. In addition, the 1.8-kilobase pNG7 gt11 cDNA clone, pNG7, which encodes a complete SM30 protein(22.George N.C. Killian C.E. Wilt F.H. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), was also subcloned into the EcoRI site of pMal-cRI. These engineered fusion protein plasmids were then used to transform XL-1 Escherichia coli (Stratagene). The induction of these fusion constructs, the lysis of the expressing bacteria, and the enrichment of the fusion proteins by affinity chromatography using amylose resin were done as described by the accompanying protocol provided by New England BioLabs. The only deviation was that the bacteria harboring the SM30 maltose-binding protein fusion were grown at 30°C instead of 37°C. This was done to prevent the SM30 fusion protein from becoming insoluble. The SM50 and SM30 fusion proteins were then used as immunogens in rabbits to generate polyclonal antisera following the protocol described by Harlow and Lane(39.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Sping Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The anti-SM30 antiserum was treated with ammonium sulfate and the immunoglobin fraction was collected and dialyzed as also described by Harlow and Lane(39.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Sping Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The anti-SM50 antiserum was used without further treatment.A rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against all of the spicule matrix proteins was generated following the procedure described by Benson et al.(16.Benson S.C.

Stachelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44704) Google Scholar). Chemiluminescent detection of immunoreactive proteins was done following the directions of the manufacturer (Amersham) except that 0.1% fish gelatin (Amersham), 0.8% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Tween 80, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl was used as the blocking solution. The anti-SM30 antiserum was used at a 1:2000 dilution and the anti-SM50 antiserum was used at a 1:1000 dilution for the chemiluminesence blots.Detection of immunoreactive proteins using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (BCIP/NBT) as substrate was done as described by Richardson et al.(29.Richardson W. Kitajima T. Wilt F. Benson S. Dev. Biol. 1989; 132: 266-269Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The anti-total spicule matrix antiserum was used at a 1:1000 dilution, the anti-SM30 antiserum was used at a 1:250 dilution, and the anti-SM50 antiserum was used at a 1:100 dilution for these blots.In Vitro Translation of SM30 RNA by Xenopus Oocytes and Reticulocyte LysateThe 1.8-kilobase full-length pNG7 SM30 cDNA (22.George N.C. Killian C.E. Wilt F.H. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEM4Z (Promega). This resulting plasmid was then used as a template to synthesize capped in vitro SM30 RNA using the Ambion Megascript kit by following the protocol provided by Ambion.The microinjection of the synthesized RNA into Xenopus oocytes and the collection of [S]methionine-labeled secreted proteins was done as described in Livingston et al.(28.Livingston B.T. Shaw R. Bailey A. Wilt F. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 473-480Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation of [S]methionine-labeled proteins using the anti-SM30 antiserum or its preimmune serum at a dilution of 1:100 was also done as described by Livingston et al.(28.Livingston B.T. Shaw R. Bailey A. Wilt F. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 473-480Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SM30 RNA was translated by reticulocyte lysate using the Ambion Reticulocyte Lysate kit following the protocol provided by Ambion.RESULTSEnumeration of the Spicule Matrix ProteinsTo accurately enumerate the proteins comprising the occluded integral matrix of the S. purpuratus sea urchin spicules, spicule matrix proteins were separated using high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Given their very acidic makeup, the spicule matrix proteins do not stain very strongly with conventional protein stains such as Coomassie and silver stains. To get a reasonable silver staining signal of spicule matrix proteins on a one-dimensional SDS-PAGE required loading a relatively large amount of protein. This same amount of protein loaded onto a two-dimensional gel resulted in excessive streaking of many of the spicule proteins. We also saw this excessive streaking on two-dimensional gels loaded with isolated spicule matrix proteins that were labeled in vitro with biotin and then subsequently localized using strepavidin-horseradish peroxidase based chemiluminescence. The streaking, we assume, is caused by overloading of the gel and/or the natural tendency of glycoproteins to streak on two-dimensional gels(41.Dunbar B.S. Kimura H. Timmons T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 441-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This occurrence makes it hard to enumerate reliably the different spicule matrix proteins (data not shown).We decided, alternatively, that radiolabeling the proteins with [S]methionine was a better way to visualize these proteins. We found culturing isolated micromeres in the presence of [S]methionine to be the most effective method of labeling sea urchin spicule matrix proteins. Harkey and Whiteley (43.Harkey M.A. Whiteley"

We investigated the contribution of the individual subunits to function and assembly of the membrane-bound complex. In-frame deletion mutants of fixN, fixO, and fixQ, and an insertion mutant of fixP were constructed. All mutants, except the fixQ mutant, showed clearly altered absorption difference spectra of their membranes and decreased oxidase activities, and they were unable to fix nitrogen symbiotically.

These analyses led to the following conclusions: (i) FixN and FixO are necessary for assembly of the multimeric oxidase, (ii) FixN and FixO assemble independently of FixP, and (iii) FixQ is not required for complex formation and, therefore, does not seem to be an essential subunit. The possible oxidase biogenesis pathway involves the formation of a primary core complex consisting of FixN and FixO, which allows the subsequent association with FixP to form the complete enzyme.

Terminal oxidases are the ultimate components of respiratory chains catalyzing the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water. The bacterial respiratory system is usually branched and comprises several terminal oxidases, allowing bacteria to grow at different oxygen tensions. Most of the bacterial oxidases belong to the so-called superfamily of heme-copper oxidases which is divided into two groups, the quinol oxidases and the cytochrome c oxidases (for a review, see (1.García-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. Rumbley J. Ma J. Gennis R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5587-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar)). Recently, a new type of heme-copper oxidase with regard to subunit composition and content of prosthetic groups has been discovered, the cbb-type oxidase. Genes encoding this oxidase were isolated first from several rhizobial species (2.Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3309-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3.Mandon K. Kaminsky P.A. Elmerich C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 174: 6444-6454Google Scholar, 4.Kahn D. Batut J. Daveran M.-L. Fourment J.

Meanwhile, homologous genes have also been identified in other Gram-negative bacteria(6.Thöny-Meyer L. Beck C. Preisig O. Hennecke H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 174: 705-716Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7.Schlüter A. Rüberg S. Krämer M. Weidner S. Priefer U.B. Mol. Gen.

It acts as a cytochrome oxidase, not as a quinol oxidase, and contains three major subunits: a membrane-integral b-type cytochrome (subunit I) with a low-spin heme and a high-spin heme-Cu binuclear center, and two membrane-anchored c-type cytochromes. Interestingly, there is no Cu-containing subunit, in contrast to conventional cytochrome c oxidases(8.Gray K.A. Grooms M. Myllykallio H. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3120-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9.García-Horsman J.A. Berry E. Shapleigh J.P. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In Bradyrhizobium japonicum, the fixNOQP-encoded cbb-type oxidase is expressed only under microaerobic and anaerobic conditions(2.Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3309-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The 61-kDa fixN gene product has up to 14 putative transmembrane helices and binds heme B(2.Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H.

Bacteriol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The fixO and fixP genes code for membrane-anchored c-type cytochromes of 28 and 32 kDa, respectively. FixO is a monoheme cytochrome c and FixP probably a diheme cytochrome c. FixQ is a 54-amino-acid polypeptide that is thought to be membrane-bound by its hydrophobic N-terminal half. Having a K for O as low as 7 nM, the B. japonicum cbb-type oxidase supports respiration under oxygen-limiting conditions and is, therefore, required for nitrogen fixation in symbiosis with soybean (Glycine max L. Merr)(2.Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Correct folding and assembly of the individual subunits of a multimeric membrane protein complex may involve a specific nucleation and a precise pathway. Little is known about the assembly of oxidase complexes in bacteria. Minagawa et al.(13.Minagawa J. Mogi T. Gennis R.B. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2096-2104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the absence of the Escherichia coli cyoABCD gene products when only one of the subunit genes was deleted. Studies on assembly of the Paracoccus denitrificans aa-type oxidase revealed that subunit I was not present in a subunit II gene deletion mutant, whereas subunit III was not absolutely essential for the formation of a subunit I•II subcomplex(14.Steinrücke P.

Using the B. japonicum cbb-type oxidase system as an example, we attempted to elucidate the role of its individual subunits in assembly and biological function.

B. japonicum strains were grown aerobically or microaerobically at 28°C in PSY medium (2.Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations (μg/ml): spectinomycin (100); streptomycin (100); kanamycin (100); tetracycline (60); chloramphenicol (10). E. coli was grown in LB medium (18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to which antibiotics were added at the following concentrations (μg/ml): ampicillin (150); kanamycin (100); tetracycline (10).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Standard procedures were used for cloning, Southern blotting and hybridization(18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA of B. japonicum was isolated as described previously(19.Hahn M. Hennecke H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 46-52Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). DNA hybridization probes were radioactively labeled using the nick-translation technique(18.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequence analyses were performed using the chain-termination method (20.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52744) Google Scholar) and the equipment for automated DNA sequencing (Sequencer model 370A and fluorescent dye terminators from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Relevant plasmids used or constructed throughout this work are listed in Table 1. For complementation of the fixNOQP operon deletion mutant Bj4503(11.Preisig, O., Zufferey, R., Th ö ny-Meyer, L., Appleby, C. A., Hennecke, H. (1996) J. Bacteriol., in pressGoogle Scholar), we constructed plasmid pRJ4504 that contained the entire fixNOQP operon, orf141, and most of orf277 gene (see Fig. 1). The fixN in-frame deletion construct pRJ4526 lacks a 1.2-kilobase pair PvuII-NsiI fragment. To construct the fixO in-frame deletion, a 0.34-kilobase pair Eco47III fragment was excised, resulting in pRJ4518. The fixQ in-frame deletion was obtained in plasmid pRJ4528 by eliminating a 0.12-kilobase pair BsaI fragment whose ends were made blunt, and adding a XhoI linker (octamer) to regenerate the ribosome binding site of the downstream gene fixP. The plasmids pRJ4504, pRJ4526, pRJ4518, and pRJ4528 are pSUP202pol6K derivatives. All of the newly fused sites at which remote DNA was joined after in-frame deletion were confirmed by sequencing. The plasmids pRJ4526, pRJ4518, and pRJ4528 were cointegrated into the Bj4503 chromosome by homologous recombination. Tetracycline-resistant clones were selected (single crossing over) and their DNA examined by Southern blot hybridization for the correct genomic structure. In the case of Bj4526, plasmid cointegration occurred at the fixG locus, i.e. downstream of the operon deletion, whereas the plasmids pRJ4518 and pRJ4528 cointegrated within the orf277orf141 locus, i.e. upstream of the operon deletion. The lacZ gene of pNM482Xb was fused to the 7th codon of fixO at the BbsI site (made blunt) that was preceded by either an intact fixN gene or a fixN deletion (described above), resulting in pRJ4569 and pRJ4545, respectively. The fixQ′-′lacZ fusion (to the 15th codon of fixQ) was constructed by ligating at the BsaI site (made blunt) the lacZ gene of pNM481Xb(21.Göttfert M. Holzhäuser D. Bäni D. Hennecke H. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1992; 5: 308-316Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This fusion was constructed either downstream of intact fixNO genes, or downstream of the ΔfixN or ΔfixO deletions (described above), yielding pRJ4542, pRJ4543, and pRJ4550, respectively. A translational fusion of the lacZ gene of pNM481X (22.Ritz D. Bott M. Hennecke H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) to the 7th codon of fixP was generated at the EcoRI site, yielding pRJ3603. To position the fixP′-′lacZ fusion into the mutated ΔfixN, ΔfixO and ΔfixQ operons (described above), the lacZ gene of pNM481Xb (21.Göttfert M. Holzhäuser D. Bäni D. Hennecke H. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1992; 5: 308-316Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was cloned into the EcoRI site of fixP, resulting in pRJ4539, pRJ4538, and pRJ4540, respectively. Plasmids pRJ4569, pRJ4545, pRJ4542, pRJ4543, pRJ4550, pRJ4539, pRJ4538, and pRJ4540 are the respective pSUP202pol6K derivatives. All fusion sites were confirmed by sequencing. While pRJ3603 was cointegrated into the chromosome of the wild type B. japonicum 110spc4 at the fixNOQ locus, the plasmids pRJ4538, pRJ4539, pRJ4540, pRJ4542, pRJ4543, pRJ4545, pRJ4550, and pRJ4569 were cointegrated into the operon deletion mutant Bj4503 by conjugation. Tetracycline-resistant clones were selected and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. Thus, strains Bj4538, Bj4539, Bj4540, Bj4542, Bj4543, Bj4545, Bj4550, and Bj4569 were obtained that contain the corresponding plasmids integrated at the homologous position in the chromosome. MalE′-′FixO and MalE′-′FixP hybrid proteins were used as suitable antigens. The malE′-′fixO and the malE′-′fixP gene fusions (to the 7th codon of fixO and the 6th codon of fixP) were constructed at the BbsI site (made blunt) in fixO or at the EcoRI site in fixP with the malE gene of pMal-cRI plasmid, resulting in pRJ4532 and pRJ3620, respectively. The correct fusion sites were confirmed by sequencing. The MalE′-′FixO and MalE′-′FixP proteins were expressed and purified according to the instructions of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach/Taunus, Germany). The purified fractions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and the proteins were stained with 0.01% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. Gel pieces with the visualized hybrid proteins were excised and used to immunize a New Zealand White rabbit. The MalE′-′FixP antiserum was used without purification. The MalE′-′FixO antiserum was purified following the method of Smith and Fischer(23.Smith D.E. Fischer P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 99: 20Crossref Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Antiserum directed against three FixN-specific peptides (PEP1 from position 61 to 73: RYFERPAALPPAE; PEP2 from position 366 to 381: TLSGAWDKLRTDPVLR; PEP3 from position 533 to 549: RVGEAEVQMPVALQPAE) was purchased from TANA Laboratories LC. (Houston, TX). The antiserum against cytochrome c had been described previously(24.Thöny-Meyer L. James P. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10497) Google Scholar), and heme stains were performed as described previously(30.Thöny-Meyer L. Stax D. Hennecke H. Cell. 1989; 57: 683-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31.Francis R.T. Becker R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy of membrane fractions was performed as described elsewhere (32.Bott M. Bolliger M. Hennecke H. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose (Amersham Corp., Buckinghamshire, UK) or polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) filters. The samples were not boiled before loading. For the detection of FixN, proteins were blotted with a semidry blotting apparatus (Semi-Phor, Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA) with the following buffer system: the cathode buffer contained 25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine and 0.06% SDS; the anode buffer 25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine and 20% methanol. The transfer of proteins separated in a 1 mm thick gel was carried out at 0.4 mA/cm2 during 2 h. Cross-reacting proteins were detected by the biochemoluminescence method according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). Plant infection tests with soybean (G. max L. Merr) were performed as described previously (19.Hahn M. Hennecke H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 46-52Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Nitrogen fixation activity was determined by the acetylene reduction assay(33.Turner G.L. Gibson A.H. Bergersen F.J. Methods for Evaluating Biological Nitrogen Fixation. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester1980: 111-138Google Scholar). To investigate the role of each of the four genes in function and biogenesis of the multisubunit enzyme complex, we constructed in-frame deletion mutations in fixN, fixO, and fixQ and used a fixP insertion that had been generated previously (2.Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3309-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The idea was to create nonpolar mutations in the first three genes that would not affect transcription and translation of the downstream genes in the operon. In the case of fixN, 394 codons (corresponding to amino acid positions 110-504) were deleted. From fixO, 114 internal codons (corresponding to amino acid positions 85-199) were removed. In the fixQ deletion the last 39 codons of the gene (amino acid positions 16-54) were removed. To restore the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the downstream fixP gene, and to bring the fixQ stop codon in-frame, an XhoI-linker had to be inserted (see “Experimental Procedures”). All of the constructs contained the fixN promoter region (between orf141 and fixN) 2O. Preisig and J. Pleschke, unpublished results.that drives transcription of the mutated operon. The ΔfixN, ΔfixO and ΔfixQ deletion plasmids were cointegrated into the chromosome of the mutant strain Bj4503 (11.Preisig, O., Zufferey, R., Th ö ny-Meyer, L., Appleby, C. A., Hennecke, H. (1996) J. Bacteriol., in pressGoogle Scholar) in which the entire fixNOQP operon is deleted (Fig. 1). To make sure that a functional oxidase can be expressed from such cointegrates, a plasmid containing the entire wild type fixNOQP operon was also cointegrated into Bj4503. The resulting strain Bj4504 served as a positive control. Since fixP is the last gene of the operon, an aphII cassette was inserted into it, and the insertion was transferred into the wild type chromosome by marker replacement (strain Bj3618; Fig. 1). Expression of the genes downstream of the in-frame deletions was tested. The fixNOQfixP′-′lacZ fusion plasmid (pRJ3603) was cointegrated at its homologous site into the chromosome of the wild type, whereas all other fusion plasmids (Table 2) were cointegrated at their homologous sites into the chromosome of the operon deletion strain Bj4503. Thus, expression of the fixO′-′lacZ fusion was tested cotranscriptionally with either an intact fixN gene or the ΔfixN deletion. Expression of the fixQ′-′lacZ fusion was tested cotranscriptionally with fixNO, ΔfixNfixO, or fixNΔfixO. Expression of the fixP′-′lacZ fusion was tested cotranscriptionally with fixNOQ, ΔfixNfixOQ, fixNΔfixOfixQ, or fixNOΔfixQ. β-Galactosidase activity of microaerobically grown cells was measured because the fixNOQP operon was found to be maximally expressed under microaerobic growth conditions (data not shown). Table 2 shows that the fixO′-′lacZ, fixQ′-′lacZ, and fixP′-′lacZ fusions were expressed to a similar extent. Thus, the in-frame gene deletion mutations ΔfixN, ΔfixO, and ΔfixQ neither disturbed transcription nor translation of the downstream genes. Notably, the fixP′-′lacZ fusion in the ΔfixQ mutant led to a similar β-galactosidase activity as that in the wild type, proving that the reconstructed fixP ribosome binding site was functional. The results from these experiments allowed us to conclude that the single-gene mutants were suitable tools to study the role of the individual gene products in respiration and complex assembly.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab We first looked for the presence or absence of cbb-type oxidase subunits in the ΔfixN, ΔfixO, ΔfixQ, and fixP::aphII mutants by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2), using antibodies specific for FixN, FixO, and FixP (see “Experimental Procedures”). B. japonicum cells were grown microaerobically, and membrane fractions were isolated. The cross-reaction of blotted membrane proteins with immunoglobulins specific for FixN or FixO gave an identical pattern (Fig. 2): the FixN and FixO proteins were present in the wild type (lane 2), in the complemented strain with the entire fixNOQP operon (lane 4), and in the ΔfixQ and fixP::aphII mutants (lanes 7 and 8). By contrast, they were absent in the operon deletion mutant (lane 3), and in the ΔfixN and ΔfixO mutants (lanes 5 and 6). In no case was FixN protein present while FixO protein was absent, or vice versa. The FixP protein pattern behaved in the same way, except that FixP was also absent in the fixP::aphII mutant. Antibodies directed against the membrane-bound cytochrome c were used as a positive control to check if similar amounts of protein were loaded from each strain. Cytochrome c was indeed detected in about the same amounts in all strains except in the bc mutant (lane 1). Interestingly, FixN, FixO, and FixP were present at normal levels in this mutant, indicating that the cytochrome bc complex is not required for the presence of the cbb oxidase in membranes. The membrane protein fractions of the same strains were also tested for heme C incorporation into the FixO or FixP proteins. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained for covalently bound heme. Again, the complemented strain served as a positive control. Heme staining revealed four membrane-bound cytochromes c (Fig. 3, lanes 2, 4, and 7): a strongly staining 32-kDa protein that had been identified previously as FixP, the diheme cytochrome c(2.Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3309-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and which was also seen in the bc mutant (lane 1); the 20-kDa CycM protein (32.Bott M. Bolliger M. Hennecke H. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34.Bott M. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6766-6772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was present in all of the strains (lanes 3, 5, 6, and 8 included), except in the bc mutant (lane 1); the 28-kDa FixO protein (lanes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8; the lower of two bands) which almost comigrates with cytochrome c (lanes 2-8; the upper of the two bands). A comparison between the Western blot (Fig. 2) and heme staining analyses (Fig. 3) clearly showed that the upper band of the 28-kDa double band must be attributed to cytochrome c, whereas the lower one represents FixO. This finding is corroborated by the fact that the 28-kDa heme staining double band was completely missing in a bc/fixO double mutant (data not shown). The presence or absence of FixO and FixP in heme stains completely concurred with their presence or absence in Western blots. Hence, heme C is covalently bound to FixO and FixP in the complemented strain, the bc mutant, and the ΔfixQ mutant; in addition, FixO is also detectable in the fixP::aphII mutant. The presence of heme B in the oxidase was investigated spectroscopically. Solubilized membrane fractions were used in these experiments. As shown in previous work(11.Preisig, O., Zufferey, R., Th ö ny-Meyer, L., Appleby, C. A., Hennecke, H. (1996) J. Bacteriol., in pressGoogle Scholar), peaks characteristic for cytochrome b at 558 nm and for cytochrome c at 552 nm were detected in wild type membranes of microaerobically grown cells. The interpretation of dithionite-reduced minus air-oxidized difference spectra of membranes is somewhat complicated by the fact that a number of different b- and c-type cytochromes are present whose absorption maxima overlap in the range of 550 to 560 nm. The spectrum of the operon deletion mutant complemented with the entire fixNOQP operon looked very similar to a wild type spectrum (Fig. 4; Bj4504). The mutants showed either weak (Bj4528 ΔfixQ), intermediate (Bj3618 fixP::aphII) or severe defects (Bj4503 ΔfixNOQP, Bj4526 ΔfixN, Bj4518 ΔfixO) in cytochrome b and c contents. The spectra of the ΔfixN and ΔfixO mutants were almost identical to those of the operon deletion mutant, with a strong decrease and a slight red shift of the cytochrome c peak and a partial decrease of b-type cytochromes. The cytochrome b-specific shoulder was resolved in these mutants into two components, one at 558 nm and the other at 563 nm. The shape of the ΔfixQ mutant spectrum was similar to that of the wild type; however, the cytochrome c peak appeared somewhat decreased. The fixP::aphII mutant exhibited a spectrum with almost normal amounts of cytochrome b, but strongly decreased levels of cytochrome c. The results indicate that the B-type hemes of FixN were present in the ΔfixQ and fixP::aphII mutants. In summary, the results from Western blots, heme stains and visible light spectroscopy implied that (i) complementation of an operon deletion with the wild type fixNOQP operon was successful; (ii) FixN, FixO and FixP were absent in the ΔfixN and ΔfixO mutants; (iii) the ΔfixQ mutation had no effect on the presence of the FixN, FixO and FixP subunits except perhaps a slight reduction in the amount of FixP (Fig. 2, lane 7, and the difference spectrum in Fig. 4); and (iv) FixN and FixO, but not FixP, were present in the fixP::aphII mutant. The functional consequences of the different mutations on respiration was tested by using TMPD as an artificial electron donor to measure cytochrome c-dependent oxidase activity from microaerobically grown cells with an oxygen electrode (Table 3). The ΔfixQ strain had a similar TMPD oxidase activity as the wild type. The operon deletion mutant (Bj4503) showed a 25% residual oxidase activity, indicating that the cbb oxidase is responsible for about 75% of the total oxidase activity present in cells grown under microaerobic conditions. The ΔfixN, ΔfixO and the fixP::aphII mutants also showed decreased oxidase activities (18, 24.5, and 38%, respectively, as compared with the wild type). The fixP::aphII insertion mutant consistently had a slightly higher oxidase activity than the ΔfixN and ΔfixO deletion mutants. It thus appeared as if the FixN and FixO subunits alone are responsible for a small amount of TMPD oxidase activity. Interestingly, the cytochrome bc mutant showed almost wild type activity, suggesting that in the absence of the bc complex, the cbb-type oxidase can still oxidize TMPD as a substrate. In addition to the tests shown in Table 3 we measured cytochrome c oxidase activity with reduced horse heart cytochrome c as electron donor, and similar results as with TMPD were obtained (not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab As shown previously(2.Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3309-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), the cbb-type oxidase is essential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation because it supports energy conservation under the extremely microaerobic conditions that prevail in soybean root nodules. Thus, we analyzed the ability of the single-gene deletion mutants to fix nitrogen in symbiosis (Fix phenotype; Table 3). Soybean seedlings were inoculated with the B. japonicum mutant strains, and nitrogenase activity was measured as acetylene reduction activity 23 days after infection. While the fixNOQP strain and the ΔfixQ mutant were Fix, the ΔfixN, ΔfixO and fixP::aphII mutants showed between 0 and 5% residual Fix activity. Nodules infected with the latter mutant strains were greenish inside, indicating the absence of functional leghemoglobin. Our results suggest that the FixN, FixO and FixP proteins, but not the FixQ protein, are essential to energetically support nitrogen fixation in root nodules. To study the pathway for assembly of multisubunit membrane complexes is inherently difficult. Lack of a single subunit often causes complete absence of the entire complex because membrane proteins may be rapidly degraded unless they find their correct partner subunit(s) to become stabilized by protein-protein interaction. For examples, the assembly of the FF-ATPase of E. coli relies on the presence of both α and β subunits (35.Cox G.B. Gibson F. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1987; 15: 163-175Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and cytochrome c of the Rhodobacter capsulatus and P. denitrificans ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase is required to maintain the stability of the other two subunits (cytochrome b, Rieske iron sulfur protein)(27.Gerhus E. Steinrücke P. Ludwig G. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2392-2400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Davidson E. Ohnishi T. Tokito M. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3351-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we report on studies to elucidate how assembly of the B. japonicum cbb-type cytochrome oxidase takes place. The approach was to knock out separately each of the four genes in the fixNOQP operon, and then we assessed the presence or absence of the other gene products in the cytoplasmic membrane. It was mandatory to construct in-frame deletions and ensure that genes located downstream of the deleted gene were expressed at normal levels. In fact, none of the deletions showed any polarity effects on the downstream genes. The mutations analyzed here affected cytochrome cbb formation to different extents, allowing us to draw conclusions with respect to subunit composition, function and assembly. Surprisingly, the ΔfixQ mutation did not cause any severe deficiencies even though (i) a fixQ-like gene is conserved in all organisms examined for the presence of fixNOQP-like operons (2.Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3309-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3.Mandon K. Kaminsky P.A. Elmerich C. J.

Microbiol. 1994; 174: 705-716Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and (ii) fixQ was shown here to be transcribed and translated. Hence, it is clear that the 54-amino acid FixQ protein is not essential for the formation and function of the cbb oxidase complex. However, this does not exclude the possibility that FixQ is bound to the oxidase, perhaps even in substoichiometric amounts. The question of whether or not FixQ is part of the complex will be answered only when substantial quantities of highly purified cytochrome cbb have become available. The partially purified oxidase preparation reported recently (11.Preisig, O., Zufferey, R., Th ö ny-Meyer, L., Appleby, C. A., Hennecke, H. (1996) J. Bacteriol., in pressGoogle Scholar) was not of sufficient quantity to identify a protein of the expected molecular mass of FixQ, i.e. approximately 6 kDa. In this context, we find it intriguing that the recent three-dimensional structure determination of P. denitrificans cytochrome aa has uncovered the presence of an unprecedented 60-amino acid peptide whose functional role is also not known(37.Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). The FixN and FixO proteins, as opposed to FixQ, are absolutely essential for the function and assembly of cytochrome cbb. Neither FixN and FixO nor the FixP protein were detectable in membranes isolated from ΔfixN and ΔfixO mutants. This supports previous biochemical data obtained with purified cbb oxidase from B. japonicum and two Rhodobacter species (8.Gray K.A. Grooms M. Myllykallio H. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3120-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9.García-Horsman J.A. Berry E. Shapleigh J.P. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B.

Bacteriol., in pressGoogle Scholar) which showed that it is a three-subunit enzyme complex consisting of FixN-, FixO-, and FixP-like proteins. Interestingly, in the B. japonicum fixP insertion mutant we detected almost wild type levels of the FixN and FixO proteins, whereas only FixP itself was absent. Moreover, the mutant had wild type levels of cytochrome b, but a decreased level of cytochrome c probably due to the absence of FixP. Notably, FixO was shown by heme-staining after SDS-PAGE to be present as mature holocytochrome c in the fixP mutant. The results are reminiscent of studies with the cytochrome bc complex, in which cytochromes b and c were still detectable in a mutant defective in the gene for the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (36.Davidson E. Ohnishi T. Tokito M. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3351-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results led us to propose an ordered biogenesis pathway for the cbb-type cytochrome oxidase. After translation of the individual subunit polypeptides from the fixNOQP mRNA, FixN and FixO are probably the first to be inserted into the membrane to form an apparently stable FixNO core complex. This primary nucleation step occurs also in the absence of FixP and, therefore, precedes assembly of the FixNO core with the FixP protein. The fact that not even traces of FixN plus FixP and FixO plus FixP are detectable in ΔfixO and ΔfixN mutants, respectively, suggests that the subunits are degraded extremely rapidly when assembly in the membrane is not possible for lack of cognate, stabilizing protein partners. In the aerobic respiratory chain of B. japonicum the bc complex appears to be a nucleation center for the formation and stable maintenance of the subsequent electron transport cytochromes CycM and aa, which are thought to be organized in a bc•CycM•aa supercomplex(24.Thöny-Meyer L. James P. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5001-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30.Thöny-Meyer L. Stax D. Hennecke H.

By contrast, the FixNOP proteins do assemble also in the absence of, and therefore independently from, the bc complex. The phenotypical analyses of the mutants also help toward understanding the organization of the microaerobic electron transport chain in B. japonicum. It is now well established that under microaerobic conditions electrons are transferred from ubiquinol to the bc complex that is also used in the aerobic respiratory chain(30.Thöny-Meyer L. Stax D. Hennecke H. Cell. 1989; 57: 683-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32.Bott M. Bolliger M. Hennecke H. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Fix phenotype of a fixNOQP mutant has been interpreted to mean that the oxidase encoded by these genes participates in the microaerobic branch of respiratory electron transport(2.Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3309-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This is strongly supported by the high affinity for O (K = 7 nM) of this oxidase(11.Preisig, O., Zufferey, R., Th ö ny-Meyer, L., Appleby, C. A., Hennecke, H. (1996) J. Bacteriol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Moreover, the structural predictions made for the FixN protein imply that it corresponds to a heme-copper oxidase subunit I, the component where oxygen is reduced. The two other components, FixO and FixP, are likely to mediate electron transfer between the bc complex and the FixN oxidase subunit. Midpoint redox potentials have been determined for subunits of the homologous R. capsulatus cbb-type oxidase. Values of 265 mV and 320 mV were determined for the 32- and 28-kDa c-type cytochromes, the ccoP and ccoO gene products(8.Gray K.A. Grooms M. Myllykallio H. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3120-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9.García-Horsman J.A. Berry E. Shapleigh J.P. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). CcoP, and by analogy FixP, is therefore likely to mediate electron transfer between the bc complex and CcoO (FixO). This would be a role comparable to that of the membrane-bound CycM protein in the aerobic respiratory branch of B. japonicum(32.Bott M. Bolliger M. Hennecke H. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34.Bott M. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6766-6772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since FixO is closely associated with FixN, it is the best candidate to donate the electrons directly to FixN. In the case of the microaerobic respiratory branch, the electrons may be transferred from the bc complex to FixP, and from there to FixO and FixN, where they are finally used for the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. We are grateful to R. Fischer for his help with antibody production, and to P. Künzler for constructing pSUP202pol6K."

Sequence comparison of FEN-1 with XPG family proteins revealed that two regions of the protein sequences are conserved (Carr et al., 1993; MacInnes et al., 1993; Scherly et al., 1993). The in vitro activity of the flap endonuclease has been found in the human XPG nuclease (Cloud et al., 1995).

When four bacteriophage exonuclease sequences have been compared with the above exo/endonuclease domains of the DNA polymerases, five conserved regions of these two groups of nucleases were identified (Gutman and Minton, 1993). Interestingly, the sequence of human flap endonuclease has some similarities to the conserved exo/endonuclease domain of E. coli DNA polymerase I (Robins et al., 1994). Taken together, this indicates that the structure and function of this 5′ structure-specific nuclease activity are conserved among bacteria, yeasts, and mammals. In this report, we compared sequences of the two conserved regions of 8 eukaryotic FEN-1/XPG family members, 6 exo/endonuclease domains of prokaryotic DNA polymerases, and 4 bacteriophage exonucleases. We have identified eight amino acids that are restrictively conserved throughout these 18 endo/exonucleases (Fig. 1). We predict that these amino acids might be essential for substrate binding or catalysis. To test this hypothesis, we have converted these amino acids individually to alanine, expressed the mutant genes in E. coli, and purified the mutant FEN-1 proteins to near homogeneity. The mutants enzymes were characterized for their ability to recognize and cleave the flap DNA structure by a recently developed assay employing kinetic flow cytometry.1 This approach allows us to identify critical amino acids involved in DNA substrate binding and catalysis. Restriction enzymes, EcoRI, BamHI, and NcoI, and 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin solution were obtained from New England Biolabs. Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit was from United States Biochemical Corp. Expression vectors and the host E. coli strains were from Novagen (Madison, WI). All electrophoresis gels and reagents were obtained from Novex (San Diego, CA). Chelating Sepharose fast flow resin was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Protein assay kit was from Bio-Rad. All buffers and salts were molecular biology grade from Fisher Scientific. Streptavidin-coated polystyrene microspheres (6.2-μm diameter) were from Spherotech (Libertyville, IL). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled standard microspheres were from Flow Cytometry Standards Corp (San Juan, PR). Sodium fluorescein was from Sigma. Oligonucleotide substrates were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) DNA synthesizer, using nucleotide or BioTEG CPG support and nucleotide or fluorescein phosphoramidites (Glen Research, Sterling, VA). Table 1 shows the sequences of the oligonucleotides used to construct the eight site-directed mutants used in this study. The altered nucleotides are underlined. Nucleotide substitutions were incorporated at the desired locations in the cloned FEN-1 in pBluescript vector by using Chameleon Double-stranded Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene. The mutations were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing using U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase Version 2.0 kit.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The pET-FCH plasmid has been made to overexpress the wild type human FEN-1 protein as described previously.1 All of the mutated sequences described above were subcloned into pET-FCH with NcoI and BamHI sites. The resultant plasmids were transformed into the E. coli host strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Enzyme expression procedures for most of the mutant proteins were essentially the same as for the wild type. For some mutant proteins with low solubility in LB medium, a sorbitol/betaine medium was used according to Blackwell and Horgan(1991), and the expression temperature was shifted to 25°C in order to enhance solubility. All of the purification steps were carried out either on ice or in a 4°C cold room. Bacterial lysates were made by sonicating in buffer S (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mM sorbitol). The extract then was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 1 h. The recombinant proteins were purified by passing the supernatant over a Ni2+-Sepharose column under nondenaturing conditions. The column was washed extensively with buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM imidazole). Buffer A containing 60 mM imidazole was used to remove weakly bound proteins. The FEN-1 mutant proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 1.0 M imidazole. The eluted proteins were diluted 10-fold with phosphate-buffered saline (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl). The diluted proteins were dialyzed against 3 liters of phosphate-buffered saline for 12 h with 3 changes and then concentrated with polyethylene glycol powder (molecular mass = 15-20 kDa). The purity of the protein was analyzed on 10-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein was quantitated using a Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay based on the Lowry assay. Enzyme concentrations were calculated based on the protein mass measurements and an estimated molecular mass of 42.5 kDa. The flap substrate labeling, immobilization of the flap substrate to the microsphere, and calibration were carried out according to the protocol described recently.1 In a typical reaction, carried out at room temperature, 5-7 nM immobilized flap substrate was mixed in R buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) in total volume of 500 μl. The substrate alone was analyzed ˜8 s to establish a base line. The sample tube was removed from the tube holder, approximately 50 nM enzyme was added, the tube was vortexed, and sample was reintroduced to the instrument. The first time point was acquired 8-9 s after mixing. The internal clock of the FACScalibur's Macintosh acquisition computer was used to track the time parameter. The data obtained were analyzed using IDLYK, a flow cytometry data analysis program developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Time data were collected at 1024-channel resolution (500 ms/channel) and rebinned at 64-channel resolution (8 s/channel) for display. The time value for a given data point was the midpoint of the time window measured. For clarity, only every fifth data point is displayed. To test the binding activity of the catalytically inactive mutants, the mutant enzymes (150 nM) were preincubated with the immobilized flap substrate in R buffer at room temperature for 15 min. The reactions were started by adding 50 nM wild type enzyme, and flap DNA cleavage was measured as described above. The amino acid sequences of eight proteins from the XPG/FEN-1 family in mammals and yeast have been compared using the computer program DNA Star. This analysis revealed conserved regions in the N-terminal (29-114 for hFEN-1) and in the middle part (129-260 for hFEN-1) of the protein amino acid sequence as described by Murray et al.(1994). Within these two regions (218 total amino acids for hFEN-1), 39 amino acids are identical. Moreover, exonuclease domains of prokaryotic DNA polymerases have been shown to have flap endonuclease activity (Lyamichev et al., 1993). When we extended this comparison to 6 exonuclease domains of the prokaryotic DNA polymerases, including E. coli DNA polymerase I and Taq DNA polymerase and 4 bacteriophage exonucleases (Lopez et al., 1989; Beck et al., 1989; Hollingsworth and Nossal, 1991), we found that 11 amino acids are similar and 8 of them are identical among these 18 enzymes (Fig. 1, A and B). Each of these 8 charged or hydrophilic amino acids was converted to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant proteins were overexpressed to a level similar to that of the wild type enzyme (Fig. 2A). The solubility of the mutant proteins differed although most of mutant proteins were comparable to the recombinant wild type protein. The most insoluble mutant proteins (G231A and D233A) were solubilized in vivo by employing the sorbitol/betaine medium according to Blackwell and Horgan (1991). The His-6-tagged FEN-1 mutant proteins were purified from the soluble part of the total crude E. coli cell extract using a nickel-Sepharose column as shown in Fig. 2B. The purified mutant proteins migrated as wild type protein in a 10-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gradient gel. Flap endonuclease activity of the wild type and mutant proteins was screened by a flow cytometry-based assay system which has been described recently.1 Six of the eight mutant proteins (D34A, D86A, E158A, D181A, G231A, D233A) exhibited no flap endonuclease activity when the assay was carried out at a protein concentration of 50 nM (Fig. 3) or at 150 nM even after 30 min of incubation (data not shown). Conversion of an arginine at position 103 or aspartate 179 to an alanine did not affect the flap endonuclease activity compared to the wild type enzyme. Mutants with no catalytic activity are expected to have a defect in substrate binding, cleavage, or both. To examine whether an individual inactive mutant was capable of substrate binding, we performed a competition assay with the wild type enzyme. For these experiments, the inactive mutant enzymes were preincubated with the substrate at room temperature for 15 min to allow them to bind to the substrate followed by the addition of wild type enzyme and measurement of cleavage. If an inactive mutant is capable of binding to the flap substrate, it will compete with and reduce the apparent activity of the wild type enzyme. Fig. 4 shows that of the six inactive mutants, three (D34A < D86A < D181A) partially inhibit the wild type FEN-1 activity at a concentration three times higher than wild type FEN-1. By increasing the concentration of mutant enzyme, the wild type activity can be completely inhibited (data not shown) although the concentration required for complete inhibition by these three mutants are different. On the other hand, the other three catalytically inactive mutants E158A, G231A, and D233A did not inhibit the wild type enzyme activity at all under the same experimental conditions. The results are summarized in Table 2. Isolation and characterization of homologous genes from different organisms provide valuable information on structurally conserved regions that are likely to be important for protein function or for macromolecular interactions. Flap endonuclease 1 genes from human, mouse, and two yeast species constitute a highly conserved family. The encoded proteins have homologous regions with the XPG family (Carr et al., 1993; MacInnes et al., 1993; Scherly et al., 1993; Murray et al., 1994). When the comparison of these protein sequences was extended to the prokaryotic and viral proteins that exhibit exonuclease/endonuclease activities, the number of absolutely conserved amino acids is reduced to a few. In order to evaluate the roles of these evolutionarily conserved amino acids in catalysis, we changed these amino acids to alanine. FEN-1 enzyme activity was assayed with a recently developed flow cytometer-based nuclease assay. Substrate binding by catalytically inactive mutants was measured by competition against the wild-type enzyme. Table 2 summarizes the ability of eight mutant enzymes to catalyze DNA cleavage and compete with the wild type enzyme.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab These data indicate that mutation of Asp-34, Asp-86, and Asp-181 lead the enzyme to lose catalytic activity completely but retain the binding ability to the flap substrate which is on the same order as wild type substrate binding. Therefore, we propose that these amino acids are required for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Three other amino acids, Glu-158, Gly-231, and Asp-233, are important for binding of DNA substrate because their replacement by alanine leads not only to the loss of cleavage activity, but also to the loss of the ability to compete with the wild type enzyme. This indicates that the affinity of these mutants for the flap DNA substrate has been reduced several orders of magnitude relative to the wild type enzyme, and that the KD for substrate binding must be much greater than 150 nM, the concentration of mutant enzyme tested here. Mutation of Arg-103 and Asp-179 did not change activity of the enzyme. Interestingly, the amino acids constituting the active site of the enzyme (Asp-34, Asp-86, Asp-181) are all aspartate. The amino acids with a carboxyl group have been identified as components of an active site in several nucleases involved in DNA repair or recombination. The amino acids constituting the active center of the human DNA repair enzyme HAP1 have been assigned to the conserved Asp-90, Asp-219, Asp-308, and Glu-96 (Barzilay et al., 1995). Saito et al.(1995) recently identified Asp-7, Glu-66, Asp-138, and Asp-141 as the catalytic center for the RuvC Holliday junction resolvase. In most hydrolytic nucleases for which detailed structural information is available, the active site residues are required either to interact directly with a water molecule which attacks the scissile phosphate of the DNA backbone or to precisely orient two metal ions with respect to the phosphodiester backbone and the attacking water molecule (Suck and Oefner, 1986; Suck et al., 1988; Beeze and Steitz, 1991; Derbyshire et al., 1991; Volbeda et al., 1991; Weber et al., 1991; Steitz and Steitz, 1993). The requirement to bind metals or to abstract protons from a water molecule to generate a nucleophile which attacks the P-O3′ bond limits the choice of amino acid residues which can function effectively in the active site of such nucleases. Histidine residues have been implicated previously in metal binding or in the activation of water molecules, while residues with carboxylic acid side groups are commonly associated with divalent cation binding (Saenger, 1991). We recently observed a Mg2+-induced conformational change of the wild type FEN-1 enzyme studied by small angle x-ray scattering and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and this conformational change did not occur in the mutant D181A FEN-1 enzyme. 3B.

In summary, this work has combined site-directed mutagenesis and a flow cytometric nuclease assay system to study a novel structure-specific endonuclease. We have found amino acids essential for substrate binding and catalysis. The information provided here should be useful for further studies on structure and function of this enzyme and other nucleases involved in DNA repair. We thank Kieran G.

One of the interacting clones isolated encoded LXRα, a recently described human orphan nuclear hormone receptor. LXRα bound directly to PPARα, as well as to the common heterodimerization partner 9-<i>cis</i>-retinoic acid receptor (RXRα). LXRα did not form a DNA binding complex with PPARα on synthetic hormone response elements composed of direct repeats of the TGACCT consensus half-site or on naturally occurring peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) or LXRα response elements. However, LXRα inhibited binding of PPARα/RXRα heterodimers to PPREs, and coexpression of LXRα in mammalian cells antagonized peroxisome proliferator signaling mediated by PPARα/RXRα <i>in vivo</i>. These findings identify a novel partner for PPARα and suggest that LXRα plays a role in modulating PPAR-signaling pathways in the cell."

ERK3, the third member of the ERK family to be cloned(10.Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 663-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar), is 50% identical to ERKs 1 and 2 within its catalytic domain. Its cDNA from rat predicts a protein of 62 kDa with a C-terminal domain that extends 180 amino acids beyond the conserved ERK core. Given the important roles of other members of this subfamily of protein kinases in cellular regulation, it is likely that ERK3 will also have important, albeit unknown, functions.A human ERK3-related enzyme was cloned (11.Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Rigby M.R. Davis R.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that is 72% identical to rat ERK3 in the kinase domain. The tail domains of ERK3 and the ERK3-related enzyme are less similar (only 28% identical) and are unrelated over the last 65 amino acids. More recently, Flier and colleagues have found the human ERK3 homolog. It is nearly identical to rat ERK3 throughout the catalytic core as well as the tail, and appears to be alternatively spliced, generating a form that contains an additional 178 residues at the C terminus(12.Zhu A.X. Zhao Y.I. Moller D.E. Flier J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8202-8211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Southern analysis suggests at least three ERK3-related genes, supporting the idea that there are multiple ERK3-like proteins(10.Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E.

Analysis of crystal structures of several protein kinases including ERK2 suggests that this residue is involved not in catalysis but in stabilizing the structure of the C-terminal fold of the protein kinase(14.Knighton D.R.

The three-dimensional structure of a yeast casein kinase I indicates a different mechanism to stabilize the protein structure(17.Xu R.-M. Carmel G. Sweet R.M. Kuret J. Cheng X. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), suggesting that this arginine in ERK3 is compatible with its protein kinase activity. To test this directly, we expressed and immunopurified ERK3 to measure its catalytic activity.In addition, we wished to confirm the existence of ERK3 protein by examining its expression and distribution in cells and tissues. ERK3-specific antibodies demonstrated that ERK3 was widely distributed and, unlike ERK1 and ERK2, ERK3 was localized to the nucleus in the absence of serum factors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureREF52, 293, COS7, and PC12 cells were cultured at 37°C in a 10% CO atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM glutamine.

For mitogen stimulation, cells were placed in medium without serum for 18-20 h and then treated with either epidermal growth factor (100 ng/ml), phorbol myristate acetate (10 ng/ml, Sigma) or FBS (10%) for various times.Bacterial Expression and Purification of Histidine-tagged ERK3 and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST)-ERK3To express histidine-tagged ERK3 without the tail domain (ERK3ΔCt, Fig. 1A), the first 1092 bp of ERK3 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subcloned into NdeI and EcoRI sites of pET-16B (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) which encodes 10 histidines 5′ to the NdeI site. The vector harboring tagged ERK3ΔCt was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21-DE3. Bacteria were grown and induced to express protein as described(18.Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant protein was purified by adsorption to Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and eluted with a gradient of 80-250 mM imidazole in ERK purification buffer (19.Boulton T.G. Gregory J.S. Cobb M.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The fractions were collected into tubes containing dithiothreitol (DTT), EGTA, EDTA, and benzamidine to give final concentrations of 1 mM, 1 mM, 1 mM and 10 mM, respectively. Fractions were dialyzed overnight against ERK purification buffer and stored at −80°C.To express ERK3 as a GST fusion protein, oligonucleotides were used for PCR amplification of either ERK3ΔCt, or full-length ERK3 and the PCR products were subcloned into EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-KG(20.Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Expression was as described except that cultures were grown in Terrific Broth (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to an OD of 0.5-0.6 and then induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside for 12-14 h. Cells were washed once with 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 25% sucrose, and 10 mM EDTA and then lysed in 40 ml of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 3 mg/ml lysozyme. The lysates were sonicated for 2 min to shear DNA and clarified by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman Ti45 rotor. The supernatants were mixed with glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h, and the beads were washed four times with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 M KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF. GST-ERK3 and GST-ERK3ΔCt were eluted with 5 mM reduced glutathione (Sigma), dialyzed against ERK purification buffer, and stored at −80°C.Generation of Anti-ERK3 AntibodiesRabbits were immunized with hemocyanin-conjugated, synthetic peptides from the C-terminal tail or protein kinase subdomain XI of ERK3 (Fig. 1A; peptides synthesized by Clive Slaughter, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) as described(22.Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The peptide from the kinase domain, DRLTAEEALSHPYMSIY, produced antibodies in rabbits A654 and C354. The peptide from the unique C-terminal region, YPDHHENKYCDLECSH, produced antibodies in rabbits D175 and D176. Two other peptides from the C terminus, DNLVWRESEVNHYYEPK and PRALSDVTDEEEVQVDPRKYL, were also used to raise antibodies in pairs of rabbits D173, D174, and A248 and Z723, respectively. Histidine-tagged ERK3ΔCt was also used as antigen (23.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) to raise antibodies in rabbits F324 and F325. Immunospecificity was determined by preincubating the peptide antibodies with 500 μM peptide or recombinant ERK3 as appropriate. Immunoblots were developed with the Amersham Corp. ECL kit.Subcellular FractionationMinced rat tissues were resuspended in 25 ml of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M sucrose, 1 mM PMSF, and 2 mM benzamidine, disrupted by sonication, and homogenized with 3-5 strokes of a Teflon-glass motorized homogenizer. Lysates were filtered through cheesecloth, layered over 10-ml cushions of the above buffer, and sedimented at 24,000 rpm in a Beckman SW28 rotor for 30 min at 4°C. Nuclear extracts were prepared by solubilizing the nuclear pellet in 1 ml of nuclear extraction buffer (see below) for 30 min, and sedimenting insoluble material at 60,000 rpm in a Beckman 70.1 rotor for 1 h.COS7 and Jurkat T cells were fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions as described(24.Chen R.-H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were extracted with nuclear extraction buffer (0.42 M NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mMp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Equal amounts of protein from each fraction were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by immunoblotting with anti-ERK3 antibodies.Protein Kinase AssaysAutophosphorylation of ERK3 was performed in 30 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 μM ATP ([-P]ATP to achieve 5-15 cpm/fmol), 10 mM MgCl, 1 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM DTT at 30°C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped with 5 × electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography(26.Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Gregory J.S. Slaughter C. Moomaw C. Hsu J. Cobb M.H. Science. 1990; 249: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of potential substrates by ERK3 was assayed as described(18.Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C. Ebert D.

Each mutant was sequenced in its entirety to ensure that only the desired mutation had been introduced. The ERK3 mutants were expressed in bacteria and mammalian cell lines by subcloning into the appropriate vectors as described for wild type ERK3 above.Transfection, P Labeling, and Immunoprecipitation of ERK3To express ERK3 in mammalian cell lines, ERK3 or ERK3ΔCt were subcloned into NheI and XhoI sites of pCEP4-HA (kindly provided by Tom Geppert, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; (28.Whitehurst C.E.

Transfection was effected with calcium phosphate or DEAE-dextran(21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Science. 1990; 249: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) for 1 h prior to addition of [P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml) for 2 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in ERK lysis buffer supplemented with 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 3 mM MgCl, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 4°C. After centrifugation for 30 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, the cell lysates were incubated with 2 μl anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (BabCo) and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) for 2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 20 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM EGTA, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS; twice with 0.5 M LiCl, 0.1 M Tris•HCl, pH 7.5; and once with 50 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 M NaCl. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Other MethodsProtein concentration was assayed using the method of Lowry(30.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis and peptide mapping were performed as described(31.Robbins D.J. Cobb M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).RESULTSDetection of ERK3 by ImmunoblottingTo identify ERK3, we generated antibodies to one peptide from subdomain XI of the catalytic core, three peptides within the 22 kDa of the enzyme that lies C-terminal to the catalytic domain (Fig. 1A), as well as to recombinant protein. All of the resulting antisera specifically recognized a protein of the same size, 62 kDa, in whole cell extracts from 293, PC12, Jurkat, 3T3, COS, Rat1, REF52, and P19 cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Recognition was blocked by preincubation of the antisera with the antigenic peptides (data not shown). The peptide from subdomain XI was 70% identical to comparable regions of ERK1 and ERK2; high concentrations of these 43- and 41-kDa proteins were sometimes detected. Although two of the peptide antigens from the C-terminal domain are also contained in the ERK3-related kinase, one of these peptide antigens is from a unique region present only in ERK3 (see Fig. 1A). Thus, ERK3 was distinguished from the related kinase, because of differences in sequence of the C-terminal domains that extend past the catalytic core. The two ERK3-specific antisera, D175 and D176, recognized a protein of the same size as the other ERK3 antibodies, indicating that the immunoblotting signal is derived from ERK3, not the related kinase.We examined the distribution and relative abundance of ERK3 in rat tissues using antisera D175 and A654, the latter an anti-ERK3 peptide antibody to subdomain XI. All tissues contained an immunoreactive band of 62 kDa, corresponding to ERK3 that were recognized by both antibodies (Fig. 2). A654 also revealed a significant band slightly smaller than ERK3 with a distinct tissue distribution, as well as minor bands of 43 and 41 kDa, corresponding to ERK1 and ERK2, consistent with the similarity of their sequences to ERK3 in subdomain XI. Both A654 and D175 also recognized proteins of 160 and 95 kDa in rat tissues, suggesting the existence of ERK3-related proteins in these tissues. The 95-kDa protein may be the alternatively spliced form of ERK3 reported by Zhu et al.(12.Zhu A.X. Zhao Y.I. Moller D.E. Flier J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8202-8211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because it is found most highly in muscle.Figure 2Expression of ERK3 in rat tissues. Nuclear extracts from rat tissues (100 μg) were resolved on 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. D175 (1:1000 dilution) and A654 (1:2000 dilution) were used for immunoblotting. The molecular mass standards are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Localization of ERK3We examined the subcellular distribution of ERK3 by immunoblotting analysis of Jurkat T cells separated into nuclear and cytosolic fractions. Immunoblotting with the anti-ERK3 peptide antibody A654 showed that ERK3 was predominantly in the nuclear fraction of Jurkat cells with little detected in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3). In contrast, immunoblotting with the anti-ERK1 peptide antibody Y691 showed the expected result that ERK1 and ERK2 were most concentrated in the cytosol with small amounts in the nuclear fraction(22.Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Similar results were found for COS7 and PC12 cells (not shown).Figure 3Subcellular distribution of ERK1, ERK2, and ERK3 in Jurkat cells. Nuclear (N) and cytosolic (S) fractions were prepared from Jurkat cells untreated(-) or treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (+), 10 ng/ml, 20 min. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-ERK1 peptide antibody Y691 (blots ERKs 1 and 2) and anti-ERK3 peptide antibody A654 (blots ERK3 and to a lesser extent ERK1 and ERK2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The nuclear localization of ERK3 was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence with the specific anti-ERK3 peptide antibody D175. ERK3 was found in the nuclei of log phase REF52 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). The punctate, nuclear staining was blocked by preabsorbing the antibody with antigenic peptide (Fig. 4, C and D) or recombinant GST-ERK3 (data not shown). Preimmune serum detected no signal in these cells (data not shown). Similar results were also obtained with several other cell lines, including COS, NIH3T3, Rat1, Jurkat, and P19 cells. In quiescent cells and cells stimulated to activate MAP kinase activity, ERK3 was also largely in the nucleus (Fig. 4, E and F). For comparison, the subcellular localization of ERK1 and ERK2 was examined with antibody Y691. In quiescent cells, ERK1 and ERK2 were predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4G); after 10 min of serum stimulation, they accumulated in and around the nucleus (Fig. 4H) (24.Chen R.-H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) although they were also clearly visible in the cytoplasm.Figure 4Immunofluorescent localization of ERK3 in REF52 cells.

Exposures for panels B, D, and E-H were 15 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The C-terminal tail of ERK3 has several standard nuclear localization sequences that might account for its constitutive presence in the nucleus. To determine if the C-terminal domain was responsible for the nuclear localization of ERK3, both the full-length protein and ERK3 lacking the C-terminal 180 amino acids, ERK3ΔCt, were expressed in COS7 cells. The transfected cells were examined by immunofluorescent staining with the anti-Myc peptide monoclonal antibody 9E10 and immunoblotting with anti-ERK3 antibody A654 after cell fractionation. Immunostaining showed that, like the endogenous protein, Myc-ERK3 was found primarily in the nucleus of the transfected cells (Fig. 5A); Myc-ERK3ΔCt was also detected in the nucleus as well as scattered in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B). Immunoblotting of subcellular fractions also showed that endogenous ERK3 and both transfected Myc-ERK3 and Myc-ERK3ΔCt were predominantly in the nuclear fractions (Fig. 5C).Figure 5The nuclear localization of ERK3 is independent of its C-terminal region. Both pCMV5-Myc-ERK3 and pCMV5-Myc-ERK3ΔCt plasmids were transiently transfected into COS7 cells. A, Myc-ERK3; B, Myc-ERK3ΔCt detected in transfected cells with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10.

The prominent band at 62 kDa in the nuclear fractions is endogenous ERK3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Protein Kinase Activity of ERK3Recombinant GST-ERK3 expressed in bacteria, endogenous ERK3 immunoprecipitated by anti-ERK3 antibodies, and transfected HA-ERK3 immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody were used to test the ability of ERK3 to phosphorylate in vitro substrates of ERK1 and ERK2. ERK3 phosphorylated none of these candidate substrates, including myelin basic protein, microtubule-associated protein-2, c-Jun, Tal1, MyoD, c-Elk, and papilloma virus protein E7, to a significant extent (data not shown). It is possible that ERK3 may require phosphorylation to display quantifiable protein kinase activity. However, lack of phosphorylation is unlikely to account for the undetectable activity of ERK3, because immunoprecipitated ERK3 was at least partly in the phosphorylated form (see below) and its activity was indistinguishable from protein expressed in bacteria. ERK3ΔCt was also expressed in bacteria and 293 cells to test a potential regulatory role of the C terminus of ERK3 on its activity. This truncated form of ERK3 also had no detectable activity with these substrates.In the absence of substrates, we tested the ability of ERK3 to autophosphorylate. Both ERK3 and ERK3ΔCt underwent autophosphorylation (Fig. 6A), confirming that ERK3 is a protein kinase. A conserved aspartate (Asp) important for catalytic activity (32.Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) was mutated to alanine to create D171A ERK3. This mutant did not autophosphorylate (Fig. 6D), ruling out the possibility that an associated kinase phosphorylated ERK3.Figure 6Autophosphorylation of ERK3.

https://openalex.org/W2016001955,"Adrenal corticosteroids have well known and profound effects on neurons and neuroendocrine cells, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study analyzed membrane currents and ACTH release in AtT20 mouse pituitary corticotrope tumor cells. Patch-clamp analysis revealed a significant and selective inhibition of calcium-activated (BK-type) potassium channels upon activation of protein kinase A by corticotropin-releasing factor or 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP. The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone had no effect on potassium currents evoked by depolarization but prevented the inhibitory effect of protein kinase A activators. The action of dexamethasone had the hallmarks of protein induction, i.e. a lag time and sensitivity to inhibitors of DNA transcription and mRNA translation. In parallel, the specific BK channel blocker iberiotoxin abolished early glucocorticoid inhibition of corticotropin-releasing factor-stimulated ACTH secretion. In summary, the present data show that glucocorticoid-induced proteins render BK-type channels resistant to inhibition by protein kinase A and that this action of the steroid is pivotal for its early inhibitory effect on the secretion of ACTH."

We have examined the function of Tβ4 in actin assembly in the high range of concentrations (up to 300 μM) at which Tβ4 is found in highly motile blood cells. Tβ4 behaves as a simple G-actin sequestering protein only in a range of low concentrations (<20 μM). As the concentration of Tβ4 increases, its ability to depolymerize F-actin decreases, due to its interaction with F-actin. The Tβ4-actin can be incorporated, in low molar ratios, into F-actin, and can be cross-linked in F-actin using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. As a result of the copolymerization of actin and Tβ4-actin complex, the critical concentration is the sum of free G-actin and Tβ4-G-actin concentrations at steady state, and the partial critical concentration of G-actin is decreased by Tβ4-G-actin complex. The incorporation of Tβ4-actin in F-actin is associated to a structural change of the filaments and eventually leads to their twisting around each other. In conclusion, Tβ4 is not a simple passive actin-sequestering agent, and at high concentrations the ability of Tβ4-actin to copolymerize with actin reduces the sequestering activity of G-actin-binding proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2075216567,"The family of type IV collagen comprises six chains numbered α1 through α6. The α3(IV) NC1 domain is the primary target antigen for autoantibodies from patients with anti-basement membrane disease and Goodpasture syndrome. Earlier peptide studies suggested that the last 36 amino acids of the α3 NC1 domain probably contains one recognition site for Goodpasture autoantibodies, and an algorithm analysis of secondary structure from a later study predicted a second possible upstream epitope near the triple helix junction. We have used several analytic approaches to evaluate the likelihood of two immunologic epitopes for the Goodpasture antigen. In our first set of studies, peptide antibodies directed against these two putative regions co-inhibited Goodpasture autoantibodies binding to denatured human α3(IV) NC1 monomer by nearly 80%, with the helix-junction region of the α3 NC1 domain contributing 26% of the binding sites and the C-terminal region contributing the remaining 50%. Second, both of these candidate regions are normally sequestered within the associated α3(IV) NC1 hexamer but become more visible for binding by anti-peptide antibodies upon their dissociation, a property that is shared by the Goodpasture autoantibodies. Third, segment deletions of recombinant α3 NC1 domain further confirmed the presence of two serologic binding sites. Finally, we looked more closely at the C-terminal binding region of the α3(IV) NC1 domain. Since the lysines in that region have been previously advanced as possible contact sites, we created several substitutions within the C-terminal epitope of the α3 NC1 domain. Substitution of lysines to alanines revealed lysines 219 and 229 as essential for antibody binding to this distal site; no lysines were present in the NC1 part of the helix-NC1 junction region. Substitutions involving arginine and cysteines to alanines in the same C-terminal region did not produce significant reductions in antibody binding. In summary, our findings characterize two Goodpasture epitopes confined to each end of the α3 NC1 domain; one is lysine-dependent, and the other is not. We propose, as a hypothetical model, that these two immunologically privileged regions fold to form an optimal pathogenic structure within the NC1 domain of the α3 chain. These sites are subsequently concealed by NC1 hexamer assembly of type IV collagen."
https://openalex.org/W2161401873,"The biochemical role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on internucleosomal DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis was investigated in HL 60 human premyelocytic leukemia cells. It was found that UV light and chemotherapeutic drugs including adriamycin, mitomycin C, and cisplatin increased poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins, particularly histone H1. A poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, 3-aminobenzamide, prevented both internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and histone H1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in cells treated with the apoptosis inducers. When nuclear chromatin was made accessible to the exogenous nuclease in a permeabilized cell system, chromatin of UV-treated cells was more susceptible to micrococcal nuclease than the chromatin of control cells. Suppression of histone H1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by 3-aminobenzamide reduced the micrococcal nuclease digestibility of internucleosomal chromatin in UV-treated cells. These results suggest that the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 correlates with the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation during apoptosis mediated by DNA damaging agents. This suggestion is supported by the finding that xeroderma pigmentosum cells which are defective in introducing incision at the site of DNA damage, failed to induce DNA fragmentation as well as histone H1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation after UV irradiation. We propose that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 protein in the early stage of apoptosis facilitates internucleosomal DNA fragmentation by increasing the susceptibility of chromatin to cellular endonuclease.

INTRODUCTIONApoptosis is an active form of cellular suicide, a process that typically involves morphological changes such as the condensation of chromatin into clumps, nuclear fragmentation, and packaging of nuclear fragments into membrane-enclosed apoptotic bodies. These morphological changes are usually accompanied by biochemical changes including elevation of cytoplasmic Ca and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation(1.Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6696) Google Scholar). Many of the chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation which cause DNA damage are known to induce apoptosis(2.Sellins K.S. Cohen J.J.

It is well established that a variety of DNA damaging agents lower the cellular NAD content by raising the specific activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1The abbreviations used are: PARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase3-AB3-aminobenzamideXPxeroderma pigmentosumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.(EC 2.4.2.30) that results from the conformational changes which occur when the zinc finger domains of the enzyme bind to the DNA strand breaks(6.Ikejima M.

PARP is a nuclear enzyme which transfers the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD to nuclear proteins including PARP itself and histones in cells(8.Kreimeyer A. Wielckens K. Adamietz P. Hilz H. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1986; 155: 19-25Google Scholar) are the substrates of PARP. Thus, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has been implicated in many biological responses including DNA replication(14.Shall S. FEBS Lett. 1972; 24: 1-6Crossref Google Scholar), DNA excision repair(15.Durkacz B.W. Omidiji O. Gray D.A. Shall S.

Basic Life Sci. 1990; 52: 225-232PubMed Google Scholar).In recent years, the role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the cell death process has been discussed. The decrease in cellular PARP activity during the course of radiation-induced apoptosis in rat thymocytes was reported by Nelipovich et al.(18.Nelipovich P.A. Nikonova L.V. Umansky S.R. Int. J. Ratiat. Biol. 1988; 53: 749-765Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of PARP activity in cells undergoing apoptosis was supported by the finding that C-nitroso compounds that inhibit PARP function provoke apoptosis in cultured mammalian cells(19.Rice W.G. Hillyer C.D. Harten B. Schaeffer C.A. Dorminy M. Lackey III, D.A. Kirsten E. Mendeleyev J. Buki K.G. Hakam A. Kun E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7703-7707Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). On the contrary, many studies proposed that the activation of PARP contributes to the induction of apoptosis. PARP activation was recognized during the cell death processes induced by DNA damaging agents such as alkylating agents(3.Marks D.I. Fox R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), HO(20.Schraufstatter I.U. Hinshaw D.B. Hyslop P.A. Spragg R.G. Cochrane C.C. J. Clin.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar) attempted to explain these controversial results by suggesting that early during the course of apoptosis the activity of intact PARP is stimulated by DNA strand breaks, but proteolytic cleavage decreases the activity of PARP in the late course of apoptosis.Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins is one of the most dramatic post-translational modifications that occur during apoptosis. The potential correlation between poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins and apoptotic internucleosomal DNA fragmentation has been suggested(25.Jones D.P. McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6398-6403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Bertrand R. Solary E. Jenkins J. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell. Res. 1993; 207: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These studies have described the suppressive effect of PARP inhibitors on the generation of DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis. However, the target protein of PARP during apoptosis or the biochemical mechanism by which poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation affects the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation has not been addressed. In the present study, a correlation was found between internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 nuclear protein during apoptosis mediated by DNA damaging agents. We propose that the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 that occurs early during the course of apoptosis facilitates oligonucleosomal DNA fragmen-tation by increasing the susceptibility of nuclear chromatin to cellular endonuclease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsNicotinamide, 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), thymidine, cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum[II]), adriamycin, histone H1, and micrococcal nuclease were purchased from Sigma. Mitomycin C was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. [Adenylate-P]NAD was from Amersham. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.Cell Lines and Culture ConditionsThe HL 60 cell line was from American Type Culture Collection and was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) cell line (complementation group A, GM04312B) was obtained from Nigms Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ) and was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.Measurement of PARP ActivityPARP activity was measured by the method of Grube et al.(27.Grube K. Kupper J.H. Burkle A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After induction of apoptosis, cells were permeabilized (2 × 106 cells/ml) in ice-cold permeabilizing buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA, 30 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 4 mM MgCl. Cell suspension was incubated for 15 min at 4°C. Aliquots of 107 cells were then collected by centrifuging at 200 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 0.2 ml of permeabilizing buffer. To this permeable cell suspension, 0.1 ml of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase reaction buffer containing 100 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 120 mM MgCl, 1 mM NAD, and 10 μCi/ml [P]NAD was added. After incubation at 30°C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and 2% sodium pyrophosphate, and acid insoluble radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman, LS 3801).Examination of DNA FragmentationThe apoptotic nature of cells was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis of their nuclear DNA, using the method of Warning(28.Waring P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14476-14480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The quantification of DNA fragmentation was carried as described by McConkey et al. (29.McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Jondal M. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13399-13402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells treated with apoptosis inducer in a 100-mm culture dish were lysed in 0.33 ml of a buffer containing 5 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA, and 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100. After incubation for 15 min on ice, samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 27,000 × g to separate the intact chromatin (pellet) from the fragmented DNA (supernatant). Pellets were resuspended in 0.33 ml of a buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA. Pellet and supernatant fractions were separately assayed for DNA content using the diphenylamine reagent containing 1.5% diphenylamine (w/v), 1.5% sulfuric acid (v/v), and 0.008% acetaldehyde (v/v) in glacial acetic acid(30.Burton K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (10819) Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation was quantified by measuring the ratio of the DNA content in supernatant fraction to the total (supernatant plus pellet) DNA content. For visualization of fragmented DNA, the supernatant fraction containing fragmented DNA was extracted once with an equal volume of phenol and once with chloroform, precipitated in 67% ethanol, 0.3 M sodium acetate at −20°C for 18 h, and then resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 30 μg/ml RNase A, prior to electrophoresis in 1.8% agarose gel as described by Jones et al.(25.Jones D.P. McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6398-6403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Analysis of the Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of Histone H1Cells were permeabilized for the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction as described earlier, and histone H1 was extracted by a modified version of the method of Cole(31.Cole R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, perchloric acid was added to each cell sample in a 100-mm culture dish (5% final concentration). After vortexing for 3 min and centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was saved and the pellet was re-extracted with 0.15 ml of 5% perchloric acid. Supernatant fractions were pooled and adjusted to 0.1 N HCl. The supernatant fractions were mixed with 4 volumes of acetone and stirred for 16 h at 4°C. The pellet of histone H1 was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min and washed with acetone containing 0.1% HCl. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 was analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography.Micrococcal Nuclease Digestion of Nuclear DNACells were permeabilized to exogenous nuclease by the modified method of Smets et al.(32.Smets L.A. Loesberg C. Janssen M. Van Rooij H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cell preparations (107 cells/sample) either from control or UV-treated cells were permeabilized in 0.7 ml of a hypotonic buffer containing 9 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 4.5% (w/v) dextran (average M, 110,000), 1 mM EGTA, 4.5 mM MgCl, and 15 μg/ml digitonin for 20 min on ice. Ca concentration was adjusted to 2 mM and specified concentrations of micrococcal nuclease were added. The reaction mixture was then incubated for 10 min at 37°C. The DNA fragmentation was quantified by the method of McConkey et al.(29.McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Jondal M. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13399-13402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fragmented DNA by micrococcal nuclease digestion was collected for electrophoresis in 1.8% agarose gel(25.Jones D.P.

Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Cotter T.G. Lennon S.V. Glynn J.M. Green D.R.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). When HL 60 human premyelocytic leukemia cells were exposed to UV light, obvious internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was recognized by 3 h after exposure. Other chemotherapeutic drugs that induce DNA strand breaks such as adriamycin, mitomycin C, and cisplatin also induced evident internucleosomal DNA fragmentation by 9, 15, and 10 h following treatment, respectively (Fig. 1).The change of PARP activity during the course of UV-mediated apoptosis was shown in Fig. 2A. The cellular PARP activity, as measured by the transfer of P-labeled ADP-ribose moieties from NAD to cellular proteins, was elevated immediately after UV irradiation. The activity peaked at 2.5 h after UV irradiation and declined thereafter. However, the apparent increase in the amount of fragmented DNA was evident at 2.5 h after UV irradiation coinciding with the time point when the maximal PARP activity was observed. The observation of increased PARP activity before the commencement of DNA fragmentation has led us to investigate the possible involvement of PARP activation in the course of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. In Fig. 2B, we examined the effect of PARP inhibitors on DNA fragmentation induced by UV irradiation. Dose-dependent inhibition of UV-induced DNA fragmentation was observed with PARP inhibitors of 3-AB, nicotinamide, or thymidine. The internucleosomal DNA fragmentation induced by the chemotherapeutic drugs as well as UV light was completely inhibited by 3-AB, implicating a common requirement for PARP activation in the course of apoptosis mediated at least by the agents employed in this study (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the morphological changes of apoptosis were also prevented by 3-AB treatment (Fig. 3B).Figure 2A, time courses of PARP activity and DNA fragmentation during UV-induced apoptosis. HL 60 cells were irradiated with 250 J/m2 of 254 nm UV light. After incubating for specified time periods, cells were harvested and divided into two aliquots.

When cells were irradiated with 250 J/m2 of UV light and cellular proteins were analyzed for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by autoradiography following SDS-PAGE, two proteins of about 33 and 110 kDa were predominantly poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated (Fig. 4B, lane 5). The 33-kDa poly(ADP-ribose) acceptor protein had an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of histone H1 which migrates as a group of bands of apparent molecular mass 30-35 kDa(35.Lennox R.W. Cohen L.H. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 532-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 33-kDa poly(ADP-ribose) acceptor protein showed the same electrophoretic mobility as that of commercially available histone H1. Histone H1 is a major target protein modified by PARP(36.Huletsky A. Niedergang C. Frechette A. Aubin R. Gaudreau A. Poirier G.G. Eur. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and analyzed its state of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Histone H1 was markedly poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by 2 h after UV irradiation (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4A shows that the amount of histone H1 protein in the cells was not changed by UV irradiation. The increase in the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 was not a restricted phenomenon in cells undergoing apoptosis mediated by UV treatment. The treatment of cells with chemotherapeutic drugs such as adriamycin, mitomycin C, or cisplatin also resulted in an increase in the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 protein (Fig. 5). Simultaneous treatment of 3-AB with these DNA damaging agents inhibited both internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 (Fig. 3 and 5).Figure 4Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 during UV-induced apoptosis. HL 60 cells were irradiated with 250 J/m2 of UV light and incubated for 0, 1, 2, or 3 h (lanes 1-4, respectively). The P-labeled ADP-ribose moiety of NAD was attached to cellular proteins in a permeabilized cell system. Histone H1 was extracted(32.Smets L.A. Loesberg C. Janssen M. Van Rooij H. Biochim. Biophys.

Johnson R.T. Mutat. Res. 1988; 193: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Complementation group A is one of the most severe forms of this genetic disease(39.Robins P. Jones C.J.

There are reports that XP cells are defective in the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) in response to UV irradiation(40.Berger N.A. Sikorski G.W. Petzold S.J. Kurohara K.K.

In contrast to HL 60 cells, the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6A) and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 (Fig. 6C) were both abolished in XP cells treated with UV light ranging from 100 to 300 J/m2. None of the morphological characteristics of apoptotic cells were seen in XP cells after UV treatment (data not shown).Figure 6DNA fragmentation and histone H1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation after UV irradiation in HL 60 and GM04312B cells.

One aliquot was prepared for agarose gel electrophoresis (lane 1, DNA-HindIII digest; lanes 2-5, HL 60; lanes 6-9, GM04312B) (A). The other aliquot was prepared for the examination of histone H1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Histone H1 was extracted and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE.

This rationale was tested in Fig. 7 in which the chromatin DNA of intact or UV-treated HL 60 cells was examined for its susceptibility to micrococcal nuclease, an endonuclease known to cleave internucleosomal DNA(44.Nelson P.P. Albright S.C. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9194-9199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), after incubation with or without 3-AB. Chromatin DNA of HL 60 cells was examined at 2 h after 250 J/m2 UV treatment when the cellular proteins were fully poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated but DNA remained unfragmented (see Fig. 2A). Chromatin DNA of UV-treated HL 60 cells was susceptible to micrococcal nuclease digestion yielding a ratio of fragmented DNA content to total DNA content of up to 20% after 4 milliunits/ml treatment of micrococcal nuclease for 10 min (Fig. 7A). However, chromatin DNA of UV-treated cells became resistant to micrococcal nuclease digestion by 3-AB which inhibited the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histone H1 (see Fig. 5). It seems highly unlikely that the DNA fragmentation was produced by the action of endogenous endonuclease, since Fig. 7B (lane 3) demonstrates that the chromatin DNA of UV-treated cells remains unfragmented during 2 h after UV irradiation. However, the chromatin DNA becomes susceptible to the exogenous micrococcal nuclease added early during the course of apoptosis (lane 8).Figure 7Reduced susceptibility of chromatin DNA to micrococcal nuclease by 3-AB during apoptosis mediated by UV irradiation. Micrococcal nuclease digestibility of nuclear chromatin was examined in control HL 60 cells (), cells exposed to 5 mM 3-AB (▵), cells treated with 250 J/m2 of UV (•), or in cells exposed to 250 J/m2 of UV and 5 mM 3-AB (○). Cells were incubated for 2 h and were permeabilized to allow the accessibility of their chromatin to micrococcal nuclease. The measurement of DNA fragmentation was done using diphenylamine reagent as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results of a typical experiment of three replicates is shown (A). DNA fragments were analyzed by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis (B).

It is well established that the free ends of DNA are strong activators of PARP and that PARP activity is increased by DNA damaging agents which introduce DNA strand breaks(6.Ikejima M. Noguchi S.

To investigate the structural properties regulating A1 domain function, we have used recombinant fragments prepared either in cyclic form with oxidized Cys-Cys disulfide bond or reduced and alkylated. Interaction with glycoprotein Ibα was assessed by testing inhibition of monoclonal antibody LJ-Ib1 binding to platelets and inhibition of shear-induced platelet aggregation mediated by native vWF. Fragments exposed to pH between 2.5 and 3.5 adopted the molten globule conformation with loosened tertiary structure intermediate between native and completely unordered state. Maximal receptor binding activity was observed when fragments kept at acidic pH, particularly after reduction of the Cys-Cys disulfide bond, were subjected to quick refolding by rapid pH increase. In contrast, slow refolding by incremental pH change over several hours resulted in at least 20-fold lower activity. A specific single point mutation (I546V) resulted in enhanced receptor binding, whereas another mutation (S561G) caused markedly reduced binding.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2946-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); moreover, platelets adhere to vWF immobilized onto a surface(7.Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has generally been assumed that the modulation of GP Ibα binding activity involves conformational changes in vWF with exposure of functional sites normally cryptic when the molecule is in solution. In vivo, this may occur when vWF interacts with subendothelial components, like collagen(21.Pareti F.I. Niiya K. McPherson J.M. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13835-13841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where integrity of the vessel wall is disrupted. The present studies have been undertaken to test the hypothesis that conformational changes may influence the GP Ib binding function of vWF. Our results demonstrate that quick refolding following loosening of tertiary structure may lead to increased binding affinity and that single point mutations can either enhance or decrease A1 domain interaction with GP Ibα in the absence of exogenous modulators. These findings provide initial information on the mechanisms involved in the regulation of receptor recognition sites in the A1 domain of vWF. The two fragments designated rvWF and rvWF were expressed in E. coli BL21-DE3 using plasmids containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter(22.Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol.

Fragments, prepared either with reduced and alkylated or oxidized Cys residues, were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (24.Sugimoto M. Dent J. McClintock R. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12185-12192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), concentrated by solvent evaporation, dialyzed against 2 mM acetic acid titrated with HCl to pH 3.5, and stored at −70°C (or at 4°C for shorter periods of time) until used. The cDNA construct with a Cys Ala substitution at position 462, directing secretion in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells of a monomeric molecule designated rvWFC462A, has been described previously (13.Azuma H.

Secreted proteins were precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate, dissolved with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, dialyzed against the same buffer at 4°C, and purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with a 50-min linear elution gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCl. Eluted fractions that contained antigen reacting with the monoclonal antibodies LJ-RG46 and LJ-52K2 (see below) were pooled and subjected to reverse-phase chromatography on a Poros R1/H column (PerSeptive Biosystems) using a 20-min 12-70% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 2% n-propyl alcohol. The purified fragment was concentrated by solvent evaporation or reduced and alkylated (10.Andrews R.K. Gorman J.J. Booth W.J. Corino G.L. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8326-8336Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and then concentrated after repeating the reverse-phase chromatography. Finally, the fragments were dialyzed against 2 mM acetic acid titrated with HCl to pH 2.5 and stored at −70°C (or 4°C for shorter periods of time) until used. Two amino acid substitutions identified in patients with the typical phenotype of type 2B von Willebrand disease (26.Ruggeri Z.M. Pareti F.I. Mannucci P.M. Ciavarella N. Zimmerman T.S. N. Engl. J.

One of the mutations, Ile Val, has not been reported before; the other, Pro Leu, has been found in at least one family(28.Kroner P.A. Kluessendorf M.L. Scott J.P. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 1992; 79: 2048-2055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Ginsburg D. Sadler J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Moreover, we also expressed the Gly Ser mutation known to cause type B von Willebrand disease(30.Rabinowitz I. Tuley E.A. Mancuso D.J. Randi A.M. Firkin B.G. Howard M.A. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9846-9849Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a subtype of type 2M(31.Sadler J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using uracil-containing templates (32.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) derived from recombinant filamentous phage containing the normal coding sequence for rvWF and oligonucleotide primers with the desired nucleotide substitution (underlined) within the vWF noncoding strand sequence: 5′-GACCCACTTCTGGGAGACGCGCAGCCGCTCCATC-3′, changing the codon of Ile to Val; 5′-GTAGGCGTGGGAGCTGTCGTGGTACTC-3′, changing the codon of Gly to Ser; 5′-GCGCCGCAGCTCTGACAGTCGCTTCCGGTC-3′, changing the codon of Pro to Leu. Occurrence of the desired mutation was verified by sequence analysis, and the mutated fragments were then cloned and expressed in host E. coli BL21-DE3, as described above. Fragments exposed to acidic pH were returned to neutral pH either rapidly, by direct mixing with an appropriate buffer (quick refolding), or progressively, by dialysis at 4°C against 2 mM acetic acid to which an appropriate amount of ammonium hydroxide was added every 8 h to raise the pH in 0.5 unit increments (slow refolding). When the pH reached 6.5, the samples were dialyzed against 2 mM ammonium acetate titrated with ammonium hydroxide to pH 7.0. In low ionic strength buffer without NaCl, the slowly refolded E. coli-expressed rvWF was soluble at a concentration as high as 2 mg/ml, as shown by the fact that the ratio of absorbance at 280 nm over that at 320 nm (the latter is an indicator of light scattering due to aggregates) was >20. Slow refolding of the E. coli-expressed rvWF was carried out to an upper pH limit of 5.0 and a concentration of 1 mg/ml because of the tendency to precipitate. The solubility limit of the two E. coli-derived fragments was ≤0.2 mg/ml at pH 7.4 with a NaCl concentration of 150 mM. LJ-RG46 and LJ-52K2 recognize epitopes located between residues 474-488 and 694-708 of mature vWF, respectively, and react also with denatured and reduced antigen(33.Mohri H. Fujimura Y. Shima M.

NMC-4 recognizes preferentially vWF fragments comprising at least the sequence between residues 508 and 704 with an intact Cys-Cys bond(24.Sugimoto M. Dent J. McClintock R. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J.

LJ-Ib1 recognizes the 45-kDa amino-terminal domain of GP Ibα and is a competitive inhibitor of vWF binding to this receptor(34.Handa M. Titani K. Holland L.Z. Roberts J.R. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12579-12585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the mouse monoclonal antibodies (IgG) were purified by chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.)(35.Ey P.L. Prowse S.J. Jenkin C.R. Immunochemistry. 1978; 15: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). LJ-Ib1 was iodinated with NaI (Amersham Corp.) using Iodo-Gen (Pierce)(36.Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). The specific activity of I-labeled LJ-Ib1 was typically between 1 and 3 × 109 cpm/mg. Protein concentration was determined by the micro BCA method (Pierce). Purified recombinant vWF fragments were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in a 10% gel (37.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Immunoblotting with LJ-RG46 and LJ-52K2 and dot blot analysis with NMC-4 were performed as described previously(13.Azuma H. Dent J.A. Sugimoto M. Ruggeri Z.M. Ware J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12342-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Sugimoto M. Dent J. McClintock R. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12185-12192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG as second antibody. Visualization of positive bands by fluorography was obtained with the chemiluminescent substrate disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.1]decan}-4-yl) phenyl phosphate (Tropix, Bedford, MA) in 0.1 M diethanolamine, 1.0 mM MgCl, and 0.02% sodium azide, pH 10.0. The results were recorded on Kodak X-AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) exposed at room temperature for 25 min with a Cronex Lightning Plus screen (Du Pont de Nemours Inc.). Ion spray mass spectra were generated with an API I SCIEX mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer). E. coli-derived recombinant fragments were tested at a concentration of 8 μM in 1 mM ammonium acetate or 45% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were introduced into the analyzer at a rate of 4.0 μl/min. The positive ions generated by the ion evaporation process entered the analyzer through an interface plate and a 100-μm orifice whereas the declustering potential was maintained at 100 V to control the collisional energy of the entering ions. The molecular weight of molecules in solution and thus their state of aggregation was determined on the basis of the hydrodynamic radius derived from the translational diffusion coefficient measured with a dp-801 molecular size detector (Biotage Inc.). A monochromatic laser light of 780 nm wavelength from a 30 mW power source illuminated samples introduced into the measuring cell at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. The intensity fluctuations of the scattered light, due to the Brownian motion of molecules in solution, were analyzed to deduce the radii of the moving molecules using a connected digital signal processor and computer. The mammalian cell-derived fragment appeared to be soluble under all conditions tested in these studies. In contrast, the two E. coli-derived fragments were predominantly monomeric in solution at pH <3.5 but exhibited a tendency to form aggregates with increasing pH. These measurements were carried out on a Cary 61 spectropolarimeter modified by replacing the original Pockel cell with a 50 Khz photoelastic modulator (Hinds International, model FS-5/PEM-80) and the linear polarizer with a MgF linear polarizer (AVIV Inc.). A lock in amplifier (EGG Princeton Applied Research, model 128) was used to integrate the phase detected output of the original end-on photomultiplier tube and preamplifier. System automation, multiple scan signal averaging, and base line subtraction were accomplished with a computer interfaced directly with the spectropolarimeter and the amplifier. The system software and custom hardware interfaces were designed by Allen MicroComputer Services, Inc., and the Department of Chemistry Computer Facility of the University of California at San Diego. Recombinant vWF fragments were tested at a concentration of 0.5-1 μM in 2 mM acetic acid titrated with HCl to pH 2.5 (for the fragment derived from mammalian cells) or 3.5 (for the fragments derived from E. coli) or in 2 mM ammonium acetate titrated to pH 7.0 with ammonium hydroxide. Measurements were carried out in a 0.5-mm quartz cell kept at 20°C in a thermostatically controlled holder. Spectra between the wavelength limits of 185-260 nm were obtained as the average of 20 repeated measurements at 0.1-nm intervals with dynode voltage below 450 mV. After correction for spurious signals generated by the solvent according to manufacturer's instructions, spectra were expressed as mean residue ellipticities based on concentrations determined by amino acid analysis of samples (5-10 μg) subjected to acid hydrolysis. Fluorescence spectra of recombinant fragments in the same buffers described for measuring CD spectra were obtained with a Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorometer at 23°C using an excitation and emission slit width of 4 nm. Sample absorbance was maintained below 0.05 between the wavelengths of 280 and 300 nm to minimize interference from inner filter effects. Tryptophan fluorescence was selected by excitation at 295 nm to minimize the contribution of tyrosine fluorescence. The data were plotted on a Perkin-Elmer graphic plotter. Each spectrum was corrected for background fluorescence of the solvent. The inhibition of LJ-Ib1 binding to platelets can be assumed to reflect the affinity of interaction between rvWF fragments and GP Ibα in the absence of exogenous modulators(12.Sugimoto M. Ricca G.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12185-12192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blood from healthy volunteers, who were aware of the experimental nature of the research and gave their informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, was collected with D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone dihydrochloride as anticoagulant (final concentration, 46.6 μM), and platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 150 × g for 15 min. The experimental mixture (total volume, 125 μl) consisted of an aliquot of platelet-rich plasma mixed with an appropriate volume of 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, a constant volume (<12.5 μl) of various concentrations of rvWF fragment either kept in 2 mM acetic acid or slowly refolded as described above, and 10 μg/ml of I-labeled LJ-Ib1 IgG (a concentration resulting in approximately half-maximal binding to platelets) in 10 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4; the final platelet count was 1 × 108/ml. Control mixtures contained 2 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, or 2 mM acetic acid, pH 2.5 or 3.5, instead of rvWF fragment and gave the same level of LJ-Ib1 binding. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, platelets were separated by centrifugation though a layer of 20% sucrose, and bound radioactivity was measured in a -scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was estimated with the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled LJ-Ib1 and was always <10% of total binding; the corresponding value was subtracted from all data points. Binding was expressed as a percentage of that measured in the corresponding control mixture and used to calculate the concentration of rvWF fragments required to inhibit 50% of antibody binding to GP Ibα (IC). These experiments were performed with washed platelets prepared as described elsewhere (38.Goto S. Salomon D.R. Ikeda Y. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23352-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and finally resuspended in divalent cation-free HEPES-Tyrode buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.4 mM NaHPO, 10 mM NaHCO, and 5 mM dextrose), pH 7.4(39.Ruggeri Z.M. De Marco L. Gatti L. Bader R. Montgomery R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These platelets were not significantly activated by the washing procedure because they showed no increase in the expression of P-selectin, as detected by flow cytometric analysis (40.Corash L. Blood Cells. 1990; 160: 97-108Google Scholar) using the monoclonal antibody S-12 (a generous gift from Dr. Rodger P. McEver of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK). Mixtures containing washed platelets at a final count of 3 × 108/ml, 15 μg/ml of purified vWF, and the indicated concentration of rvWF fragments or the equivalent volume of the corresponding buffer in the control mixtures were exposed to shear in a computer-controlled modified cone-and-plate viscometer(41.Ikeda Y.

The final concentration of CaCl and bovine serum albumin in these mixtures was 1 mM and 5 mg/ml, respectively. Each sample was exposed to a shear rate of 120 s for 5 s, during which the light transmittance of the platelet-rich suspension (0% aggregation) was recorded; the shear rate was then linearly increased to 10,800 s in 15 s and maintained at that level for 340 s at room temperature (22-25°C). Platelet aggregation was monitored continuously and displayed as light transmittance through the suspension; data were stored at 1-s intervals and used to calculated the extent of aggregation by applying the Lambert-Beer's equation(41.Ikeda Y. Handa M. Kawano K. Kamata T. Murata M. Araki Y. Anbo H. Kawai Y. Watanabe K. Itagaki I. Sakai K. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1234-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The validity of these measurements was verified in selected cases by counting single platelets in suspension using an electronic particle counter (System 9000 Diff model, Serono Baker Diagnostics). A schematic representation of the fragments used in these studies is shown in Fig. 1. After reduction of the Cys-Cys intrachain disulfide bond, all purified fragments exhibited slower migration in SDS-PAGE and markedly reduced reactivity with the monoclonal antibody NMC-4 (Fig. 2).Figure 2SDS-PAGE and dot blot analysis of the recombinant vWF fragments. A, dot blot analysis. An aliquot of each fragment was applied onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a circular area. After drying, the membrane was treated with a solution of the anti-vWF monoclonal antibody NMC-4 (5 μg/ml) followed by fluorographic detection of the bound antibody using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Note that the antibody reacts well with the cyclic fragments containing the intact Cys-Cys disulfide bond (C) but only minimally after reduction and alkylation of Cys residues (R/A). B, SDS-PAGE analysis. Fragments were analyzed in a 10% gel under nonreducing conditions. Proteins in the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The numbers to the right indicate the molecular masses of standard proteins (in kDa). Note the slower migration and apparent size heterogeneity of the mammalian cell derived rvWFC462A as compared with the corresponding E. coli derived rvWF, composed of approximately the same number of residues. These findings are compatible with the presence of variable carbohydrate side chains in the mammalian cell derived molecule, as in native vWF(5.Fujimura Y. Titani K. Holland L.Z. Russell S.R.

The results reported here were obtained with the mammalian-derived rvWFC462A at pH 2.5, but essentially identical findings were observed with the E. coli-derived fragments at pH 3.5. The different susceptibility to the denaturing effect of increasing [H] can be explained by the protective effect of carbohydrate chains present in the mammalian but not in the bacterially derived fragments. Emission spectra of rvWFC462A reflect the presence of eight Tyr residues and a single Trp residue located at position 550 of the native vWF sequence within the Cys-Cys loop. Excitation at 280 nm demonstrated a difference in the wavelength of the light emitted with maximal intensity by the fragment kept at pH 2.5, 340 nm, as compared with the one refolded at pH 7.0, 335 nm (Fig. 3). Moreover, the fragment at low pH exhibited greater fluorescence intensity at 303 nm (Fig. 3), indicative of more efficient Tyr emission due to decreased energy transfer to the Trp residue as a consequence of increased distance. Excitation at 295 nm resulted in emission spectra dominated by the contribution of the Trp residue, with a clear difference in the wavelength of the light emitted with maximal intensity by the fragment kept at low pH, 345 nm, as compared with the one refolded at pH 7.0, 335 nm (Fig. 3). The shift to red in the emission spectrum indicates that the indole ring in the side chain of Trp is located in a more hydrophilic environment near the surface of the molecule as a consequence of conformational changes induced by acidic pH. Both cyclic and reduced and alkylated rvWFC462A maintained either at physiologic or acidic pH showed similar CD spectra, indicative of the presence of α helix as well as β strand secondary structures (Fig. 4). A slight difference in mean residue ellipticity at <205 nm in the spectrum of the fragments kept at pH 2.5, particularly after reduction and alkylation, indicated some increase in the content of unordered structure. Overall, the CD and intrinsic fluorescence spectra were typical of the molten globule intermediate between the native and the completely unfolded states(42.Ptitsyn O.B. J. Protein Chem. 1987; 6: 273-293Crossref Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The interaction of rvWF fragments with platelet GP Ib was evaluated by the ability to inhibit binding of the anti-GP Ibα monoclonal antibody, LJ-Ib1, in the absence of any exogenous modulator.

We tested the effects of cortisol on IGFBP-5 expression in cultures of osteoblast-enriched cells from fetal rat calvariae (Ob cells). Cortisol decreased IGFBP-5 polypeptide levels in the extracellular matrix and caused a time- and dose-dependent decrease in IGFBP-5 mRNA. IGFBP-5 transcripts were markedly decreased by cycloheximide, and further suppressive effects of cortisol could not be determined. Cortisol did not modify the decay of IGFBP-5 mRNA in transcriptionally arrested Ob cells. Cortisol decreased IGFBP-5 hnRNA, the rate of IGFBP-5 transcription, and the activity of the murine IGFBP-5 promoter by 35% in transient transfection experiments. Deletion analysis showed that the region responsive to cortisol is from base pairs −70 to +22, and E-box-binding proteins or c-Myb-related nuclear factors may be involved in its regulation. In conclusion, cortisol inhibits IGFBP-5 transcription in Ob cells through the Myb-binding domain. This effect may be partly responsible for the effect of glucocorticoids on bone formation.

Sci. 1989; 6: 915-926Google Scholar) but no definitive agreement exists. However, it is well established that HBL Hbs have a hexagonal symmetry and consist of two types of chains, globin-chains (17,000 Da) accounting for approximately 70% of total mass and heme-deficient linker chains (24,000-32,000 Da) necessary for assemblage into the HBL structure(7.Vinogradov S.N. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1985; 82B: 1-15Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of this molecular structure requires the knowledge of: (i) the molecular mass of the native molecule; (ii) the number and proportions of all constitutive polypeptide chains; (iii) the number and relation between subunits; and (iv) the determination of linker proportions.In a companion study (8.Zal F.

Rev. 1991; 29: 319-407Google Scholar), possesses three hemoglobins, two of them dissolved in the vascular blood (V1 and V2), and one in the coelomic fluid (C1). Their molecular weights have been determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy mass mapping (STEM) and by multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS). Both methods yielded approximately the same molecular weights with mass significantly higher than the literature data for V1. V1, V2, and C1 had M of 3396 ± 540 × 103, 393 ± 71 × 103, and 410 ± 51 × 103 by STEM, and 3503 ± 13 × 103, 433 ± 8 × 103, and 380 ± 4 × 103 by MALLS, respectively. However, STEM mass mapping measurements for V1 Hb were actually made on one-twelfth molecules (8.Zal F. Lallier F.H. Wall J.S. Vinogradov S.N. Toulmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8869-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the M noted above is therefore an approximation, probably less accurate than MALLS result. Transmission electron micrographs of V1 are typical of an hexagonal bilayer hemoglobin (HBL Hb).Reduced annelid Hbs exhibit a variety of SDS-PAGE profiles, ranging from one subunit of M 13,000-15,000 to seven subunits in the range of M 13,000 to 40,000 (12.Vinogradov S.N.

More recently, a more accurate technique, ESI-MS, has been successfully applied to some HBL Hbs allowing the determination of the complete polypeptide chain compositions of these Hbs(13.Martin P.D.

They consist of 4 to 6 globin chains in the range 16,000-18,000 Da and 3-4 linker chains in the range 24,000-27,000 Da. Previous studies by SDS-PAGE on Riftia vascular Hbs have shown that they consist of subunits of M15,000, 30,000, and 45,000 (16.Arp A.J. Childress J.J. Vetter R.D. J. Exp.

In this report we have determined the stoichiometry of the polypeptide chains and subunits constituting these Hbs by ESI-MS coupled with maximum entropy(19.Ashton D.S. Beddell C.R. Green B.N.

In addition, these results are compared with those obtained by SDS-PAGE.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal CollectionLive R. pachyptila were collected at about 2600 m depth during four oceanographic cruises (10 1991, 4 1992, 11 1994, and 4 1995) with the “Nautile” and “Alvin” submersibles on the East Pacific Rise at 13°N (12°46′-12°50′N and 103°57′-103°56′W) and 9°N (9°48′-9°50′N and 104°17′W). Specimens which had not been damaged during collection were dissected 2 to 8 h after capture and the fluids contained in their circulatory and coelomic compartments were separately and carefully collected and stored as described previously (20.Toulmond A.

The column was equilibrated with a Riftia saline buffer as described in Zal et al.(8.Zal F. Lallier F.H. Wall J.S. Vinogradov S.N. Toulmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8869-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and concentrated with microconcentrator Centricon-10 (Amicon). One or two further purifications using the same protocol were performed to obtain clear fractions when necessary.SDS-PAGESDS-PAGE was carried out on the different Hbs using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli on slab gels(21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). The gel dimensions were 1.5 mm × 16 cm × 18 cm (LKB instrument). The stacking gel was constituted of 4 and 2.7% of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide, pH 6.8, and the resolving gel by 10 and 2.7%, pH 8.8. Samples of Hbs (1 mg/ml) were incubated at 100°C for 90 s in the presence or absence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Sample migration was performed at constant intensity of 150 mA using a Tris-glycine buffer, pH = 8.3, for about 2 h. Identification of subunit relations after 2-mercaptoethanol treatment was done by two-dimensional electrophoresis process. A gel slice corresponding to the observed bands after SDS migration was cut and incubated under reducing conditions. It was then placed on top of a new gel and electrophoresed as described above. The gels were stained overnight on agitator in 0.125% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, water. The molecular mass of each constituent polypeptide chain was determined from a plot of the log molecular mass versus the mobility of low molecular weight protein standards of Pharmacia(22.Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were scanned at 550 nm on a Vernon densitometer and the peaks area were determined by a Coradi planimeter.Electrospray Ionization Mass SpectrometryESI-MS analysis were carried out at VG Organic, Altrincham, UK. Purified Hb samples were extensively dialyzed against distilled water and lyophilized. 1 mg of each of these samples was dissolved in distilled water (concentration 10 μg/μl). Then 10-μl aliquots of these solutions were diluted with 20 μl of 1% formic acid, 20 μl of distilled water, and 50 μl of acetonitrile to make the working solutions for the analyses before DTT treatment (final concentration, 1 μg/μl, 50/50 HO/CHCN plus 0.2% HCOOH). DTT was then added (concentration 2 mM) and incubated at 40°C. After 15, 30, and 60 min, 10 μl were removed from the HO solution and diluted as described above to make the working solutions. ESI-MS analysis was made from these solutions without further purification. The apoHb was formed using extraction of heme with acid-acetone at pH 4 and −20°C(23.Rossi-Fannelli A. Antonini E. Caputo A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 30: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The white precipitate of apoHb was exhaustively dialyzed against water and carbamidomethylated with iodoacetamide using the same conditions as for carboxymethylation (3.Suzuki T. Gotoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9257-9267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deglycosylation was carried out using recombinant N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) in 0.25 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, overnight at 37°C(24.Tarentino A.L. Gomez C.M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4665-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). ESI-MS analysis was performed on a VG Quattro II (VG Organic, Altrincham, Cheshire, UK) scanning over the m/z range 600-2500 in 10 s/scan and 45 scans summed over approximately 8 min from three 10-μl aliquots of the working solutions to produce the final data. The flow rate into the electrospray source was 5 μl/min. The sampling cone/skimmer potential was ramped from 35 V at m/z 600 to 55 V at m/z 2400 during each scan. Mass scale calibration employed the multiply charged series from horse heart myoglobin (M = 16951.5; Sigma catalog no. M-1882). Molecular masses are based on the following atomic weights of the elements: C = 12.011, H = 1.00794, n = 14.00674, O = 15.9994 and S = 32.066(25.IUPAC Commission on atomic weights and isotopic abundancesJ. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1993; 22: 1571-1584Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The raw ESI-MS spectra were processed using a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) based approach (26.Ferrige A.G. Seddon M.J.

Takagi T. Furukohri T. Ohta S. Zool. Sci. 1989; 6: 915-926Google Scholar). Fig. 1 presents the SDS-PAGE profiles of R. pachyptila Hbs V1 (lanes 1 and 2), V2 (lanes 3 and 4) and C1 (lanes 5 and 6) in the presence or absence of reducing agent. The unreduced Hb V1 dissociated in SDS into six subunits (lane 1): subunits A1 and A2 with apparent molecular weights of 16,000 and 17,000, subunit A3 with M 29,000, subunits A4 and A5 both with M close to 32,000 and subunit A6 with M 36,000. After reduction (lane 2), Hb V1 dissociated into eight polypeptide chains consisting of two groups: one in the range M 16,000-19,000 (AI-AIV) and the other in the range M 29,000-40,000 (AV-AVIII). Subunits A1 and A2 correspond to the monomeric globin chains AIII and AIV, subunit A3 would be a disulfide-bonded dimer of globin chains AI and AII, and subunits A4 to A6 correspond to four non-heme-containing chains AV-AVIII.V2 and C1 have similar dissociation patterns with three subunits of M 16000, 19,000 and 29,000: B1, B2, and B3 (lane 3), and C1, C2, and C3 (lane 5), respectively. Upon reduction V2 and C1 dissociate into four polypeptide chains with M ranging from 16,000 to 19,000: BI to BIV (lane 4) and CI to CIV (lane 6), respectively. Subunits B3 and C3, like subunit A3 in V1 Hb, correspond to disulfide-bonded dimers of globin chains BI and BII, and CI and CII, respectively.Polypeptide Chains Composition Determined by ESI-MSThe nomenclature used to name the different subunits and polypeptide chains follows the one used for Lumbricus terrestris HBL Hb(28.Fushitani K. Riggs A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9461-9463Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the raw, multicharged ESI mass spectrum of HBL Hb V1. Fig. 2, B-D, shows deconvoluted spectra obtained by MaxEnt analysis for Hbs V1, V2, and C1. The deconvoluted mass spectrum of V1 Hb (Fig. 2B) revealed three groups of components. The first one around M 16,000-17,000, comprised two polypeptide chains with b, M 16,133.5 ± 0.7, and c, M 16,805.9 ± 0.8. The middle group, around M 23,000-27,000, comprised two major components with L1, M 23505.2 ± 3.0, L2, M 23851.4 ± 3.0, and two minor components L3, M 26342.4 ± 3.0 and L4, M 27,425.8 ± 3.0. These subunits (L1-L4) occur with the following relative intensities of 1.0:1.0:0.5:0.5. Finally, a last group with M over 30,000 contained only one component, D1, M 31720.8 ± 0.2. Upon DTT treatment, D1 decreased in relative intensity and two new components appeared with d, M 15,578.5 ± 0.0, and e, M 16,149.1 ± 0.8, clearly indicating that D1 was a covalent dimer (data not shown).Figure 2ESI-MS spectra of R. pachyptila native Hbs.

The first group (close-up in Fig. 3A), in addition to chain b and c, contained five glycosylated isoforms of chain a (a1, M 17,636.4 ± 1.0, a2, M 17,799.0 ± 1.0; a3, M = 17,962.3 ± 0.1; a4, M 18,451.0 ± 1.1; a5, M 18,613.2 ± 0.5) which could be identified by comparison with the mass spectrum of the deglycosylated V2 Hb (Fig. 3B). It should be noted that deglycosylation of V1 Hb did not bring any change in the spectrum. The second group contained D1 and another dimer D2 = 32,511.7 ± 1.3 (Fig. 2C), which after reduction appeared to be constituted of chains e and f, M 16,368.1 ± 0.3 (Fig. 3C). The mass spectrum of C1 Hb (Fig. 2D) resembles that of V2, except that it does not contain dimer D1. Table 1 lists the average masses of the various components of V1, V2 and C1 Hbs. These results clearly revealed that (i) HBL Hb V1 was devoid of glycoprotein and possessed linker chains (L1-L4), (ii) V2 and C1 Hbs possessed glycosylated chains but no linker chain, and (iii) V2 and C1 were different Hbs, the former containing a dimer absent from the latter.Figure 3MaxEnt processed ESI-MS of various derivatives of R. pachyptila Hb V2 presented on an expanded mass scale.

V3 consisted of the dimer D1, while V4 was composed of the monomers b, c and the glycosylated isoforms of chain a. The mass spectrum of C2 was identical to that of C1.Carbohydrate and Cysteine Residue Contents- Fig. 3 presents the mass spectra of Hb V2 after various treatments. Deglycosylation allowed us to determine the mass of chain a (M 15,933.4 ± 0.3; Fig. 3B) and we found that the glycosylated isoforms a1-a5 differ in mass by one or more hexose residue(s) (162.1 Da). The difference in mass between chain a5 and chain a (2680.3 Da) is, within experimental error, the mass of the glycan residue (HexNAc)(Hex) (2676.40 Da). Note that ESI-MS cannot distinguish between monosaccharide residues because they have identical masses.Comparing mass spectra obtained after carbamidomethylation with or without reduction, we have determined the numbers of free Cys residues and disulfide bonds. Fig. 3D shows the results obtained after reduction and carbamidomethylation of V2 Hb. Monomeric chains b and c, and the different glycosylated isoforms of chain a possess one intrachain disulfide bond. Chain b contains also one free Cys residue. Dimers D1 and D2 contain only one interchain disulfide bond which is quite resistant to reduction since ≥50% of the dimers are still present after 60 min with 5 mM DTT (data not shown). Each chain composing D1 and D2 (d, e, and f) contains one intrachain disulfide bond but only chain e has an additional free Cys. We have also found twelve Cys residues on the linker chain L1. Table 2 summarizes glycan composition and number of Cys residues for all chains.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Quaternary Structure Models of R. pachyptila HbsDensitometry analysis of SDS-PAGE profiles for V1 Hb chains AI, AII, AIII, and AIV yielded unclear results and did not allow us to propose a coherent quaternary model for Hb V1 using this technique. However, for V2 Hb, the polypeptide chains BI, BII, BIII, and BIV occur in the ratio 1:1:1:0.5 (average of five gel densitometry analysis) consistent with the following assemblage: ((BI, BII, BIII)BIV)). In this model containing 28 polypeptide chains, a trimer is composed of a disulfide-bonded dimer of chains BI and BII and a monomeric chain BIII, and two trimers are linked by one chain BIV. A similar model could be applied to C1 Hb.MaxEnt analysis of ESI-MS spectra produces quantitative relative intensity data. It provides a zero charge spectrum in which the areas under the peaks are proportional to the sum of the intensities of the peaks in the original raw multicharged spectrum. Using mass measurements of the different Hbs obtained by MALLS (8.Zal F. Lallier F.H. Wall J.S. Vinogradov S.N. Toulmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8869-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the exact masses of polypeptide chains determined by ESI-MS, we propose coherent models of the quaternary structure of Riftia Hbs. According to these results HBL Hb V1 would consist of 144 globin-like chains (48 monomers and 48 dimers) and 36 linker chains (Table 3). In this model, the relative intensities of the four linker chains were L1:L2:L3:L4 = 1:1:0.5:0.5, the globin:linker ratio was 0.75:0.25 and the mass of protein per heme yielded 22,805 g. The primary functional subunit of HBL Hb V1 corresponds to a dodecamer ((cD1)(bD1)) with a calculated molecular mass of 200 kDa. This basic subunit should be bound to three linker chains (e.g. 1 L1, 1 L2, and either 1 L3 or L4) corresponding to a total linker mass of 74 kDa. Finally we obtain for the whole molecule a molecular mass of 3285 kDa.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In the same way, Hb V2 (Table 4) and C1 (Table 5) would be constituted of 24 globin-like chains providing a calculated mass of 403 and 406 kDa including heme and glycan side chains, respectively. We propose the following molecular models, ((cD)(bD)(aD)) for Hb V2 (D being D1 or D2) and ((cD2)(bD2)(aD2)) for Hb C1. The dissociation product V3 is composed of ((D1)) (99 kDa, calculated mass, Table 6). The dissociation product C2 is composed of ((cD2)(bD2)(aD2)) (206 kDa, calculated mass, Table 7).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONSDS-PAGE has been widely used in the past to study the structure of proteins, including HBL Hbs of annelids (12.Vinogradov S.N.

Even though ESI-MS gives more accurate results (see below) very few HBL Hbs have been studied with this technique to date (13.Martin P.D. Kuchumov A.R. Green B.N. Oliver R.W.A. Braswell E.H.

Hbs (6.Suzuki T. Takagi T. Furukohri T. Ohta S. Zool. Sci. 1989; 6: 915-926Google Scholar) and clearly reveal that only HBL Hb V1 possesses linker chains with molecular mass of 32 and 36 kDa (AV-AVIII). Moreover, upon reduction these polypeptide chains display bands with a reduced mobility, indicative of even higher molecular masses. This phenomenon has been previously observed in other HBL Hbs (6.Suzuki T. Takagi T. Furukohri T. Ohta S. Zool. Sci. 1989; 6: 915-926Google Scholar, 12.Vinogradov S.N. Shlom J.M. Kapp. O.H.

It is known that unreduced proteins containing intrachain disulfide bonds possess a more compact hydrodynamic shape in SDS than the fully reduced proteins (30.Reynolds J.A. Tanford C. J. Biol.

In addition, SDS-PAGE overestimates the true molecular mass of components containing glycan or a high content of some amino acids such as proline(35.Lamblin P. Rochu D. Fine J.M. Anal.

Moreover, the high resolution (1500) allows polypeptide chains with close molecular masses to be distinguished. Vascular Hb V1 consists of two monomeric globin chains b and c, one disulfide-bonded dimer (D1) of globin chains d and e, and four different linker chains L1-L4. Vascular Hb V2 consists of three monomeric globin chains, a, b, and c, chain a occurring as five glycosylated forms (a1-a5), and two disulfide-bonded dimers, D1 and D2, the latter consisting of chains e and f. These results imply that V2 is not a subunit of V1. Coelomic Hb C1 shares with the vascular Hb V2, the three monomeric globin chains a, b, and c, including the glycosylated isoforms a1-a5, the disulfide-bonded dimer D2 and the absence of linker subunits. However, it lacks the dimer D1 and therefore, in"

To determine if β-thymosin behaves like a simple G-actin buffering agent in the complex environment of a cell, we overexpressed thymosin β10 (Tβ10) in NIH3T3 cells and determined the effect on the monomer/polymer equilibrium. Tβ10 is the predominant β-thymosin isoform in the NIH3T3 cell line, and it is present in approximately equal molar ratio to profilin and cofilin/actin depolymerizing factor, two other well characterized actin monomer binding proteins. Clonal cell lines that overexpressed three times more Tβ10 had 23-33% more polymerized actin than control cells, and the filaments appeared thicker after staining with fluorescent phalloidin. There was no change in total actin, profilin, and cofilin/actin depolymerizing factor content. The overexpressing cells were more motile; they spread faster and had higher chemotactic and wound healing activity. Assuming that there is no compensatory inactivation of the other classes of monomer binding proteins, our paradoxical observation can be accounted for quantitatively by a parallel in vitro study (Carlier, M.-F., Didry, D., Erk, I., Lepault, J., Van Troys, L., Vanderkekove, J., Perelroizen, I., Yin, H. L., Doi, Y., and Pantaloni, D.,(1996) J. Biol.

This reduces the monomer buffering ability of β-thymosin, so that above a certain threshold an incremental increase in thymosin does not lead to a corresponding increase in G-actin. Furthermore, the decrease in Cc reduces the buffering capacity of the other actin monomer binding proteins. As a consequence, an increase in β-thymosin does not necessarily result in a proportionate increase in actin monomer content in a complex environment containing other actin monomer binding proteins. The outcome depends on the level of β-thymosin expression relative to the composition of the other actin monomer binding protien. Our results suggest that β-Thymosins are not simple actin buffering proteins and that their biphasic action may have physiological significance. β-Thymosins are the currently favored candidates for maintaining the large actin monomer (G-actin) pool in living cells.

IGF2 is transcribed from four promoters (P1-P4), and in most tissues, the gene is imprinted. In this study, we have analyzed IGF2 promoter usage and determined the allelic expression from each promoter in 19 ApaI- and 22 AluI-heterozygous Wilms' tumors. Loss of IGF2 imprinting (LOI) was observed in 8 ApaI-informative tumors. In these tumors, each parental allele was expressed in equal abundance, indicating that there was complete relaxation of IGF2 imprinting. In each LOI tumor, expression from promoter P1 as well as from the normally imprinted promoters P2-P4 was biallelic. In the 11 ApaI-informative tumors which maintained IGF2 imprinting (maintenance of imprinting), transcription from promoters P2-P4 was always monoallelic, while transcripts from P1 were derived from either one or both alleles. The lack of consistency of IGF2 imprinting of promoter P1 in maintenance of imprinting tumors was also observed in normal fetal tissues of 6-12 weeks gestation, suggesting a similarity in IGF2 regulation between Wilms' tumors and embryonic tissue development.

Steenbergh P.H. Holthuizen P. Growth Reg. 1992; 2: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). The gene is flanked by the insulin gene upstream and immediately downstream by H19, a developmentally-regulated gene which codes for an RNA that lacks appropriate protein reading frames. H19 is highly expressed in fetal tissues but is often not transcribed in adult tissues(2.Brannan C.I. Dees E.C. Ingram R.S. Tilghman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). IGF2 has nine exons, four promoters, and two functional polyadenylation addition signals, leading to a variety of mRNA species(3.Van Dijk M.A. Van Schaik F.M.A. Bootsma H.J. Holthuizen P. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 81: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Promoter usage has been shown to be tissue-specific and developmentally regulated. For example, in fetal liver, IGF-II mRNA is transcribed predominately from promoters 2, 3, and 4. After birth, hepatic IGF-II synthesis continues, but the activity of promoters 2-4 declines, and promoter 1 becomes the predominant hepatic promoter(4.De Pagter-Holthuizen P. Jansen M.

In other tissues, however, promoters 3 and 4 predominate during adult life. Despite the use of multiple promoters and the production of a large number of IGF-II mRNA species, a single prepro-IGF-II peptide is synthesized in most cells. In addition to the most abundant 7.5-kDa 67 amino acid mature IGF-II, 15- and 10-kDa variant human IGF-II peptides have also been found(5.Zumstein P.P. Luthi C. Humbel R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In most normal human tissues except for liver and central nervous system, IGF-II mRNA is only transcribed from the paternally-derived allele(7.Giannoukakis N. Deal C. Paquette J. Goodyer C.G. Polychronakos C. Nature Genet. 1993; 4: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We have shown that IGF2 imprinting is promoter-dependent; in normal human liver and chondrocytes, when promoter P1 is used, IGF2 is expressed biallelically, but when P2, P3, or P4 are employed, only monoallelic expression is seen(8.Vu T. Hoffman A.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). While IGF-II is a mitogenic peptide that is required for normal fetal growth(9.DeChiara T.M. Efstratiadis A. Robertson E.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), its role in adult physiology is unknown. A variety of human malignancies contain increased concentrations of IGF-II mRNA compared to normal tissues, and the subsequent excessive production of the pro-IGF-II peptide has been implicated as the cause of non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia(10.Phillips L.S. Robertson D.G. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1993; 42: 1093-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that IGF2 overexpression is either an initiator of oncogenesis (11.Feinberg A.P. Nature Genet. 1993; 4: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or perhaps a marker for malignant transformation. Wilms' tumor is the most common intra-abdominal tumor in childhood. The malignancy is derived from persistent primitive blastemic cells in nephrogenic rests(12.Coppes M.J. Haber D.A. Grundy P.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). IGF2 is overexpressed in many Wilms' tumors. Moreover, IGF2 imprinting is relaxed and the IGF2 gene product is transcribed from both paternal and maternal alleles in approximately 70% of Wilms' tumors, suggesting that loss of IGF2 imprinting may play an important role in the development or maintenance of this tumor(13.Ogawa O.

Grundy P.E. Feinberg A.P. Nature. 1993; 362: 747-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this alteration of imprinting in these tumors, we have examined the promoter-specific allelic expression of IGF2 in Wilms' tumors which exhibit maintenance as well as loss of IGF2 imprinting. Our results indicate that while there was an increased usage of promoter P1 in some Wilms' tumors, the biallelic expression of IGF2 in tumors with loss of imprinting (LOI) was caused primarily by the biallelic activation of promoters P2-P4. These results are in contrast to the apparent LOI in normal adult liver in which P1 promoter usage and not P3-P4 biallelic expression was observed. In those tumors which demonstrate MOI, promoters P2-P4 were imprinted while transcripts from P1 were derived from either one or both alleles. This variation in promoter P1 imprinting in these tumors was also observed in some early embryonic and fetal tissues. Fresh frozen Wilms' tumor and normal kidney tissues were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH). Normal fetal tissues (6-12 weeks of gestation) were obtained from the Central Laboratory for Human Embryology Tissue, University of Washington, Seattle. Total RNA was extracted by homogenizing the fresh frozen tissues in an acid-guanidium thiocyanate buffer according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi(15.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

The RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of RNase inhibitor (Life Technologies, Inc.). During the course of this study we also have developed a simple procedure to prepare a total nucleic acid fraction (termed TNA). Our TNA preparations, which contain both RNA and DNA, served as starting materials for RNA and DNA preparations using the RNA and DNA-STAT kits. The TNAs were used directly for genotyping by PCR. We compared genotyping results from both DNAs and TNAs. The TNA preparations yielded more reliable PCR data. The presence of RNA in the TNA preparations, unexpectedly, did not interfere or compromise the quality of the genotyping analyses, provided that DNA polymerases without reverse transcriptase activity (e.g. Taq or Tfl DNA polymerases) were used in the PCR reactions. It is more convenient to screen a large number of samples for informative heterozygosity using the TNA preparations, since we then need to prepare RNAs only from the informative samples. Our TNAs also provide high quality, undegraded RNAs which can be analyzed directly by eliminating DNAs with RNase-free DNase I in the presence of RNase inhibitor. Reverse transcription of the TNAs provide both cDNA of the RNA and the genomic DNA which can be used as an internal control in PCR analyses. 2T. H. Vu and A. R. Hoffman, unpublished data. TNA from fresh frozen tissues by homogenizing tissues in 10-20 volumes of an RNA extraction solution containing 4 M guanidium thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% Sarcosyl(15.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63171) Google Scholar). The homogenate was extracted with an equal volume of phenol-chloroform and then precipitated with an equal volume of 2-propanol. A second precipitation with 0.5 volumes of 7.5 M ammonium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol was followed by two rinses with 75% ethanol, yielding a clean DNA+RNA pellet. This simple TNA preparation provides both genomic DNA and undegraded RNA which can then be used directly for DNA-PCR screening, for RT-PCR or for further purification of mRNA by oligo(dT)-cellulose (Life Technologies, Inc.). We analyzed the IGF2 (ApaI, AvaII, and AluI), H19 (AluI), and WT1 (HinfI) polymorphisms by PCR using a DNA or TNA stock solutions of 10 μg/ml. The reactions were carried out using a 96-well PCR plate (MJ Research, Inc., Boston, MA) under liquid wax barrier of “chill-out 14” (MJ Research) with a hot start protocol, by adding a PCR master mixture containing Taq (Hoffman-La Roche) or Tfl DNA polymerases (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI) to the reaction at 60-65° C. Since only a fraction of a microliter (0.1-1 μl) of the PCR products was needed for polyacrylamide-urea gel analysis, we routinely performed a standard 2.5-μl PCR reaction, although larger reaction volumes (e.g. 5 μl) were also easy to perform. In a typical reaction, 10 μl of the liquid wax were delivered to each well of a 96-well plate. Accurate 0.5-μl aliquots of an oligo primer set containing both sense and antisense primers (1 μM each) were delivered to the bottom of each well under the liquid wax using a battery-operated micro P-10 pipette (Rainin, Emeryville, CA). DNA template (1.0 μl) was added to the liquid wax layer by a P-2 Pipettman (Rainin, CA) or the P-10 pipette. The 96-well plate was set on a thermal cycler (MJ Research), covered with Saran Wrap, and heated at 96° C for 2 min. After cooling down and pausing at 60° C (annealing temperature), 1.0 μl of a PCR master mixture containing 2.5 × (PCR buffer + 1.5 mM MgCl), 50 mM dNTP, 0.25 μCi of [α-P]dCTP (Amersham, Il), and 0.125 units of DNA polymerase was delivered to each well. The DNA was amplified for 30 cycles at 95° C for 30 s and 60° C for 1 min, followed by a 5-min extension at 72° C. The PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes by simply adding 5 μl of 1 × buffer containing 1 unit of the enzyme, incubating at 37° C for 1 h (ApaI) or 6 h (AluI). Ten μl of formamide sequencing buffer were added to the PCR products, and aliquots of 4 μl were analyzed on a 5 or 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel. After electrophoresis, the polyacrylamide gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen and analyzed by PhosphorImager Scanner (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The gels were also exposed to x-ray films (Amersham) with an intensifying screen for 12-24 h. We made cDNA stocks by using total RNA, random hexamers, or specific primers, and murine leukemia reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA (2.0 μl of 100-200 μg/ml stock solution) protected with the liquid wax (10 μl) was heat denatured at 75° C for 1 min, and then cooled on ice. At room temperature, a cDNA master mixture (3.0 μl) containing first strand buffer, dithiothreitol, all 4 dNTPs, RNase inhibitor, random hexamer (or specific oligo primer), and the reverse transcriptase was added to the RNA at the concentrations recommended by the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction tubes were incubated at 20° C for 5 min, then 37° C for 25 min, followed by 5 cycles (50° C for 20 s and 37° C for 5 min), and then 99° C for 5 min as described previously(8.Vu T. Hoffman A.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). After enzyme deactivation, the cDNA samples were diluted 10-fold by adding 45 μl of sterile water. One microliter of the diluted cDNA was analyzed by our standard 2.5-μl PCR reaction in standard 0.2-ml thin-wall tubes, using 0.50 μl of P end-labeled primer (labeled by [-P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase) and 1.0 μl of the PCR master mixture without [α-P]dCTP. The PCR amplification and restriction digestion were essentially under the same conditions as described in the PCR genotyping section. Nested PCR was performed as described previously (8.Vu T. Hoffman A.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) using primers which were specific for human IGF2. To ensure complete digestion of ApaI and AvaII, an internal DNA control template (300 base pairs) was added to the digestion reaction(8.Vu T. Hoffman A.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The AluI digestion was monitored by an internal non-polymorphic AluI site which resulted in a 112-base pair band in Fig. 4. The polyacrylamide gels were analyzed by PhosphorImager Scanner and quantitation was based on the scanning density. To assay for IGF2 promoter usage in Wilms' tumors and normal tissues, we have developed a multiplex PCR. The cDNAs, which were made by random hexamer priming, were amplified with 4 promoter-specific 5′-sense primers (primers p1a, p2a, p3c, and p4c, see below), and a common 3′-antisense primer (p10 or p11). The 3′-common primer was end-labeled with [-P]ATP. The promoter-specific primers were designed to have a similar T so that they have similar amplification kinetics by combination with the 3′-common primer. The relative PhosphorImager scanning density therefore represents the relative abundance of the promoter-specific transcripts. In a control experiment, single primer sets comprising a single 5′-primer and a common p11 primer were used to amplify each promoter-specific transcript, and to compare with the amplification efficiency in the multiplex PCR. We also performed a standard dilution experiment, in which each of four P1-P4 templates were diluted in a series of 1/1, 1/3, and 1/10 before mixing in a multiplex PCR. PCR amplification (5 μl of reaction) was performed for 28 cycles (95° C for 30 s, 60° C for 1 min, 72° C for 1 min) under similar conditions as described in RT-PCR. The primers specific for promoter P1 to P4 are: p1a, 5′-CAG TGA CTC CCC GGT CCT CTT TAT C-3′; p1b, 5′-CAG TCC TGA GGT GAG CTG CTG TGG C-3′; p1c, 5′-CCC AAC TGC GAG GCA GAG AGA CAC-3′; p1d, 5′-GGG CCG AAG AGT CAC CAC CGA GC −3′; p1e, 5′-GCT GGC AGC GAT TCA GAG CCC TG-3′; p2a, 5′-ACC GGG CAT TGC CCC CAG T(TC)T CC-3′; p2b, 5′-ACG CAG CCT CCA GCT TCG CGA CAC-3′; p3a, 5′-CGT CGC ACA TTC GGC C(TC)C (CT)GC GAC T-3′; p3b, 5′-GCA GCG TCG CCG GCT TCC AG(AG) (CT)AC-3′; p4a, 5′-TCC TCC TC(TC) TCC (AT)GC CCC AGC G-3′; p4b, 5′-AGC CTT CTG CTG AGC TGT AGA CAC-3′. The primers in exon 9 are as follows: p5a, 5′-CTT GGA CTT T(GT)A GTC AAA TTG GC-3′; p5b, 5′-CCC TGA ACC AGC AAA GAG AAA AGA AGG-3′; p6, 5′- GAG CTG TGT TCA TGT ATG TGC TGC GCA-3′; p7, 5′- GGG GTG AGG GT(CT) GTG CCA ATT A-3′; p8, 5′- GTG ATG GAA AAG GGA GTG AGG AGCC-3′; p9, 5′-GAG GAG CCA GTC TGG GTT GTT GCT A-3′. The antisense 3′-primers in exon 7 for multiplex PCR are: p10, 5′-CAG CAA TGC AGC AC(GA) AGG CGA AGG C-3′ and p11, 5′-GAA GCT TAG AAG CAC CAG CAT CGA CTT C-3′. Mixed bases noted in parentheses designates primers that were designed for use for both human and murine IGF2 genes. The underlined bases indicate a restriction site. We screened 70 Wilms' tumors and 6 normal adjacent kidney tissues for the presence of the ApaI polymorphism (16.Tadokoro K. Fujii H. Inoue T. Yamada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) in IGF2 exon 9 (Fig. 1A), the AluI polymorphism (17.Lucassen A.M. Julier C. Beressi J.P. Boitard C. Froguel P. Lathrop M. Bell J.I. Nature Genet. 1993; 4: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) in IGF2 exon 3, the H19 AluI polymorphism(18.Zhang Y. Tycko B. Nature Genet. 1992; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), and the WT1 HinfI polymorphism(19.Hoban P.R. Kelsey A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 19: 1164Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The human IGF2, H19, and WT1 genes are located on chromosome 11p and loss of heterozygosity at this locus appears frequently in Wilms' tumor. Three of the six pairs of Wilms' tumors and the adjacent normal kidney showed loss of heterozygosity for WT1, H19, or both IGF2 and H19 (data not shown). Twenty tumors were heterozygous for the ApaI polymorphism and 19 were examined for IGF2 allelic expression (Table 1). Eight of the ApaI heterozygous tumors showed biallelic expression of IGF2 (LOI) while 11 of these tumors showed MOI. Fig. 1B shows representative data from subjects 5 and 6 (LOI) and 9 and 11 (MOI). Sixteen of the 19 tumors were also IGF2 AluI heterozygotes, a polymorphism which facilitates the analysis of allelic transcripts from IGF2 promoter P1. Six other Wilms' tumors were IGF2 AluI heterozygotes but ApaI homozygotes (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Since genomic imprinting has been defined as a parent of origin effect on the differential expression of the two parental alleles, it is appropriate to analyze the imprinting quantitatively. To determine the relative contribution of the two parental alleles in genomic DNA and in cDNAs by PCR, we used primers flanking the polymorphic ApaI site in IGF2 exon 9 (Fig. 1A). The IGF2 ApaI heterozygosity has a unique feature: the alleles differ by a single base (GGGCCC and GGACCC) can be digested by two different restriction enzymes, ApaI and AvaII. This specific feature allowed a more accurate quantitation of the two alleles. Aliquots of the PCR products which were labeled at one end by a P end-labeled primer were digested with ApaI and AvaII enzymes. The extent of the enzyme digestion was monitored by an internal control template in each digestion tube. Since the a allele, which is not digested by ApaI is cut by AvaII (and the b allele is digested by ApaI and not by AvaII), the average values from the two separate enzymatic digestions of the same PCR products eliminates any artifactual interference of undigested heteroduplexes which have been noted in previous studies(13.Ogawa O. Eccles M.R. Szeto J. McNoe L.A. Yun K. Maw M.A. Smith P.J. Reeve A.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 749-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In all 8 LOI tumors, the two parental alleles of IGF2 demonstrated quantitatively equal expression, indicating a complete disruption of imprinting in these tumors. The ratios of the two allelic mRNA transcripts were close to 50% and were similar to the ratios of the two alleles from the genomic DNA (Table 1). In all 11 MOI tumors, on the other hand, IGF2 was transcribed from only one parental allele (Table 1). Leaky expression of the suppressed allele (average 2.2%, Table 1) may be attributable in part to the biallelic expression of IGF2 that occurred from promoter P1. Since IGF2 imprinting has been shown to be promoter specific in a variety of tissues, we were interested to learn if the reversal of the imprinting process involved all four promoters. We hypothesized that LOI was a result of either: 1) promoter switching, whereby transcription from the imprinted promoters P2-P4 declined and transcription from the non-imprinted promoter P1 greatly increased; or, 2) biallelic expression from all four promoters. Therefore, we determined IGF2 promoter usage in 8 informative tumors. In order to estimate the relative abundance of IGF2 transcripts derived from each promoter, we developed a multiplex PCR assay. A panel of oligonucleotide primers was synthesized, all of which have a similar T and which were specific for each of the promoters. These were used in conjunction with a downstream primer, p11, in exon 7 (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained using downstream primer p10 (not shown). The transcripts corresponding to promoters P1-P4 were amplified separately and together in a multiplex PCR with similar efficiency (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-5). The quantitative nature of this assay was demonstrated by performing standard dilutions of each of the specific templates in a multiplex mixture (Fig. 2B, P1-P4). In each case, proportionally decreasing amounts of the specific PCR product was observed. For the purpose of quantitation of promoter usage, a slight difference in PCR amplification efficiency was adjusted by conversion factors which varied from 0.66 to 2.68 (Table 2). Similar results were also obtained without this adjustment.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab We determined the IGF2 promoter usage in each tissue by PhosphorImager scanning of the specific PCR products (Table 2). As expected, in human adult liver, IGF2 was transcribed predominantly from promoter P1 (90.3%), whereas P3 and P4 accounted for 9.7% of the total transcripts. In contrast, in newborn liver and in some fetal tissues (54 days of gestation), P3 and P4 accounted for more than 90% of the total IGF2 transcripts, with P1 accounting for ≤1%. In the Wilms' tumors (Fig. 2C), just as in normal tissues, IGF2 was transcribed predominantly from promoter P3 (80%). Interestingly, in comparison to fetal kidney, most of the Wilms' tumors showed a dramatic increase in the use of promoters P1 and P2 (Table 2). However, except for tumor 2, in most cases, promoters P1 and P2 each accounted for <15% of the total transcripts. There was no difference in promoter usage in those tumors which demonstrated LOI for IGF2 (tumors 1-6) compared with those in which IGF2 remained imprinted (tumors 9-11). Thus, despite varying promoter usage, relaxation of IGF2 imprinting in Wilms' tumor was not simply accomplished by promoter switching from the monoallelically expressed promoters P2, P3, and P4 to the biallelically expressed promoter P1. To examine the allelic expression of IGF2 from individual promoters P1-P4 in Wilms' tumors, we amplified full-length PCR transcripts from each promoter using a nested PCR as described previously(8.Vu T. Hoffman A.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Full-length transcripts from P1 were of low abundance and were observed in tumors from subjects 1 (not shown), 2 and 3 (Fig. 3). The nature of the double nested PCR technique does not allow an accurate quantitation of the expression of the two alleles. In the tumors which demonstrate LOI, IGF2 was biallelically expressed from all four promoters (subjects 2 and 3 in Fig. 3; and 5 and 6, not shown). Since promoter P1 is not normally imprinted in liver and chondrocytes (8.Vu T. Hoffman A.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 714-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), in fetal pancreas, and in some fetal kidneys (see below), LOI in Wilms' tumor therefore represents the relaxation of imprinting from promoters P2-P4 with the maintenance of biallelic expression from P1. In each of the tumors in which IGF2 remained imprinted, IGF2 was transcribed exclusively from one allele from promoters P2, P3, and P4 (Fig. 3, subjects 9 and 10). To further investigate allelic expression from promoter P1, we took advantage of a recently discovered AluI polymorphism in exon 3 of the IGF2 gene(17.Lucassen A.M. Julier C. Beressi J.P. Boitard C. Froguel P. Lathrop M. Bell J.I. Nature Genet. 1993; 4: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The propinquity of this polymorphic site to the region of promoter P1 allows a direct analysis of a relatively short P1 transcript. We screened DNA from the Wilms' tumors for the AluI polymorphism using primers spanning 81 bases of exon 3 (Fig. 4A). Sixteen of the 19 ApaI heterozygous tumors were also AluI heterozygotes (Table 1). The AluI and ApaI polymorphic sites may exist under disequilibrium as in the case of many polymorphic sites in the insulin gene which is located 2 kilobases 5′ of the IGF2 gene(17.Lucassen A.M. Julier C. Beressi J.P. Boitard C. Froguel P. Lathrop M. Bell J.I. Nature Genet. 1993; 4: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 20.Bennett S.T. Lucassen A.M. Gough S.C.L. Powell E.E. Undlien D.E. Pritchard L.E. Merriman M.E. Kawaguchi Y. Dronsfield M.J. Pociot F. Nerup J. Bouzekri N. Cambon-Thomsen A. Ronningen K.S. Barnett A.H. Bain S.C. Todd J.A. Nature Genet. 1995; 9: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Transcripts from P1 were analyzed by RT-PCR using primers spanning exons 2 and 3. An internal AluI site in exon 2 served as an internal restriction control (Fig. 4A). In LOI tumors, transcripts from P1 were derived from both alleles (Table 1, subjects 2-8; Fig. 4B, lanes 3-5). In contrast, in 5 of 9 AluI-informative MOI tumors, more than 95% of P1 transcripts were from one allele only (Table 1 and Fig. 4B, lanes 6-9). Since the genomic imprinting of IGF2 is specific for promoters P2-P4, we speculated that there may exist variations in IGF2 imprinting during early development in some specific tissues. Using the AluI polymorphism, we have observed fluctuation of imprinting of promoter P1 in various normal tissues. As early as 6 to 8 weeks of gestation, biallelic IGF2 expression of P1 was observed in brain and liver (not shown), as well as in kidney and adrenal from different subjects (Fig. 4B, lanes 10 and 11). In a subject at 12 weeks of embryonic development, the fluctuation was tissue specific: both parental alleles showed equal expression from P1 in kidney (lane 12), but unequal expression in other tissues (lanes 13-15). Such fluctuation of imprinting was specific for the promoter P1 region. There was no indication of variation in imprinting in transcripts from promoters P2-P4. Analysis of total IGF2 transcripts which derived predominantly from promoters P3 and P4 in various normal fetal tissues (liver, lung, kidney, pancreas, heart, limb, adrenal, spleen, and gut) showed only monoallelic expression (data not shown). To compare the disruption of imprinting in Wilms' tumor with the imprinting alteration in other malignancies, we also examined the promoter allelic expression of IGF2 in lung tumors, hepatoblastomas, and in several normal tissues. In addition to normal livers and chondrocytes, we have observed IGF2 promoter-specific imprinting in an adrenal gland from a 19-week-old fetus (data not shown) and in a pancreas from an 8-week-old fetus (Fig. 5A). In a hepatoblastoma which demonstrated persistent imprinting, we found monoallelic expression of IGF2 from promoters P2-P4 (98-100%) and biallelic expression from P1. This hepatoblastoma (Fig. 5B) maintained the promoter-specific imprinting which has been reported in liver. In an informative LOI lung tumor, IGF2 transcripts were derived from P1-P4 promoters of both parental alleles (Fig. 5C). The imprinting alteration in this lung cancer, therefore, is similar to the LOI seen in Wilms' tumor. Genomic imprinting refers to a phenomenon whereby only one of the two parental alleles is expressed, while the other allele is transcriptionally silenced. In some circumstances, it appears that the imprinting process is completely efficient, leaving one allele totally"

The remaining residues in PSI-C are likely to be folded in a way similar to the soluble 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins. Two modified PSI-C subunits lacking either the 8-residue loop or 10 residues of the C terminus were expressed in Escherichia coli and used to reconstitute a barley P700-F core prepared to specifically lack PSI-C, PSI-D, and PSI-E. As shown by EPR spectroscopy, the modified proteins carry two [4Fe-4S] clusters with characteristics similar to those of native PSI-C. Western blot analysis of the reconstituted photosystem I complexes showed that the modified PSI-C proteins bind to the P700-F core. Flash photolysis revealed that in photosystem I complexes reconstituted in the presence of PSI-D with the C-terminally deleted PSI-C, the F/F back-reaction was less efficiently restored than with wild-type PSI-C. The loop-deleted PSI-C was even less efficient. We attribute these differences to altered binding properties of the modified proteins. Comparison of reconstitutions performed in the presence and absence of PSI-D shows that the loop-deleted PSI-C is unable to bind without PSI-D, whereas the C-terminally deleted PSI-C binds only weakly with PSI-D.

Matrix fibronectin associates as large complexes in SDS unless a reducing reagent is also present. This observation suggests that complex formation is due to interprotomeric disulfides that form by thiol-disulfide exchange. To localize the presumptive new disulfides, we labeled protomeric fibronectin by the chloramine-T method or with 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent, incorporated 125I-fibronectin into the matrix of cultured fibroblasts, and subjected matrix fibronectin to acid or cyanogen bromide digestion. When cyanogen bromide digests of matrix I-fibronectin and protomeric I-fibronectin labeled with Bolton-Hunter reagent were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in SDS, with the first dimension being nonreducing and the second reducing, we were not able to identify any fragments of matrix fibronectin that migrated as high molecular weight complexes in the first dimension. Limited acid digestion of matrix I-fibronectin also dissociated the majority of the high molecular weight complexes. Since we could account for all of the parts of fibronectin that contain cysteine or cystine, we conclude that matrix fibronectin is not stabilized by interprotomeric disulfides. We propose, instead, that stabilization is mediated by noncovalent protein-protein interactions that are sensitive to reduction, cyanogen bromide digestion, or limited acid digestion.

We propose, instead, that stabilization is mediated by noncovalent protein-protein interactions that are sensitive to reduction, cyanogen bromide digestion, or limited acid digestion. Fibronectin exists in two forms, soluble and insoluble. Soluble protomeric fibronectin is found at substantial concentrations in plasma and other body fluids and in the conditioned media of cultured cells. Insoluble fibronectin is a fibrillar component of the extracellular matrix(1, 2, 3). The insoluble form of fibronectin mediates cell attachment, provides a substrate for cell migration during embryogenesis and wound healing, and thus is considered to be the primary functional form of the protein(2, 4, 5, 6, 7). Absence of fibronectin is lethal to mouse embryos(8). In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that matrix fibronectin consists of both endogenously synthesized cellular fibronectin and circulating plasma fibronectin(3, 9, 10). Unlike many other matrix molecules with conspicuous self-assembly characteristics, purified plasma fibronectin forms insoluble precipitates in vitro only under special conditions of uncertain physiological significance(11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17). In fibroblast cultures, fibronectin fibrils are found on the surface of or between cells(1). Deposited matrix fibronectin is in the form of multimers that resist dissociation with SDS unless sulfhydryl-containing reagents are also present(18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23). This observation suggests that the multimers are stabilized by interprotomeric disulfides. Because blockage of the free sulfhydryls of fibronectin does not impede subsequent formation of SDS-stable multimers, it was further hypothesized that the interprotomeric disulfides form by thiol-disulfide exchange rather than by oxidation of free sulfhydryls(4, 23). Transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking by activated blood coagulation factor XIII also promotes insolubilization(24, 25). Identification of the new disulfides should be as simple as comparing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (1)patterns in SDS of fibronectin fragments analyzed without or with reducing reagent. Fragments of I-labeled protomer and multimer should be the same after reduction, whereas without reduction, two fragments should migrate as a complex in the digest of multimer but not in the digest of protomer. Using such reasoning, our laboratory has argued that multimerization of I-fibronectin involves disulfides in the 70-kDa cathepsin D NH-terminal fragment (23). We found it to be impossible to advance beyond our 1984 study (23) using proteases and began to question the existence of interprotomeric disulfides. In the present paper, we report the negative results of a more rigorous search for interprotomeric disulfides using acid and cyanogen bromide digestion. Because we could identify all of the parts of fibronectin that contain disulfides, these experiments indicate that interprotomeric disulfides do not form during stabilization of fibronectin and are compatible with the formation of strong noncovalent protein-protein interactions that resist disruption with SDS. Fibronectin was iodinated on tyrosines by the chloramine-T method (26) or on lysines using Bolton-Hunter reagent (iodinated 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). For the lysine labeling, 200 μl of 10 mg/ml fibronectin in 0.1 M borate buffer, pH 8.5, was placed in a reaction flask containing the dried I-Bolton-Hunter reagent at 0°C and rocked for 1 h. Glycine in borate buffer was added to the reaction mixture (final concentration, 66 μM) to stop the reaction. Iodinated fibronectin was separated from glycine and unreacted reagent by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column (8-ml bed volume). Bovine serum albumin and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) were added to the labeled protein to final concentrations of 0.2% and 1 mM, respectively. The mixture was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and stored in small aliquots at −70°C until used. The labeled protein contained more than 90% dimers of intact subunits as assessed by SDS-PAGE without or with reduction followed by autoradiography (data not shown) and had a specific activity of 77 μCi/mg fibronectin. Human neonatal foreskin fibroblast TJ6F cells were cultured as described(24). To isolate matrix-bound I-fibronectin, confluent cells in 10-cm tissue culture plates were incubated with 2 × 106 cpm/ml Bolton-Hunter reagent-labeled I-fibronectin and 1 μg/ml unlabeled fibronectin in culture medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin G and 150 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. After 48 h at 37°C, the cells were washed three times with medium and incubated for an additional 4 h at 37°C. The cell layers were washed three times with 10 mM Tris, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4, and treated with 1% deoxycholate (Sigma) in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.3, containing 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mMN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) on ice for 10 min. The deoxycholate-soluble material was poured off the plate, and the deoxycholate-insoluble material left behind in the plate was washed quickly with cold water containing 2 mM EDTA and 2 mM NEM. Unlabeled protomeric fibronectin, 400 μg, was added to the plate, and the mix was scraped in 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM NEM at 80°C. The scraped material was dialyzed against 0.1% SDS containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM NEM, followed by lyophilization. Unlabeled protomeric fibronectin was also mixed with protomeric I-fibronectin, and that mixture was treated with SDS and lyophilized alongside matrix I-fibronectin. The lyophilized pellets were suspended in parallel in 200 μl of 70% formic acid and digested with 120 μl of 5 M cyanogen bromide (27) in acetonitrile (Aldrich) at room temperature in the dark for 24 h in an atmosphere of N. The reactions were quenched by dilution with water, and the reaction mixtures were lyophilized. The pellets were resuspended in nonreducing SDS sample buffer and analyzed by nonreducing/reducing two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. TJ6F cells were incubated with I-fibronectin labeled by the chloramine-T method. Cells were treated with deoxycholate, and deoxycholate-insoluble matrix was isolated with hot SDS as described above. Formic acid was added to a final concentration of 70%, and digestion was carried out at 37°C (28) for the designated time lengths. Digested samples were lyophilized, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. One- and two-dimensional nonreducing/reducing SDS-PAGE analyses were carried out as described previously(23). Lanes containing separated nonreduced samples, including both the stacking and separating gels, were cut out and soaked in 60 mM Tris, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS and 10%β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 60°C. The gel slice was put on top of the stacking gel of the second dimension and sealed with 1% agarose in 60 mM Tris, pH 6.8, containing 1% SDS. After gel electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, destained with 10% acetic acid, and soaked in 40% methanol, 5% glycerol, and 10% acetic acid for 3 h prior to drying in a gel dryer using a gradient heating program. Autoradiography was done by phosphorimaging or by exposing Kodak X-Omat AR film to the dried gels. In some experiments, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose paper and analyzed by immunoblotting using the 9D2, IST-2, and IST-7 monoclonal antibodies(29, 30), or rabbit antibodies to the NH-terminal 70-kDa cathepsin D fragment. Fig. 1 shows the location of Met-Xaa and Asp-Pro peptide bonds in the A and B subunits of human plasma fibronectin that should be sensitive to cyanogen bromide and acid cleavage, respectively (27, 28, 31). Fig. 2 tabulates the predicted sizes of cyanogen bromide and acid digestion fragments under nonreducing and reducing conditions and identifies fragments that contain carbohydrates and therefore that have larger sizes than predicted from the amino acid sequence. Plasma fibronectin is assumed to be composed of one subunit with a V region and one subunit with no V region(2, 31, 32).Figure 2Tabulation of cyanogen bromide (A) and acid (B) fragments of human plasma fibronectin. Met-Xaa (M/X) and Asp-Pro (D/P) peptide bonds are described by residue numbers and module location. Residues are numbered beginning with the NH-terminal pyroglutamate of human fibronectin(31).

https://openalex.org/W1964094651,"Protoporphyrinogen oxidase, which catalyzes the oxygen-dependent aromatization of protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX, is the molecular target of diphenyl ether type herbicides. The structural gene for the yeast protoporphyrinogen oxidase, HEM14, was isolated by functional complementation of a hem14-1 protoporphyrinogen oxidase-deficient yeast mutant, using a novel one-step colored screening procedure to identify heme-synthesizing cells. The hem14-1 mutation was genetically linked to URA3, a marker on chromosome V, and HEM14 was physically mapped on the right arm of this chromosome, between PRP22 and FAA2. Disruption of the HEM14 gene leads to protoporphyrinogen oxidase deficiency in vivo (heme deficiency and accumulation of heme precursors), and in vitro (lack of immunodetectable protein or enzyme activity). The HEM14 gene encodes a 539-amino acid protein (59,665 Da; pI 9.3) containing an ADP- beta alpha beta-binding fold similar to those of several other flavoproteins. Yeast protoporphyrinogen oxidase was somewhat similar to the HemY gene product of Bacillus subtilis and to the human and mouse protoporphyrinogen oxidases. Studies on protoporphyrinogen oxidase overexpressed in yeast and purified as wild-type enzyme showed that (i) the NH2-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence of protoporphyrinogen oxidase is not cleaved during importation; (ii) the enzyme, as purified, had a typical flavin semiquinone absorption spectrum; and (iii) the enzyme was strongly inhibited by diphenyl ether-type herbicides and readily photolabeled by a diazoketone derivative of tritiated acifluorfen. The mutant allele hem14-1 contains two mutations, L422P and K424E, responsible for the inactive enzyme. Both mutations introduced independently in the wild-type HEM14 gene completely inactivated the protein when analyzed in an Escherichia coli expression system."

https://openalex.org/W1986682746,"Template primers containing propanodeoxyguanosine (PdG) in two different sequence contexts (C-PdG-C and T-PdG-T) were replicated by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The presence of PdG in the template strand reduced the extent of in vitro DNA synthesis 10(3) - 10(4)-fold compared with unmodified template primers. Partial blockade was observed 1 base 3' to the adduct and opposite the adduct. Purines were preferentially incorporated opposite the adduct; the Vmax/Kmvalues for incorporation of dGMP were similar in both sequence contexts, whereas the Vmax/Km for dAMP incorporation increased 4.7-fold when the base pair 3' to PdG was changed from C:G to T:A. Oligonucleotides containing 1- and 2-base deletions were major products of replication in both sequence contexts. Full-length products were observed with templates containing T-PdG-T but not C-PdG-C. The major full-length product resulted from incorporation of dAMP residues opposite PdG. Kinetic analysis revealed that the major factor contributing to the selective incorporation of dAMP in full-length products was preferential extension of template primers containing PdG:dA termini rather than preferential incorporation of dAMP opposite PdG. The observation of PdG --> T mutations in the T-PdG-T context but not the C-PdG-C context during in vitro DNA replication parallels findings of in vivo experiments that base pair substitutions are induced by PdG in the former sequence context but not the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2078775196,"We recently identified a 28-kDa protein in the intestinal brush border that resembled tropomyosin in terms of size, homology, and α helical content. This protein contained 27 heptad repeats, nearly all of which began with leucine, leading to its name zipper protein. Subsequent analysis, however, indicated that both a 49-kDa and a 28-kDa immunoreactive protein existed in intestinal brush-border extracts. Using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis, we extended the N-terminal sequence of zipper protein to the apparent translation start site. This additional sequence contained a putative transmembrane domain and two potential tryptic cleavage sites C-terminal to the transmembrane domain which would release a 28-kDa cytoplasmic protein if utilized. The additional sequence was highly homologous to members of the B-G protein family, a family with no known function. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that zipper protein was confined to the membrane of the microvillus where it was in close association with brush-border myosin 1 (BBM1). Recombinant zipper protein (28-kDa cytoplasmic portion) blocked the binding of actin to BBM1 and inhibited actin-stimulated BBM1 ATPase activity. In contrast, zipper protein had no effect on endogenous or K/EDTA-stimulated BBM1 ATPase activity. Furthermore, zipper protein displaced tropomyosin from binding to actin, suggesting that these homologous proteins bind to the same sites on the actin molecule. We conclude that zipper protein is a transmembrane protein of the B-G family localized to the intestinal epithelial cell microvillus.

INTRODUCTIONThe intestinal brush border contains a highly cell-specific form of myosin 1 called brush-border myosin 1 (BBM1) 1The abbreviations used are: BBM1brush-border myosin 1PBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidDTTdithiothreitolAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride.(1.Mooseker M.S.

Like other myosins, BBM1 has actin-stimulated ATPase activity and, in the presence of ATP and calcium, generates movement along actin filaments(7.Mooseker M.S. Conzelman K.A. Coleman T.R. Heuser J.E.

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). BBM1 is capable of binding both to the actin core and to the membrane of the microvillus(7.Mooseker M.S. Conzelman K.A.

Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Binding to the membrane appears to involve the C-terminal portion of the molecule and requires acidic phospholipids(13.Hayden S.M. Wolenski J.S. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This ability to bind both actin and membranes suggests that BBM1 plays a role in membrane transport(14.Fath K.R. Burgess D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Regulation of the binding of BBM1 to the membrane or to actin is not thoroughly understood. Tropomyosin blocks binding of BBM1 to actin(8.Collins K. Sellers J.R. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), but tropomyosin is not found in the microvilli where BBM1 is located(11.Glenney Jr., J.R. Osborn M. Weber K. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 138: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We (15.Bikle D.D. Munson S. Morrison N. Eisman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 620-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) recently described a protein with structural homology to tropomyosin which at the light microscopic level colocalized with BBM1 to the brush border. Because of its extended leucine zipper motif we call this protein zipper protein. Subsequent to the initial report, we have determined that the originally reported structure is the cytoplasmic tail of a larger protein in the B-G protein family, a family of proteins with no known function. The data in this report indicate that zipper protein is a transmembrane protein of the intestinal microvillus whose cytoplasmic tail regulates the binding of BBM1 to actin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESWestern AnalysisDuodenal mucosa from White leghorn cockerels was extracted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following homogenization, the extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were collected, flash frozen, and stored at −80°C until analyzed. 100-μg aliquots of these samples were subjected to sodium lauryl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (12% gels) and blotted onto PVDF membranes using 10 mM CAPS, pH 10.4, and 2% methanol. For selected experiments, nondenaturing gels were employed in which SDS and DTT were not included in the PAGE. The blots were blocked with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5% non fat dry milk, and 0.05% Tween 20, then incubated overnight with 1/100 × dilution of the following affinity-purified antibodies: 1470 (raised to the epitope KKQYENLASHASE) and 1468 (raised to the epitope RELKRKDAMLGRKD). The first epitope is found near the middle of the cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 351-363 of new sequence, Fig. 1); the second epitope is found near the transmembrane domain and spans the region containing a potential tryptic cleavage site (amino acids 187-200 of new sequence). A third antibody, 1092, raised against the epitope AKQTEEVENHYEE (amino acids 309-321) was used for immunoelectron microscopy and quantitation of zipper protein during the actin/BBM1 binding studies. It gave similar results to 1470 on Western analysis. The production of these antibodies is as described previously (15.Bikle D.D. Munson S. Morrison N. Eisman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 620-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detection utilized the ECL kit by Amersham according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The same blot was used for both antibodies, stripping the blots in between by incubation at 50°C in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS.SequencingTotal RNA was prepared from the duodenal mucosa of White leghorn cockerels by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (16.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62925) Google Scholar). 1-μg aliquots were reverse-transcribed and amplified using the 5′-RACE kit from Life Technologies, Inc. The primer used for the reverse transcriptase reaction was TTTCATACTGTTTCTTCATTA. The nested primer used for polymerase chain reaction amplification was AGTCTAAGCTTTTTCAGTTTGTTTCACCAGTT which contains a HindIII site for subsequent subcloning. A second nested primer used to detect the polymerase chain reaction products and positive clones was TTGCAGCACTTGAATCTAATA. The products were subcloned into pGEM4Z (Promega, Madison, WI) using the SmaI and HindIII sites and sequenced using the Sequenase 2 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). All oligonucleotides used for these procedures were prepared by the Biomolecular Resource Center, University of California, San Francisco. Sequence analysis and homology searches were performed on-line using selected programs in Intelligenetics (Mountain View, CA).Immunoelectron MicroscopyThe jejunum from a 6-week-old White leghorn chicken was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.05 M Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 3.5% sucrose, or in pyridoxal phosphate fixative, containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.075 ML-lysine, 2.4 mg/ml sodium m-periodate in 0.05 M sodium pyrosphate buffer, pH 7.2(17.McLean I.W.

The tissue pieces were fixed at 4°C for 4 h and were processed either for embedding in Lowicryl HM23 for the localization of BBM1 or stored in 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.05 M Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 3.5% sucrose, at 4°C, for localization of zipper protein.The samples for zipper protein localization were cryoprotected in 2.3 M sucrose in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 30 min, then frozen in liquid nitrogen and sectioned using a Leica Ultracut E ultramicrotome, equipped with an FC4E cryoattachment at −100°C(19.Griffiths G.

The sections were first incubated with 50 mM NHCl in PBS for 15 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 5% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, containing 500 mM NaCl (TBS) for 30 min. The grids were then incubated with anti-zipper protein antiserum(1092) or with preimmune serum, diluted 1:25 in TBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 1 h, followed by washing for 30 min. Binding of the antibody was revealed with goat anti-rabbit IgG, conjugated to 15-mm colloidal gold (Zymed). The grids were washed and stained with 0.3% uranyl acetate in 2% methylcellulose.BBM1 was detected on pyridoxal phosphate-fixed tissues, embedded into Lowicryl HM23 resin, polymerized by UV at −25°C. The sections were first incubated with 50 mM NHCl in PBS for 15 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation for 30 min with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% cold water fish skin gelatin (Sigma), 0.0001% Tween 20 in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, containing 500 mM NaCl (blocking buffer). The grids were then incubated with affinity-purified anti-BBM1 antibody, diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h, followed by washing with blocking buffer for 30 min. Binding of the antibody was detected as for zipper protein. The grids were washed and stained sequentially with 2% osmium tetroxide in PBS, 2% uranyl acetate, and 1% lead citrate.All sections were examined and photographed in a Zeiss 10A transmission electron microscope operated at 60 kV.BBM1 PurificationBBM1 was prepared using a modification of the method of Swanljung-Collins et al.(21.Korn E.D. Collins J.H. Maruta H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 85: 357-363Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The duodena of White leghorn cockerels were rinsed with ice-cold saline, then incubated on ice with 10 mM KHPO, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.3, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 0.02% NaN, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The tissues were then placed in 76 mM NaPO, 19 mM KHPO, 12 mM EDTA, pH 7.3, containing DTT, AEBSF, NaN, and the above protease inhibitors for 30 min with stirring. The residual mucosa was scraped off and combined with the eluted cells, washed, and homogenized in 10 mM imidazole chloride, 4 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.3, with DTT, AEBSF, NaN, and the other protease inhibitors. The 800 × g pellet of the homogenate was washed twice in homogenization and twice in wash buffer containing 10 mM imidazole chloride, 75 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.3, with DTT, AEBSF, NaN, and the other protease inhibitors except diisopropyl fluorophosphate. ATP extracts of this preparation were prepared by suspending the pellet in 10 mM imidazole chloride, pH 7.3, 0.2 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl, 5 mM ATP, 1 mM EGTA, pH 6.8, with DTT and AEBSF, and collecting the 100,000 × g supernatant. This extract was chromatographed over Sepharose Cl-4B (5 × 90 cm, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described(21.Korn E.D. Collins J.H. Maruta H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 85: 357-363Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the BBM1 peak was identified by K/EDTA ATPase activity (see below). The second ATPase peak (containing BBM1) was dialyzed into 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.3, 0.1 mM MgCl, 1 mM EGTA, 50 mM NaCl, 10% sucrose, 0.1 mM AEBSF, loaded unto a CM-Sephadex column (2.5 × 20 cm, Pharmacia), washed with the same buffer but containing 1 mM ATP and 1 mM DTT, then batch-eluted with the same buffer but containing 50 mM NaCl and without ATP and DTT. The BBM1 peak was identified by its ATPase activity. The BBM1 peak was then made up to 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.3, 0.1 mM MgCl, 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM NaCl, 10% sucrose, 0.1 mM AEBSF, 1 mM DTT, loaded onto a Mono Q column (Pharmacia), and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 100 to 600 mM in the same buffer used for loading. The peak fractions were diluted with 2 volumes of Mono Q loading buffer (without NaCl), loaded onto a Mono S column (Pharmacia), and eluted with the same linear gradient used for Mono Q. The purity of BBM1 in the peak fractions was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. BBM1 is stable for at least 6 weeks if maintained in the elution buffer (containing approximately 400 mM NaCl) at 4°C.Measurement of Zipper Protein, Actin, and Myosin 1 Levels in Intestinal PreparationsPurified preparations of brush-border membranes were subjected to SDS-PAGE along side purified preparations of BBM1 (prepared as described above), actin (gift from Dr. James Sellers), and zipper protein (prepared as described in (15.Bikle D.D. Munson S. Morrison N. Eisman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 620-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) spanning a range (0.15-10 μg, 0.625-10 μg, 0.00625-0.2 μg, respectively) appropriate for the amounts of these proteins expected to be found in the intestinal preparations. The gels were blotted onto PVDF membranes as described above, and BBM1, actin, and zipper protein were detected using the appropriate antibodies and the ECL detection system described above. Using the densitometric quantitation of the purified proteins to prepare standard curves (linear over the ranges employed for all three proteins), the amounts of these proteins in the brush-border membranes were calculated.BBM1/Actin BindingBBM1 prepared as above, rabbit muscle actin (gift from Dr. James Sellers), and recombinant zipper protein prepared as described previously (15.Bikle D.D. Munson S. Morrison N. Eisman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 620-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were dialyzed into assay buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl. The actin was prepared as a phalloidin:actin mixture at 10:1 molar ratio prior to use in this assay. The assay mixture contained 1 μg of BBM1, 2 μg of actin, 0.2-6 μg of zipper protein, and 0 or 5 mM Tris-ATP in a total volume of 50 μl. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, an aliquot (25 μl) was taken for total protein determination; the remaining 25-μl incubates were centrifuged at 200,000 × g × 45 min, and the supernatants (and totals) were spotted unto PVDF membranes using a slot blot apparatus. The pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The BBM1, actin, and zipper protein in the various fractions were quantitated by Western analysis using the appropriate antibodies as described above. Initial experiments demonstrated that the amount of protein used in these experiments fell within the linear range for detection by this method with quantitative recovery of these proteins in the supernatants.Tropomyosin/Zipper Protein/Actin BindingZipper protein and actin were prepared as described above. Chicken gizzard tropomyosin was purchased from Sigma. The binding buffer included 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl and was used to make up the components of the assay. Initial experiments showed essentially complete binding of 0.3 μg of tropomyosin to 1 μg of actin under the conditions of the experiment. 2 μg of the actin-phalloidin complex was incubated for 10 min at 22°C with varying amounts (0-6 μg) of zipper protein in binding buffer before the addition of 0.6 μg of tropomyosin for an additional 30 min (total volume 50 μl). 25-μl aliquots were removed to assess total levels of the components, then the mixture was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatants and pellets were treated as for the actin/myosin binding experiments; tropomyosin was detected using 1:100 × dilution of anti-tropomyosin raised in rabbits against chicken gizzard tropomyosin (Sigma).ATPase ActivityThe BBM1, actin, and zipper protein were dialyzed into incubation buffer, 10 mM imidazole chloride, pH 7.0, 2 mM MgCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.4 mM DTT. In initial experiments, activation of BBM1 ATPase activity (1 μg of BBM1) was found to be linear over at least 30 μg of actin. For these experiments, 1 μg of BBM1, 10 μg of actin, and 1-30 μg of zipper protein were combined in 20-μl assay volume. The reaction was initiated with a final concentration of 0.1 μCi of [-P]ATP in 1 mM Tris-ATP. The tubes were incubated at 37°C for 60 min, then extracted as described previously(21.Korn E.D. Collins J.H. Maruta H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 85: 357-363Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the released P was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. K/EDTA ATPase activity was measured in similar fashion except that the incubation buffer contained 0.5 M KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM imidazole chloride, pH 7.5, and no actin.RESULTSSubsequent to our initial report(15.Bikle D.D. Munson S. Morrison N. Eisman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 620-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we became aware that our original clones encoding zipper protein may have contained “introns” which interfered with the determination of the beginning of the open reading frame in the 5′ end of the sequence, a frequent occurrence in clones of B-G proteins(22.Miller M.M.

Immunogenetics. 1989; 30: 440-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 2M. M. Miller, personal communication.Therefore, we repeated the sequencing of the 5′ end of zipper protein, using mRNA from gut mucosa (rather than a cDNA library) as starting material, and 5′-RACE technology. Nine clones were fully sequenced in both directions. Although varying in length at the 5′ end, all clones encoded the same protein. The consensus sequence when coupled to the previously determined sequence of zipper protein encoded a protein of 49,272 daltons (374 residues) (Fig. 1). This sequence showed a high degree of homology with the 5′ end of the B-G proteins obtained from an erythroid cell library published by Miller et al.(22.Miller M.M. Goto R. Young S. Chirivella J. Hawke D. Miyada C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4377-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 2.Figure 2Homology of zipper protein and four B-G proteins cloned and sequenced by Miller et al.(22.Miller M.M. Goto R. Young S. Chirivella J. Hawke D. Miyada C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4377-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) from an erythroid cell library. The homology is most striking in the N-terminal half of the proteins which includes the transmembrane domain (amino acids 159-178 of zipper protein).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The hydropathy plot of the N-terminal region of zipper protein (Fig. 3) indicates a 20-amino acid stretch of hydrophobic amino acids (amino acids 159-178) which is highly conserved among the B-G proteins; as seen in Fig. 2, conservative amino acid substitutions are the only differences in the 7 positions not completely homologous among these proteins in this region with the exception of a proline in D39371 instead of an alanine in the other proteins. This likely represents a transmembrane domain. Immediately C-terminal to this putative transmembrane domain is a highly hydrophilic domain (amino acids 179-194) which contains 7 basic residues in pairs or triplets. Proteolytic cleavage in this basic region would release a 28-kDa protein. This region also is highly homologous with the B-G proteins. The homology among the B-G proteins in the remainder of the structure is less well preserved, although all proteins demonstrate the extended leucine zipper motif. The leucine zipper motif suggests that these proteins exist as coiled coils in their C-terminal cytoplasmic domains. Comparing the migration of the C-terminal portion of zipper protein on denaturing versus nondenaturing gels, we found the expected size (28 kDa) on denaturing gels but an apparently much larger protein (approximately 120 kDa) on nondenaturing gels suggesting multimer formation and/or aberrant migration of an asymmetric molecule (data not shown).Figure 3Hydropathy plot of zipper protein. Hydrophobicity is indicated by positive values. Charged residues are indicated by a + or - as appropriate. The boxed region includes the hydrophobic region from amino acids 159-178, the likely transmembrane domain, and a hydrophilic region from amino acids 179-194 which contains a number of basic residues in doublets or triplets providing a likely site for proteolytic cleavage.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether zipper protein existed as the full-length or cleaved product in the intestinal epithelium, we examined extracts of intestinal mucosa by Western analysis using antibodies raised to different regions of the deduced sequence. The results are shown in Fig. 4 in which the same blot is probed with both antibodies. The antibody(1470) raised to a region near the tail of the sequence (amino acids 351-363) detected two proteins, one with the expected size for the cytoplasmic domain of zipper protein (28 kDa) and one substantially larger (49-50 kDa). A second antibody(1468) raised to the basic region adjacent to the putative transmembrane domain (see below) (amino acids 187-200) recognized only the 49-kDa band. Both antibodies recognized only the 49-kDa species in purified brush-border membranes (data not shown). The structure for zipper protein shown in Fig. 1 has a calculated molecular mass of 49.3 kDa, suggesting that it is the complete sequence. The smaller band (28 kDa) detected by antibody 1470 is consistent with cleavage in the polybasic region of zipper protein C-terminal of the transmembrane domain and in a region that would disrupt the epitope recognized by antibody 1468.Figure 4Western analysis of intestinal extracts was performed using two antibodies. 1470 was raised to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain, whereas 1468 was raised to an epitope spanning the putative tryptic cleavage region near the transmembrane domain. The same blot was probed with both antibodies. Each antibody sees the same 49-kDa protein, but 1470 sees a 28-kDa protein as well which we postulate is the cytoplasmic tail of the 49-kDa protein. In this gel, the molecular marker for 49.5 kDa ran slightly below the 49-kDa protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine more precisely the location of zipper protein within the brush border, we performed immunogold localization at the electron microscopic level and compared the results to the immunolocalization of BBM1. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The left panel shows the immunolocalization of zipper protein; the right panel shows the immunolocalization of BBM1. Although BBM1 could be detected in embedded tissue, zipper protein localization at the ultrastructural level required cryosections. The zipper protein was found exclusively in the microvilli of the intestinal epithelial cells where it appeared closely associated with the membrane. No labeling of the basolateral membrane or cytoplasmic organelles was seen. Goblet cells and cells in the submucosa did not express detectable levels of zipper protein. BBM1 was also found exclusively in the microvilli. However, BBM1 had both a membrane-associated and intravesicular localization. As for zipper protein, BBM1 was not found in the intermicrovillar domain of the apical plasma membrane or invaginations of the apical plasma membrane, basolateral membrane, or other subcellular organelles. When the anti-zipper protein or anti-BBM1 antiserum was replaced with preimmune serum, no gold particles were seen over the brush border.Figure 5Immunoelectron microscopic localization of zipper protein and BBM1. The left panel shows the immunolocalization of zipper protein; the right panel shows the immunolocalization of BBM1. The gold particles mark the presence of zipper protein exclusively in the membrane, whereas BBM1 is found within the microvillus as well. Two different methods were required for these two different proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Preabsorption of the antisera eliminated all background staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then assessed the amounts of zipper protein in purified brush-border membranes in comparison with actin and myosin 1. In purified brush-border membranes, zipper protein existed only in the 49-kDa form at a concentration of 0.4 ng/μg of protein, whereas in intestinal extracts its concentration was considerably higher (2.5 ng/μg of protein) and both 49-kDa and 28-kDa forms were present. These data suggest that the cleaved product of zipper protein is lost during purification of the membranes. Actin and myosin were found in purified membranes at a concentration of 47 and 56 ng/μg of protein, respectively.The structure of the presumed cytoplasmic portion of zipper protein resem"

The deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 49 amino acids of Topo III decreases the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, single-stranded DNA, by approximately 2 orders of magnitude and reduces Topo III-catalyzed relaxation of supercoiled DNA and Topo III-catalyzed resolution of DNA replication intermediates to a similar extent. Fusion of the carboxyl-terminal 312 amino acid residues of Topo I onto the truncated molecule stimulates topoisomerase-catalyzed relaxation 15-20-fold, to a level comparable with that of full-length Topo III. However, topoisomerase-catalyzed resolution of DNA replication intermediates was only stimulated 2-3-fold. Therefore, the carboxyl-terminal amino acids of these topoisomerases constitute a distinct and separable domain, and this domain is intimately involved in determining the catalytic properties of these polypeptides."

In the adult rat, MyoD mRNA accumulates predominately in fast-twitch muscle, in particular type IIb and/or IIx fibers, whereas Myogenin mRNA is restricted to slow-twitch type I muscle fibers. Transgenic mice expressing the avian v-ski oncogene from the murine sarcoma virus (MSV) promoter-enhancer display preferential hypertrophy of type IIb fast-twitch muscle apparently because of the restricted expression of the transgene. We tested the hypothesis that preferential interactions of MyoD, as a heterodimer with E12, with the MSV enhancer, which has six E-box targets for MyoD family proteins, could contribute to v-ski gene expression in IIb muscle fibers. A series of quantitative binding studies was performed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to test MyoD-E12 versus Myogenin-E12 binding to the MSV enhancer. Our results indicate that MyoD-E12 binds the MSV enhancer with higher affinity and higher cooperativity than Myogenin-E12. Interestingly, MyoD-E12 bound all of the individual E-boxes tested with positive cooperativity indicating DNA-mediated dimerization of the protein subunits.

Activation of muscle-specific gene expression in vertebrates is controlled by the MyoD family of transcription factors, MyoD, Myogenin, MRF4, and Myf-5, which are exclusively expressed in skeletal muscle (1.Davis R.L.

MyoD family proteins are not thought to form efficient homodimers; rather they readily heterodimerize with other HLH proteins, including the E12 and E47 products of the E2A gene (12.Tapscott S.J.

Heterodimers are capable of activating transcription of muscle-specific genes as a result of binding to the E-box consensus sequence (CANNTG) in muscle-specific enhancers, presumably facilitating the formation of transcription-competent RNA polymerase-promoter complexes.

There is a temporal pattern of expression for the MyoD family members in the mouse: Myf-5 is expressed first, followed shortly after by Myogenin, MyoD, and MRF4. In the neonate, all four proteins are expressed at a time when the fetal isoforms of myosin heavy chain (MyHC), rather than the adult isoforms predominate. Following birth and maturation of innervation, Myf-5 expression is reduced to an undetectable level, whereas MRF4 expression remains relatively high. Interestingly, both MyoD and Myogenin expression is also reduced, however, to different extents in different fiber types. MyoD expression predominates over that of Myogenin in fast-twitch type IIb/IIx muscle fibers, whereas Myogenin is preferentially expressed in slow-twitch type I fibers(20.Voytik S.L. Przyborski M. Badylak S.F. Konieczny S.F. Dev. Dynamics. 1993; 198: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 21.Petropoulos C.J. Payne W. Salter D.W. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3391-3397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During this time, the fetal isoform of MyHC is replaced by the adult isoforms. The fiber type-specific expression of MyoD and Myogenin is responsive to hormonal and neural signals. Denervation of either fiber type results in increased expression of both MyoD and Myogenin, as if the cells are reverting to the fetal form; adult MyHC is reduced, and fetal MyHC is reexpressed. Cross-reinnervation of a slow muscle (soleus) with a fast motor neuron or thyroid hormone treatment, both of which induce transformation to fast-twitch fiber types, increased the level of MyoD expression and lowered Myogenin expression in the affected myofibers (20.Voytik S.L. Przyborski M. Badylak S.F. Konieczny S.F. Dev. Dynamics. 1993; 198: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the bHLH factors regulate different sets of genes in fetal and adult muscle. In the adult, they may be involved in controlling fiber type-specific gene expression in response to external signals. The viral ski gene (v-ski) encodes a nuclear oncoprotein capable of causing morphological transformation, allowing cell growth in soft agar and inducing myogenesis in cultured avian cells(22.Li Y. Turck C.M. Teumer J.K. Stavnezer E. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Colmenares C. Stavnezer E. Cell. 1989; 59: 293-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24.Stavnezer E. Brodeur D. Brennan L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4038-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The avian c-ski proto-oncogene encodes a nuclear protein of unknown function which can bind DNA in the presence of other nuclear proteins(25.Nagase T. Mizuguchi G. Nomura N. Ishizaki R. Ueno Y. Ishii S. Nucleic Acids Rec. 1990; 18: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, when expressed at high levels, similar to that of v-ski during infection, c-ski acquires the oncogenic and myogenic activities of v-ski(26.Colmenares C. Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Stavnezer E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4929-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result led Colmenares et al. (26.Colmenares C. Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Stavnezer E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4929-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to conclude that differences in the level of expression between v-ski and c-ski rather than differences in the encoded proteins per se was sufficient to account for the disparate characteristics of the two evolutionarily related proteins. c-ski expression driven by the promoter-enhancer region of the murine sarcoma virus (MSV) long terminal repeat has unexpected effects in transgenic mice. In three independent lines of mice, hypertrophy of skeletal muscle was observed. One of these lines(8566) was studied in detail, and the hypertrophy of muscle was found to be the result of specific hypertrophy of type IIb fibers, the fastest of the fast-twitch fibers(27.Leferovich J.M. Lana D.P. Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Kelly A.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 596-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). c-ski expression and the hypertrophic phenotype become elevated at approximately 12 days postpartum, the time at which innervation matures, and the adult isoforms of contractile proteins accumulate. c-ski mRNA accumulation in MSV-ski transgenic mice was reduced in denervated hindlimb muscle or in response to chemically induced hypothyroidism(27.Leferovich J.M. Lana D.P. Sutrave P. Hughes S.H. Kelly A.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 596-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The obvious correlation between the expression patterns of the endogenous myoD gene and the MSV-v-ski transgene suggests the possibility that the MSV promoter-enhancer may be responding to MyoD activity specifically in adult IIb muscle fibers. In this case, the MSV enhancer would be a useful tool, not only in studies of differences in MyoD and Myogenin activity, but also for analyses of changes in MyoD activity during development. The idea that MyoD in type IIb fibers may regulate the MSV enhancer is supported by the finding that the bHLH transcription factor E47 can bind and transactivate the murine leukemia virus promoter-enhancer in vivo(28.Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Thomas C.Y. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4142-4148Crossref Google Scholar). The murine leukemia virus and MSV enhancers, as well as those from all type C retroviruses, are highly homologous(29.Golemis E.A. Speck N.A. Hopkins N. J. Virol. 1989; 64: 534-542Crossref Google Scholar). Based on these facts, we postulated that the tissue-specific expression of v-ski in the transgenic mice may result from the action of muscle-specific regulators available in fast fibers but absent in slow fibers, of which MyoD is the most likely candidate. As a first test of this hypothesis, we asked if there were intrinsic differences in the ability of MyoD (fast-specific) and Myogenin (slow-specific) to bind the MSV enhancer. A quantitative, in vitro protein-DNA binding analysis of the MSV enhancer region with MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12 heterodimers was performed. Our results indicate that MyoD-E12 has higher affinity for the MSV enhancer and that it binds with higher cooperativity than Myogenin-E12. Taken together our results indicate that MyoD is likely to contribute to the fast fiber-specific expression of c-ski in transgenic mice. The MSV enhancer region contains six E-boxes that we refer to as E1, E2, etc. from 5′ to 3′ (Fig. 1, A and B). Four overlapping MSV enhancer fragments were amplified using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) with pMSVski plasmid as a template and synthetic primers. pMSVski was the generous gift of Stephen H. Hughes (NCI-FCRDC). The resulting DNA fragments contained sequences from 11-76, 11-152, 51-276, and 127-276 (see Fig. 1). These fragments were cloned into SmaI site of the pUC118 polylinker, generating pPC21, pPC31, pPC41, and pPC52, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned fragments were confirmed. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), DNA fragments were amplified with different combinations of P end-labeled “reverse” and “-20” universal primers complementary to sequences in the pUC vector and primers complementary to the MSV enhancer (Fig. 1B). DNA fragments E23 and E6, which contain MSV enhancer sequences from 86-124, and 212-241, respectively, were synthesized. Fragment E2 was created with synthetic oligonucleotides for E23 fragment where E3-box was mutated (described below). Other DNA fragments with mutated E-boxes were amplified using mutagenic primers and either the reverse or −20 primers. Mutagenic primers were designed to introduce T C and G A base transitions in the targeted E-box sequences (CANNTG CANNCA). These mutations were effective in abolishing MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12 binding to DNA fragments containing a single mutated E-box (data not shown). Fragments E2345 and E45 were generated by BfaI restriction enzyme digestion of E23456 and E456 fragments, respectively. Control DNA that contained the pUC118 polylinker region amplified with reverse and −20 primers was used as a negative control in EMSA. Also, a control DNA fragment with an E-box positioned near the end of the DNA fragment showed no differences in binding affinity for either protein compared with a similar DNA fragment with the E-box more centrally located (data not shown). All synthetic DNAs were made with a Milligen Expedite DNA Synthesizer by the UAMS Molecular Biology Core Facility and were end labeled with [-P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase prior to polymerase chain reaction or annealing. Radioactive DNA substrates for EMSA were gel purified, and the concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Full-length mouse MyoD, Myogenin, and E12 proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DELysS) from T7 expression plasmids. Plasmids pT5-MyoD and pT5-E12 were the generous gifts of Charles P. Emerson, Jr. (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). Purified Myogenin was the generous gift of Soheila J. Maleki (University of Arkansas Medical Sciences). The expression and purification of MyoD, Myogenin, and E12 will be described elsewhere. 2S. J. Maleki and B. K. Hurlburt, manuscript in preparation.The three proteins were judged to be approximately 90-95% pure following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Small aliquots of purified protein were stored at −20°C and thawed freshly for each experiment. The concentrations of MyoD, Myogenin, and E12 were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 17,750, 21,980 and 17,900 M, respectively. Proteins for heterodimer experiments were diluted from frozen stocks to 800 nM on ice in MCK buffer (10 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.9, 80 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol). Equal volumes of MyoD or Myogenin were mixed with E12, and the resulting solutions were equilibrated for 20 min at room temperature. Protein samples were prepared in 2-fold dilutions from 400 nM to 50 pM and mixed with equal volumes of DNA substrates diluted to 20 pM in MCK buffer. Thus, binding reactions contained 10 pM DNA and proteins in concentrations ranging from 25 pM to 200 nM, with respect to the heterodimer. Binding reactions were allowed to equilibrate for at least 30 min prior to electrophoresis. Native, 1-mm thick, 6% acrylamide gels (50:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 1 × TBE (89 mM Tris borate, 2 mM EDTA) were prepared in Protean IIxi (Bio-Rad) cooled apparatus at least 1 h prior to electrophoresis and prerun at 200 V constant voltage to reach a constant current of approximately 18 mA. Gel temperature was maintained at 17°C with a water bath circulator at all times. Binding reactions were loaded on running gels, and then the voltage was raised to 250 V. Resolved gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 7% methanol for 15 min and dried. Gels were exposed to Reflection x-ray film (DuPont) for 12 h and 72 h at −70°C with intensifying screens. During development of the EMSA we tested several different concentrations of acrylamide and various temperatures. Higher concentrations of acrylamide decreased the absolute value and compressed the range of the apparent binding constants presumably because of “caging effects”(30.Lane D. Prentki P. Chandler M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 509-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also tested temperatures ranging from 17 to 24°C for EMSA. DNA complexes with MyoD-E12 were much more stable at the elevated temperatures than Myogenin-E12; however, both complexes were quite stable in the EMSA at 17°C (data not shown). Undersaturated films from the 12-h exposure were developed, scanned by an Image Densitometer (Bio-Rad), and the relative optical densities of free DNA bands were measured. Apparent amounts of bound DNA were calculated and plotted against respective protein concentrations. The resulting data were fitted with a sigmoidal (power logistic) function using Origin (MicroCal). A1-A21+(xx0)P+A2(Eq. 1) In this function, A1 is the initial y axis level, A2 is the final y axis level, x is the center point of the curve, and p is the rate of increase or slope of the curve. Our analysis of theoretical binding curves for single and multiple protein/DNA interactions showed that the variable p exponent existing in the sigmoidal fitting function can be used as a relative measure of binding cooperativity. A p value of 1.0 indicates no cooperativity; p > 1 or p <1 indicates positive or negative cooperativity, respectively; and the magnitude of p is indicative of the degree of cooperativity. It is important to note that the p value is a relative value describing the slope of the fitted curve and is not directly related to the Hill coefficient. For the purposes of this work, we define the binding constant (K) as the concentration of protein required to bind 50% of the total concentration of DNA. We use the term K rather than K because we are considering multiple equilibria where either MyoD or Myogenin is interacting with another protein, E12, and binding to multiple, nonequivalent target sites. Considering a single binding site, there are at least two formal types of equilibrium which could be occurring. The MyoD family of proteins is commonly thought to bind as dimers, in which case, there is a monomer-dimer equilibrium, for example MyoX (MyoD or Myogenin) dimerizing with E12, described as follows.whereKD=[MyoX][E12][MyoX-E12] There is also a protein-DNA equilibrium, for example MyoX-E12 interacting with DNA, described as follows.whereKD=[MyoX-E12][DNA][MyoX-E12-DNA] Since there are no data currently to describe the protein/protein interactions, we are unable to assign accurate values to the dissociation constant for the protein/DNA interaction. Alternatively, the proteins may bind the target DNA successively as monomers, as described.whereKD=[MyoX][E 12][DNA][MyoX-E12-DNA] In this case, the units of K would be M2 and cannot be derived directly from our data. The MSV enhancer region under study contains six E-box sequences, which were numbered from 1 to 6 starting from the 5′ end (E1, E2, etc; Fig. 1). DNA binding sites for six different nuclear factors were previously identified in the same region (Fig. 1A). To examine MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12 binding properties to DNA targets containing multiple E-box motifs, we created sets of nested deletion DNA fragments. The DNA fragment containing all six E-boxes (E123456) was too large for EMSA. Therefore, the first set contained DNA fragments where E-boxes were successively deleted from the 5′ end of the E23456 fragment. A second set of nested deletions was generated from the 3′ end of fragment E23456. Another 3′ set of deletions was analyzed on parent DNA fragment E123 to test the contributions of E1. Using the EMSA described in the previous section, we measured apparent equilibrium binding constants (K) for protein-DNA complexes formed with MyoD-E12 or Myogenin-E12 heterodimers and MSV enhancer fragments. The results of our saturation experiments for 5′ deletions of fragment E23456 in which a limiting amount of DNA (10 pM) was incubated with increasing concentrations of MyoD-E12 or Myogenin-E12 (25 pM to 200 nM) are shown in Fig. 2, C and D. A representative autoradiogram for MyoD-E12 interactions with the E23456 DNA fragment is presented in Fig. 2A and for Myogenin-E12 interactions with the E3456 DNA fragment in Fig. 2B. The unbound DNA signal was quantitated by densitometry, and the percentage of bound DNA was plotted versus the concentration of protein used (Fig. 2, C and D). For all saturation experiments, the concentration of protein required to shift 50% of the DNA was taken as the K. The apparent binding constants for the parent E23456 fragment in this set were 0.2 nM and 0.3 nM for MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12, respectively. The K values for MyoD-E12 increased 16-fold from 0.2 nM for the E23456 fragment to 3.2 nM for the E6 fragment (Table 1). There were only very slight changes in K when E3 or E5 was deleted from the fragments, indicating that these E-boxes do not contribute significantly to binding affinity by MyoD-E12. The changes in the p value in Table 1 for MyoD-E12 do not correlate with changes in affinity. Although removal of E2 from the target DNA increases the K 4-fold, there is no significant change in cooperativity. However, deletions of E3 and E4 reduce the positive cooperativity of binding.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The 15-fold increase in K for Myogenin-E12, as a result of deleting all but E2 from the parent E23456 fragment, is similar to that of MyoD-E12, and the absolute values for K are similar (Table 1). However, the large increase in K (10-fold) caused by deleting E2 indicates that this E-box is perhaps the most important for Myogenin-E12 binding. The presence of E4 in the fragment does not enhance Myogenin-E12 binding as it did for MyoD-E12. The p values determined from the curves in Fig. 2D indicate that there is positive cooperativity in binding for all DNA fragments tested except E6, but less than that observed for MyoD-E12 binding to the same fragments. The results obtained for MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12 complexes with 5′ deletion DNA fragments showed that the presence of E2 increases the affinity of Myogenin-E12 binding, whereas both E2 and E4 enhance formation of MyoD-E12-DNA complexes. Our experiments also indicated that cooperative binding is important in the formation of complexes with these proteins, but it is most pronounced for MyoD-E12. To test these ideas further, we analyzed MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12 binding with 3′ deletion fragments of the MSV enhancer using assays performed as described above for the 5′ deletion fragments. A representative autoradiogram for MyoD-E12 interactions with the E234 DNA fragment is shown in Fig. 3A and for Myogenin-E12 interactions with the E2345 DNA fragment in Fig. 3B. The data from densitometric analysis are presented in Fig. 3, C and D. The values for K and cooperativity are summarized in Table 2. The parent E23456 fragment in this set was the same as in 5′ deletion group. For MyoD-E12, deletion of E6 caused a 12-fold decrease in affinity, and binding was less cooperative. Removal of E5, generating the E234 fragment, almost completely restored binding to the level observed with E23456 (K = 0.3 nM), but without the high level of cooperativity observed in binding the E23456 fragment. Subsequent deletion of E4 resulted in a fragment (E23) that was bound by MyoD-E12 with nearly the same affinity and cooperativity as for fragment E2345. Finally, deletion of E3, creating fragment E2 with only one E-box, lowered binding affinity and cooperativity relative to E23.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Deletion of E6 from the E23456 fragment reduced the affinity of Myogenin-E12 binding very much like it did MyoD-E12 binding with an increase in K of approximately 12-fold but without the concomitant reduction in cooperativity. There was a slight increase in affinity, approximately 2-fold, when E5 was removed, leaving E234. Removal of E4 had devastating effects on binding: the E23 and E2 fragments were bound by Myogenin-E12 with K values of 26 and 23 nM, respectively, and all positive cooperativity of binding was lost. Since fragment E123456 was too large for EMSA we tested the contribution of E1 in enhancer binding using E123 as the parent fragment and removed E-boxes from the 3′ end. A representative autoradiogram for MyoD-E12 interactions with the E123 DNA fragment is shown in Fig. 4A and for Myogenin-E12 interactions with the E123 DNA fragment in Fig. 4B. The data from the densitometric analysis are presented in Fig. 4, C and D, and the derived values for K and cooperativity are summarized in Table 3. MyoD-E12 bound the E123 with a K of 3.7 nM and modest positive cooperativity. Unexpectedly, the E12 fragment was bound with nearly 4-fold higher affinity (K = 1 nM), as if E3 had a negative effect on fragment binding. Removal of E2 from the E12 fragment had no significant difference in affinity. Myogenin-E12 bound the E123 fragment with nearly the same affinity as by MyoD-E12, whereas removal of E3 caused a nearly 5-fold increase in K. Fragment E1 was bound by Myogenin-E12 with the same affinity as E123. These data indicate that the presence of E3 has opposite effects on binding by MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12. The results from the deletion of E3 from fragment E23456 do not corroborate the effects of E3 deletion from fragment E123. Thus, there must be contributions to binding from the context of the various E-boxes.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To clarify the contributions of the individual E-boxes in the MSV enhancer to binding by MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12, we tested internal mutations of E2, E3, E4, and E5 using the EMSA. A representative autoradiogram of MyoD-E12 interactions with the E13 DNA fragment is shown in Fig. 5A and of Myogenin-E12 interactions with the E13 DNA fragment in Fig. 5B. The binding profiles are shown in Fig. 5, C and D, and the derived values for and K and p are presented in Table 4. Compared with the E123 fragment, the E13 fragment was bound with slightly higher affinity by MyoD-E12, but only 10% as well by Myogenin-E12. Thus, E2, in this context, has significant and opposite effects on MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12 interactions. Mutation of E3 within an E23456 parent fragment caused a small reduction in MyoD-E12 binding affinity and a much larger 15-fold loss in Myogenin-E12 binding. Compared with the E2345 fragment, the E235 fragment was bound with approximately 4-fold higher affinity by MyoD-E12 and with slightly increased affinity by Myogenin-E12. Removal of E5 from the E456 fragment had no significant effects on MyoD-E12 binding but increased Myogenin-E12 binding 4-fold. Taken together, the results from all of the EMSA experiments indicate that contributions of the various E-boxes within the MSV enhancer differ with respect to MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12 as well as with the context of the DNA fragment that encompasses them.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab We tested the hypothesis that MSV-v-ski transgene expression in fast-twitch muscle fibers was responsive to MyoD activity by examining the DNA binding characteristics of MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12 (slow fiber-specific) for the MSV enhancer in vitro. The results reported here are our initial analyses of this system and indicate complex interactions between these proteins bound to the six E-boxes in terms of affinity and cooperativity. Further analyses will be required to understand fully the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating expression of the MSV enhancer-promoter. Nevertheless, our results clearly indicate that MyoD-E12 bound nearly all of the DNA fragments tested with higher affinity and higher cooperativity than Myogenin-E12. Thus, we conclude that fiber type IIb-specific expression of MSV-ski in transgenic mice likely results in part from activation by MyoD, which preferentially accumulates in these fibers. MyoD-E12 binding to all the DNA fragments containing single E-boxes (E1, E2, or E6) showed positive cooperativity, whereas only E1 was bound by Myogenin-E12 cooperatively (Table I–III). In addition, MyoD-E12 bound all and Myogenin-E12 bound most of the DNA fragments containing multiple E-boxes with cooperativity. Thus, there are multiple contributions of cooperativity to DNA binding for these transcription factors. These results are strikingly similar to the interactions of repressor with O1, O2, and O3(31.Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch. Cell Press and Blackwell Scientific Publications, San Francisco, CA1986Google Scholar). repressor dimerization is enhanced by DNA binding, thus there is cooperativity observed in binding a single operator. Repressor also shows cooperativity in binding tandemly arranged target DNAs, via protein/protein interactions between repressor bound to O1 and O2. Binding to O3 is not cooperative, however, because repressor at O2 interacting with repressor at O1 cannot interact with repressor at O3. However, mutations in O1, which disallow repressor binding, promote repressor binding to O2 and O3 with cooperativity. Such high levels of cooperativity dramatically increase the regulatory response due to small changes in protein concentration or activation (31.Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch. Cell Press and Blackwell Scientific Publications, San Francisco, CA1986Google Scholar). Cooperativity of dimeric protein interactions with a single DNA target site can arise from two distinct mechanisms. The stepwise binding of monomers can show cooperativity by increasing the affinity of binding for the second monomer in the presence of the first bound monomer. For example, this is what is observed for the glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain. 3J. Hill and C. A. Royer, personal communication.Alternatively, cooperativity can also arise for binding of dimeric proteins to a single binding site if protein dimerization is significantly enhanced by DNA binding. It should also be noted that these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive; both can be occurring. Although our results show cooperativity in binding a single site, they do not help distinguish between whether these proteins bind DNA as dimers, stepwise as monomers, or both. We are currently conducting experiments to clarify the mode of binding utilized by MyoD-E12. Studies on DNA recognition by bHLH muscle transcription factors showed that the CANNTG E-box sequence establishes a minimal DNA binding site for these proteins. Consensus DNA recognition sequences for MyoD-E12 heterodimer (32.Blackwell K.T. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 23: 1104-1110Crossref Scopus (759) Google Scholar) and Myogenin homodimer (and heterodimer with E12 as proposed in (33.Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar)) derived in affinity selection experiments show a high level of similarity. The MSV enhancer contains six E-box sequences. Four of the E-boxes (E2, E4, E5, E6) have the sequence CAGATG, which is different from the consensus sequences determined in selection experiments for either MyoD or Myogenin, but is present in enhancers of muscle-specific promoters (34.Zingg J.M. Pedraza G.M. Jost J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6433-6439Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 35.Vaidya T.B. Rhodes S.J. Moore J.L. Sherman D.A. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36.Yee S.P. Rigby P.W. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Two of the E-boxes (E1, E3) have the sequence CAGCTG, matching the consensus binding site from selection experiments with Myogenin. The crystal structure of the MyoD bHLH domain-DNA complex (8.Ma P.C.M. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) revealed protein contacts with the bases of the primary E-box determinants, CA and TG, and some contacts to 5′- and 3′-flanking residues in the double-stranded TCAACAGCTGTTGA DNA, indicating that specific bases outside an E-box may be involved in recognition and binding. It has also been postulated that the central two bases of the E-box motif could contribute to distinct MyoD and Myogenin-DNA binding preferences. Binding site selection experiments showed that Myogenin has a preference for a symmetrical binding site, whereas MyoD binding sequences showed a nonpalindromic distribution of bases in central NN bases of an E-box. In general, our results show only slight differences in affinity for both proteins in combination with E12 binding to single E-box containing DNA fragments (except for E2) and that binding occurs with low to moderate affinity. Thus, MyoD and Myogenin prefer similar DNA targets and bind them with similar affinity. On the other hand, numerous in vivo experiments have shown that MyoD and Myogenin have distinct functions in the regulation of muscle-specific gene expression. One proposed solution to this apparent contradiction is that heterodimerization, rather than homodimerization, with other bHLH proteins such as ubiquitous E12 and E47 or Id, leads to MyoD- or Myogenin-specific gene activation or inactivation. It has also been shown that other regulatory DNA elements in combination with E-box sequences can differentially contribute to muscle-specific gene activation(37.Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These regulatory models, although attractive and well documented, share one weakness: namely, E-box sequences are widespread in genomes (average of one E-box in 256 bases) and are present in the promoters of genes not specifically expressed in muscle. Nevertheless, it has been shown that under certain experimental conditions a single E-box motif can be responsible for Myogenin-dependent gene activation(38.Edmondson D.G. Cheng T.C. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In our studies, we showed that MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12 DNA binding affinity to targets containing multiple E-box sequences is much higher than interactions of these proteins with single DNA fragments containing a single E-box. This indicates that multiple E-box motifs, when present in promoter regions, could contribute to high affinity DNA binding for these proteins and simultaneously provide an additional level to MyoD and Myogenin DNA recognition specificity. Cooperative binding of MyoD-E47 to DNA targets containing multiple E-box motifs (39.Bengal E. Flores O. Rangarajan N. Chen A. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6221-6225Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and E-box cooperation in the promoter of the rat acetylcholine receptor subunit gene(40.Berberich C. Durr I. Koenen M. Witzemann V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 41.Simon A.M. Burden S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5133-5140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) enhance transcriptional activity. We demonstrated that mutations of certain E-box sequences within MSV enhancer significantly reduce affinity of MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12 in cooperative DNA binding presumably through lack of communication between proteins. Conversely, the same situation could arise in vivo when two or more transcriptionally active proteins compete for overlapping DNA recognition sites. This competition could result in a delicate balance of repression and activation. Such a situation can be easily predicted in the case of MSV enhancer, where E2 and E4 constitute internal parts of the glucocorticoid response element. Binding of the glucocorticoid receptor in response to steroid hormone treatment could inhibit MyoD-E12 or Myogenin-E12 binding. In fact, clinical application of glucocorticoids in cancer therapy leads to repression of muscle-specific gene expression and a loss of muscle mass(42.Seene T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 50: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There are similar sequence relationships in other muscle-specific promoters where, in addition to glucocorticoid response element/E-box overlapping motifs, other transcription factor binding sites (e.g. LVa, Ets-1) consistently share the same stretch of bases with E-box sequences. We have reported the results from an initial probe into the interactions of transcription factors with the MSV enhancer. It is clear from our results that complex protein/protein interactions and protein/DNA interactions are likely to contribute to enhancer activity. Specifically, cooperativity of binding plays a much larger role than previously expected. Currently, we are pursuing experiments that will further address the mechanisms contributing to cooperative binding, the biological relevance of MyoD-E12 and Myogenin-E12 DNA binding within MSV enhancer, and for possible modulation of MSV enhancer activity through glucocorticoid receptor/MyoD, Myogenin competition for their DNA binding sites.

https://openalex.org/W2013913215,"The mouse mammary tumor virus env gene contains a transcriptional activator (META) that can control transcription of the adjacent long terminal repeat region. Transcriptional control by META parallels that of several lymphokine genes, being specific to T cells, dependent on their activation, and inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine (CsA). DNase I footprinting indicated that nuclear factors from activated T lymphocytes bound a promoter-proximal site, META(P), and a promoter-distal site, META(D+), within the 400-base pair META region. Nuclear factors from unstimulated, but not from activated cells, bound a site, META(D-), adjacent to META(D+). META(D+) directed transcription of a linked luciferase gene, and gel shift analysis revealed binding of inducible, CsA-sensitive T cell factors, in parallel with transfection results. Authentic NFAT and NF-κB targets did not compete for the META(D+) binding factor(s). The SV40 core sequence competed for META(D+) binding factors, but META(D+) failed to compete for the complexes obtained with the SV40 probe. Our results, taken together, indicate that META(D+) is a novel transcriptional enhancer element that is similar in its cell-type specificity, activation dependence, and CsA sensitivity to the NFAT element. It may be relevant to the role of MMTV in expression of Mls antigens or the induction of T cell lymphomas. The mouse mammary tumor virus env gene contains a transcriptional activator (META) that can control transcription of the adjacent long terminal repeat region. Transcriptional control by META parallels that of several lymphokine genes, being specific to T cells, dependent on their activation, and inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine (CsA). DNase I footprinting indicated that nuclear factors from activated T lymphocytes bound a promoter-proximal site, META(P), and a promoter-distal site, META(D+), within the 400-base pair META region. Nuclear factors from unstimulated, but not from activated cells, bound a site, META(D-), adjacent to META(D+). META(D+) directed transcription of a linked luciferase gene, and gel shift analysis revealed binding of inducible, CsA-sensitive T cell factors, in parallel with transfection results. Authentic NFAT and NF-κB targets did not compete for the META(D+) binding factor(s). The SV40 core sequence competed for META(D+) binding factors, but META(D+) failed to compete for the complexes obtained with the SV40 probe. Our results, taken together, indicate that META(D+) is a novel transcriptional enhancer element that is similar in its cell-type specificity, activation dependence, and CsA sensitivity to the NFAT element. It may be relevant to the role of MMTV in expression of Mls antigens or the induction of T cell lymphomas.

The relatively large and complex long terminal repeat (LTR) is implicated in all three responses. Enhancers in the LTR activate cellular proto-oncogenes to induce tumorigenesis in mammary tumors(1.Peters G. Lee A.E. Dickson C. Nature. 1986; 320: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MMTV variants that induce T lymphomas rather than mammary adenocarcinomas carry large deletions of LTR sequences(2.Ball J.K. Diggelmann H. Dekaban G.A. Grossi G.F. Semmler R. Waight P.A. Fletcher R.F. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whose absence or modification is necessary for T cell tumors to develop(3.Yanagawa S.I. Kakimi K. Tanaka H. Murakami A. Nakagawa Y. Kubo Y. Yamada Y. Hiai H. Kuribayashi K. Masuda T. Ishimoto A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 112-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). And in the case of the minor Mls antigens, the LTR encodes the protein antigen in one of several forms(4.Beutner U. Frankel W.N. Cote M.S. Coffin J.M. Huber B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5432-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 5.Choi Y. Kappler J.W. Marrack P. Nature. 1991; 350: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In each of these three systems, there is a requirement for MMTV-related transcriptional activity in lymphocytes, although the molecular mechanisms regulating transcription control may differ between them. The requirement for expression in lymphocytes includes the induction of tumors by the mammotropic strains of MMTV, as part of the mechanism of transmission to the mammary epithelium. This participation requires expression of the virally encoded Mls antigen(6.Esser U. Parham P. Nature. 1992; 359: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The LTR contains strong, corticosteroid-inducible transcriptional activator elements(7.Chandler V.L. Maler B. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1983; 33: 489-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), but it is not clear what their role is, if any, in transcriptional control in lymphocytes.The LTR of MMTV resembles that of other retroviruses in that it contains the transcriptional control elements and start site for viral RNA synthesis. We have described a second, novel promoter located in the env gene of MMTV, which is activated in certain T lymphoma cell lines (8.Elliott J.F. Pohajdak B. Talbot D.J. Shaw J. Paetkau V. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1373-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Miller C.L. Garner R. Paetkau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3262-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This promoter generates transcripts of the LTR found in the mouse EL4.E1 cell line(8.Elliott J.F. Pohajdak B. Talbot D.J. Shaw J. Paetkau V. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1373-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Kwon B.S. Weissman S.M. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 1000-1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which the amplified genomic copies of MMTV provirus contain a large deletion typical of these lymphomas. The starting point of the transcript lies at position 7247 in the MMTV map, within the env gene (8.Elliott J.F. Pohajdak B. Talbot D.J. Shaw J. Paetkau V. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1373-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Miller C.L. Garner R. Paetkau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3262-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). The relevant promoter is apparently controlled by the sequence immediately upstream of it in the env gene. The transcriptional activity of a 411-bp env gene segment (Fig. 1b), which we term META (for MMTV env transcriptional activator) was established by transient transfection experiments(9.Miller C.L. Garner R. Paetkau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3262-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and it was further shown that this activity resembled closely the activity of the interleukin 2 (IL2) promoter in the same cells. It was restricted to T helper lymphocytes, it was dependent on cellular activation through antigen receptors or their mimics, and its induction was inhibited by the drug cyclosporine (CsA). META was active in mouse and human T lymphocyte cell lines that resemble T helper cells by being inducible for lymphokine synthesis, including mouse EL4.E1 cells, a mouse T hybridoma cell line, and the human Jurkat cell line. It was not active in HeLa cells, or, under the conditions studied, in a mouse B cell line or a cytotoxic T lymphocyte cell line. The env gene was shown to contain both a transcriptional activator and a start site for mRNA synthesis. In this paper, we have examined META for interactions with activation-induced DNA-binding factors and have identified an element that can account for the transcriptional control properties of the env gene itself.The induction of transcription from the META promoter resembles the activation of IL2 transcription in the same cells. Expression of the IL2 gene in T helper lymphocytes is controlled primarily by the sequence lying within 300 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (15.Ullman K.S. Northrop J.P. Verweij C.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 421-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 16.Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors interact with this region, including AP1, AP3, Oct-1, NF-κB, and NFAT(13.Serfling E. Barthelmas R. Pfeuffer I. Schenk B. Zarius S. Swoboda R. Mercurio F. Karin M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17.Durand D.B. Shaw J.-P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 18.Hentsch B. Mouzaki A. Pfeuffer I. Rungger D. Serfling E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The NF-κB and NFAT sites show activation-dependent binding with their relevant factors in vivo(19.Brunvand M.W. Krumm A. Groudine M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4824-4829Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). NFAT is the most sensitive of these sites to CsA, as its binding factor is completely blocked by the drug. Both NF-κB and AP3 are somewhat less sensitive(20.Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B. Higgins K.M. Lacy E. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 246: 1617-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The META region contains several transcription factor binding motifs, but none with the exact NFAT sequence of the human IL2 gene (Fig. 1c). Thus, it was of interest to determine whether an element could be identified that accounted for the characteristic transcriptional activating properties of META. This paper describes in detail such an element, which we term META(D+).MATERIALS AND METHODSCellsJurkat (human T cell leukemia), EL4.E1 (mouse T-lymphoma), S194 (mouse myeloma), and HeLa (endothelial carcinoma) cell lines were maintained in RHFM medium comprising RPMI 1640, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, antibiotics, and 10% fetal bovine serum(9.Miller C.L. Garner R. Paetkau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3262-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Nuclear ExtractsJurkat cells were stimulated for 4-6 h with 15 ng/ml 12-phorbol 13-myristate acetate (PMA) plus 1.5 μM ionomycin, or with PMA plus 0.5 μM A23187. IL2 was measured by bioassay(21.Hooton J.W.L. Gibbs C. Paetkau V. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 2464-2473PubMed Google Scholar). CsA was present at 100 ng/ml where indicated. Nuclear extracts from unstimulated and stimulated cells were prepared by the lysolecithin lysis method(22.Zerivitz K. Akusjarvi G. Gene Anal. Tech. 1989; 6: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. Protein concentrations in cell extracts were determined with a Coomassie protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).DNA Methodology and ReagentsRestriction enzyme digestions, DNA polymerase reactions, ligations, end labeling, agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), gel elution of DNA fragments, and Sephadex G-50 spin column chromatography were carried out by standard protocols(23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.79-7.83Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were obtained from the DNA synthesis facilities of either the Departments of Microbiology or Biochemistry at the University of Alberta. Molecular biological reagents and enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Burlington, ON), the luciferase reporter vector pGL2 from Promega (Madison, WI), Maxam-Gilbert chemical sequencing kit from DuPont NEN, and the Maxi Plasmid DNA purification kit from Qiagen Inc. (Charlesworth, CA). PMA, ionomycin, A23187, luciferin, acetyl coenzyme A, and DNase I enzyme were purchased from Sigma. CsA was a gift from Sandoz Canada Inc. (Dorval, Quebec).DNA sequences were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers described in Table 1, carrying the prefixes S (for sense orientation) and A (for antisense). Primers and templates were heat denatured and annealed(23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.79-7.83Google Scholar). Typical conditions for the PCR were: 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 0.01% gelatin, 3.0 mM MgCl, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 80 nM primers, 6.25 ng of plasmid template, and 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase, in a total volume of 50 μl. The Hybaid thermal reactor (Bio/Can Scientific, Toronto, ON) was programmed for the following conditions: 96°C for 5 min, then two cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 45°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min; followed by 25 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min; and ending with an extension reaction at 72°C for 3 min. PCR products were separated by PAGE in 1 × TBE (89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab PlasmidsNumbering of META segments is based on the transcriptional start site of the META-driven promoter in MMTV(9.Miller C.L. Garner R. Paetkau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3262-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Construction of the plasmid pBLCAT2-C30 containing META sequences from −29 to −439 (Fig. 1b) has been described(9.Miller C.L. Garner R. Paetkau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3262-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Plasmids pGL2 promoter and control vectors are the luciferase reporter plasmids containing the SV40 promoter, and the SV40 promoter plus enhancer, respectively. Plasmid pDS-tk13 has the thymidine kinase (tk) promoter in place of the SV40 promoter in the pGL2 promoter vector background, and was constructed as follows. Plasmids pBLCAT2-C30 and pGL2 promoter vectors were digested with BglII and HindIII, respectively, and the recessed ends were filled in using the Klenow DNA polymerase enzyme. Linearized, blunt-ended pBLCAT-C30 was cut with BamHI to yield the 411-bp META fragment, a 168-bp tk promoter fragment, and a 4.3-kb vector DNA fragment. Digestion of the linearized, blunt-ended pGL2 promoter vector with BglII yielded a 203-bp fragment containing the SV40 promoter and 5.59-kb vector DNA fragment. The tk promoter fragment generated from pBLCAT-30, and the linearized pGL2 vector segment lacking the SV40 promoter were purified on agarose gels and ligated to yield the pDS-tk13 enhancerless luciferase reporter vector.A number of double-stranded DNAs were prepared by PCR amplification using primers described in Table 1. META(D+) DNA with protruding 5′ AA (S21) and TT (A21) termini were first filled in using Klenow DNA polymerase and then blunt-end ligated for 16 h at 14°C to generate multimers. These were cloned upstream of the tk promoter in pDS-tk13 to generate recombinant plasmids pDSD61 to pDSD65 (see Fig. 5). The head-to-tail configuration of the META(D+) segments generated a HpaI restriction enzyme site, which was used in conjunction with other methods to determine the orientation and copy number of D(+) enhancer constructs (head-to-head and tail-to-tail configurations lack the HpaI site). Plasmid pDSM25F is a luciferase reporter plasmid derived from pDS-tk13 harboring the META fragment extending from −29 to −429 upstream of the tk promoter. The complete META fragment (411 bp) was liberated from pBLCAT2-C30 by SalI digestion, purified by PAGE, and ligated into XhoI-cut pDS-tk13 to generate pDSM25F. Human genomic IL2 sequences from −98 to −362 or from +45 to −180 relative to the transcription start site were amplified by PCR using primer pairs S17 and A17 (for −98 to −362) or S16 and A16 (for +45 to −180) (Table 1). The hIL2 PCR product for −98 to −362 region was gel-purified, digested with EcoR I and HindIII, and ligated into pGEM-3Z vector cut with EcoRI and HindIII. The ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α, and plated on LB agar-ampicillin indicator plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside and isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for blue/white colony selection. White colonies were selected, and the recombinant plasmid pDIL2 thus generated was purified and sequenced. Recombinant constructs were confirmed by both sequencing and/or restriction digestion analysis.Figure 5Inducible and CsA-suppressible expression of META(D+)-luciferase constructs in Jurkat cells. The structures of the plasmids used are schematically shown to the left of the graph that depicts their induction by PMA plus A23187. Plasmid pGL-2 control vector contained an SV40 promoter and enhancer. All other plasmids were expressed under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter (tk prm). The compositions of the plasmids were as follows: pDSM25F, complete META region, containing a single copy of META(D+); pDSD 63, pDSD 69, pDSD 61, pDSD 65, plasmids containing the 39-bp META (D+) element in 3-7 copies upstream of the tk promoter, in the orientations indicated by arrows. Rel. fold induction represents the induced/uninduced signals for a given construct, relative to the same ratio for the appropriate enhancerless promoter. The actual values of the luciferase assay are given in the table at the bottom of the figure (light units/10 μg of protein in the assay). pGL-2 and pDS-tk13 are the enhancerless promoters of SV40 and thymidine kinase, respectively. The luciferase expression values for the plasmids induced in the presence of CsA are also given in the table (bottom row), with the expression in CsA relative to the maximum in parentheses. Data are presented from a single transfection experiment, but similar results were observed in at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DNase I Footprint AnalysisPlasmid pBLCAT2-C30 was used as a source of META (−439 to −29, Fig. 1b). For upper strand labeling, the plasmid was linearized with XbaI, dephosphorylated, and end-labeled using [-P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase I. Radiolabeled DNA was separated from unincorporated label on a Sephadex G50 spin column. PstI digestion of this DNA resulted in 528-bp labeled META fragment with flanking vector sequences, a 9-bp labeled PstI-XbaI fragment from the multicloning site, and the remaining 4363-bp vector DNA. The lower strand of META was labeled at the XbaI end starting with pBLCAT2-C30 containing META (−29 to −439) in the reverse orientation. HindIII digestion of this DNA resulted in the release of a 406-bp labeled META fragment along with labeled 20-bp XbaI-HindIII fragment from the multicloning site and the 4485-bp of the vector DNA. The labeled META DNA along with the vector DNA fragments obtained by these procedures was used without further fractionation.Binding reactions and DNase I digestions were carried out at room temperature as described in the Life Technologies, Inc. DNase I footprinting manual, with minor modifications. Briefly, the assay system contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mM CaCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 mM KCl, 2.5 μg/ml bovine serum, 0.5% glycerol, 100 μg of Jurkat cell nuclear protein, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a reaction volume of 50 μl. Reactions were incubated for 10 min followed by the addition of 1 ng of DNA probe (20,000 cpm). After an additional incubation of 20 min, 50 μl of DNase I buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl, and 1 mM CaCl) was added, and 50 ng of DNase I. Digestion was carried out for 1 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of stop buffer (10 mM MES, pH 7.0, 15 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 250 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 10 μg of proteinase K). Proteinase K digestion was continued for 30 min at 37°C. The reactions were extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), precipitated using ethanol and sodium acetate, dissolved in formamide loading buffer, and subjected to 6% acrylamide, 7 M urea PAGE (0.4 mm thick gel) in 1 × TBE buffer using a Life Technologies, Inc. vertical gel apparatus. Dried gels were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70°C with an intensifying screen.Mobility Shift AssaysSingle-stranded oligonucleotides (sense strands) were end-labeled using [-P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase, the kinase was heat-denatured, and the fragments were annealed to complementary antisense oligonucleotides. Unincorporated label was separated on G-50 Sephadex spin columns. Binding reactions were carried out with 0.5 nM probe (5,000-10,000 cpm) in a final reaction volume of 20 μl at room temperature. Reaction mixtures contained 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 75 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10 μg of Jurkat cell nuclear extracts. Probe was added to the reaction mix after 10 min, or a total of 25 min when cold competitor DNA was included. Binding reactions were then continued for 30 min, analyzed on 4% acrylamide (1.5-mm-thick gels) in 1 × TBE at room temperature. Dried gels were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70°C with an intensifying screen.Transfections and Measurement of Luciferase ActivityPurified plasmid DNA that was >90% closed circular, as judged by gel analysis and ethidium bromide fluorescence quantitation (27.Morgan A.R. Evans D.H. Lee J.S. Pulleyblank D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 571-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was used in the DEAE-dextran transfection protocol(9.Miller C.L. Garner R. Paetkau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3262-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A total of 15 μg of DNA was used in a volume of 2 ml. Following transfection, cells were resuspended, divided, and maintained in RHFM medium for 36-42 h. Cells were induced for 6 h by adding PMA plus A23187 with or without CsA. Cells were pelleted, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in lysis buffer: 1% Triton X-100, 25 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO, 4 mM EGTA, and 1 mM DTT (28.Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activities in whole cell extracts were measured as described in the Promega luciferase assay manual using a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer. The luciferase assay contained 20 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 1 mM Mg(CO), 2.7 mM MgSO, 0.1 mM EDTA, 33 mM DTT, 0.47 mM luciferin, 0.53 mM ATP, and 0.27 mM coenzyme A in a reaction volume of 100 μl.RESULTSDNA Footprint Analysis of the Interaction of Nuclear Factors from Jurkat Cells with the META SequenceThe complete META segment of MMTV, comprising the 411-bp region lying between 29 and 439 bp upstream of the novel env promoter (Fig. 1), has previously been shown to mediate inducible, CsA-suppressible, and T lymphocyte-specific expression of reporter genes(9.Miller C.L. Garner R. Paetkau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3262-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Overall, it responds in parallel with lymphokine enhancers, such as that of IL2, in T cell lines. We therefore carried out DNase I footprinting experiments to look for interactions with nuclear factors from Jurkat cells, a human T cell line that is induced to synthesize IL2 by a combination of PMA and a calcium ionophore. Nuclear extracts from uninduced Jurkat cells, and from cells stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin, were examined. The footprint pattern shown in Fig. 2A revealed two regions of protection with induced extracts, compared to extracts from unstimulated cells. These are referred to as proximal (META(P)) and distal (META(D)). META(P) is located around −116 to −146 relative to the META transcriptional start site. Extracts from induced cells showed partial or faint protection of this region, compared to uninduced cells. In three independent experiments with end-labeled lower strand, partial protection of META(P) was consistently observed. On the other hand, META(D) comprised two strong and discrete footprints with extracts of stimulated cells, one in the −296 to −323 region and the other in the −325 to −349 region.Figure 2DNase I footprinting analysis of META. The lower (A) or the upper (B) strand of META was end-labeled and subjected to DNase I digestion in the presence of nuclear extracts from uninduced Jurkat cells(-), or cells stimulated (+) with PMA plus ionomycin (A) or PMA plus A23187 (B). The positions of segments differentially protected in induced and uninduced extracts are indicated as “D” (distal) or “P” (proximal) on the line representation of the sequence on the left, which also shows the location of the label (∗). Protected regions META(D-) and META(D+) were observed with the uninduced and induced nuclear extracts, respectively, and region P was found to be weakly protected with induced extracts. N, no nuclear extract; G, G/A, and T/C indicate Maxam-Gilbert chemical sequencing reactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further delineate the META(D) footprint, we performed DNase I digestions using the upper strand of META (Fig. 2B). The footprint pattern in the META(D) region showed some differences compared to the lower strand results of Fig. 2A. Specifically, the −296 to −323 region was protected by uninduced nuclear extracts, whereas the −325 to −349 region was protected with induced extracts. We have repeated these experiments three times with each of the lower and upper strands, using either PMA/ionomycin or PMA/A23187 as inducing agents (the two calcium ionophores are similarly effective in inducing IL2 synthesis in Jurkat cells, and showed no difference in footprinting results). The META(D) footprint shown in Fig. 2A was the only case in which both parts of META(D) were protected by nuclear extracts from induced cells only. All of the experiments in which the upper strand was labeled were similar to the result in Fig. 2B. Two out of three experiments with the lower strand labeled also showed this protection pattern, i.e. protection of one element of META(D) in unstimulated cells (META(D-)), and of an adjacent element in stimulated cells (META(D+)). The single anomalous result shown in Fig. 2A, i.e. protection of the complete META(D) region by induced extracts, did not result from either peculiarities of the binding reaction or limited resolution at the top of the gel; the results were reproducible with that extract and were unchanged upon longer electrophoresis. In all experiments, however, META(D) and META(P) always exhibited differential protection, and no protected regions other than these were seen in the 411-bp META sequence.To summarize, the META(D+) element was consistently protected by extracts from induced cells, relative to uninduced extracts. In most cases, META (D-) was protected by extracts from uninduced cells (the exception being the result of Fig. 2A). META(P) was protected weakly by extracts of induced cells. META(D+) protection was the most strongly correlated with conditions of transcriptional induction of META itself (9.Miller C.L. Garner R. Paetkau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3262-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and of lymphokines, and it was therefore selected for further analysis.Binding of Jurkat Nuclear Factors to the META(D) ElementsThe META(D+) and META(D-) elements are delineated in Fig. 1C. Oligonucleotides containing these sequences (Table 1) were used to look for binding factors by gel shift analysis with nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells (Fig. 3). The D(+) probe (lanes 1-4) demonstrated one very strong complex (arrow 1), and one that was barely detectable (arrow 2) with extracts from unstimulated cells. Under conditions of transcriptional activation, a very strong additional band of intermediate mobility (arrow 3) was seen, and a greatly enhanced amount of complex in the region of the slower constitutive band (arrow 2). Formation of these complexes was almost completely abolished by CsA, which blocks activation of META transcription(8.Elliott J.F. Pohajdak B. Talbot D.J. Shaw J. Paetkau V. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1373-1380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Miller C.L. Garner R. Paetkau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3262-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The META(D-) probe (lanes 5-8) showed a strong band with uninduced cell extracts, which was almost completely abolished under conditions of cellular induction, and was partially restored when CsA was present (arrow 4).Figure 3Binding of nuclear factors to the META(D) region. Mobility shift assays were carried out using META(D+) or META(D-) probes at 0.5 nM.

The human papillomavirus type 18 p92 binding sequence confers enhancer activity on a heterologous promoter, suggesting that p92 acts as a transcription factor. We have identified a class of nuclear inhibitory proteins, I-92s, which noncovalently associate with p92 but not with other transcription factors such as AP1, E2F, or NF-κB. Different I-92s occur in G1, G2, and G0, while no I-92 is detectable in S phase. Phase-specific inhibitors, therefore, are responsible for the cell cycle dependence of p92 activity and provide a novel mechanism linking transcription factor regulation with the cell cycle.

HPV18 belongs to the group of human papilloma viruses with high oncogenic potential(2.zur Hausen H. Science. 1992; 254: 1167-1173Crossref Scopus (655) Google Scholar). p92 is a sequence-specific nuclear factor that specifically binds to the 5′-AATTGCTTGCATAA motif and other related motifs in the HPV18 enhancer (1.Royer H.-D.

DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). p92 was originally identified by binding site blotting experiments(1.Royer H.-D. Freyaldenhoven M.P. Napierski I. Spitkovsky D.D. Bauknecht T. Dathan N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and retarded p92s containing DNA-protein complexes were identified by preparative electrophoretic mobility shift experiments and analysis of eluted proteins by binding site blotting (4.Weitz J. Kopun M. Stoehr M. Napierski I. Royer H.-D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5725-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In addition, the 5′-AATTGCTTGCATAA motif is recognized by p92-related factors as was shown by UV cross-linking experiments(3.Grinstein E. Royer H.-D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). p92, however, is the most prominent retarded DNA-protein complex in electrophoretic mobility shift assays(4.Weitz J. Kopun M. Stoehr M. Napierski I. Royer H.-D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5725-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The HPV18 p92 recognition sequence 5′-AATTGCTTGCATAA consists of two partially overlapping octamer-related motifs(1.Royer H.-D. Freyaldenhoven M.P. Napierski I. Spitkovsky D.D. Bauknecht T. Dathan N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3.Grinstein E. Royer H.-D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We have shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) that in vitro translated Oct-1 protein interacts with the 5′-AATTGCTTGCATAA motif. p92, however, is not related to Oct-1, as was shown by immunoblotting using an Oct-1 antiserum(1.Royer H.-D. Freyaldenhoven M.P. Napierski I. Spitkovsky D.D. Bauknecht T. Dathan N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, the intracellular distribution of p92 is regulated by growth factors, because p92 was found in the cytoplasm of serum-starved nontumorigenic HeLa-fibroblast hybrid cells (444 cells) and was translocated to the nucleus upon serum stimulation at the beginning of S phase(1.Royer H.-D.

Royer H.-D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5725-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We have shown by centrifugal elution experiments that during the cell cycle p92 DNA binding activity is restricted to S phase of 444 cells that contain integrated human papillomavirus type 18(4.Weitz J. Kopun M. Stoehr M. Napierski I. Royer H.-D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5725-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In crude nuclear extracts, we have identified an uncharacterized activity, termed I-92, which inhibits DNA binding of p92(4.Weitz J. Kopun M. Stoehr M. Napierski I. Royer H.-D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5725-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In cell cycle populations of 444 cells, p92 DNA binding activity could not be detected in nuclear extracts from G1 phase and from G2 phase cells. It was, however, possible to detect p92 after treatment of these extracts with the detergent deoxycholate(4.Weitz J. Kopun M. Stoehr M. Napierski I. Royer H.-D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5725-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), suggesting that p92 was complexed to an inhibitor in G1 and in G2 phase of the cell cycle. human papilloma virus type 18 sodium deoxycholate electrophoretic mobility shift assay electrophoretic mobility shift inhibition assay fluorescence-activated cell sorting normal human diploid fibroblast polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis electrophoretic mobility shift-DNA activating protein-1. In the present communication we characterized I-92 biochemically and functionally. We have delineated a molecular mechanism underlying p92 cell cycle regulation and identified four nuclear inhibitors that link cell cycle regulation with p92 regulation. In normal diploid human fibroblasts (NHDFs), p92 DNA binding is restricted to S phase. In addition, we have determined that p92 may act as a transcription factor because a p92 binding site from the HPV18 upstream regulatory region conferred enhancer activity on a heterologous promoter. The p92/I-92 system, therefore, may represent a novel mechanism of phase-specific gene regulation. Normal human fibroblasts (PromoCell) and the nontumorigenic HeLa-fibroblast hybrid cell line 444 (5.Stanbridge E.J. Der C.J. Doersen C.J. Nishimi R.Y. Peehl D.M. Weissman B.E. Wilkinson J.E. Science. 1982; 215: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (6.Sealey L. Chalkley R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with some modifications(1.Royer H.-D. Freyaldenhoven M.P. Napierski I. Spitkovsky D.D. Bauknecht T. Dathan N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were scraped from plates, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then lysed with 0.65% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), and nuclei were prepared by low speed centrifugation at 4°C. Nuclear proteins were eluted with 520 mM NaCl and slight agitation followed by dialysis against a buffer containing 50% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. Lovastatin (a generous gift of Merck, Sharp and Dome) was used to prepare G1 phase 444 cells (7.Keyomarsi K. Sandoval L. Band V. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3602-3609PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Pardee A.B. Keyomarsi K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) for the extraction of nuclear proteins and the analysis of I-92 during the cell cycle. Semiconfluent fibroblasts and 444 cells were cultivated for 24 h in the presence of 20 μM lovastatin and then processed for the extraction of nuclear proteins. The efficiencies of G1 phase synchronization were determined by nuclear staining with propidium iodide and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) measurements of the DNA content. FACS analysis showed that 70% of cells had a diploid DNA content (2n), S phase cells were 14%, and 4n cells were 15%. The drug aphidicolin blocks the activity of DNA polymerase α(9.Jackman A.L. Taylor G.A. Gibson W. Kimbell R. Brown M. Calvert A.H. Judson I.R. Hughes L.R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5579-5586PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Matherly L.H. Schuetz J.D. Westin E. Goldman I.D. Anal.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We used this reagent to synchronize 444 in S phase of the cell cycle. In brief, we treated fibroblasts and 444 cells in culture for 24 h with 3 μM aphidicolin followed by a 3-h release in fresh medium. Under those conditions FACS analysis showed that 65% of cells were in S phase, 28% were 4n, and 6% were 2n. We used an aphidicolin release strategy to obtain 444 cells in G2 phase of the cell cycle. We determined empirically that after a 24-h aphidicolin treatment (3 μM) and a 10-h release, 87% of the cells were 4n as was shown by FACS analysis. In addition we controlled this synchronization event by Western blot analysis using anti-cyclin B antibodies, because cyclin B expression is restricted to G2 phase of the cell cycle(12.Pines J. Hunter T. Nature. 1990; 346: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 13.Standart N. Minshull J. Pines J. Hunt T. Dev. Biol. 1987; 124: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14.Minshull J. Golsteyn R. Hill C. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2865-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We found strong expression of cyclin B in G2 phase-synchronized 444 cells, whereas no signal or very little signal was evident in G1 phase and in S phase 444 cells. The latter result is another good control for S phase synchronization because cyclin B is already expressed early in G2 phase. The drug nocodazole blocks the formation of microtubules, which mediate chromosome segregation during mitosis(15.Morgan D.O. Kaplan J.M. Bishop J.M. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1989; 57: 775-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 16.King A.L. Sherwood S.W. Schimke R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9553-9557Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Treatment of 444 cells with nocodazole (10 μg/ml) for 18 h yields floating cells that no longer attach to plastic. These shake-off cells are in mitosis, and they were used as a source for the preparation of “mitotic” nuclear extracts. This preparation contained 86% 4n cells as was measured by FACS analysis. Deprivation of growth factors or cultivation in low serum leads to a reversible exit from the cell cycle into the G0 phase(17.Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar, 18.Rollins B.J. Stiles C.D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 53: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In order to obtain G0 phase 444 cells, we grew these in 0.05% fetal calf serum for 48 h. FACS analysis, however, will not be able to discriminate between G1 phase and G0 phase cells because both have a 2n DNA content. We used the nuclear proliferation marker Ki67 (19.Lopez F. Belloc F. Lacombe F. Dumain P. Reiffers J. Bernard P. Boisseau M.R. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 210: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as a measure to assess G0 synchronization, because Ki67 is expressed in cycling but not in resting G0 cells. 5 × 105 cells were treated with ethanol for 1 h at −20°C. Subsequently, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 40 U/ml of RNase A and 100 μg/ml propidium iodide, incubated for 30 min at 37°C, and analyzed by the fluorescence-activated cell sorter using the Cellquest program (Beckton Dickinson). The p92 recognition site present in RP3 was cloned in pGL-2 enhancer tester construct; likewise, a p92 binding mutant RP3-Δ was cloned in pGL-2 (Promega). As a control for transfection efficiencies pSV-gal (Promega) and pCMV-gal (Promega) were used. 1.8 × 105 444 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate technique and 10 μg of either pRP3-GL-2 or pRP3-/RP3-Δ and in combination with 5 μg of pSV-gal or 5 μg of pCMV-gal as internal control. After 24 h, fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. Cell lysis and processing of lysates for luciferase measurements was according to the recommended procedures by the producer of the luciferase kit (Promega) and a luminometer (Berthold). The internal control for transfection efficiency was measured using a Galactolight kit (Tropix). Crude I-92 was prepared following a published protocol (20.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 21.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) with modifications (3.Grinstein E. Royer H.-D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 4.Weitz J. Kopun M. Stoehr M. Napierski I. Royer H.-D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5725-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) from fibroblasts and 444 cells. In brief, nuclear extracts were treated with the detergent deoxycholate (DOC), passed over heparin-Sepharose after the addition of Nonidet P-40 and the flow-through fraction (crude I-92) was collected. Crude I-92 (200 μg) was size-separated by Sephacryl S300 HR chromatography (500 × 7-mm inner diameter) using electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS)-DNA binding buffer as column buffer (1.Royer H.-D. Freyaldenhoven M.P. Napierski I. Spitkovsky D.D. Bauknecht T. Dathan N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min at 4°C. In each experiment 80 fractions (200 μl) were collected and assayed for I-92 activity (50 μl). In other experiments crude I-92 (5 mg) was fractionated by Mono Q-Sepharose. After loading, the column was washed with 1 column volume (2 ml) of column buffer, 5% glycerol, 20 mM Hepes (pH 8), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Subsequently, bound proteins were eluted with a NaCl step gradient as indicated in the figures. Each eluate consisted of 2 × 0.5-ml fractions, and for the determination of I-92 activity 25 μl were used. All eluates were dialyzed using EMS-DNA binding buffer. I-92 activity in all experiments was monitored by a p92 electrophoretic mobility shift inhibition assay (EMSIA). Crude I-92 (1 mg) from 444 cells was size-separated by SDS-PAGE (10%). After electrophoresis the gel was cut in slices, and proteins were eluted overnight using an elution buffer (750 μl) containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml insulin as carrier. Eluted proteins were precipitated with acetone and resuspended in EMS-DNA binding buffer containing 6 M urea. Denatured proteins were subsequently renatured after an overnight dialysis against 3 M urea followed by dialysis against EMS-DNA binding buffer. The procedure followed published protocols(20.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 21.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 22.Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). I-92 activity was monitored by a p92 EMSIA. EMSA was performed as previously published(1.Royer H.-D. Freyaldenhoven M.P. Napierski I. Spitkovsky D.D. Bauknecht T. Dathan N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For the detection of AP-1 a consensus sequence was used (Santa Cruz), for the detection of E2F a consensus oligonucleotide was used(23.Thalmeier K. Synovzik H. Mertz R. Winnacker E.-L. Lipp M. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and for the detection of NF-κB a consensus oligonucleotide was used(24.Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (BioTez) were radioactively labeled as published(25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For immunoshift analysis an anti-Fos rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Medac) was used at the concentrations indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. As a control an unrelated rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against a human endogenous retrovirus antigen (a gift of R. Kurth, Paul Ehrlich Institute, Langen) was used at the concentrations indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. For the quantitation of I-92 activity we used partially purified p92 as a target and an electrophoretic mobility shift as a read-out system. A nuclear extract of 444 cells was treated with deoxycholate and passed over heparin-Sepharose. p92 was eluted with 500 mM NaCl and dialyzed against EMS-DNA binding buffer, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol. In all electrophoretic mobility shift inhibition assays, 0.4 μg from the same p92 preparation were used. For EMSIA I-92, preparations were incubated with 0.4 μg of partially purified p92 at room temperature (20 min), and end-labeled RP3 double-stranded oligonucleotide (15,000 cpm) and 200 ng of poly(dI-dC)(dI-dC) were added and incubated for 15 min. Subsequently DNA-protein complexes were analyzed on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel using 0.25% TBE (25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) as a running buffer. Dried gels were exposed at −70°C using Kodak X-Omat AR films. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblot analysis were performed according to standard procedures(25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Samples (30 μg) were mixed with an equal volume of twice concentrated Laemmli sample buffer (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide), and the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). The blots were blocked with 10% dried milk (Carnation) in TTBS buffer (25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) for 2 h. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against a peptide of the cyclin B protein was used at 1:200 dilution, and a monoclonal antiserum directed against the Ki67 antigen (Dianova) was used at 1:300 dilution. Detection of immunoreactive bands was by the enhanced chemiluminiscence method (Amersham Corp.). Our previous work suggested that the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor p92 is cell cycle-regulated by an inhibitor termed I-92 (4.Weitz J. Kopun M. Stoehr M. Napierski I. Royer H.-D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5725-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It was the aim of this study to characterize I-92 and p92 biochemically and functionally. As shown previously, p92 DNA binding activity is cell cycle-regulated in 444 cells, which are immortalized, nontumorigenic HeLa-fibroblast hybrid cells harboring integrated human papillomavirus type 18 DNA(1.Royer H.-D. Freyaldenhoven M.P. Napierski I. Spitkovsky D.D. Bauknecht T. Dathan N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). First we wanted to address the question of p92 regulation in a nontransformed normal human cell population. We therefore analyzed p92 activity in NHDFs. NHDFs were synchronized in tissue culture using lovastatin for G1 phase cells, aphidicolin and a 3-h release for S phase cells, aphidicolin and a 7-h release for G2 phase cells, nocodazole for mitotic cells, and serum starvation for G0 phase cells. From each synchronized cell population nuclear extracts were prepared and examined for p92 DNA binding activity by EMSAs. p92 was not detectable in serum-starved G0 phase cells (Fig. 1, lane 1), almost undetectable in lovastatin-treated G1 phase cells, and likewise almost undetectable in G2 phase cells (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 4). In S phase cells, however, large amounts of p92 were present (Fig. 1, lane 3). In addition, p92 was almost undetectable in mitotic cells (Fig. 1, lane 5). We conclude from these results that p92 is a factor that operates in normal human diploid fibroblasts and that p92 activity is restricted to S phase of the cell cycle. These results were also confirmed by centrifugal elution of NHDF cells. 2Marijana Kopun and H.-D. Royer, unpublished results. One goal of this study was to characterize p92 functionally. In order to do so, we wanted to determine whether p92 might act as a transcription factor. We have previously characterized multiple p92 recognition sites in the enhancer of HPV18 (1.Royer H.-D. Freyaldenhoven M.P. Napierski I. Spitkovsky D.D. Bauknecht T. Dathan N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and presented evidence that the 5′-AATTGCTTGCATAA motif, consisting of two partially overlapping octamer-related sequences specifically interacted with p92 and other p92-related proteins, as was shown by UV cross-linking(3.Grinstein E. Royer H.-D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). EMSAs revealed, however, that in S phase the retarded RP3-p92 complex is always the most prominent DNA-protein complex (Fig. 1, lane 3)(4.Weitz J. Kopun M. Stoehr M. Napierski I. Royer H.-D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5725-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The 5′-AATTGCTTGCATAA motif is part of the longer oligonucleotide RP3, which was previously identified as a p92 binding sequence element(1.Royer H.-D. Freyaldenhoven M.P. Napierski I. Spitkovsky D.D. Bauknecht T. Dathan N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 3.Grinstein E. Royer H.-D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In oligonucleotide RP3-Δ the 5′-TTGCTTGCATAA sequence of the 5′-AATTGCTTGCATAA motif was deleted, and we showed that p92 no longer bound to the RP3-Δ mutant (3.Grinstein E. Royer H.-D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown previously that the deleted 5′-TTGCTTGCATAA sequence binds p92 in a sequence-specific manner(3.Grinstein E. Royer H.-D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For functional analysis oligonucleotides RP3 and RP3-Δ were cloned in the enhancer tester luciferase construct pGL-2 and assayed in the nontumorigenic HeLa-fibroblast hybrid cell line 444. RP3 mediated activation of the luciferase reporter gene to a level of 12.9% when compared with the cotransfected pSV-β-gal control, whereas the deletion mutant RP3-Δ did not confer significant luciferase gene activation (Fig. 2). Reporter gene assays were repeated 6 times with two different DNA preparations and were reproducible. The error bars in the control experiments pGL-2 and RP3-/delta are not visible due to low luciferase activities of these constructs. These experiments showed that the p92 recognition site conferred transcriptional activation, and suggests that proteins that specifically bind to this sequence act as transcription factors. We assume that p92 was responsible for transcriptional activation in these experiments because it is the major retarded complex detectable by EMSA in nuclear extracts of 444 cells(4.Weitz J. Kopun M. Stoehr M. Napierski I. Royer H.-D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5725-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It was not part of this work to analyze in detail the sequence requirements for p92 DNA binding. A key question is how gene expression is coordinated with cell cycle progression. In this report we have shown that a p92 binding site conferred activation of the SV40 minimal promoter present in reporter gene vector pGL2. We have established previously that in the HeLa-fibroblast hybrid cell line 444, which contains integrated human papillomavirus type 18, p92 DNA binding was restricted to S phase of the cell cycle, and we have presented evidence that the DNA binding activity of p92 could be regulated by a putative nuclear inhibitor(4.Weitz J.

This assumption was based on our observation that p92 could be released from putative I-92-p92 complexes by treatment with the detergent DOC (4.Weitz J. Kopun M. Stoehr M. Napierski I. Royer H.-D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5725-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that p92 acts as a transcription factor and that p92 might be cell cycle-regulated by I-92, we hypothesized that I-92 could link cell cycle regulation with transcription factor regulation. In order to characterize I-92 we have accomplished a biochemical and functional analysis of I-92 activities. In the following we summarize several features that candidate I-92 proteins must show in order to be considered as I-92. 1) The DNA binding activity of p92 should be inhibited by partially purified I-92. 2) I-92 inhibition of p92 DNA binding should be selective. 3) I-92 inhibition of p92 DNA binding should be cell cycle-regulated. 4) I-92 inhibition of p92 DNA binding should be reversible after treatment with the detergent DOC. p92 binds to octamer-related sequences from the HPV18 enhancer(1.Royer H.-D. Freyaldenhoven M.P. Napierski I. Spitkovsky D.D. Bauknecht T. Dathan N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that “crude” I-92 did not inhibit DNA binding of the Oct-1 transcription factor(3.Grinstein E. Royer H.-D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In order to prepare crude I-92, nuclear extracts of 444 cells were treated with the detergent DOC following a published procedure (4.Weitz J. Kopun M. Stoehr M. Napierski I. Royer H.-D.

In order to further define selectivity of I-92 inhibition we chose to analyze other transcription factors whose DNA binding activities are regulated by specific inhibitors. We examined the transcription factor AP-1, which is regulated by IP-1(27.Auwerx J. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1990; 64: 983-993Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this experiment an AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide was used in EMSA. The identity of Fos-Jun retarded complexes was verified by immunoshift analysis using a polyclonal rabbit anti-Fos antiserum (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). As a control an unrelated polyclonal rabbit antiserum was used directed against the Gag protein of a human endogenous retrovirus HERV-K (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5). The addition of increasing amounts of crude I-92 did not affect AP-1 retarded complex formation, suggesting that AP-1 is not regulated by I-92 (Fig. 3, lanes 7, 8, and 9). The I-92 unit definition was described(3.Grinstein E. Royer H.-D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In addition we found that DNA binding of neither NF-κB, which is regulated by I-κB(25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

https://openalex.org/W2077023550,"We have previously reported that Ras protein is a potent cysteine proteinase inhibitor. In order to examine whether the cysteine proteinase-inhibitory activity of Ras is involved in carcinogenesis, the effects of the following probes were investigated. Cystatin α is a cysteine proteinase-specific inhibitor and has some amino acid sequence homology with Ras. Ras has a CAAX motif (C, cysteine; A, aliphatic amino acid; X, any amino acid) at the carboxyl terminus, which is indispensable for the biological activity. Thus, cystatin α carrying a CAAX motif (cystatin α-CVLS) was examined. A v-Ha-Ras deletion mutant, RasΔ42-49, has undetectable GTP binding activity, yet it retains a similar protease inhibitory activity to that of wild-type v-Ras. These genes were inserted into a eukaryotic inducible expression vector and transfected into NIH3T3 cells. The expression was effectively induced by treatment with a glucocorticoid hormone, dexamethasone. The expression of cystatin α-CVLS or RasΔ42-49 alone induced neither transformation nor morphological changes. However, when their expression was induced in the presence of a tumor-promoting phorbol ester, a remarkable increase in the anchorage-independent growth was observed in cystatin α-CVLS- and RasΔ42-49-transfected clones. These results suggest that cysteine proteinase inhibitors and a tumor promoter synergistically transformed NIH3T3 cells. It is thus possible that the cysteine proteinase-inhibitory activity of Ras might play a key role in the early stage of carcinogenesis.

It is thus possible that the cysteine proteinase-inhibitory activity of Ras might play a key role in the early stage of carcinogenesis. A number of studies have been made on the action mechanism of ras oncogene product (Ras), and multiple proteins have been proposed as the effectors of Ras protein. These are rasGAP, protein kinase C, c-Raf-1, ralGDS, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(1.Trahey M. McCormick F.A. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 2.Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Frutos S. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol.

It has been suggested that Ras does not directly activate the kinase activity of Raf but translocates it from cytosol to membrane (6.Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that Ras is a potent protease inhibitor(7.Hiwasa T. Yokoyama S. Ha J.-M. Noguchi S. Sakiyama S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8.Hiwasa T. Sakiyama S. Noguchi S. Ha J.-M. Miyazawa T. Yokoyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The inhibitory activity of Ras is specific for cysteine proteinases such as cathepsins B and L. Consistently, the amino acid sequence of Ras is partly homologous to those of the cysteine proteinase inhibitor family designated “cystatin superfamily”(7.Hiwasa T. Yokoyama S. Ha J.-M. Noguchi S. Sakiyama S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10.Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). If the cysteine proteinase-inhibitory activity of Ras is involved in the transformation, cystatins might have a similar transforming activity. The present results suggest that inhibition of cysteine proteinases is sufficient for the conversion from a normal cell to an initiated one. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts and the transfected clones were cultured in Dulbecco's modified medium supplemented with 5% calf serum. Ras proteins (1 μg) were electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane filter. The filter was then incubated with [α-32P]GTP (5 μCi/ml) in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.3% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature according to the method of Lapetina and Reep(11.Lapetina E.G. Reep B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2261-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The filter was washed extensively with buffer A and exposed on x-ray film. -A cDNA fragment (1627 base pairs) of human c-raf-1 (12.Bonner T.I. Kerby S.B. Sutrave P. Gunnell M.A. Mark G. Rapp U.R.

Binding between Ras proteins and GST-c-Raf was investigated as described previously(13.Pumiglia K. Chow Y.-H. Fabian J. Morrison D. Decker S. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Purified GST or GST-c-Raf protein (1 μg) was first incubated at 4°C for 30 min with glutathione-Sepharose in binding buffer (100 mM KCl, 6.33 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1.0 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml, 25 μM ZnCl2), and the unbound proteins were removed by washing with binding buffer. Guanine nucleotides prebound to Ras were exchanged by incubation of Ras at 30°C for 15 min in loading buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 75 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml, and 1 mM GDP or GMP-PNP. GST or GST-c-Raf immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was then incubated with Ras (1 μg) at 4°C for 30 min in binding buffer and washed 4 times with wash buffer (100 mM KCl, 6.33 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.25% Triton X-100). The bound materials were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-Ras monoclonal antibody, NCC-RAS-001(14.Hiwasa T. Sawada T. Tanaka K. Chiba T. Tanaka T. Kominami E. Katunuma N. Sakiyama S. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 579-585PubMed Google Scholar). Rat cystatin α cDNA was provided by Drs. Nobuhiko Katunuma (Tokushima Bunri University) and Yoshimasa Ike (Mitsui Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.)(15.Katunuma N. Yamato M. Kominami E. Ike Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A gene for cystatin α bearing a CAAX motif (Tyr-Cys-Val-Leu-Ser) at the carboxyl terminus was also constructed as described previously (16.Hiwasa T. Ma J. Ike Y. Katunuma N. Sakiyama S. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1995; 13: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This cystatin α variant was designated “cystatin α-CVLS” in the following part. v-Ha-ras gene (v-Ras(WT)) was provided by Dr. Berthe M. Willumsen (University Institute of Microbiology, Copenhagen). Two deletion mutants were constructed as described(17.Sawada T. Sakiyama S. Hiwasa T. Proteases Involved in Cancer. Monduzzi Editore, Bologna, Italy1995: 177-181Google Scholar). RasΔ43-45 and RasΔ42-49 have deletions in amino acids 43-45 and 42-49, respectively. Cystatin α, cystatin α-CVLS, v-Ras(WT), RasΔ43-45, and RasΔ42-49 DNAs were inserted into a SmaI site of an inducible eukaryotic expression vector, pMSG (Pharmacia). Using this vector, the inserted genes are effectively induced by dexamethasone (Dex). Cystatin α or cystatin α-CVLS DNA (10 μg) was co-transfected with neo (1 μg) into NIH3T3 cells (5 × 105 cells) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected clones were selected in the presence of G418 (400 μg/ml). NV, NY, NS, NR, NII, and NIII represent the transfectants of vector, cystatin α, cystatin α-CVLS, v-ras(WT), rasD42-29, and rasΔ43-45 DNAs, respectively. Cell growth in soft agar medium was examined as described previously(18.Hiwasa T. Tanigawara C. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 953-959PubMed Google Scholar). Five thousand cells were plated in soft agar medium, which contained 0.4% SeaPlaque-agarose, 10% calf serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Dex (1 μM) or the solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1%). After culture at 37°C for 3 weeks, colonies whose diameters were larger than 0.1 mm were scored. The colony-forming efficiency was calculated by dividing the colony number by the cell number plated. The cysteine proteinase-inhibitory activity of cystatin α was more potent than that of Ras(7.Hiwasa T. Yokoyama S. Ha J.-M. Noguchi S. Sakiyama S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19.Takeda A. Kobayashi S. Samejima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, cystatin α possesses neither guanine nucleotide binding activity nor a CAAX motif. A CAAX motif at the carboxyl-terminal end of Ras is necessary not only for post-translational farnesylation but also for the biological activity(20.Hancock J.F. Magee A.L. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). Thus the biological activity of cystatin α carrying the CAAX motif (cystatin α-CVLS) was also investigated. Other probes used were two deletion mutants of v-Ha-Ras, RasΔ43-45 and RasΔ42-49. The most conserved amino acid sequence among the cystatin superfamily is Gln-Val-Val(10.Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 30: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), which is also found in Ras at amino acid positions between 43 and 45(7.Hiwasa T. Yokoyama S. Ha J.-M. Noguchi S. Sakiyama S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These Ras proteins were bacterially expressed and purified. In spite of the deletion of the conserved amino acid sequence, RasΔ43-45 and RasΔ42-49 showed similar protease-inhibitory activities as that of v-Ras(WT)(17.Sawada T. Sakiyama S. Hiwasa T. Proteases Involved in Cancer. Monduzzi Editore, Bologna, Italy1995: 177-181Google Scholar). For example, the Ki values of v-Ras(WT), RasΔ42-49, and RasΔ43-45 were 48, 102, and 40 nM, respectively, toward bovine cathepsin B and 14, 11, and 8 nM, respectively, toward papain. These results are consistent with the previous report that point mutants in the Gln-Val-Val region did not significantly affected the protease-inhibitory activity of cystatin A (21.Nikawa T. Towatari T. Ike Y. Katunuma N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the Gln-Val-Val sequence might be important but not essential for the interaction with cysteine proteinases. Guanine nucleotide binding activities of these two deletion mutants were also compared with that of v-Ras(WT). Fig. 1 shows the results of GTP binding examined by the filter overlay assay using [α-32P]GTP(11.Lapetina E.G. Reep B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2261-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). v-Ras(WT) showed a potent GTP binding activity while RasΔ42-49 and RasΔ43-45 showed no detectable GTP binding activity. The GTP binding activity was also examined by rapid filtration according to the method of Gibbs et al.(22.Gibbs J.B. Schaber M.D. Allard W.J. Sigal I.S. Scolnick E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5026-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and the results showed both RasΔ42-49 and RasΔ43-45 had less than 1% guanine nucleotide binding activity of that of v-Ras(WT)(17.Sawada T. Sakiyama S. Hiwasa T. Proteases Involved in Cancer. Monduzzi Editore, Bologna, Italy1995: 177-181Google Scholar). We have also investigated the in vitro association of Ras and c-Raf-1. c-Ha-Ras bound to GST-c-Raf only in the presence of GMP-PNP, a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue (Fig. 2). No significant binding was observed toward GST. Under the same conditions, v-Ras(WT) bound to GST-c-Raf irrespective of the GDP- or GMP-PNP-bound form. Guanine nucleotides sometimes do not affect the association between Ras and c-Raf under certain experimental conditions as reported previously(23.Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 24.Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S. Campbell-Burk S. Bell R.M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). RasΔ42-49 showed similar results as those of v-Ras(WT), suggesting that the region between amino acid positions 42 and 49 is not necessarily required for Raf binding. However, RasΔ43-45 failed to bind to GST-c-Raf probably because the deletion caused some additional alteration in the three-dimensional conformation of Ras. DNAs for cystatin α, cystatin α-CVLS, v-Ras(WT), RasΔ42-49, and RasΔ43-45 were inserted into a downstream region of mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat of a eukaryotic expression vector, pMSG, and transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the transfected genes were effectively induced after treatment with Dex(9.Hiwasa T. Proteases Involved in Cancer. Monduzzi Editore, Bologna, Italy1995: 153-160Google Scholar, 16.Hiwasa T. Ma J. Ike Y. Katunuma N. Sakiyama S. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1995; 13: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17.Sawada T. Sakiyama S. Hiwasa T. Proteases Involved in Cancer. Monduzzi Editore, Bologna, Italy1995: 177-181Google Scholar). Induction of cystatin α, cystatin α-CVLS, RasΔ42-49, and RasΔ43-45 did not cause any significant morphological changes whereas induction of v-Ras(WT) resulted in drastic morphological changes as well as the appearance of dense transformed foci (not shown). Because anchorage-independent growth is one of the specific phenotypes observed in malignant cells(18.Hiwasa T. Tanigawara C. Sakiyama S. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 953-959PubMed Google Scholar), growth of transfected clones in soft agar medium was investigated. Vector-transfected clones, NV1, NV2, and NV3, as well as the parent NIH3T3 cells did not grow in soft agar medium while v-ras(WT)-transfected clones, NR24 and NR37, showed high colony-forming efficiencies in the presence of Dex (Fig. 3). These clones grew in soft agar medium even in the absence of Dex probably due to the leaked expression of Ras in the absence of Dex(9.Hiwasa T. Proteases Involved in Cancer. Monduzzi Editore, Bologna, Italy1995: 153-160Google Scholar, 16.Hiwasa T. Ma J. Ike Y. Katunuma N. Sakiyama S. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1995; 13: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). On the other hand, induction of cystatin α, cystatin α-CVLS, RasΔ42-49, and RasΔ43-45 by Dex did not result in any discernible change in the colony-forming ability. This implies that induction of cystatin α, cystatin α-CVLS, RasΔ42-49, or RasΔ43-45 alone is insufficient to induce anchorage-independent transformation. These proteins might play a role at a certain stage in multistage carcinogenesis. Two-stage carcinogenesis, which consists of initiation and promotion, was first proposed by Berenblum(25.Berenblum I. Cancer Res. 1941; 1: 44-48Google Scholar). Initiated cells produced by irradiation or treatment with chemical carcinogens are easily transformed in the presence of tumor promoter phorbol ester, TPA, and the transformation can be evaluated by focus-forming assay (26.Herschman H.R. Brankow D.W. Science. 1986; 234: 1385-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27.Mordan L.J. Martner J.E. Bertram J.S. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4062-4067PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the chemical carcinogens that induce initiation have been shown to induce specific mutations in ras protooncogenes, and thus the involvement of Ras in the early stage of carcinogenesis was suggested(28.Bizub D. Wood A.W. Skalka A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6048-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 29.Balmain A. Ramsden M. Bowden G.T. Smith J. Nature. 1984; 307: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 30.Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar). Consequently, cystatin α might have a role at the stage of initiation and cooperate with a tumor promoter to induce full transformation. Thus, the anchorage-independent growth in the presence of TPA was also investigated (Fig. 3). The culture of cystatin α-CVLS- and RasΔ42-49-transfected clones in the presence of both Dex and TPA resulted in a remarkable increase in colony-forming efficiency, which was significantly higher than that in the absence of either TPA or Dex (p < 0.01). The presence of TPA alone was not sufficient to induce the anchorage-independent transformation in these transfectants. Vector-transfected control clones and NIH3T3 cells showed no significant increase in colony numbers. Induction of cystatin α showed the intermediate results and the colony-forming efficiencies of NY clones in the presence of Dex and TPA were between 10 and 30% (0.01 < p < 0.1) versus that in the absence of TPA. This suggests that the expression of cystatin α partly induces the changes corresponding to initiation. The transformed colonies formed by NY, NS, and NII clones were similar to those formed by NR clones. However, the sizes of the former were smaller than those of the latter (Fig. 4), i.e. the diameters of most colonies of NY, NS, and NII clones were between 0.05 and 0.2 mm while those of NR clones were larger than 0.2 mm. The colony-forming efficiency of NR clones could be underestimated because some colonies were overlapped. The results obtained in the present study are summarized in Table 1. Although cystatin α-CVLS alone cannot induce full transformation, it induced anchorage-independent transformation in the presence of a tumor promoter. RasΔ42-49 also induced anchorage-independent growth at a high efficiency in the presence of TPA in spite of the drastic decrease in the GTP binding activity. This mutant retains the cysteine proteinase-inhibitory activity, which is similar to that of v-Ras(WT). Consequently, suppression of cysteine proteinases may be sufficient for the conversion of a normal cell into an initiated one. The specific role of cysteine protease inhibitors at the stage of initiation is consistent with the possible involvement of ras oncogenes in the stage of initiation(28.Bizub D. Wood A.W. Skalka A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6048-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 29.Balmain A. Ramsden M. Bowden G.T. Smith J. Nature. 1984; 307: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 30.Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Cystatin α-CVLS also induced initiation without any GTP binding activity. The expression of RasΔ43-45 resulted in a slight increase in the colony formation even in the presence of TPA. Since this mutant cannot bind to c-Raf-1, association with Raf protein might be necessary for the transformation. Cystatin α-CVLS induced similar transformation without binding to c-Raf-1, possibly because the protease-inhibitory activity of cystatin α is higher than that of v-Ras(WT)(7.Hiwasa T. Yokoyama S. Ha J.-M. Noguchi S. Sakiyama S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19.Takeda A. Kobayashi S. Samejima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Even if the suppression of cysteine proteinases induces initiation, the present results cannot identify the target protease of Ras and cystatin α. Higher colony-forming efficiencies of NS clones as compared with those of NY clones suggest that the target protease is localized at a membrane fraction. In order to identify the substrates of the target protease, we have investigated the intracellular contents of Ras-binding proteins in the transfected cells before or after treatment with Dex. They were c-Raf-1, A-Raf, MEK, MEK2, protein kinase C, rasGAP, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85. However, none of them increased reproducibly after induction of Ras or cystatin α (data not shown). It is thus unlikely that Ras and cystatin α protect these proteins from degradation. Further study is necessary to determine the target protease and its substrates, which are involved in the induction of initiation. We are grateful to Drs. Berthe M. Willumsen (University Institute of Microbiology, Copenhagen), Nobuhiko Katunuma (Tokushima Bunri University), and Yoshimasa Ike (Mitsui Pharmaceutical Inc.) for providing plasmids. Human c-raf-1 gene was obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank."
