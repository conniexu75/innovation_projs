https://openalex.org/W2166820820,"The Cuffdiff 2 algorithm improves analysis of RNA-Seq data by accounting for sample-to-sample biological variability and the complexity of transcript isoforms. Differential analysis of gene and transcript expression using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is complicated by several sources of measurement variability and poses numerous statistical challenges. We present Cuffdiff 2, an algorithm that estimates expression at transcript-level resolution and controls for variability evident across replicate libraries. Cuffdiff 2 robustly identifies differentially expressed transcripts and genes and reveals differential splicing and promoter-preference changes. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach through differential analysis of lung fibroblasts in response to loss of the developmental transcription factor HOXA1, which we show is required for lung fibroblast and HeLa cell cycle progression. Loss of HOXA1 results in significant expression level changes in thousands of individual transcripts, along with isoform switching events in key regulators of the cell cycle. Cuffdiff 2 performs robust differential analysis in RNA-seq experiments at transcript resolution, revealing a layer of regulation not readily observable with other high-throughput technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2093494581,"During normal ageing a low rate of division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes, rather than progenitor cells, is responsible for cardiomyocyte genesis; this process is increased fourfold during myocardial infarction. There is controversy in the cardiovascular field regarding the extent of existing cardiomyocyte turnover versus progenitor cell contributions during mammalian cardiac homeostasis throughout adult life. This study takes a novel approach to settling the debate by using a combination of prospective labelling with the nitrogen-15 isotope and genetic pulse–chase to measure DNA synthesis in the adult mammalian heart. The authors conclude that during normal ageing, preexisting cardiomyocytes are the dominant source of cardiomyocyte replacement in normal mammalian myocardial homeostasis, a process that is increased fivefold during recovery from myocardial infarction. Although recent studies have revealed that heart cells are generated in adult mammals, the frequency of generation and the source of new heart cells are not yet known. Some studies suggest a high rate of stem cell activity with differentiation of progenitors to cardiomyocytes1. Other studies suggest that new cardiomyocytes are born at a very low rate2,3,4, and that they may be derived from the division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes. Here we show, by combining two different pulse–chase approaches—genetic fate-mapping with stable isotope labelling, and multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry—that the genesis of cardiomyocytes occurs at a low rate by the division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes during normal ageing, a process that increases adjacent to areas of myocardial injury. We found that cell cycle activity during normal ageing and after injury led to polyploidy and multinucleation, but also to new diploid, mononucleate cardiomyocytes. These data reveal pre-existing cardiomyocytes as the dominant source of cardiomyocyte replacement in normal mammalian myocardial homeostasis as well as after myocardial injury."

https://openalex.org/W2151372451,"Whereas large-scale efforts have rapidly advanced the understanding and practical impact of human genomic variation, the practical impact of variation is largely unexplored in the human microbiome. We therefore developed a framework for metagenomic variation analysis and applied it to 252 faecal metagenomes of 207 individuals from Europe and North America. Using 7.4 billion reads aligned to 101 reference species, we detected 10.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 107,991 short insertions/deletions, and 1,051 structural variants. The average ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphism rates of 0.11 was more variable between gut microbial species than across human hosts. Subjects sampled at varying time intervals exhibited individuality and temporal stability of SNP variation patterns, despite considerable composition changes of their gut microbiota. This indicates that individual-specific strains are not easily replaced and that an individual might have a unique metagenomic genotype, which may be exploitable for personalized diet or drug intake. A framework for metagenomic variation analysis to explore variation in the human microbiome is developed; the study describes SNPs, short indels and structural variants in 252 faecal metagenomes of 207 individuals from Europe and North America. A collaboration between members of the European MetaHIT and American NIH Human Microbiome projects has led to the development of a framework for metagenomic variation analysis, which is used to analyse single nucleotide polymorphisms, short indels and structural variants in 252 faecal metagenomes of 207 individuals from Europe and North America. Variation patterns suggest that individuals might have unique metagenomic genotypes that could provide data relevant to personalized dietary or drug choices."
https://openalex.org/W2005173952,"Efficient and tunable absorption is essential for a variety of applications, such as designing controlled-emissivity surfaces for thermophotovoltaic devices, tailoring an infrared spectrum for controlled thermal dissipation and producing detector elements for imaging. Metamaterials based on metallic elements are particularly efficient as absorbing media, because both the electrical and the magnetic properties of a metamaterial can be tuned by structured design. So far, metamaterial absorbers in the infrared or visible range have been fabricated using lithographically patterned metallic structures, making them inherently difficult to produce over large areas and hence reducing their applicability. Here we demonstrate a simple method to create a metamaterial absorber by randomly adsorbing chemically synthesized silver nanocubes onto a nanoscale-thick polymer spacer layer on a gold film, making no effort to control the spatial arrangement of the cubes on the film. We show that the film-coupled nanocubes provide a reflectance spectrum that can be tailored by varying the geometry (the size of the cubes and/or the thickness of the spacer). Each nanocube is the optical analogue of a grounded patch antenna, with a nearly identical local field structure that is modified by the plasmonic response of the metal's dielectric function, and with an anomalously large absorption efficiency that can be partly attributed to an interferometric effect. The absorptivity of large surface areas can be controlled using this method, at scales out of reach of lithographic approaches (such as electron-beam lithography) that are otherwise required to manipulate matter on the nanoscale."

https://openalex.org/W2080119168,"Cellulose, the most abundant biological macromolecule, is an extracellular, linear polymer of glucose molecules. It represents an essential component of plant cell walls but is also found in algae and bacteria. In bacteria, cellulose production frequently correlates with the formation of biofilms, a sessile, multicellular growth form. Cellulose synthesis and transport across the inner bacterial membrane is mediated by a complex of the membrane-integrated catalytic BcsA subunit and the membrane-anchored, periplasmic BcsB protein. Here we present the crystal structure of a complex of BcsA and BcsB from Rhodobacter sphaeroides containing a translocating polysaccharide. The structure of the BcsA-BcsB translocation intermediate reveals the architecture of the cellulose synthase, demonstrates how BcsA forms a cellulose-conducting channel, and suggests a model for the coupling of cellulose synthesis and translocation in which the nascent polysaccharide is extended by one glucose molecule at a time."

https://openalex.org/W1993627126,"TET2 is shown to associate with OGT, which catalyses O-GlcNAcylation, and the two enzymes are found together at transcription start sites; TET2 facilitates the activity of OGT in O-GlcNAcylation of histone 2B, and epigenetic modifications to both DNA and histones by TET2 and OGT may be important in gene transcription regulation. Enzymes of the TET family catalyse the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine, the 'fifth base' in DNA, into derivatives such as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and can influence gene expression. Here, Xiaochun Yu and colleagues show that TET2 associates with O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), an enzyme that catalyses O-GlcNAcylation, and that the two proteins are found concurrently at transcriptional start sites. TET2 facilitates the activity of OGT in O-GlcNAcylation of histone H2B, a histone mark associated with active genes. Thus as well as influencing histone modifications, TET2 can affect DNA modifications of potential importance in transcription regulation Ten eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, including TET1, TET2 and TET3, convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine1 and regulate gene transcription2,3,4,5. However, the molecular mechanism by which TET family enzymes regulate gene transcription remains elusive5,6. Using protein affinity purification, here we search for functional partners of TET proteins, and find that TET2 and TET3 associate with O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT), an enzyme that by itself catalyses the addition of O-GlcNAc onto serine and threonine residues (O-GlcNAcylation) in vivo7,8. TET2 directly interacts with OGT, which is important for the chromatin association of OGT in vivo. Although this specific interaction does not regulate the enzymatic activity of TET2, it facilitates OGT-dependent histone O-GlcNAcylation. Moreover, OGT associates with TET2 at transcription start sites. Downregulation of TET2 reduces the amount of histone 2B Ser 112 GlcNAc marks in vivo, which are associated with gene transcription regulation. Taken together, these results reveal a TET2-dependent O-GlcNAcylation of chromatin. The double epigenetic modifications on both DNA and histones by TET2 and OGT coordinate together for the regulation of gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2035369931,"Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) is the prototypical member of a family of G-protein-coupled receptors that mediate cellular responses to thrombin and related proteases. Thrombin irreversibly activates PAR1 by cleaving the amino-terminal exodomain of the receptor, which exposes a tethered peptide ligand that binds the heptahelical bundle of the receptor to affect G-protein activation. Here we report the 2.2-Å-resolution crystal structure of human PAR1 bound to vorapaxar, a PAR1 antagonist. The structure reveals an unusual mode of drug binding that explains how a small molecule binds virtually irreversibly to inhibit receptor activation by the tethered ligand of PAR1. In contrast to deep, solvent-exposed binding pockets observed in other peptide-activated G-protein-coupled receptors, the vorapaxar-binding pocket is superficial but has little surface exposed to the aqueous solvent. Protease-activated receptors are important targets for drug development. The structure reported here will aid the development of improved PAR1 antagonists and the discovery of antagonists to other members of this receptor family. The X-ray crystal structure of the human G-protein-coupled receptor protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) bound to the antagonist vorapaxar is solved, revealing an unusual method of drug binding that should facilitate the development of improved PAR1-selective antagonists. The X-ray crystal structure of the human protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) bound to vorapaxar, a PAR1 antagonist, has been determined at 2.2 Å resolution. PAR1, also known as the thrombin receptor, is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates cellular responses to the coagulation protease thrombin and related proteases. Vorapaxar was recently shown to prevent myocardial infarction in at-risk patients, and knowledge of the PAR structure will be relevant to the design of PAR1 antagonists with better drug properties."
https://openalex.org/W2118669458,"Anaemia is a chief determinant of global ill health, contributing to cognitive impairment, growth retardation and impaired physical capacity. To understand further the genetic factors influencing red blood cells, we carried out a genome-wide association study of haemoglobin concentration and related parameters in up to 135,367 individuals. Here we identify 75 independent genetic loci associated with one or more red blood cell phenotypes at P < 10−8, which together explain 4–9% of the phenotypic variance per trait. Using expression quantitative trait loci and bioinformatic strategies, we identify 121 candidate genes enriched in functions relevant to red blood cell biology. The candidate genes are expressed preferentially in red blood cell precursors, and 43 have haematopoietic phenotypes in Mus musculus or Drosophila melanogaster. Through open-chromatin and coding-variant analyses we identify potential causal genetic variants at 41 loci. Our findings provide extensive new insights into genetic mechanisms and biological pathways controlling red blood cell formation and function. A series of genetic studies have led to the discovery of novel independent loci and candidate genes associated with red blood cell phenotype; for a proportion of these genes potential single-nucleotide genetic variants are also identified, providing new insights into genetic pathways controlling red blood cell formation, function and pathology. This genome-wide association study of more than 135,000 individuals identifies 75 independent genetic loci influencing red blood cell phenotypes, enriched for genes involved in cell cycle control, transcriptional regulation, growth factor and cytokine signalling, haemoglobin synthesis, iron handling and cytoskeletal function, as well as a number of genes of uncertain or unknown function. Further analyses identified 121 candidate genes related to red blood cell biology, one-third of which have haematopoietic phenotypes in mouse and Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2022538678,"Touch sensation is essential for behaviours ranging from environmental exploration to social interaction; however, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In Drosophila larvae, two types of sensory neurons, class III and class IV dendritic arborization neurons, tile the body wall. The mechanotransduction channel PIEZO in class IV neurons is essential for sensing noxious mechanical stimuli but is not involved in gentle touch. On the basis of electrophysiological-recording, calcium-imaging and behavioural studies, here we report that class III dendritic arborization neurons are touch sensitive and contribute to gentle-touch sensation. We further identify NOMPC (No mechanoreceptor potential C), a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels, as a mechanotransduction channel for gentle touch. NOMPC is highly expressed in class III neurons and is required for their mechanotransduction. Moreover, ectopic NOMPC expression confers touch sensitivity to the normally touch-insensitive class IV neurons. In addition to the critical role of NOMPC in eliciting gentle-touch-mediated behavioural responses, expression of this protein in the Drosophila S2 cell line also gives rise to mechanosensitive channels in which ion selectivity can be altered by NOMPC mutation, indicating that NOMPC is a pore-forming subunit of a mechanotransduction channel. Our study establishes NOMPC as a bona fide mechanotransduction channel that satisfies all four criteria proposed for a channel to qualify as a transducer of mechanical stimuli and mediates gentle-touch sensation. Our study also suggests that different mechanosensitive channels may be used to sense gentle touch versus noxious mechanical stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2060756235,"Much recent discussion about the origin of Parkinsonian symptoms has centered around the idea that they arise with the increase of beta frequency waves in the EEG. This activity may be closely related to an oscillation between subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus. Since STN is the target of deep brain stimulation, it had been assumed that its action is on the nucleus itself. By means of simultaneous recordings of the firing activities from populations of neurons and the local field potentials in the motor cortex of freely moving Parkinsonian rats, this study casts doubt on this assumption. Instead, we found evidence that the corrective action is upon the cortex, where stochastic antidromic spikes originating from the STN directly modify the firing probability of the corticofugal projection neurons, destroy the dominance of beta rhythm, and thus restore motor control to the subjects, be they patients or rodents.

However, the exact mechanism of action of STN-DBS is still not settled (Chang et al., 2008Chang J.Y. Shi L.H. Luo F. Zhang W.M. Woodward D.J.

Functional inactivation, like depolarizing block and depletion of transmitters, could produce a lesion-like effect in the STN (Beurrier et al., 2001Beurrier C. Bioulac B. Audin J. Hammond C.

Later studies suggested that DBS may exert an excitatory effect on neural elements and interferes with the abnormal oscillatory and synchronized activities that are commonly found in the basal ganglia in Parkinsonism (Brown and Eusebio, 2008Brown P.

In principle, DBS can directly activate a wide range of neuronal elements in STN and the surrounding area, including STN neuronal soma, axons of passage, and also the terminals of descending fibers from the cortex to STN (Deniau et al., 2010Deniau J.M.

By activating both afferent and efferent axons, STN-DBS can potentially generate widespread and heterogeneous effects at local and distal sites (Hammond et al., 2008Hammond C. Ammari R. Bioulac B.

In fact, there are a number of studies in both human and animals suggesting that STN stimulation can evoke or modulate cortical activities, which may be beneficial to PD symptoms (Dejean et al., 2009Dejean C.

Thus, early experiments in patients undergoing implantation of STN electrodes demonstrated cortical evoked potentials that resembled antidromic activation from the electrodes (Ashby et al., 2001Ashby P. Paradiso G. Saint-Cyr J.A. Chen R. Lang A.E. Lozano A.M. Potentials recorded at the scalp by stimulation near the human subthalamic nucleus.Clin.

Later demonstration of resonant antidromic cortical circuit activation as a consequence of STN-DBS in anaesthetized rats (Li et al., 2007Li S. Arbuthnott G.W. Jutras M.J. Goldberg J.A. Jaeger D.

Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 3525-3537Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was followed by demonstration that high frequency subthalamic stimulation in awake rats could release them from the akinesia that followed application of dopamine antagonists (Dejean et al., 2009Dejean C.

Cortex. 2009; 19: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These studies along with others in different situations demonstrated that the subthalamic stimulation also disrupted the beta rhythms in the cortex in akinetic animals (Fraix et al., 2008Fraix V. Pollak P. Vercueil L. Benabid A.L. Mauguière F. Effects of subthalamic nucleus stimulation on motor cortex excitability in Parkinson’s disease.Clin.

Neurophysiol. 2009; 102: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Along the same line of reasoning, recent optogenetic experiments suggested that modifying the activity of STN neurons was less effective than direct cortical stimulation in reversing the movement deficits following 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions in mice (Gradinaru et al., 2009Gradinaru V. Mogri M. Thompson K.R. Henderson J.M. Deisseroth K. Optical deconstruction of parkinsonian neural circuitry.Science. 2009; 324: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Despite these previous studies that suggest the importance of antidromically activated responses in the cortex in mediating the beneficial effect of STN-DBS, elucidating the therapeutic mechanism of DBS can only rely on direct recordings of the neural activities during behaviorally effective DBS in freely moving animals. In this study, we addressed this question by making recordings of both single-unit activities and local field potentials in the motor cortex (MI) of freely moving hemi-Parkinsonian animals before, during, and after STN-DBS. The results not only better characterize the abnormal activity in single motor cortical neurons in Parkinsonism, but also reveal a mechanism by which STN-DBS directly interferes with the pathological cortical oscillations characteristic of PD. We generated the conventional hemi-Parkinsonian model by unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) of the adult rat brain. Successful lesion of the nigrostriatal pathway was confirmed by the apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation test. Then, a stimulating electrode was targeted at the ipsilateral STN stereotaxically. In some hemi-Parkinsonian rats, two 16 channel recording arrays were implanted bilaterally into layer V of the MI (Figure 1A). In this group of animals, two stimulating electrodes were implanted in the STN bilaterally to facilitate the identification of layer V MI neurons in both hemispheres (see Experimental Procedures). After all in vivo experiments, correct placements of the stimulating and recording electrodes were confirmed histologically (Figures S1A and S1B available online). The dopamine depletion level induced by the 6-OHDA lesion was further evaluated by the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunostaining of the coronal slices at substantia nigra and striatum (Figures S1C and S1D). In the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the nigral dopaminergic neuron loss reached 89.5% ± 3.5% (mean ± SEM, 26 rats). In the striatum, the loss of TH immunoreactivity was 56.8% ± 7.5% (26 rats). High frequency stimulation (HFS), which consisted of 125 Hz, 60 μs square pulses at an optimal current (see Experimental Procedures), improved the mobility of the hemi-Parkinsonian animals in the open arena (Figure 1B). This effect was confirmed by assessing several parameters in the open field tests, including the time and number of episodes spent in mobility and freezing, the average mobile speed, as well as the time spent in fine movement. For example, as shown in Figure 1C, while the intact animals (n = 17) spent 48.3% ± 1.7% of time mobile and 10.3% ± 1.6% of time freezing, the hemi-Parkinsonian rats (n = 26) spent significantly less amount of time moving (16.8% ± 2.2%, p < 0.001), but more time freezing (46.7% ± 2.1%, p < 0.001). When high frequency (125 Hz) STN-DBS was turned on, the severity of akinesia was largely, though not completely, reversed. Thus, during DBS, the lesioned animals (n = 26) spent 40.9% ± 2.0% of time mobile (p < 0.001 compared with DBS off; p < 0.05 compared with intact) and 17.8% ± 1.4% freezing (p < 0.001 compared with DBS off; p < 0.05 compared with intact). These beneficial effects disappeared immediately when STN-DBS was turned off. Bradykinesia symptoms, as reflected by decreased fine movement and reduced mobile speed, were also evident in the lesioned animals and were similarly alleviated during the delivery of STN-DBS (Figure 1D). Furthermore, in the classical apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation test, STN-DBS resulted in a modest but statistically significant reduction of the rotation speed, which was measured as the number of turns per min (pre-DBS: 19.08 ± 0.61/min; DBS: 16.62 ± 0.62/min; p < 0.01, post-DBS: 18.12 ± 0.73/min; n = 26, Figure 1E). We also characterized the dependence of the therapeutic effect of the STN-DBS paradigm on the stimulation frequency and pulse width. As summarized in Figure 1F, at constant stimulus width of 60 μs, low frequency (0.2–10 Hz) STN-DBS failed to alleviate the motor deficit of the hemi-Parkinsonian animals. However, when the stimulus frequency was 50 Hz and up to 200 Hz, significant improvement was seen in the percentage of time spent in motion. Among the four effective stimulation frequencies tested, namely 50, 125, 200, and 250 Hz, the optimal frequency was 125 Hz, which is in line with those used in clinical and experimental studies. The efficacy of the DBS appeared to be less dependent on pulse width. As shown in Figure 1G, at a constant stimulation frequency of 125 Hz, significant therapeutic effects could be achieved at pulse width ranging from 20 to 80 μs. The falling off of efficacy at 100 μs suggested that the likely target of the stimulation is fibers rather than cells. We recorded extracellular neuronal activities from the MI layer V neurons in both intact and 6-OHDA lesioned rats via multichannel recording arrays when the animals were awake and freely moving. Neuronal activities recorded by each channel were sorted into single units based on the electrophysiological characteristics of spike waveforms in the principal component space (Figure S2A). Two major classes of neuronal unit could be identified. One type of neuron exhibited a relatively long spike width (∼0.5–0.8 ms) and low spontaneous firing rate (<10 Hz), which were presumed to be pyramidal, projection neurons (PNs). Compared with the PNs, presumed interneurons (INs) held shorter spike width (∼0.2–0.5 ms), but higher spontaneous firing rate (∼8–45 Hz). Based on the correlation of the firing rate and spike width (Figure S2B), these two classes of neurons could be distinguished unambiguously. The STN is one of the innervation targets of the long-range corticofugal axons (Kita and Kita, 2012Kita T. Kita H. The subthalamic nucleus is one of multiple innervation sites for long-range corticofugal axons: a single-axon tracing study in the rat.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 5990-5999Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2A, we found evidence of direct activation of corticofugal projection neurons (CxFn) in layer V of MI by identifying stimulation-evoked antidromic spikes in these neurons during STN-DBS. The identification was based on the fact that the spike (1) could be detected after the stimulus pulse with a short and fixed latency and (2) collided with a spontaneous orthodromic spike generated by the same neuron within a short time window prior to the electrical stimulus. On average, an antidromic spike, if any, occurred at a latency of 0.92 ± 0.07 ms (n = 88) in five intact animals, 1.05 ± 0.04 ms in unlesioned (n = 98), and 0.96 ± 0.08 ms (n = 115) in 6-OHDA-lesioned side of eight hemi-Parkinsonian animals and would be eliminated via the collision with a spontaneous spike occurring within a short interval (<1.0 ms) before the electrical stimulation in the STN. Furthermore, antidromic spikes could be identified only in the class of neurons that exhibited a low firing rate and long spike width, reinforcing the conclusion that these neurons are the CxFn. Those PNs that did not show antidromic spikes were considered as either non-CxFn or CxFn that were not antidromically activated under the experimental condition. The percentages of these neurons, CxFn, and INs are summarized in Table 1. These data were obtained from experiments in which the stimulation sites were confined to the lateral STN.Table 1Distribution of Interneurons and Projection Neurons with and without Antidromic Spikes Recorded in MIInterneurons (%)Projection Neurons without Antidromic Spikes (%)Projection Neurons with Antidromic Spikes (CxFn; %)Intact (five rats)52 (24.1%)76 (35.2%)88 (40.7%)Unlesioned (eight rats)60 (22.0%)115 (42.1%)98 (35.9%)6-OHDA-lesioned (eight rats)71 (24.6%)103 (35.6%)115 (39.8%)See also Figure S2. Open table in a new tab See also Figure S2. Since we could identify the antidromic spikes in CxFn unambiguously, we asked if there was any relationship between the antidromic spikes and the therapeutic action of STN-DBS. It has been pointed out that antidromic cortical excitation may not be as reliable as generally assumed (Chomiak and Hu, 2007Chomiak T. Hu B. Axonal and somatic filtering of antidromically evoked cortical excitation by simulated deep brain stimulation in rat brain.J. Physiol. 2007; 579: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). So first, we determined the reliability of antidromic spike generation by examining its success rates at different stimulation frequencies. In a pool of 115 CxFn from the lesioned side of eight hemi-Parkinsonian rats, the antidromic spike reliably followed each pulse at a low stimulation frequency. Over 80% of stimuli were followed by an antidromic spike when the stimulation frequency was from 0.2 Hz to 10 Hz. However, the reliability of an antidromic spike following an electrical stimulus decreased dramatically as the frequency of stimulation was increased, dropping to 46.8% ± 1.5% at 50 Hz, 26.9% ± 1.1% at 125 Hz, 16.1% ± 0.8% at 200 Hz, and 9.33% ± 0.43% at 250 Hz (Figure 2B). This decrease in the reliability of antidromic spike production with increasing stimulation frequency resulted in the highest frequency of antidromic spikes being produced at around 125 Hz stimulation rather than other frequencies (Figure 2C). Interestingly, within the therapeutic window of STN-DBS, i.e., 50–250 Hz, a positive correlation (R2 = 0.783) between the frequency of antidromic spikes and the beneficial effect of STN-DBS was observed (Figure 2D). In addition, we found that HFS stimulation confined to the medial STN rather than lateral STN resulted in a lower percentage of cortical neurons exhibiting antidromic spikes, which was also correlated with less motor improvement (Figure S3). As we have seen, at high frequencies of electrical stimulation, such as 125 Hz, a large percentage of antidromic spikes failed to be elicited. What impact did this have on the discharge pattern of the antidromic spikes produced? At a low frequency of stimulation (10 Hz), due to the high success rate, the spike density histogram (SDH) of antidromic spikes fitted well with a Gaussian distribution, indicating a regular pattern (Figure 2E). However, at 125 Hz STN-DBS (Figure 2F), the success or failure of the antidromic invasion became unpredictable, resulting in a highly random pattern of SDH that was best fit by the Poisson distribution. At even higher frequencies of stimulation (i.e., 200 Hz and 250 Hz), the randomness of the antidromic spikes remained, while the success rate of antidromic invasion decreased remarkably. We then examined the effects of a 6-OHDA lesion and STN stimulation on the firing rates of the layer V CxFn in the MI. To analyze the firing rate, the antidromic spikes were first removed from the spike traces (see Experimental Procedures). The average spontaneous firing rate of the CxFn was found to be reduced after 6-OHDA treatment (intact: 3.20 ± 0.23 Hz, n = 88, five rats; lesioned: 2.54 ± 0.17 Hz, n = 115, eight rats, p < 0.05, Figures 3A and 3B). In contrast, in the unlesioned side of the MI, no significant difference in the CxFn’s mean firing rate was found (3.43 ± 0.26 Hz, n = 98, eight rats, NS compared with intact animals). During the 2 min of STN-DBS at 125 Hz, a significant increase in the spontaneous firing of the CxFn in the 6-OHDA-lesioned hemisphere was observed (3.57 ± 0.19 Hz, n = 115, eight rats, p < 0.01 compared with DBS off; NS compared with unlesioned or intact animals). This effect of DBS was absent when the stimulus was delivered at a low frequency of 10 Hz. More importantly, the 6-OHDA lesion also altered the firing pattern of the CxFn by increasing episodes of burst firing, as defined by the Legendy surprise method, which could also be reversed by 125 Hz STN-DBS, but not at 10 Hz (Figures 3C–3E). The effects of high frequency STN-DBS on the firing activities of layer V MI neurons may underlie the motor improvement and be attributable to the antidromic activation from STN. Since Degos et al., 2008Degos B. Deniau J.M. Le Cam J. Mailly P. Maurice N. Evidence for a direct subthalamo-cortical loop circuit in the rat.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 27: 2599-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar showed evidence for a direct STN-cortex projection, it is important to consider the contribution of orthodromic activation in the MI in mediating the observed behavioral improvement. However, as shown in Figure S4, unlike the layer V neurons, 125 Hz STN-DBS did not result in changes in the firing rates of the layer III/IV neurons, the target of the STN-cortex orthodromic projection, arguing against a major contribution of this pathway. Apart from altering the firing rate and pattern of individual CxFn, dopamine depletion induced pathological activities in the MI at the population level. Figure 4A shows typical raster plots of 10 CxFn after the 6-OHDA lesion, showing clear synchrony among most of the neurons, which was confirmed by the cross-correlation analysis between pairs of neurons (Figure 4B). Interestingly, the degree of correlation was dramatically reduced when the burst firing was filtered out from analysis, indicating that the synchrony was a reflection of the abnormal burst firing. The pooled data from the recordings in five intact and eight hemi-PD rats confirmed this observation (Figure 4B). Power spectrum analysis of the local field potential (LFP) revealed the appearance of oscillatory activity at the beta band (∼20–30 Hz) after dopamine depletion (Figures 4C and 4D). STN-DBS at 125 Hz was highly effective in removing the abnormal synchrony among the neurons and the beta oscillations (Figures 4B and 4D). The strength of coupling between spike times and LFP at any given frequency, known as spike-field coherence, was also investigated. 6-OHDA lesion caused the coherence value to increase specifically at the beta band (20–30 Hz; Figures 5A and 5B). Interestingly, the delivery of 125 Hz STN-DBS eliminated this beta band spike-field coherence. In addition, the phase synchronization (or coherence phase) between spikes and LFP at the beta band was derived and presented as polar histogram (Figure 5C). It was clear that the 6-OHDA lesion induced a specific phase-locking phenomenon between spikes and LFP in beta band (91/115 pairs, eight rats), whereas the pairs from the intact and unlesioned side showed randomly distributed phases, ranging from 0° to 360° (intact: 88 pairs from five rats; unlesioned: 98 pairs from eight rats). During the delivery of 125 Hz STN-DBS, the specific phase-locking bias present in the 6-OHDA-lesioned condition was not notable. To elucidate the possible mechanism underlying antidromic spikes-mediated beneficial effect, we next asked the crucial question of whether antidromic spikes can directly modulate the firing properties of the CxFn. Since the DBS was delivered at a high frequency of 125 Hz, i.e., with an interstimulus interval of 8 ms, we analyzed the impact of STN-DBS by selecting and then aligning all those 8 ms time segments that contained antidromic spikes. A typical example is shown in Figure 6A (left panel). These time-aligned segments of neuronal activities revealed that the probability of firing of the CxFn was influenced by the 125 Hz HFS: a complete cessation of firing immediately following the antidromic spike that lasted for about 1 ms followed by an elevated firing probability in the subsequent 2 ms interval. The early depression of firing probably represents the refractory period of the antidromic spikes, while the delayed increase in firing probability could reflect a change in the intrinsic excitability of the neurons or functional connectivity within the local circuit as a consequence of antidromic spikes. In contrast, for those 8 ms segments that did not contain antidromic spikes, there was no change in the firing probability (Figure 6A, right panel). In the unlesioned side, no change in firing probability was found, whether DBS was turned on or off (Figure 6B). These results demonstrate that the antidromic spikes directly and selectively alter the firing probability of the layer V CxFn. On the other hand, when DBS was delivered at 10 Hz, in addition to the biphasic changes in firing probability immediately following the antidromic spikes, a slight increase in firing rate at a much delayed time of around 40–50 ms poststimulation was observed (Figure S3). This was likely the effect relayed to the cortex via the basal ganglia circuit under STN-DBS. Previous studies demonstrate that STN-DBS can modulate activities of the cortical motor areas in both PD patients (Cunic et al., 2002Cunic D. Roshan L. Khan F.I. Lozano A.M. Lang A.E. Chen R.

For instance, introgression of a major QTL for submergence tolerance (Sub1) into widely grown rice varieties has substantially improved yield in >15 million hectares of rain-fed low-land rice in South and Southeast Asia5.

This paper reports the use of submillimetre interferometry to obtain the first detection of a large Keplerian disk around a protostar in the earliest phase of evolution, the class 0 phase. Hitherto the smallest observed protostar-to-envelope mass ratio was about 2.1. The newly discovered protostar, L1527 IRS, has a mass of approximately 0.2 solar masses and a protostar-to-envelope mass ratio of about 0.2. L1527 already has a proto-planetary disk of at least seven Jupiter masses, similar to presumed planet-forming disks, so it appears to have all the elements of a solar system in the making. In their earliest stages, protostars accrete mass from their surrounding envelopes through circumstellar disks. Until now, the smallest observed protostar-to-envelope mass ratio was about 2.1 (ref. 1). The protostar L1527 IRS is thought to be in the earliest stages of star formation2. Its envelope contains about one solar mass of material within a radius of about 0.05 parsecs (refs 3, 4), and earlier observations suggested the presence of an edge-on disk5. Here we report observations of dust continuum emission and 13CO (rotational quantum number J = 2 → 1) line emission from the disk around L1527 IRS, from which we determine a protostellar mass of 0.19 ± 0.04 solar masses and a protostar-to-envelope mass ratio of about 0.2. We conclude that most of the luminosity is generated through the accretion process, with an accretion rate of about 6.6 × 10−7 solar masses per year. If it has been accreting at that rate through much of its life, its age is approximately 300,000 years, although theory suggests larger accretion rates earlier6, so it may be younger. The presence of a rotationally supported disk is confirmed, and significantly more mass may be added to its planet-forming region as well as to the protostar itself in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2016556242,"Macroautophagy is a bulk clearance mechanism in which the double-membraned phagophore grows and engulfs cytosolic material. In yeast, the phagophore nucleates from a cluster of 20-30 nm diameter Atg9-containing vesicles located at a multiprotein assembly known as the preautophagosomal structure (PAS). The crystal structure of a 2:2:2 complex of the earliest acting PAS proteins, Atg17, Atg29, and Atg31, was solved at 3.05 Å resolution. Atg17 is crescent shaped with a 10 nm radius of curvature. Dimerization of the Atg17-Atg31-Atg29 complex is critical for both PAS formation and autophagy, and each dimer contains two separate and complete crescents. Upon induction of autophagy, Atg17-Atg31-Atg29 assembles with Atg1 and Atg13, which in turn initiates the formation of the phagophore. The C-terminal EAT domain of Atg1 was shown to sense membrane curvature, dimerize, and tether lipid vesicles. These data suggest a structural mechanism for the organization of Atg9 vesicles into the early phagophore."

While the implication of ventral prefrontostriatal circuits in reward-based learning is well established, the neural underpinnings of punishment-based learning remain unclear. To elucidate the causal implication of brain regions that were related to punishment learning in a previous functional neuroimaging study, we tested the effects of brain damage on behavioral performance, using the same task contrasting monetary gains and losses. Cortical and subcortical candidate regions, the anterior insula and dorsal striatum, were assessed in patients presenting brain tumor and Huntington disease, respectively. Both groups exhibited selective impairment of punishment-based learning. Computational modeling suggested complementary roles for these structures: the anterior insula might be involved in learning the negative value of loss-predicting cues, whereas the dorsal striatum might be involved in choosing between those cues so as to avoid the worst."
https://openalex.org/W2125511352,"The formation of very wide binaries, such as the alpha Cen system with Proxima (also known as alpha Centauri C) separated from alpha Centauri (which itself is a close binary A/B) by 15000 AU, challenges current theories of star formation, because their separation can exceed the typical size of a collapsing cloud core. Various hypotheses have been proposed to overcome this problem, including the suggestion that ultra-wide binaries result from the dissolution of a star cluster - when a cluster star gravitationally captures another, distant, cluster star. Recent observations have shown that very wide binaries are frequently members of triple systems and that close binaries often have a distant third companion. Here we report Nbody simulations of the dynamical evolution of newborn triple systems still embedded in their nascent cloud cores that match observations of very wide systems. We find that although the triple systems are born very compact - and therefore initially are more protected against disruption by passing stars - they can develop extreme hierarchical architectures on timescales of millions of years as one component is dynamically scattered into a very distant orbit. The energy of ejection comes from shrinking the orbits of the other two stars, often making them look from a distance like a single star. Such loosely bound triple systems will therefore appear to be very wide binaries."

A number of studies have demonstrated a tight coupling between BOLD responses to sensory stimuli and power in the gamma band (30–100 Hz) of local field potential (LFP) signals (Goense and Logothetis, 2008Goense J.B.

Resting-state connectivity studies have proven useful for characterizing network architectures and for exploring pathological alterations in neurological and psychiatric diseases (Greicius, 2008Greicius M. Resting-state functional connectivity in neuropsychiatric disorders.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2008; 21: 424-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Matthews et al., 2006Matthews P.M. Honey G.D. Bullmore E.T.

Disease and the brain's dark energy.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2010; 6: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Although there has been a rapid increase in the number of resting-state connectivity studies and in the use of functional connectivity measures in general, there have been few studies of the neural basis of BOLD connectivity. This is at least partly due to the technical difficulty of obtaining simultaneous recordings from multiple network sites using depth electrodes in awake humans or animals. The only such study to date reported that gamma oscillations most strongly correlated with BOLD connectivity between auditory cortices in epilepsy patients (Nir et al., 2008Nir Y. Mukamel R. Dinstein I. Privman E. Harel M. Fisch L. Gelbard-Sagiv H. Kipervasser S. Andelman F. Neufeld M.Y. et al.Interhemispheric correlations of slow spontaneous neuronal fluctuations revealed in human sensory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1100-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), similar to the relationship previously reported between gamma oscillations and local BOLD signals. However, it is not clear whether the link between gamma oscillations and BOLD connectivity generalizes to other circuits. It is important to test how sensitive BOLD connectivity is to oscillatory frequencies lower than gamma because it is not necessary for local computation and large-scale communication to recruit the same frequencies of oscillatory activity. Rather, low frequencies may be advantageous and commonly used for interactions between distant brain areas (Fujisawa and Buzsáki, 2011Fujisawa S. Buzsáki G.

Donner T.H. Engel A.K. Spectral fingerprints of large-scale neuronal interactions.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 121-134PubMed Google Scholar). A number of electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that brain oscillations show statistically nested coupling, with low frequencies modulating high frequencies (Buzsáki and Wang, 2012Buzsáki G. Wang X.J. Mechanisms of gamma oscillations.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar; Jensen and Colgin, 2007Jensen O. Colgin L.L.

Low-frequency neuronal oscillations as instruments of sensory selection.Trends Neurosci. 2009; 32: 9-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Given that different oscillations are associated with different spatiotemporal scales (Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004Buzsáki G. Draguhn A. Neuronal oscillations in cortical networks.Science. 2004; 304: 1926-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar; von Stein and Sarnthein, 2000von Stein A. Sarnthein J. Different frequencies for different scales of cortical integration: from local gamma to long range alpha/theta synchronization.Int. J. Psychophysiol. 2000; 38: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar), cross-frequency coupling may integrate information transmission over a large-scale network with local cortical processing (Canolty and Knight, 2010Canolty R.T. Knight R.T. The functional role of cross-frequency coupling.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2010; 14: 506-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that (1) BOLD functional connectivity predominantly reflects low-frequency neural interactions between remote brain areas (e.g., alpha [8–13 Hz] and theta [4–8 Hz]); (2) low frequencies modulate local high-frequency activity (e.g., gamma), which predominantly reflects BOLD signals from an individual area; and (3) such cross-frequency coupling links BOLD correlations in distributed network nodes to local BOLD activations. To test our hypotheses, we first mapped out thalamo-cortical networks (i.e., network defined as a set of interconnected brain regions) derived from BOLD signals acquired from macaque monkeys. Given that task-free fMRI studies have involved various experimental conditions in humans (free gaze, eyes closed, and fixation) and monkeys (free gaze and anesthesia), our study incorporated three experimental conditions to allow generalization and ready comparison with the literature: a task-free, free-gaze condition, defined as resting state here; a fixation task; and anesthesia. We focused on a thalamo-cortical visual network constituted by the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), the temporal occipital area (TEO), area V4, and the pulvinar, which has been well studied in terms of its anatomical connectivity (e.g., Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Felleman D.J.

After verifying BOLD correlations across our visual network, we performed simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from the same four network areas and measured their functional connectivity based on LFPs. We included a thalamic nucleus, the pulvinar, in our study because the limited evidence available suggests that the thalamus makes an important contribution to cortical oscillations (Hughes et al., 2004Hughes S.W. Lörincz M. Cope D.W. Blethyn K.L. Kékesi K.A. Parri H.R. Juhász G. Crunelli V.

Llinás R.R. The functional states of the thalamus and the associated neuronal interplay.Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 649-742PubMed Google Scholar). We used a combination of fMRI retinotopic mapping (Arcaro et al., 2011Arcaro M.J. Pinsk M.A. Li X. Kastner S. Visuotopic organization of macaque posterior parietal cortex: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 2064-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and high-resolution structural MRI scans to target the four interconnected visual areas (Shipp, 2003Shipp S. The functional logic of cortico-pulvinar connections.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 1605-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar; Ungerleider et al., 2008Ungerleider L.G. Galkin T.W. Desimone R. Gattass R. Cortical connections of area V4 in the macaque.Cereb. Cortex. 2008; 18: 477-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Because inaccurate regions of interest (ROIs) have a detrimental effect on connectivity estimates (Smith et al., 2011Smith S.M. Miller K.L. Salimi-Khorshidi G. Webster M. Beckmann C.F. Nichols T.E. Ramsey J.D. Woolrich M.W. Network modelling methods for FMRI.Neuroimage. 2011; 54: 875-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar), the retinotopic mapping ensured that the spatial ROIs we used to extract average time series matched functional areal boundaries. The brain activation pattern evoked by the retinotopic mapping task was projected to the corresponding structural surface (see Figures S1A and S1B available online) to accurately delineate the border of cortical regions LIP, TEO, and V4 (Figure 1). The subcortical region, the pulvinar, was manually delineated based on anatomical criteria using high-resolution structural images (Figure 1). We first aimed to show fMRI networks consistent with previous macaque studies (Moeller et al., 2009Moeller S. Nallasamy N. Tsao D.Y. Freiwald W.A. Functional connectivity of the macaque brain across stimulus and arousal states.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 5897-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; Vincent et al., 2007Vincent J.L. Patel G.H.

Intrinsic functional architecture in the anaesthetized monkey brain.Nature. 2007; 447: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar), by calculating intrinsic voxelwise functional connectivity during anesthesia, the resting state, and a fixation task. For the anesthesia condition, we used the right LIP as the seed region to allow direct comparison with previous work (Moeller et al., 2009Moeller S. Nallasamy N. Tsao D.Y. Freiwald W.A. Functional connectivity of the macaque brain across stimulus and arousal states.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 5897-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; Vincent et al., 2007Vincent J.L. Patel G.H.

Intrinsic functional architecture in the anaesthetized monkey brain.Nature. 2007; 447: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). We calculated the correlation between the average time series from the right LIP and the time series from all other brain voxels, with the confounding variables regressed out. The right LIP showed significant connectivity (p < 0.001, corrected using Monte Carlo simulation) with the left LIP and the frontal eye field bilaterally (Figure S1C), as previously shown (Moeller et al., 2009Moeller S. Nallasamy N. Tsao D.Y. Freiwald W.A. Functional connectivity of the macaque brain across stimulus and arousal states.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 5897-5909Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; Vincent et al., 2007Vincent J.L. Patel G.H. Fox M.D. Snyder A.Z. Baker J.T. Van Essen D.C. Zempel J.M. Snyder L.H. Corbetta M. Raichle M.E. Intrinsic functional architecture in the anaesthetized monkey brain.Nature. 2007; 447: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). This connectivity pattern was consistent across all six monkeys. To establish functional connectivity across the visual thalamo-cortical network in the resting state, we performed a correlation analysis for our four ROIs, seeding LIP, V4, TEO, and the pulvinar in turn, during the awake conditions. There was robust connectivity between each seed region and the other ROIs. Figure 1 shows that the right V4 seed significantly correlated (p < 0.001, corrected using Monte Carlo simulation) with the ipsilateral LIP, TEO and the pulvinar (the same was true for the left V4 seed). Because the resting-state and fixation conditions showed a consistent functional connectivity pattern (Figure S1D), we combined the two conditions to increase the statistical power of the ROI-based analyses. These findings suggest that the architecture of spontaneous functional connectivity is robust across different resting-state conditions and can be replicated across animals. To allow subsequent comparison with the electrophysiological results, we next evaluated ROI-based BOLD functional connectivity between LIP, TEO, V4, and the pulvinar in the right hemisphere for the resting state and fixation task. The average time series from each ROI was extracted for each run in the native space, and Pearson's correlation coefficients between those time series were calculated for the epochs (437 ± 241 s) that were not contaminated by head movement. There was a significant correlation between each pair of regions (one-sample t test, p < 0.001; Figure S2). To control for the effect of eye movements, we also calculated Pearson's correlation between the BOLD activities corresponding to each stable-eye epoch (≥6.4 s) and observed a significant correlation between the ROIs (p < 0.01; Figure 2). Having established a robust resting-state fMRI network between V4, TEO, LIP, and the pulvinar, we next probed the electrophysiological basis of this BOLD connectivity. We derived power time series from the magnitude of the Hilbert transform for different frequency bands (Figure 3) from the LFPs simultaneously recorded in the pulvinar, LIP, TEO, and V4 (58 sessions from two monkeys, one of which was also scanned under anesthesia; see Figure S3 for finer frequency band divisions). These power time series were then band-pass filtered to 0.01–0.1 Hz to correspond to the main frequencies constituting the BOLD signal (Fox and Raichle, 2007Fox M.D. Raichle M.E. Spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 700-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (4937) Google Scholar). We performed correlation analyses on long and short epochs of the power time series. The long epochs included eye movements, as commonly used in resting-state studies, thereby allowing comparison with published results, whereas the short epochs only included stable eye positions (no eye movements; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for eye movement controls). The correlation analyses on long epochs (184 ± 84 s) showed significant correlations of power time series between ROIs for all frequency bands (one-sample t tests, p < 0.001). However, the low-frequency bands (theta, alpha, and beta) showed significantly higher correlation values than the gamma band (paired-sample t tests, p < 0.001, theta/alpha/beta versus gamma). Among the low-frequency bands, there were moderately but significantly higher correlation values for the alpha band compared with the theta and beta bands (p < 0.001, alpha versus theta/beta; p > 0.05, theta versus beta). Similarly, for stable-eye epochs, significant correlations were found in the power time series derived from all frequency bands (one-sample t tests, p < 0.001; Figures 3 and S3); but the low-frequency bands had significantly higher correlation values than the gamma band (paired-sample t tests, p < 0.001, theta/alpha/beta versus gamma), with the alpha band being moderately but significantly higher than the theta and beta bands (p < 0.001, alpha versus theta/beta; p > 0.05, theta versus beta). Overall, these results indicate that slow fluctuations in the power of low-frequency oscillations contributed most to the connectivity. To verify that power correlations predominantly resulted from slow oscillations (<0.1 Hz), we also applied the correlation analyses to the signals derived from band-pass filtering the power time series in two higher-frequency bands (0.1–1 Hz and >1 Hz). There were significantly higher correlation values for the 0.01–0.1 Hz band compared with both the 0.1–1 Hz band and the >1 Hz band (paired-sample t tests, p < 0.001). The major contribution of frequencies < 0.1 Hz is consistent with a recent study of bilateral primary auditory cortex (Nir et al., 2008Nir Y. Mukamel R. Dinstein I. Privman E. Harel M. Fisch L. Gelbard-Sagiv H. Kipervasser S. Andelman F. Neufeld M.Y. et al.Interhemispheric correlations of slow spontaneous neuronal fluctuations revealed in human sensory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1100-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, our findings suggest that in contrast to the current view on the predominant contribution from gamma activity, low-frequency oscillations are a major contributor to large-scale network connectivity. Slow oscillations (<0.1 Hz) are commonly thought to signal general changes in network excitability (Hughes et al., 2011Hughes S.W. Lorincz M.L. Parri H.R. Crunelli V. Infraslow (<0.1 Hz) oscillations in thalamic relay nuclei basic mechanisms and significance to health and disease states.Prog. Brain Res. 2011; 193: 145-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar; Monto et al., 2008Monto S. Palva S. Voipio J. Palva J.M. Very slow EEG fluctuations predict the dynamics of stimulus detection and oscillation amplitudes in humans.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8268-8272Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), whereas oscillations on a faster timescale (>1 Hz) may be better suited to more specific information exchange between areas. To measure interactions between network areas on a faster timescale, we calculated the coherence between the “raw” LFP signals (cf. power time series in the previous section) in each pair of network areas. The coherence measures the linear association between the LFPs as a function of oscillation frequency. For each recording session, we used multitaper methods (three tapers and ±4 Hz bandwidth) to estimate the coherence in every 500 ms time window for which there was no eye movement (excluding 0–200 ms after any preceding eye movement). The population mean coherence spectrum for each ROI pair showed the peak coherence at low frequencies (<20 Hz; Figure 4). Within a specified frequency band, we counted the number of sessions showing significant coherence for each pair of ROIs (jackknife variance estimates, p < 0.001). There was significant coherence in the 4–20 Hz range for 41–55 sessions (range across the six pairs of ROIs) out of the total of 58 sessions, whereas only 9–29 out of 58 sessions showed significant coherence in the 30–100 Hz range. Notably, the rank of connection strengths based on mean alpha coherence was similar to that seen in BOLD connectivity (Figure 2). For example, alpha coherence and BOLD connectivity both showed the strongest connection between the pulvinar and V4 and the weakest connection between the TEO and LIP. With respect to the greater effects at low versus high frequencies, these coherence results were consistent with that observed in the slow-wave power correlations. Thus, the coherence of neural activities on a fast timescale may give rise to the power correlation of band-limited neural activities at the slow fMRI timescale. Specifically, low-frequency oscillations (<20 Hz) may predominantly contribute to resting-state functional connectivity. Different frequencies of neural oscillations may be useful for different temporal and spatial scales: high frequencies like gamma for local computation, and lower frequencies like alpha for large-scale interactions. Because low-frequency oscillations have been shown to modulate high-frequency activity (Buzsáki and Wang, 2012Buzsáki G. Wang X.J. Mechanisms of gamma oscillations.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar; Canolty and Knight, 2010Canolty R.T. Knight R.T. The functional role of cross-frequency coupling.Trends Cogn.

We hypothesized that low frequencies may contribute to fluctuation of the power in the gamma band through a cross-frequency coupling mechanism. To measure cross-frequency coupling, we used the synchronization index (SI; Cohen, 2008Cohen M.X. Assessing transient cross-frequency coupling in EEG data.J. Neurosci.

However, the underlying mechanisms and clinical potentials of normoxic HIF-2α expression in NB still remain largely unknown. In this study, HIF-2α immunostaining was identified in 26/42 NB tissues, which was correlated with clinicopathological features. In subtotal 20 NB cases, microRNA-145 (miR-145) was downregulated and inversely correlated with HIF-2α expression. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a putative miR-145 binding site in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of HIF-2α messenger RNA (mRNA). Overexpression or knockdown of miR-145 responsively altered both the mRNA and protein levels of HIF-2α and its downstream genes, cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinase 14 and vascular endothelial growth factor, in normoxically cultured NB cell lines SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH. In a luciferase reporter system, miR-145 downregulated the luciferase activity of HIF-2α 3′-UTR, and these effects were abolished by a mutation in the putative miR-145-binding site. Overexpression of miR-145 suppressed the growth, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH cells in vitro and in vivo, while restoration of HIF-2α expression rescued the tumor cells from miR-145-mediated defects in these biological features. Furthermore, anti-miR-145 inhibitor rescued the HIF-2α knockdown-mediated repression on the growth, migration, invasion and angiogenesis of NB cells. These data indicate that miR-145 suppresses HIF-2α expression via the binding site in the 3′-UTR under normoxic conditions, thus inhibiting the aggressiveness and angiogenesis of NB."
https://openalex.org/W2041786202,"Auxotrophic markers - mutations within genes encoding enzymes in pathways for the biosynthesis of metabolic building blocks, such as an amino acid or nucleotide, are used as selection markers in the vast majority of yeast genetics and genomics experiments 1-3. The nutritional deficiency caused by the mutation (auxotrophy) can be compensated by supplying the required nutrient in the growth medium. This compensation, however, is not necessarily quantitative because such mutations influence a number of physiological parameters and may act in combination 2,4,5 . The construction of a prototrophic derivative of the parent strain of the widely used genome-scale yeast deletion collection1 has confirmed the need to remove auxotrophic markers in order to reduce bias in physiological and metabolic studies 2 . Moreover, flux balance analyses using a genome-wide metabolic model (Yeast 5)6 indicate that the activity status of some 200-300 reactions changes between different auxotrophic strains and the wild type. To alleviate this bias we have constructed a version of the haploid deletant collection restoring prototrophy in the genetic background, such that influence of auxotrophy to the phenotype of a given gene deletion is prevented. This new deletant library facilitates the exploitation of yeast in both functional genomics and quantitative systems biology.

The physiological impact of auxotrophy was assessed by monitoring the growth of 16 yeast strains carrying all possible combinations of the markers (histidine (his3Δ1), leucine (leu2Δ), methionine (met15Δ) and uracil (ura3Δ) used in the MATa version of the yeast deletion collection1. All markers and their combinations affected yeast growth, but without altering the adenylate (ATP, ADP, AMP) energy charge (Fig 1 a). As the most critical phenotypic quantity, the maximum specific growth rate (μmax) varied between 0.125 h−1 (leu2Δ) and 0.20 h−1 (his3Δmet15Δura3Δ), rendering quantitative comparisons between these strains impossible (Fig 1 a, Suppl. Table 1). These growth differences were not explained by the different media supplementations, as i) prototrophic yeast exhibited a different and substantially less diverse growth pattern in the 16 minimal media (Fig 1c, left panel; media recipes are given in the Supplementary material); and ii) growth differences where altered, but not abrogated, when other proteogenic amino acids were supplemented as well (synthetic complete (SC) medium; Fig 1b). Importantly, on both types of media, complex interactions between all auxotrophic mutations were observed. For instance, restoring MET15 in leu2Δura3Δhis3Δmet15Δ (0.185 h−1 → 0.164 h−1) or leu2Δura3Δmet15Δ (0.162 h−1 → 0.149 h−1) had a negative effect on μmax, but surprisingly promoted growth in leu2Δhis3Δmet15Δ (0.136 h−1 → 0.173 h−1) (Fig 1a); restoring LEU2 in leu2Δura3Δhis3Δ (0.164 h−1 → 0.185 h−1) or leu2Δura3Δmet15Δ (0.136 h−1 → 0.161 h−1) had a positive effect, but not in leu2Δura3Δhis3Δmet15Δ (0.185 h−1 → 0.186 h−1) (Fig 1a; Suppl. Table 1). Thus, although blocking different pathways, all markers influence each other, indicating that they have a wide-ranging and combinatorial influence on the metabolic network.

The combinatorial impact of yeast auxotrophic markers



In batch culture experiments, further problems arise from the unequal consumption of amino acid supplements resulting in cultivation phase-dependent starvation. Growth of BY4741 (the auxotrophic parent of the standard yeast gene-deletion collection 1) in SC media depleted nutrients in a way they became first limiting for met15Δ, then for leu2Δ, his3Δ1 and finally for ura3Δ auxotrophic yeast (Fig 1d). This effect could not be compensated by increasing amino acid supplementation(s), as this inhibited cell growth (Fig 1c, right panel).

Chronological lifespan (CLS) is a phenotype that is profoundly influenced by both nutrient supplementation and growth rate. Indeed, we observed an increase in stationary phase survival in YPD media upon restoring prototrophy. In a competitive growth experiment, auxotrophic cells had lost their colony-forming capacities within 10 days, but their prototrophic counterparts were perfectly viable for more than 20 days (Fig 1e). Longer CLS of prototrophic versus auxotrophic yeast was also reported for other backgrounds, and in synthetic media nutrient starvation shortened the lifespan of auxotrophic cells 7,8. Restoring protrotrophy is thus, to our knowledge, one of the most powerful genetic modifications for extending CLS.

Hence, as auxotrophic markers have substantial and combinatorial influences on fundamental biological parameters such as growth and ageing, auxotrophic genome resources introduce bias for analyzing physiological parameters and even more to quantitative studies addressing the metabolic network. We would thus encourage the yeast community to switch, where possible, to prototrophic yeast for experiments in transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.

To create a prototrophic resource for genome-scale experiments, we re-introduced auxotrophic markers into the MATa versions of the S288c-based deletion collection (5185 strains)1 and the titratable promoter essential collection (839 strains)3. These strains were transformed with a centromere-containing single-copy vector (minichromosome), containing the chromosome VI centromere, the autonomous replication sequence of HHF1 (ARSH4)9, and the marker genes HIS3, URA3, LEU2, and MET15 under control of their endogenous promoter sequences (pHLUM; Suppl Fig 1, Addgene ID 40276). Under non-selective conditions, the vector was transmitted in 99.15% of cell divisions (0.85% segregation mean over 20 generations). After 20 days, all cells were found prototrophic due to their positive selection (Fig 1e), facilitating screens on both selective and non-selective media. Furthermore, pHLUM- transformed BY4741 derivates wild type for HIS3, LEU2, MET15 or URA3 grew similar as BY4741 pHLUM (Suppl. Fig 2), indicating that the minichromosome fully restored prototrophy.

The titratable-promoter essential collection3 was exploited to demonstrate screening capacities. By replicating original and prototrophic strains onto doxycycline-containing media, we found that 13 of the 370 lethal phenotypes were compensated (Fig 1 f, Suppl. Table 2). Thus, auxotrophic markers do not only influence physiological parameters, they are also responsible for a number of essential phenotypes.

Since all strains possess a native metabolic network, the new library reduces bias from the use of auxotrophic markers in functional genomics and metabolic systems biology. Based on the pHLUM minichromosome, which is counterselectable, the new resource retains full compatibility with the popular S288c knock-out and essential collections 1,3. However, the use of a plasmid will introduce confounding factors to those mutants which have deficits in plasmid stability and segregation. The library is distributed as arrayed on 96-well plates (Euroscarf, Frankfurt), and contains a deep-red coloured and counter-selectable mutant (ade12Δ) on both universal and plate-specific positions, which simplifies plate orientation and identification, and can serve as replicate-control in quantitative metabolomics experiments (Suppl. Fig 3)."

The channel is closed at neutral pH and opens at acidic pH to allow the rapid access of urea to cytoplasmic urease. Urease produces NH(3) and CO(2), neutralizing entering protons and thus buffering the periplasm to a pH of roughly 6.1 even in gastric juice at a pH below 2.0. Here we report the structure of HpUreI, revealing six protomers assembled in a hexameric ring surrounding a central bilayer plug of ordered lipids. Each protomer encloses a channel formed by a twisted bundle of six transmembrane helices. The bundle defines a previously unobserved fold comprising a two-helix hairpin motif repeated three times around the central axis of the channel, without the inverted repeat of mammalian-type urea transporters. Both the channel and the protomer interface contain residues conserved in the AmiS/UreI superfamily, suggesting the preservation of channel architecture and oligomeric state in this superfamily. Predominantly aromatic or aliphatic side chains line the entire channel and define two consecutive constriction sites in the middle of the channel. Mutation of Trp 153 in the cytoplasmic constriction site to Ala or Phe decreases the selectivity for urea in comparison with thiourea, suggesting that solute interaction with Trp 153 contributes specificity. The previously unobserved hexameric channel structure described here provides a new model for the permeation of urea and other small amide solutes in prokaryotes and archaea."
https://openalex.org/W1973246303,"Lesions in human posterior parietal cortex can cause optic ataxia (OA), in which reaches but not saccades to visual objects are impaired, suggesting separate visuomotor pathways for the two effectors. In monkeys, one potentially crucial area for reach control is the parietal reach region (PRR), in which neurons respond preferentially during reach planning as compared to saccade planning. However, direct causal evidence linking the monkey PRR to the deficits observed in OA is missing. We thus inactivated part of the macaque PRR, in the medial wall of the intraparietal sulcus, and produced the hallmarks of OA, misreaching for peripheral targets but unimpaired saccades. Furthermore, reach errors were larger for the targets preferred by the neural population local to the injection site. These results demonstrate that PRR is causally involved in reach-specific visuomotor pathways, and reach goal disruption in PRR can be a neural basis of OA."
https://openalex.org/W2015497472,"The spectrum of a quasar at redshift 7.04 reveals absorption from a large column of foreground neutral hydrogen with no corresponding heavy elements; this absorbing gas is either diffuse and intergalactic but has not yet been ionized by starlight at this early epoch, or it is gravitationally bound to a proto-galaxy that has a chemical abundance <1/10,000 the solar level. Lower abundances of heavy elements, relative to those found in typical astrophysical environments, have been observed in Milky Way halo stars and in two quasar absorption systems at redshifts of z = 3. Such objects are widely interpreted as relics from the early Universe. This paper reports measurements of chemical abundances in the infrared spectra of a distant quasar at a redshift of z = 7.04, corresponding to a time when the Universe was only 5.6% of its present age. This epoch is thought to approach the time when the first stars—which produced the first heavy elements—were formed. The spectra reveal a large column of neutral hydrogen, but no heavy elements to sensitive upper limits, establishing these clouds as among the most chemically pristine neutral gas reservoirs known. This suggests that we may finally be witnessing the earliest generations of star formation. In typical astrophysical environments, the abundance of heavy elements ranges from 0.001 to 2 times the solar value. Lower abundances have been seen in selected stars in the Milky Way’s halo1,2,3 and in two quasar absorption systems at redshift z = 3 (ref. 4). These are widely interpreted as relics from the early Universe, when all gas possessed a primordial chemistry. Before now there have been no direct abundance measurements from the first billion years after the Big Bang, when the earliest stars began synthesizing elements. Here we report observations of hydrogen and heavy-element absorption in a spectrum of a quasar at z = 7.04, when the Universe was just 772 million years old (5.6 per cent of its present age). We detect a large column of neutral hydrogen but no corresponding metals (defined as elements heavier than helium), limiting the chemical abundance to less than 1/10,000 times the solar level if the gas is in a gravitationally bound proto-galaxy, or to less than 1/1,000 times the solar value if it is diffuse and unbound. If the absorption is truly intergalactic5,6, it would imply that the Universe was neither ionized by starlight nor chemically enriched in this neighbourhood at z ≈ 7. If it is gravitationally bound, the inferred abundance is too low to promote efficient cooling7,8, and the system would be a viable site to form the predicted but as yet unobserved massive population III stars."

https://openalex.org/W2038284708,"Increasing evidence suggests that mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) carrying specific mutations are at the origin of some sarcomas. We have reported that the deficiency of p53 alone or in combination with Rb (Rb−/− p53−/−) in adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) promotes leiomyosarcoma-like tumors in vivo. Here, we hypothesized that the source of MSCs and/or the cell differentiation stage could determine the phenotype of sarcoma development. To investigate whether there is a link between the source of MSCs and sarcoma phenotype, we generated p53−/− and Rb−/−p53−/− MSCs from bone marrow (BM-MSCs). Both genotypes of BM-MSCs initiated leiomyosarcoma formation similar to p53−/− and Rb−/−p53−/− ASCs. In addition, gene expression profiling revealed transcriptome similarities between p53- or Rb-p53-deficient BM-MSCs/ASCs and muscle-associated sarcomagenesis. These data suggest that the tissue source of MSC does not seem to determine the development of a particular sarcoma phenotype. To analyze whether the differentiation stage defines the sarcoma phenotype, BM-MSCs and ASCs were induced to differentiate toward the osteogenic lineage, and both p53 and Rb were excised using Cre-expressing adenovectors at different stages along osteogenic differentiation. Regardless the level of osteogenic commitment, the inactivation of Rb and p53 in BM-MSC-derived, but not in ASC-derived, osteogenic progenitors gave rise to osteosarcoma-like tumors, which could be serially transplanted. This indicates that the osteogenic differentiation stage of BM-MSCs imposes the phenotype of in vivo sarcoma development, and that BM-MSC-derived osteogenic progenitors rather than undifferentiated BM-MSCs, undifferentiated ASCs or ASC-derived osteogenic progenitors, represent the cell of origin for osteosarcoma development."

https://openalex.org/W2086036081,"Ovarian cancer G-protein-coupled-receptor-1 (OGR1) is a tumor metastasis suppressor in prostate cancer (PCa). OGR1 knockout mice (ogr1(-/-)) are grossly normal under physiological conditions, however, reduced melanoma tumorigenesis has been observed, with the mechanisms of this reduction completely unknown. In this work, we demonstrated that OGR1 deficiency in host cells significantly reduced tumorigenesis of PCa in mice. Adoptive transfer of WT CD11b(+) Gr1(+) double positive (DP) cells, but not T cells, was sufficient to allow tumor development in ogr1(-/-) mice. The expression of an M1 macrophage marker, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was higher and expression of an M2 macrophage marker, arginase-1 (Arg 1) was lower in tumors from ogr1(-/-) mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, coinjection of transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP)-C2 cells with WT, but not ogr1(-/-) macrophages, increased tumor incidence in ogr1(-/-) mice. T-cell depletion experiments suggested that T cells were required for tumor rejection in ogr1(-/-)mice, although OGR1 expression in T cells may not be necessary. In summary, the expression of OGR1 in myeloid-derived cells, especially in DP cells, was required for PCa tumor cell-induced immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W1966103152,"We have previously demonstrated that Krüppel-like factor 8 (KLF8) participates in oncogenic transformation of mouse fibroblasts and is highly overexpressed in human ovarian cancer. In this work, we first correlated KLF8 overexpression with the aggressiveness of ovarian patient tumors and then tested if KLF8 could transform human ovarian epithelial cells. Using the immortalized non-tumorigenic human ovarian surface epithelial cell line T80 and retroviral infection, we generated cell lines that constitutively overexpress KLF8 alone or its combination with the known ovarian oncogenes c-Myc, Stat3c and/or Akt and examined the cell lines for anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis. The soft agar clonogenic assay showed that T80/KLF8 cells formed significantly more colonies than the mock cells. Interestingly, the cells expressing both KLF8 and c-Myc formed the largest amounts of colonies, greater than the sum of colonies formed by the cells expressing KLF8 and c-Myc alone. These results suggested that KLF8 might be a weak oncogene that works cooperatively with c-Myc to transform ovarian cells. Surprisingly, overexpression of KLF8 alone was sufficient to induce tumorigenesis in nude mice resulting in short lifespan irrespective of whether the T80/KLF8 cells were injected subcutaneously, intraperitoneally or orthotopically into the ovarian bursa. Histopathological studies confirmed that the T80/KLF8 tumors were characteristic of human serous ovarian carcinomas. Comparative expression profiling and functional studies identified the cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and USP44 as primary KLF8 targets and effectors for the T80 transformation. Overall, we identified KLF8 overexpression as an important factor in human ovarian carcinoma pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2114795210,"Patients with acute lung injury (ALI) who retain maximal alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) have better clinical outcomes. Experimental and small clinical studies have shown that β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) agonists enhance AFC via a cAMP-dependent mechanism. However, two multicenter phase 3 clinical trials failed to show that β2AR agonists provide a survival advantage in patients with ALI. We hypothesized that IL-8, an important mediator of ALI, directly antagonizes the alveolar epithelial response to β2AR agonists. Short-circuit current and whole-cell patch-clamping experiments revealed that IL-8 or its rat analog CINC-1 decreases by 50% β2AR agonist-stimulated vectorial Cl(-) and net fluid transport across rat and human alveolar epithelial type II cells via a reduction in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator activity and biosynthesis. This reduction was mediated by heterologous β2AR desensitization and down-regulation (50%) via the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2)/PI3K signaling pathway. Inhibition of CINC-1 restored β2AR agonist-stimulated AFC in an experimental model of ALI in rats. Finally, consistent with the experimental results, high pulmonary edema fluid levels of IL-8 (>4000 pg/ml) were associated with impaired AFC in patients with ALI. These results demonstrate a novel role for IL-8 in inhibiting β2AR agonist-stimulated alveolar epithelial fluid transport via GRK2/PI3K-dependent mechanisms.-Roux, J., McNicholas, C. M., Carles, M., Goolaerts, A., Houseman, B. T., Dickinson, D. A., Iles, K. E., Ware, L. B., Matthay, M. A., Pittet, J.-F.

https://openalex.org/W2114372764,"The mechanism of release and the role of l-aspartate as a central neurotransmitter are controversial. A vesicular release mechanism for l-aspartate has been difficult to prove, as no vesicular l-aspartate transporter was identified until it was found that sialin could transport l-aspartate and l-glutamate when reconstituted into liposomes. We sought to clarify the release mechanism of l-aspartate and the role of sialin in this process by combining l-aspartate uptake studies in isolated synaptic vesicles with immunocyotchemical investigations of hippocampal slices. We found that radiolabeled l-aspartate was taken up into synaptic vesicles. The vesicular l-aspartate uptake, relative to the l-glutamate uptake, was twice as high in the hippocampus as in the whole brain, the striatum, and the entorhinal and frontal cortices and was not inhibited by l-glutamate. We further show that sialin is not essential for exocytosis of l-aspartate, as there was no difference in ATP-dependent l-aspartate uptake in synaptic vesicles from sialin-knockout and wild-type mice. In addition, expression of sialin in PC12 cells did not result in significant vesicle uptake of l-aspartate, and depolarization-induced depletion of l-aspartate from hippocampal nerve terminals was similar in hippocampal slices from sialin-knockout and wild-type mice. Further, there was no evidence for nonvesicular release of l-aspartate via volume-regulated anion channels or plasma membrane excitatory amino acid transporters. This suggests that l-aspartate is exocytotically released from nerve terminals after vesicular accumulation by a transporter other than sialin.—Morland, C., Nordengen, K., Larsson, M., Prolo, L. M., Farzampour, Z., Reimer, R. J., Gundersen, V. Vesicular uptake and exocytosis of L-aspartate is independent of sialin. FASEB J. 27, 1264–1274 (2013). www.fasebj.org"
https://openalex.org/W2004242184,"Reciprocal interactions between a tumor and its microenvironment control expansion of tumor cells. Here we show a specific type of interaction in which blasts of experimental leukemia destroy the bone marrow (BM) structures and kill stromal cells. The in vitro experiments showed that the cytotoxic agent released by leukemic cells is the fragmented DNA derived from their genome and occurring in nucleosome-like complexes. This DNA entered nuclei of BM or other cells and induced H2A.X phosphorylation at serine 139, similar to double-strand break-inducing agents. There was a correlation between large amounts of acquired DNA and death of recipient cells. Moreover, the DNA integrated into chromosomal DNA of recipient cells. Primary human acute myeloid leukemia cells also released fragmented DNA that penetrated the nuclei of other cells both in vitro and in vivo. We suggest that DNA fragments released from leukemic and also perhaps other types of tumor cells can activate DNA repair mechanisms or death in recipient cells of a tumor microenvironment, depending on the amount of the acquired DNA. This can impair DNA stability and viability of tumor stromal cells, undermine homeostatic capacity of tumor microenvironment and facilitate tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2024558767,"Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) is highly enriched on endocytic membranes via binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates through its FYVE (Fab1p-YOTB-Vps27p-EEA1) domain. SARA was originally identified as a protein that recruits non-phosphorylated SMAD2/3 to the activated TGFβ receptors for phosphorylation, but later reports suggested a regulatory role in endocytic trafficking. Here we demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase RNF11 is a SARA-interacting protein residing on early and late endosomes, as well as the fast recycling compartment. RNF11 and SARA interact with the ESCRT-0 subunits STAM2 and Eps15b, but only RNF11 associates with the core subunit Hrs. Both gain- and loss-of-function perturbation of RNF11 and SARA levels result in delayed degradation of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-activated EGF receptor (EGFR), while loss-of-function sustained/enhanced EGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that RNF11 and SARA are functional components of the ESCRT-0 complexes. Moreover, SARA interacts with clathrin, the ESCRT-I subunit Tsg101 and ubiquitinated cargo exhibiting all the properties of Hrs concerning ESCRT-0 function, indicating that it could substitute Hrs in some ESCRT-0 complexes. These results suggest that RNF11 and SARA participate structurally and functionally in the ESCRT-dependent lysosomal degradation of receptors. As a consequence, the negative influence that perturbation of RNF11 and SARA levels exerts on the lysosomal degradation of EGFRs could underscore the reported overexpression of RNF11 in several cancers. In these cancers, deficient termination of the oncogenic signaling of mutated receptors, such as the EGFRs, through suboptimal lysosomal degradation could contribute to the process of malignant transformation."
