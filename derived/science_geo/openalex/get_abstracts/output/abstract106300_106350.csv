https://openalex.org/W1537459781,"Integrins can function as signal-transducing receptors capable of modulating cell growth and gene expression (Juliano, R. L., and Haskill, S. (1993) J. Cell Biol. 120, 577-585; Hynes, R. O. (1992) Cell 69, 11-25). An early event in integrin signaling in fibroblasts and other cells involves activation of pp125FAK, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (Hanks, S. K., Calalb, M. B., Harper, M. C., and Patel, S. K. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 8487-8491; Schaller, M. D., Borgman, C. A., Cobb, B. S., Vines, R. R., Reynolds, A. B., and Parsons, J. T. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 5192-5196). Here we report a novel aspect of integrin-mediated signal transduction. We demonstrate that adhesion of cells to substrata coated with extracellular matrix proteins, or with a synthetic peptide containing the RGD sequence, can cause activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in 3T3 or REF52 fibroblasts. Activation of MAP kinases seems to depend on integrin engagement rather than simply on cell attachment. Thus, MAP kinases are activated when cells adhere to substrata coated with the integrin ligands fibronectin or laminin, but not when cells adhere to poly-D-lysine, a nonspecific adhesion-promoting polypeptide. Treatment of cells with cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin microfilament assembly, almost completely blocks adhesion-induced MAP kinase activation, indicating a critical role for the cytoskeleton. In REF52 cells, we have observed that activation of MAP kinases is accompanied by redistribution of the protein to the nucleus, suggesting that the activated kinases may impinge on factors regulating gene expression. Thus, integrin-mediated cell adhesion seems a sufficient stimulus to cause activation and nuclear translocation of MAP kinases. This may have important implications for the regulation of cell growth and differentiation by the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1570103822,"Human protein C and activated protein C are shown to bind to endothelium specifically, selectively and saturably (Kd = 30 nM, 7000 sites per cell) in a Ca(2+)-dependent fashion. Expression cloning revealed a 1.3-kilobase pair cDNA that coded for a novel type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein capable of binding protein C. This protein appears to be a member of the CD1/major histocompatibility complex superfamily. Like thrombomodulin, the receptor involved in protein C activation, the endothelial cell protein C receptor function and message are both down-regulated by exposure of endothelium to tumor necrosis factor. Identification of endothelial cell protein C receptor as a member of the CD1/major histocompatibility complex superfamily provides insights into the role of protein C in regulating the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1529983307,"The role of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta type II receptor in reversing the malignant phenotype of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells was examined. MCF-7 cells were insensitive to TGF beta 1 and expressed undetectable levels of cell surface TGF beta type I receptor (RI) and type II receptor (RII) by cross-linking with 125I-TGF beta 1. Stable transfection of a RII expression vector yielded 3 transfectants with varying levels of exogenous RII mRNA and protein levels. Expression of RII also increased TGF beta 1 binding to RI in all 3 clones. Proliferation of RII-positive clones was inhibited by exogenous TGF beta 1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the control clones remained TGF beta-insensitive. The RII transfectants were growth arrested in monolayer culture at saturation densities which were 41-66% of that of the Neo controls. They also showed reduced clonogenicity in soft-agarose. Tumorigenicity in ovariectomized, estrogen-supplemented nude mice was delayed in transfectants with low RII levels. Transfectants expressing high levels of RII showed a large reduction in tumorigenicity as well as a longer delay in tumor formation. Tumor growth was associated with loss of exogenous RII expression in transfectants. The results indicate that when systems for TGF beta signal transduction are intact, reconstitution of the TGF beta receptor system can lead to reversion of malignancy in cells lacking RII."
https://openalex.org/W1580210576,"Glutathione (GSH) is one of the most important physiological antioxidants involved in detoxification of hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxide. Previous studies have shown that cells can maintain and even increase cellular GSH content in response to sublethal oxidative stress. We hypothesized that gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma GCS), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo GSH synthesis, could be induced by oxidative stress. Rat lung epithelial L2 cells were challenged with 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ), generates O2.- and H2O2 continuously through redox cycling. Exposure of confluent L2 cells with sublethal doses of DMNQ caused sustained elevation of cellular GSH levels over a 24-h period (to 2.5-fold with 10 microM). DMNQ caused increases in gamma GCS activity (70% at 24 h with 10 microM), the gamma GCS catalytic heavy subunit (gamma GCS-HS) protein level, and gamma GCS-HS mRNA content (approximately 4-fold after 6 h with 10 microM). The elevation of gamma GCS-HS mRNA by DMNQ was eliminated by co-incubation with actinomycin D. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrated that the transcriptional rate of the gamma GCS-HS gene was increased by 3- or 6-h exposure to 10 microM DMNQ. Our results suggested that the induction of de novo GSH synthesis by naphthoquinone-induced oxidative stress is associated with the transcriptional activation of the gamma GCS-HS gene and the subsequent elevation in gamma GCS activity. Unlike simpler quinones, DMNQ cannot form a GSH conjugate. Thus, the induction of gamma GCS-HS gene transcription does not require formation of an electrophile-glutathione conjugate."
https://openalex.org/W1502098090,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) has multiple biological functions including the prolonged activation of the collagenase and c-jun genes, which are regulated via their AP-1 binding sites. We show that incubating human fibroblasts with TNF alpha induces prolonged activation of JNK, the c-Jun kinase, which phosphorylates the transactivation domain of c-Jun. Furthermore, an immune complex kinase assay specifically demonstrates that TNF alpha stimulates the activity of JNK1, the recently described predominant form of JNK. TNF alpha also produces a small and transient increase in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity and no measured increase in Raf-1 kinase activity. On the other hand, epidermal growth factor causes a prolonged activation of Raf-1 kinase and ERK activity and a smaller, more transient activation of JNK, whereas the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate causes a small stimulation of Raf-1 kinase and a pronounced stimulation of ERK activity. The activation of JNK by TNF alpha does not correlate with Raf-1 or ERK activity. The kinetics of Raf-1, ERK, and JNK induction by epidermal growth factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or TNF alpha indicate distinct mechanisms of activation in human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1631361623,"The signal transduction pathways that mediate activation of trans acting factors controlling an organ's response to ischemia are unknown. The stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), a subfamily of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), phosphorylate c-Jun within the amino-terminal transactivation domain and are activated in response to a variety of cellular stresses. We determined whether SAPKs are activated in response to ischemia, an extreme, albeit common, pathophysiologic stress. Rats underwent 40 min of renal ischemia followed by reperfusion for 0, 5, 20, or 90 min. SAPKs were immunoprecipitated from kidney lysates and kinase activity assayed with recombinant GST-c-Jun(1-135), containing the amino-terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun as substrate. SAPKs were not activated by ischemia alone, but reperfusion for as little as 5 min was associated with a 4.6-fold increase in kinase activity. Kinase activity was increased 7.6-fold at 20 min following reperfusion and remained elevated at 90 min of reperfusion (4.9-fold). In contrast, activity of the related ERK-1 and -2 was increased only 1.3-fold and only at the 5-min reperfusion time point. When SAPKs were immunodepleted from kidney extracts prior to incubation of the extracts with agarose-coupled GST-c-Jun(1-135), it was found that SAPKs accounted for the majority of the amino-terminal c-Jun kinase activity of kidney at 5 min following reperfusion. In Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, ATP repletion, following ATP depletion induced by chemical anoxia, was associated with a 9-15-fold activation of SAPKs with a similar time course of activation to that seen in the kidney after ischemia and reperfusion. In conclusion, the SAPKs are markedly activated very early after reperfusion of ischemic kidney and following ATP repletion of anoxic cells in culture. We propose that this activation of SAPKs may trigger part of the kidney's early genetic response to ischemia, possibly by enhancing trans acting activity of c-Jun."
https://openalex.org/W2099930038,"Immunoglobulin (Ig) E antibodies mediate allergic responses by binding to specific high affinity receptors, Fc epsilon RI, on mast cells and basophils. Previous studies have shown that the principal Fc epsilon RI binding site is located on the third constant domain, Fc epsilon 3, of IgE. Based on a model of the IgE Fc epsilon 3 (which is homologous to the second constant domain of IgG), homology scanning mutagenesis and replacement of individual residues were used to determine the specific amino acids of human IgE involved in binding to human Fc epsilon RI. The amino acids are localized in three loops, which form a putative ridge on the most exposed side of the Fc epsilon 3 domain of IgE and include Arg-408, Ser-411, Lys-415, Glu-452, Arg-465, and Met-469. The preponderance of charged residues suggests that IgE-Fc epsilon RI binding is mediated primarily by electrostatic interaction. Furthermore, it is possible to confer Fc epsilon RI binding to an IgG molecule by introducing these three IgE loops into the IgG C gamma 2 domain."
https://openalex.org/W2103073125,"L-735,524 is a potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease currently in a Phase II clinical trial. We report here the three-dimensional structure of L-735,524 complexed to HIV-2 protease at 1.9-A resolution, as well as the structure of the native HIV-2 protease at 2.5-A resolution. The structure of HIV-2 protease is found to be essentially identical to that of HIV-1 protease. In the crystal lattice of the HIV-2 protease complexed with L-735,524, the inhibitor is chelated to the active site of the homodimeric enzyme in one orientation. This feature allows an unambiguous assignment of protein-ligand interactions from the electron density map. Both Fourier and difference Fourier maps reveal clearly the closure of the flap domains of the protease upon L-735,524 binding. Specific interactions between the enzyme and the inhibitor include the hydroxy group of the hydroxyaminopentane amide moiety of L-735,524 ligating to the carboxyl groups of the essential Asp-25 and Asp-25' enzymic residues and the amide oxygens of the inhibitor hydrogen bonding to the backbone amide nitrogen of Ile-50 and Ile-50' via an intervening water molecule. A second bridging water molecule is found between the amide nitrogen N2 of L-735,524 and the carboxyl oxygen of Asp-29'. Although other hydrogen bonds also add to binding, an equally significant contribution to affinity arises from hydrophobic interactions between the protease and the inhibitor throughout the pseudo-symmetric S1/S1', S2/S2', and S3/S3' regions of the enzyme. Except for its pyridine ring, all lipophilic moieties (t-butyl, indanyl, benzyl, and piperidyl) of L-735,524 are rigidly defined in the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1592350719,"Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-9 regulate the proliferation of T lymphocytes through interactions with their receptors. Previous studies have shown that unknown tyrosine kinases are involved in the proliferative signaling triggered by IL-4 and IL-9. Here we show that IL-4 and IL-9 induce overlapping (170, 130, and 125 kilodalton (kDa)) and distinct (45 and 88/90 kDa, respectively) protein tyrosine phosphorylation in T lymphocytes. We further identify the 170-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein as 4PS/insulin receptor substrate-1-like (IRS-1L) protein and 130-kDa protein as JAK1 kinase. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that JAK1 forms complexes with the IL-4 receptor and 4PS/IRS-1L protein following ligand-receptor interaction. In addition, we demonstrate that IL-9, but not IL-4, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat 91 transcriptional factor. The overlapping and distinct protein tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the same JAK1 kinase in T lymphocytes strongly suggests that IL-4 and IL-9 share the common signal transduction pathways and that the specificity for each cytokine could be achieved through the unique tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins triggered by individual cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1657935059,"Ribonuclease A (RNase A) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are selectively taken up and degraded by isolated rat liver lysosomes by very similar processes. The uptake and degradation of both of these proteins are stimulated by the heat shock cognate protein of 73 kDa and ATP/Mg2+. Both binding and uptake of RNase A and GAPDH by lysosomes are saturable, and uptake of RNase A and GAPDH requires a protease-sensitive component within the lysosomal membrane. GAPDH competes for binding and uptake of RNase A by lysosomes and vice versa while another protein, ovalbumin, does not compete. RNase S-peptide (amino acids 1-20 of RNase A) also competes for RNase A binding and uptake by lysosomes, while RNase S-protein (amino acids 21-124 of RNase A) does not compete. The uptake of RNase A by lysosomes appears to involve an intermediate step in which approximately 2 kDa of the polypeptide's COOH terminus remains outside lysosomes while the remainder is inside the lysosomal lumen."
https://openalex.org/W1560216625,"In previous studies (Xu, A., Hawkins, C., and Narayanan, N. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 8394-8397), the Ca(2+)-ATPase of cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2) was shown to be phosphorylated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase) on a serine residue, likely to be either Ser38, Ser167, or Ser531. SERCA2 and SERCA2 mutants S38A, S167A, and S531A were expressed in HEK-293 cells and tested for phosphorylation with CaM kinase. Mutant S38A was not phosphorylated, while mutants S167A and S531A were phosphorylated, suggesting that Ser38 is the site of CaM kinase phosphorylation in SERCA2. This conclusion was supported by the observation that phosphorylation of SERCA2 and mutants S167A and S531A by CaM kinase increased the Vmax for Ca2+ transport, while the Vmax for Ca2+ transport by mutant S38A was unaffected by exposure to a phosphorylation reaction mix. SERCA1, containing a potential CaM kinase phosphorylation site at Ser167 and two SERCA1 mutants, K35R plus H38S and T532S, in which potential CaM kinase sites were created, were not phosphorylated by CaM kinase, and Vmax for Ca2+ transport was unaffected by exposure to a phosphorylation reaction mix. Thus phosphorylation of Ser38 in SERCA2 results in a unique activation of Vmax for Ca2+ transport, providing a potential regulatory mechanism for Ca2+ removal from cardiac and other tissues in which SERCA2 is expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1505310544,"A new member of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family that binds and internalizes very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles was previously cloned and characterized from the rabbit and human. The physiological role of this putative VLDL receptor is not known, but its tissue distribution and ligand specificity suggest a possible role in the delivery of triglycerides to peripheral tissue. To learn more about the potential function of this receptor, we measured the changes in VLDL receptor mRNA and protein in various tissues following dietary or hormonal manipulation of rats. No significant changes in the VLDL receptor mRNA or protein were seen after a 48-h fast and subsequent to refeeding. A striking change in receptor mRNA and protein was observed in skeletal muscle of hypothyroid and hyperthyroid rats. In hypothyroid rats, the amount of immunodetectable VLDL receptor was reduced by 80%, while in the hyperthyroid animals it was increased by 300%. These maneuvers did not affect VLDL receptor mRNA or protein levels in adipose tissue or heart. The changes in VLDL receptor mRNA in muscle were opposite to those observed with lipoprotein lipase. These studies suggest that the VLDL receptor plays a role in a metabolic process in muscle that is regulated by thyroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1508385406,"Neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF) is a hookworm-derived glycoprotein ligand of the integrin CD11b/CD18 that inhibits human neutrophil function (Moyle, M., Foster, D. L., McGrath, D. E., Brown, S. M., Laroche, Y., De Meutter, J., Stanssens, P., Bogowitz, C. A., Fried, V. A., Ely, J. A., Soule, H. R., and Vlasuk, G. P. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1008-10015). Here, we present evidence that recombinant NIF (rNIF) associates with the approximately 200-amino acid residue I domain of CD11b/CD18 and that this interaction is essential for inhibition of neutrophil function by NIF. First, radiolabeled rNIF binds to a recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein that contains the CD11b I domain. This high affinity interaction has a partial dependence on divalent cations. The association of rNIF with the CD11b I domain is specific because 125I-rNIF does not bind either a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein that contains the I domain of the integrin CD11a/CD18 or recombinant glutathione S-transferase without the I domain. Second, the CD11b I domain fusion protein effectively competes with CD11b/CD18 on human neutrophils for 125I-rNIF binding. Third, the CD11b I domain fusion protein blocks the inhibition of certain neutrophil functions by rNIF, including adhesion of neutrophils to human endothelial cell monolayers and adhesion-dependent release of hydrogen peroxide from neutrophils. Specificity is demonstrated by the inability of the CD11a I domain fusion protein to block either rNIF binding to neutrophils or rNIF activity. Fourth, rNIF blocks the interaction between neutrophils and fibrinogen, a CD11b/CD18 ligand that is also thought to bind the I domain of CD11b. In contrast, rNIF does not appear to block the binding of factor X to CD11b/CD18 on neutrophils. These results suggest that CD11b/CD18 has multiple distinct binding sites for its cognate ligands, including, but not limited to, the I domain. NIF interferes with the binding of a subset of these CD11b/CD18 ligands in a highly selective manner."
https://openalex.org/W1546144313,"It has recently been established that rat heart mitochondria contain two isoforms of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I), the minor 88-kDa variant being identical to liver CPT I (L-CPT I) and the dominant 82-kDa form resembling the skeletal muscle enzyme (M-CPT I) (Weis, B. C., Esser, V., Foster, D. W., and McGarry, J. D. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 18712-18715). To quantify the functional contribution of L-CPT I to overall CPT I activity in heart mitochondria a selective inhibitor of the former was needed. The dinitrophenol analog of 2[6-(4-chlorophenoxy)hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylic acid (etomoxir) (DNP-Et) was found to have this property. When liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria were exposed to DNP-Et in the presence of ATP and CoASH, the DNP-Et-CoA formed completely inhibited liver CPT I while leaving the muscle enzyme unaffected. Similar treatment of heart mitochondria blocked only the L-CPT I component. This had the effect of shifting the apparent Km for carnitine from approximately 200 to approximately 500 microM and the I50 value for malonyl-CoA (the concentration needed to suppress enzyme activity by 50%) from approximately 0.18 to approximately 0.06 microM, i.e. the heart system now behaved exactly the same as that from skeletal muscle. Taking the Km for carnitine of L-CPT I and M-CPT I to be 30 and 500 microM, respectively, it could be calculated that the former contributes approximately 2% to the total CPT I in heart. When the 82-kDa CPT I isoforms of heart and skeletal muscle were labeled with [3H]etomoxir and then exposed to trypsin, the fragmentation patterns obtained were identical and quite distinct from that given by CPT I from liver. We conclude that (i) DNP-Et, unlike other agents of the oxirane carboxylic acid class, has remarkable inhibitory selectivity for L-CPT I over M-CPT I; (ii) the previously puzzling observation that rat heart CPT I displays kinetic characteristics intermediate between those of the enzymes from liver and skeletal muscle is entirely accounted for by the low level expression of L-CPT I in the cardiac myocyte; and (iii) the dominant 82-kDa CPT I isoform in heart is identical to the muscle enzyme. The data reaffirm that, in contrast to CPT II, CPT I exists in at least two isoforms and that both are present in rat heart."
https://openalex.org/W1573477696,"The accumulation of the alarmone guanosine-3‘,5‘-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) in response to amino acid starvation or energy source depletion mediates the coordinate inhibition of macromolecular and membrane phospholipid biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. Accumulation of ppGpp triggered by the induced expression of either the relA gene or an unregulated, truncated relA gene that encodes a constitutively active ppGpp synthetase I, inhibited both de novo fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis and the incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into phospholipid. ppGpp inhibition of fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis was associated with an accumulation of long-chain acyl-ACP, the end products of fatty acid biosynthesis, and substrates for the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (the plsB gene product). Overexpression of the plsB gene product relieved the inhibition of fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis, prevented the accumulation of long-chain acyl-ACPs, and allowed an increase in cell size following elevation of intracellular ppGpp. However, stable RNA accumulation and cell division were still blocked by ppGpp accumulation. These data show that the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase mediates the ppGpp-dependent regulation of fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1583445344,"The yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase is composed of two nuclear encoded subunits, a catalytic core (Rpo41p), which resembles the enzymes from bacteriophage T7 and T3, and a specificity factor required for promoter recognition (Mtf1p), which is similar to members of the eubacterial sigma factor family. Using mitochondrial RNA polymerase reconstituted from highly purified subunits, we have determined that Rpo41p and Mtf1p interact to form a holoenzyme in solution prior to DNA binding and promoter recognition. We analyzed the composition of the polymerase during and after the initiation of transcription and found that, like the eubacterial sigma factors, Mtf1p is released after initiation and is available to catalyze transcription on a second template. By analyzing gel mobility shift complexes of the RNA polymerase and DNA at different stages of the transcription reaction, we found that both subunits were associated with DNA prior to initiation and after the formation of two phosphodiester bonds. After the formation of a 13-nucleotide transcript, Mtf1p is no longer associated with Rpo41p on the DNA. These data establish that Mtf1p is functionally as well as structurally similar to eubacterial sigma factors."
https://openalex.org/W1494422234,"The mitochondrial outer membrane of eukaryotic cells contains a voltage-dependent anion channel termed porin. In the organisms studied so far only one type of porin has been identified at the protein level. Here we present a biochemical and molecular genetic analysis of two different porin polypeptides of M(r) 34,000 and 36,000 from the outer membranes of potato mitochondria (termed POM 34 and POM 36, respectively). N-terminal sequencing and the use of labeled oligonucleotide mixtures derived from these amino acid sequences allowed the isolation of cDNA clones encoding the 34- and 36-kDa proteins. They have similar steady state protein levels and share about 75% identical amino acids suggesting that they represent isoforms. In addition, a third cDNA clone coding for a slightly different isoform of the 36-kDa protein was characterized. The polypeptides encoded by the three cDNA clones share the highest degree of sequence identity with mitochondrial porins from fungi and mammals. Tentative models of the secondary structure of the 34- and 36-kDa proteins suggest the occurrence of a 16-stranded beta-barrel typical for bacterial and mitochondrial porins. Purification of the 34-kDa protein by hydroxyapatite chromatography allowed conductance measurements in artificial bilayers. The 34-kDa protein is a voltage-dependent, channel-forming component with single channel conductances of 3.5 and 2.0 nanosiemens in 1 M KCl. In spite of the striking functional similarities to mitochondrial porins from other organisms neither the 34- nor the 36-kDa proteins are able to complement the respiratory defect of a yeast por- mutant."
https://openalex.org/W1535126000,"In this study we have determined the role of cyclic AMP on the function and differentiation of beta-endorphin (beta-EP) neurons in rat fetal hypothalamic cell cultures. Addition of Bt2cAMP or the cAMP elevating agent, forskolin, in cultures, dose and time dependently increased beta-endorphin secretion. The increased beta-EP secretion after Bt2cAMP or forskolin treatment was associated with proopiomelanocortin gene expression, enhanced neurite growth, and increased neuronal viability. Determination of internucleosomal cleavage of DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that apoptosis occurred in hypothalamic neurons during the first 6-8 days in culture. Addition of Bt2cAMP during this developmental period inhibited DNA degradation in hypothalamic neurons. Furthermore, incubation with various doses of ethanol, which is known to reduce intracellular levels of Bt2cAMP, increased DNA degradation in these cells. Ethanol-induced DNA degradation was blocked by concomitant incubation with Bt2cAMP. Histochemical identification of apoptotic cells following ethanol and Bt2cAMP treatments further revealed that apoptosis occurred in beta-EP neurons during the developmental period, and that ethanol increased and Bt2cAMP reduced apoptotic beta-EP cell numbers. These results suggest that ethanol neurotoxicity on beta-EP neurons during early neuronal differentiation involves an apoptotic process and that the cAMP signaling system plays an important role in controlling apoptosis and differentiation of the beta-EP neuronal system."
https://openalex.org/W1520416422,"The CheY protein from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium are among the best characterized proteins of the receiver domain family of two component signal transduction systems in bacteria. Phosphorylation of CheY plays a central role in bacterial chemotaxis. However, it is not entirely clear how its state of phosphorylation contributes to its function. Genetic evidence suggests that CheY changes its conformation upon phosphorylation. We present evidence for this conformation change by comparing the NMR 15N-1H correlation spectra of CheY.Mg2+ complex and phospho-CheY in the presence of magnesium. Large changes in chemical shift are used as indicators of chemical changes and probable structural changes in the protein backbone. Our observations suggest that significant structural changes occur in CheY upon phosphorylation and that these changes are distinct from the changes produced by magnesium ion binding. In addition to residues Asn-59 and Gly-65 that are immediately adjacent to the site of phosphorylation at Asp-57, a large number of other residues show significant chemical shift changes as a result of phosphorylation. These include Met-17, Val-21, Asn-23, Gly-39, Met-60, Met-63, Asp-64, Leu-66, Glu-67, Leu-68, Leu-69, Met-85, Val-86, Thr-87, Ala-88, Asn-94, Val-107, Lys-109, Thr-112, Ala-113, Ala-114, and Asn-121. These results appear inconsistent with the recent suggestion that phosphorylation produces the same structural changes as magnesium binding (Bellsolell, L., Prieto, J., Serrano, L., and Coll, M. (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 238, 489-495). We find that some regions change overlap with a genetically defined motor binding face. We therefore propose that the conformation switch modulates the interaction of CheY with its target, the flagellar motor. Other regions also change, possibly reflecting the many different functions of CheY homologues."
https://openalex.org/W1593168979,"The gene for the human recombinant eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (rEDN) was synthesized and fused to the gene encoding a single chain antibody (sFv) to the human transferrin receptor (EDNsFv). Both rEDN and EDNsFv were expressed as insoluble proteins in inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Following denaturation and renaturation, EDN and EDNsFv were partially purified by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose. Final purification of EDN was achieved by Sephadex G-100, whereas EDNsFv which contained a 6-histidyl residue carboxyl terminus was highly purified using the metal chelate resin, Ni(2+)-nitriloacetic acid. Whereas the recombinant EDN had ribonuclease activity that was similar to the native protein, the fusion protein had enzymatic activity that was 6-13% that of native EDN. The fusion protein was able to bind to the human transferrin receptor. In contrast to rEDN that had no inherent cytotoxicity to human tumor cells, the EDNsFv fusion protein was cytotoxic to human leukemia cells that express the human transferrin receptor with an IC50, 0.2-1 nM. At 1.3 nM EDNsFv, no cytotoxicity was observed on cells that lack the human transferrin receptor. Free antibody to the human transferrin receptor, E6, inhibited the cytotoxicity of the EDNsFv. Human enzymes may be engineered to acquire cytotoxic properties by fusing them to antibodies. Thus, they may be candidates for the construction of immunofusion proteins that may be less immunogenic than immunotoxins containing bacterial- or plant-derived toxin moieties."
https://openalex.org/W1538557493,"We report that two isoforms of Drosophila tyrosine hydroxylase protein are encoded via alternatively spliced exons. The major isoform (Type II) contains a novel acidic extension of 71 amino acids in the amino-terminal regulatory domain, which is likely to alter the regulatory properties of the tyrosine hydroxylase protein. The minor isoform (Type I) corresponds to the cDNA sequence reported previously. We also report the structure of the Drosophila tyrosine hydroxylase (DTH) gene and the diversity and tissue localization of its transcripts. At least three types of DTH mRNA are generated from a single primary transcript through alternative splicing and polyadenylation. Type II mRNA is the most abundant tyrosine hydroxylase transcript in Drosophila and is found predominantly in the hypoderm throughout all stages of development. Type I mRNA is present only in the CNS, where it is the primary form. The DTH transcripts detected in the CNS contain a longer 3'-untranslated region than the transcript expressed in the hypoderm, due to differential polyadenylation. In contrast, the same start site is used for DTH gene transcription in both tissues. These results show unexpected diversity in the DTH transcripts and point out possible mechanisms for differential regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the CNS and in the hypoderm."
https://openalex.org/W1623067816,"Efforts to understand the impact of core promoter architecture on the mechanism of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II have been hampered by lack of well defined, reconstituted transcription systems responsive both to efficiently transcribed consensus and near consensus TATA box-containing promoters and to considerably weaker TATA-less promoters. In this report, we investigate the influence of core promoter structure on the mechanism of assembly of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex using a highly purified, holoTFIID-dependent transcription system that permits sensitive measurement of transcription initiation from a wide variety of TATA and TATA-less promoters in the absence of transactivators. A direct comparison of the requirements for formation of stable preinitiation intermediates at these promoters led to the discovery that, whereas holoTFIID binds avidly to the consensus TATA- and strong initiator-containing adenovirus major late (AdML) promoter to form the first stable intermediate on the pathway leading to formation of the complete preinitiation complex, it binds poorly not only to TATA-less promoters but also to promoters with consensus or near consensus TATA elements. With the exception of the AdML promoter, formation of stable preinitiation intermediates at each of the promoters tested was found to be strongly dependent on RNA polymerase II, holoTFIID, and TFIIB and was stimulated by TFIIF. Based on these observations, we suggest that RNA polymerase II assembles with many TATA and TATA-less promoters by a common pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1522298610,"Secretion of Cl- by epithelial cells is fundamental to the processes of fluid and electrolyte transport by epithelia such as those of the airways, sweat-ducts, and gastrointestinal tract. In the present study, we show that a novel Cl- channel protein, immunoaffinity purified from bovine tracheal apical membrane vesicles, is sensitive to phosphorylation by Ca2+/calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMK II). The channel protein, which migrates with an M(r) of 140,000 under nonreducing conditions, is phosphorylated in vitro by CaMK II in a Ca(2+)- and calmodulin-dependent manner. When reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, the protein behaves as an anion-selective, 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene- and dithiothreitol-sensitive channel. The open probability of this channel is significantly increased by Ca2+ alone but only at levels of Ca2+ (5-10 microM) that lie outside the physiological range. Addition of CaMK II to the presumptive cytoplasmic side of the bilayer in the presence of ATP and calmodulin dramatically increased the sensitivity of the channel to free Ca2+, shifting the dose-response curve for Ca(2+)-dependent channel activation to lower [Ca2+]i, the maximum increase in channel Po occurring between 0.6 and 1 microM. The addition of kinase in the absence of ATP or calmodulin or the addition of ATP or calmodulin in the absence of kinase was without effect on channel Po. Increasing [Ca2+] above 1 microM decreased channel mean current, causing a flickery block that was maximal at 2 microM. Increasing [Ca2+] as high as 10 microM in the presence of kinase did not further alter channel behavior. In contrast to CaMK II, the addition of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A either alone or together with ATP had no effect on channel Po. These observations suggest that a novel Ca(2+)-sensitive anion channel isolated from bovine airway epithelium is regulated by CaMK II phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1550275690,"We report the identification of a new locus, designated cobC, involved in the assembly of the nucleotide loop of cobalamin in Salmonella typhimurium. The cobC gene has been mapped, cloned, and sequenced. DNA sequence analysis suggested that cobC is divergently transcribed from the adjacent cobD gene and suggests that the regulatory region of these genes overlap. The cobC gene codes for a predicted polypeptide of 26 kDa with striking homology to phosphoglycerate mutase, fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, and acid phosphatase enzymes. In vitro experiments demonstrated that CobC dephosphorylated the cobalamin biosynthetic intermediate N1-(5-phospho-alpha-D-ribosyl)-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole to generate N1-alpha-D-ribosyl-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole. In vivo data showed that the lack of cobC function blocks the synthesis of cobalamin from its precursors cobinamide and 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole, i.e. it prevents the assembly of the nucleotide loop of cobalamin. Additionally, exogenous N1-alpha-D-ribosyl-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole rescues the defect of a cobC mutant. We propose that cobC codes for a novel phosphatase whose primary role is in cobalamin biosynthesis. A model for the sequence of biosynthetic steps that assemble the nucleotide loop of cobalamin in S. typhimurium is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1566221754,"Like several other ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, the yeast cell cycle enzyme CDC34 (UBC3) has a carboxyl-terminal extension or tail. These tails appear to carry out unique functions that can vary from one ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to the next. Using biophysical techniques we have determined that the tail of CDC34 constitutes a highly structured and extended domain. Although the tail of CDC34 is the largest tail identified to date (125 residues), we have found that only 39 residues lying adjacent to the catalytic domain are necessary and sufficient for full cell cycle function and that this region fulfills a novel function that may be common to the tails of other ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Cross-linking studies demonstrate that this region facilitates a physical interaction between CDC34 monomers in vitro. Furthermore, phenotypic analysis of various CDC34 derivatives expressed in different cdc34 mutant strains indicates that this region facilitates the same interaction in vivo. Based on these findings, it appears that the cell cycle function of CDC34 is dependent upon the ability of CDC34 monomers to interact with one another and that this interaction is mediated by a small region of the CDC34 tail. The similarity of this region with sequences contained within the tails of the UBC1 and UBC6 enzymes suggests that these tails may function in a similar manner."
https://openalex.org/W1502792131,"Tissue factor (TF) is expressed rapidly by human monocytes exposed to bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, or LPS). Transcriptional regulation is mediated by binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers to a kappa B-like site in the TF promoter. Nuclear translocation of cytosolic c-Rel/p65 heterodimers and other members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family requires dissociation and proteolytic degradation of the inhibitor protein, I kappa B alpha. The protease inhibitors N alpha-tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) and N alpha-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) block activation of NF-kappa B/Rel proteins by preventing degradation of I kappa B alpha. To determine if TPCK and TLCK inhibited LPS induction of TF expression, freshly isolated human monocytes and monocytic THP-1 cells were pretreated with these inhibitors for 30 min before LPS stimulation. Both TPCK and TLCK inhibited LPS induction of TF protein, TF mRNA and TF promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. These inhibitors specifically prevented degradation of I kappa B alpha and nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers. In contrast, TPCK and TLCK did not block induction of an immediate-early gene encoding the transcription factor, Egr-1. Taken together, these data indicated that inhibiting nuclear translocation of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers prevented LPS induction of TF gene transcription in monocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1897434666,"Five different chimeric fusion proteins between the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase and the rat kidney alpha 1 isoform of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase were expressed in COS-1 cells and analyzed functionally. In two chimeras, the only Na+,K(+)-ATPase-derived part consisted of the region corresponding to the third transmembrane segment. These proteins phosphorylated from ATP in the presence of a high Ca2+ concentration and from Pi in the absence of Ca2+, but the phosphorylation displayed strongly reduced sensitivity to inhibition by thapsigargin. In two other chimeras, the N-terminal two-thirds of the molecule were derived from Na+,K(+)-ATPase, except the region containing the fourth transmembrane segment. These proteins were unable to phosphorylate from ATP but phosphorylated from Pi, the latter reaction being insensitive to inhibition by thapsigargin. In the last chimera, the N-terminal two-thirds of the molecule were derived from Na+,K(+)-ATPase, except the region corresponding to both the third and the fourth transmembrane segments. This chimera phosphorylated from Pi in the reaction that was fully sensitive to inhibition by thapsigargin. It can be concluded that the third transmembrane segment is indispensable to thapsigargin sensitivity of the Ca(2+)-ATPase and most likely, therefore, constitutes a major binding region for thapsigargin."

The nature of these complexes was investigated using an in vitro translation system programmed with a single mRNA lacking a translational termination codon. Complexes containing nascent polypeptides (molecular mass 700 kDa by gel-filtration analysis. Complexes between the nascent polypeptide and at least hsp 73 appear to be sensitive to (disrupted by) ATP. The presence of ATP also dramatically alters the sensitivity of the nascent polypeptide chains to digestion by exogenous protease. Collectively, our data indicate that there may be a cytoplasmic machinery, including hsp 70, which comprises a nascent polypeptide chain binding complex."
https://openalex.org/W1497452605,"A unique carboxyl proteinase (EC 3.4.23.33), insensitive to the classical inhibitor isovaleryl pepstatin and isolated from Pseudomonas sp. 101 (PCP), is the first example of a prokaryotic enzyme of this class. The gene coding for PCP was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene consists of 1,761 base pairs encoding a protein of 587 amino acid residues. The NH2-terminal 215-amino acid preprosequence flanks the 372-amino acid mature protein, which is identical with the primary structure of an authentic PCP determined by chemical methods. E. coli carrying a plasmid containing the cloned wild-type PCP gene produced a 62-kDa protein. This molecule was processed and secreted into the periplasm as a 43-kDa protein, which converted to mature PCP under acidic conditions. This autocatalytic conversion was completely blocked by tyrostatin, a PCP-specific peptidic inhibitor from Kitasatosporia sp. 55. The purified recombinant PCP has the same characteristics as authentic PCP. When several preprosequence deletion mutants were expressed in E. coli, mutant proteins were accumulated as insoluble forms with no proteinase activities. These results suggest that the prepropeptide of PCP plays an essential role in the formation of functional PCP."
https://openalex.org/W1580588909,"Wild type ricin A chain (RTA) contains two cysteine residues (Cys171 and Cys259). Cys259 forms the interchain disulfide bond of ricin holotoxin with Cys4 of ricin B chain (RTB). We have used site-directed mutagenesis of RTA cDNA to convert Cys171 to Ser and to introduce a disulfide bond into RTA by converting Ser215 and Met255 to Cys residues. Mutant RTA was expressed in Escherichia coli and directed to the oxidizing environment of the periplasmic space where the Cys215-Cys255 disulfide bond was formed. The disulfide-containing RTA mutant had an in vitro catalytic activity similar to that of an identical form of recombinant RTA that lacked the S215C and M255C mutations. In the presence of glutathione and protein disulfide isomerase, this RTA variant reassociated with RTB to form ricin holotoxin. Incubation of this holotoxin with increasing concentrations of dithiothreitol showed that the interchain disulfide bond joining RTA and RTB was more readily reduced than the intrachain disulfide bond in RTA. Ricin in which the RTA moiety contained the disulfide bond was 15-18-fold less cytotoxic to HeLa or Vero cells than ricin in which the RTA did not contain the stabilizing disulfide cross-link. Since these ricin molecules had identical RTB cell binding and RTA catalytic activities, we suggest that the observed reduction in cytotoxicity caused by the introduced disulfide bond resulted from a constraint on the unfolding of RTA, indicating that such unfolding is necessary for the membrane translocation of RTA during its entry into the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1606205321,Infection of Escherichia coli by bacteriophage T4 induces a mRNA ribonuclease activity that shows specificity for cleavage within the sequence GGAG. Substrates of the activity in vivo include a number of phage mRNAs that are cleaved at GGAGs within the Shine/Dalgarno domains of their translation initiation regions. Induction of the ribonuclease depends on the product of the T4 gene regB. We describe here the overproduction and extensive purification of the RegB protein. RegB precisely co-purifies with an activity that cleaves within the sequence GGAG in oligonucleotide and polynucleotide RNAs and is therefore likely to constitute the sequence-specific catalytic component of the observed activity. We further report that the low cleavage rate observed with our preparations of purified RegB is substantially increased (1-2 orders of magnitude) by the addition of E. coli ribosomal protein S1. We discuss the implications of this observation for the mechanism of action of the RegB ribonuclease in vitro and in vivo.
https://openalex.org/W1858907820,"A cDNA encoding full-length carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) from rat liver was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a system devoid of endogenous CPT activity. The recombinant enzyme was of the expected size (as deduced from immunoblots), membrane-bound, and detergent-labile. It was also potently inhibited by malonyl-CoA, with an I50 value (concentration causing 50% inhibition) of approximately 5 microM, similar to that of the native enzyme in rat liver mitochondria. A truncated variant of the enzyme that lacked the amino-terminal 82 residues encompassing the first hydrophobic domain retained catalytic function but was much less sensitive to malonyl-CoA (I50 > 80 microM). Deletion of the cDNA segment encoding amino acids 31-148 (which includes both first and second hydrophobic stretches) resulted in no detectable product. The data establish unequivocally that a single polypeptide possesses both catalytic and malonyl-CoA binding domains, as well as the other properties previously attributed by us to native CPT I in mammalian mitochondria, and should thus put to rest the controversy surrounding this issue (Kerner, J., Zaluzec, E., Gage, D., and Bieber, L. L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 8209-8219). In addition, the results strengthen the view that one site of interaction of malonyl-CoA with the rat liver enzyme involves the NH2-terminal region of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1526895541,"In an effort to facilitate the structural and biochemical analyses of the Ah receptor (AHR) and the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), a baculovirus system was developed to express microgram-milligram quantities of the human version of these proteins. To simplify purification, a polyhistidine tag was cloned at their C termini so that the recombinant proteins could be specifically adsorbed to nickel-nitriloacetic acid-Sepharose. Expression studies revealed that approximately 23% of the overexpressed AHR was recovered in cell extracts with the remaining 77% forming insoluble aggregates. ARNT was found to be more soluble, with 90% recovery from cell extracts and only 10% aggregation. Photoaffinity labeling and gel shift assays demonstrated that the recombinant proteins bound ligand, heterodimerized, and recognized their cognate dioxin response element (DRE) in a manner similar to their native counterparts. Coexpression of the AHR and ARNT in Sf9 cells resulted in the in vivo generation of heterodimers that bound the DRE in the absence of ligand. Studies with the nickel-nitriloacetic acid-purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that the AHR and ARNT could bind DRE only when reconstituted with a heat-sensitive factor(s) present in soluble extracts from a variety of cell types. Use of these proteins also demonstrated the existence of at least three AHR-dependent DRE-binding species, suggesting that the AHR can bind to DRE in at least three distinct conformations."
https://openalex.org/W1611135806,"Regenerating liver is a physiologic animal system in which p50/p65 nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) DNA binding activity is induced and rapidly disappears in the remnant liver within minutes of partial hepatectomy. The activation of NF-kappa B may contribute to the mechanism by which hepatocytes regulate their mitogenic program during liver regeneration. A p50/NF-kappa B1-p35/RelA heterodimer that contains a proteolyzed amino-terminal DNA binding fragment of p65/RelA is also present in the nuclei of hepatic cells within minutes of partial hepatectomy. In the absence of I kappa B-alpha resynthesis, turnover of NF-kappa B occurs via conversion of p50/NF-kappa B1-p65/RelA to a p50/NF-kappa B1-p35/RelA DNA binding complex. Proteolytic conversion of p65/RelA into p35/RelA and subsequent degradation of p35/RelA account at least in part for the rapid turnover of NF-kappa B in the cell nuclei. Nuclear proteolysis provides a potential mechanism for tightly regulating the level of active NF-kappa B."
https://openalex.org/W1599828312,Chloroplast mRNAs in Euglena gracilis fall into two classes. One class has a Shine-Dalgarno sequence 5' to the AUG start codon while the other group of mRNAs does not have any conserved sequence elements near the start codon. The chloroplast mRNA encoding the atpH gene has been selected as an example of a message which has a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (GGAGUU) located in the initiation region. Mutations in the Shine-Dalgarno sequence result in 2-5-fold reductions in the efficiency of the message in initiation complex formation depending on the precise mutation. Secondary structure mapping of the initiation region of the atpH mRNA suggests that a number of mRNA conformations are present in an equilibrium mixture. Mutations in the Shine-Dalgarno sequence had little effect on the overall structure of the mRNA. Directed mutations which place the Shine-Dalgarno sequence into a region of higher secondary structure drastically reduce the activity of the message. The monocistronic form of the atpH mRNA has a 5'-untranslated leader region slightly over 70 nucleotides in length. Deletions in the leader suggest that a minimum length of 10 bases 5' to the start codon is important for activity in initiation. The presence of the full leader increased efficiency in initiation about 2-fold compared to messages with leaders 25-40 residues in length.
https://openalex.org/W1495274965,"Abstract The RuvA and RuvB proteins of Escherichia coli promote the branch migration of Holliday junctions in vitro. To understand the relationship between branch migration and the intrinsic 5'-->3' DNA helicase activity of RuvAB, the requirements and substrate specificity of the helicase reaction have been studied in more detail. We find that RuvAB-mediated DNA unwinding and branch migration reactions show similar requirements for Mg2+ and ATP and are inhibited to a similar extent by ADP and ATP gamma S (adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)). The helicase activity, measured by the dissociation of a short fragment from circular single-stranded DNA, requires both RuvA and RuvB and is stimulated by subsaturating concentrations of single-strand binding protein (SSB). In contrast, saturating concentrations of SSB are inhibitory. Using substrates that contain a DNA junction, which permits the specific binding of RuvA, we find that the RuvA and RuvB proteins promote two types of helicase reactions: nonspecific reactions, which are sensitive to inhibition by stoichiometric amounts of SSB, and junction-targeted reactions, which are not inhibited by SSB. Using three-armed structures, we observe that junction-targeted reactions display a polarity and result in asymmetric product formation. Junction-specific binding and the subsequent initiation of DNA unwinding are likely to represent early steps in the process of branch migration."
https://openalex.org/W1576125383,"It has been suggested (Kini, R. R., and Evans, H. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14402-14407) that the anticoagulant activity of members of the 14-kDa phospholipase A2 (PLA2) family depends on the presence of basic residues within a variable surface region (residues 54-77) distinct from both the conserved catalytic machinery and surface sites mediating the antibacterial action of these enzymes (see Weiss, J., Inada, M., Elsbach, P., and Crowl, R. M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 26331-26337). To further define the determinants of the anticoagulant activity of PLA2, we have analyzed the inhibitory effects of purified native and recombinant PLA2 on cell-free prothrombinase. Both native and recombinant wild-type pig pancreas (net charge -1) and human secretory PLA2 (net charge +15) produced similar dose-dependent inhibition of prothrombinase activity that was significantly less potent than a toxic PLA2 purified from snake venom. Site-specific mutations that either increased or decreased PLA2 activity toward bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein-treated Escherichia coli by up to 50-fold had no effect on antiprothrombinase activity. In contrast, substitution of Arg for Asp-59/Gly for Ser-60 in the pig PLA2 increased antiprothrombinase activity by 5-10-fold without affecting catalytic activity toward a range of phospholipid substrates or antibacterial activity. Comparison of antiprothrombinase activity of catalytically active and inactive forms of the PLA2 and under a range of phospholipid conditions revealed that the potent antiprothrombinase activity of native toxic venom PLA2 and of the D59R.S60G mutant pancreatic PLA2 reflect combined catalytic and noncatalytic actions, the latter apparently dependent on basic residues at discrete surface sites in the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1513878541,"We have used two experimental approaches to examine the possible role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in the regulation of glucose transport in oocytes isolated from Xenopus laevis. Incubation of oocytes with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin inhibited insulin-like growth factor-1-stimulated deoxyglucose uptake. Half-maximal inhibition was observed at concentrations approximately 20 nM. Conversely, we also examined the effects of microinjection of synthetic peptides designed to interact with Src homology 2 domains of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase on deoxyglucose transport in oocytes. We show that a bifunctional synthetic peptide containing two YMXM consensus sequences for binding to SH2 domains stimulated both PI 3-kinase activity and deoxyglucose transport when both tyrosine residues were phosphorylated. However, non-phosphorylated or bisphosphonotyrosine peptides with the identical amino acid sequence failed to stimulate transport or PI 3-kinase activity. Taken together, these data argue strongly for a role for PI 3-kinase in the regulation of glucose transport in oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1669900798,"Substrate channeling is a process by which two sequential enzymes interact to transfer a metabolite (or intermediate) from one enzyme active site to the next without allowing free diffusion of the metabolite. Channeling is thought to play an important role in metabolic regulation and cellular modulation of enzymatic activities. Although there are numerous examples of sequential enzyme pairs in glycolysis and other biosynthetic pathways that are thought to exhibit channeling, this is as yet controversial. Tryptophan synthase is considered the best example for an enzyme displaying channeling behavior between subunits. Tryptophan synthase is an alpha 2 beta 2 tetrameric enzyme complex, which catalyzes the last two steps in the biosynthesis of L-tryptophan. The alpha subunit catalyzes the cleavage of indole-3-glycerol phosphate to indole and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; the beta subunit catalyzes the condensation of indole with serine to form tryptophan, in a reaction mediated by pyridoxal phosphate. The inability to trap free indole in the steady-state reaction and analysis of the kinetics of single turnover reactions have led to the postulate that indole may pass directly from the alpha to the beta site without diffusion through solution (Demoss, J. A. (1962) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 62, 279-293; Matchett, W. M. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 4041-4049). The crystal structure of tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium has provided additional support for substrate channeling by elucidating a 25-A hydrophobic tunnel connecting the two catalytic sites (Hyde, C. C., Ahmed, S. A., Padlan, E. A., Miles, E. W., and Davies, D. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 17857-17871). The structure suggests that mutation of a residue lining the tunnel to a more bulky residue might impede or block the passage of indole during catalysis thus enabling detection of indole during a single enzyme turnover. A mutant of tryptophan synthase has been prepared in which one of the residues lining the tunnel, beta Cys-170, has been replaced with a bulkier tryptophan residue. Kinetic and structural analyses of the beta C170W mutant by rapid chemical quench methods and x-ray crystallographic analysis show both the transient formation of indole and the obstruction of the tunnel, thus providing direct evidence for the substrate channeling mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1543820595,"The invariant chain is a membrane protein associated with the major histocompatibility complex class II antigens both intra- and extracellularly. The extracellular portion of the human invariant chain (Ii) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with a polyhistidine tail and purified by metal affinity chromatography. The recombinant Ii was used as a ligand to probe binding to the cell surface of Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with human class II alpha and beta genes of the DR4 isotype. We show that recombinant Ii inhibits peptide loading on class II polypeptides and also the converse; the presence of peptide in the antigen groove prevents binding of fluorescein-conjugated Ii. Moreover, blocking of Ii binding by peptide did not require a transition of the class II dimers to an SDS-stable state. A monoclonal antibody, L243, known to bind to (or close to) the peptide pocket of the class II molecule likewise blocked Ii-fluorescein binding. Further, we investigated whether or not the Ii, a variety of bacterial superantigens or the CD4 molecule, have overlapping binding sites on the class II heterodimer. Of the class II ligands tested, reduced binding was detected for the Staphylococcus superantigen type SEB on cells precincubated with soluble Ii while the binding of the other ligands was either unchanged or marginally changed. These data clarify by a direct biochemical approach the binding characteristics of Ii in comparison with other class II ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1562371023,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves as an excellent model for the study of the structure and function of proteins. Numerous amino acid substitutions in the proteolipid subunit of yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase have been reported. Suppressed variants for several of the inactive mutants were selected after subjecting them to chemical or polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and screening for second site suppressors. Suppressors for the mutation Gln90 to Lys change were intragenic and resulted from the changes: Ala14 to Val, Val74 to Ile, Ile89 to Leu, and Ile89 to Met. These residues are found on three different transmembrane segments but presumably at the same surface of the membrane. A new inactive proteolipid mutation was constructed by changing Val138 to Leu. This residue is situated in the middle of the fourth transmembrane segment, neighboring Glu137 which is the potential dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding site. The intragenic suppressor mutations for the above amino acid replacement resulted in changes of Val55 to Ala, Met59 to Val, or Ile130 to Thr. These residues are found in the second and fourth transmembrane segments, presumably on the same interface. It seems as if all those internal suppressor mutations compensate for the volume changes caused by the original displacement of the given amino acid. Five glycine residues, situated on the same face of the third transmembrane helix, were changed to valine and all these mutants were inactive. A suppressor mutation to one of those mutants (Gly101 to Val) was identified as substitution of Ile134 to Val. The structural and functional implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1573631680,"5-Lipoxygenase is the first committed enzyme in the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway and is known to catalyze not only the first oxygenation of arachidonate to form 5(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5(S)-HPETE), but also dehydration of this intermediate into leukotriene A4 (LTA4) by an activity termed leukotriene A4 synthase. Inhibition of cytosolic 5-lipoxygenase prepared from human blood granulocytes with zileuton (100 microM) was virtually complete, but LTA4 synthase activity was only inhibited by 47%. Structural characterization of eicosanoids synthesized in these preparations revealed an abundance of 15-lipoxygenase metabolites including 15-HETE when arachidonate was used as substrate and 5(S),15(S)-dihydroxy-6,8,11,13(E,E,Z,Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid when 5(S)-HPETE was used as substrate. When neutrophils were prepared that contained less than 1% eosinophil contamination, zileuton was found to almost completely inhibit all 5-lipoxygenase, as well as LTA4 synthase products. Immunochemical analysis of the supernatants from purified neutrophils and eosinophils confirmed the previous observation that neutrophils do not express 15-lipoxygenase. Incubation of 5(S)-HPETE with recombinant mammalian 15-lipoxygenase resulted in the formation of 6-trans-LTB4 and 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 as LTA4 products, as well as the 12-lipoxygenase product 5(S),12(S)-diHPETE. The mechanism of action of 15-lipoxygenase acting as an LTA4 synthase is proposed to involve removing the pro-R hydrogen atom at carbon-10 of 5(S)-HPETE, which is antarafacial to the hydroperoxy group to yield LTA4."
https://openalex.org/W1615838532,"Heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2) is the predominant form of heme oxygenase in the brain and testes. The enzyme is not readily amenable to isolation from mammalian tissues and has not been characterized for its kinetic properties and interaction with metalloporphyrins. Presently a rat HO-2 cDNA (Rotenberg, M.O., and Maines, M. D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7501-7506) was used to generate a construct with a neutral hydrophobicity profile at its COOH terminus for expression of nearly full-length HO-2 protein in Escherichia coli. The procedures used for HO-1 were of no utility in purification of HO-2. A multistep protocol developed for isolation of HO-2 resulted in a homogeneous protein with a specific activity up to 6,500 nmol of bilirubin/mg/h. Based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses, the protein had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 34 kDa. HO-2 binds Fe-protoporphyrin (heme) at near molar unity to give a complex with the absorption maximum at 403 nm. The Soret band has a blue shift to 430 nm when heme iron is reduced, with distinct alpha and beta bands at 485 and 550 nm, respectively. The Soret band of the CO complex of ferrous heme.HO-2 is at 420 nm, and alpha and beta bands are at 540 and 572 nm, respectively. The apparent Km for Fe-protoporphyrin is 0.33 microM, with a Vmax of 0.45 nmol of bilirubin/mg/h. Zn-protoporphyrin is a strong mixed inhibitor of enzyme activity, whereas Co-protoporphyrin is a poor competitive inhibitor of activity. When HO-2 was preincubated (10 min at 4 degrees C) with Fe-protoporphyrin, the cobalt complex did not inhibit enzyme activity, whereas the Zn-protoporphyrin effectively inhibited activity. Calorimetric measurements suggest that HO-2/heme interaction involves one type of association producing a single heat absorption peak upon melting of the complex and that the unfolding is not reversible. The association increases the enthalpy of HO-2 (130 kcal/mol versus 184 kcal/mol) and increases the stability to heat denaturation by 9 degrees C. Heat duration of zinc complex involves at least two stages of unfolding."
https://openalex.org/W1637128282,"The goal of this work is to identify those elements which control gene expression in the parasitic protozoan, Leishmania enriettii. To date there has been no report of a transcriptional controlling element identified in this parasite. In the present study, we have found that a region of the lemdr1 locus of L. enriettii can down-regulate the steady state mRNA level of the reporter neomycin phosphotransferase gene when it is placed in an extrachromosomal expression vector, pALTneo. Through deletion analysis, we have mapped a putative regulatory sequence to the flanking region upstream of the lemdr1 gene. This cis regulatory element is shown to control gene expression in an orientation-dependent and position independent manner. By performing nuclear run-on analysis, we have demonstrated that this element mainly exerts its effect at the transcriptional level by determining the strandedness of transcription on the pALTneo vector. The identification of this novel cis regulatory element should further our understanding of the transcriptional process in Leishmania and other related trypanosomatids."

Control of expression of this gene is regulated by a well characterized 3' enhancer together with a promoter and upstream elements. The CD2 promoter is typical of a group of T cell-specific promoters that lack a TATA and use multiple sites for initiation of transcription. An box motif CACGTG, located just upstream from the most 5' initiation start site, was found to contribute a major effect to the level of basal transcription of a reporter gene. Analysis of the proteins in T cell extracts that bound to this site revealed that the bHLH-LZ protein USF was the major component. A functional role for USF was established in transient transfection experiments. Thus, this protein restored full promoter activity following repression caused by cotransfection with the E binding bHLH-LZ protein Max. Taken together, these results indicate that an E motif is critical to expression of the CD2 gene during T cell development and that the HLH protein USF acts as a transcriptional activator of the CD2 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1556883117,"The asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) receptor undergoes constitutive endocytosis in HepG2 cells, which is regulated by tyrosine kinase activity (Fallon, R. J., Danaher, M., Saylors, R. L., and Saxena, A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 11011-11017). In this study we show that the receptor copurifies with a tyrosine kinase activity, as defined by tyrosine phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate (reduced carboxyamidomethylated and maleylated lysozyme). Analysis of cells transfected with one subunit of the ASGP receptor showed that signals in the cytoplasmic domain of the H1 subunit are sufficient for receptor kinase association. In addition, receptor kinase association is not dependent on the single cytoplasmic tyrosine at position 5. Analysis of the components of anti-ASGP receptor immunoprecipitates revealed the presence of a 127-kDa protein (p127), which becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine upon addition of gamma-[32P]ATP and which is capable of binding ATP.p127 was also demonstrated in anti-transferrin receptor immunoprecipitates but not in immunoprecipitates of a resident membrane protein, human HLA. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that the ASGP receptor, a protein that participates in constitutive, rapid endocytosis, is associated with a cellular tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1602082099,"Phosphatidate (PA) is synthesized by a variety of cells in response to physiological agonists. Addition of PA vesicles to [3H]arachidonic acid (AA)-labeled macrophages was found to induce the release of radiolabel in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This effect correlated with the uptake of PA by the macrophages and appeared to be attributable to PA itself and not to a PA metabolite. In parallel with AA release, PA induced a rapid increase in lysophosphatidylcholine in cells prelabeled with [14C]glycerol. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by long term exposure of the cells to phorbol myristate acetate or cell treatment with the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine did not affect the PA response. Also, removal of external calcium or cell treatment with the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine did not affect PA-induced AA release, while inhibiting the responses to zymosan, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and ionophore A23187. PA-induced AA release was not affected by intracellular calcium depletion by treatment with quin2/AM in the presence of EGTA. When assayed toward an AA-containing substrate, PA was able to enhance phospholipase A2 activity from cell homogenates in the absence of calcium. The dose dependence and magnitude of the PA effect correlated with those observed for PA-induced AA release in whole cells. Inclusion of ATP in the assay mixture did not affect the activity of the PA-stimulated phospholipase A2. These findings suggest a role for PA in the cascade of events leading to AA release in macrophages through Ca(2+)-independent stimulation of an AA-selective phospholipase A2."
https://openalex.org/W1526583779,"A protein toxin, termed peditoxin, containing an active prosthetic group was isolated and purified from the globiferous pedicellariae of the sea urchin Toxopneustes pileolus (Lamarck). The prosthetic group, called pedoxin, is a small molecular mass substance (206 daltons) with an empirical formula of C10H10N2O3 and is comprised of a heterocyclic lactone structure formed from pyridoxal and glycine. Administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly to mice in sublethal doses, pedoxin markedly reduced basal body temperature and led to sedation and anesthetic coma accompanied by muscular relaxation. At higher doses, it leads to convulsion and death (LD50 200 mg/kg). The apoprotein, a cytochrome b-like heme protein called pedin (molecular mass, 10,000 daltons) is itself not toxic, but the purified holoprotein is extremely toxic, causing anaphylaxis-like shock and death in experimental animals at low doses (LD50 70 micrograms/kg). Small amounts of the prosthetic group added to holoprotein preparations caused the toxicity to be greatly enhanced, suggesting that holoprotein preparations also contain apoprotein capable of being activated by the low molecular weight toxin. The structure of pedoxin was determined to be 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-methoxy-4-pyridineformyl-glycyliden ester and was confirmed by total synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1574729488,"Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to analyze alterations in nuclear free calcium (Ca2+n) levels induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms in BALB/c3T3 fibroblasts loaded with the calcium-sensitive fluorescent indicator Fluo-3. Both AA-PDGF and BB-PDGF caused a transient increase in Ca2+n. Analysis of PDGF-induced Ca2+n alterations as a function of time revealed that BB-PDGF stimulation resulted in the generation of Ca2+n oscillations that diminished over time. The frequency of BB-PDGF-stimulated oscillations was modulated by extracellular Ca2+ and could not be mimicked by increasing intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels in the absence of growth factor stimulation. Caffeine alone had no effect on Ca2+n levels, but exposure of cells to caffeine after BB-PDGF stimulation augmented Ca2+n oscillations, either by increasing the frequency or reinitiating preexisting oscillations. The genesis of these oscillations in Ca2+n appears to be in the region just outside of the nucleus, as perinuclear cytoplasmic free calcium (Ca2+i) increased just prior to Ca2+n. In contrast, AA-PDGF stimulation resulted in the generation of one or two irregular, transient Ca2+n spikes. Caffeine pretreatment followed by AA-PDGF stimulation resulted in Ca2+n oscillations very similar to those produced by BB-PDGF alone. Additionally, the AA-PDGF and BB-PDGF isoforms appeared to modulate distinct pools of cellular Ca2+, as BB-PDGF was still capable of inducing Ca2+n oscillations subsequent to prior induction of oscillations by AA-PDGF/caffeine. These PDGF isoform-specific changes in nuclear free Ca2+ could serve as a mechanism by which isoform-specific cellular signaling pathways may be manifested by the growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1498761100,"The model for translational initiation predicts that eukaryotic mRNAs should, as a rule, be monocistronic. However, cases have recently been described of eukaryotic mRNAs producing more than one protein through alternative translational initiation at several different AUG codons. The present work reports the occurrence of multiple translational start sites on the mRNA of the Neurospora crassa gene albino-3 (al-3), encoding the carotenoid biosynthetic enzyme geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate synthase. This was revealed by the molecular analysis of an al-3 mutant carrying a deletion within the coding sequence, which was expected to prevent the synthesis of a functional geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate synthase because of ribosome frameshifting and premature translational termination. However, the mutants could maintain appreciable geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate synthase activity through a mechanism operating at the translational level, whereby a fraction of ribosomes initiated protein synthesis from either of two internal in-frame AUG codons located downstream of the deletion, thus producing a shortened but still active version of the geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate synthase. The results presented indicate that the internal AUG codons are recognized mainly or solely by direct ribosome binding rather than by leaky scanning from the 5' end of the mRNA."
