https://openalex.org/W2135107819,"Inductive signals and transcription factors involved in motor neuron generation have been identified, raising the question of whether these developmental insights can be used to direct stem cells to a motor neuron fate. We show that developmentally relevant signaling factors can induce mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to differentiate into spinal progenitor cells, and subsequently into motor neurons, through a pathway recapitulating that used in vivo. ES cell-derived motor neurons can populate the embryonic spinal cord, extend axons, and form synapses with target muscles. Thus, inductive signals involved in normal pathways of neurogenesis can direct ES cells to form specific classes of CNS neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2057772007,"During photosynthesis, plants must control the utilization of light energy in order to avoid photoinhibition. We isolated an Arabidopsis mutant, pgr5 (proton gradient regulation), in which downregulation of photosystem II photochemistry in response to intense light was impaired. PGR5 encodes a novel thylakoid membrane protein that is involved in the transfer of electrons from ferredoxin to plastoquinone. This alternative electron transfer pathway, whose molecular identity has long been unclear, is known to function in vivo in cyclic electron flow around photosystem I. We propose that the PGR5 pathway contributes to the generation of a Delta(pH) that induces thermal dissipation when Calvin cycle activity is reduced. Under these conditions, the PGR5 pathway also functions to limit the overreduction of the acceptor side of photosystem I, thus preventing photosystem I photoinhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2016402044,"The marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi possesses two quorum sensing systems (System 1 and System 2) that regulate bioluminescence. Although the Vibrio cholerae genome sequence reveals that a V. harveyi-like System 2 exists, it does not predict the existence of a V. harveyi-like System 1 or any obvious quorum sensing-controlled target genes. In this report we identify and characterize the genes encoding an additional V. cholerae autoinducer synthase and its cognate sensor. Analysis of double mutants indicates that a third as yet unidentified sensory circuit exists in V. cholerae. This quorum sensing apparatus is unusually complex, as it is composed of at least three parallel signaling channels. We show that in V. cholerae these communication systems converge to control virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2120191560,"Discovered over a decade ago, white-opaque switching in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans is an alternation between two quasistable, heritable transcriptional states. Here, we show that white-opaque switching and sexual mating are both controlled by mating type locus homeodomain proteins and that opaque cells mate approximately 10(6) times more efficiently than do white cells. These results show that opaque cells are a mating-competent form of C. albicans and that this pathogen undergoes a white-to-opaque switch as a critical step in the mating process. As white cells are generally more robust in a mammalian host than are opaque cells, this strategy allows the organism to survive the rigors of life within a mammalian host, yet generate mating-competent cells."
https://openalex.org/W2024969918,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) promote the proliferation of multiple myeloma (MM) cells and protect them against dexamethasone (Dex)-induced apoptosis. We have previously shown that Apo2 ligand/TNF-Related apoptosis inducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL) induces apoptosis of MM cells, including cells either sensitive or resistant to Dex and cytotoxic drugs, and overcomes the growth and survival effect of IL-6; conversely, NF-kappaB transcriptional activity attenuates their Apo2L/TRAIL-sensitivity. In the current study, we demonstrate that IGF-1 stimulates sustained activation of NF-kappaB and Akt; induces phosphorylation of the FKHRL-1 Forkhead transcription factor; upregulates a series of intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins including FLIP, survivin, cIAP-2, A1/Bfl-1, and XIAP; and decreases Apo2L/TRAIL-sensitivity of MM cells. In contrast, IL-6 does not cause sustained NF-kappaB activation, induces less pronounced Akt activation and FKHRL-1 phosphorylation than IGF-1, and increases the expression of only survivin. Forced overexpression of constitutively active Akt in MM-1S cells reduced their sensitivity to Apo2L/TRAIL and to doxorubicin (Doxo). In contrast, the Akt inhibitor IL-6-Hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate induced cell death of both Dex- and Doxo-sensitive and -resistant cells; opposed the protective effect of constitutive Akt activity against Apo2L/TRAIL; and abrogated the NF-kappaB activation, increase of anti-apoptotic proteins and protection against Apo2L/TRAIL induced by IGF-1. These findings therefore define an important role of the Akt pathway in modulating tumor cell responsiveness to Apo2L/TRAIL, delineate molecular mechanisms for the survival effects of IGF-1, and characterize differential pathophysiologic sequelae of IGF-1 vs IL-6 on MM cells. Importantly, they provide the basis for future clinical trials in MM combining conventional or novel agents with strategies designed to neutralize IGF-1."
https://openalex.org/W1999355295,"Retrotransposons have shaped eukaryotic genomes for millions of years. To analyze the consequences of human L1 retrotransposition, we developed a genetic system to recover many new L1 insertions in somatic cells. Forty-two de novo integrants were recovered that faithfully mimic many aspects of L1s that accumulated since the primate radiation. Their structures experimentally demonstrate an association between L1 retrotransposition and various forms of genetic instability. Numerous L1 element inversions, extra nucleotide insertions, exon deletions, a chromosomal inversion, and flanking sequence comobilization (called 5' transduction) were identified. In a striking number of integrants, short identical sequences were shared between the donor and the target site's 3' end, suggesting a mechanistic model that helps explain the structure of L1 insertions."
https://openalex.org/W2002190096,"LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition continues to impact the human genome, yet little is known about how L1 integrates into DNA. Here, we developed a plasmid-based rescue system and have used it to recover 37 new L1 retrotransposition events from cultured human cells. Sequencing of the insertions revealed the usual L1 structural hallmarks; however, in four instances, retrotransposition generated large target site deletions. Remarkably, three of those resulted in the formation of chimeric L1s, containing the 5' end of an endogenous L1 fused precisely to our engineered L1. Thus, our data demonstrate multiple pathways for L1 integration in cultured cells, and show that L1 is not simply an insertional mutagen, but that its retrotransposition can result in significant deletions of genomic sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1966805460,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a common myopathy, is an autosomal dominant disease of unknown molecular mechanism. Almost all FSHD patients carry deletions of an integral number of tandem 3.3 kilobase repeats, termed D4Z4, located on chromosome 4q35. Here, we find that in FSHD muscle, 4q35 genes located upstream of D4Z4 are inappropriately overexpressed. We show that an element within D4Z4 specifically binds a multiprotein complex consisting of YY1, a known transcriptional repressor, HMGB2, an architectural protein, and nucleolin. We demonstrate that this multiprotein complex binds D4Z4 in vitro and in vivo and mediates transcriptional repression of 4q35 genes. Based upon these results, we propose that deletion of D4Z4 leads to the inappropriate transcriptional derepression of 4q35 genes resulting in disease."
https://openalex.org/W2139485237,"Spinal cord oligodendrocytes originate in the ventricular zone and subsequently migrate to white matter, stop, proliferate, and differentiate. Here we demonstrate a role for the chemokine CXCL1 and its receptor CXCR2 in patterning the developing spinal cord. Signaling through CXCR2, CXCL1 inhibited oligodendrocyte precursor migration. The migrational arrest was rapid, reversible, concentration dependent, and reflected enhanced cell/substrate interactions. White matter expression of CXCL1 was temporo-spatially regulated. Developing CXCR2 null spinal cords contained reduced oligodendrocytes, abnormally concentrated at the periphery. In slice preparations, CXCL1 inhibited embryonic oligodendrocyte precursor migration, and widespread dispersal of postnatal precursors occurred in the absence of CXCR2 signaling. These data suggest that population of presumptive white matter by oligodendrocyte precursors is dependent on localized expression of CXCL1."

https://openalex.org/W2313786846,"Short 21-mer double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules have recently been employed for the sequence-specific silencing of endogenous human genes. This mechanism, called RNA interference (RNAi), is extremely potent and requires only a few dsRNA molecules per cell to silence homologous gene mRNA expression. We used dsRNA targeting the M-BCR/ABL fusion site to kill leukemic cells with such a rearrangement. Transfection of dsRNA specific for the M-BCR/ABL fusion mRNA into K562 cells depleted the corresponding mRNA and the M-BCR/ABL oncoprotein. This was demonstrated by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blots. The BCR/ABL knockdown was accompanied by strong induction of apoptotic cell death. Leukemic cells without BCR/ABL rearrangement were not killed by M-BCR/ABL-dsRNA. In addition, to corroborate the extraordinary sequence specificity of RNAi, we designed another RNA oligo matching the M-BCR/ABL fusion site but having two point mutations within its central region. We show that these two point mutations abolished both p210 reduction and induction of apoptosis in K562 cells. Finally, we compared leukemic cell killing by RNAi to that caused by the ABL kinase tyrosine inhibitor, STI 571, Imatinib. For full induction of apoptosis, dsRNA targeting M-BCR/ABL required 24 h more than Imatinib. This may be caused by the relatively long half-life of the BCR/ABL oncoprotein, which is not targeted by the RNAi mechanism, but is affected by STI 571. When we applied ds M-BCR/ABL RNA and STI 571 in combination, we did not observe a further increase in the induction of apoptosis. Nevertheless, these data may open a field for further studies towards gene-therapeutic approaches using RNA interference to kill tumor cells with specific genetic abnormalities."

https://openalex.org/W2062736188,"No clear patterns in molecular changes underlying the malignant processes in lung cancer of different histological types have been found so far. To identify critical genes in lung cancer progression we compared the expression profile of cancer related genes in 14 pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients with normal lung tissue by using the cDNA array technique. Principal component analyses (PCA) and permutation test were used to detect the differentially expressed genes. The expression profiles of 10 genes were confirmed by semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR. In tumour samples, as compared to normal lung tissue, the up-regulated genes included such known tumour markers as CCNB1, PLK, tenascin, KRT8, KRT19 and TOP2A. The down-regulated genes included caveolin 1 and 2, and TIMP3. We also describe, for the first time, down-regulation of the interesting SOCS2 and 3, DOC2 and gravin. We show that silencing of SOCS2 is not caused by methylation of exon 1 of the gene. In conclusion, by using the cDNA array technique we were able to reveal marked differences in the gene expression level between normal lung and tumour tissue and find possible new tumour markers for pulmonary adenocarcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W2315471026,"TGFbeta inducible early gene (TIEG) encodes a three zinc-finger Krüppel-like transcription factor whose overexpression has been shown to mimic the effects of TGFbeta in human osteosarcoma and pancreatic carcinoma cells. In order to investigate a potential role of TIEG in the TGFbeta signal transduction pathway, we studied its impact on a Smad binding element (SBE) reporter which is known to be regulated by TGFbeta through the R-Smad proteins. We demonstrate that TIEG overexpression enhances TGFbeta induction of SBE reporter activity. TIEG overexpression also enhances induction of the endogenous TGFbeta regulated genes p21 and PAI-1. The ability of TIEG to enhance TGFbeta actions is Smad dependent since TIEG has no effect on SBE transcription in the absence of Smad4 expression or when an inhibitory Smad protein, Smad7, is overexpressed. Furthermore, TIEG overexpression enhances TGFbeta induced Smad2 phosphorylation. Lastly, TIEG appears to function by binding to and thereby repressing a specific element in the proximal promoter of the inhibitory Smad7 gene. In conclusion, these results describe a novel mechanism for the potentiation of TGFbeta/Smad signaling via repression of the inhibitory Smad7 gene by TIEG."
https://openalex.org/W1974460928,"Many nuclear-targeted proteins are transported through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) by the importin-α:β receptor. We now show that Npap60 (also called Nup50), a protein previously believed to be a structural component of the NPC, is a Ran binding protein and a cofactor for importin-α:β-mediated import. Npap60 is a tri-stable switch that alternates between binding modes. The C terminus binds importin-β through RanGTP. The N terminus binds the C terminus of importin-α, while a central domain binds importin-β. Npap60:importin-α:β binds cargo and can stimulate nuclear import. Endogenous Npap60 can shuttle and is accessible from the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope. These results identify Npap60 as a cofactor for importin-α:β nuclear import and as a previously unidentified subunit of the importin complex."
https://openalex.org/W2155198986,"Many features of the chaperone action of clusterin are similar to those of the intracellular small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) that, like clusterin, exist in solution as heterogeneous aggregates. Increased temperature induces dissociation of some sHSP aggregates and an enhanced chaperone action, suggesting that a dissociated form is the active chaperone species. We recently reported that clusterin aggregates dissociate at mildly acidic pH. To further explore the similarities between clusterin and the sHSPs, we tested the effects of temperature and pH on the structure of clusterin and its chaperone action. Our results demonstrate that increased temperature does not induce dissociation of clusterin aggregates, or other major structural changes, and has little effect on its chaperone action. However, we show that the chaperone action of clusterin is enhanced at mildly acidic pH. Clusterin is the first chaperone shown to be activated by reduced pH. This unique mode of activation appears to result from an increase in regions of solvent-exposed hydrophobicity, which is independent of any major changes in secondary or tertiary structure. We propose a model in which low pH-induced dissociation of clusterin aggregates increases the abundance of the heterodimeric chaperone-active species, which has greater hydrophobicity exposed to solution.

Although it migrates at about 70–80 kDa on SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry analyses have shown that the human serum form of clusterin comprises two major glycoforms, one of 58.5 kDa and the other of 63.5 kDa (1Kapron J.T.

Clusterin is normally secreted from mammalian cells and is both widely distributed and highly conserved; between different mammals, about 70–80% of the amino acid sequence of clusterin is identical (2Wilson M.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 95-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Clusterin expression is increased during pathological stresses (e.g. hydrostatic pressure insult or ischemic injury in the kidney) and certain disease states (e.g. gliomas) (3Jenne D.E. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 154-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). A variety of independent studies have suggested that clusterin protects cells from stresses such as tumor necrosis factor α, heat, and oxidative stress (2Wilson M.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 95-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies of clusterin knock-out mice have suggested that clusterin protects mice from (i) the pathological consequences of inflammation associated with experimentally induced autoimmune myocarditis (4McLaughlin L.

Chmielewski D. Barrie A. Witte D.P. Zhu G. Bissler J.J. Harmony J.A.K. Aronow B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The clusterin promoter contains a highly conserved 14-bp element, which is recognized by the transcriptional regulator heat shock factor 1 (8Michel D. Chatelain G. North S. Brun G. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Heat shock factor 1 activates expression of heat shock proteins (which protect cells from stresses) and clusterin (8Michel D. Chatelain G. North S. Brun G. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). An emerging theme is that clusterin is a protective molecule that is up-regulated during times of physiological stress. We recently demonstrated that clusterin is a molecular chaperone that potently inhibits the stress-induced precipitation of many different proteins in vitro (9Humphreys D. Carver J.A. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Wilson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6875-6881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 10Poon S. Rybchyn M.S. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Carver J.A. Wilson M.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15953-15960Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). When present at physiological concentrations in undiluted human serum, clusterin is able to inhibit protein precipitation induced by heat or reduction (10Poon S. Rybchyn M.S. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Carver J.A. Wilson M.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15953-15960Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus, the chaperone action of clusterin might be physiologically “protective” by reducing the rate or extent of progression of diseases associated with abnormally high levels of protein precipitation. The recent demonstration that aging clusterin knock-out mice develop insoluble protein deposits containing antibody (7Rosenberg M.E. Girton R. Finkel D. Chmielewski D. Barrie A. Witte D.P. Zhu G. Bissler J.J. Harmony J.A.K. Aronow B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) suggests that clusterin may inhibit antibody aggregation and precipitation in vivo. Furthermore, by complexing with partly unfolded proteins or other hydrophobic molecules at sites of inflammation, clusterin might solubilize these molecules and facilitate their recycling or disposal, in either case contributing toward resolution of inflammation. Many features of the chaperone action of clusterin are similar to that of the intracellular small heat shock proteins (sHSPs).1 For example, both types of chaperone interact specifically with stressed proteins that are slowly aggregating on the off-folding pathway toward a precipitated state (11Poon S. Treweek T.M. Wilson M.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Carver J.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) to form stable, solubilized high molecular weight complexes (2Wilson M.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 95-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 9Humphreys D. Carver J.A. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Wilson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6875-6881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). They do not themselves refold stressed proteins but, by binding to them, create a refolding-competent reservoir from which other ATP-dependent chaperones may retrieve functional proteins (10Poon S. Rybchyn M.S. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Carver J.A. Wilson M.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15953-15960Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure and chaperone action of at least some of the sHSPs is affected by increased temperature. For example, elevated temperature induces an increased rate of subunit exchange in mammalian αA-crystallin and a concomitant enhancement of its chaperone action (12Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Similarly, at low to physiological temperatures, yeast HSP26 exists in solution as oligomers. However, elevated temperature induces partial dissociation of these oligomers and an enhancement of the chaperone activity of the protein, implying that a non-aggregated, possibly dimeric form of HSP26 is responsible for its chaperone action (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S.X. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The heterodimer form of clusterin is known to reversibly aggregate; this process is pH-dependent with dissociation of the aggregates being favored at mildly acidic pH (14Hochgrebe T. Pankhurst G.J. Wilce J. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1411-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This transition is associated with increased binding of clusterin to its native ligands, heparin (15Pankhurst G.J. Bennett C.A. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4823-4830Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), immunoglobulins, glutathione S-transferase, and polymeric C9 (14Hochgrebe T. Pankhurst G.J. Wilce J. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1411-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not show whether low pH induces any changes in the chaperone activity of clusterin concomitant with dissociation of its aggregated forms nor whether the aggregation state and chaperone activities of clusterin were temperature-dependent. Therefore, we tested whether elevated temperature had any effects on the aggregation state or chaperone action of clusterin. In light of our recent results (14Hochgrebe T. Pankhurst G.J. Wilce J. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1411-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Pankhurst G.J. Bennett C.A. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4823-4830Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we also tested whether low pH affected the chaperone action of clusterin in vitro. In addition, we used circular dichroism spectroscopy to investigate structural changes induced in clusterin by changes in temperature and pH and binding studies with 4,4′-bis(1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate) (bisANS) to test whether hydrophobic interactions were important in the chaperone action of clusterin. The results demonstrate that, unlike the sHSPs, increased temperature does not induce dissociation of aggregated forms of clusterin or major changes in its secondary or tertiary structure and gave only a minor increase in the efficiency of its chaperone action. In contrast, the results show that (i) mildly acidic pH enhances the ability of clusterin to bind to stressed proteins and to inhibit their precipitation, (ii) this transition is accomplished with little measurable changes in the secondary or tertiary structure of clusterin but is accompanied by an increase in regions of solvent-exposed clusterin hydrophobicity, and (iii) the exposed regions of hydrophobicity on clusterin probably (at least partly) mediate its interactions with stressed proteins. Alcohol dehydrogenase, α-lactalbumin, 4,4′-bis(1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate) (bisANS), bovine serum albumin (BSA), catalase, casein, insulin, iodoacetamide,o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD), and ovotransferrin were all obtained from Sigma. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Sydney, Australia). All buffer salts and H2O2 were obtained from Ajax Chemical Co. (Sydney, Australia). Clusterin was purified from human serum (obtained from the Red Cross Blood Bank, Sydney, Australia) by immunoaffinity chromatography as previously described (16Wilson M.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) was prepared by thrombin cleavage of GST fusion proteins as described (17Heuer K.H. Mackay J.P. Podzebenko P. Bains N.P. Weiss A.S. King G.F. Easterbrook-Smith S.B.

Eye Res. 1990; 51: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter, linked to a Neslab RTE-111 cooling system, was used to acquire circular dichroism data. Far-UV (195–260 nm) CD studies were performed using a 1-mm cell with clusterin at 200 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Spectra were acquired at 50-millidegree sensitivity with a step resolution of 0.5 nm and a bandwidth of 1 nm. Estimates of the percentages of α-helical, β-sheet, β-turn, and unordered secondary structure were made by deconvolution of these data using the programs CDSSTR (19Johnson W.C. Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) and CONTIN-LL (20Provencher S.W. Glochner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). The means of the values calculated using these two programs are presented in Fig.1 B.

Spectra were acquired at 10-millidegree sensitivity with a resolution and bandwidth both of 0.2 nm. The data shown are mean residue ellipticities ([θ]MRE), calculated from an average of three scans, using values of 6.1 × 104 g/mol for the average molecular weight of serum clusterin (1Kapron J.T.

All fluorometric analyses were performed using an LS 50B luminometer controlled by FL Winlab software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All samples were degassed and filtered through 0.45-μm filters (Millipore, Sydney, Australia) prior to analysis. Clusterin (100 μg/ml) in PBS containing 10 μm bisANS was incubated at temperatures between 25 and 60 °C, and the fluorescence of bisANS at 480 nm (5 nm bandwidth) was measured with an excitation wavelength of 385 nm (5-nm bandwidth). Control samples contained 40% (v/v) ethanol instead of clusterin. This was done using the method of a previous study (21Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar G.S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Clusterin (0.8 mg/ml) was mixed with 100 μm bisANS in PBS and allowed to incubate at 25 °C for 20 min. Excess bisANS was removed by dialysis against PBS. The sample was then placed in a 3.5-cm Petri dish and illuminated at 254 nm for 20 min using a UV lamp, placed ∼2 cm above the sample. Control samples were treated similarly, except that they did not receive bisANS. Covalent labeling of the clusterin with bisANS was confirmed by SDS-PAGE of aliquots of these samples; a fluorescent band corresponding to the migration position of clusterin was observed (results not shown). A bisANS:clusterin molar ratio of 7:1 was calculated from absorbance measurements, assuming an extinction coefficient for bisANS at 385 nm of 16.7 mm−1cm−1. GST and ovotransferrin, at 20 μg/ml in 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, were adsorbed onto ELISA plates (Sarstedt Australia, Adelaide, Australia) by incubating at 37 °C (non-stress) or 60 °C (stress) for 1 h. BSA (1 mg/ml) was adsorbed onto ELISA plates by incubation in the same buffer for 5 h in the presence or absence of 20 mm DTT. The plates were then blocked with 1% (w/v) heat-denatured casein prepared in PBS. To exclude any possible formation of disulfide bonds between clusterin and BSA, DTT-treated BSA was then incubated with 5 mm iodoacetamide at 37 °C for 1 h. Clusterin, initially at 10 μg/ml in 50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.0, was then serially diluted in the same buffer in binary steps down each ELISA plate and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C (or other temperature as indicated). In other experiments, the procedure was the same, except that the 50 mm Na2HPO4 buffer was adjusted to pH 6.0–7.5; in some cases, instead of purified clusterin, normal human serum (initially undiluted, adjusted to pH 6.0–7.5) was applied to the plate and serially diluted in buffer of corresponding pH. An equi-volume mixture of hybridoma culture supernatants containing G7, 41D, and 78E anti-clusterin monoclonal antibodies was used to detect bound clusterin (9Humphreys D. Carver J.A. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Wilson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6875-6881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Bound primary antibodies were detected with sheep anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase (Silenus, Sydney, Australia) usingo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD, 2.5 mg/ml in 0.05m citric acid, 0.1 mNa2HPO4, pH 5.0, containing 0.03% (v/v) H2O2) as substrate. Insulin (100 μg/ml) and lysozyme (20 μg/ml) in 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 9.5, were adsorbed to ELISA plates for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were then incubated in the presence of 25 mm DTT in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C and then 10 mm iodoacetamide in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Alcohol dehydrogenase (20 μg/ml in 0.1 mNaHCO3, pH 9.5) was adsorbed to ELISA plates for 1 h at 60 °C. In all cases the plates were then blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA in 10 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm MES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 6 (PBS/MES/BSA). In some experiments, stressed lysozyme adsorbed to ELISA wells was incubated with 0–100 μm bisANS in PBS/MES/BSA for 1 h at 37 °C before the binding of clusterin to it was measured. PBS/MES/BSA containing clusterin (10 μg/ml) and bisANS (at concentrations indicated in the figure legends) was then added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, bound clusterin was detected using undiluted tissue culture supernatant from G7 hybridoma cells and, finally, sheep anti-mouse Ig-horseradish peroxidase and OPD substrate as described above. The effects of clusterin on stress-induced precipitation of target proteins was monitored by measuring, using an automated diode-array spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard GMBH, Germany), the turbidity associated with target protein precipitation as absorbance at 360 nm. In some experiments, the effects of different temperatures on the extent of DTT-induced protein precipitation in the presence and absence of clusterin were tested. Solutions of BSA (750 μg/ml), or a mixture of BSA (750 μg/ml) with clusterin (at 300 μg/ml), were prepared in 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, containing 20 mm DTT. These solutions were then incubated at 37 or 50 °C, and turbidity was measured every 15 min for 2.5–5 h. In one set of experiments, individual solutions of GST (250 μg/ml) or mixtures of GST (at the same final concentration) with 100 μg/ml of either unmodified clusterin or bisANS-modified clusterin (made as described above) in PBS were heated at 60 °C, and turbidity was measured as described every 30 s for 20 min. In other experiments, the extent of protein precipitation at pH 7.5 was compared with that at lower pH values, in the presence and absence of clusterin or the sHSP α-crystallin. Individual solutions of ovotransferrin (2 mg/ml) or mixtures of ovotransferrin at the same final concentration with clusterin (at 75 μg/ml) were prepared in 50 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 6.0, 6.5, or 7.5) and heated at 60 °C. Related experiments were performed identically, except that ovotransferrin was used at 1 mg/ml and α-crystallin (0.65 mg/ml) was used instead of clusterin. Measurements of turbidity were taken every 1 min for a total of 30 min and were performed as described above. Lastly, normal human serum or clusterin-depleted human serum (prepared by immunoaffinity chromatography) was diluted 1 in 10 in 50 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 6.0–7.5) and heated at 60 °C, and measurements of turbidity were taken as previously described. Kaleidagraph Version 3.51 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) was used for quantitative data analysis and plotting. The CD spectra shown were subjected to Stineman smoothing, which reduces the noise without perturbing the appearance of the data (22Lashuel H.A. Wurth C. Woo L. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13560-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Apparent inhibition constants for the inhibition of binding of clusterin to stressed proteins by bisANS were obtained by non-linear regression analysis of equation (1Kapron J.T. Hilliard G.M. Lakins J.N. Tenniswood M.P.R. West K.A. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2120-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) onto the data: B=Bmax1+[bisANS]/KiEquation 1 where B max and K irepresent the ELISA signal in the absence of bisANS and the apparent inhibition constant, respectively, and B is the measured ELISA signal. Statistical comparisons between different apparent inhibition constants were made using Student's t test;t values with p < 0.05 were considered significant. To assess the extent to which the overall secondary structure of clusterin changes with increasing temperature, we measured the far UV circular dichroism spectra of clusterin over the temperature range 25–85 °C. The results of calculation of the secondary structural content of clusterin from these data are shown in Fig.1 A. These analyses showed that, as clusterin was heated from 25 °C to 85 °C, its calculated α-helical content decreased from about 62% to about 35%, with a concomitant increase in calculated disordered structure from about 17% to about 28% and smaller increases in calculated β-sheet and β-turn content. The midpoint for these changes was about 55 °C. These results indicate that there was progressive loss of secondary structure in clusterin over this temperature range. Upon cooling these changes were largely reversible, with recovery of calculated α-helical content reaching 57% and disordered structure of 21% (Fig. 1 A). It is worth noting that clusterin retains significant secondary structure even at elevated temperatures, because a minimum in the spectra at about 200 nm, characteristic of disordered structure, was not observed at any temperature tested (data not shown). Similar analyses of near-UV CD spectra for clusterin indicated that there was also a progressive loss of tertiary structure as the temperature increased from 24 °C to 56 °C but that the changes induced at 56 °C were only partly reversible (data not shown). We assessed whether there were temperature-dependent changes in the level of exposed hydrophobic regions on clusterin by measuring the fluorescence of bisANS bound to clusterin at different temperatures. bisANS is a polarity-sensitive probe that has been used to monitor changes in exposed hydrophobic regions in sHSPs (23Carver J.A. Guerreiro N. Nicholls K.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Datta S.A. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34773-34778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). There was a progressive decrease in the fluorescence of bisANS bound to clusterin with temperature over the range 20–50 °C (Fig. 1 B). This change was reversible, because there was overlap of the heating and cooling traces (Fig. 1 B, compare open andclosed squares). A number of factors could contribute to this decrease: changed collisional quenching, increased non-radiative decay and temperature-dependent changes in exposed hydrophobic regions on clusterin. To assess the relative contributions of these, we also measured the temperature dependence of the fluorescence of bisANS in 40% ethanol (the relative quantum yield and emission maxima of bisANS in this solvent were similar to those of bisANS bound to clusterin). The fluorescence of bisANS in 40% ethanol also decreased with temperature over the range 20–50 °C, and this change was also reversible (Fig. 1 B, compare openand closed circles); this decrease can be attributed to the combined effects of changes in the collisional quenching and non-radiative decay of the excited state of bisANS with temperature. However, the finding that the decrease in the fluorescence of bisANS bound to clusterin over this temperature range was greater than the decrease in the fluorescence of bisANS in 40% ethanol suggests that there is a decrease in the extent of exposed hydrophobicity on clusterin with increasing temperature. When clusterin was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography at either 37 or 50 °C, there were no significant differences in the distribution of molecular species fractionated (data not shown). This indicates that variation in temperature over the range 37–50 °C had little effect on the distribution of clusterin between its 80-kDa heterodimeric form and larger oligomeric species. In ELISA, the binding of clusterin to stressed BSA was only slightly enhanced when the temperature was increased above 37 °C (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in other ELISAs, which indicated that the binding of clusterin to stressed GST or lysozyme was also only marginally affected by increased temperature (data not shown). Furthermore, temperature had only a small effect on the ability of clusterin to inhibit stress-induced protein precipitation. In the absence of clusterin, precipitation of BSA induced by reduction was more rapid at 50 °C than at 37 °C, but the final level of precipitation obtained in the absence of clusterin was similar at both temperatures (Fig. 3). At 50 °C, at the end of the time course (300 min), clusterin had decreased precipitation of BSA to a level about 13.5% less than that achieved at 37 °C (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained by testing the effects of increased temperature on the ability of clusterin to inhibit the reductive stress-induced precipitation of α-lactalbumin, lysozyme, and insulin (data not shown). Small effects of temperature on the chaperone action of clusterin were also confirmed in similar experiments comparing the ability of clusterin to inhibit precipitation of stressed proteins at 37 and 42 °C (data not shown). Collectively, the results indicate that (i) an increase in temperature from 37 to 50 °C causes only a small increase in the ability of clusterin to bind to stressed proteins and to inhibit their precipitation from solution, and (ii) the structural changes induced in clusterin by heating have only a limited effect on its binding to stressed protein.Figure 3Effects of temperature on the in vitro chaperone action of clusterin. BSA was stressed by reduction with DTT as described under “Experimental Procedures” and protein precipitation at either 37 °C (circular symbols) or 50 °C (square symbols) measured as absorbance at 360 nm as a function of time. These experiments were performed either in the absence of clusterin (empty symbols) or in the presence of clusterin (solid symbols) (see key). Each experiment was performed a minimum of three times, and the individual traces shown are representative.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We previously demonstrated that reduction of pH from 7.4 to 5.5 induced in clusterin (i) no apparent changes in the predicted contents of α-helical, β-sheet, and β-turn regions (detected by far-UV CD spectroscopy); (ii) significant dissociation of clusterin oligomers to form the 80-kDa clusterin heterodimer (detected by size exclusion chromatography); and (iii) an increase in the exposed hydrophobic surface (detected by measurements of bisANS fluorescence) (14Hochgrebe T. Pankhurst G.J. Wilce J. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1411-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To further examine the effects of mildly acidic pH on clusterin structure, we measured near-UV CD spectra for clusterin at pH 7.5 and 5.5. The results show that reducing the pH from 7.4 to 5.5 did not induce any major changes in the broad negative amplitude peak in [θ]MRE in the near-UV region (Fig. 4). This suggests that mildly acidic pH does not cause major changes in the tertiary structure of those regions of clusterin containing its aromatic residues. In ELISA, purified clusterin bound most strongly to all three stressed proteins at pH 6.0, with progressively less binding detected at pH 6.5 and 7.5 (Fig. 5,A–C). Similarly, enhanced binding o"

Commercially, glucosamine is sold over-the-counter to relieve arthritis. Although there is evidence in favor of the beneficial effects of glucosamine, the mechanism is unknown. Our data demonstrate that glucosamine suppresses the activation of T-lymphoblasts and dendritic cells in vitroas well as allogeneic mixed leukocyte reactivity in a dose-dependent manner. There was no inherent cellular toxicity involved in the inhibition, and the activity was not reproducible with other amine sugars. More importantly, glucosamine administration prolonged allogeneic cardiac allograft survival in vivo. We conclude that, despite its documented effects on insulin sensitivity, glucosamine possesses immunosuppressive activity and could be beneficial as an immunosuppressive agent.

Upon uptake, glucose is immediately phosphorylated and enzymatically converted into a series of substrates that will be either converted into glycogen, lipids, and proteins or used to generate ATP and CO2. 2–3% of glucose 6-phosphate, the immediate intracellular glucose derivative following uptake, is diverted into a pathway known as the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (1Rossetti L.

In addition, glucosamine also inhibits platelet aggregation and ATP release induced byStaphylococcus aureus, ADP, epinephrine, and collagen (21Bertram J. Ragatz B.H. Baldwin W. Iatrides P.G. Thromb. Res. 1981; 23: 301-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which glucosamine acts are not completely clear; however, it has been shown to alter the ultrastructure of plasma and intracellular membranes (9Molnar Z. Bekesi J.G.

Immunology. 1988; 64: 181-184PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that monosaccharides, especially amino sugars, are able to inhibit cytotoxic T-lymphocyte function in culture, preventing target lysis in a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone-specific manner. Yagita et al.further demonstrated that free hexosamines are able to inhibit natural killer cell cytotoxicity in culture (24Yagita M. Seppo A. Renkonen O. Saksela E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5600-5604PubMed Google Scholar, 25Yagita M. Nakajima M. Saksela E. Cell. Immunol. 1989; 122: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and that hexosamine release by tumors can, in part, explain escape of tumors from immune cell lysis (24Yagita M. Seppo A. Renkonen O. Saksela E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5600-5604PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, other than the observation that amiprilose, a synthetic monosaccharide, is able to attenuate T-cell activation in a dose-specific manner (26Chang D.M. Immunopharmacol. Immunotoxicol. 1995; 17: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), no other work has been published on the utility of sugar derivatives, especially amino sugar derivatives (glucosamine, mannosamine, lactosamine, and fructosamine), as immunoregulatory agents. However, a recent report by Gouze et al. (27Gouze J.N. Bianchi A. Becuwe P. Dauca M. Netter P. Magdalou J. Terlain B. Bordji K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) demonstrated glucosamine-dependent inhibition of NF-κB activity in rat chondrocytes and IL-1β1bioactivity by up-regulation of the type II IL-1 decoy receptor. Glucosamine has received considerable attention in a number of studies over the past 5 years as an agent that may be beneficial for arthritis (28Reginster J.Y. Deroisy R. Rovati L.C. Lee R.L.

Sold mainly over-the-counter in various formulations (glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine sulfate with chondroitin sulfate), manufacturers suggest that the beneficial effects of their compounds are due to the reconstruction of joint cartilage, one of the constituents of which is glucosamine in the form of glycoproteins of structural proteoglycans. A recent study in humans demonstrated beneficial effects of glucosamine in arthritis, although no firm conclusions could be made (28Reginster J.Y. Deroisy R. Rovati L.C. Lee R.L. Lejeune E. Bruyere O. Giacovelli G. Henrotin Y. Dacre J.E. Gossett C. Lancet. 2001; 357: 251-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). The actual mechanism by which glucosamine may benefit the patient remains unknown, although a very recent investigation suggests that it may interfere with pro-inflammatory cytokine action on human chondrocytes (32Shikhman A.R. Kuhn K. Alaaeddine N. Lotz M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5155-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, glucosamine induces insulin resistance in the absence of high glucose or glutamine (2Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as insulin resistance in isolated rat muscle (33Robinson K.A. Sens D.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1333-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Glucosamine has also been shown to modulate the effects of insulin and glucose on pyruvate kinase (34Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9718-9723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glycogen synthase (33Robinson K.A. Sens D.A. Buse M.G.

A short-term exposure of cultured rat adipocytes to glucosamine decreases GLUT-4 activity, and longer, 16-h incubations result in decreased GLUT-4 cell surface levels (36Chen H. Ing B.L. Robinson K.A. Feagin A.C. Buse M.G. Quon M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 135: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, glucosamine infusion can induce insulin resistance in normoglycemic (but not hyperglycemic) rats, and this is accompanied by impaired GLUT-4 translocation to the cell surface of skeletal muscle in response to insulin (37Rossetti L. Hawkins M. Chen W. Gindi J. Barzilai N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Insulin sensitivity in rat cardiac muscle and liver has also been shown to be affected by glucosamine infusion (38Virkamaki A. Daniels M.C. Hamalainen S. Utriainen T. McClain D. Yki-Jarvinen H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2501-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). More importantly, acute glucosamine infusion into humans has been demonstrated to mimic some of the metabolic aspects of insulin resistance in human type II diabetes mellitus (39Monauni T. Zenti M.G. Cretti A. Daniels M.C. Targher G. Caruso B. Caputo M. McClain D. Del Prato S. Giaccari A. Muggeo M. Bonora E. Bonadonna R.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 926-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To unravel the mechanisms involved in the possible beneficial effects of glucosamine, despite its reported effects on insulin sensitivity, we have begun to examine the effects of glucosamine on immune cell activation and inflammatory processes. In initial studies, we have discovered that glucosamine addition to immune cells in vitro prevented both their activation and their ability to initiate the mixed leukocyte reaction. More importantly, a single daily intravenous injection of glucosamine was able to prolong cardiac allograft survival in mice. Based on these data, we suggest that glucosamine alone or in its different formulations could be considered as a novel immunosuppressive agent with potential clinical utility. The Jurkat T-lymphoblast cell line used in this study is a human T-lymphocyte precursor cell line that responds identically to nonspecific, non-antigenic stimulation signals and is available from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC TIB-152) (40Cassel D.L. Hoxie J.A. Cooper R.A. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4582-4586PubMed Google Scholar, 41Nordmann R. Andersen E. Trussardi R. Mazer N.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It has been extensively used to identify and unravel T-cell activation and signaling pathways (42–53). To test the effects on T-cell activation of a number of agents, we designed appropriate Jurkat-based reporter cell lines. We engineered the Jurkat cell line to stably express the β-galactosidase gene under the control of four tandemly arranged NFATcis-acting enhancer elements derived from the NFAT-PathDetect reporter plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). NFAT describes the family of intracellular transcription factors that are among the very first to be activated in response to T-cell antigen receptor ligation or nonspecific signals (54Li C. Lai C.F.

NFAT quickly translocates to the nucleus and activates the IL-2 gene, one of a number of genes whose products are important for maintaining and propagating the T-cell activation signal. The engineered Jurkat T-cells, which we term JLZB (β-galactosidase reporter), express β-galactosidase when exposed to factors that engage their T-cell receptors in a specific manner or to chemical nonspecific factors such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. Cultures were exposed to hygromycin (Invitrogen) to select stably transfected clones. Individual clones were isolated and tested for NFAT inducibility. In a similar fashion, we also created a stable Jurkat cell line constitutively expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the SRα promoter (consisting of the SV40 early promoter and the R-U5 segment of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 long terminal repeat). We designated this cell line as JSR-GFP. Stably transfected JSR-GFP clones were selected with 0.25 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). To determine promoter activation, we cultured 3 × 106 cells of each clone selected overnight in 1 ml of ionomycin (1 μg/ml; Calbiochem) and PMA (25 ng/ml; Sigma) in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (Invitrogen); and the next day, we quantitated the amount of β-galactosidase using a commercially available kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) or by FACS analysis of JSR-GFP clones. We selected the clones exhibiting the highest inducibility for further experimentation. To examine the effects of glucosamine on T-cell activation, we added pure glucosamine (Sigma) dissolved in PBS (Sigma) to cultures of JLZB or JSR-GFP cells in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. Glucosamine was added to final concentrations ranging from 1 μm to 10 mm for 18–24 h in the presence or absence of PMA and ionomycin at activating concentrations. As a control, we incubated parallel cultures in equal concentrations of galactosamine and mannosamine (both purchased from Sigma). Cells were collected and centrifuged at 600 × g, and the pellets were washed extensively with PBS. The cells were subsequently lysed in reporter gene lysis buffer (Promega) or directly analyzed by FACS (JSR-GFP cells) in a FACSVantage SE flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Reporter cell activation was determined by assessing the level of β-galactosidase activity in the lysates of JLZB cells using the kit from Tropix Inc. Concurrently, secreted IL-2 levels were determined in the supernatant of the cells using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cell viability in all instances and following treatment was measured using a commercially available reagent based on the 3-(4-5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H- tetrazolium (MTS) assay (CellTiter96 Aqueous, Promega). To examine the reversibility of the effects of glucosamine on reporter gene activity, JLZB cells were first stimulated with PMA and ionomycin in the presence or absence of 10 mm glucosamine. 24 h later, the cells were washed; the media were replaced; and the cells were once again stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described above. To determine the effects of glucosamine administration on ATP levels in cultured Jurkat T-cells, we measured ATP indirectly using a commercially available reagent (ENLITEN, Promega). The assay is based on the ATP-dependent conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin, AMP, pyrophosphate, carbon dioxide, and light, measured in a luminometer (560 nm). The intensity of emitted light is directly proportional to the amount of ATP present in the sample. Jurkat T-cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin as described above in the presence or absence of 10 mm glucosamine for 18 h. The cells were extensively washed, and equal numbers of cells from each treatment group as well as untreated cells were then lysed. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and an aliquot of the supernatant was used to assess ATP levels using the ENLITEN reagent. The effects of glucosamine were compared with those of immunosuppressive agents in clinical use (cyclosporin A and tacrolimus (FK-506)) and examined using the JLZB reporter cell line. Following the addition of glucosamine, galactosamine, or mannosamine (at different final concentrations ranging from 10 nm to 10 mm), cyclosporin A (Sandimmune, 100 ng/ml; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), or tacrolimus (10 ng/ml; Prograf, Fujisawa, Deerfield, IL) to 3 × 106 cells, PMA and ionomycin were added, and the cells were incubated for 18–24 h. The next day, the culture supernatants were collected, and the cells were lysed. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described above. 5–8-week-old mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). C57/BL10 mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were obtained from bone marrow progenitors cultured with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IL-4 (R&D Systems) essentially as described (59Fu F., Li, Y. Qian S., Lu, L. Chambers F. Starzl T.E. Fung J.J. Thomson A.W. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 60Lu L. McCaslin D. Starzl T.E. Thomson A.W. Transplantation. 1995; 60: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). By this method, the purity of dendritic cells is usually >85% as assessed by FACS analysis for dendritic cell surface markers (CD86, CD80, CD40, DEC-205, and class I and II major histocompatibility complexes; purchased from BD Biosciences) (59Fu F., Li, Y. Qian S., Lu, L. Chambers F. Starzl T.E. Fung J.J. Thomson A.W. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 60Lu L. McCaslin D. Starzl T.E. Thomson A.W. Transplantation. 1995; 60: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). 1 × 105 dendritic cells were treated with glucosamine, galactosamine, or mannosamine (all at a final concentration of 10 mm) or PBS for 18–24 h and then stimulated with 25 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma) for another 18–24 h. At the end of the stimulation, the culture supernatants were assessed for nitrite production, a marker of dendritic cell activation, using the Griess reagent method (Promega). Irradiated C57/BL10 splenocytes and C3H/HeJ mouse T-lymphocytes (Jackson Laboratories) were co-cultured in the presence or absence of glucosamine, galactosamine, or mannosamine (2.5, 5, and 10 mm final concentrations) or medium alone for 5 days. At the end of the co-culture, tritiated thymidine was added for 18 h, and the radioactivity incorporated into the cells was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To examine the effects of glucosamine on cardiac allograft survival, heterotopic transplantation of C3H/HeJ hearts into C57/BL10 mice was performed as described (59Fu F., Li, Y. Qian S., Lu, L. Chambers F. Starzl T.E. Fung J.J. Thomson A.W. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). There is complete mismatch at the major histocompatibility complex between these two species. Each recipient was conditioned with one intravenous injection of 8, 20, or 40 μmol of glucosamine 1 day prior to transplantation and one daily intravenous injection of 40 μmol of glucosamine beginning on the 2nd day following transplantation until the end of the experiment (defined as the time of transplant rejection). To compare the efficacy of glucosamine with that of immunosuppressive agents in clinical use, we also treated a subset of mice with FK-506 (0.5 mg/kg/day) or cyclosporin A (10 mg/kg/day) once a day for 7 days following transplantation alone or in combination with different amounts of glucosamine. As a control, we also gave a single daily intravenous injection of 40 μmol of mannosamine or galactosamine to parallel sets of mice. Rejection of the transplant was determined to be the time at which palpable beating of the heart ceased. The effects of glucosamine on immune cell activationin vitro were first examined. Three parameters were evaluated: T-cell activation, dendritic cell activation, and allogeneic MLR. To assess T-cell activation, we added glucosamine to Jurkat T-lymphoblasts stably transfected with the β-galactosidase gene under the control of NFAT cis-acting enhancer elements in tandem (JLZB cell line). Fig. 1 Ashows that the addition of 10 mm glucosamine to JLZB reporter cells for 18 h in the presence of chemical activators of T-cell function (PMA and ionomycin) resulted in a nearly complete prevention of expression of β-galactosidase as assessed by β-galactosidase activity. Additionally, Fig. 1 B shows a significant suppression of IL-2 production by the same cells in the culture supernatants. To compare the efficacy of glucosamine with that of commonly used immunosuppressive agents, we assessed T-cell activation in the JLZB reporter cell line in the presence of cyclosporin A or tacrolimus (FK-506). Fig. 1 A shows that glucosamine at concentrations as low as 500 μm was as effective as clinical doses of cyclosporin (100 ng/ml) and FK-506 (10 ng/ml) in suppressing the activation of the JLZB reporter cell line. The results also demonstrate that glucosamine inhibited NFAT-dependent transcription stimulated by PMA and ionomycin at similar levels compared with cyclosporin. To control for potential nonspecific effects of glucosamine, we examined the effects of other aminated sugars (galactosamine and mannosamine) on IL-2 production by Jurkat T-cells in response to PMA and ionomycin. Fig. 1 C demonstrates that galactosamine was unable to prevent IL-2 production in response to a PMA/ionomycin challenge. Interestingly, mannosamine was able to significantly prevent IL-2 production, but not at levels achievable by glucosamine (100 ± 20 ng/ml IL-2 in Jurkat cell supernatants versus 50 ± 36 ng/ml in mannosamine- and glucosamine-treated cells following PMA/ionomycin stimulation). To rule out the possibility that glucosamine exerted a nonspecific toxic effect on Jurkat T-cells, we examined cell viability based on MTS assessment using a commercially available reagent (CellTiter96 Aqueous, Promega). This assay determines metabolically viable cells, which convert the MTS substrate into an aqueous soluble formazan by dehydrogenases found in metabolically active cells. The quantity of formazan product as measured by the amount of 490 nm absorbance is directly proportional to the number of living cells in culture. Fig. 1 D shows that no significant differences were observed in the viability of untreated and glucosamine-treated wild-type and JLZB cells. The observed decrease in viability of PMA/ionomycin-treated cells could be attributable to activation-induced cell death, very likely mediated through Fas/Fas ligand interactions, because one mechanism by which the response of activated T-cells is terminated is by fratricidal Fas/Fas ligand-induced apoptosis. To rule out the possibility that glucosamine induces irreversible changes in the response of JLZB cells to PMA/ionomycin, we first cultured JLZB cells overnight in the presence of 10 mmglucosamine. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, and fresh medium was added. PMA and ionomycin were added 24 h thereafter. Fig. 1 E shows that these JLZB cells responded appropriately to PMA/ionomycin, demonstrating that the effects of glucosamine are reversible. Finally, to show that glucosamine-induced suppression of NFAT promoter element-driven lacZreporter expression is specific for NFAT-dependent transactivation and not a nonspecific effect on general promoter activity, we tested the effects of glucosamine on JSR-GFP cells, stably transfected Jurkat cells with the constitutive SRα promoter driving expression of a GFP cassette. Fig. 1 F presents data from FACS analysis of untreated and glucosamine-treated cells in the form of mean fluorescence intensity and shows GFP expression in JSR-GFP cells treated with glucosamine following PMA/ionomycin stimulation. The fluorescence profiles of glucosamine-free cell cultures and glucosamine-treated cultures following PMA/ionomycin stimulation were identical, as illustrated in Fig. 1 F. It is worth noting that, in prior experiments whose data are illustrated above (Fig. 1 A), β-galactosidase gene expression under the control of NFAT elements was suppressed by glucosamine, in contrast with what was observed in the same cell background in which a reporter gene was driven by a “constitutive” promoter (SRα). To determine whether glucosamine affected the levels of ATP, we measured luciferin conversion into light in Jurkat T-cells cultured in 10 mm glucosamine overnight with or without PMA/ionomycin activation. Fig. 1 G demonstrates that ATP levels in the supernatants of cells treated with glucosamine (10 mm final concentration) with or without PMA/ionomycin stimulation were no different from those in cells that were not exposed to the sugar. Finally, another indication of normal metabolic activity of glucosamine-treated cells was that constitutive expression of GFP in JSR-GFP cells and inducible lacZ expression in JLZB cells were easily inhibited by cycloheximide, but not by 10 mm glucosamine (data not shown). Dendritic cells are the most potent immunostimulatory cells yet characterized. They are at the center of a complex immune cell network and define, if not dictate, the nature of the immune response and its strength. Dendritic cells can either traffic through tissues or exist within tissues as resident cells. Upon local disruption of tissue integrity by foreign pathogen invasion or by endogenous changes, dendritic cells acquire molecules by a variety of uptake pathways and migrate to the local lymphoid organs, where they engage naive T-cells via class I and II major histocompatibility complex/T-cell rece"

Although both transcription factors share a common domain involved in forming multimers, we demonstrate that Sp1 and Sp3 form separate complexes in estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cells. Sp1 and Sp3 complexes associate with histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 2. Although most HDAC2 is not phosphorylated in the breast cancer cells, HDAC2 bound to Sp1 and Sp3 and cross-linked to chromatinin situ is highly enriched in a phosphorylated form that has a reduced mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. We show that protein kinase CK2 is associated with and phosphorylates HDAC2. Alkaline phosphatase treatment of HDAC2 and Sp1 and Sp3 complexes reduced the associated HDAC activity. Protein kinase CK2 is up-regulated in several cancers including breast cancer, and Sp1 and Sp3 have key roles in estrogen-induced proliferation and gene expression in estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells.

Acetylation of the core histones favors decondensation of the chromatin fiber by preventing interfiber interactions, whereas the unacetylated histone state contributes to chromatin condensation (1Wang X., He, C.

Class I HDACs, such as HDAC1 and HDAC2, are homologous to yeast RPD3, whereas class II HDACs are similar to yeast HDA1. Class III HDACs are related to yeast SIR2 (5Davie J.R. Moniwa M. Crit Rev.

Sp3 has three isoforms, a long (L-Sp3) and two short forms (M1-Sp3, M2-Sp3) that are the products of differential translational initiation (10Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Sp3 may act as a repressor or an activator, with the short forms acting only as repressors (10Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The protein structure of L-Sp3 is very similar to that of Sp1, except that Sp3 has a repression domain located N-terminal to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain (11Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the relative levels of Sp3 forms change with differentiation, with the differentiated Caco-2 cells expressing more long than short forms (12Gartel A.L. Goufman E. Najmabadi F. Tyner A.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5182-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Further, alterations in the relative levels of Sp1 to Sp3 have been recorded, with Sp3 levels being greater than Sp1 in primary keratinocytes (13Apt D. Watts R.M. Suske G. Bernard H.U. Virology. 1996; 224: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the association of histone deacetylase with Sp3 in human breast cancer cells. We found that Sp3 and Sp1 were associated with HDAC1 and a modified form of HDAC2. HDAC2 is shown to be associated with protein kinase CK2 and phosphorylated by this enzyme. The low abundance phosphorylated form of HDAC2 is preferentially associated with chromatin. Human breast cancer T5 cells, estrogen receptor-positive and hormone-dependent, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 5% fetal bovine serum as previously described (4Sun J.-M.

In vitro evidence suggests that Sp1 and Sp3 may form heteromultimers (24Kennett S.B. Moorefield K.S. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9780-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sequential immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting experiments tested whether Sp1 associated with Sp3 in situ in T5 human breast cancer cells. A T5 cell lysate was incubated with anti-Sp1 antibodies, and the immunoprecipitate was collected. The immunodepleted supernatant was next incubated with anti-Sp3 antibodies, and the immunoprecipitate was harvested. Fig. 1 shows the analyses of the fractions immunochemically stained with anti-Sp3 or anti-Sp1 antibodies. Anti-Sp1 antibodies efficiently immunoprecipitated Sp1 but not Sp3 (lane 2), whereas antibodies against Sp3 immunoprecipitated Sp3 but not Sp1 (lane 4). The results demonstrated that Sp1 does not associate with Sp3 in T5 cells. Further, the immunoblot results show that T5 breast cancer cells express the L-, M1-, and M2-Sp3 forms, with the latter lower molecular mass forms of Sp3 predominating. Quantification of Sp1 and Sp3 levels on immunoblots indicated that Sp1 was 3-fold more abundant than Sp3. It has been reported that Sp1 recruits HDAC1 to repress transcription (25Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that Sp3 also recruits HDAC to repress transcription. Fig. 2 A shows that Sp1 and Sp3 were associated with HDAC activity. Culturing breast cancer cells in the absence or presence of estradiol did not affect the HDAC activity associated with these transcription factors. The sequential immunoprecipitation strategy with anti-Sp1 followed by anti-Sp3 antibodies was applied to decide which of the HDACs was bound to Sp1 or Sp3. Fig. 2 B shows that Sp1 and Sp3 were associated with HDAC1 and HDAC2. Both immunoprecipitates were highly enriched in a slower migrating form of HDAC2. Neither Sp1 nor Sp3 was associated with HDAC3 (data not shown). The preferential association of the slower migrating form of HDAC2 with the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 suggested that this form of HDAC2 may be selectively in contact with chromatin. T5 cells were incubated with the cross-linker cisplatin, and the proteins cross-linked to nuclear DNA in situ were isolated. Unlike formaldehyde, cisplatin does not form protein-protein cross-links. Fig.3 A shows that the slower migrating form of HDAC2 was enriched in the proteins cross-linked to DNA. Similar results were obtained with the cross-linker formaldehyde. HDAC3 was not cross-linked to nuclear DNA with cisplatin. As HDAC1 is phosphorylated (26Cai R. Kwon P. Yan-Neale Y. Sambuccetti L. Fischer D. Cohen D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Pflum M.K. Tong J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47733-47741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we determined whether the slower migrating form of HDAC2 was phosphorylated by incubating the proteins cross-linked to DNA with alkaline phosphatase. Fig. 3 Bdemonstrates that incubation of the protein sample with alkaline phosphatase resulted in the disappearance of the slower migrating form of HDAC2 and the appearance of a band co-migrating with the major HDAC2 band present in the cell lysate. Identical results were obtained when the Sp1 or Sp3 immunoprecipitates were incubated with alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). The phosphorylated form of HDAC1 has a reduced mobility on SDS gels (27Pflum M.K. Tong J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47733-47741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, we did not observe an enrichment of the slower migrating HDAC1-phosphorylated form in the Sp1 or Sp3 immunoprecipitates or in the protein fraction cross-linked to DNA with cisplatin. Treatment of these fractions with alkaline phosphatase did not alter the mobility of HDAC1, ruling out the possibility that the entire HDAC1 population was phosphorylated. Recently, HDAC1 was shown to be phosphorylated by CK2 (26Cai R. Kwon P. Yan-Neale Y. Sambuccetti L. Fischer D. Cohen D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Pflum M.K. Tong J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47733-47741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The CK2 phosphorylation sites located in the C-terminal region of HDAC1 are conserved in HDAC2 (27Pflum M.K. Tong J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47733-47741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Fig.4 A illustrates that incubation of HDAC2 in the cell lysate with CK2 and ATP generates the slower migrating HDAC2 form. Inhibition of CK2 with apigenin prevented the appearance of this band. Further, GST-HDAC2 and casein but not GST were radiolabeled with CK2 and [32P]ATP (Fig.4 B). To decide if CK2 was associated with HDAC2, HDAC2 and HDAC1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-CK2α or anti-CK2α′ antibodies (Fig. 4 C). HDAC2 and to a lesser extent HDAC1 were bound to CK2. Immunoblotting experiments of Sp1 and Sp3 immunoprecipitates revealed the presence of CK2 (data not shown). In immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments we determined that most HDAC2 was in complex with HDAC1 in T5 breast cancer cells. HDAC1, which was more abundant than HDAC2, was in complex with HDAC2 and with other complexes not containing HDAC2. Incubation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 immunoprecipitates with alkaline phosphatase reduced the HDAC activity of the complexes (Fig. 5). The associated HDAC activities with Sp1 and Sp3 immunoprecipitates were also reduced when incubated with alkaline phosphatase. In summary, we demonstrate that Sp3 and Sp1 are associated with HDAC1 and CK2-phosphorylated HDAC2. Although most HDAC2 is in an unmodified state, phosphorylated HDAC2 is preferentially associated with Sp1, Sp3, and chromatin in human breast cancer cells. CK2 is up-regulated in several cancers including breast cancer, and there is evidence that CK2 may promote breast cancer by deregulating key transcription processes (28Landesman-Bollag E.

Many estrogen-induced genes (e.g. cathepsin D, c-fos, adenine deaminase, and c-myc) in human breast cancer cells have a half-site estrogen response element positioned next to a Sp1 binding site (31Safe S.

Both Sp1 and Sp3 may recruit HDAC1 and phosphorylated HDAC2 to these sites, whereas the estrogen receptor recruits histone acetyltransferases CBP (cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein) and p300, resulting in dynamic acetylation of histones and transcription factors located at the promoters of these genes (4Sun J.-M.

CK2 phosphorylation of HDAC2 recruited by Sp1 or Sp3 would regulate HDAC activity and alter the balance of histone deacetylase and histone acetyltransferase activities and dynamic chromatin remodeling of these estrogen-regulated promoters."

The ratio of the level of sAPX mRNAs (sAPX-I, -II, and -III) to tAPX-I mRNA was close to 1 in leaf, whereas the ratio in root was greatly elevated due to an increase in sAPX-III and a decrease in tAPX-I resulting from the alternative excision of intron 11 and intron 12, respectively. A putative splicing regulatory cis element (SRE), which is highly conserved in the sequences of chlAPX genes of higher plants, was identified upstream of the acceptor site in intron 12. The deletion of the SRE sequence diminished the splicing efficiency of intron 12 in tobacco leafin vivo. Gel-shift analysis showed that SRE interacts strongly with a nuclear protein from leaves but not those from the roots of spinach and tobacco.

Chloroplasts are potentially a powerful source of oxidants, and sites within the cells are at greatest risk of photooxidative damage (1Asada K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 601-639Google Scholar, 2Noctor G. Foyer C.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 249-279Google Scholar). Even under optimal conditions, the process of chloroplastic electron transport produces active oxygen species (AOS) 1The abbreviations used are: AOS, active oxygen species; APX, ascorbate peroxidase; chlAPX, chloroplastic (stromal and thylakoid-bound) APX; sAPX, stromal APX; tAPX, thylakoid-bound APX; Rubisco, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; RT, reverse transcriptase; FW, fresh weight; nt, nucleotide(s); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; CaMV, cauliflower mosaic virus; SRE, splicing regulatory cis element; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; SR protein, serine/arginine-rich protein. such as superoxide radical, H2O2, and hydroxyl radical. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11), which plays an important role in scavenging H2O2, exists as stromal soluble (sAPX) and thylakoid membrane-bound (tAPX) forms in chloroplasts of higher plants (1Asada K.

Bot. 2002; 53: 1305-1319Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that, in spinach sAPX, the N-terminal 364 amino acids encoding the transit peptide and the catalytic domains are completely identical with those of tAPX, except for the C-terminal 50 amino acids, and that chloroplastic APX (chlAPX) isoenzymes, which are encoded by a single gene (ApxII), are produced by the alternative splicing of the 3′-terminal region of ApxII pre-mRNA in spinach (4Ishikawa T. Sakai K. Yoshimura K. Takeda T. Shigeoka S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 289-293Google Scholar, 5Ishikawa T. Yoshimura K. Tamoi M. Takeda T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 795-800Google Scholar). The ApxII contained 13 exons split by 12 introns. The penultimate exon 12 consisted of one codon (Asp-365) for sAPX mRNAs before the termination codon and the entire 3′-untranslated region, including a potential polyadenylation signal. The final exon 13 consisted of the corresponding coding sequence of the thylakoid membrane-spanning domain for tAPX mRNA before the termination codon and the entire 3′-untranslated region, including a potential polyadenylation signal. Similar observations have also been made in pumpkin (6Mano S. Yamaguchi K. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 21-26Google Scholar) and Mesemnbryanthemum crystallinum(GenBankTM accession numbers AF069315 for tAPX and AF069316for sAPX). At the present time, only Arabidopsis thaliana has been found to contain two different genes for chlAPX isoenzymes (7Jespersen H.M. Kjaersgard I.V.H. Ostergaard L. Welinder K.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 305-310Google Scholar). Alternative splicing is a common mechanism of regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional stage in eukaryotic organisms (8McKeown M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 133-155Google Scholar, 9Simpson G.G. Filipowicz W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 1-41Google Scholar). Some alternative splicing events are constitutive, with similar ratios of mRNA variants in different cells, whereas others are subject to tissue-specific or developmental regulation (8McKeown M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 133-155Google Scholar). In a few cases in insects and vertebrates, the mechanism underlying alternative splicing events has been elucidated, and cis elements andtrans-acting regulators have been characterized (8McKeown M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 133-155Google Scholar, 10Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-358Google Scholar, 11Valcarel J. Singh R. Green M.R. Pre-mRNA Processing. R. G. Landes Publishers, Georgetown, TX1995: 97-112Google Scholar). In higher plants, a number of cases of alternative splicing have been reported, although the biological significance of those produced isoforms is unknown (9Simpson G.G. Filipowicz W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 1-41Google Scholar). It is likely that a few alternative splicing events are regulated by unique factors specific to plants. The usage of alternative 5′ splice sites in Rubisco activase pre-mRNA produced two protein isoforms that differ only at the C terminus (12Rundle S.J. Zielinski R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14802-14807Google Scholar). Although both isoforms can activate Rubisco, only the larger one is redox-regulated. The alternative splicing of the hydroxypyruvate reductase gene in pumpkin, which produces two proteins, peroxisome and cytosol types, is regulated by light (13Mano S. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 309-320Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanisms of alternative splicing are not clear in any of those cases in higher plants. RT-PCR analysis using polyadenylated RNA and polysomal RNA from spinach leaves revealed that four types of chlAPX mRNA variants, one form (tAPX-I) encoding tAPX and three forms (sAPX-I, sAPX-II, and sAPX-III) encoding sAPX, are produced by alternative splicing events, including alternative selection of polyadenylation sites and alternative splicing of introns 11 and 12, of the 3′-terminal region of chlAPX pre-mRNA (see Fig. 1) (5Ishikawa T. Yoshimura K. Tamoi M. Takeda T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 795-800Google Scholar, 14Yoshimura K. Yabuta Y. Tamoi M. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 41-48Google Scholar). In the mature spinach leaf, the estimated expression ratios of mRNA variants sAPX-I, sAPX-II, sAPX-III, and tAPX-I based on by S1 nuclease analysis were 21:5:32:42 (14Yoshimura K. Yabuta Y. Tamoi M. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 41-48Google Scholar). The levels of enzymatic activity of tAPX and sAPX were almost equal, which was roughly in agreement with the ratio of expression of total sAPX mRNAs to tAPX mRNA (15Yoshimura K. Yabuta Y. Tamoi M. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 223-233Google Scholar). However, it seems likely that the relative levels of expression of tAPX and sAPX change according to the plant species, leaf age, and various environmental conditions (15Yoshimura K. Yabuta Y. Tamoi M. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 223-233Google Scholar, 16Miyagawa Y. Tamoi M. Shigeoka S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 311-320Google Scholar). Mano et al. (6Mano S. Yamaguchi K. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 21-26Google Scholar) have reported that the accumulation of sAPX and tAPX isoenzymes in pumpkin cotyledons is differently regulated during germination and the subsequent greening. These observations suggest that alternative splicing events of chlAPX pre-mRNA may be essential for changing the ratios and the amounts of chlAPX isoenzymes. Therefore, a detailed analysis of the regulatory mechanism of the alternative splicing of pre-mRNA of chlAPX isoenzymes should help to elucidate their respective functions. In this study, we analyzed the ratio of expression of chlAPX isoenzymes in several tissues of mature spinach plants and the possible existence of a cis element involved as a regulatory factor in alternative splicing. Spinach seedlings (Spinacia oleracea) were grown in a climate chamber under the following conditions: an 8-h photoperiod, illumination of 300 μE m−2s−1, and 15 ± 2.5 °C for 4 weeks. Tobacco seedlings (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) were grown in a climate chamber under the following conditions: a 12-h photoperiod, illumination of 300 μE m−2 s−1, and 25/20 °C (day/night) for 8 weeks. Spinach and tobacco mature plants were collected, frozen immediately in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until use in the analyses described in the text. All other chemicals were of the highest purity grade commercially available. Total RNA (30 μg each) was isolated from leaves, stems, and roots (1 g, FW each) of spinach plants as previously described (15Yoshimura K. Yabuta Y. Tamoi M. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 223-233Google Scholar), subjected to electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, and transferred to a Hybond N membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Prehybridization was carried out at 55 °C for 6 h in a hybridization buffer containing 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 100 μg ml−1 denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membrane was hybridized at 55 °C for 12 h in the presence of [α-32P]CTP random-primed cDNA probe. As a result of alternative splicing events, four mRNA variants are generated (see Fig. 1). sAPX-II and sAPX-III mRNAs contained a sequence derived from exon 13, including the coding sequence of the membrane-anchoring segment of tAPX as a untranslated region. Furthermore, nucleotide lengths of sAPX-I, -II, -III, and tAPX-I were 1634, 1961, 1860, and 1691 nt, respectively. Therefore, we found it difficult to determine the respective transcript levels of sAPX and tAPX isoenzymes by the Northern blot analysis and detected as the transcript level of chlAPX added together with those of tAPX and sAPX using a tAPX-I cDNA as a probe (15Yoshimura K. Yabuta Y. Tamoi M. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 223-233Google Scholar). The membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 10 min each at room temperature and in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 60 min. The relative levels of chlAPX transcripts were estimated using a Mac BAS 2000 image scanner (Fuji Photofilm, Tokyo, Japan) and were expressed as the mean values from three independent experiments. RNase protection analysis was carried out according to the instruction manual of the RPAII kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The 3′-terminal region of sAPX-III cDNA was amplified by PCR using a set of primers (sense, 5′-TATGCAGCTGACCAAGAAGCA-3′; antisense, 5′-GGCTTATTAGGGCTACCTCC-3′) and originally cloned into pT7 Blue-T vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The plasmid DNA was linearized with HindIII. The radioactive antisense RNA probe was synthesized with [α-32P]CTP (Amersham Biosciences) using T7 RNA polymerase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) and purified by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide/8 m urea gel. Total RNA was isolated from various tissues of spinach plants as in Northern blot analysis. The RNA probe (about 1 × 105 cpm) was hybridized to 20 μg of spinach total RNA for 12 h. The hybridization mixtures were incubated at 80 °C for 10 min, gradually cooled to 42 °C, and then incubated for 16 h. The mixtures were treated with 0.1 unit of RNase A and 100 units of RNase T1 at 37 °C for 30 min. The protected fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 3.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide/8 m urea gel. The radioactivity of each protected APX mRNA was estimated using a Mac BAS 2000 image scanner (Fuji Photofilm), and the expression ratios of chlAPX mRNA variants were expressed as the mean values from three independent experiments. Various tissues (0.1 g each, FW) of spinach plants were homogenized with SDS-loading buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) as previously described (17Leammli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The homogenates were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were analyzed to determine their protein contents and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE was performed in 12.5% slab gels according to the method of Laemmli (17Leammli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The proteins on the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For immunoblotting, the gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using a semidry electroblotting system (model 200/2.0, Bio-Rad) at 15 V for 1 h. The membrane was incubated with monoclonal antibody (chl-mAb6) raised against spinach sAPX, which reacts with both sAPX and tAPX proteins (18Yoshimura K. ishikawa T. Wada K. Takeda T. Kamata Y. Tada T. Nishimura K. Nakano Y. Shigeoka S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1526: 168-174Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes on the membrane were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). The ratio of expression of sAPX to tAPX proteins was quantified densitometrically and expressed as the mean value from three independent experiments. To amplify a chlAPX-specific partial cDNA fragment from tobacco, degenerate oligonucleotide primers (sense, 5′-TGGCA(C/T)GATGC(C/T)GG(A/T)ACTTA-3′; antisense, 5′-(C/T)TCAT(A/C/G/T)GAATC(C/T)GA(A/C/T)AGCTC-3′) were designed from the common region of the amino acid sequences of tAPX and sAPX from higher plants described previously (4Ishikawa T. Sakai K. Yoshimura K. Takeda T. Shigeoka S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 289-293Google Scholar, 13Mano S. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 309-320Google Scholar). RT-PCR was carried out with poly(A)+ RNA isolated from tobacco leaves as described previously (14Yoshimura K. Yabuta Y. Tamoi M. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 41-48Google Scholar). 5′ and 3′RACE to amplify the full-length cDNAs encoding tAPX and sAPX were carried out using sets of primers corresponding to 5′-upstream (antisense, 5′-TTGTCTTTGATTGGCTGGAG-3′) and 3′-downstream (sense, 5′-AAACTGAGCAACCTTGGAGC-3′) regions of partial cDNA fragments according to the instruction manuals of commercial kits (5′-RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends, Version 2.0 and 3′-RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends, Invitrogen, Rockville, MD). DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain primer method with an automatic DNA sequencer (model 310, PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems, Chiba, Japan). Genomic DNA was isolated from tobacco leaves as described previously (5Ishikawa T. Yoshimura K. Tamoi M. Takeda T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 795-800Google Scholar). PCR of genomic DNA for isolation of the chlAPX gene was carried out using a set of primers (sense, 5′-CCAGAGAAGTTTGTGGCAGC-3′; antisense, 5′-CTCAGTTTCCAAGCAAAGAT-3′) according to the method of Ishikawa et al. (5Ishikawa T. Yoshimura K. Tamoi M. Takeda T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 795-800Google Scholar). The constructs for transformation into cultured tobacco cells were based on pBI121 vector derived from Ti plasmid (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The 3′-terminal region (encoding exons 10–13) ofApxII, which was involved in the alternative splicing events, was amplified by PCR and was placed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in a sense orientation. Transformation of tobacco plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 was performed according to the method of Shikanai et al. (19Shikanai T. Takeda T. Yamauchi H. Sano S. Tomizawa K.

To detect the mRNA variants derived from the transgene in extracts from leaves of transgenic tobacco plants, RT-PCR analysis was carried out with poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the leaves of transgenic tobacco as described previously (14Yoshimura K. Yabuta Y. Tamoi M. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 41-48Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using ReverTra Ace (reverse transcriptase, Toyobo) with an oligo(dT) primer. The PCR reactions were performed using sets of primers (for detection the exogenous chlAPX mRNAs/sense, P-1: 5′-TATGCAGCTGACCAAGAAGC-3′ (located in exon 11); antisense, P-2: 5′-CACAAGAAAATAGCTTCATCTTGC (located in exon 12) or P-3: 5′-ACTGCCAAAACTCCAATCACAATC-3′ (located in exon 13); for detection the endogenous chlAPX mRNAs/sense, P-4: 5′-AAACTGAGCAACCTTGGAGC-3′ (located in exon 11); antisense, P-5: 5′-CTCCTTCATTAGGCTACCAA-3′ (located in exon 12) or P-6: 5′- CTCAGTTTCCAAGCAAAGATGTC-3′ (located in exon 13)) under the following conditions: 27 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The extraction of protein from nuclei was carried out according to Robinson and Hinz (20Robinson D.G. Hinz G. Plant Cell Biology. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York2001: 295-324Google Scholar) with some modifications. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Each tissue (30 g FW) of spinach and tobacco was frozen in liquid N2 and homogenized using a mortar and pestle with 25 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.0, containing 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.3% Triton X-100 (buffer 1). The resulting suspensions were filtered through double layers of a nylon filter (50 μm, Advantec, Tokyo, Japan). The filtrates were centrifuged at 3,300 × gfor 10 min, and the pellets (crude nuclear fractions) were resuspended with 30 ml of buffer 1 without Triton X-100. The suspensions were centrifuged at 3,300 × g for 10 min. The pellets, crude nuclear fractions, were resuspended with 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF; NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5m, and the mixtures were mixed gently for 30 min. After the mixtures were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatants were dialyzed against 3 liters of 20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, containing 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, and 2 mm DTT for 12 h. The dialyzed nuclear protein extracts were then frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The RNA mobility-shift analysis was performed essentially according to Guo et al. (21Guo W. Mulligan G.J. Wormsley S. Helfman D.M. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2096-2107Google Scholar) with some modifications. The 162-bp fragment, including the SRE region, and the 184-bp fragment, including the acceptor site of intron 11 in the chlAPX gene of spinach, were amplified by PCR using the following sets of primers (sense, 5′-TTTTAATAAGCAAGATGAAG-3′; antisense, 5′-GGGCTACCTCCAAAACCTTC-3′; and sense, 5′-CCATGACATTGTTAGATTAT-3′; antisense, 5′-TTTTAGATGTGACTGACTAC-3′; respectively) and originally cloned into pT7 Blue-T vector (Novagen). The plasmid DNAs were linearized with EcoRI. [α-32P]CTP-labeled RNA probes were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (Takara) and purified by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide/8 murea gel. RNA-protein binding reactions were assembled by mixing the extract of nuclear protein (5 μg each) prepared from each tissue in a 50-μl final volume with 32P-labeled RNA (about 1 × 105 cpm), 17 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm EDTA, 17% glycerol, 0.6 mm PMSF, 1.2 mm DTT, 10 units of RNasin, and 5 μg of yeast tRNA. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min and then electrophoresed on 3.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. The RNAs in the gels were visualized with a Mac BAS 2000 image scanner (Fuji Photofilm). Mutation of the SRE region was carried out according to the instruction manual of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA). The mutagenic PCR was performed using PfuTurbo TM DNA polymerase, the mutagenic primer sets (M1, 5′-GTGTTGTGTTGCTATAAAGTTAAAGCAG-3′/5′-CTGCTTTAACTTTATAGCAACACAACAC-3′; M2, 5′-AAACGAGTGTGTA-GAGAAGCATATTTGAATTTGCAG-3′/5′-CTGCAAATTCAAATATGCTTCTCTACACA-CTCGTTT-3′; and M3, 5′-ACGAGTGTGTTGT-GAAGCAATAAAGAATTTGCAG-3′/5′-CTGCAAATTCTTTATTGCTTCACAACACACTCGT-3′), and the 3′-terminal region of ApxII was cloned into pT7 Blue-T vector (Novagen) as a template. The PCR conditions were as follows: 18 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 7 min. The amplified fragment was transformed intoEscherichia coli strain DH5α cells, and a clone of the candidate mutant obtained thereby was isolated and sequenced. To determine whether the transcription level of ApxII varied in several tissues, we analyzed the steady-state transcript levels of total chlAPX mRNA, which were expressed as the sum of the four types of mRNA variants encoding sAPX and tAPX, in the leaves, stems, and roots of mature spinach by Northern blotting using tAPX cDNA as a probe. Interestingly, the chlAPX mRNA variants were expressed at almost equal levels in the leaves, stems, and roots of mature plants (see Fig. 2). Four types of chlAPX mRNA variants, tAPX-I, encoding tAPX, and sAPX-I, -II, and -III, encoding sAPX, were produced by alternative splicing of the 3′-terminal region of chlAPX pre-mRNA (Fig. 1) (14Yoshimura K. Yabuta Y. Tamoi M. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 41-48Google Scholar). Although no difference in the total transcription levels of chlAPX in the various tissues was detected (Fig. 2), it is possible that the efficiency of alternative splicing could have been modulated in each tissue. To examine this possibility, we analyzed the relative levels of expression of four types of mRNA variants in the leaves, stems, and roots of mature spinach plants by RNase protection analysis (Fig. 3). The relative expression ratio of the three types of sAPX mRNAs combined (sAPX-I, -II, and -III) to tAPX mRNA were extremely different depending on the tissue. In leaf, the ratios of sAPX mRNAs compared with tAPX mRNA was about 1 (Fig. 3 C), which was in agreement with the previous result (14Yoshimura K. Yabuta Y. Tamoi M. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 41-48Google Scholar). In contrast to leaf, those of sAPX mRNAs to tAPX mRNA in stem and root were strongly elevated. The elevation of those ratios in both tissues was caused by an increase in sAPX-III and the decrease in tAPX-I. The ratios of sAPX-I and sAPX-II were not altered. Immunoblotting analysis using the monoclonal antibody (chl-mAb6), which reacts specifically with chlAPX isoenzymes in higher plants (18Yoshimura K. ishikawa T. Wada K. Takeda T. Kamata Y. Tada T. Nishimura K. Nakano Y. Shigeoka S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1526: 168-174Google Scholar), showed that the ratios of the expression of sAPX to tAPX in each tissue nearly correlated with the ratios of levels of the respective mRNA variants (Fig. 4). These results clearly indicate that the alternative splicing regulates the relative levels of expression of chlAPX isoenzymes in a tissue-specific manner. To analyze the regulatory mechanism of alternative splicing in higher plants, it is necessary to utilize transgenic technology for the in vivo assay system for splicing. Thus, we isolated the cDNAs and genomic DNA fragment encoding chlAPX isoenzymes from tobacco plants that are suitable for transgenic techniques. Four cDNA clones were obtained by RT-PCR analysis and the 5′/3′RACE technique. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of these clones with the deduced amino acid sequences of spinach chlAPX clearly showed that one of them encoded tAPX and the others encoded the sAPX isoenzymes of tobacco (tAPX; AB022273, sAPX; AB022274) (data not shown). Partial genomic DNA fragments containing 3′-terminal regions of chlAPX isoenzymes were then amplified by genomic PCR and sequenced. By alignment with the previously isolated cDNAs for tobacco chlAPX isoenzymes, the fragment was found to contain three exons corresponding to the 3′-terminal region of chlAPX genes from spinach and pumpkin (Fig. 5). The first exon in the fragment encoding the common sequence of tAPX and sAPX corresponded to exon 11 of spinach ApxII. The second exon, corresponding to the penultimate exon 12 of spinach ApxII, consisted of one codon for Asp before the TAA termination codon and the entire 3′-untranslated region of the sAPX mRNA. The third exon contained the sequence encoding the C-terminal extension with a predicted transmembrane domain, the TGA termination codon, and the entire 3′-untranslated region for tAPX mRNA. These results show that chlAPX isoenzymes in tobacco are produced by the alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA, as are those of spinach ApxII, which is in agreement with the results found in spinach and pumpkin (5Ishikawa T. Yoshimura K. Tamoi M. Takeda T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 795-800Google Scholar, 6Mano S. Yamaguchi K. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 21-26Google Scholar, 14Yoshimura K. Yabuta Y. Tamoi M. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 41-48Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that the tobacco plant becomes a good tool for the in vivoanalysis of the alternative splicing mechanism as described below. The significant structural differences among the four spliced mRNA variants of chlAPX are associated with the alternative splicing of the 3′-terminal region consisting of intron 11 to exon 13 of the gene (ApxII). This view suggests that an essential regulatory factor such as a cis element for alternative splicing is present within the 3′-terminal region. Fig. 5 shows a comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the 3′-terminal regions (exons 11 to 13) of the chlAPX genes in spinach (5Ishikawa T. Yoshimura K. Tamoi M. Takeda T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 795-800Google Scholar), tobacco (this study), and pumpkin (6Mano S. Yamaguchi K. Hayashi M. Nishimura M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 21-26Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found a common sequence with a high homology in introns 11 and 12 among the three chlAPX genes. On the other hand, the other upstream introns (introns 1 through 10), which were spliced out constitutively, showed no significant homology (data not shown). Furthermore, the region immediately upstream of the acceptor site in intron 12 was highly conserved in the three genes. These facts suggest that the common region may be a ciselement involved in regulating the tissue-specific alternative splicing, and thus we designated this region as a putative splicing regulatory element (SRE, bold line in Fig. 5). It seemed likely that the SRE region acts as a cis element that regulates the alternative splicing of chlAPX isoenzymes. Therefore, the effect of SRE on the efficiency of the alternative splice site selection in vivo was investigated using transformed tobacco plants. The truncated 3′-terminal regions of spinach ApxIIwere placed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter of pBI121 vector (pBI/chlAPX3′SRE, Fig. 6 A). The mutant constructs (pBI/chlAPX3′ΔSRE and pBI/chlAPX3′mutSRE), which deleted the middle 10 bases of the SRE sequence and partially substituted the SRE sequence, respectively, in pBI/chlAPX3′SRE, were also prepared. However, the sequence of the acceptor site of the intron 12 (-GAATTTGCAG/AGATCA-) remained in these mutants, because the SRE was close to this site. The transgenes were transformed into tobacco plants by the A. tumefaciens infection method (19Shikanai T. Takeda T. Yamauchi H. Sano S. Tomizawa K. Yokota A. Shigeoka S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 47-51Google Scholar). The transgenic tobacco plants were selected, and the splicing efficiency of chlAPX pre-mRNA derived from the transgene in the leaf was analyzed by RT-PCR as described previously (14Yoshimura K. Yabuta Y. Tamoi M. Ishikawa T. Shigeoka S. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 41-48Google Scholar). No amplified band was detected in tobacco transformed with the control vector (pBI/GUS, β-glucuronidase) (Fig. 6 B). On the other hand, many amplified bands, which were in agreement with the findings in spinach plants as a control, were detected in the leaf of pBI/chlAPX3′SRE-transformed tobacco plants. By the DNA sequencing analysis, these bands were found to correspond to the four mRNA variants (sAPX-I, -II, -III, and tAPX-I mRNAs) derived from the transgene, although large amounts of unspliced pre-mRNAs were also detected (Fig. 6 B). This result suggests that the processing of the truncated pre-mRNA by the mRNA processing system occurs, including the alternative"

We found that cobalt stress specifically results in an immediate and dramatic induction of genes involved in iron uptake. This response is dependent on the Aft1 protein, a transcriptional factor known to regulate a set of genes involved in iron uptake and homeostasis (iron regulon). Like iron starvation, cobalt stress induces accumulation of the Aft1 protein in the nucleus to activate transcription of its target genes. Cells lacking the AFT1 gene (aft1) are hypersensitive to cobalt as well as to other transition metals, whereas expression of the dominant AFT1–1 up allele, which results in up-regulation of AFT1-controlled genes, confers resistance. Cobalt resistance correlates with an increase in intracellular iron in AFT1–1 up cells, and sensitivity of aft1 cells is associated with a lack of iron accumulation. Furthermore, elevated iron levels in the growth medium suppress the cobalt sensitivity of the aft1 mutant cells, even though they increase cellular cobalt. Results presented indicate that yeast cells acquire cobalt tolerance by activating the Aft1p-dependent iron regulon and thereby increasing intracellular iron levels.

Science. 1994; 264: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and various other enzymes in animals, yeasts, bacteria, Archaea, and plants (2Kobayashi M. Shimizu S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), exposure to inorganic cobalt is associated with various human diseases such as contact dermitis (3Barceloux D.G. J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. 1999; 37: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), allergic asthma leading to subsequent interstitial fibrosis (4Lauwerys R. Lison D. Sci.

Exposure of humans to cobalt is widespread; cobalt compounds are used in many industrial processes such as refining and production of alloys, jet engines and gas turbines, electrochemical materials, and permanent magnets. Furthermore, cobalt is used in drying agents for lacquers and in varnishes, paints, inks, catalysts, ceramics, pigments, and surgical implants, and mineral supplements for pasture lands often carry cobalt salts (6Beyersmann D. Hartwig A. Toxicol. Appl.

Cobalt increases oxidative stress in cells by raising the concentration of reactive oxygen species (9Kasprzak K. Chem. Res.

Health Perspect. 1981; 40: 233-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In molecular biology, cobalt, like iron chelators, is frequently used as a tool to mimic hypoxia. Cobalt stimulates, as does hypoxia, the production of erythropoietin, a glycoprotein hormone essential for the differentiation of red blood cells in response to hypoxia. There is evidence that the cellular oxygen-sensing mechanism, present in most if not all tissues, utilizes a heme protein where cobalt might substitute for the iron in the porphyrin ring, thereby decreasing its affinity to oxygen and mimicking a hypoxic environment (13Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 14Bunn H.F., Gu, J. Huang L.E. Park J.W. Zhu H. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 8: 1197-1201Google Scholar). The notion that iron and cobalt compete for this heme protein is supported by the fact that cells grown in low-iron medium require less cobalt for erythropoietin stimulation than those exposed to iron-rich medium (15Ho V.T. Bunn H.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To understand the cellular response to cobalt stress and screen for genes involved in cobalt detoxification, we determined the transcriptional profile of Saccharomyces cerevisiae upon cobalt exposure. We found that the iron regulon, in particular, genes dependent on the transcriptional factor Aft1p, plays a vital role in cellular cobalt tolerance. The 77.7-kDa protein Aft1p has been shown to be transported into the nucleus upon iron starvation to mediate iron-regulated transcription by binding to the consensus motif PyPuCACCCPu in the 5′-upstream region of a number of genes involved in iron transport and homeostasis (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

Whereas aft1 mutant cells are unable to switch on the iron regulon upon cobalt stress and appear sensitive to cobalt, permanent induction of these genes (via theAFT1–1 up allele) leads to cobalt resistance. Cellular iron levels coincide with cobalt tolerance; iron is decreased in aft1 disrupted cells and increased inAFT1–1 up cells, and in addition, the wild-type shows elevated iron concentrations upon cobalt stress. Furthermore, high external iron can restore cobalt tolerance of the aft1disrupted cells. Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Stratagene) and the following plasmids were used: YEp351HA (19Bui D.M. Gregan J.

To create theaft1::TRP1 mutant JS018, JS034-4C cells were transformed with the 4.0-kb XhoI/SacI fragment of plasmid pT20 (22Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner A.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) carrying the aft1 gene withTRP1 insertion. The disruption was verified using analytical PCR (data not shown). To overexpress C-terminally HA1-tagged Cot1p, theCOT1 gene was PCR-amplified from FY1679 chromosomal DNA using the mutagenic oligonucleotide primers COT1-PstI/XbaI (5′-CCCCCTGCAGTCTAGACTCAGCACTTTCTACATT-3′) and COT1-PstI (5′-CCCCCTGCAGGATGATCCTCTAAGCAATC-3′), starting at positions −425 and +2008, respectively, relative to the COT1 coding sequence, and introducing PstI and XbaI sites (underlined). The product was digested with PstI and XbaI and then ligated to the PstI and XbaI linearized vector YEp351HA to obtain the 7.5-kb vector YEpCOT1HA. To clone pVTUCOT1–1HA,the HA-tagged COT1 was amplified from YEpCOT1HA using the primers COT1-X (5′-CTAGTCTAGAATAGTTCTGCATAGC-3′) and COT1-H (5′-CAGTGCCAAGCTTTCAGC-3′) located at −61 and +1432, respectively, relative to the COT1 open reading frame and featuring a XbaI and a HindIII site, respectively (underlined). The PCR product was digested withXbaI and HindIII and cloned into pVT102-U, placing the COT1 gene behind the constitutive pADH1promoter. Cells were fixed and stained with antibodies as described previously (24Nasmith K. Adolf G. Lydall D. Seddon G. Cell. 1990; 62: 631-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were mouse anti-HA (19Bui D.M. Gregan J. Jarosch E. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol.

Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA was visualized by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence microscopy was done with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope and a Visitron Systems Imaging system. Cells grown in YPD medium at 28 °C to A 600 = 0.5–0.6 were treated with 100 μm to 2 mmCoCl2 or with 80 μm BPS (Sigma) for 30 or 90 min at 28 °C, and then the cells were harvested, and RNA was prepared essentially according to the hot acidic phenol method (25Ausubel F.M.

The yeast DNA chips were obtained from the Ontario Cancer Institute Microarray Centre. Reverse transcription, probe cleanup, and microarray hybridization were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Microarrays were read using an Axon GenePix 4000B laser scanner (Axon Instruments) and analyzed using GenePix Pro 3.0 software. The SaccharomycesGenome Data Base, Yeast Proteome Data Base, and Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences data base were used to extract information on Co2+-responsive genes. Cells grown in YPD medium at 28 °C toA 600 = 0.5–0.6 and then incubated with 2 mm CoCl2, 1.5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm NiSO4, or 10 mmZnCl2 for 60 min at 28 °C were harvested, and RNA was prepared (25Ausubel F.M.

Northern blotting and hybridization (25 μg of RNA each) were performed (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) and analyzed using an Amersham Biosciences Typhoon 8600 phosphorimaging system. Probes were generated by PCR from chromosomal DNA (JS034-4C) using [γ-32P]ATP and oligonucleotide primers FET3-f (5′-TGGGCTAAAGAGCCGTCC-3′), FET3-r (5′-CCGTCGATTTCGACCACG-3′), FIT1-f (5′-TCGCTGCAACGTCTGCTG-3′), FIT1-r (5′-AGTTGCAACGGTGGAGGC-3′), ACT1-f (5′-ACCAAGAGAGGTATCTTGACTTTACG-3′), and ACT1-r (5′-GACATCGACATCACACTTCATGATGG-3′). Cells grown in YPD medium at 28 °C to A 600 = 0.5–0.6 were incubated with CoCl2 or FeCl2 for 90 min. Cells were harvested, washed twice with high pressure liquid chromatography-grade water (atomic absorption spectrophotometry) or 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA (inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrophotometry), and then dried at 105 °C for 120 min. Upon determination of the dry weight, the pellet was digested in 65% HNO3 at 90 °C for 30 min. Ions were quantified using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 5100PC Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (Fe) or PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sciex ELAN 6100 inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrophotometry (Fe, Co). To follow the genomic response to Co2+, early logarithmic yeast wild-type cells (JS034-4C) grown in liquid YPD medium were either stressed with 100 μm CoCl2 for 30 min or stressed with 2 mm CoCl2 for 30 and 90 min. Whereas 100 μm Co2+ represents mild, subtoxic Co2+ stress that does not affect the growth of yeast wild-type cells, 2 mm Co2+ causes a 50% reduction of growth rates (data not shown).

The protein sequence deduced from the YLR205 gene shows similarity to the mammalian heme oxygenases 1 and 2. Six additional genes up-regulated by 2 mm Co2+but not by 100 μm Co2+ contain consensus Aft1p binding sites (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) in their 5′-non-translated region (highlighted in Table I). COT1 is involved in cellular Co2+accumulation and confers Co2+ resistance when overexpressed (36Conklin D.S. McMaster J.A. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3678-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). PCL5 is a G1 cyclin gene (37Measday V. Moore L. Retnakaran R. Lee J. Donoviel M. Neiman A.M. Andrews B. Mol. Cell.

YPL250 contains in its 5′-non-translated region two zinc responsive elements in addition to three AFT1 recognition motifs (38Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). None of the genes known to be AFT1-dependent or possessing AFT1 recognition motifs in their promoter regions and found here to be transcriptionally regulated upon Co2+stress in the wild-type were up-regulated upon Co2+ stress applied to JS018 aft1-null mutant cells (Table I). High Co2+ (2 mm), but not the subtoxic concentration of 100 μm, was found to stimulate expression of a series of other genes (Table I). Most of them are involved in stress response, amino acid synthesis pathways (particularly arginine and methionine), and vacuolar degradation. Only a few genes were significantly down-regulated upon Co2+ stress within 90 min (Table I). The GLT1(glutamate synthase), ACO1 (aconitate hydratase), andLEU1 (isopropylmalate isomerase) genes code for proteins containing iron-sulfur clusters. To induce mild iron depletion, the cell-impermeable chelator BPS was added to wild-type cells (JS034-4C) to a final concentration of 80 μm 90 min before harvest. The expressional response of yeast upon iron depletion was strikingly similar to the immediate response observed upon mild Co2+ stress (30 min, 100 μmCoCl2). Genes significantly induced by BPS were the siderophore transporters ARN1 and ARN3 and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoproteins FIT2 andFIT3 (Table I). ARN2, FET3, andFIT1 showed slight (±S.D. > 1.5) induction (data not shown). To determine whether the cellular iron content is altered in response to Co2+ stress, cells were grown in YPD medium to mid-log phase and stressed with 2 mm CoCl2 for 90 min. Total cellular iron contents of the CoCl2-treated cells and untreated control cells were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Fig. 1). In wild-type cells (JS034-4C), iron was increased 2-fold upon Co2+stress, consistent with Co2+-induced up-regulation of the iron transport genes as observed in the microarray experiments.aft1 mutant cells (JS018) exhibited 2.3 times lower total cellular iron than wild-type cells and failed to accumulate iron when stressed with Co2+. This is consistent with earlier findings that the aft1-null mutant was found to exhibit a lower iron uptake rate than wild-type cells (39Lesuisse E. Simon-Casteras M. Labbe P. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3455-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cells expressing the dominant AFT1–1 up allele (JS034-4C pT14), which promotes iron-independent permanent transcription ofAFT1-regulated genes, contained 3.8 times more iron than wild-type cells. No significant further increase in cellular iron was observed when AFT1–1 up cells were stressed with Co2+. Taken together, Co2+ stress apparently induces overaccumulation of iron via an Aft1p-controlled process. Because the iron-dependent regulation of the Aft1p transcriptional factor is mediated by its subcellular localization, i.e. cytoplasmic localization in iron-replete cells and redirection to the nucleus in iron-depleted cells (18Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining whether high Co2+ was capable of directing Aft1p to the nucleus. Cells carrying HA-tagged Aft1p (pRS416-AFT1-HA), grown in YPD medium or exposed to 2 mm CoCl2 for 90 min, were subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy. Correlating with the activation of Aft1p target genes upon Co2+ stress (TableI), Aft1p was localized in the cytoplasm at standard conditions (Fig.2, − Co) and directed to the nucleus by Co2+ (Fig. 2, + Co). To investigate the role of the AFT1 gene product in metal ion tolerance, various strains were compared for their ability to grow on elevated ion levels. As shown in Fig. 3, theaft1-null mutant was hypersensitive to Co2+, whereas the dominant AFT1–1 up allele conferred moderate resistance to elevated Co2+ levels. Whereasaft1 mutant cells were also sensitive to iron depletion (BPS), increased levels of Zn2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+, and elevated temperature (37 °C), the AFT1–1 up allele conferred slight resistance to iron limitation and increased Zn2+ and Ni2+ concentrations in the media. Because expression of the Cot1 protein, which is known to be important for cellular Co2+ tolerance (see Refs. 36Conklin D.S. McMaster J.A. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3678-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar and 40Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), appeared to be Aft1p-dependent (the COT1 gene has one Aft1p consensus binding motif in the 5′ upstream region), we overexpressed Cot1p in the aft1 strain by the constitutive pADH1 promoter from the multicopy vector pVTU-COT1HA. Whereas COT1 overexpression conferred Co2+tolerance to wild-type cells (data not shown), it was not sufficient to suppress sensitivity of the aft1 disrupted cells to Co2+ or any other stress condition tested (Fig. 3). Becauseaft1 mutant cells appeared sensitive not only to Co2+ but also to other metal ions, we examined whether Mn2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+ is also capable of up-regulating the iron regulon. Northern analysis was performed to follow expression of the Aft1p target genes FET3 andFIT1 (28Protchenko O. Ferea T. Rashford J. Tiedeman J. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49244-49250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S., Li, L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) upon exposure to these metal ions.FET3 expression was highly induced by Co2+ (Fig.4), but not by Mn2+ or Ni2+, whereas Zn2+ also slightly inducedFET3. FIT1 appeared to be up-regulated by Co2+ only and not by Mn2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+. Consequently, consistent with microarray studies (data not shown), Co2+, but not Mn2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+, specifically induces the iron regulon. To find out whether Co2+ hypersensitivity of the aft1 mutant cells may be a consequence of intracellular iron shortage and of their inability to increase cellular iron upon exposure to Co2+, we assayed changes in growth as well as cellular iron and cobalt concentrations of aft1cells (JS018) when cells were stressed with 90 μmCoCl2 in the presence or absence of 2 mmFeCl2. At 90 μm CoCl2, growth ofaft1 cells was severely reduced (Fig.5, ⋄), and cellular cobalt increased dramatically (Table II). 2 mmFeCl2 in the growth medium highly increased cellular iron (Table II) but did not affect growth (Fig. 5, ▴). When 90 μm CoCl2 was provided in addition to 2 mm FeCl2, the aft1 mutant was no longer inhibited by Co2+ (Fig. 5, ♦). Surprisingly, cellular cobalt was even 3-fold increased as compared with mere addition of 90 μm CoCl2 (Table II). This indicates (i) that high iron levels in the medium alone can compensate for the loss of induction of iron transporters (aft1) in cobalt tolerance and (ii) that high iron does not override cobalt toxicity by competition in uptake, but rather intracellularly.Table IITotal cellular cobalt and iron contents of aft1 cells upon addition of cobalt and ironFe (ppm)Co (ppm)−−<10<0.3−Fe976.0 ± 84.0<0.3Co−<1062.2 ± 4.5CoFe1081.7 ± 194.1188.5 ± 36.9JS018 (aft1::TRP1) cells were grown in YPD medium to A 600 = 0.5, and then CoCl2 and FeCl2 (90 μm and 2 mm final concentrations, respectively) were added when indicated.

PAI-1 is linked to several processes in the metastatic cascade. However, the role of PAI-1 in metastatic processes, which may be independent of protease inhibitory activity, is not fully understood. We report herein that PAI-1, when added exogenously to or stably transfected in human MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells, had disparate effects on adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and motility in vitro. Specifically, exogenously added PAI-1 inhibited cell adhesion to vitronectin but not fibronectin, in agreement with the literature. By contrast, stably transfected PAI-1 stimulated adhesion to both proteins. Wild-type PAI-1 was required for this stimulation, because expression of a non-protease inhibitory P14 (T333R) PAI-1 mutant failed to enhance adhesion. Compared with non-inhibitory PAI-1, wild-type PAI-1 also increased cell motility in chemotaxic assays. Furthermore, stable transfection of a related serine protease inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-3 (PAI-3, or protein C inhibitor) gave results similar to wild-type PAI-1. The stimulatory activity of PAI-3 was not seen with a non-protease inhibitory P14 PAI-3 mutant (T341R). We show that a downstream effect of endogenous wild-type PAI-1 and PAI-3 overexpression, but not their non-inhibitory counterparts, was the altered expression of α2, α3, α4, α5, and β1 integrin subunits. Additionally, blocking antibodies to β1integrin inhibited PAI-1-induced adhesion. Our data provide experimental support for the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of PAI-1 in metastasis and introduce PAI-3 as another serpin potentially important in malignant disease.

PAI-1, the primary inhibitor of the plasminogen activator system, inactivates urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), but it also has a role in cell adhesion and migration. Several studies have shown that PAI-1 expression in breast and other types of cancer is linked with a poor prognosis (6Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J.

Simonsen A.C. Andersen J. Overgaard J. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 932-940Google Scholar). Identification of the biological function of PAI-1 in cancer is complicated by findings that PAI-1 can act independently of its protease inhibitory activity. PAI-1 inhibits in vitroadhesion of multiple cell lines to the extracellular matrix protein, vitronectin (VN) (9Deng G. Curriden S. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Google Scholar). PAI-1 binds VN (10Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Google Scholar), and this PAI-1-VN interaction blocks cell integrin (αvβ3 and αvβ5) adhesion to VN (11Stefansson S. Lawrence D. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Google Scholar). The uPA receptor (uPAR) can also bind VN and has been identified as an integrin-independent cell surface VN receptor (9Deng G. Curriden S. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Google Scholar). Although PAI-1 and uPAR both share N-terminal binding sites on VN (10Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Google Scholar), PAI-1 has a higher affinity for VN, and consequently, competitively inhibits cell uPAR-VN binding (12Waltz D. Natkin L. Fujita R. Wei Y. Chapman H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 58-67Google Scholar). Deng et al. (9Deng G. Curriden S. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Google Scholar) proposed that increased PAI-1 could release cells bound to VN by uPAR and promote cell dissemination, possibly explaining the role of PAI-1 in a metastatic disease process. In addition to the adhesive interactions, there is increasing evidence that PAI-1 can mediate cell migration (12Waltz D. Natkin L. Fujita R. Wei Y. Chapman H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 58-67Google Scholar, 13Kjoller L. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T. Rodenburg K.W. Ronne E. Goodman S.L. Preissner K.T. Ossowski L. Andreasen P.A. Exp.

PAI-1 has been shown to either inhibit or stimulate cell migration on VN. Kjoller et al. (13Kjoller L. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T. Rodenburg K.W. Ronne E. Goodman S.L. Preissner K.T. Ossowski L. Andreasen P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 420-429Google Scholar) added exogenous PAI-1 to a modified Boyden chamber migration assay in which the filters were coated with VN and found that active PAI-1 bound to VN, blocked uPAR and integrin binding, and subsequently blocked migration of human epidermoid carcinoma Hep-2 cells. By contrast, Stahl and Mueller (15Stahl A. Mueller B.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 116-122Google Scholar) found that exogenous PAI-1 stimulated melanoma cell migration on VN. It is unclear why exogenous PAI-1 had opposing effects in each of the studies, but the differences may be associated with differences in assay conditions, cell specificity, or protein conformation. PAI-3 is synthesized in the liver and in numerous steroid-responsive organs. PAI-3 antigen has been detected in saliva, cerebral spinal fluid, amniotic fluid, tears, and semen (4, 17Laurell M.A. Christensson A.P. Abrhamsson P.A. Stenflo J. Liljs H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1094-1101Google Scholar, 18Espana F. Gilabert J. Estelles A. Romue A. Aznar J. Cabo A. Thromb. Res. 1991; 64: 309-320Google Scholar, 19Espana F. Estelles A. Fernandez P. Gilabert J. Sanchez-Cuenca J. Griffin J. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 70: 989-994Google Scholar). In contrast to PAI-1, PAI-3 inhibits a broad array of proteases, including uPA, tPA, activated protein C, thrombin (free and bound to thrombomodulin), and acrosin (19Espana F. Estelles A. Fernandez P. Gilabert J. Sanchez-Cuenca J. Griffin J. Thromb. Haemost. 1993; 70: 989-994Google Scholar, 20Suzuki K. Nishioka J. Hashimoto S. J. Biol.

PAI-3, whose expression is increased in prostate cancer, also inhibits prostatic glandular kallikreins, suggesting that it may be linked to carcinogenesis in hormone-regulated tissues (17Laurell M.A. Christensson A.P. Abrhamsson P.A. Stenflo J. Liljs H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1094-1101Google Scholar,24Mikolajczyk S.D. Millar L.S. Kumar A. Saedi M.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 438-442Google Scholar). PAI-3 is found in many hormone-responsive tissues, is a uPA inhibitor, and can be localized to malignant breast tissue. The biological significance of a cancer expressing PAI-3 rather than other related serpins (PAI-1, PAI-2, or maspin) that have been implicated in various tumor cell biology processes is unknown (6Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Google Scholar, 7Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the role of PAI-1 in cell adhesion and motility would be independent of its ability to inhibit serine proteases. Because PAI-3 also inhibits uPA but does not bind VN, it was used to compare and contrast to the interactions of PAI-1. We established stably transfected MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells expressing wild-type and non-inhibitory mutants of PAI-1 and PAI-3 and characterized their biological properties. In contrast to our initial hypothesis, what we report here is that changes in adhesion, integrin expression, and cell migration of MDA-MB-435 cells was dependent on expression of wild-type PAI-1 and PAI-3 and was not observed from their non-inhibitory serpin counterparts. These results suggest that expression of PAI-1 and PAI-3 may render a tumor cell better able to invade and may partly explain the association of PAI-1 with metastatic disease. MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells and the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hep G2 were obtained from the University of North Carolina Tissue Culture Facility. Cells were maintained as monolayer culture in minimal essential media (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% sodium pyruvate in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. MDA-MB-435 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 vectors (Invitrogen) containing wt-PAI-1 (1Ginsburg D. Zehab R. Yang A.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1673-1680Google Scholar), P14-PAI-1 (T333R), wt-PAI-3 (25Phillips J.E. Cooper S.T. Potter E.E. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16696-16700Google Scholar), or P14-PAI-3 (T341R) using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Stably transfected clones were selected for resistance to the neomycin analogue, G418 (Invitrogen). Total RNA was isolated from the MDA-MB-435 cells and HepG2 cells using RNeasy (Qiagen). Two micrograms of RNA was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's recommendations. cDNA was amplified with each cycle consisting of a 1-min denaturation step at 94 °C, a 1-min annealing step at a primer-specific temperature (given in parentheses below for each primer set), and a 1-min elongation step at 72 °C. A pre-amplification denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min and a post-amplification elongation at 72 °C for 5 min were also included. The primer sequences were: PAI-1 (61 °C), sense 5′-AATCAGACGGCAGCACTGTC-3′, antisense 5′-CTGAACATGTCGGTCATTCC-3′; PAI-3 (55 °C), sense 5′-AGCAGGTGGAGAATGCACTGACTC-3′, antisense 5′-CCTGTTGAACACTAGCCTCTGAGAG-3′; uPA (55 °C), sense 5′GGCAGCAATGAACTTCATCAAGTTCC-3′, antisense 5′-TATTTCACAGTGCTGCCCTCCG-3′; tPA (60 °C), sense 5′-CCAGCAACATCAGTCATGGC-3′, antisense 5′-GCACTTCCCAGCAAATCCTTC-3′; uPAR (60 °C), sense 5′-ACAGGAGCTGCCCTCGCGAC-3′ and antisense 5′-GAGGGGGATTTCAGGTTTAGG-3′; annexin-II, sense 5′-TGCTTTGAACATTGAAACAGA-3′ and antisense 5′-TCTTGCTGGATATAATAGTAC-3′; and β-actin (55 °C), sense 5′-ATCATGTTTGAGACCTTCAA-3′ and antisense 5′-CATCTCTTGCTCGAAGTCCA-3′. Cells were plated at a density of 20,000/12 mm2 on sterile glass coverslips and allowed to adhere in normal growth media containing 10% FBS for 4 h, washed 1× with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated overnight in serum-free MEM. Cells were fixed to the coverslips with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized with a 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer containing 300 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2 for 5 min on ice. Cells were blocked in 10% normal serum from the same species as the secondary antibody for 30 min. Staining was performed at room temperature for 1 h with the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-human PAI-1 (Molecular Innovations, Southfield, MI) and mouse monoclonal anti-human PAI-3 (G4–2, prepared in our laboratory). Biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) were used in conjunction with the Vectastain ABC Kit for detection. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. ELISAs were used to determine the concentration of PAI-1 or PAI-3 protein secreted by the transfected cells. A PAI-1 Imulyse kit (BioPool International) and PAI-3 Paired Antibody Sandwich ELISA kit (Affinity Biologicals) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight well tissue culture plates were coated with VN (BD Bioscience), FN (BD Bioscience), or LN (BD Bioscience) at a concentration of 10 μg/well at 37 °C for 1 h. All plates were rinsed with PBS and blocked with 1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were again rinsed with PBS and air-dried. Cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in 200 μl of serum-free medium and allowed to attach for 1 h at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed with a multi-channel pipette, and adhered cells were gently washed twice with PBS. An MTT assay was performed to quantify the number of adhered cells (26Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Meth. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of 5 μg/ml MTT in serum-free MEM was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. All MTT solution was removed, and 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to solubilize the formazan crystals for 20 min at 37 °C. Samples were transferred to a 96-well plate, and the absorbance was measured at 600 nm in a V maxmicrotiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). In the competition studies for MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion to VN and FN surfaces, human wt-rPAI-1 was from Molecular Innovations, and human plasma PAI-3 was from Affinity Biologicals. For F-actin staining, cells were plated at a density of 20,000/12 mm2 on sterile glass coverslips previously coated with either VN or FN. The coverslips were coated according to the above-mentioned procedure for 48-well plates. Cells were allowed to adhere in the absence of serum for 1 h at 37 °C. After gently removing the non-adherent cells, coverslips were fixed as described above. Cells were stained with FITC-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes) at a 1:200 dilution in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (1:40,000, Molecular Probes) for 1 min at room temperature. Coverslips were rinsed in PBS and mounted with 50% glycerol in PBS. Half a million cells were washed with PBS containing 1% BSA by centrifuging at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were incubated with 100 μl of an anti-human integrin antibody solution diluted with PBS containing 1% BSA at a dilution of 1:50, on ice for 1 h. The monoclonal anti-human integrin antibody was either anti-α1 (mAB1973, Chemicon), anti-α2 (clone P1E6, Invitrogen), anti-α3 (clone P1B5, Invitrogen), anti-α4 (clone P4G9, Invitrogen), anti-α5(clone P1D6, Invitrogen), anti-α6 (clone GoH3, BD Pharmingen), anti-αv (clone VNR139 or VNR147, Invitrogen), anti-β1 (clone P4C10, Invitrogen), anti-β3 (clone 25E11, Chemicon), or anti-β4(clone 3E1, Invitrogen). Cells were then washed three times with PBS containing 1% BSA and incubated with 100 μl ofR-phycoerythrin-anti-mouse IgG in PBS containing 1% BSA at a dilution of 1:100 on ice for 45 min. The cells were washed as described above and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. To assess background staining, cells were labeled with only the secondary antibody, omitting the primary antibody. The threshold for an event in flow cytometric analysis was kept at 5%. A total of 1.5 × 104 events were counted for each sample. Listmode files were replayed for data analysis by using WinMDI 2.7 software. Production of uPA protein in the wt- and P14-PAI-1-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells was determined essentially as described by Ma et al. (27Ma Z. Webb D.J., Jo, M. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3387-3396Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells that constitutively express uPA were used as a positive control. From confluent cultures of wt- and P14-PAI-1-expressing MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 cells, 30 μg of total protein (by Bradford assay) from each cell type was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a uPA-specific monoclonal antibody (#390 from American Diagnostica, Inc.) followed by anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate. Secondary antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Experiments were conducted using BioCoat® culture inserts (BD Bioscience) with an 8-μm diameter pore size membrane in a 24-well companion plate. For chemotaxis (CTX), VN or FN (50 μg/ml) was diluted in serum-free media with 0.1% BSA (750 μl) and added to each well of the plate. Cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells (500 μl) in the culture insert in serum-free medium with 0.1% BSA and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. For haptotaxis (HTX), the lower surfaces of the culture inserts were coated with VN or FN (50 μg/ml) in serum-free medium with 0.1% BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. Inserts were then rinsed with PBS and air-dried. Cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells (500 μl) in the culture insert in serum-free media with 0.1% BSA, and the same medium was added to the plate. Cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. After the incubation period for both the CTX and HTX experiments, the media was removed from the insert, and cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by “scrubbing” the membrane with a cotton-tipped applicator. Cells that migrated to the lower surface of the membranes were fixed to the membrane with 100% methanol for 5 min. Inserts were then washed with PBS and stained with Hoechst (Molecular Probes) diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml for 2 min. The membranes were excised from the insert, inverted, and mounted on glass microscope slides. The total number of nuclei was counted in each of three fields at 40× magnification using UV fluorescence microscopy. Statistical analysis was performed using InStat, GraphPad Software, Inc. A one-way analysis of variance test was used followed by a Dunnett multiple comparison test or Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison analysis when appropriate. Exogenous PAI-1 can bind to VN and release cells bound to this substratum (9Deng G. Curriden S. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Google Scholar). We confirmed this interaction in adhesion experiments when exogenous wt-rPAI-1 and MDA-MB-435 were added to a VN coated plate at the same time, wt-rPAI-1 inhibited cell adhesion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1, upper panel). The addition of wt-rPAI-1 (50 nm) blocked MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion to VN by ∼50%. A PAI-1 blocking antibody added at the same time as the wt-rPAI-1 restored cell adhesion to approximately that of the untreated control cells, and exogenous wt-rPAI-1 did not block cell adhesion to FN, because PAI-1 does not bind FN (data not shown). Because PAI-3 lacks a VN binding site (28Neese L.L. Pratt C.W. Church F.C. Blood Coag. Fibrinol. 1994; 5: 737-746Google Scholar), exogenous PAI-3 should not affect cell adhesion to VN. Confirming this prediction, in adhesion experiments when exogenous wt-PAI-3 was added with MDA-MB-435 cells at the time of plating, there was no effect on cell adhesion either to VN (Fig. 1, lower panel) or to FN (data not shown). To test the effect of endogenously expressed plasminogen activator inhibitors on tumor cell adhesion and motility, MDA-MB-435 cells were stably transfected with PAI-1 and PAI-3. The parental MDA-MB-435 cells lack endogenous gene expression of PAI-1 and PAI-3 making them ideal candidates for evaluating a role for these serpins in cancer cells (Fig. 2). MDA-MB-435 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vectors containing either wt-PAI-1, P14-PAI-1, wt-PAI-3, or P14-PAI-3 genes. At least two clones were derived for each vector. Expression of the transfected genes and protein production was verified by rtPCR (Fig. 2,upper panel) and by immunoblot (data not shown). Protein expression was also detected by immunofluorescent staining for PAI-1 in clone 1 of wt-transfected and clone 2 of P14-PAI-1-transfected cells, and for clone 2 and clone 1 for wt and P14-PAI-3, respectively (Fig. 2,lower panel). There was no visible difference in protein localization between wt- and P14-expressing clones for PAI-1 or PAI-3, respectively. In non-permeabilized transfected MDA-MB-435 cells, immunofluorescent staining verified that both PAI-1 and PAI-3 were localized to the cell surface (data not shown). By ELISA, wt-PAI-1-expressing clone 1 and P14-PAI-1-expressing clone 2 secreted 12 and 8.0 μg/ml protein per 1 × 106cells, respectively. By ELISA, wt-PAI-3-expressing clone 2 and P14-PAI-3-expressing clone 1 secreted 6.1 and 8.4 μg/ml of protein per 1 × 106 cells, respectively. The P14-PAI-1- and P14-PAI-3-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells represent a population that was not only subjected to the same transfection method and antibiotic resistant selection as the wild-type population for both PAI-1- and PAI-3-expressing cells, but the P14 populations were transfected with an identical vector and gene sequence with the exception of a single nucleotide. Thus, changes in phenotype between the various PAI-1/PAI-3-expressing MDA-MB-435 clones should reflect biological differences between wild-type active and mutant non-inhibitory serpin effects on the MDA-MB-435 cells. Unexpectedly, we found that wt-PAI-1-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells adhered to both VN and FN 2- to 3-fold better than P14-PAI-1 and untransfected MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig.3, upper panel). Similarly, we found that adhesion of wt-PAI-3-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells increased 3- to 4-fold to both VN and FN compared with P14-PAI-3 and control MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 3, lower panel). Adhesion experiments were also performed with laminin (LN) and type I collagen as the substratum. Cell adhesion to LN (Fig. 3) and type I collagen (data not shown) was significantly increased for both the wt-PAI-1- and wt-PAI-3-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells but not for their non-inhibitory P14 counterparts. In control experiments, cell adhesion to tissue culture-treated plastic or to poly-l-lysine-coated plastic was similar between the wt-PAI-1, P14-PAI-1, wt-PAI-3, P14-PAI-3, or untransfected MDA-MB-435 cells. Additionally, six clones of wt-PAI-1-expressing cells isolated and cloned in a separate transfection experiment also adhered to both VN and FN 2- to 3-fold better than untransfected control MDA-MB-435 cells (data not shown). In adhesion experiments when exogenous wt-rPAI-1 (50 nm) was added to either PAI-1- or PAI-3-expressing MDA-MB-435 cell clones, adhesion was blocked by an average of 40% for wild-type and P14 populations (Fig. 4). Although wt-PAI-1- and wt-PAI-3-expressing cells showed 2- to 4-fold increased adhesion compared with untransfected MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 4), the addition of exogenous wt-rPAI-1 at time of plating can still bind VN and reduce cell adhesion compared with PAI-1- and PAI-3-expressing cells plated in the absence of exogenous wt-rPAI-1. The phenotype of the adhered cells was examined to understand why there was an increase in cell adhesion to VN and FN by MDA-MB-435 cells expressing wild-type PAI-1 and PAI-3. Cells were adhered to either VN- or FN-coated glass coverslips and stained with FITC-labeled phalloidin, which binds specifically to the cytoskeletal protein F-actin (Fig. 5, figure shows representative fields). There were striking differences in the phenotype of the wt-PAI-1- and wt-PAI-3-expressing cells when adhered to VN and FN. Within 1 h of adhesion to VN and FN, there was an increase in the number of wt-PAI-1-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells adhered compared with the P14-PAI-1-expressing and MDA-MB-435 cell controls. Moreover, these cells flattened and formed focal contacts when adhered to VN and FN (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). Although comparable numbers of wt-PAI-3- and wt-PAI-1-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells adhered to VN, the wt-PAI-3-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells did not flatten or form focal contacts on VN in 1 h (Fig.5 G). However, wt-PAI-3 cells did flatten and form focal contacts when adhered to FN (Fig. 5 H), resembling the wt-PAI-1-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 5, compare B andH). There was no apparent difference in the numbers or the phenotype of adhered cells between the control MDA-MB-435 cells and the P14-PAI-1 and P14-PAI-3-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells on either VN or FN.Panels C, F, I, L, andO of Fig. 5 show actin staining of the control, wt-, and P14-PAI-1-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells, and wt- and P14-PAI-3-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells, respectively, adhered to uncoated, native glass coverslips. The phenotype of all cells appears similar with approximately the same number of cells adhering per condition. The expression profiles of various integrin subunits on the surface of the wt-PAI-1- and wt-PAI-3-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells were determined to begin to investigate a mechanism for the increased cell adhesion observed. The levels of α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, α6, αv, β1, β3, and β4 integrins were assessed by flow cytometry. Theleft side of Fig. 6 shows the integrin profiles for α2, α3, α4, α5, and β1 in the control, wt-PAI-1- and P14-PAI-1-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells, respectively. The levels of these integrin subunits were increased on the surface of wt-PAI-1-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells compared with the P14-PAI-1-expressing cells and the control MDA-MB-435 cells. Similar results were observed for wt-PAI-3 compared with P14-PAI-3-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 6, right side). There were also increased levels of the α1 and αv integrin subunits detected on the wt-PAI-3-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells (data not shown). We detected no change in the integrin profiles for α1, α 6, αv, β3, or β4 subunits on wt-PAI-1-, P14-PAI-1-, or P14-PAI-3-expressing MDA-MB-435 cells compared with control MDA-MB-435 cells. Because the prototypic VN receptor is αvβ3, we were surprised that we did not detect increased levels of these integrin subunits on the surface of the wt-PAI-1- and wt-PAI-3-expressing cells. Further flow cytometry analysis with an antibody that detected the αvβ5 heterodimer was performed. There was no detectable difference in the expression of αv, β3, or αvβ5subunits on the surface of the wt-PAI-1-expressing cells, or on the P14-PAI-1-expressing and control populations. To investigate whether the increased expression of the β1integrin subunit was at least partially responsible for the increased adhesion of the wild-type-expressing cells, we conducted a series of adhesion experiments with a β1-blocking antibody to substrates that require integrin adhesion through β1subunits, namely FN and LN, but not VN. Addition of an anti-human β1 antibody significantly decreased wt-PAI-1-expressing MBA-MB-435 cell adhesion to both FN and LN, but the antibody had no effect on adhesion to VN (Fig. 7). In control experiments, a nonspecific IgG did not significantly alter wt-PAI-1-expressing MBA-MB-435 cell adhesion to any of the protein substrates (data not shown). Because the phenotype of the MDA-MB-435 cells expressing either w"

An intracellular target of calbindin was discovered using bacteriophage display. Human recombinant calbindin was immobilized on magnetic beads and used in affinity purification of phage-displayed peptides from a random 12-mer peptide library. One sequence, SYSSIAKYPSHS, was strongly selected both in the presence of Mg2+ and in the presence of Ca2+. Homology search against the protein sequence data base identified a closely similar sequence, ISSIKEKYPSHS, at residues 55–66 inmyo-inositol-1(or 4)-monophosphatase (IMPase, EC 3.1.3.25), which constitute a strongly conserved and exposed region in the three-dimensional structure. IMPase is a key enzyme in the regulation of the activity of the phosphatidylinositol-signaling pathway. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of myo-inositol-1(or 4)-monophosphate to form free myo-inositol, maintaining a supply that represents the precursor for inositol phospholipid second messenger signaling systems. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that isolated calbindin and IMPase interact with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, K D, of 0.9 μm. Both apo and Ca2+-bound calbindin was found to activate IMPase up to 250-fold, depending on the pH and substrate concentration. The activation is most pronounced at conditions that otherwise lead to a very low activity of IMPase,i.e. at reduced pH and at low substrate concentration.

It is expressed in many tissues including brain, intestine, kidney, and pancreas. Many reports have focused on the presence of calbindin in specific neuronal cell types in the brain and sensory system (1Mikkonen M. Soininen H. Pitkanen A. J. Comp.

Rev. 1989; 10: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), and in some cells it may be present at intracellular concentrations of up to 2 mm (5Oberholtzer J.C. Buettger C. Summers M.C.

The protein has been demonstrated to protect neurons against excitotoxic cell death (6Mattson M.P. Rychlik B. Chu C. Christakos S. Neuron. 1991; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and spares neurons from apoptotic cell death following ischemic insults or epileptic seizures where damage is believed to occur from Ca2+ overload (7Sloviter R.S.

Neurol. 1989; 280: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Calbindin is of further importance for motor coordination in mice (9Airaksinen M.S. Eilers J. Garaschuk O. Thoenen H. Konnerth A. Meyer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) and has been suggested to restrict evoked Ca2+ signals in nerve synapses and hair cells (10Roberts W.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3246-3262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Chard P.S. Bleakman D. Christakos S. Fullmer C.S. Miller R.J. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1993; 472: 341-357Crossref Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Most of these results have been explained by the proposed function of calbindin as a potent intracellular Ca2+-buffering protein. Whether or not calbindin has additional regulatory functions similar to the prototypical Ca2+ sensor calmodulin is currently under debate. To date, there are only a few reports describing specificin vitro effects of calbindin on enzyme systems (12Morgan D.W. Welton A.F. Heick A.E. Christakos S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Bellido T. Huening M. Raval-Pandya M. Manolagas S.C. Christakos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26328-26332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 14Reisner P.D. Christakos S. Vanaman T.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our earlier work has shown that calbindin has exposed hydrophobic surfaces both in the apo and Ca2+ form (15Berggård T. Silow M. Thulin E. Linse S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6864-6873Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Exposure of hydrophobic surfaces to water is thermodynamically unfavorable, and it is therefore likely that calbindin uses these surfaces to interact with other cellular proteins. In the present work, we have searched for potential targets of calbindin by affinity purification of a phage display library of random 12-mer peptides against immobilized calbindin. One sequence, which was strongly selected in the presence of either Mg2+ or Ca2+, was used in a homology search against the protein sequence data base. A strong match was found with residues 55–66 in myo-inositol-1(or 4)-monophosphatase (IMPase). IMPase catalyzes the dephosphorylation ofmyo-inositol monophosphates (myo-inositol 1-P andmyo-inositol 4-P) to release inositol, which is used to regenerate phosphatidylinositides (PIs), key components in the PI signaling pathway (16Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway produces two important intracellular messengers,myo-inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. IP3 is a water-soluble molecule that diffuses through the cytosol and releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores by binding to IP3-gated Ca2+ release channels. Diacylglycerol remains bound to the plasma membrane and activates protein kinase C, a crucial enzyme that regulates many target proteins through phosphorylation. Although the enzymatic function of IMPase and its structural properties are relatively well characterized, surprisingly little is known about the regulation of the enzyme. Here we show that calbindin and IMPase bind to each other with a K D of ∼1 μm and that calbindin increases the phosphatase activity of IMPase. Human recombinant calbindin was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described (17Thulin E. Linse S. Protein Exprression Purif. 1999; 15: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The apo form of calbindin was prepared using gel filtration of protein/EGTA mixtures (15Berggård T. Silow M. Thulin E. Linse S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6864-6873Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). IMPase was purified from bovine brain using ammonium sulfate precipitation, heat treatment, and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, as described in detail elsewhere. 2E. Thulin and S. Linse, submitted for publication. Rat recombinant calretinin and human recombinant secretagogin were gifts from Patrick Groves and Malgorzata Palczewska (Nencki Institute, Warsaw, Poland). myo-Inositol-1-monophosphate from soybean was purchased from Sigma and Tween 20 from Riedel de Hahn. The Ph.D.-12 Phage Display Peptide Library kit was obtained from New England Biolabs. The kit contains a random peptide 12-mer phage display library, E. coli ER2738 host strain for phage amplification, and a sequencing primer (5′CCCTCATAGTTAGCGTAACG). Additional primer of the same sequence was purchased from DNA Technologies (Aarhus, Denmark). Dynabeads M-280 were from Dynal Biotech (Oslo, Norway). Sulfosuccinimidyl-6-[biotinoamido]hexanoate (NHS-LC-biotin), biotin (immuno pure), bovine serum albumin (immuno pure, fraction V), 2-(4′-hydroxyazobenzene) benzoic acid (HABA), and avidin were from Pierce. All buffers and other chemicals were of analytical grade. Synthetic peptides with acetylated N terminus and amidated C terminus were purchased from Malmö General Hopsital, department of Clinical Chemistry (ISSIKEKYPSHS), and Medprobe (Oslo, Norway) (SYSSIAKYPSHS). Phage display studies were carried out as described in detail in the manual provided with the Ph.D.-12 Phage Display Peptide Library kit. In short, calbindin was conjugated to NHS-LC-biotin and bound to magnetic beads covered with streptavidin (Dynabeads M-280). The beads were then equilibrated with the phage display library for 60 min. Parallel experiments were carried out in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20 with either 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mmMgCl2 plus 100 μm EGTA. The beads were then washed ten times with the respective buffer to remove weakly bound phages, and the more strongly bound phages were eluted by washing the beads with 0.2 m glycine buffer at pH 2.2 containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The eluates were neutralized by adding 1m Tris/HCl, pH 9.1, and used to infect E. coliER2738 at mid log-phase (OD = 0.5). After 5 h of culturing, phages were purified from the culture supernatant using PEG precipitation. Phage eluate from the third round of affinity purification was used to infect E. coli ER2738 and spread on LB plates with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside to obtain plaques deriving from single phages. Sequencing templates were prepared from individual plaques as described in the manual for the Ph.D.-12 Phage Display Peptide Library kit. DNA sequencing reactions were performed in an Eppendorff Gradient Mastercycler using Big Dyes Cycle Sequencing kit from Applied Biosystems and the sequencing primer. The reaction products were separated on an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer from Applied Biosystems. The interaction between calbindin and IMPase was studied in a quartz cuvette with 3 mm path length using fluorescence spectroscopy. Excitation spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS50B fluorescence spectrometer between 200 and 300 nm (bandwidth 2.5 nm) with emission at 331 nm (bandwidth 3 nm), thus monitoring mainly tryptophan fluorescence. Two samples, one with 10 μm IMPase and one with 10 μm IMPase plus 20 μm calbindin, were mixed in different proportions to obtain calbindin concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 μm. A second series of samples contained calbindin at the same concentrations, ranging from 0 to 20 μm, but no IMPase. Fluorescence excitation spectra were recorded for each sample, and the spectrum of each IMPase calbindin mixture was subtracted from the sum of spectra recorded separately for IMPase and calbindin at the same concentration. The resulting fluorescence difference, ΔF, was plotted as a function of total calbindin exemplified in Fig. 1 for excitation at 236 nm, and the data was fitted using the following equation. ΔF=ΔF0+ΔFmax[CB]/([CB]+KD)Equation 1 with the free calbindin concentration, [CB], calculated as follows. [CB]=−0.5(CIMPase+KD−CCB)+{0.25(CIMpase+KD−CCB)2+CCBKD}0.5Equation 2 CIMPase is the total IMPase concentration and CCB the total calbindin concentration. The interaction between calbindin and synthetic peptides with the sequence SYSSIAKYPSHS or ISSIKEKYPSHS was studied using fluorescence spectroscopy in a similar procedure as described above but keeping the calbindin concentration constant (10 μm) and varying the peptide concentration (0–500 μm). The reaction buffer (50 mmHepes/KOH, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.1) was rocked for 1 week in a plastic container with Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) in a dialysis bag to reduce the Ca2+ concentration followed by the removal of the Chelex bag and addition of 2 mm MgCl2 or 100 μm EGTA and 2 mm MgCl2. A number of stock solutions with different concentrations of IMP and calbindin were prepared in the reaction buffer. IMP stock (50 μl) was mixed with calbindin or a buffer blank (50 μl), and the reaction was started by adding IMPase stock (100 μl) to yield a final concentration of 0.02 μm IMPase, as estimated by acid hydrolysis. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C between 20 and 240 min, depending on the substrate concentration and pH (see below). The reaction was quenched by adding 20 μl of 12 m HCl followed by a quick centrifugation step to pellet precipitated protein. The supernatant (200 μl) was mixed with a chromophoric reagent (800 μl) and equilibrated for 30 min before 40 μl of 1.5% Tween 20 was added and the absorbance at 660 nm recorded. The chromophoric reagent was prepared by mixing 50 ml of 4.2% (NH4)6MoO24·4H2O in 5m HCl with 150 ml of 0.2% Malachite Green in H2O. The solution was incubated for 30 minutes and then filtered. The assay was standardized using potassium phosphate (0.05–10 μm). The first set of enzymatic assays were performed in the presence of 100 μm EGTA, and the concentration of Ca2+-free calbindin was varied between 0.01 and 600 μm and the substrate concentration between 2.5 and 320 μm. The second set of experiments contained 100 μm EGTA, 40 μm IMP, and 0 or 10 μm calbindin. In these experiments the pH of each stock solution was adjusted prior to mixing to a defined value between 6 and 8, and the solution was kept on a pH electrode during mixing to ensure that the pH did not drift. The third set of enzymatic assays was performed with 40 μm IMP, 0 or 10 μm calbindin, and no EGTA. The total Ca2+ concentration was varied between 0.5 μm and 1 mm. The free Ca2+concentration in the samples with calbindin was calculated using its four macroscopic Ca2+-binding constants (15Berggård T. Silow M. Thulin E. Linse S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6864-6873Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In a fourth set of experiments, the IMPase activity was compared for reaction mixtures containing 0 or 100 μm EGTA. In a fifth set of experiments, in 100 μm EGTA, the specificity of the activation of IMPase by calbindin was examined by measuring the activity of IMPase in the presence of various substances, peptides, or proteins at different concentrations. A random 12-mer peptide library displayed on bacteriophage surface was used to search for sequences with high affinity for calbindin. Peptides binding to human recombinant calbindin were enriched in three rounds of affinity purification, with intervening amplification of high affinity binding phages in E. coli. Parallel experiments were carried out in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ or 1 mm Mg2+.E. coli infected with the eluate from the third round were spread on plates to obtain individual clones for DNA sequencing. In the presence of Ca2+, the sequence SYSSIAKYPSHS was strongly enriched and found in 29 of 30 sequenced clones. In the presence of Mg2+, the same sequence was dominating and found in 11 of 12 sequenced clones. The sequence SYSSIAKYPSHS was used in homology search against the protein sequence data base using the Scanps algorithm (www2.esi.ac.uk/scanps), revealing a strong match with residues 55–66 in the 277-residue enzyme IMPase, ISSIKEKYPSHS. The interaction between calbindin and IMPase was studied using fluorescence spectroscopy as described in under “Experimental Procedures.” The IMPase concentration was kept constant at 10 μm, whereas the calbindin concentration was varied between 0 and 20 μm, and a parallel series of samples contained 0–20 μm calbindin but no IMPase. Significant differences in tryptophan excitation fluorescence spectrum were obtained when comparing calbindin-IMPase mixtures to the sum of spectra recorded individually for the two proteins. The data at one wavelength and computer fit is shown in Fig. 1. The fluorescence difference reaches a maximum at close to 10 μm calbindin, indicating a 1:1 (or 2:2) stoichiometry. The best fit was obtained using K D = 0.9 μm. The interaction between calbindin and synthetic peptides with the sequence SYSSIAKYPSHS or ISSIKEKYPSHS was studied using tryptophan fluorescence excitation spectroscopy. Similar spectral changes (sumversus mix) were obtained as with intact IMPase but requiring larger peptide concentrations, indicating that the binding was weaker (data not shown). Optimal fits to the data were obtained with K D = 160 μm for the SYSSIAKYPSHS peptide and K D = 330 μmfor the ISSIKEKYPSHS peptide. It may seem surprising to have purified a peptide with such a low affinity for calbindin D28k. However, each phage particle displays five identical copies of the peptide. This allows the phage to interact with more than one immobilized calbindin molecule to yield an apparent high affinity (avidity). The dephosphorylation of IMP to produce inositol and phosphate was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy. 1H NMR spectra were acquired for 2 mm IMP at different time points after adding catalytic amounts of IMPase in the absence and presence of 50 μm calbindin. The dephosphorylation of IMP into inositol was 4-fold faster in the presence of calbindin than in its absence (data not shown). This indicates that the phosphatase activity of IMPase is enhanced by calbindin. The cellular concentration of IMP is, however, around 20 μm, which yields poor NMR signals. Further activity measurements were therefore performed using a chromophoric method to quantitate released phosphate (18Itaya K. Ui M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1966; 14: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Using the chromophoric assay, the IMPase activity was measured in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ and 100 μmEGTA to avoid perturbations from Ca2+ ions. Assays were performed in the absence and presence of calbindin (0.01–600 μm) at substrate concentrations ranging between 2.5 and 300 μm (Fig.2). These data show that the activity of IMPase is enhanced by the presence of calbindin. Half-maximal activation is reached at calbindin concentrations of 1–10 μm. It also appears that the less substrate used the larger the effect of calbindin (Fig. 2 B). No hydrolysis of IMP was observed in control experiments with 100 μm calbindin but no IMPase. No free phosphate was detected in reaction mixtures with 100 μm calbindin and 0.04 μm IMPase but no IMP. The activity of IMPase was not enhanced in the presence of calbindin digested with trypsin or pepsin (not shown). Calbindin digested with trypsin or pepsin did not bind to IMPase (not shown). The activating effect of calbindin on IMPase activity could be displaced by the ISSIKEKYPSHS peptide (not shown), whereas the unrelated peptide SGIAQFHIDYNNVS 3HIDYNNVS and SGIAQFHIDYNNVS are the sequences of two synthetic peptides derived from human vitamin K-dependent protein S (30Giri T.K. Linse S. Garcia de Frutos P. Yamazaki T. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15099-15106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a plasma protein completely unrelated to calbindin. had no effect. The activity of IMPase was also measured in the presence of the proteins calretinin and secretagogin (19Gartner W. Lang W. Leutmetzer F. Domanovits H. Waldhausl W. Wagner L. Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 1161-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Wagner L. Oliyarnyk O. Gartner W. Nowotny P. Groeger M. Kaserer K. Waldhausl W. Pasternack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24740-24751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), both of which contain six-EF-hands and are homologous of calbindin, and in the presence of a few other macromolecules (HIDYNNVS, SGIAQFHIDYNNVS, poly-d-glutamic acid, poly-l-lysine, PEG 4000, PEG 8000, cytochrome c, and calmodulin). At comparable conditions, the IMPase activity in the presence of 25 μmmacromolecule divided by the activity of IMPase alone (the relative activity) was 1.01 for calretinin, 0.99 for secretagogin, 1.06 for HIDYNNVS, 0.99 for SGIAQFHIDYNNVS, 1.13 for poly-d-Glu, 0.94 for ploy-l-Lys, 1.00 for PEG 4000, 0.99 for PEG 8000, 1.20 for cytochrome c, 1.41 for calmodulin, and 3.22 for calbindin. Small stimulatory effects on IMPase activity are hence observed in the presence of calmodulin, cytochromec, and poly-glutamic acid. All the other proteins and substances, including calretinin and secretagogin, show no or negligible activation of IMPase. The experiments were performed three times using double samples, and the deviations were less than 5%. Using the chromophoric assay, the IMPase activity was measured in the presence of 2 mmMg2+ and 100 μm EGTA at pH values ranging from 6.0 to 8.0 (Fig. 3). The activity of IMPase is steeply pH-dependent between pH 7 and 6, and the activity is practically lost at pH 6 (Fig. 3 A). No released phosphate could be detected at pH 6 even after a 4-h reaction time. In the presence of calbindin, the IMPase activity is only slightly reduced below pH 7, and a significant level of activity remains at pH 6. Therefore, the relative activation by calbindin is larger the lower the pH (Fig. 3 B). At pH 6 the relative activation cannot be calculated because no activity is observed in the absence of calbindin. Using the chromophoric assay, the IMPase activity was measured in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ and variable Ca2+concentrations (Fig. 4). The activity of IMPase is reduced at Ca2+ concentrations above ∼10 μm, and at 1 mm Ca2+ the activity is lost. However, calbindin activates the enzyme significantly also in the presence of Ca2+. The IMPase activity observed at 400 μm Ca2+ and 10 μmcalbindin is comparable with that observed in the absence of both Ca2+ and calbindin. In this report we show that calbindin D28k interacts with (Fig. 1) and activates IMPase (Fig. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). The activation is highly specific because calretinin and secretagogin, two hexa EF-hand proteins that are homologous to calbindin D28k (58 and 37% sequence identity, respectively), do not have any observable effect on the activity of the enzyme. The calbindin-binding peptide enriched from the phage display library (SYSSIAKYPSHS) displays 75% identity with residues 55–66 in IMPase (ISSIKEKYPSHS). Sequence identity is obtained for residues 56–58 (SSI) and 61–66 (KYPSHS). The three-dimensional structure of IMPase (21Bone R. Springer J.P. Atack J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10031-10035Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) is a symmetric homodimer in which the side chains of residues 61–66 are surface-exposed in an extended loop (Fig.5). Residues 55–61 are at the end of an α-helix that may function to stabilize the loop. The two identical 55–66 sites are maximally separated in the structure such that the homodimer may bind two calbindin molecules without steric hindrance (calbindin, 30 kDa, is slightly smaller than the IMPase monomer, 32 kDa). These structural features make residues 55–66 an ideal site for protein-protein interaction. The 12-residue segment is strongly conserved. It is identical in IMPase of human, porcine, rat, and african clawed frog origin, whereas the bovine sequence has a Thr in stead of Ser at position 57. IMPase is a key enzyme in the regulation of the activity of the PI signaling pathway (Fig. 6), which is of major importance in all eukaryotes. IMPase hydrolyzes IMP to produce phosphate and myo-inositol, the starting material for synthesis of PI, as well as phosphatidylinositol mono- and di-phophates (PIP and PIP2), and subsequently IP3. IMPase hence acts in the biosynthetic pathway leading from IMP to IP3. IP3 is an agonist of the IP3receptor, which is a Ca2+ channel in the endoplasmatic reticulum. IP3 may stimulate the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmatic reticulum store to increase the cytosolic Ca2+ levels, although the action of both IP3 and Ca2+ on the IP3 receptor is intricately coupled (22Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3313) Google Scholar). The released Ca2+ ions bind to a number of Ca2+ sensor proteins, e.g. calmodulin, leading to the activation of a vast number of enzymes and cellular events. IP3 is short-lived and rapidly depleted if not newly synthesized; its half-life in neuronal cells may be as short as 100 ms (23Boekhoff I. Tareilus E. Strotmann J. Breer H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2453-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of IMPase is therefore required to sustain the PI signaling pathway. The stimulatory effect of calbindin on IMPase activity is apparently not regulated directly by Ca2+ because IMPase is activated by calbindin both in the absence and presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4). This is in striking contrast to the calmodulin system where target enzyme regulation is Ca2+-dependent. The calbindin gene expression is known to be up-regulated during cell stress (24Lowenstein D.H. Gwinn R.P. Seren M.S. Simon R.P. McIntosh T.K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 22: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Lowenstein D.H. Miles M.F. Hatam F. McCabe T. Neuron. 1991; 6: 627-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Lee S. Williamson J. Lothman E.W. Szele F.G. Chesselet M.F. von Hagen S. Sapolsky R.M. Mattson M.P. Christakos S. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 47: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is striking that the relative activation of IMPase by calbindin is largest during stress conditions such as low substrate concentration (Fig. 2) and during acidosis (Fig. 4). The latter condition often occurs as a side effect of Ca2+ entry. During cell stress conditions, calbindin may act as a survival molecule, which ensures the activity of IMPase under conditions at which the activity would otherwise be lost. Lithium, carbamazepine, and valproic acid are effective mood-stabilizing treatments for bipolar affective disorder. Recently, it has been shown that all these drugs act by causing cellular inositol depletion (27Williams R.S. Cheng L. Mudge A.W. Harwood A.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Based on these findings it was suggested that the development of new therapies for bipolar disorder should focus on inositol phosphate metabolism (27Williams R.S. Cheng L. Mudge A.W. Harwood A.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Both IMPase and the IP3receptor are considered attractive therapeutic targets for conditions in which the amount of Ca2+/inositol signaling needs to be controlled. It has been proposed that lithium inhibits IMPase, thereby causing a depletion of inositol, reduced synthesis of PIs, and attenuated PI-linked signal transduction (28Atack J.R. Broughton H.B. Pollack S.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 343-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A serious drawback with Li+ therapy is the narrow margin between the therapeutic (0.5–1 mm) and toxic (> 2 mm) doses (28Atack J.R. Broughton H.B. Pollack S.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 343-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Li+ may interfere with the homeostasis of different electrolytes and essential ions as well as ion transport. There is considerable interest in finding novel regulators of IMPase with a larger therapeutic concentration window and fewer side effects. The discovery of calbindin as a potential cellular activator of IMPase could be of interest in the development of novel pharmacological treatments for conditions due to an imbalance of the Ca2+/IP3 pathways. Substances may be constructed that enhance or attenuate the activity of IMPase based on its interaction with calbindin, for example by competing with either protein for binding to the other one, by altering the affinity of calbindin for IMPase, by altering rates of association and dissociation of the two proteins, by altering the Ca2+-binding properties of calbindin, by affecting the expression levels of calbindin, or by otherwise affecting its ability to regulate IMPase. The generous gift of secretagogin and calretinin by Patrick Groves and Malgorzata Palczewska, Nencki Insitute, Warsaw is gratefully acknowledged."

The disease is characterized by a broad phenotypic spectrum that includes seizures, mental retardation, renal dysfunction, and dermatological abnormalities. TSC1 encodes a 130-kDa protein called hamartin, and TSC2 encodes a 200-kDa protein called tuberin. Although it has been shown that hamartin and tuberin form a complex and mediate phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt-dependent phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6, it is not yet clear how inactivation of either protein leads to tuberous sclerosis.

Finally, it was shown that the tuberin/14-3-3ζ interaction is regulated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of tuberin, providing insight into how tuberin may regulate phosphorylation of S6. tuberous sclerosis glutathione S-transferase fragile X mental retardation protein In humans, germ-line mutations to the TSC1 andTSC2 tumor suppressor genes cause the autosomal dominant disease tuberous sclerosis (TSC)1 (1The European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium Cell. 1993; 75: 1305-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar, 2van Slegtenhorst M. de Hoogt R.

TheTSC1 gene encodes hamartin, a novel 130-kDa protein, whereasTSC2 encodes a 200-kDa protein called tuberin. Tuberin and hamartin interact to form a protein complex, and it has been suggested that inactivation of this complex leads to TSC (3van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J.

The defects in cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation that these lesions display indicate that theTSC1 and TSC2 gene products participate in the control of cell growth and division (6). Overexpression of either tuberin or hamartin lengthens G1 and inhibits cell proliferation, whereas G1 is shortened and tissues become hypertrophic when either gene is inactivated (7Jin F. Wienecke R.

Genetic studies in Drosophila provided the first evidence that tuberin and hamartin are involved in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) signal transduction pathway (11Tapon N. Ito N.

More recently, it was shown that Akt interacts with and phosphorylates tuberin (14Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol.

However, despite these exciting findings, it is not yet clear exactly how phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling defects lead to the wide variety of lesions associated with TSC. Previous work indicated that tuberin and hamartin interact within a large cytoplasmic complex, possibly containing other protein components (18Nellist M. van Slegtenhorst M.A. Goedbloed M. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Halley D.J.J. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35647-35652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To identify the components of this complex and thereby obtain new clues toward the functions of tuberin and hamartin, yeast two-hybrid screening experiments were performed. An interaction between tuberin and 14-3-3ζ was identified. 14-3-3ζ belongs to a family of abundant 28–33-kDa acidic polypeptides (19Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3061-3064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins are broadly expressed and conserved in a wide range of eukaryotes. At least seven different isoforms have been identified in mammalian cells, and 14-3-3 proteins have also been shown to be essential for both budding and fission yeast viability (20Gelperin D. Weigle J. Nelson K. Roseboom P. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Lemmon S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11539-11543Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins have been implicated in cell cycle control (21Ford J.C. al Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Carr A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and shown to interact with a wide range of signaling proteins (22Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Many of these interactions are mediated through the binding of the 14-3-3 protein to two specific phosphoserine-containing sequences, RSXpSXP and RXXXpSXP, in the target protein (23Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). The involvement of 14-3-3ζ in phosphorylation-dependent regulation of signal transduction pathways made it an interesting candidate for a tuberin binding partner, and the interaction between tuberin and 14-3-3ζ was investigated in more detail. The interaction between tuberin and 14-3-3ζ conformed to the pattern of binding of 14-3-3ζ to many other target proteins, and the interaction was shown to be representative of the binding between tuberin and the 14-3-3 protein family in general. The tuberin/14-3-3ζ interaction was shown to be dependent on Akt-mediated phosphorylation of tuberin, and evidence for multiple putative 14-3-3ζ-binding sites in tuberin was obtained. The full-length TSC1 andTSC2 expression constructs have been described previously (3van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Truncated TSC2 expression constructs encoding tuberin amino acids 1–607 (NruI truncation), 1–1099 (XmaI truncation), 1–252 plus 1536–1784 (SacI internal deletion), 607–1099 (NruI-XmaI fragment), and 1125–1784 (NruI-XmaI fragment) and the TSC2 R611Q and R905Q variant expression constructs have also been described elsewhere (5Nellist M. Verhaaf B. Goedbloed M.A. Reuser A.J.J. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Halley D.J.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2889-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The TSC2 S540A variant expression construct was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the original wild-type TSC2 expression construct using the Stratagene QuikChange kit. For the yeast two-hybrid screening experiments, the full-length TSC2 cDNA was cloned into the BamHI site of the pAS1 vector (Clontech). This construct was called pAS1-TSC2. The two full-length TSC2 variant constructs for the yeast two-hybrid experiments (pAS1-TSC2-R611Q and pAS1-TSC2-R905Q) were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the pAS1-TSC2construct. For the transfection experiments, a full-length 14-3-3ζ cDNA, identified in the yeast two-hybrid screening experiments, was cloned as a BamHI-BglII fragment into the BamHI cloning sites of the pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1/his mammalian expression vectors. For production of a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-14-3-3ζ recombinant fusion protein, the full-length 14-3-3ζ cDNA was cloned as an EcoRI fragment from the pcDNA3.1 expression construct into the pGEX-2T vector. All of the constructs were sequenced completely. Constructs encoding GST fusion proteins of the β, ε, γ, η, and τ isoforms of 14-3-3 were kindly provided by Dr. J. Zhai (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), and the GST-Ral binding domain construct was provided by Dr. M. van Triest and Professor J. L. Bos (University of Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands). Mammalian expression constructs encoding activated, wild-type, and dominant-negative Akt isoforms were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. A yeast two-hybrid screen using a Gal4-full-length tuberin fusion protein as bait (pAS1-TSC2) was performed on a human adult brain library cloned into the pACT2 vector following the recommendations of the supplier (Clontech). Colonies that grew on selective medium (Leu−/His−/Trp−) were screened by a β-galactosidase colony lift assay. The cDNA inserts of the positive colonies were amplified by PCR using primers complementary to the pACT2 vector (5′-taccactacaatggatgatg-3′ and 5′-gttgaagtgaacttgcgggg-3′) and sequenced. Subsequently, the pACT2-cDNA constructs were isolated from the positive yeast clones as recommended by the supplier, transformed into super-competentEscherichia coli by electroporation, grown under selection, and re-isolated. The purified constructs were then retested against the original pAS1-TSC2 bait construct. To ensure that the interactions were specific, the positive clones were also tested against a Gal4-hamartin bait construct (pGBT-EE1b) (3van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), a Gal4 bait construct lacking a cDNA insert (pAS1), and two tuberin variant constructs (pAS1-TSC2-R611Q and pAS1-TSC2-R905Q). These experiments were performed as described previously (3van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 18Nellist M. van Slegtenhorst M.A. Goedbloed M. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Halley D.J.J. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol.

All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. For transfection experiments, COS-1 cells were seeded into 30-cm2 culture dishes and grown overnight to a confluency of 50–70%. Expression constructs were transfected into the cells using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Forty-two hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 (buffer A) as described previously (18Nellist M. van Slegtenhorst M.A. Goedbloed M. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Halley D.J.J. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35647-35652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (80-cm2 culture dishes) were lysed in protein phosphatase-1 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 mmEDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 10 min on ice, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein phosphatase-1 (10 units; New England Biolabs Inc.) and MnCl2 (1 mm final concentration) were added to the lysate, which was subsequently incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. As a control, the lysate was incubated for 60 min at 30 °C without protein phosphatase-1 and in the presence of different phosphatase inhibitors (50 mmNaF, 10 mm Na3VO4, and 50 mm EDTA). For the GST-14-3-3 binding experiments, GST fusion protein expression was induced for 3 h in a 500-ml culture of E. coli BL21 by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and sonicated thoroughly (10 × 30 s), and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. After gentle mixing for 30 min at 4 °C, the lysate was spun at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The induced GST fusion protein in the supernatant fraction was bound to 250 μl of prewashed glutathione-Sepharose beads for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline to remove nonspecifically bound bacterial proteins, and the quantity and purity of the GST fusion protein bound to the glutathione-Sepharose beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cleared HeLa or transfected COS-1 cell lysates (300–500 μl) were added to 20 μl of the washed GST-14-3-3 beads and mixed by gentle rotation for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The beads were recovered by centrifugation (2500 × g, 15 s, 4 °C), washed three times with lysis buffer, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer prior to immunoblot analysis. Human brain cortex (∼50 mg) was suspended in 1 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm NaF and sonicated twice for 10 s. After centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was recovered and incubated with antibodies specific for 14-3-3ζ on ice for 60 min before the addition of 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose suspension. After gentle rotation for 90 min at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 700 μl of lysis buffer before being analyzed by immunoblotting. The tuberin- and hamartin-specific antibodies used in this study have been described previously (3van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The FMRP-specific antibody was provided by Dr. F. Tamanini (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands), and the tau-specific antibody was provided by Dr. E. van Herpen (Erasmus University). 14-3-3ζ-specific monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-629 and sc-1019) and used at the manufacturer's recommended dilutions. Yeast two-hybrid screening experiments were performed on ∼5 × 105 clones from the human adult brain cDNA library using a bait construct encoding full-length tuberin. From the 160 colonies that grew on selective medium, 115 were positive in a β-galactosidase selection assay, and 54 clones were isolated and sequenced. Of these, five independent clones encoded full-length 14-3-3ζ. The interactions between the full-length 14-3-3ζ clones and the tuberin bait construct were retested in the yeast two-hybrid assay. As shown in Table I, the interaction between 14-3-3ζ and tuberin was confirmed, and no interaction between 14-3-3ζ and either a bait construct encoding the Gal4 binding domain only or a bait construct encoding a fusion of the Gal4 binding domain with the hamartin coiled coil domain (pGBT-EE1b) (3van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) was detected. Next, the interaction between 14-3-3ζ and two different tuberin variants (R611Q and R905Q) was investigated. Both the R611Q and R905Q amino acid substitutions resulted from pathogenicTSC2 mutations. Previous work has demonstrated that the R611Q substitution inhibits tuberin phosphorylation and disrupts the interaction between tuberin and hamartin, whereas the R905Q substitution does not (5Nellist M. Verhaaf B. Goedbloed M.A. Reuser A.J.J. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Halley D.J.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2889-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, β-galactosidase activity was stimulated when the bait constructs pAS1-TSC2and pAS1-TSC2-R905Q (encoding wild-type tuberin and the tuberin R905Q variant) were cotransformed with either pACT2–14-3-3ζ (encoding 14-3-3ζ) or pGAD-EE1a (encoding hamartin amino acids 334–1153). In contrast, β-galactosidase activity was not stimulated when the R611Q variant was tested. The results from the yeast two-hybrid experiments were therefore consistent with the published data on the interaction between hamartin and different tuberin variants (5Nellist M. Verhaaf B. Goedbloed M.A. Reuser A.J.J. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Halley D.J.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2889-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and indicated that the tuberin/14-3-3ζ interaction was sensitive to pathogenic tuberin amino acid substitutions.Table IInteraction between tuberin and 14–3-3ζ in the yeast two-hybrid systemGBDaGBD, Gal4 binding domain; GAD, Gal4 activating domain. baitGAD preyInteraction (β-galactosidase filter lift assay)ConstructFusion proteinConstructFusion proteinpAS1-TSC2GBD-tuberinpACT2-14-3-3ζGAD-14-3-3ζ+++pAS1-TSC2GBD-tuberinpGAD-EE1aGAD-hamartin-(334-1153)+++pAS1-TSC2GBD-tuberinpACT2GAD−pAS1-TSC2-R611QGBD-tuberin R611QpACT2-14-3-3ζGAD-14-3-3ζ−pAS1-TSC2-R611QGBD-tuberin R611QpGAD-EE1aGAD-hamartin-(334-1153)−pAS1-TSC2-R611QGBD-tuberin R611QpACT2GAD−pAS1-TSC2-R905QGBD-tuberin R905QpACT2-14-3-3ζGAD-14-3-3ζ+++pAS1-TSC2-R905QGBD-tuberin R905QpGAD-EE1aGAD-hamartin-(334-1153)+++pAS1-TSC2-R905QGBD-tuberin R905QpACT2GAD−pGBT-EE1bGBD-hamartin-(334-1153)pACT2-14-3-3ζGAD-14-3-3ζ−pASGBDpACT2-14-3-3ζGAD-14-3-3ζ−a GBD, Gal4 binding domain; GAD, Gal4 activating domain. Open table in a new tab To verify that the interaction between tuberin and 14-3-3ζ was specific, COS-1 cells were transfected with a TSC2 expression construct. After 48 h, the cells were lysed, and the cleared lysate was incubated with a bacterially expressed GST-14-3-3ζ fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Tuberin retained by the GST-14-3-3ζ beads was detected by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.1 A, tuberin bound to the GST-14-3-3ζ beads, but not to glutathione-Sepharose beads alone, glutathione-Sepharose beads containing GST, or glutathione-Sepharose beads containing another GST fusion protein (GST-Ral binding domain) (24Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The binding between wild-type tuberin and the GST-14-3-3ζ beads was compared with the binding of the tuberin R611Q and R905Q variants. COS-1 cells were transfected with expression constructs encoding the different tuberin variants, and the lysates were incubated with the GST-14-3-3ζ beads as described above. A third tuberin variant (S540A) was also tested (discussed below). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the R611Q variant was retained by the GST-14-3-3ζ beads less efficiently than wild-type tuberin and the R905Q and S540A variants, consistent with the results from the yeast two-hybrid experiments. To investigate whether the tuberin/14-3-3ζ interaction affects the interaction between tuberin and hamartin, cleared lysates from COS-1 cells overexpressing tuberin, hamartin, or both proteins were incubated with the GST-14-3-3ζ beads. As shown in Fig.2 A, hamartin was retained by the GST-14-3-3ζ beads when tuberin was coexpressed, indicating either that the tuberin-hamartin complex was able to interact with the GST-14-3-3ζ beads or that hamartin could interact directly with 14-3-3ζ. In overexpressing cells, tuberin maintains hamartin in the soluble cytosolic fraction (18Nellist M. van Slegtenhorst M.A. Goedbloed M. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Halley D.J.J. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35647-35652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, when a COS-1 cell lysate overexpressing only hamartin was tested in the binding assay, the assay was uninformative. Hamartin was not retained by the GST-14-3-3ζ beads because it was not present in the cleared cell lysate (Fig.2 A). Retention of hamartin by the GST-14-3-3ζ beads in the presence of tuberin indicated that the interaction between tuberin and 14-3-3ζ was compatible with the interaction between tuberin and hamartin. A cleared lysate from HeLa cells expressing endogenous levels of tuberin and hamartin was tested in a GST-14-3-3ζ binding assay. As shown in Fig. 2 B, both tuberin and hamartin were retained by the beads, whereas a control protein (FMRP) was not. The presence of the tuberin-hamartin complex in the HeLa lysate was demonstrated by the presence of tuberin in the hamartin immunoprecipitate. In Fig.2 B, the intensities of the signals for tuberin and hamartin were approximately equal in the immunoprecipitate fraction. In contrast, the tuberin signal in the lysate was more intense than the hamartin signal, indicating that only a proportion of the total tuberin in the cell was associated with hamartin. The weak hamartin signal in the GST-14-3-3ζ-bound fraction is consistent with the GST-14-3-3ζ beads binding both free tuberin and the tuberin-hamartin complex. To investigate whether the interaction between tuberin and 14-3-3ζ occurs in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on lysates of HeLa cells as well as human brain cortex. Attempts to co-immunoprecipitate tuberin and 14-3-3ζ from HeLa cells were unsuccessful. However, as shown in Fig.3, tuberin was co-immunoprecipitated from brain cortex by antibodies specific for 14-3-3ζ, indicating that tuberin and 14-3-3ζ associate in vivo. Consistent with the results of the GST-14-3-3ζ binding assay, hamartin was also detectable in the immunoprecipitate, whereas FMRP was not co-immunoprecipitated by the 14-3-3ζ-specific antibodies. Tau, another protein that is known to interact with 14-3-3ζ (25Hashiguchi M. Sobue K. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25247-25254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), was also detected in the immunoprecipitate. To investigate whether tuberin interacts only with 14-3-3ζ or also with additional members of the 14-3-3 protein family, a cleared HeLa cell lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing GST fusion proteins of the β, ε, γ, η, and τ isoforms of 14-3-3 (26Zhai J. Lin H. Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. Canete-Soler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41318-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, both tuberin and hamartin were retained by all of the 14-3-3 isoforms tested, indicating that tuberin interacts with a domain common to the 14-3-3 protein family. Interaction between tuberin and the different 14-3-3 isoforms suggested that tuberin may contain a common binding motif recognized by all 14-3-3 proteins. Indeed, the 14-3-3 protein family binds many target proteins through two specific phosphoserine-containing motifs, RSXpSXP and RXXXpSXP, where pS represents phosphoserine andX is any amino acid (23Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.5 A, Scansite analysis of the amino acid sequence of tuberin identified eight potential 14-3-3-binding motifs (27Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) 2Available at Scansite.mit.edu. : RSLSPP (amino acids 537–542), KHSYTLP (amino acids 599–605), RSTSLN (amino acids 936–941), RSISVS (amino acids 978–983), KSLSVP (amino acids 1251–1256), RSSSVS (amino acids 1335–1340), KSSSSP (amino acids 1384–1389), and HSRSNP (amino acids 1727–1732). Substitution of a single putative phosphorylated serine residue (Ser540) with alanine (RSLSPP to RSLAPP) did not prevent tuberin from binding to the GST-14-3-3ζ beads (Fig. 1 B), consistent with the Scansite prediction that tuberin contains multiple 14-3-3-binding sites. The GST-14-3-3ζ binding assay was repeated using lysates from COS-1 cells transfected with expression constructs encoding different domains of tuberin. As shown in Fig. 5, all of the truncated tuberin proteins containing a putative 14-3-3-binding motif were retained by the GST-14-3-3ζ beads. To determine whether phosphorylation of tuberin at the predicted 14-3-3-binding motifs is necessary for the tuberin/14-3-3ζ interaction, the effect of phosphatase activity on the GST-14-3-3ζ binding assay was investigated. HeLa cell lysates were treated with protein phosphatase-1 before incubation with the GST-14-3-3ζ beads. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 6. After incubation for 1 h at 30 °C either with or without the addition of exogenous protein phosphatase-1, tuberin was no longer retained by the GST-14-3-3ζ beads. Proteolytic degradation of tuberin could be excluded because there was no reduction in the amount of tuberin in the lysate after incubation at 30 °C, and, as shown in Fig. 6 B, the tuberin-hamartin complex was not disrupted by the 30 °C incubation. The lack of tuberin/14-3-3ζ binding was therefore consistent with dephosphorylation of tuberin by protein phosphatase-1, or another endogenous phosphatase, preventing binding to the GST-14-3-3ζ beads. Similar results were obtained with lysates of fibroblasts and transfected COS-1 cells (data not shown). The binding assay was repeated in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitors Na3VO4, NaF, and EDTA (28Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 C, retention of tuberin and hamartin by the GST-14-3-3ζ beads was improved by the addition of either 50 mm NaF or 50 mm EDTA to the cleared cell lysate, consistent with tuberin/14-3-3ζ binding being dependent on tuberin phosphorylation. For comparison, the effects of the phosphatase inhibitors on tuberin/hamartin binding were also investigated. As shown in Fig.6 D, co-immunoprecipitation of the tuberin-hamartin complex was not affected by the addition of either 50 mm NaF or 50 mm EDTA, indicating that the tuberin/14-3-3ζ interaction is more sensitive to tuberin serine dephosphorylation compared with the tuberin/hamartin interaction. The addition of 10 mm Na3VO4completely inhibited tuberin binding to the GST-14-3-3ζ beads. However, analysis of the GST-14-3-3ζ beads after the 10 mm Na3VO4 treatment indicated that Na3VO4 disrupted glutathione-Sepharose/GST binding, possibly due to glutathione oxidation (data not shown) (28Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The tuberin-hamartin complex was also completely disrupted by the presence of 10 mm Na3VO4. When 10 mm Na3VO4 was added to the cell lysate, tuberin and hamartin could not be co-immunoprecipitated by antibodies specific for either tuberin or hamartin. However, direct immunoprecipitation of either protein alone was unaffected by the presence of 10 mm Na3VO4. This indicated that 10 mm Na3VO4 had a specific effect on the interaction between tuberin and hamartin, without affecting the interactions between the two proteins and their respective antibodies. Recent studies have identified tuberin as a target of Akt-mediated phosphorylation (14Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 15Potter C.J. Pedraza L.G. Xu T. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the interaction between phosphorylated tuberin and 14-3-3ζ is affected by Akt activity, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with expression constructs encoding three different tuberin variants (wild-type, R611Q, and R905Q) and wild-type Akt, activated Akt, or a dominant-negative Akt variant. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cleared cell lysates were incubated with the GST-14-3-3ζ beads as described above. As shown in Fig. 7, all three tuberin variants were expressed at similar levels; however, coexpression of the dominant-negative Akt isoform increased the mobility of wild-type tuberin and the R905Q variant on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, whereas the mobility of the R611Q variant was unaffected. This is consistent with previous studies suggesting that the tuberin R611Q variant is incorrectly phosphorylated (5Nellist M. Verhaaf B. Goedbloed M.A. Reuser A.J.J. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Halley D.J.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2889-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As expected, the binding of wild-type tuberin and the R905Q variant to the GST-14-3-3ζ beads was more efficient than the binding of the R611Q variant. However, inhibition of Akt activity by expression of the dominant-negative Akt isoform reduced the binding of all three tuberin variants (the R611Q variant in particular) to the GST-14-3-3ζ beads relative to the binding when either wild-type Akt or the constitutively active isoform was expressed. Therefore, Akt activity promoted tuberin/14-3-3ζ binding, indicating that the interaction is dependent upon Akt-mediated phosphorylation of tuberin. TSC is caused by the inactivation of either tuberin or hamartin. Recent research indicates that tuberin and hamartin are involved in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signal transduction pathway (11Tapon N. Ito N. Dickson B.J. Treisman J.E. Hariharan I.K.

Tuberin is phosphorylated by Akt (14Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar); and in cells lacking either tuberin or hamartin, S6, one of the prime targets of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling, is constitutively phosphorylated (16Kwiatkowski D.J. Zhang H. Bandura J.L. Heiberger K.M. Glogauer M. el-Hashemite N. Onda H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 17Goncharova E.A. Goncharov D.A. Eszterhas A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 30958-30967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the tuberin-hamartin complex may integrate different signals controlling p70 S6 kinase activity and therefore provide the missing link between the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signal cascade and regulation of the p70 S6 kinase (14Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how the tuberin-hamartin complex achieves this. One possibility is that phosphorylation relieves tuberin-mediated inhibition of p70 S6 kinase (14Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). To obtain additional insight into tuberin and hamartin function, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify proteins that interact with tuberin and thereby regulate the functions of tuberin, hamartin, and the tuberin-hamartin complex. One of the proteins identified was 14-3-3ζ, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family. 14-3-3 proteins influence the functions of many different proteins and play an important role in multiple cell pathways, notably those involved in signal transduction. 14-3-3 proteins regulate protein activity, control cytoplasmic-nuclear protein shuttling, target proteins for degradation or dephosphorylation, and act as scaffolding molecules to couple different proteins together (19Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3061-3064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 22Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Therefore, 14-3-3ζ was a good candidate for a potential downstream effector of tuberin in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade. The direct interaction between 14-3-3ζ and tuberin identified in the yeast two-hybrid system was confirmed by in vitro binding experiments and by co-immunoprecipitation. The binding experiments indicated that tuberin is able to interact with multiple 14-3-3 isoforms and that tuberin contains multiple 14-3-3-binding sites, consistent with Scansite predictions of eight potential consensus 14-3-3-binding motifs in the tuberin amino acid sequence. The presence of multiple 14-3-3-binding sites in tuberin is consistent with the hypothesis that the tuberin-hamartin complex may integrate several different input signals (14Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). In many cases, target protein phosphorylation regulates the binding between 14-3-3 proteins and their targets (19Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3061-3064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 22Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Several pieces of evidence suggest that 14-3-3ζ interacts specifically with phosphorylated isoforms of tuberin. Tuberin is known to be phosphorylated at multiple amino acid residues (4Aicher L.D. Campbell J.S. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21017-21021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar); and in this study, a tuberin mutant that is not phosphorylated correctly did not interact with 14-3-3ζ. In addition, the phosphatase inhibitors NaF and EDTA promoted tuberin/14-3-3ζ binding, whereas a dominant-negative isoform of Akt inhibited tuberin/14-3-3ζ binding. The interaction between phosphorylated tuberin and 14-3-3ζ suggests several possible mechanisms whereby Akt-dependent phosphorylation of tuberin may prevent the inhibition of p70 S6 kinase activity. The consensus Akt substrate recognition motif (RXRXX(S/T)) is similar to the RSXpSXP and RXXXpSXP consensus 14-3-3-binding motifs. Indeed, Scansite analysis predicts three putative Akt substrate motifs in tuberin (Ser939, Ser981, and Ser1338) that are also potential 14-3-3-binding motifs. At least one of these sites (Ser939) has been shown to be a primary site for Akt-dependent phosphorylation of tuberin (14Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Therefore, following phosphorylation of tuberin by Akt, at Ser939 for example, 14-3-3ζ may bind to and prevent the tuberin-mediated inhibition of p70 S6 kinase. 14-3-3ζ may achieve this relief of inhibition in one of several ways. 14-3-3ζ binding may inactivate tuberin directly or target tuberin for degradation (19Tzivion G. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3061-3064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Alternatively, 14-3-3ζ may modify the interactions between tuberin and other binding partners or promote cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of tuberin to physically separate tuberin and p70 S6 kinase. Indeed, phosphorylation-dependent translocation of tuberin to the nucleus has been reported (29Lou D. Griffith N. Noonan D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2001; 4: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both the GST-14-3-3ζ binding assay and the co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the interaction between tuberin and 14-3-3ζ was compatible with tuberin/hamartin binding. However, a direct interaction between hamartin and 14-3-3ζ could not be excluded by either the binding assay or the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. A medium stringency Scansite analysis of the hamartin amino acid sequence identified two potential 14-3-3-binding motifs, RLITEP (amino acids 336–341) and RNKSES (amino acids 1097–1102). However, consistent with only hamartin being retained by the GST-14-3-3ζ beads only as part of the tuberin-hamartin complex, no interaction between hamartin and 14-3-3ζ was detected in the yeast two-hybrid assay. In contrast to the interaction between tuberin and 14-3-3ζ, co-immunoprecipitation of the tuberin-hamartin complex was not affected by the presence of phosphatase inhibitors such as NaF and EDTA, indicating that the mechanism of tuberin/14-3-3ζ binding is distinct from that of tuberin/hamartin binding. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation of tuberin and hamartin was inhibited by Na3VO4, without affecting the direct immunoprecipitation of either protein, indicating that Na3VO4 disrupted the tuberin-hamartin complex. The vanadate ion may disrupt tuberin/hamartin binding by competing with phosphoryl transfer (28Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), suggesting that the tuberin/hamartin interaction may be influenced by the phosphorylation status of one or both proteins, consistent with recent results (15Potter C.J. Pedraza L.G. Xu T. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2002; 4: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). 14-3-3ζ did not interact with a pathogenic tuberin variant containing a R611Q substitution in either the yeast two-hybrid assay or the GST-14-3-3ζ binding experiments. The R611Q substitution also inhibits formation of the tuberin-hamartin complex and alters tuberin phosphorylation (5Nellist M. Verhaaf B. Goedbloed M.A. Reuser A.J.J. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Halley D.J.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2889-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, although the tuberin/14-3-3ζ and tuberin/hamartin interactions appear to be distinct, a single amino acid substitution is sufficient to block both interactions. It is possible that the R611Q substitution may cause a major conformational change that prevents both tuberin/14-3-3ζ and tuberin/hamartin binding as well as the interactions with Akt and possibly other kinases. Alternatively, aberrant phosphorylation of the R611Q variant may inhibit both the tuberin/14-3-3ζ and tuberin/hamartin interactions. A more detailed investigation of the influence ofTSC2 missense mutations on tuberin function is currently in progress. In summary, an interaction between tuberin and 14-3-3ζ was detected using the yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed in vitro and by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The interaction between 14-3-3ζ and tuberin was promoted by the inhibition of phosphatase activity and by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of tuberin, providing a link between tuberin/14-3-3ζ binding and a role for tuberin in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling cascade.

Biophys. 1996; 334: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reported that the NBF of ALDP was located on the cytoplasmic surface of peroxisomal membranes, and that the NBF released from peroxisomes by protease treatment bound to ATP (19Contreras M. Sengupta T.K. Sheikh F. Aubourg P. Singh I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The NBFs of ALDP and PMP70, fused with the maltose-binding protein, were reported to be photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP and showed ATPase activities (20Roerig P. Mayerhofer P.

However, the ATP binding and hydrolysis properties of isolated NBF do not necessarily represent those of complete native proteins. In this study, we analyzed the interaction of peroxisomal ABC transporters with ATP using rat liver peroxisomes. We found that ATP bound to PMP70 and ALDP tightly and that PMP70 and ALDP formed a stable complex with other peroxisomal membranes proteins, which also showed tight ATP binding properties. Furthermore, ATP occluded to homo- and heterodimer of PMP70 and ALDP in the absence of Mg2+ was shown to be hydrolyzed in the presence of Mg2+. PMP70 and ALDP were also phosphorylated at a tyrosine residue(s). 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (18–22 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Affinity Labeling Technologies (Lexington, KY).

Yamada (Kyushu University). Peroxisomes were purified from rat liver by differential centrifugation in a buffer containing sucrose followed by isopycnic centrifugation in Nycodentz (23Imanaka T. Lazarow P.B. Takano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1062: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with some modifications. About 1.0 ml of a light mitochondrial fraction was layered onto a 10 ml linear Nycodentz gradient (density span, 1.15–1.25 g/ml) in a Beckman NVT65T rotor (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). The gradient rested on a 0.5-ml cushion of 1.3 g/ml Nycodentz. All solutions contained 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) ethanol, and 5 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4. The centrifugation was carried out at 51,200 rpm (193,000 ×g) for 120 min at 4 °C. Fractions of ∼1.0 ml were collected in preweighed microtubes, and the density of each fraction was determined by refractometry. The peroxisomal fraction was identified by the density and the distribution of catalase (18Imanaka T. Aihara K. Takano T. Yamashita A. Sato R. Suzuki Y. Yokota S. Osumi T. J. Biol.

After unbound nucleotides were removed before UV irradiation, 500 μl of ice-cold TEM buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm MgSO4) or TEE buffer (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 1.5 mm EDTA) was added to the samples, and the supernatants were removed from peroxisome pellets after centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). This wash step was done again, and then the peroxisomes were resuspended in 8 μl of TEM buffer and exposed to UV light for 3 min (at 254 nm, 5.5 mW/cm2) on ice. The peroxisomes were solubilized, and PMP70 and ALDP were immunoprecipitated as described in the following section. Samples were electrophoresed on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. 8-Azido-[32P]ATP bound to PMP70 and ALDP was measured by scanning with a radioimaging analyzer (BAS2000; Fuji Photo Film Co.). Experiments were carried out at least four times. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Peroxisomes (200 μg) were suspended in 200 μl of a phosphorylation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.4 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmorthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 10 μm ATP) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A). 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was then added to the mixture and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. In some experiments, protein kinase inhibitors at a concentration of 50 μmwere preincubated for 10 min before the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. After centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 5 min, the pellet was washed with the same buffer and suspended with 600 μl of RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitates, prepared as described below, were analyzed on a 7–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel and autoradiographed. The peroxisome pellets were solubilized with 100 μl of RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml (p-amidinophenyl)methanesufonyl fluoride). The lysates were kept on ice or rotated for 1 h, and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were precleared with an appropriate amount of protein G-agarose that was prewashed in RIPA buffer. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 s, the supernatant was incubated with 5 μl of anti-PMP70 or anti-ALDP antibodies for 1 h and then incubated with 20 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein G-agarose for 1 h. Protein and catalase were assayed as described previously (18Imanaka T. Aihara K. Takano T. Yamashita A. Sato R. Suzuki Y. Yokota S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11968-11976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Imanaka T. Shiina Y. Takano T. Hashimoto T. Osumi T. J. Biol.

To examine the interaction of peroxisomal membrane proteins with ATP, rat liver peroxisomes were incubated at 26 °C with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. Then, the peroxisomes were exposed to UV light after removing unbound 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP by washing with excess buffer. Several peroxisomal proteins between 60 and 100 kDa were found to be specifically photoaffinity-labeled (Fig.1 A, lane 1). The intensity of the bands decreased in the presence of an excess amount of ATP in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1 A, lanes 4–7), suggesting that ATP bound to these peroxisomal proteins specifically. Under these conditions, peroxisomal matrix proteins such as hydratase-dehydrogenase, acyl-CoA oxidase, catalase, and urate oxidase were not released from peroxisomal particles (data not shown). Indeed, all the photoaffinity-labeled proteins were recovered in the membrane pellet when the peroxisomes were separated into soluble and membrane fractions by the sodium carbonate procedure (24Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar) (data not shown), suggesting that photoaffinity-labeled proteins were located on the peroxisomal membranes. Western hybridization of the blot, run in parallel, with anti-PMP70 or ALDP antibody showed a single band with a molecular mass of 65 or 75 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2and 3), which could correspond to one of the radiolabeled proteins. PMP70 is a major constituent of peroxisomal membranes of normal rat liver. As compared with the amounts of PMP70, ALDP, ALDRP, and P70R on the membranes, ALDP was about one-seventh the amount of PMP70, and ALDRP and P70R were roughly less than one-tenth the amount of ALDP. 2D. Tomimoto, Y. Murasaki, M. Morita, and T. Imanaka, unpublished observations. To examine whether the photoaffinity-labeled 65- and 75-kDa proteins were PMP70 and ALDP, the proteins labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P] were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against PMP70 and ALDP (Fig.1 B). Both antibodies precipitated mainly four photoaffinity-labeled proteins from 65 to 90 kDa. The anti-PMP70 antibody mainly precipitated a photoaffinity-labeled 65-kDa protein. The photoaffinity-labeled 65-kDa protein was also precipitated by the anti-ALDP antibody, but less efficiently than by the anti-PMP70 antibody. The other three labeled proteins were precipitated at similar efficiencies by these antibodies. Western hybridization of the blot, run in parallel, with anti-PMP70 and anti-ALDP antibodies showed that photoaffinity-labeled 65- and 75-kDa proteins were PMP70 and ALDP, respectively (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 5). Photoaffinity labeling of these proteins was scarcely observed when peroxisomes were incubated with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP at 0 °C and irradiated by UV light after removing unbound nucleotide (data not shown). These results suggest that PMP70 and ALDP bind to ATP tightly in a temperature-dependent manner and form a stable complex together with other peroxisomal membrane proteins, which also bind ATP. To examine the ATP binding properties of PMP70 and ALDP, peroxisomes were incubated with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP or 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP of the same specific radioactivities at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of Mg2+and exposed to UV light before or after unbound nucleotides were removed by washing with excess buffer. Proteins were then immunoprecipitated with anti-PMP70 antibody (Fig.2), and intensities of labeled PMP70 and ALDP were quantitated (Fig. 3). The 65-kDa PMP70 was photoaffinity-labeled at similar efficiencies with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and5) when peroxisomes were incubated with nucleotides in the absence Mg2+ and exposed to UV light without removing unbound nucleotides. The addition of Mg2+ to the reaction mixture reduced photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP by 70% (lane 6 versus lane 5 in Fig. 2 and the left panel of Fig. 3), whereas it reduced photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP by only 20% (lane 2 versus lane 1 in Fig. 2 and the left panelof Fig. 3). These results suggest that ATP binds to PMP70 in the absence of Mg2+ and that γ-phosphate is released from ATP bound to PMP70 in the presence of Mg2+.Figure 3ATP occlusion and hydrolysis in PMP70 (left panel) and ALDP (right panel). 8-Azido-[32P]ATP bound to PMP70 and ALDP (a representative result was shown as Fig. 2) was measured by scanning with a radioimaging analyzer (BAS2000; Fuji Photo Film Co.). Relative photoaffinity labeling of PMP70 and ALDP is expressed as a percentage of that with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the absence of Mg2+ plus UV irradiation without removal of unbound nucleotides (shown in lane 1). The intensity of photoaffinity labeling of ALDP with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the absence of Mg2+and UV irradiation without removal of unbound nucleotides (shown inlane 1) was about 20% of that of PMP70. Experiments were carried out at least four times, and the average values are represented with S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When peroxisomes were incubated with the nucleotides in the absence of Mg2+ and exposed to UV light even after removal of unbound nucleotides, PMP70 was strongly photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (Fig. 2, lane 3). More than 60% of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP remained bound to PMP70 during the washing step (lane 3 versus lane 1 in Fig. 2 and the left panel of Fig. 3). However, more than two-thirds of bound nucleotide was dissociated from PMP70 during the washing step when peroxisomes were reacted with the nucleotide in the presence of Mg2+ (lane 4 versus lane 2 in Fig. 2 and the left panel of Fig. 3). Experiments with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP showed similar results in the absence of Mg2+ (lane 7 versus lane 5in Fig. 2 and the left panel of Fig. 3), although they fluctuated in different experiments. These results suggest that (i) ATP binds to PMP70 tightly in the absence of Mg2+, (ii) the bound ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP in the presence of Mg2+, (iii) the hydrolysis product, 8-azido-ADP, is retained before washing with excess buffer, and (iv) 8-azido-ADP is dissociated from PMP70 during the washing step. Dissociation of 8-azido-ADP from PMP70 suggests a low binding affinity of ADP to PMP70. Properties of photoaffinity labeling of ALDP were similar to those of PMP70, although the intensities of labeled bands of ALDP were about one-fifth of those of PMP70 (Fig. 2 and the right panel of Fig. 3). ATP bound to ALDP tightly in the absence of Mg2+, and that bound ATP was hydrolyzed in the presence of Mg2+, and 8-azido-ADP was dissociated from ALDP. It is well known that MDR1 and MRP1 (ABCC1), the multidrug transporters, trap ADP in the presence of orthovanadate, an analog of phosphate, and Mg2+. As a result, the labeling intensity of these proteins by photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP was increased when membranes containing these proteins were reacted with the nucleotide in the presence of orthovanadate and Mg2+(25Taguchi Y.

Based on this observation, we tried to examine vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping of PMP70 and ALDP. However, no increase of photoaffinity labeling of PMP70 or ALDP was observed when peroxisomes were incubated with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in the presence of orthovanadate and Mg2+ and exposed to UV light before (data not shown) or after unbound nucleotide was removed by washing with excess buffer (Fig.4). Because PMP70 was labeled strongly with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 2) and because some members of the ABC superfamily have been reported to be phosphorylated, we examined whether PMP70 and ALDP were phosphorylated. Peroxisomes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence of Mg2+, and immunoprecipitation was performed with either anti-PMP70 antibody or anti-ALDP antibody. As shown in Fig.5 A, both antibodies precipitated two phospho-proteins corresponding to PMP70 and ALDP (lanes 2 and 7). Co-precipitation of PMP70 and ALDP was revealed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5 B, after immunoprecipitation with anti-PMP70 antibody, PMP70 and ALDP were detected in the immunoprecipitate by Western blotting of either anti-PMP70 antibody or anti-ALDP antibody (lane 2 of theleft and right panels). Both proteins were also detected in the immunoprecipitate with anti-ALDP antibody (lane 3 of the left and right panels). In addition, the phosphorylation of PMP70 and ALDP was markedly inhibited in the presence of lavendustin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but not in the presence of H-7 (a protein kinase C inhibitor), H-89 (a protein kinase A inhibitor), and CKI-7 (a casein kinase I inhibitor) (Fig.5 A, lanes 3–6). These results suggest that PMP70 and ALDP were tyrosine-phosphorylated and existed as a complex. Peroxisomes are involved in oxidative degradation of LCFAs and VLCFAs. LCFAs are known to be activated into CoA derivatives outside of peroxisomes by a LCFA-CoA synthetase before peroxisomal β-oxidation (28Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P. Van Broekhoven A. Vandebroek G. Debeer L.J. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that overexpression of PMP70 in Chinese hamster ovary cells increased the rate of palmitic acid β-oxidation into peroxisomes by 2- to 3-fold and that the peroxisomes prepared from the cells stimulated palmitoyl-CoA β-oxidation. These results suggest that PMP70 is involved in the transport of LCFA-CoA across peroxisomal membranes (18Imanaka T. Aihara K. Takano T. Yamashita A. Sato R. Suzuki Y. Yokota S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11968-11976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). On the other hand, VLCFAs are thought to be activated into CoA derivatives inside of peroxisomes because VLCFA-CoA synthetase locates in peroxisomes facing its active site to the lumimal side (16Smith K.D. Kemp S. Braiterman L.T., Lu, J.F. Wei H.M. Geraghty M. Stetten G. Bergin J.S. Pevsner J. Watkins P.A. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). From several laboratories, it has been reported that oxidation of VLCFAs was reduced by 60–80% in ALD fibroblasts and that oxidation was restored by transfection of ALDP cDNA into the cells, suggesting that ALDP is involved in the metabolism of VLCFA. ALDP could transport VLCFAs across peroxisomal membranes (13Aubourg P. Mandel J.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 461-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Moser H.W. Smith K.D.

ATP was shown to bind to the NBF of ALDP released from peroxisomes by trypsin digestion (19Contreras M. Sengupta T.K. Sheikh F. Aubourg P. Singh I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was also reported that ATP bound to and was hydrolyzed by the recombinant NBFs of PMP70 and ALDP (20Roerig P. Mayerhofer P. Holzinger A. Gartner J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the properties of these proteins against ATP in native states have not yet been characterized. In the present study, we have used photoaffinity labeling of peroxisomes with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP under different conditions, and we have found the following characteristics of native PMP70 and ALDP. (i) 8-azido-ATP is occluded in PMP70 and ALDP in the absence of Mg2+ and is hydrolyzed in the presence of Mg2+. (ii) The hydrolysis product, 8-azido-ADP, is retained in PMP70 and ALDP before removing the excess nucleotides. (iii) PMP70 or ALDP does not form a stable inhibitory complex E-MgADP-Vi after hydrolysis in the presence of orthovanadate to trap 8-azido-ADP. (iv) PMP70 and ALDP exist as homo- or heterodimer and form a stable complex together with other peroxisomal membrane proteins, which also showed tight ATP binding properties. (v) PMP70 and ALDP are tyrosine-phosphorylated by some protein kinase(s) on peroxisomal membranes. ABC proteins have divergent functions and can be classified as transporters, channels, and regulators, although their predicted domain structures and amino acid sequences of their NBFs in a region of about 200 amino acids are well conserved (29Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar, 30Ueda K. Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Kioka N. Amachi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ABC proteins show various properties in ATP binding and hydrolysis, which might explain the divergent functions of ABC proteins. We compared the nucleotide binding/hydrolysis properties of PMP70 and ALDP with those of other eukaryotic ABC proteins. It has been reported that 8-azido-ATP is occluded in the absence Mg2+ in NBF1 of CFTR (ABCC7) (31Szabo K. Szakacs G. Hegeds T. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Aleksandrov L. Mengos A. Chang X. Aleksandrov A. Riordan J.R. J. Biol.

This binding is followed by minimal Mg2+-dependent hydrolysis and retention of the hydrolysis product, 8-azido-ADP, but orthovanadate does not stabilize 8-azido-ADP binding. 8-Azido-ATP occlusion in the absence of Mg2+ was also found in NBF1 of SUR1 and SUR2 (ABCC8, 9) (34Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 35Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), channel regulatory subunits of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel. However, it has not been clear whether NBF1 hydrolyzes ATP because NBF1 was photoaffinity-labeled with both 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Mg2+under the conditions examined (35Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol.

These observations suggest that the nucleotide binding/hydrolysis properties of PMP70 and ALDP resemble those of NBF1 of CFTR and partially resemble those of NBF1 of SUR. Although the nucleotide binding/hydrolysis properties of PMP70 and ALDP resemble those of the NBF1s of CFTR and SUR1, PMP70 and ALDP are different in the combination of two NBFs from CFTR and SUR. In CFTR, in contrast to NBF1, 8-azido-ATP is not occluded at NBF2. 8-Azido-ATP, bound to NBF2, is hydrolyzed in the presence of Mg2+, and 8-azido-ADP dissociates immediately (31Szabo K. Szakacs G. Hegeds T. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Aleksandrov L. Mengos A. Chang X. Aleksandrov A. Riordan J.R. J. Biol.

NBF2 of SUR was photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP but not with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP, suggesting that NBF2 also hydrolyzes ATP immediately (35Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37Matsuo M. Tanabe K. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28757-28763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, CFTR and SUR have two NBFs with different nucleotide binding/hydrolysis properties in a molecule. However, PMP70 works as a homodimer, and PMP70/ALDP works as a heterodimer that has two NBFs with similar nucleotide binding/hydrolysis properties. The prominent eukaryotic ABC protein, which has two NBFs with similar nucleotide binding/hydrolysis properties, is MDR1, a primary active xenobiotics efflux pump. Both NBFs of MDR1 hydrolyze ATP and trap ADP in the presence of orthovanadate equivalently. One ADP-Vi has been reported to be trapped in a molecule (38Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), therefore the NBF at which the initial hydrolysis occurs is supposed to be chosen randomly. Two NBFs of PMP70 homodimer and PMP70/ALDP heterodimer would hydrolyze ATP equivalently. This combination of two NBFs may cause PMP70/PMP70 and PMP70/ALDP to be primary active transporters like MDR1, but not ion channels like CFTR. Recently, Kashiwayama et al. (39Kashiwayama Y. Morita M. Kamijo K. Imanaka T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1245-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) reported that the cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis induced conformational changes in PMP70. The properties of ATP binding and the kinetics of its hydrolysis might be important to the transport of substrates by PMP70 and ALDP. Recently, we succeeded in purifying ABCA1, which is suggested to be involved in cholesterol homeostasis, and found that purified ABCA1 showed ATPase activity. 3K. Takahashi, Y. Kimura, M. Matsuo, and K. Ueda, manuscript in preparation. ABCA1 shows 8-azido-ATP occlusion, but no vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping was observed (40Szakacs G. Langmann T. Ozvegy C. Orso E. Schmitz G. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 4A. R. Tanaka and K. Ueda, unpublished observations. The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis of ABC proteins involved in lipid homeostasis, such as PMP70, ALDP, and ABCA1, could be different from those of MDR1, a xenobiotic transporter. With regard to phosphorylation of ABC proteins, CFTR, channel gating itself, is known to be regulated by phosphorylation. Both TAP1 and TAP2, which are involved in major histocompatibility complex class I antigen processing and presentation, are phosphorylated under physiological conditions, and their function is modulated by reversible TAP phosphorylation (41Li Y. Salter-Cid L. Vitiello A. Preckel T. Lee J.D. Angulo A. Cai Z. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24130-24135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). ATPase activities of CFTR have also been reported to be regulated by protein phosphorylation (42Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Wang W. Garami E. Hewryk M. Lee D. Rommens J.M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28463-28468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PMP70 and ALDP were found to be phosphorylated by incubating peroxisomes with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 5). The phosphorylation of PMP70 and ALDP was markedly inhibited in the presence of lavendustin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. PMP70 and ALDP contain a few tyrosine residues that are potential phosphorylation sites in their amino acid sequence, and one of them is positioned in the cytosolic loop between transmembrane domains 4 and 5. Because purified peroxisomes were used for the experiment, a protein kinase(s) on the peroxisomal membranes is suggested to be involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PMP70 and ALDP. The phosphorylation mechanism of PMP70 and ALDP was distinct from those of CFTR and MDR1, which depend on protein kinase A. The tyrosine phosphorylation of PMP70 and ALDP could be involved in the modulation of their functions. Another important point addressed in the present study is the complex of PMP70 and ALDP together with other peroxisomal proteins. A stable complex of PMP70 and ALDP was supported by the evidence that PMP70 and ALDP were co-immunoprecipitated even after solubilization with RIPA buffer. Western blot analysis after immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5) revealed that more than half of ALDP formed a complex with PMP70 and that at least one-tenth of PMP70 formed a complex with ALDP. The amount of ALDP is about one-seventh that of PMP70 in rat peroxisome,2 and the intensity of photoaffinity labeling of ALDP with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (Fig. 3, lane 1) was about 20% of that of PMP70. Therefore, the labeling stoichiometry of incorporated azido-ATP per mole of PMP70 and ALDP would be roughly calculated to be 1:1. Interestingly, other peroxisomal proteins contained in PMP70·ALDP complexes were also photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (Figs. 1 and 2) but were not phosphorylated (Fig. 5). Among them, a 90-kDa protein was photoaffinity-labeled most strongly. LCFA-CoA and VLCFA-CoA synthetases were candidates for the proteins. However, Western blotting with antibodies against these enzymes did not recognize the photoaffinity-labeled proteins (data not shown). ALDRP and P70R are not likely to be the strongly photoaffinity-labeled proteins because their molecular masses are lower than that of ALDP and because their amounts in peroxisomal membranes are less than one-tenth that of ALDP.2 Although we have not yet identified the proteins, one of the photoaffinity-labeled proteins could be a tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates PMP70 and ALDP. It has been reported that tapasin, class I heterodimers, and a protein kinase are contained in the phosphorylated TAP-containing complexes and that phosphorylation is involved in the formation of protein complexes (41Li Y.

Recently, it has been shown that several proteins involved in the biogenesis of peroxisomes interacted with each other and formed stable protein complexes in the peroxisomal membranes (43Reguenga C. Oliveira M.E. Gouveia A.M., Sa- Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29935-29942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The complex solubilized by the detergents showed a molecular mass of ∼400 kDa on sucrose gradient and ∼700 kDa on blue-native PAGE. Previously, we found that PMP70 solubilized with peroxisomal membranes with 0.5% C12E9 showed two peaks with molecular mass of ∼500 kDa and 160–200 kDa by gel filtration on superose 6 prep HR15/50 column (44Shimizu S. Imanaka T. Takano T. Ohkuma S. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is possible that the former is a complex of several proteins including PMP70, ALDP, and other proteins and that the latter is homo- or heterodimer of PMP70 and ALDP. In this study, we found that PMP70 and ALDP formed a stable complex together with some peroxisomal proteins and bound to and hydrolyzed ATP with a unique manner. Furthermore, we found that PMP70 and ALDP were tyrosine-phosphorylated. Formation of the complex and phosphorylation of PMP70 and ALDP are expected to be involved in the regulation of fatty acid transport into peroxisomes. We thank Dr. T. Yamada for anti-ALDP antibody."

The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of myelin basic protein (MBP)-primed T cells in the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in microglial cells. MBP-primed T cells alone markedly induced the production of NO and the expression of iNOS protein and mRNA in mouse BV-2 microglial cells. Similarly, MBP-primed T cells also induced the production of NO in mouse primary microglia. This induction of NO production was primarily dependent on the contact between MBP-primed T cells and microglia. The expression of very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) on the surface of MBP-primed T cells and inhibition of MBP-primed T cell-induced microglial NO production by functional blocking of antibodies to the α4 chain of VLA-4 (CD49d) suggest that VLA-4 integrin on MBP-primed T cells plays an important role in contact-mediated induction of iNOS.

At low concentrations, NO has been shown to play a unique role in neurotransmission and vasodilation; however, at higher concentrations, it is a potent neurotoxin (1Nathan C.

The reaction of NO with O2− forms peroxynitrite, ONOO−, a strong nitrosating agent capable of nitrosating tyrosine residues of a protein to nitrotyrosine. Increased levels of nitrotyrosine have been found in demyelinating lesions of MS brains as well as in spinal cords of mice with EAE (12Brenner T. Brocke S. Szafer F. Sobel R.A. Parkinson J.F.

Consistently, uric acid, a scavenger of peroxynitrite, markedly inhibits the appearance of EAE in mice, and the incidence of MS has been found very rare among gout patients having higher levels of uric acid, suggesting the critical involvement of peroxynitrite in the disease process of EAE and MS. Subsequently, semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR for iNOS mRNA in MS brains also shows markedly higher expression of iNOS mRNA in MS brains than in normal brains (14Brosan C.F. Battistini L.

MS is the most common human autoimmune disease of the CNS of unknown etiology. The infiltration of neuroantigen-specific T cells into the CNS is considered a key event in the pathogenesis of MS or EAE (16Utz U. McFarland H.F. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 53: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Chabot S. Yong V.W. Neurology. 2000; 55: 1497-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms through which neuroantigen-specific T cells play an etiologic role in MS remain unclear. Since NO produced in excessive amount from the activation of iNOS participates in the pathogenesis of MS, we investigated the role of neuroantigen-specific T cells in the expression of iNOS in microglial cells.We herein report that MBP-primed T cells induce the expression of iNOS in mouse microglial cells through cell-cell contact and that very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) on the T cell surface plays an important role in this process. Interestingly, interferon-β (IFN-β) inhibited the expression of VLA-4 and thereby blocked the ability of MBP-primed T cells to induce microglial iNOS.DISCUSSIONActivation of microglia, CNS-resident professional macrophages, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease, Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, and human immunodeficiency virus dementia (37Gonzalez-Scarano F. Baltuch G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Upon activation, microglia produce and secrete potentially neuroinflammatory molecules including NO that play a pivotal role in demyelination of MS patients (7Merrill J.E. Ignarro L.J. Sherman M.P. Melinek J. Lane T.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2132-2141PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jana M. Liu X. Koka S. Ghosh S. Petro T.M. Pahan K. J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12041-12045Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) have shown that iNOS-expressing cells in MS brains were predominantly, but not exclusively, microglia/macrophages. Therefore, understanding the mechanism by which iNOS is induced in CNS microglia of MS patients can thus impact upon the rational treatment of the disease. However, the mechanism by which microglia are activated to induce the expression of iNOS for the production of NO in MS brain remains unclear. Although lipopolysaccharide is a potent inducer of iNOS in microglia, it has not been demonstrated to have a physiological relevance in MS (39Martin R. McFarland H.F. McFarlin D.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). IFN-γ, alone or in combinations with other proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β, can also induce iNOS in microglia (7Merrill J.E. Ignarro L.J. Sherman M.P. Melinek J. Lane T.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2132-2141PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jana M. Liu X. Koka S. Ghosh S. Petro T.M. Pahan K. J. Biol.

Invest. 1997; 100: 2671-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar); however, microglia isolated from adult human brain tend to be a poor source of iNOS-derived NO in response to these proinflammatory cytokines (40Zhao M.L. Liu J.S., He, D. Dickson D.W. Lee S.C. Brain Res. 1998; 813: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 41Peterson P.K., Hu, S. Anderson W.R. Chao C.C. J. Infect Dis. 1994; 170: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that apart from proinflammatory cytokines, microglia can be activated by some other mechanism(s) for the induction of iNOS in the CNS of MS patients.The infiltration of neuroantigen-specific T cells into the CNS is considered a key event in the pathogenesis of MS or EAE. However, the biological role of such T cells within the CNS is poorly understood. Several lines of evidence presented in this manuscript clearly support the conclusion that MBP-primed T cells potently induce the expression of iNOS in microglial cells through cell-cell contact. This conclusion is based on the following observations. First, MBP-primed T cells induce the production of NO and the expression of iNOS through the activation of NFκB in mouse microglial cells. This effect was dose-dependent, and it peaked at 0.7:1 or 0.5:1 of T cell:microglia. In contrast, normal T cells were unable to induce the production of NO and the expression of iNOS. Second, the placement of MBP-primed T cells in a culture insert, where they were in close proximity to but not contacting microglia, was unable to induce the production of NO in microglial cells. Third, soluble factors of MBP-primed T cells equivalent to T cells of 0.5:1 or 0.7:1 of T cell:microglia were very poor inducers of NO.Integrins and adhesion molecules are involved in cell-cell interaction. It has been shown that an increased number of lymphocytes express VLA-4 in active MS lesions (42Sedgwick J.D. Ford A.L. Foulcher E. Airriess R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5320-5330PubMed Google Scholar) and that blocking VLA-4 function with a monoclonal antibody prevents experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS, in mice (43Traugott U. Reinherz E.L. Raine C.S. Science. 1983; 218: 308-310Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Consistently, short term treatment of MS patients with anti-α4 integrin antibody significantly reduces BBB dysfunction as assessed by contrast-enhanced MRI (44Cannella B. Raine C.S. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Earlier, Yong and colleagues (34Chabot S. Williams G. Yong V.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have reported that this VLA-4-VCAM-1 interaction plays a crucial role when anti-CD3-stimulated T cells activate microglia through cell-cell contact, prompting us to investigate the role of VLA-4 in neuroantigen-primed T cell-induced microglial production of NO. The observations presented in this manuscript that MBP-primed T cells expressed VLA-4 on their surface and that blocking of that VLA-4 by neutralizing antibodies against the α4 chain of VLA-4 inhibited the ability of MBP-primed T cells to induce the production of NO clearly suggest that VLA-4 integrin on the surface of neuroantigen-primed T cells plays an important role in contact-mediated induction of iNOS in microglia. NO, being a major mediator in immune and autoimmune functions, has also been shown to increase the permeability of the BBB, allowing substances to enter into the brain passively, leading to vasogenic edema and secondary brain damage (45Yednock T. Cannon C. Fritz L. Sanchez-Madrid R. Steinman L. Karin N. Nature. 1992; 356: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Although the precise molecular mechanisms for NO-induced breakdown of the BBB are not completely understood, in a cell culture model of the BBB, NO leads to a rapid breakdown in model barrier integrity and resulted in a reduction in cellular ATP content and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (46Tubridy N. Behan P.O. Capildeo R. Chaudhuri A. Forbes R. Hawkins C.P. Hughes R.A.C. Palace J. Sharrack B. Swingler R. Young C. Moseley I.F. MacManus D.G. Donoghue S. Miller D.H. Neurology. 1999; 53: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If these cell culture studies have significance in vivo in the CNS of EAE and MS, it is possible that neuroantigen-primed T cells may increase the permeability of BBB through contact-mediated induction of NO production in microglia and astroglia 2S. Dasgupta and K. Pahan, unpublished observation. present near the BBB junction.Sedgwick et al. (42Sedgwick J.D. Ford A.L. Foulcher E. Airriess R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5320-5330PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that microglia and T cells do interact in vivo. In the graft-versus-host disease model, activated microglia were found to cluster around T cell infiltrates and to be associated with single or clustered microglia (42Sedgwick J.D. Ford A.L. Foulcher E. Airriess R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5320-5330PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, microglia isolated from animals of graft-versus-host disease proliferated and exhibited functions of activated microglia, such as phagocytosis and motility (42Sedgwick J.D. Ford A.L. Foulcher E. Airriess R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5320-5330PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these in vivo observations and the proximity of activated T cells and microglia in the perivascular space or CNS parenchyma of MS lesions (48Hurst R.D. Azam S. Hurst A. Clark J.B. Brain Res. 2001; 894: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the induction of iNOS by the contact between MBP-primed T cells and microglia described in this manuscript is relevant to MS pathogenesis. The in vitromodel of our study used a 0.5:1 or 0.7:1 ratio of neuroantigen-primed T cells to microglia, and at present, it is unclear whether this is a relevant ratio. Depending on the fact that microglia constitute only 2–5% of total CNS cells in normal brain (37Gonzalez-Scarano F. Baltuch G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), the present study suggests that infiltration of very few neuroantigen-primed T cells would be sufficient to activate CNS microglia for contact-mediated induction of iNOS.Several studies have shown that IFN-β decreases the number of relapses and MRI-detected lesions in relapsing/remitting MS patients (35Yong V.W. Chabot S. Stuve O. Williams G. Neurology. 1998; 51: 682-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Paty D.W. Li D.K.B. Neurology. 1993; 43: 662-667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Rudick R.A. Carpenter C.S. Cookfair D.L. Tuohy V.K. Ransohoff R.M. Neurology. 1996; 43: 2080-2087Crossref Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism(s) by which IFN-β is effective in the treatment of MS have remained unclear. It has been suggested that IFN-β attenuates the disease process of MS probably through mediating systemic immunity (50IFN Neurology. 1993; 43: 655-661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), decreasing T cell reactivity to produce IFN-γ (51Noronha A. Toscas A. Jensen M.A. J. Neuroimmunol. 1993; 46: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), stimulating the production of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine (17Chabot S. Yong V.W. Neurology. 2000; 55: 1497-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), inhibiting antigen presentation to T cells (52Noronha A. Toscas A. Jensen M.A. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), or modifying humoral immune response (53O'Gorman M.R.G. Oger J. Kastrukoff L.F. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1987; 67: 66-67PubMed Google Scholar). Our current results have underlined another important mechanism by which IFN-β may be efficient in MS. In this regard, IFN-β blocks the ability of neuroantigen-primed T cells to induce contact-mediated production of the oligodendrocyte-toxic molecule, NO, in microglia by inhibiting the expression of VLA-4 on the surface of neuroantigen-primed T cells. It is not known whether IFN-β can penetrate the blood-brain barrier. However, we have found that IFN-β alone can induce the production of NO and the activation of NFκB (data not shown) in microglial cells, suggesting that apart from inhibiting the functions of activated T cells, if IFN-β itself can enter into the CNS, it may augment the inflammatory response. Consistent with our observation, it has been found that IFN-β is beneficial in relapsing/remitting MS but not in acute MS attacks (54Whitaker J.N. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 36: S103-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 55Connelly J.F. Ann. Pharmacother. 1994; 28: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) when the integrity of the blood-brain barrier is questionable.Consistent with the inhibitory effect of IFN-β on the surface expression of VLA-4 in neuroantigen-primed T cells (Fig. 5), after analyzing the cell surface expression of VLA-4 by flow cytometry in 10 MS patients before and during IFN-β treatment, Calabresi et al. (56Calabresi P.A. Pelfrey C.M. Tranquill L.R. Maloni H. McFarland H.F. Neurology. 1997; 49: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have shown that the mean VLA-4 fluorescence of the lymphocytes of MS patients decreases on treatment as compared with untreated controls. However, this inhibitory effect of IFN-β on surface expression of VLA-4 was absent in in vitrostudies with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (56Calabresi P.A. Pelfrey C.M. Tranquill L.R. Maloni H. McFarland H.F. Neurology. 1997; 49: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). By Western blot analysis, Chabot et al. (34Chabot S. Williams G. Yong V.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have reported that the total cellular level of the 80-kDa CD49d is lower (about 40%) in T lymphocytes treated with IFN-β than in untreated cells. In contrast, under the same condition, the cell surface levels of α4integrin as assessed by flow cytometry were not affected (34Chabot S. Williams G. Yong V.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), leading to the speculation that IFN-β treatment might affect the affinity of integrin molecules without altering their expression on the cell surface. However, in our experiment, IFN-β treatment has been found to inhibit the mean VLA-4 fluorescence on the surface of neuroantigen (MBP)-primed T cells as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5). The only difference between these two studies is that activated T cells were incubated with IFN-β for 3 days in the former study by Chabotet al. (34Chabot S. Williams G. Yong V.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) but for 4 days in the present one (Fig. 5). Therefore, this discrepancy about the effect of IFN-β on surface expression of VLA-4 in T cells could be explained by the possible complexity involved in the turnover of cell surface integrins.NO and peroxynitrite (a reaction product of NO and O2−) are potentially toxic molecules to neurons and oligodendrocytes that may mediate toxicity through the formation of iron-NO complexes of iron containing enzyme systems, oxidation of protein sulfhydryl groups, nitration of proteins, and nitrosylation of nucleic acids and DNA strand breaks (2Jaffrey S.R.

NO derived from microglia has also been implicated in the damage of myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in demyelinating disorders such as MS (7Merrill J.E. Ignarro L.J. Sherman M.P. Melinek J. Lane T.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2132-2141PubMed Google Scholar). Because neuroantigen-primed T cells infiltrate into the CNS of MS patients, the induction of iNOS expression by MBP-primed T cells in microglia suggests that neuroantigen-primed T cells may induce the neural injury in the inflamed CNS through the induction of NO production. Nitric oxide (NO),1 a short-lived and bioactive free radical, has been recognized to have many functions in normal physiological and pathophysiological conditions (1Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar, 2Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). At low concentrations, NO has been shown to play a unique role in neurotransmission and vasodilation; however, at higher concentrations, it is a potent neurotoxin (1Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar,2Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Consistently, NO, derived in excessive amounts from the activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in glial cells (microglia and astrocytes), is assumed to contribute to oligodendrocyte degeneration in demyelinating diseases and neuronal death during neurodegenerative diseases (3Galea E.

Evidence from several laboratories emphasizes the involvement of NO in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS (8Kolb H.

Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid from MS patients has shown increased levels of nitrite and nitrate as compared with normal control (11Johnson A.W. Land J.M. Thompson E.J. Bolanos J.P. Clark J.B. Heales S.J.R. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1995; 58: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The reaction of NO with O2− forms peroxynitrite, ONOO−, a strong nitrosating agent capable of nitrosating tyrosine residues of a protein to nitrotyrosine. Increased levels of nitrotyrosine have been found in demyelinating lesions of MS brains as well as in spinal cords of mice with EAE (12Brenner T. Brocke S. Szafer F. Sobel R.A. Parkinson J.F. Perez D.H. Steinman L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2940-2946PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hooper D.C. Scott G.S. Zborek A. Mikheeva T. Kean R.B. Koprowski H. Spitsin S.V. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Consistently, uric acid, a scavenger of peroxynitrite, markedly inhibits the appearance of EAE in mice, and the incidence of MS has been found very rare among gout patients having higher levels of uric acid, suggesting the critical involvement of peroxynitrite in the disease process of EAE and MS. Subsequently, semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR for iNOS mRNA in MS brains also shows markedly higher expression of iNOS mRNA in MS brains than in normal brains (14Brosan C.F. Battistini L.

Trapp B.D. Ann. Neurol. 1994; 36: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which NO is generated in the MS brain is unclear, but it is known that the resident CNS macrophage, the microglia, is an important source. MS is the most common human autoimmune disease of the CNS of unknown etiology. The infiltration of neuroantigen-specific T cells into the CNS is considered a key event in the pathogenesis of MS or EAE (16Utz U. McFarland H.F. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 53: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Chabot S. Yong V.W. Neurology. 2000; 55: 1497-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms through which neuroantigen-specific T cells play an etiologic role in MS remain unclear. Since NO produced in excessive amount from the activation of iNOS participates in the pathogenesis of MS, we investigated the role of neuroantigen-specific T cells in the expression of iNOS in microglial cells. We herein report that MBP-primed T cells induce the expression of iNOS in mouse microglial cells through cell-cell contact and that very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) on the T cell surface plays an important role in this process. Interestingly, interferon-β (IFN-β) inhibited the expression of VLA-4 and thereby blocked the ability of MBP-primed T cells to induce microglial iNOS. DISCUSSIONActivation of microglia, CNS-resident professional macrophages, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease, Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, and human immunodeficiency virus dementia (37Gonzalez-Scarano F. Baltuch G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Upon activation, microglia produce and secrete potentially neuroinflammatory molecules including NO that play a pivotal role in demyelination of MS patients (7Merrill J.E. Ignarro L.J. Sherman M.P.

https://openalex.org/W1972247421,"To detect altered gene expression associated with mouse lung tumor progression, we compared the gene expression profile of lung adenocarcinomas with that of lung adenomas and normal lungs. Autoradiographic analysis showed that among the 588 genes surveyed, 152 genes were detected and the remaining 436 genes did not give any signals. A gene-specific semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method was used to confirm the expression profile. A total of 29 genes was found to be differentially expressed in mouse lung tumors when compared to normal lungs. The pattern of expression, either underexpression or overexpression, was the same for 10 genes between adenocarcinomas and adenomas. Among them, seven genes were overexpressed, two genes were underexpressed and one gene was lost. Interestingly, 19 genes showed differential expression or increased incidence or difference in level of change between lung adenomas and adenocarcinomas, including Stat1, ADAP, IGFBP-6, PDGF-A, TGF-beta2, Int-3, VEGFR2, BAX, BAG-1, c-Jun, FasL, TRAIL, YB-1, CD31, Cdc42, B-raf, Rab-2, Abi-1, and ACE. These genes can be designated as candidate 'lung tumor progression' (LTP) genes because their expression changes may specifically affect lung tumor progression in mice. Further analyses of these candidate LTP genes may provide new leads for elucidation of lung tumor progression in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2048628659,"A recent large multi-centre study convincingly confirmed previous observations that the SYT-SSX1 fusion type, compared to SYT-SSX2, of synovial sarcoma is associated with a worse clinical outcome. Apart from the clinical impact, this fact also suggests (1) that the SYT-SSX fusion gene may influence molecular mechanisms involved in tumour growth and progression; and (2) that the SYT-SSX1 fusion type has a stronger influence on these mechanisms than SYT-SSX2. The nature of the underlying mechanisms is, however, still unknown. In this study we made use of the SYT-SSX1 vs SYT-SSX2 concept to investigate whether major, tumour relevant, and growth regulatory proteins (e.g. cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases) may be involved. Using Western blotting analysis on 74 fresh, fusion variant-typed, tumour samples from localized synovial sarcoma, we found a significant correlation between SYT-SSX1 and high expression of cyclin A (P=0.003) and D1 (P=0.025). Our data suggest that SYT-SSX may influence the cell cycle machinery, and that the more aggressive phenotype of the SYT-SSX1 variant is due to an accelerated tumour cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2315942857,"In this study we show that E6 of human papillomavirus has the ability to deregulate the cell cycle G1/S transition. In rodent immortalized fibroblasts (NIH3T3) serum deprivation or over-expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p16INK4a or p27KIP1, leads to G1 cell cycle arrest. HPV16 E6 overcomes the antiproliferative signals, gaining the ability to drive serum-deprived and p16INK4a or p27KIP1 over-expressing cells into S phase. E6 protein from the benign HPV type 1 displays a similar activity to HPV16 E6 to deregulate the G1/S transition. Thus, this activity appears to be conserved between E6 proteins from non-oncogenic and oncogenic HPV types. Furthermore, we show that HPV16 E6 is not able to circumvent a G1 arrest imposed by pRb mutant in which all CDK phosphorylation sites have been mutated. These data indicate that the viral protein acts upstream of pRb and its mechanism in promoting cell cycle progression is dependent on pRb phosphorylation. In summary, this study describes a novel biological function of HPV E6 and shows that the S phase entry, required for viral DNA replication, is not exclusively controlled by E7, but that E6 also is involved in this event."

Structure determinations of this single domain response regulator at different pH values demonstrated that the five-stranded α/β fold of the DivK protein is fully defined only at acidic pH. The crystal structures of the apoprotein and of metal-bound DivK complexes at higher pH values revealed a synergistic pH- and cation binding-induced flexibility of the β4-α4 loop and of the α4 helix.

Taken together, these results suggest that flexibility of critical regions of the protein, ionization of the cysteine 99 residue and improved K D values for the catalytic metal ion are coupled events.

N-(maleimidylethyl)-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-oxazol-2-yl) pyridinium methanesulfonate 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid root mean square The so-called two-component systems constitute widespread signaling cascades in microorganisms. These systems are generally represented by a sensor protein with histidine autokinase activity and a cognate response regulator (1Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar, 2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). The sensor protein is autophosphorylated on a conserved histidine residue, and the response regulator is activated by phosphorylation on the conserved aspartate residue in a Mg2+-dependent transphosphorylation reaction from the phosphohistidine of the cognate kinase. Phosphorylation of the response regulator elicits the appropriate cellular response through protein-protein interactions with downstream partners, or by activating or repressing gene(s) expression (3West A.H. Stock A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 4Foussard M. Cabantous S. Pedelacq J. Guillet V. Tranier S. Mourey L. Birck C. Samama J. Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These His-Asp phosphorelay pathways mediate a wide array of physiological processes, most commonly in response to environmental conditions and external stimuli (5Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). There is now evidence that the His-Asp family of proteins also plays essential roles in the regulation of the cell division cycle and cell differentiation in the Gram-negative aquatic bacteriumCaulobacter crescentus. Cell cycle progression in these bacteria proceeds by a series of discrete morphogenic events and culminates in an asymmetric cell division to produce an new mother stalked cell plus a new motile swarmer cell (reviewed in Refs. 6Newton A. Ohta N. Inouye M. Histidine Kinases in Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York2002Google Scholar and7Hung D. McAdams H. Shapiro L. Brun Y.V. Shimkets L. Prokaryotic Development. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 361-378Google Scholar). The two progeny cells inherit identical genomes but express different genetic programs. After cell division, the stalked cell immediately initiates DNA synthesis and develops into a predivisional asymmetric cell. The sibling swarmer cell, by contrast, is silent for DNA synthesis and does not initiate chromosome replication until undergoing a series of developmental events, including loss of motility, shedding of the flagellum, and formation of the cellular stalk (8Degnen S.T. Newton A. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 64: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this bacterium, multiple histidine kinases and response regulators make up a network of signal transduction pathways that couple the execution of successive developmental events to cell cycle progression (reviewed in Refs. 6Newton A. Ohta N. Inouye M. Histidine Kinases in Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York2002Google Scholar and 9Huguenel E.D. Newton A. Differentiation. 1982; 21: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The essential, single domain response regulator DivK plays a central role in the phosphorelay pathways controlling both cell division and motility (10Hecht G.B. Lane T. Ohta N. Sommer J.M. Newton A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). DivK belongs to the same protein subfamily as the response regulators CheY, which is involved in chemotaxis (11Stock A.M. Mottonen J.M. Stock J.B. Schutt C.E. Nature. 1989; 337: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and spo0F, which is required for sporulation in Bacillus subtilis (12Hoch J.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 441-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These regulatory domains generally contain ∼130 amino acids and share a doubly wound α/β fold (5Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). Genetic results indicate that DivK functions downstream of histidine kinases PleC and DivJ (10Hecht G.B. Lane T. Ohta N. Sommer J.M. Newton A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Sommer J.M. Newton A. Genetics. 1991; 129: 623-630PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wu J. Ohta N. Newton A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1443-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The purified cytoplasmic domains of PleC and DivJ efficiently phosphorylate DivK in the presence of ATP and dephosphorylate phospho-DivK (10Hecht G.B. Lane T. Ohta N. Sommer J.M. Newton A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Consistent with the latter findings is the observation that DivK phosphorylation in whole cells is largely dependent on the DivJ kinase (15Wheeler R.T. Shapiro L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recent results have also shown that the PleC and DivJ kinases, as well as the DivK protein, are dynamically localized within C. crescentus cells during the cell cycle (15Wheeler R.T. Shapiro L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16Jacobs C. Hung D. Shapiro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4095-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although not yet demonstrated experimentally, the subcellular distribution of His-Asp proteins, along with modulation of the kinase and phosphatase activities of these signal transduction components, may be critical for the control of the activation pathways (Ref. 7Hung D. McAdams H. Shapiro L. Brun Y.V. Shimkets L. Prokaryotic Development. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 361-378Google Scholar, reviewed in Ref. 17Ohta N. Grebe T.W. Newton A. Brun Y. Shimkets L. Prokaryotic Development. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 341-359Google Scholar). In this report, we present several three-dimensional structures of DivK in its metal-free and metal-bound forms at different pH values. The metal-free response regulator adopts a stable fold only at pH 6.0, and the x-ray structures of the protein at higher pH values document atomic motions at critical regions of the response regulator. Coordination of the catalytic metal ion in the active site was unusual and increased the flexibility of the protein. The observations provided by the structures of the metal-bound species are consistent with the biochemical investigations which revealed a major pH dependence of theK D value of the protein for the metal ion. The results collectively suggest a direct coupling between metal ion binding, flexibility of helix α4, and ionization of the single cysteine residue in the protein. These data provide new insights into the possible modulation of DivK activation throughout the cell cycle.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The mask was automatically calculated assuming a solvent content of 26% in the unit cell. The resulting electron density allowed chain tracing for most parts of the polypeptide chain, except for a stretch of 15 residues corresponding to the fourth helix and the preceding loop. A polyalanine model was built in the experimental (3Fo − 2Fc) electron density map displayed on a Silicon Graphics work station using TURBO-FRODO (22Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 71-78Google Scholar). The initial experimental phases, and those derived from this model, were combined using the program SIGMAA (23Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) and improved the quality of electron density map. This process was repeated until 72% of the residues (60% of the atoms) were built. This model was refined using CNS (24Brünger A.T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) including anisotropic B factor and bulk-solvent correction. About 10% of the data set was excluded from the refinement and used for the calculation of the free R factor (25Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). The high resolution data were progressively introduced during refinement and solvent molecules, with density higher than 4ς, were included in the last stages. In the protein structure at pH 7.0 solved to 1.8 Å resolution, there was no electron density for residues 84–90, and for the side chain of residues 101, 102, and 105. The final R andR free values were 21.5% and 25.7%, respectively, and the average temperature factor for all protein atoms was 18.0 Å2 (Table II). The refinement of the structure of the protein at pH 6.0 was performed using CNS (24Brünger A.T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) using as starting model the structure of the protein at pH 7.0. The final Rand R free values at 1.6 Å resolution were 19.1 and 21.2%, respectively (Table II). This monomer is fully defined from residues 2–125. The average temperature factor for all protein atoms was 12.3 Å2. The mean coordinate error was estimated to be less than 0.18 Å (26Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar). All residues belong to the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, except Gln-55. The side chains of residues Lys-3, Ser-37, Met-52, Asp-71, and Ile-116 were modeled as two-state conformers. The native DivK structures at pH 8.0 and pH 8.5 were refined to 1.87 and 1.65 Å, respectively, using the structure at pH 6.0 as starting model. There was no electron density for the region 84–93 and 84–89 at pH 8.0 and 8.5, respectively.Table IIRefinement statisticsDatapH 6pH 7pH 8pH 8.5NativeMnCl2 (20 mm)NativeMnCl2 (20 mm)NativeMgCl2 (20 mm)MnCl2 (1 mm)MnCl2 (10 mm)NativeMgCl2 (20 mm)MnCl2 (10 mm)Resolution (Å)1.61.61.81.51.871.782.282.001.651.411.34No. of protein atoms971901869860875865833829869869835No. of solvent molecules12083746864722537696365No. of reflections work/test11,560/1,32811,638/1,3418,523/98412,473/1,4147,169/8548,421/9473,066/3435,224/64910,574/1,20215,533/1,69818,323/2,027Rfactor/Rfree(%)19.1/21.220.7/22.321.5/25.721.5/24.818.8/20.719.2/22.419.6/26.820.6/24.321.0/23.020.7/21.423.0/24.2Mean temperature factor (Å2)12.320.218.018.923.122.834.133.524.715.914.4Metal ion occupancy0.490.620.320.640.690.41/0.44aOccupancies refined assuming two mutually exclusive metal binding sites in the protein active site.0.68/0.26aOccupancies refined assuming two mutually exclusive metal binding sites in the protein active site.Cation peak height (°)15.318.66.210.915.98.5/6.525.4/10.9a Occupancies refined assuming two mutually exclusive metal binding sites in the protein active site. Open table in a new tab The Mg2+ or Mn2+ derivatives at pH 6.0, pH 7.0, pH 8.0, and pH 8.5 were refined using the same procedures. The electron density of the manganese ion was the highest positive peak in theFo − Fc SIGMAA weighted map (Table II). The metal was introduced in the last stages of refinement. Statistics of the structure refinements are presented in Table II. The figures illustrating the protein structure were produced by BOBSCRIPT (27Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession numbers: 1M5T, 1M5U, 1MAV, 1MB0, and 1MB3). Steady-state fluorescence measurements were made using a P.T.I. (Photon Technology International) fluorescence spectrophotometer. The experiments were performed at pH 6.0, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5. Manganese (MnCl2) was added stepwise to a 2-ml cuvette containing DivK (2 μm) in buffer. After each addition, the cuvette was incubated for 5 min at 4 °C using a thermostated stirred cell holder and the fluorescence of the single tryptophan in the protein (Trp-67) was measured (excitation wavelength = 295 nm, emission wavelength = 348 nm, bandwidth = 4 nm). The fluorescence data were fitted to the following Equation 1, (F0−Fcorr)/(F0−F∞corr)=KSV×[Q]/(1+KSV[Q])Equation 1 where Fcorr is the value of F corrected for the dilution, F∞ the fluorescence at infinite quencher concentration, [Q] the metal ion concentration in mm and KSV the Stern-Volmer constant in mm−1, the reciprocal of the dissociation constant. The plots of the modified Stern-Volmer data provided the dissociation constant (K D) at each pH value (TableIII).Table IIIKD values of Mn2+ and Mg2+ for DivK at different pH valuespHKDMn2+Mg2+mm6.040.5 ± 2.57.041.0 ±2.07.511.8 ± 1.78.01.34 ± 0.1647 ± 2.58.50.21 ± 0.0926 ± 2.0 Open table in a new tab A monomer-dimer mixture of DivK was obtained by dialysis of the protein (60 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl. This mixture was reacted with a 5-fold molar excess of the fluorescent probe PyMPO for 45 min at room temperature. The concentration of the stock solution of PyMPO (10 mm in Me2SO) was determined spectrophotometrically (ε412 = 23,000m−1·cm−1). The products of the reaction were analyzed on non-reducing 15% SDS-PAGE. The fluorescence of free and DivK-bound PyMPO was measured using a STORM 840 gel imaging system (Molecular Dynamics, San Jose, CA) and the blue light as the excitation source. The digitized data were analyzed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Proteins were revealed by silver staining. CD studies were performed using a Jobin-Yvon CD6 dichrograph at 20 °C. Spectra from 195 to 260 nm were recorded (0.2 nm·s−1) using a quartz cell with an optical pathlength of 1 mm. Solutions of DivK in 20 mm MES pH 6.0 or 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, at concentrations varying from 120 to 500 μg/ml, were used. The spectra were smoothed using the software supplied by the manufacturer (CD6 software). Each spectrum was the result of 5 scans using a bandwidth of 4 nm. The DivK protein crystallized in the orthorhombic P212121 space group with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Crystallization occurred only at pH 6.0 but once formed, the crystals could be manipulated at pH values as high as 8.5 without alteration of the diffraction pattern. The structure was solved using multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (MIRAS) phasing (TableI). The structures presented in this report were refined at resolutions ranging between 2.3 and 1.35 Å, with standard values for the R,R free, and mean temperature factors (Table II). There are two major crystal packing contacts. The first one is provided by one direct and three water-mediated hydrogen bonds between strand β2 from one molecule and residues 57–60 from the γ-loop of a symmetry-related molecule. The second one involves van der Waals contacts between the indole ring of Trp-67 in one molecule and the side chains of Glu-12 and Arg-33 of an adjacent molecule. These features were observed at all pH values. The atomic positions in the metal-free protein were all defined only at pH 6.0. The 125 residues of DivK adopt a doubly wound 5-stranded α/β fold, with helices α1 and α5 on one side of the sheet and helices α2, α3, and α4 on the other side (Fig.1). Helices α1, α2, α3, and α5 are N-capped by the side chains of residues Asn-11, Glu-58, Ser-60, and Ser-108, respectively. The cleft defined by loops β1-α1, β3-α3, β4-α4, and β5-α5 constitutes the active site of DivK (Fig. 1). It contains Glu-9, a residue that is commonly an aspartic acid in this protein family, Asp-10 and Asp-53 (the site of phosphorylation). The carboxylate groups of Glu-9 and Asp-53 are hydrogen bonded to the main chain nitrogen atoms of Asn-11 from loop β1-α1 and Gln-55 from the β3-α3 loop, respectively (Fig. 2). The side chain of Asp-10 points outside the active site and forms a salt-bridge interaction with Arg-33. Three water molecules are bound in the acidic pocket (Fig. 2). Water1 (Wat1) is coordinated to the carboxylate group of Glu-9, to the main chain nitrogen atom of Asp-10 and to Wat2. The Wat2 molecule is hydrogen bonded to the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Gln-55. The third water molecule (Wat3) bridges the side chains of Asp-53, Gln-55, and Lys-105. A salt-bridge interaction links Asp-53 and Lys-105, two invariant residues in response regulators. The hydroxyl group of Thr-83, a key response regulator residue in signal transduction (28Appleby J.L. Bourret R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3563-3569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is hydrogen bonded to the amide side chain of Gln-55 (Fig. 2). Finally, the side chain of Tyr-102, another key residue in signal transduction (29Ganguli S. Wang H. Matsumura P. Volz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17386-17393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Zhu X. Amsler C.D. Volz K. Matsumura P. J.

A, stereoview of the active site. The atoms are color-coded, and water molecules are represented as red spheres. B, stereoview of the interface between α4 and the protein core.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Very few interactions secure helix α4 (residues 88–96) to the core of the protein. They arise from van der Waals contacts between the side chain of Ile-94 and the side chains of Ala-81 (3.8 Å) and Thr-83 (3.8 Å) from strand β4, and of Cys-99 (3.3 Å) from the α4-β5 loop (Fig. 2). Residues from the α4 helix have otherwise high accessibilities to solvent (Fig. 1). At all pH values other than 6.0, i.e. pH 7.0, 8.0, and 8.5, there was no electron density for the β4-α4 loop (residues 84–87) and for the N-terminal part of helix α4 (residues 88–96). In the active site area, Asp-10 was partially reoriented toward the active site, and only Wat3 was always observed. All other residues in the acidic pocket displayed identical atomic positions but the Tyr-102 and Lys-105 side chains were not visible. The loss of the salt-bridge interaction between Lys-105 and Asp-53 had no influence on the positions of the residues in the acidic pocket, suggesting that this geometry was independent of Lys-105. Excluding the flexible, non-modeled regions (residues 84–90 at pH 7.0, 84–93 at pH 8.0, and 84–89 at pH 8.5), the r.m.s. deviation between the Cα atoms in all metal-free DivK structures ranged from 0.45 to 0.55 Å. High r.m.s. deviations were found in the C-terminal half of the protein and were correlated with higher temperature factors (Fig. 3). The flexibility of the C-terminal moiety of the protein from the β4-α4 loop suggested by these crystal structures was confirmed by the biochemical properties described later in this report. At pH 6.0 and 7.0, there was no evidence for Mg2+ binding in the active site in crystals obtained by cocrystallization with this ion or in crystals soaked with 20 mm Mg2+ (data not shown). Binding of Mg2+ occurred at pH 8.0 and 8.5 with occupancies increasing from 0.3 to 0.8 (Table II). In contrast, using 20 mmMn2+, metal binding occurred at all examined pH values with occupancies increasing with pH (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9 at pH 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 8.5, respectively, Table II). At much lower ion concentration (1 mm) and at pH 8.0, Mn2+ binds to the DivK protein with about the same occupancy. These observations were in good agreement with the pH dependence of the dissociation constants for these ions measured by fluorescence experiments (see next paragraph). The metal ion corresponded to the highest positive peak in difference Fourier maps (Fig. 4). It induced no conformational change in the acidic pocket except for the side chain of Asp-10, which rotated in the inward position, and for the side chain of Asp-53, which flipped by about 80°. The χ1 and χ2 values for Asp-53 in the metal-free and metal-bound structures were (−165°, −55°) and (165°, 25°), respectively, very similar to the corresponding values in the metal-free and metal-bound CheY structures (11Stock A.M. Mottonen J.M. Stock J.B. Schutt C.E. Nature. 1989; 337: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 32Stock A.M. Martinez-Hackert E. Rasmussen B.F. West A.H. Stock J.B. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13375-13380Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The metal ion binding is not canonical in that it displays a distorted octahedral coordination that is not observed in the active sites of other response regulators and is not suitable for catalysis (Fig. 5). The ligands of the Mn2+ or Mg2+ ions were the oxygen atoms from the carboxylate groups of Glu-9, Asp-10, and Asp-53, and two water molecules. One of the water molecules was hydrogen bonded to the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Gln-55. The coordination of the metal to the third acidic residue (Glu-9) and the absence of direct coordination to the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Gln-55 differs from what has been reported for all metal-bound receiver domains (32Stock A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2331743588,"The transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCNER) pathway maintains genomic stability by rapidly eliminating helix-distorting DNA adducts, such as UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), specifically from the transcribed strands of active genes. DNA mismatch repair (MMR) constitutes yet another critical antimutagenic pathway that removes mispaired bases generated during semiconservative replication. It was previously reported that the human colon adenocarcinoma strains HCT116 and LoVo (bearing homozygous mutations in the MMR genes hMLH1 and hMSH2, respectively), besides manifesting hallmark phenotypes associated with defective DNA mismatch correction, are also completely deficient in TCNER of UV-induced CPDs. This revealed a direct mechanistic link between MMR and TCNER in human cells, although subsequent studies have either supported, or argued against, the validity of this important notion. Here, the ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction was used to show at nucleotide resolution that MMR-deficient HCT116 and LoVo retain the ability to excise UV-induced CPDs much more rapidly from the transcribed vs the nontranscribed strands of active genes. Moreover, relative to DNA repair-proficient counterparts, MMR-deficient cells were not more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of UV, and displayed equal ability to recover mRNA synthesis following UV challenge. These results conclusively demonstrate that hMLH1- and hMSH2-deficient human colon adenocarcinoma cells are fully proficient in TCNER."
https://openalex.org/W2314116484,"We have investigated the interaction between the expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1), a stoichiometric inhibitor of Cdk, and the transcriptional activity of the oestrogen receptor alpha (ER(alpha). Transient transfection experiments demonstrated that the expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) amplified the transcriptional activation by ER(alpha). A dominant negative mutant of Cdk2 also enhanced the ER(alpha) transcriptional activity, indicating that the underlying mechanism relies on the inhibition of Cdk2 activity and cell cycle arrest. In agreement with this conclusion, experiments with p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) mutants demonstrated that the domain involved in the binding of p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) to Cdks was indispensable for the modulation of ER(alpha) activity. In addition, we show that expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) alleviates the block on CBP function mediated by Cdk2 and in turn stimulates transcriptional activation by ER(alpha) in a CBP-histone acetyltransferase (HAT)-dependent manner. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) functions as an enhancer of ER(alpha) activity through the modulation of CBP function."

Increased aggregation of βL-crystallin was also observed despite the presence of α-crystallin (which has anti-aggregating properties) in the system. Self-aggregation of the oxidized βL-crystallin fragments per se was not observed under the experimental conditions. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis of the precipitate obtained after heating a mixture of βL-crystallin and oxidized βL-crystallin fragments revealed that more than one peptide co-precipitates with βL-crystallin. Electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of the peptides revealed that the molecular weight(s) of the peptides ranged from 1400–1800.

Oxidized synthetic peptides representing the same sequence were also found to enhance the aggregation of βL-crystallin in a manner similar to oxidized lens βL-crystallin peptides.

Elevated H2O2 levels have been measured in ocular tissues during senile cataract (4Spector A. Garner W.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 33: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Damage to lens crystallins appears to be largely attributable to the effects of UV radiation and/or various active oxygen species such as oxygen radicals, ·O2, and H2O2 (3Augesteyn R.C. Duncan G. Mechanisms of Cataract Formation in the Human Lens. Academic Press, New York1981: 71-116Google Scholar). Previous studies on the relationships among oxidation, cataract formation, and proteolysis in cultured rat lens suggest that calpain may be activated in H2O2-treated lens (5Kadoya K. Azuma M. David L.L. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 12: 341-346Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that calpain II increased the insolubilization of β-crystallin polypeptides (6David L.L. Wright J.W. Shearer T.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1139: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that accumulation of crystallin fragments in vivo may lead to increased scattering and cataractogenesis. Proteolysis is associated with cataract and aging, and increased amounts of crystallin fragments are present in cataract lenses (7David L.L. Shearer T.R. Lens Eye Toxic. Res. 1989; 6: 725-747PubMed Google Scholar, 8Shearer T.R. David L.L. Anderson R.S. Azuma M. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Mitton K.P. Kamiya T.

Eye Res. 1982; 34: 909-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have confirmed that proteolysis occurs during cataract formation in rats and mice, respectively. Barber (12Barber G.W. Exp. Eye Res. 1973; 16: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reported that in human lens the quantity of degraded proteins increased with the severity of the cataract. Srivastava et al. (13Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Silney C. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have reported that the amount of degraded crystallins in aged/cataract lenses from human eye can be as much as 20–25% of the total protein. As many as 13 polypeptide species with molecular masses between 3 and 17 kDa, originating from α, β, and γ-crystallins, have been isolated and characterized from human lenses (13Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Silney C. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein aggregation, which increases with age, results in the accumulation of high molecular weight aggregates that directly scatter light. While it has been hypothesized that improper interaction of crystallin fragments generated by proteolysis may be responsible for the development of cataract (7David L.L. Shearer T.R. Lens Eye Toxic. Res. 1989; 6: 725-747PubMed Google Scholar), how the crystallin fragments initiate or influence the process of lens protein aggregation to form high molecular weight aggregates is poorly understood. To simulate aging and proteolysis we oxidized bovine βL-crystallins with H2O2 in the presence of CuSO4 (14Kato Y. Uchida K. Kawakishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then treated them with trypsin to generate peptide fragments. The resulting βL-crystallin fragments were tested for their ability to influence the aggregation of thermally denaturing βL-crystallin. We also investigated whether the aggregation kinetics of denaturing proteins are altered in the absence or presence of oxidized peptides and α-crystallin. This investigation shows that the peptides derived from oxidized βL-crystallin can enhance the aggregation of denaturing proteins. We also report the origin, molecular weights, and sequence of the polypeptides that bind to the aggregating βL-crystallin. Sequence-grade trypsin was purchased from Cooper Biomedicals. Yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)1 was procured from Sigma Chemical Company. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. α-Crystallin was isolated from young bovine lens cortex by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-200 and ion-exchange chromatography on a TMAE Fractogel column (EM Separations) as described earlier (15Das K.P. Petrash J.M Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10449-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The βL-crystallin was isolated from bovine lens extracts following Sephadex G-200 chromatography as described earlier (16Sharma K.K. Ortwerth B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The βL-crystallins isolated from bovine lens (30 mg) were oxidized with 10 mmH2O2 in the presence of 0.1 mmCuSO4 (14Kato Y. Uchida K. Kawakishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23646-23651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in a final volume of 30 ml. The mixture was incubated for 12 h at 25 °C. The extent of protein oxidation was monitored by amino acid analysis and tryptophan fluorescence measurement. The oxidized solution was extensively dialyzed (M rcut-off 10,000 Da) against 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 12 h. The dialyzed protein samples were treated with trypsin (50:1 w/w) for 12 h at 37 °C to generate peptides. Following this, 1 mm N-tosyl lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) was added to inactivate the trypsin, and the solution was filtered through a 10-kDa centrifugal filter (Amicon). The low molecular weight peptides were recovered and designated as the oxidized and proteolyzed fraction. As a control, native βL-crystallin was digested with trypsin without oxidation as mentioned above. The capacity of α-crystallin to suppress heat-induced aggregation of βL-crystallin or ADH was determined according to the method described earlier (16Sharma K.K. Ortwerth B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, a known amount of substrate protein βL-crystallin (100 μg) or ADH (200 μg) was heat denatured in 50 mm PO4 buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl in 1 ml. The assay was also performed in the presence or absence of α-crystallin (15 μg) and different concentrations (100–200 μg) of oxidized βL-crystallin fragments. The aggregation of the protein was followed by recording the increase in absorbance at 360 nm as a function of time, using a Shimadzu spectrophotometer equipped with a multicell transporter attached to a Peltier temperature regulator. In order to isolate the peptides bound to the aggregated βL-crystallin, an aliquot of the oxidized βL-crystallin peptides (400 μg) was added to the native βL-crystallin (200 μg) in a final volume of 1 ml of 0.05 m phosphate buffer containing 0.1m NaCl. The solution was incubated at 55 °C for 1 h. Following incubation, the solution was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 15 min to recover the precipitate. The supernatant was also preserved and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. Subsequently, the precipitate was washed with deionized water and centrifuged. This procedure was repeated twice to ensure that the precipitate was free of soluble peptides and proteins. The washed precipitate was dissolved in 200 μl of freshly prepared 6 m urea solution, vortexed, and kept overnight at room temperature for 16 h to dissociate bound peptides from the aggregated proteins. To separate the peptides from βL-crystallin, the sample dissolved in urea (200 μl) was diluted with 200 μl of HPLC buffer A (water/acetonitrile (95:5) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and subjected to reverse phase analysis on a C18 column 218TP54 (The Separations Group, Hesparia, CA). The peptides were eluted using a 0–40% acetonitrile gradient for 60 min followed by a 40–90% gradient for another 20 min. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/minute. The absorbance was monitored at 220 nm, and the fractions were collected. The peptides eluted during HPLC were pooled into two separate fractions (Fractions A and B) and concentrated. Samples of native βL-crystallin and oxidized βL-crystallin after tryptic digestion were also analyzed separately. The molecular weight of the peptides isolated by HPLC was determined using a triple-quadrupole electrospray ionization mass spectrometer TSQ 7000 (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Mass accuracy of this unit is better than 0.01%. The samples obtained from the above step were introduced into the mass spectrometer by direct infusion at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The peptide identity was determined after tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) analysis. The sequences of the peptides were determined by tandem MS/MS, performed in the above mentioned mass spectrometer. The parent ion was selectively isolated and fragmented to give a series of fragment ions, due to backbone cleavage of the peptide. Automated analysis of CID spectra to determine the amino acid sequence of peptides was performed on computer as described (17Yates III, J.R. Carmack E. Hayes L. Link A.J. Eng J.K. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 553-569PubMed Google Scholar) using SEQUEST software from ThermoFinnigan. The protein measurements were made at 280 nm or by the Bicinchoninic acid method (18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). The amino acid composition of the native and oxidized βL-crystallin was determined by amino acid analysis at the Experimental Station Chemical Laboratories of the University of Missouri according to the method described by Gehrke et al. (19Gehrke C.W. Rexroad P.R. Schisla R.M. Absheer J.S. Zumwalt R.W. J. Assoc. of Anal. Chem. 1987; 70: 171-174PubMed Google Scholar). The fluorescence measurements were made in a Jasco spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence spectra of the native and oxidized βL-crystallin (0.1 mg/ml) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were taken using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and an emission scan between 300–400 nm. Synthetic peptides LTIFEQENFLGR (P-1), AINGTWVGYEFPGYR (P-2), and DRRIFWWSLRSAPGA (P-3) were prepared in the Department of Chemistry, University of Missouri. These peptides were oxidized with CuSO4 and H2O2 as described above for 6 h, and their aggregation-promoting effect on denaturing βL-crystallin was studied essentially as mentioned earlier. Control peptides without oxidation were also processed simultaneously. The extent of tryptophan modification in the oxidized synthetic peptides (P-2 and P-3) was quantified by spectrometric method (20Spies J.R. Chambers D.C. Anal. Chem. 1948; 20: 20-39Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Peptide (P-1) oxidation was confirmed by amino acid analysis. Exposure of Proteins to H2O2 and Cu2+ results in extensive oxidation. To analyze the extent of H2O2 and CuSO4 induced oxidation of βL-crystallin, we monitored the change in the fluorescence characteristics of the protein as the tryptophan residues were damaged during the oxidation process. Native βL-crystallin shows a fluorescence emission peak at 338 nm when excited at 295 nm. Under the oxidation conditions we employed there was a decrease (60%) in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the oxidized βL-crystallin protein compared with the native protein, indicating a significant oxidation of tryptophan residue(s). Furthermore, amino acid analysis indicated a decrease in the levels of several amino acids in oxidized protein relative to that of the native βL-crystallin (TableI). SDS-PAGE (Fig.1) analysis under reducing conditions revealed the formation of both high and low molecular weight components. These changes can be attributed to the free radicals generated by the H2O2 and Cu2+mixture, known to cause protein oxidation, degradation as well as cross-linking.Table IAmino acid analysis of the native βL-crystallin and oxidized βL-crystallinAmino acidβL-crystallinNativeOxidized% decreaseThr10031Met10095Tyr10010His10025Only the amino acids affected by oxidation are listed.

Open table in a new tab Only the amino acids affected by oxidation are listed. Other amino acids did not show any significant change. Increase in MetSO and cysteine sulfinic acid was observed in the oxidized sample. The data shown are the average of two samples analyzed. Thermal denaturation of βL-crystallin resulted in aggregation and light scattering. Addition of the oxidized βL-crystallin fragments (50 μg) increased scattering of denaturing βL-crystallin compared with one without βL-crystallin fragments as measured by the increase in absorbance (Fig. 2 a). This effect was dependent on the concentration of the oxidized crystallin fragments. For instance, increasing the concentration of the oxidized βL-crystallin fragments from 50 to 100 μg resulted in further increased absorbance due to more scattering elements (Fig.2 a). However, the increased scattering elements were not due to the aggregation of βL-peptides since the peptides by themselves did not scatter light under the experimental conditions (data not shown). Further, oxidation was also required for the increased scattering, since non-oxidized βl-crystallin fragments had no effect on protein aggregation. Increased light scattering in presence of oxidized peptides was accompanied by precipitation of greater quantity of protein. This was confirmed by measuring the amount of the proteins precipitated with and without oxidized peptides. Therefore, increased light scattering was likely due to an increased proportion of aggregated protein rather than a simple increase in aggregate size. After demonstrating the ability of oxidized βL-crystallin fragments to enhance the relative scattering of denaturing βL-crystallin, we investigated whether the presence of oxidized peptides facilitate aggregation even in the presence of α-crystallin. Fig. 2 b shows the aggregation kinetics of βL-crystallin in the presence of α-crystallin (15 μg) and/or oxidized βL-crystallin fragments. The concentration of α-crystallin (15 μg) used in these assays was such that it allowed us to observe the modulating effect of the oxidized βL-crystallin peptides. As expected, α-crystallin was able to suppress the aggregation of denaturing βL-crystallin (this is due to the chaperone-like activity of α-crystallin). Addition of oxidized βL-crystallin fragments (50 μg) facilitated light scattering by denaturing βL-crystallin in the presence of α-crystallin as well. Furthermore, increasing the βL-crystallin peptide fragments concentration in the system from 50 to 100 μg appeared to further increase the scattering and precipitation of the substrate protein. However, the peptide fragments derived from non-oxidized βL-crystallin did not have any influence on thermally denaturing βL-crystallin in the presence of α-crystallin (Fig. 2 b). Similar results were obtained when ADH was used as a denaturing substrate protein (data not shown). A representative HPLC chromatogram depicting the elution profile of the precipitate obtained after heat treatment of a mixture of native βL-crystallin and oxidized βL-crystallin peptides is shown in (Fig.3). Four peaks were observed eluting between 47 and 57 min, followed by βL-crystallin. Analysis of the βL-crystallin precipitate obtained after heat treatment under similar conditions showed only βL-crystallin profile (data not shown). These results suggest that some of the oxidized βL-crystallin derived peptides bind to the aggregating βL-crystallin. The peptides eluting between 47 and 57 min during HPLC (Fig. 3) were pooled and designated as fractions A (peak nos: 1 + 2) and B (peak nos: 3 + 4). The pooled peptide fractions (A and B) were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The spectra of peptide fraction A is depicted in Fig. 4 a. There were peaks at mass charge (m/z) 1730.1 for the singly charged form (MH+) and at m/z865.1 for the doubly charged form (MH2+) of a single peptide. The 881.2 m/z ion is 32-dalton higher than the doubly charged parent ion, at 865.1 m/z. The addition of two oxygen atoms to one of the amino acids in a peptide would result in a 32-Da mass shift. When we determined the sequence of singly charged 1730.1 m/z ion by MS/MS analysis it was found to match the sequence of residues 153–167 (AINGTWVGYEFPGYR) in bovine βB3-crystallin. The oxidation of Trp toN-formylkynurenine in AINGTWVGYEFPGYR peptide (P-2) could result in a doubly charged 881.2 ion found during the initial analysis (Fig. 4 a). This was confirmed by MS/MS analysis of the peptide with m/z 881.2 ion from Fig.4 a, and the data are shown in Fig. 4 b. During MS/MS analysis, several of the b and y ions produced showed 32 dalton mass shifts compared with the unoxidized peptide spectra (not shown). Since the masses of b3, y3, and y5 ions do not reflect any oxidation, we feel that the 32-dalton mass shift in b6 and y11 ions were likely due to the oxidation of the most susceptible amino acid in the peptide, Trp. The 881.2 m/z ion has the sequence AINGTWoxVGYEFPGYR (P-2), which matched with residues 153–167 of bovine βB3-crystallin. The other ion peaks betweenm/z 1000–1500 in Fig. 4 a could be contributed by more than one oxidized βL-crystallin fragment present in the sample. These ions were not analyzed to determine their identity. Analysis of fraction B showed peaks at m/z 1466.4 (MH+) and m/z 734.0 (MH2+) (Fig. 5 a). The peak at m/z 749.5 is 32 Da higher than the doubly charged parent ion, which indicates the addition of two oxygen atom (32 Da) to the peptide. In the same fraction, other peaks atm/z 1774.5 (MH+) andm/z 888.1 (MH2+) were also observed during MS analysis (data not shown). The doubly charged parent ions in all cases were additionally analyzed by MS/MS to confirm the sequence of the peptides. An example of an MS/MS of a peptide withm/z 734.0 (MH+ 1466.4) is shown in Fig. 5 b. The spectrum shows the fragments formed by collisional activation of the peptide, which has the sequence LTIFEQENFLGR (P-1). Sequence matching of this peptide was performed to determine the identity of the parent crystallin. The P-1 peptide sequence was similar to the amino acid residues 123–132 of the bovine βA4-crystallin. In this case the 749.1 ion was not further analyzed. MS/MS analysis of another peptide with m/z 888.1 showed a sequence ENIQINADNQIYVLK. We were unable to confirm the identity of the parent protein for this peptide as it did not match any of the known βL-crystallin protein sequences. Peptides (1 and 2) corresponding to the sequences of P-1 and P-2 were synthesized and tested to confirm their role in facilitating aggregation of denaturing proteins. These peptides were oxidized by H2O2 and Cu2+. Amino acid analysis of peptide P-1 indicated a decrease in the following amino acids. The percent decrease was (Phe, −37%, Arg, −40%, Thr, −36%), respectively, compared with the unoxidized peptide. Spectrometric assay suggested that the amino acid tryptophan in the peptide-2 (P-2) was oxidized (60–80%). Enhanced aggregation of denaturing βL-crystallin was observed in the presence of oxidized P-2 (Fig. 6 a). When 25 μg of oxidized peptide was used, the enhanced aggregation was nil or only marginally higher with respect to the control βL-crystallin without peptide. However, further addition of the peptide (100 μg) showed a significant increase (70–80%) in the aggregation of βL-crystallin as evidenced by the increased light scattering. It should be noted that, with 100 μg of peptide in the system (Fig. 6 a), maximum aggregation and precipitation occurred at the midpoint of the assay duration (20 min), after which the aggregates started settling down as precipitate. Interestingly, when unoxidized peptide-2 (P-2) was added, no increase in aggregation of the βL-crystallin was observed (Fig.6 b). Additionally, the peptides by themselves did not precipitate under the experimental conditions. These results suggest that oxidation plays a key role in the aggregation-promoting effect of this peptide. Addition of the unoxidized peptide P-2 (100 μg) to a α-crystallin chaperoning system did not show any effect (Fig. 6 b). However, when the oxidized P-2 peptide was included in the assay an increased aggregation was found (Fig. 6 b). A similar observation was made with oxidized peptide P-1 but the enhancement in aggregation was less compared with that seen with peptide-2 (data not shown). Also, when these two peptides (P-1 and P-2) were added together after oxidation to an assay, the increase in light scattering of denaturing βL-crystallin was greater than after separate additions. While addition of 50 μg of either of the peptides to the assay showed less than a 10% increase in the absorbance by light scattering particles, the assays with 50 μg of each peptide added together resulted in a 30% increase in absorbance. When the facilitated aggregation was tested in the presence of a control non-lenticular peptide P-3, (DRRIFWWSLRSAPGA; 100 μg), the facilitated aggregation of the denatured protein was <10% higher compared with the aggregation of βL-crystallin by itself (Fig. 7). However, in the presence of peptide P-2 the facilitated aggregation of βL-crystallin was 90% higher (the percent increase in absorbance was due to more light scattering particles) compared with P-3. This indicates that the facilitated aggregation is significantly higher in the presence of lenticular peptide P-2, compared with a non-lenticular peptide. β-Crystallin is the most heterogenous of the lens crystallins. Earlier workers have shown that βA3/A1 crystallin is cleaved in vivo in human lenses and contributes to the formation of 4- and 5-kDa polypeptides (22Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Silney C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 207-214PubMed Google Scholar). One of the contributing factors for the generation of low molecular weight peptides from partially denatured or oxidatively modified crystallins in vivo is proteolysis (23Yoshida H. Murachi T. Tsakahara I. Invest. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1985; 26: 653-656Google Scholar, 24Sharma K.K. Kester K. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25David L.L. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1986; 42: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Srivastava O.P. Ortwerth B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1983; 37: 597-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Ray K. Harris H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7545-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Fleshman K.R. Wagner B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1984; 39: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The rate of oxidized protein degradation is also dependent on the concentration of proteases that preferentially degrade oxidized proteins (29Shang F. Huang L.L. Taylor A. Curr. Eye Res. 1994; 13: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Shang et al. (29Shang F. Huang L.L. Taylor A. Curr. Eye Res. 1994; 13: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported that bovine lens epithelial cell extracts contain proteases which selectively degrade oxidized crystallin. Earlier studies indicated that proteins oxidized by hydrogen peroxide are susceptible to hydrolysis by acylpeptide hydrolase (30Fujino T. Watanabe K. Beppu M. Kikigawa K. Yasuda H. Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 2000; 1478: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Acylpeptide hydrolase activity has also been found in lens tissue (31Sharma K.K. Ortwerth B.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that, in vivo, the oxidatively modified lens proteins are selectively degraded by specific enzyme systems, resulting in the generation of low molecular weight polypeptides. Additionally, non-enzymatic mechanisms are also likely to generate crystallin fragments (32Buckingham R. Pirie A. Exp. Eye Res. 1972; 14: 297-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33Dilley K.J. Pirie A. Exp. Eye Res. 1974; 19: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Further degradation of the peptides to release amino acids depends upon the aminopeptidase activity (34Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1353-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Taylor A. Trends in Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 167-172PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sharma K.K. Ortwerth B.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1986; 5: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in vivo. Since the peptidase activity is lower in the inner cortex and nucleus compared with the outer cortical region of the lens (24Sharma K.K. Kester K. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), a decrease in peptidase activity may be contributing to an increased accumulation of the degraded polypeptides in aging lens (36Sharma K.K. Ortwerth B.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1986; 5: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 37Srivastava O.P. Exp. Eye. Res. 1988; 47: 525-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Previous reports indicated that in vivo proteolysis of lens crystallins might lead to opacification in the human lens (38David L.L. Shearer T.R. Invest. Opthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1984; 25: 1275-1283PubMed Google Scholar, 39Takemoto L. Hansen J.S. Horwitz J. Curr. Eye Res. 1982; 2: 12849-12854Google Scholar).In vitro incubation of relatively high concentrations of rat lens water-soluble proteins (50 mg/ml) with calpain results in proteolysis of βL-crystallin and turbidity (8Shearer T.R. David L.L. Anderson R.S. Azuma M. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that proteolysis may lead to lens opacification. However, in our experiments, addition of low concentrations of βL-crystallin fragments (100–200 μg/ml) derived from proteolysis of non-oxidized proteins did not result in increased aggregation of denaturing protein or modulation of the anti-aggregation property of α-crystallin (Fig. 2, a andb). Surprisingly, the presence of the same concentrations of oxidized βL-crystallin fragments in assays led to increased aggregation, light scattering, and precipitation of denaturing proteins. Therefore, oxidation of the protein prior to proteolysis is likely to be a critical event in the peptide induced process. Our studies with oxidized synthetic peptides (Fig.6 a) further confirm a plausible role for oxidation and proteolysis in lens protein aggregation and cataractogenesis. The light scattering process is the primary factor responsible for the observed opacity in a cataractous lens. The temporal process of aggregation of crystallins and other enzymes is characterized by an initial period of low light scattering before a steep increase in scattering that slows as the aggregation process is saturated (40Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 41Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 13601-13608Google Scholar). Facilitated aggregation of denaturing βL-crystallin in the presence of increasing concentrations of oxidized βL-crystallin fragments suggests that oxidized βL-crystallin fragments function like anti-chaperones. (The term anti-chaperone is used only with reference to the aggregation-promoting property of the peptides as opposed to the aggregation-suppressing effect of α-crystallin or mini α-crystallin, Ref. 42Bhattacharyya J. Sharma K.K. J. Pept. Res. 2001; 5: 428-434Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar.) A possible mechanism for this process is that the denaturing proteins self-aggregate, and the βL-crystallin fragments associate with those aggregation-prone proteins, offering additional binding sites to the denaturing proteins and ultimately resulting in precipitation. The aggregation of lens protein into randomly distributed high molecular weight clusters is thought to produce sufficient fluctuation in protein density to account for the opacification (43Benedek G.B. Appl. Optics. 1971; 10: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 44Siew E.L. Opalecky D. Bettelheim F.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 33: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our results lend additional support to the concept that the oxidation and proteolysis may lead to cataract formation (7David L.L. Shearer T.R. Lens Eye Toxic. Res. 1989; 6: 725-747PubMed Google Scholar, 8Shearer T.R. David L.L. Anderson R.S. Azuma M. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Mitton K.P. Kamiya T.

Eye Res. 1973; 16: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, further studies are required to understand the molecular basis of the interactions between peptides and protein. The presence of low molecular mass polypeptides (4–8 kDa) in human brunescent cataracts was demonstrated by Horwitz et al.(45Horwitz J. Hansen J.S. Cheung C.C. Ding L.L. Straatsma B.R. Lightfoot D.O. Takemoto L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Several degraded crystallins have also been found to be associated with the high molecular weight proteins (46Roy D. Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 1978; 26: 445-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 47Garner W.H. Spector A. Doc. Opthalmol. Proc. Ser. 1979; 18: 91-99Google Scholar). The high molecular weight protein-associated polypeptides were found to be a heterogenous mixture derived from α-, β- and γ-crystallins (13Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Silney C. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The accumulation of crystallin fragments in vivo is likely to be one of the cause for lens opacity, as shown by Horwitz at al (45Horwitz J. Hansen J.S. Cheung C.C. Ding L.L. Straatsma B.R. Lightfoot D.O. Takemoto L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By microdissection and analysis of the opaque and clear regions of the same lenses Horwitz et al. (45Horwitz J. Hansen J.S. Cheung C.C. Ding L.L. Straatsma B.R. Lightfoot D.O. Takemoto L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have shown that low molecular weight crystallin fragments are present in the opaque region but the clear regions of the same lenses do not contain crystallin fragments. They also reported that brunescent lens nuclei, which are cataractous in nature and have significant quantities of oxidized protein, also contain crystallin fragments. From our experiments it is clear that the presence of oxidized βL-crystallin peptides leads to increased aggregation of the denaturing proteins. Based on our results we hypothesize that the hydrolysis of oxidized proteins by lens proteases and the accumulation of peptides during aging could significantly contribute to in vivo light scattering by way of facilitated aggregation and insolubilization of the modified or partially denatured lens proteins. The mechanism by which classical chaperones suppress protein aggregation is thought to involve binding of the chaperones to the denatured protein, which decreases the concentration of denatured substrate in solution (48Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that binding of increasing amounts of partially denatured γ-crystallin to the α-crystallin decreased the ability of the latter to protect against heat-induced denaturation and aggregation of ADH (49Takemoto L. Boyle D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Since a significant percentage of the α-crystallin isolated from the high molecular weight aggregate of aged bovine lens was found to be complexed to either β- or γ-crystallin (50Takemoto L. Boyle D. Curr. Eye Res. 1994; 13: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it is possible that irreversible binding of lens proteins to the α-crystallin particle may decrease the ability of α-crystallin to prevent further aggregation of lens proteins in vivo. In the present study, enhancing the concentration of the oxidized peptides seemed to increase aggregation of denaturing proteins despite the presence of α-crystallin (Fig. 6 b). While it is not clear whether the peptides bind to α-crystallin during the aggregation process, from our studies, it appears that oxidized βL-crystallin fragments enhance the aggregation of denaturing proteins even when α-crystallin attempts to suppress their aggregation. This effect may involve the interaction of peptide and α-crystallin at different sites on the denaturing protein. From our in vitro study it is clear that the oxidized peptides bind to the denaturing βL-crystallin. Alternately, an intermolecular competition for common binding sites in the denaturing proteins may be taking place between the oxidized βL-crystallin fragments and α-crystallin. The relative concentrations of the protein and peptides may determine the end result. Further studies on the interaction of the peptide or α-crystallin with the denaturing proteins are required to unravel the molecular mechanisms behind the interactions. It is difficult to quantitatively relate the effects of the oxidized peptides on the aggregation process in vitro to the protein aggregation and opacification in vivo without knowing the precise amount and location of the oxidized peptides in lens. However, it is of interest that improper interactions of the lens proteins and peptides generated after oxidation and subsequent proteolysis facilitated aggregation and increased light scattering. Further characterization of the chemical basis for the action of the oxidized peptides and their interaction with crystallins and other proteinsin vitro will enable us to understand the importance of the facilitated aggregation process in suppressing lens transparency.

Cdk-activating kinase hemagglutinin 5-fluoroorotic acid open reading frame hydroxyurea cyclin-dependent kinase C-terminal domain The set of proteins required for regulated transcription of eukaryotic mRNAs includes in addition to RNA polymerase II the general transcription factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH) (Refs. 1Lemon B.

Individual components have unique roles in the process of transcription. For example, TFIIH possesses DNA unwinding activity (3Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a protein kinase activity directed at the carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (3Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A new perspective on the functions of the transcriptional machinery has emerged with the discovery that TFIIH is a necessary participant in a distinct cellular process: excision repair of DNA damage (reviewed in Refs. 7Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar and 8de Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 768-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Thus, components of the transcriptional machinery may be involved in other cellular processes, allowing a possibility of coordinating such processes with transcription. TFIIH is composed of nine known subunits, all of which are conserved between yeast and animal cells. The subunits of yeast TFIIH are encoded by the genes: SSL2, RAD3, TFB1, SSL1,TFB2, TFB3, TFB4, CCL1, andKIN28 (3Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The Kin28p and Ccl1p subunits of TFIIH are, respectively, the catalytic and cyclin-like subunits of a protein kinase that phosphorylates the CTD of RNA polymerase II (3Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 9Frit P. Bergmann E. Egly J.M. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The homologs of KIN28 and CCL1 in animal cells are cdk7 and cyclin H (cycH), respectively. Interestingly, cdk7 and cycH have been independently isolated as components of a protein kinase termed CAK1 (CDK-activating kinase) (3Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 9Frit P. Bergmann E. Egly J.M. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that phosphorylates the cell cycle kinases on a threonine residue (Thr-161 of cdc2 or its equivalent) and activates them. A third subunit of CAK has been identified, termed MAT1. The MAT1 protein seems to act as an assembly factor, stimulating the activity of CAK by stabilizing the complex between the cdk7 and cycH subunits. MAT1 was subsequently found to be a component of TFIIH (3Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 9Frit P. Bergmann E. Egly J.M. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MAT1 is the ortholog of yeast Tfb3 protein, suggesting that the triad of Tfb3-Kin28-Ccl1 may have similar functions in yeast and in animal cells. Mutations in TFB3 have been reported in a screen for mutants that are synthetic-lethal with a kin28-ts mutation (10Faye G. Simon M. Valay J.G. Fesquet D. Facca C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); the gene is named RIG2. Two mutants described in that report are severely and generally defective in transcription; each mutant bears multiple amino acid substitutions spread over the coding sequence. Another recent report shows that the tfb3-2 mutant is moderately sensitive to UV radiation, and is defective in nucleotide excision repair in vitro (11Feaver W.J. Huang W. Gileadi O. Myers L. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that Tfb3p has multiple roles in transcription and DNA repair. The N terminus of TFB3 contains a cysteine-rich motif known as the RING or C3HC4 zinc motif (12Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The conserved RING motif folds into a compact domain in which two zinc ions are coordinated by the seven cysteines and one histidine (13Barlow P.N. Luisi B. Milner A. Elliott M. Everett R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 14Gervais V. Busso D. Wasielewski E. Poterszman A. Egly J.M. Thierry J.C. Kieffer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7457-7464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Proteins with diverse cellular functions possess similar RING motifs, which are suggested to be important in the architecture of large complexes and in protein ubiquitination (12Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The evidence for CAK activity of the MAT1-cdk7-cycH complexes in animal cells derives entirely from biochemical experiments that demonstrate such an activity in vitro. Experimental evidence that establishes such a role in vivo has been found in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe (15Buck V. Russell P. Millar J.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6173-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Damagnez V. Makela T.P. Cottarel G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6164-6172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This is in contrast with budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), where an exhaustive study using a mutant of KIN28 and immunodepletion of Kin28 protein from yeast extracts did not support a role for Kin28 protein in Cdc28p phosphorylation (17Cismowski M.J. Laff G.M. Solomon M.J. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutants of KIN28 and CCL1 (as well as other subunits of TFIIH) did establish a role in transcription and in the phosphorylation of the CTD. Several publications identified an unusual protein kinase, termedCAK1 or CIV1, as the major CAK in budding yeast (18Espinoza F.H. Farrell A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Morgan D.O. Science. 1996; 273: 1714-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 20Thuret J.Y. Valay J.G. Faye G. Mann C. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This identification is supported by both biochemical assays of the bacterially expressed protein, by observations in vivo, as well as from the finding of distantly related proteins inArabidopsis and fission yeast that could complement the yeast mutant (21Hermand D. Westerling T. Pihlak A. Thuret J.Y. Vallenius T. Tiainen M. Vandenhaute J. Cottarel G. Mann C. Makela T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Umeda M. Bhalerao R.P. Schell J. Uchimiya H. Koncz C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5021-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cak1p is only distantly related to Kin28p or cdk7. Cak1p/Civ1p is active as CAK as a monomer and, thus, does not require a cyclin subunit or post-translation modification by another yeast protein for its activity. It is not clear whether there is a difference between budding yeast, fission yeast, and animal cells in the identity of CAK, and whether complexes containing Kin28p/cdk7 have any role in Cdk activation in vivo. In the present study, we have conducted a mutational analysis of the yeast TFB3 gene. Lethal mutations were found in metal-coordinating residues of the RING domain. The mutant phenotype links Tfb3p to cell cycle progression. We further show that the RING domain contributes to the stability of association of the kinase moiety of TFIIH (known as TFIIK) with its core. 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) was from Diagnostic Chemicals. Radioactive nucleotides were from Amersham Biosciences or PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (purified IgG), directed at the influenza HA epitope, was a gift from J. Gerst.

Gileadi, unpublished observations. were used in immunoblots as unfractionated sera from rabbits at 1:20,000 dilution. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against Kin28p (24Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), a gift from R. Kornberg, were used at 1:3000. Monoclonal antibody against Rad1p, 3E3, was kindly supplied by A. E. Tomkinson and used at 1:1000. Selective media for yeast were synthetic drop-out media (SC) lacking the relevant nutrients -Trp, -Leu, -His. YPD and YPAD media were as described in Kaiser (26Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics, A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. 4th Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1994Google Scholar). Buffer TA(x) consists of 20% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors (27Feaver W.J. Gileadi O. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19000-19005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and potassium acetate at the molar concentration given in parentheses. Plasmids pRS313 (CEN, HIS3), pRS316 (CEN, URA3) and pRS426 (2μ, URA3) (28Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). A genomic fragment containing the wild type TFB3 gene (nucleotides 12141–16307 from GenBankTM accession U33050; the TFB3 open reading frame is YDR460W, nucleotides 14542–15507) in pBluescript was obtained from W. J. Feaver and cloned into pRS313 to produce pRS313-TFB3 and into pRS316 to generate pRS316-TFB3. Yeast strain YPH501 (29Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was from the Yeast Genetic Stock Center, Berkeley. W303-1a-(MATa,ade2-1, his3-11,15,leu2-3,trp1-1,ura3,can1-100) and W303-1b-(MATα, ade2-1,his3-11,15,leu2-3,trp1-1,ura3,can1-100) were from J. Gerst. Strain kin28-ts16 was obtained from M. Cismowski. Mutants ofTFB3 were generated and identified by a plasmid shuffling procedure (31Sikorski R. Boeke J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). A yeast strain with a chromosomal deletion ofTFB3 sequences was constructed as follows. TheLEU2 gene was inserted between the BspEI andBstEII sites within TFB3, and the linearized construct was used to transform the diploid strain YPH501 to leucine prototrophy. Heterozygotes (with gene disruptions confirmed by Southern analysis) were then transformed with pRS316-TFB3 and selected for uracil and leucine prototrophy. The cells were then sporulated, and tetrad dissection yielded segregants with a chromosomal deletion ofTFB3 sequences complemented by a plasmid-borne copy of the gene; the resulting strain is termed yOG200. To generate mutants of TFB3, plasmid pRS313-TFB3 was mutagenized in vitro with hydroxylamine (31Sikorski R. Boeke J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Pools of mutated plasmids were used to transform yOG200, either directly or after amplification in Escherichia coli. His+ colonies were replica plated on plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA) to select for loss of the wild-type TFB3 gene on pRS316-TFB3. Clones that failed to grow on FOA plates at 37 °C or at any temperature were identified, plasmid DNA was rescued, and the plasmid shuffling procedure was repeated. W-tfb3-2 strain was built by inserting the RING C16-Y mutation into the chromosomal TFB3 gene in strain W303-1a, using “two step gene replacement” (26Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics, A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. 4th Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1994Google Scholar). The TFB3 gene in strains W303-1a & W-tfb3-2 strains was then tagged with C-terminal addition of six repeats of the HA epitope, by homologous recombination with a PCR-amplified module (32Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The tagged strains are termed TFB3+ HA andtfb3-2HA, respectively. The oligonucleotides used for PCR were the following: 5′-GAAAATAAAAAGTAGTTGATTACATAGCTTATGCCACGTTGCACACTATCCTGATGATCGATGAATTCGAGCTCG-3′ and 5′-GGGTGTTGACAGAGGCATTTATGGGCTTAGGATGTGTTATATCCGAGGAGCTTCG TACGCTGCAGGTCGAC-3′. The template used for PCR (pYM3, Ref. 32Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) contains six repeats of the HA tag, followed by the TRP1selectable marker from K. lactis on a separate reading frame. Yeast cells grown at the conditions specified for each experiment were harvested by centrifugation, and RNA was prepared from 50–200 ml cultures by phenol extraction with glass beads (26Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics, A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. 4th Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1994Google Scholar). The quantity and quality of the RNA was assessed by absorbance measurements and by ethidium-stained gel electrophoresis. Formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and blot hybridization of 20 μg of each RNA sample was performed using Hybond membranes (AmershamBiosciences) or Genescreen (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For genome wide expression experiments HA-tagged TFB3+ andtfb3-2 strains were grown to early exponential phase in YPD media at 30 °C. Then, half of each culture was shifted to 37 °C for 90 min. Preparation of RNA, generation of amino-allyl labeled cDNA, labeling with Cy3 and Cy5, and hybridization was essentially done as described at The Microarray Center(www.uhnres.utoronto.ca/services/microarray/protocols/). Hybridizations were performed on yeast micro slides (CMT-GAPS-coated slides containing all yeast ORFs (Yeast 6.4K1, lot 24301000, batch code 23020323) purchased from The Microarray Center MBRC, Toronto, Canada. Slides were scanned with ScanArray 4000 (Packard BioScience) and quantified with the QuantArray software (Packard BioScience). Then the intensities of the spots were normalized by subtracting the mean of the background (negative control). In the final step, we calculated log 2(ratio) of each spot, from which we subtracted the median of log 2(ratio) of all spots on the array. Differences of over 2-fold were considered to be significant. The full data set is available upon request. Yeast cells were grown in YPD according to the scheme described in the legend to Fig. 3. Hydroxyurea was added, when indicated, as a solid to a concentration of 0.2 m; the solid rapidly dissolved in the medium. To remove the hydroxyurea, cells were centrifuged and washed three times in fresh, prewarmed medium. After the appropriate incubations, 1 ml of each culture was centrifuged and the cells were suspended in 0.3 ml of ice-cold water and fixed by addition of 0.7 ml of ice-cold ethanol. For microscopic examination, the fixed cells were washed once in water and twice in phosphate-buffered saline. For flow cytometry, the cells were treated and stained with propidium iodide as described (33Reed S.I. Wittenberg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5697-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Yeast cells,TFB3+ HA and tfb3-2 HA, were grown at 30 °C to early exponential phase. Then half of each culture was shifted and further grown at 37 °C for 90 min. The cells were harvested, and whole cell extracts were prepared as described (34Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. LaPointe J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To enrich the extracts with TFIIH subunits, proteins were precipitated by adding 1.04 volumes of saturated ammonium sulfate (4 °C, pH 7.5). Pellets were resuspended in TA(0) buffer and dialyzed overnight with two changes against TA(0.1). Extracts were then loaded on HiTrapQ Sepharose (1 ml, Amersham Biosciences) and eluted using a linear gradient of potassium acetate in TA buffer. Collected fractions were analyzed by Western blot using a set of antibodies against different subunits of TFIIH. Two of the peaks that contained subunits of TFIIH were further pooled (peaks I and II), concentrated using Centricon-30 (Amicon), and were run on a size exclusion column (Superdex 200 HR10/30; Amersham Biosciences), using TA(0.2) as running buffer. Complex compositions were determined by Western blot, and sizes were estimated by comparing to a run with gel filtration molecular weight standards (Sigma). Analysis of proteins in cells was done using a trichloroacetic acid extraction procedure, followed by Western blot analysis of aliquots containing equal amounts of total protein (25Jona G. Choder M. Gileadi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1491: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A plasmid-borne copy of TFB3was mutagenized at random using hydroxylamine, and the pool of mutagenized plasmids was introduced into yeast cells. A plasmid shuffling protocol was used to eliminate the wild-type copy of the gene, testing the ability of mutant tfb3 to support growth and viability. Three recessive mutants with a severe phenotype were isolated: one conditional mutant (temperature-sensitive,tfb3-2 or tfb3-ts), and two absolutely lethal mutants (tfb3-5 and tfb3-35). Interestingly, sequencing of the mutant genes (Fig.1 A) revealed that all three mutations were alterations of conserved cysteines of the RING motif, which are involved in zinc binding and protein-protein interaction (12Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar,13Barlow P.N. Luisi B. Milner A. Elliott M. Everett R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). An initial characterization of the tfb3-2 strain revealed that this mutant exhibits an increased sensitivity to UV radiation and is impaired in nucleotide excision repair in vitro (11Feaver W.J. Huang W. Gileadi O. Myers L. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mutant is unable to grow in the presence of caffeine, hinting to a defect in the response to DNA damage. The mutanttfb3-2 in which the second cysteine of the RING motif is mutated to tyrosine, supports growth at temperatures up to 34 °C. However, a tfb3-2 culture fails to grow or to form colonies at 37 °C or higher temperatures, even when the mutant protein is overexpressed (not shown). To test whether the mutant is defective in RNA polymerase II transcription, RNA was extracted from mutant cells at various times following a shift to a restrictive temperature. The levels of several mRNA sequences were followed by Northern blot hybridization. For comparison, wild type cells and cells harboring a temperature-sensitive mutation in KIN28, another TFIIH subunit, were similarly analyzed. Fig. 2 shows the results of a representative experiment. The transcripts of SSM1/2,HIS3, ADH1, and CLB2 decay rapidly upon shift of the transcriptionally defective kin28-ts16mutant cells to the restrictive temperature. In contrast, shift of thetfb3-2 mutant to 37 °C did not affect mRNA levels of most genes tested. The only exception we found was the CLB2gene, encoding a G2 cyclin; results obtained with this gene were variable, with transcript levels declining by 30–80% relative to those seen at the permissive temperature. To extend our results to the genome at large, we analyzed the samples on DNA arrays and got similar results in which general transcription is almost not affected intfb3-2 mutant, since over 96% of the genes are similarly transcribed (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, the major groups of genes that are affected by the mutation belong to metabolic enzymes and ribosomal genes, which suggest that the observed change may be the consequence of the reduced growth rate and the accompanying physiological changes. Finally, we have performed an exhaustive screen for possible multicopy suppressors of the tfb3-2 mutation, but failed to pick any gene except for 13 clones of the TFB3gene (not shown). Thus, although the lethality of the tfb3-2mutation may be due to impaired transcription of a subset of essential genes, the defect is unlikely to be due to deficiency in a single gene. Microscopic examination of the mutant cells revealed that the cells held at the restrictive temperature were much larger than their wild-type counterparts (compare Fig. 3,A and B). The cell morphology was not uniform, indicating that the cells were not arrested at a unique point in the cell cycle. However, the abnormal size suggested to us some defect in cell cycle progression that may manifest itself at more than one point in the cycle. To uncover such defects we have used an experimental protocol used previously (33Reed S.I. Wittenberg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5697-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) to reveal the G2/M role of yeast Cdc28p (see scheme in Fig. 3 E). Wild-type or mutant cells grown at 26 °C (a permissive temperature) were accumulated in S phase by hydroxyurea (HU), an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. Aliquots of the cells were then transferred to 37 °C for 1.5 h to inactivate the mutant Tfb3 protein. Finally, the cells were washed to remove hydroxyurea, and incubation was continued for an additional 6 h at 37 °C (Fig. 3, C and D). Control cultures were subjected to the same treatment but either omitting the hydroxyurea (Fig. 3, A and B) or maintaining the temperature at 26 °C (not shown). Wild type cells subjected to this treatment resumed replication after removal of the HU, leading to growing, asynchronous cultures after 6 h (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, the tfb3-2mutant cells kept at the restrictive temperature accumulated predominantly as enlarged budded cells (Fig. 3 D). Flow cytometry (Fig. 4) confirmed that the wild-type cells were distributed along the cell cycle 6 h after release from the HU block (panel F), whereas in the mutant cells most of the population accumulated at postreplicative DNA content (panel K). To investigate the biochemical basis of the mutant phenotype we first analyzed the level of the wild-type and mutant Tfb3 proteins. To this end, we have introduced the tfb3-2 mutation into the chromosomalTFB3 gene in strain W303-1a (see “Experimental Procedures”). Then, we tagged the TFB3 gene in both the wild type and the mutant strains, on their 3′-end, with a 6×HA repeat tag, using the pYM vector system (32Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Thus, Tfb3p and associated proteins could be identified using an αHA antibody. The strains bearing the tagged TFB3 (wild type or mutant) gene were indistinguishable from the corresponding untagged strains by growth rate, temperature sensitivity, UV sensitivity, and cell cycle distribution; in particular, the tagged tfb3-2 mutant strain had cell cycle defects similar to the untagged strain at the restrictive temperature. We then prepared trichloroacetic acid protein extracts from early exponential phase cultures, and tested them by Western blot analysis. The level of Tfb3p is severely reduced in the mutant already at the permissive temperature (Fig. 5). When we incubate the mutant at the restrictive temperature, a further reduction in the Tfb3 protein level is observed as seen in Fig. 5. Although other explanations cannot be ruled out, it is likely that the reduction in the Tfb3p level is a result of the reduced stability of the mutant protein. The procedures used to get highly purified TFIIH complex and subcomplexes include lengthy fractionation processes, yielding poor quantities, with high chances of causing alterations in the complexes (27Feaver W.J. Gileadi O. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19000-19005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. LaPointe J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We sought, therefore, to develop a fast biochemical method, suitable both for small- and large-scale studies, for the resolution of different forms of TFIIH from yeast. This method is based on the preparation of a whole cell extract, followed by salt fractionation (ammonium sulfate), and separation on anion exchange column. The different peak fractions from the anion exchange can then be further characterized on size exclusion columns or by immunoprecipitation. To further facilitate the biochemical examination process of the complexes, we have used the 6×HA-Tfb3p-tagged strains described in the previous section. Extracts of the wild type and mutated strains, grown at permissive and restrictive temperatures, were loaded on HiTrap Q Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) and eluted using a linear gradient of potassium acetate. The resulting fractions were run on SDS-PAGE, blotted, and tested for the different protein complexes as shown in Fig.6. We examined the distribution of Tfb1p, a core subunit of TFIIH; Ssl2p, a subunit of holo-TFIIH that is less stably associated with the core; epitope-tagged Tfb3p; Kin28p, the kinase subunit of TFIIH; and Rad1p, a protein involved in DNA repair that may be associated with TFIIH in repair complexes.
