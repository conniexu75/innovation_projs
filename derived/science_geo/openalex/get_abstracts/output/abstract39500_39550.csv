https://openalex.org/W1546619202,"Human neutrophils contain a neutral metalloproteinase which degrades denatured collagens and potentiates the action of interstitial collagenase. This gelatinase is rapidly secreted from neutrophils stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate. The secreted enzyme has been purified by a combination of chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and gelatin-Sepharose. The purified enzyme was latent and had a specific activity of 24,000 units. Estimated molecular weight obtained by gel filtration was 150,000-180,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme showed three bands with relative molecular weights of 225,000, 130,000, and 92,000. Electrophoresis in the presence of a reducing agent revealed a single band of Mr = 92,000. All the proteins seen on the unreduced gel were found to contain proteolytic activity against gelatin and native type V collagen. Polyclonal antibodies were prepared against the Mr = 130,000 and 92,000 proteins. When analyzed by immunoblotting, both antibodies recognized all three proteins. Furthermore, the identical three proteins were identified by the antibodies when crude culture medium was immunoblotted. The purified enzyme was inhibited by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline but not by serine or thiol proteinase inhibitors, suggesting that the enzyme is a metalloendoproteinase. The enzyme had little or no activity against common protein substrates such as bovine serum albumin or casein. Native type I collagen was not cleaved under conditions where native type V collagen was extensively degraded."
https://openalex.org/W1599899083,"Ferritin was found to promote the peroxidation of phospholipid liposomes, as evidenced by malondialdehyde formation, when incubated with xanthine oxidase, xanthine, and ADP. Activity was inhibited by superoxide dismutase but markedly stimulated by the addition of catalase. Xanthine oxidase-dependent iron release from ferritin, measured spectrophotometrically using the ferrous iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl, was also inhibited by superoxide dismutase, suggesting that superoxide can mediate the reductive release of iron from ferritin. Potassium superoxide in crown ether also promoted superoxide dismutase-inhibitable release of iron from ferritin. Catalase had little effect on the rate of iron release from ferritin; thus hydrogen peroxide appears to inhibit lipid peroxidation by preventing the formation of an initiating species rather than by inhibiting iron release from ferritin. EPR spin trapping with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide was used to observe free radical production in this system. Addition of ferritin to the xanthine oxidase system resulted in loss of the superoxide spin trap adduct suggesting an interaction between superoxide and ferritin. The resultant spectrum was that of a hydroxyl radical spin trap adduct which was abolished by the addition of catalase. These data suggest that ferritin may function in vivo as a source of iron for promotion of superoxide-dependent lipid peroxidation. Stimulation of lipid peroxidation but inhibition of hydroxyl radical formation by catalase suggests that, in this system, initiation is not via an iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1506960040,"Type beta transforming growth factor (beta TGF) purified from human platelets to homogeneity as judged by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis has been labeled with 125I to characterize its interaction with cellular receptors. Binding of 125I-beta TGF to target cells is temperature- and time-dependent, specific, saturable, and reversible. About 1.6-1.9 X 10(4) binding sites/cell with high affinity for beta TGF (Kd = 5.6-7.8 X 10(-11) M and 9.1-14 X 10(-11) M, respectively) are found in NRK-49F and BALB/c 3T3 cells. beta TGF receptors do not appear to undergo acute down-regulation by the ligand. Specific binding of 125I-beta TGF has been observed in several human, rat, and mouse fibroblast lines and in some, but not all, tumor-derived cell lines examined. 125I-beta TGF has been cross-linked to intact cells and isolated membrane preparations using disuccinimidyl suberate. Cells and isolated membranes from human, rat, and mouse origin affinity labeled with 125I-beta TGF exhibit a major labeled species of approximately 280 kilodaltons that has the properties of high affinity and specificity expected from a physiologically relevant beta TGF receptor. Minor labeled species of 70-90 kilodaltons are also labeled by 125I-beta TGF, but they correspond to molecular species with low apparent affinity (Kd approximately 10(-8) M) for 125I-beta TGF."
https://openalex.org/W2149267238,"The hemoprotein ligninase of Phanerochaete chrysosporium catalyzes, in the presence of H2O2, a variety of seemingly different oxidations in lignin and lignin model compounds. Here we show that the enzyme also catalyzes the oxidation of various methoxybenzenes. ESR spectroscopy shows that the compounds are oxidized to aryl cation radicals. These decompose, evidently by H2O addition. Thus, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene is converted to p-benzoquinone and methanol. We propose a unified mechanism, based on formation of aryl cation radicals, to explain the various reactions catalyzed by the ligninase."
https://openalex.org/W1485119690,"An enzyme complex with ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, cytochrome c oxidase, and ubiquinol oxidase activities was purified from a detergent extract of the plasma membrane of aerobically grown Paracoccus denitrificans. This ubiquinol oxidase consists of seven polypeptides and contains two b cytochromes, cytochrome c1, cytochrome aa3, and a previously unreported c-type cytochrome. This c-type cytochrome has an apparent Mr of 22,000 and an alpha absorption maximum at 552 nm. Retention of this c cytochrome through purification presumably accounts for the independence of ubiquinol oxidase activity on added cytochrome c. Ubiquinol oxidase can be separated into a 3-subunit bc1 complex, a 3-subunit c-aa3 complex, and a 57-kDa polypeptide. This, together with detection of covalently bound heme and published molecular weights of cytochrome c1 and the subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, allows tentative identification of most of the subunits of ubiquinol oxidase with the prosthetic groups present. Ubiquinol oxidase contains cytochromes corresponding to those of the mitochondrial bc1 complex, cytochrome c oxidase complex, and a bound cytochrome c. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity of the complex is inhibited by inhibitors of the mitochondrial bc1 complex. Thus it seems likely that the pathway of electron transfer through the bc1 complex of ubiquinol oxidase is similar to that through the mitochondrial bc1 complex. The number of polypeptides present is less than half the number in the corresponding mitochondrial complexes. This structural simplicity may make ubiquinol oxidase from P. denitrificans a useful system with which to study the mechanisms of electron transfer and energy transduction in the bc1 and cytochrome c oxidase sections of the respiratory chain."
https://openalex.org/W1634735131,"Calmodulin has recently been shown to form exceptionally tight, calcium-dependent complexes with several natural peptides (Kdiss greater than 10(-7) M). These peptides were demonstrated to be capable of forming basic, amphiphilic alpha-helices. To further illustrate the importance of this structural feature for calmodulin binding, several other amphiphilic alpha-helical peptides were tested for their ability to bind calmodulin. To monitor complexes of high affinity (greater than 10(8) M-1), a new competition assay was devised with Sepharose 4B-conjugated melittin. Stoichiometries were assessed by electrophoresis and equilibrium size exclusion chromatography. Three peptides, which were designed to form idealized amphiphilic alpha-helices were tested. The basic peptides, N alpha-9-fluorenylmethoxycarboxyl-(FMOC)-(Leu-Lys-Lys-Leu-Leu-Lys-L eu)1 and FMOC-(Leu-Lys-Lys-Leu-Leu-Lys-Leu)2 bind calmodulin in a 1:1 complex with dissociation constants of 150 and 3 nM, respectively. The acidic peptide, FMOC-(Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu-Leu-Glu-Leu)2 failed to bind calmodulin, even at micromolar concentrations. Complex formation between calmodulin and the 14-residue basic peptide leads to an increase in the helicity of the complex which is attributed to an increase of about 50% in the helicity of the peptide. Calmodulin also interacts with the neutral alpha-helical peptide toxin delta-hemolysin. Concomitant with binding, the fluorescence maximum of the unique Trp residue increases 2-fold and is blue-shifted. A dissociation constant could not be unambiguously estimated though, since delta-hemolysin has a strong tendency to self-aggregate. The above data support our hypothesis that a basic, amphiphilic alpha-helix is a structural feature which underlies the calmodulin-binding properties common to a variety of peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1495821285,"We report here the large scale purification of DNA topoisomerase II from calf thymus glands, using the unknotting of naturally knotted P4 phage DNA as an assay for enzymatic activity. Topoisomerase II was purified more than 1300-fold as compared to the whole cell homogenate, with 22% yield. Analysis of the purified enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two bands of apparent molecular masses of 125 and 140 kDa. Tryptic maps of the two bands indicated that they derive from the same protein. Using these fragments, specific polyclonal antisera to topoisomerase II were raised in rabbits. Immunoblotting of whole cell lysates from various species indicated that topoisomerase II is well conserved among mammals and has a native subunit molecular mass of 180 kDa. Analytical sedimentation and gel filtration were used to determine a sedimentation coefficient of 9.8 S and a Stokes radius of 68 A. The calculated solution molecular mass of 277 kDa implies a dimer structure in solution. The purified topoisomerase II unknots P4 DNA in an ATP-dependent manner and is highly stimulated in its relaxation activity by ATP. A DNA-stimulated ATPase activity, as has been found with other type II topoisomerases, is associated with the purified enzyme. Approximate kinetic parameters for the ATPase reaction were determined to be: a Vmax of 0.06 nmol of ATP/(micrograms of protein) (min) and Km of 0.2 mM in the absence of DNA, and a Vmax of 0.2 nmol of ATP/(micrograms of protein) (min) and Km of 0.4 mM ATP in the presence of supercoiled plasmid DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1484531401,"Biosynthesis of the glycoprotein tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) by human fibroblasts in culture has been characterized by functional assays, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry with a monospecific antiserum. As determined by radiolabeling with [35S]methionine, immunoprecipitation, and analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the secreted form of TIMP had an Mr of 29,000, whereas the form associated with the cell layer had an Mr of 24,000. Unstimulated human lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) secreted TIMP at the rate of approximately 2 micrograms/10(6) cells/24 h, and normal foreskin fibroblasts (HS 27) and skin fibroblasts from a patient with Hurler's disease (GM 1391) secreted TIMP at 0.3 and 0.2 micrograms/10(6) cells/24 h, respectively. Secretion of TIMP was stimulated up to 10-fold by treating the cells with 20-100 ng/ml of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate or 10 units/ml of human interleukin 1. In the stimulated HFL-1 cells, TIMP accounted for 0.03-0.09% of the total [35S]methionine incorporated into protein, and 0.3-0.8% of the [35S]methionine in secreted protein. Although TIMP accounted for a relatively small proportion of total protein synthesis of the fibroblasts, greater than 80% of untreated and greater than 95% of stimulated fibroblasts synthesized TIMP, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence. The treatments of the human fibroblasts that increased TIMP secretion also induced synthesis and secretion of proenzyme forms of collagenase, indicating that degradative enzymes and their controlling inhibitors may be synthesized in parallel under certain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1583800473,"Treatment of isolated hepatocytes with the tumor-promoting agent, 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) produced a time- and dose-dependent, non-competitive inhibition of alpha 1-adrenergic responses, including the activation of phosphorylase, increase in Ca2+ efflux, increase in free cytosolic Ca2+, and release of myo-inositol-1,4,5-P3. The actions of [8-arginine] vasopressin (AVP) on liver cells were also inhibited by PMA, but the inhibition could be overcome by high AVP concentrations. No significant inhibition of beta-adrenergic and glucagon-mediated activation of phosphorylase was induced by PMA and no inhibitory or synergistic effects of PMA were observed on the dose-dependent activation of phosphorylase by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. In radioligand binding studies, PMA did not directly interfere with [3H]prazosin specific binding, the displacement of [3H]prazosin by (-)-norepinephrine nor with [3H]AVP specific binding to purified liver plasma membranes. Plasma membranes prepared from livers perfused with PMA exhibited a 30-44% reduction in [3H]prazosin binding capacity. Under identical conditions [3H]AVP binding was unchanged. The alpha 1-receptors remaining in membranes from PMA-treated livers had equivalent affinities for [3H]prazosin and (-)-norepinephrine, and were unaffected in terms of coupling to guanine nucleotide-regulating proteins as indicated by the ability of guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate to promote the conversion of the remaining alpha 1-receptors into a low affinity state. These data indicate that tumor promoters are potent antagonists of alpha 1-adrenergic and vasopressin (low dose) responses in liver. It is proposed that PMA acting via protein kinase C (which presumably mediates the action of PMA) exerts its inhibitory action on alpha 1-adrenergic responses at the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor itself and also at a site close to or before myo-inositol-1,4,5-P3 release."
https://openalex.org/W1516928547,"Noncollagenous bovine bone proteins were obtained from EDTA-solubilized extracts of adult bovine bone in the absence of denaturants. Native osteonectin was isolated from the noncollagenous bone proteins by ion-exchange chromatography using DEAE-Sephadex A-50 and DEAE-Sephadex A-25, followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. Comparison of the physical and chemical properties (i.e. electrophoric mobility, amino acid composition and pI) of this protein with those reported by Termine et al. (Termine, J.D., Belcourt, A.B., Conn, K.M., and Kleinman, H.K. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10403-10408) indicate that this protein is osteonectin. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses in the presence of 6 M guandinium chloride, 10 mM Ca2+, 10 mM EDTA, or 0.15 M NaCl all yielded a molecular weight of 29,100 +/- 900. 125I-Osteonectin underwent saturable and exchangeable binding to hydroxyapatite and calf skin collagen. Eleven mg of 125I-osteonectin bound to 1.0 g of hydroxyapatite with a Kd of 8 X 10(-8) M. The intrinsic fluorescence of bovine osteonectin was partially quenched when micromolar Ca2+ was added, indicating a high affinity Ca2+ interaction. Native osteonectin was found to reduce the rate of hydroxyapatite crystal seeded growth by 50% (1 IU) at a concentration of 1.6 X 10(-7) M at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C in 0.15 M NaCl. This makes osteonectin one of the most potent inhibitors of hydroxyapatite formation presently known and more than 5 times as effective as bone Gla protein (1 IU = 8 X 10(-7) M)."
https://openalex.org/W1483489765,"Addition of amiloride to A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cell membranes inhibited autophosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. The tyrosine phosphorylation of histone H2B catalyzed by an affinity-purified preparation of EGF receptor was also inhibited by amiloride. The inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to histone but competitive with ATP, suggesting that amiloride may act as an ATP analogue which causes the formation of nonproductive enzyme-substrate complexes. The tyrosine phosphorylation of histone H2B catalyzed by the purified EGF receptor was inhibited by amiloride at concentrations identical to those previously reported to block EGF action on cell proliferation (Ki = 350 microM). Amiloride similarly inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of the human placental insulin receptor and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor of Swiss 3T3 cells. Immunoprecipitation of the EGF receptor from A431 cells labeled for 24 h with [32P]phosphate demonstrated that amiloride decreased the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor on serine and threonine residues and blocked the effect of EGF to cause phosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine residues. Phosphoamino acid analysis of total cell proteins indicated that amiloride inhibited the increase in phosphotyrosine levels caused by EGF. We conclude that amiloride directly inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptors for EGF, insulin, and platelet-derived growth factor in in vitro and can mediate such actions in vivo. This effect of amiloride demonstrates that it is unsuitable as a drug to test the hypothesis that the stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter is essential for mitogenic signaling by growth factor receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1498270245,"We have determined the sequence of the 1000 base pairs of DNA preceding the coding region of the mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene. 700 base pairs upstream of the translation start codon (position + 1) is the sequence CAACT, separated by 50 base pairs from the sequence TAATAA; these sequences resemble controlling elements responsible for accurate and efficient transcription initiation in a variety of eukaryotic genes. The region between -244 and -101 consists of a 3-fold tandem repeat of a 48-base pair sequence. S1 mapping results indicate that the 5' termini of the multiple dihydrofolate reductase mRNAs are heterogeneous, with the major terminus at -115 and with minor termini in the regions of -275 and -450. In addition, a portion of the 5'-ward region of the gene from -543 to -405 is represented differentially in some, but not all, mouse dihydrofolate reductase mRNAs. The above findings are consistent with the presence of two transcription promoter elements in the 5' end of the mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene. This has been substantiated by inserting portions of the 5'-ward 1000 base pairs of the gene into modular dihydrofolate reductase plasmids. When such constructs are transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking dihydrofolate reductase, function can be restored with equal transfection frequency when sequences surrounding the 5' CAACT-TAATAA region at -700 or a complete 48-base pair repeat from the region of -148 to -101 are present in the plasmid construct."
https://openalex.org/W1555000737,"The hybrid pre-enzyme formed by fusion of the signal peptide of the OmpA protein, a major outer membrane protein of Escherichia coli, to Staphylococcal nuclease A, a protein secreted by Staphylococcus aureus, is translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli with concomitant cleavage of the signal peptide. A DNA fragment containing the coding sequence for the ompA signal peptide was initially ligated to a DNA fragment containing the coding sequence for nuclease A, with a linker sequence of 33 nucleotides separating the coding sequences. When this fused gene was induced, an enzymatically active nuclease was secreted into the periplasmic space; sequential Edman degradation of this protein revealed that the ompA signal peptide was removed at its normal cleavage site resulting in a modified version of the nuclease having 11 extra amino acid residues attached to the amino terminus of nuclease A. The 33 nucleotides between the coding sequences for the ompA signal peptide and the structural gene for nuclease A were subsequently deleted by synthetic oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis. The nuclease produced by this hybrid gene was secreted into the periplasmic space and by sequential Edman degradation was identical to nuclease A. Thus, the ompA signal peptide is able to direct the secretion of fused staphylococcal nuclease A, and signal peptide processing occurs at the normal cleavage site. When the hybrid gene is expressed under the control of the lpp promoter, nuclease A is produced to the extent of 10% of the total cellular protein."
https://openalex.org/W1558494805,"We designed a simple procedure for the purification of Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) from rabbit brain, using affinity chromatography with a new affinity adsorbent. The adsorbent was synthesized by attaching the amino residue of N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-9) to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose. H-9 is a potent competitive inhibitor of protein kinase C, cGMP-, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase with respect to ATP and exhibits inhibition constants of 18, 0.87, and 1.9 microM, respectively (Hidaka, H., Inagaki, M., Kawamoto, S., and Sasaki, Y. (1984) Biochemistry, 23, 5036). A 960-fold purification was achieved in the two-step procedure, which entailed DEAE-cellulose and the affinity chromatography. The resultant preparation was essentially homogeneous, as indicated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under conditions of denaturation with sodium dodecyl sulfate. The affinity of protein kinase C for the H-9-Sepharose was high, and the enzyme could not be eluted either by a high concentration of sodium chloride or by 40% glycerol. The protein kinase C could be eluted from H-9-Sepharose by the buffer containing both 0.2 M NaCl and 20% glycerol, thereby suggesting that the binding between protein kinase C and H-9-Sepharose was due to both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. H-9 coupled to Sepharose retained both cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases and protein kinase C, and these enzymes could be eluted separately by the buffer containing L-arginine, a potent inhibitor of these three kinases. The novel aspects of these three multifunctional protein kinases can thus be investigated using isoquinolinesulfonamide derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1533325937,"Rieske-type iron/sulfur proteins and several NADH-dependent oxygenases contain Fe/S clusters with similar spectral and magnetic properties. Purified Rieske iron/sulfur protein from Thermus thermophilus contains two apparently identical [2Fe-2S] clusters in a polypeptide having only four cysteine residues, and it has been proposed that each Fe/S cluster is coordinated to two cysteine S-atoms and to an unknown number of other non-sulfur atoms (Fee, J. A., Findling, K. L., Yoshida, T., Hille, R., Tarr, G. E., Hearshen, D. O., Dunham, W. R., Day, E. P., Kent, T. A., and Munck, E. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 124-133). We have examined the Rieske protein from Thermus and the phthalate dioxygenase from Pseudomonas cepacia with electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and pulsed EPR methods and report here evidence for the direct coordination of nitrogenous ligands to the Fe/S clusters in these proteins. The electron nuclear double resonance signals arising from 14N have been interpreted in terms of a strongly coupled ligand with AN = approximately 26-28 MHz and a weakly coupled ligand with AN = approximately 9 MHz. The pulsed EPR spectrum shows a rich pattern of lines in the Fourier transformed data having peaks in the range of 0.8 to 6.7 MHz. The lower frequency resonances are tentatively associated with coupling of the unpaired spin to the remote N-atoms of coordinated imidazole rings."
https://openalex.org/W1508697958,"cDNA containing the full coding region of mouse ornithine decarboxylase was isolated. The complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was determined by the dideoxy method, and the amino acid sequence of ornithine decarboxylase was thereby deduced. The protein contains 461 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 51,172. The isoelectric point is predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence to be 5.1. On the basis of its amino acid sequence, the protein is predicted to be comprised predominantly of alternating domains of alpha-helix and beta-sheet."
https://openalex.org/W1544004198,"The thermodynamic and EPR characteristics of the iron-sulfur clusters of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase have been examined in various subfractions and subunits of the enzyme. These were obtained by fragmentation of the enzyme with chaotropic agents and detergent and salt fractionation. We provide evidence for the presence of three tetranuclear clusters and five or six binuclear clusters, accounting well for the chemically determined iron content of this enzyme (22-24 atoms/molecule of FMN). Some of the clusters can be identified with EPR-detectable species in intact NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and, by combining information on subunit topography and spin-spin interactions between redox centers in the native enzyme, we propose a tentative scheme for the spatial organization of these iron-sulfur clusters in the enzyme and in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1641093167,"One gene coding for yeast cytoplasmic elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) was isolated by colony hybridization using a cDNA probe prepared from purified EF-1 alpha mRNA. A recombinant plasmid, pLB1, with a 6-kilobase yeast DNA insert, was found by hybrid selection and translation experiments to carry the entire gene. The nucleotide sequence of the gene with its 5'- and 3'-flanking regions was determined. The 5' and 3' ends of EF-1 alpha mRNA were localized by the S1 nuclease mapping technique. The cloned gene, called TEF1, encodes a protein of 458 amino acids (Mr = 50,071) in a single, uninterrupted reading frame. The amino acid sequence shows a strong homology with several domains of Artemia salina EF-1 alpha cytoplasmic factor, as evidenced by diagonal dot matrix analysis. Protein sequence homology is comparatively much lower with the yeast mitochondrial elongation factor. S1 nuclease mapping of the mRNA, hybridization analysis of chromosomal DNA using intragenic or extragenic DNA probes, and gene disruption experiments demonstrated the existence of two genes coding for the cytoplasmic elongation factor EF-1 alpha/haploid genome. The presence of an intact chromosomal TEF1 gene is not essential for growth of haploid yeast cells."
https://openalex.org/W1591674662,"Lisinopril (N alpha-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]L-lysyl-L-proline), a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, is an exceptionally selective affinity chromatography ligand for this enzyme. Affinity chromatography furnishes electrophoretically homogeneous enzyme directly from crude homogenates of rabbit lung tissue, a 1,000-fold purification; also, it affords a 100,000-fold enrichment of the more rare human plasma enzyme in a single step. The affinity of angiotensin-converting enzyme for the Sepharose-spacer-lisinopril matrix (Ki matrix = 1 X 10(-5) M) is weak compared to its affinity for free lisinopril (Ki = 1 X 10(-10) M). The capacity of the affinity column is described quantitatively as a function of Ki matrix, lisinopril, and enzyme concentrations. The recovery of bound enzyme is low in chromatography of crude tissue samples (10-40%), although it approaches a reversible process (70-100%) with pure enzyme. The holoenzyme is converted to Zn2+-free apoenzyme to effect removal of lisinopril. In this process, the rate constant for spontaneous dissociation of Zn2+ from free enzyme is 1 X 10(-2) s-1 (t 1/2 = 1 min), which places a lower limit of 3 X 10(-10) M on the dissociation constant of Zn2+ at neutral pH from angiotensin-converting enzyme. The exceptional selectivity of lisinopril as an affinity chromatography ligand for angiotensin-converting enzyme suggests it is among the most specific inhibitors designed for any enzyme."

Both mature mRNA transcripts and their peptide products, encoding either calcitonin or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are co-produced in identical thyroid C-cells, in a ratio of 95:1, respectively. These data suggest that the generation of the two mRNAs reflect the actions of a factor(s) dictating alternative RNA processing events."
https://openalex.org/W1592558087,"Toluene dioxygenase oxidizes toluene to (+)-cis-1(S),2(R)-dihydroxy-3-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene. This reaction is catalyzed by a multienzyme system that is induced in cells of Pseudomonas putida F1 during growth on toluene. One of the components of toluene dioxygenase has been purified to homogeneity and shown to be an iron-sulfur protein that has been designated ferredoxinTOL. The molecular weight of ferredoxinTOL was calculated to be 15,300, and the purified protein was shown to contain 2 g of atoms each of iron- and acid-labile sulfur which appear to be organized as a single [2Fe-2S]cluster. Solutions of ferredoxinTOL were brown in color and showed absorption maxima at 277, 327, and 460 nm. A shoulder in the spectrum of the oxidized protein was discernible at 575 nm. Reduction with sodium dithionite or NADH and ferredoxinTOL reductase resulted in a decrease in visible absorbance at 460 and 575 nm, with a concomitant shift in absorption maxima to 382 and 438 nm. The redox potential of ferredoxinTOL was estimated to be -109 mV. In the oxidized state, the protein is diamagnetic. However, upon reduction it exhibited prominent electron paramagnetic resonance signals with anisotropy in g values (gx = 1.81, gy = 1.86, and gz = 2.01). Anaerobic reductive titrations revealed that ferredoxinTOL is a one-electron carrier that accepts electrons from NADH in a reaction that is mediated by a flavoprotein (ferredoxinTOL reductase). The latter is the first component in the toluene dioxygenase system. Reduced ferredoxinTOL can transfer electrons to cytochrome c or to a terminal iron-sulfur dioxygenase (ISP-TOL) which catalyzes the incorporation of molecular oxygen into toluene and related aromatic substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1481505704,"The regulatory region of the Escherichia coli cya gene was analyzed by using S1 nuclease mapping and in vitro transcription experiments. The cya gene was transcribed, both in vivo and in vitro, from one major promoter (P2) and two weak promoters (P1 and P1') that are located about 200 base pairs upstream of P2. The transcription from P2 was specifically inhibited by cAMP-CRP (cAMP receptor protein) in vitro. This regulatory mechanism was shown to be physiologically relevant through quantitative analyses of the cya mRNA in intact cells by S1 and dot blot assays. DNase I protection experiments revealed that cAMP-CRP binds to the cya DNA region between +11 and -20, in which a consensus CRP binding sequence is present. Moreover, it was found that cAMP-CRP alters the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region, thus inhibiting the transcription of the cya gene."
https://openalex.org/W1551529449,"Two novel peptide analogs, N alpha-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]L-alanyl-L-proline and the corresponding L-lysyl-L-proline derivative, have been demonstrated to be potent competitive inhibitors of purified rabbit lung angiotensin-converting enzyme: Ki = 2 and 1 X 10(-10) M, respectively, at pH 7.5, 25 degrees C, and 0.3 M chloride ion. Second-order rate constants for addition of these inhibitors to enzyme under the same conditions are in the range 1-2 X 10(6) M-1 s-1; first-order rate constants for dissociation of the EI complexes are in the range 1-4 X 10(-4) s-1. The association rate constants are similar to those measured for D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline, captopril, but the dissociation rate constants are severalfold slower and account for the higher affinity of these inhibitors for the enzyme. The dissociation constant for the EI complex containing N alpha-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]L-alanyl-L-proline is pH-dependent, and reaches a minimum at approximately pH 6: Ki = 4 +/- 1 X 10(-11) M. The pH dependence is consistent either with a model for which the protonation state of the secondary nitrogen atom in the inhibitor determines binding affinity, or one for which ionizations on the enzyme alone influence affinity for these inhibitors. The affinity of this inhibitor for the zinc-free apoenzyme is 2 X 10(4) times less than for the zinc-free apoenzyme is 2 X 10(4) times less than that for the holoenzyme. If considered as a collected product inhibitor, N alpha-[(S)-1-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]L-alanyl-L-proline appears to derive an additional factor of 375 M in its affinity for the enzyme compared to that of the two products of its hypothetical hydrolysis, a consequence of favorable entropy effects."
https://openalex.org/W1500677746,"The purified lipoxygenase of rabbit reticulocytes converts arachidonic acid at 0 degrees C to 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE) and to 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE) via reactions which involve hydrogen abstraction at C-13 and C-10, respectively. At 37 degrees C the enzyme converts arachidonic acid to additional products which were identified as 13-hydroxy-14,15-epoxy-5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid, 8,15-dihydroperoxy-5,9,11,13- and 5,15-dihydroperoxy-6, 6,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acids (8,15-diHPETE and 5,15-HPETE, respectively) and diastereoisomers of 8,15-dihydroxy-5,9,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (8,15-diHPETEs). The 8,15- and 5,15-diHPETEs were formed by double lipoxygenation since each incorporated 2 molecules of 18O2 and since their synthesis from 15-HPETE was blocked under anaerobic conditions. The 8,15-diHETEs each incorporated 18O from 18O2 at C-15 and were found to arise from nonenzymatic hydrolysis of an epoxytriene which was identified as 14,15-leukotriene A4 by trapping in acidic methanol. This compound was a major product of 15-HPETE in anaerobic incubations. The conversion of 15-HPETE to 14,15-leukotriene A4 was inhibited by the lipoxygenase inhibitors nordihydroguairetic acid and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid. The 14,15-leukotriene A4 synthase and 15-lipoxygenase activities were inhibited by 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid in a similar time-dependent manner. The results support a mechanism whereby 14,15-leukotriene A4 is synthesized from 15-HPETE by a further enzymatic step carried out by the reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase via hydrogen abstraction at C-10 and a redox cycle of the non-heme iron atom of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1605446309,"The A and B proteins encoded by the temperate bacteriophage Mu are involved in the high efficiency DNA transposition reaction which is the distinguishing feature of this phage. The genes encoding these early proteins were cloned in an expression vector under the control of the bacteriophage lambda leftward promoter. Under optimal conditions gpB was overproduced to account for 15% of the total cellular protein. The protein was purified to near homogeneity as determined by silver staining. Sequence analysis of the N terminus confirmed the identity of the purified protein as gpB. Proteolytic processing of the B protein does not occur at the amino terminus; the terminal methionine residue is quantitatively deformylated. The protein, which was found to be basic and a general DNA binding protein, was insoluble at low ionic strength in the absence, but not in the presence, of DNA. The B protein also displayed a tendency to aggregate at high ionic strength where it was soluble in the absence of DNA. In addition, the protein was characterized as to its amino acid composition and extinction coefficient at 280 nm. The purified protein is active in a soluble in vitro transposition-replication system."
https://openalex.org/W1551985659,"Hypothyroidism is associated with an enhanced sensitivity of rat fat cells to the inhibitory action of adenosine and adenosine agonists. The sensitivity of the forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP response of rat fat cells to the adenosine agonist N6-phenylisopropyladenosine is amplified 3-fold by hypothyroidism. Forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity is more sensitive to inhibition by this adenosine agonist in membranes of fat cells isolated from hypothyroid as compared to euthyroid rats. Hypothyroidism does not significantly alter the number of affinity of binding sites for N6-cyclohexyl[3H]adenosine or N6-phenylisopropyladenosine in membranes of rat fat cells. GTP-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase was markedly enhanced in the hypothyroid state, suggesting an alteration in the inhibitory regulatory component (Ni)-mediated control of adenylate cyclase. Incubating membranes with [alpha-32P]NAD+ and preactivated pertussis toxin results in the radiolabeling of two peptides with Mr = 40,000 and 41,000 as visualized in autoradiograms of polyacrylamide gels run in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The amount of label incorporated by pertussis toxin into these two peptides (putative subunits of Ni) per mg of protein of membrane is increased 2-3-fold in the hypothyroid state. The amount of the stimulatory regulatory component, Ns, in fat cell membranes is not altered by hypothyroidism (Malbon, C. C., Graziano, M. P., and Johnson, G. L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3254-3260). The amplified response of hypothyroid rat fat cells to the inhibitory action of adenosine appears to reflect a specific increase in the activity and abundance of Ni."
https://openalex.org/W1577515743,"The role of specific granules and cytochrome b in superoxide (O(2)) release was studied by comparing the effects of three different stimuli on normal human neutrophils, neutrophils congenitally deficient in specific granules, and granule-free normal neutrophil cytoplasts. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulated normal neutrophils to release more O(2) than did N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe), which stimulated greater release than the calcium ionophore A23187. Neutrophils lacking specific granules produced variable amounts of O(2) in response to all stimuli. Stimulation with PMA, fMet-Leu-Phe, and A23187 produced maximal rates of O(2) release that were 32, 55, and 21% of that by normal cells. Likewise, granule-free neutrophil cytoplasts released 24, 20, and 0% of the O(2) released by intact cells. These data suggest that the stimuli require different mechanisms for activation. Three subcellular fractions (azurophil granule rich, specific granule rich, and plasma membrane rich) were separated by Percoll gradients from normal resting and stimulated neutrophils. In resting neutrophils, the cytochrome b content in the plasma membrane was 31% of the total, with the rest in the specific granule-rich fraction. Ten minutes after stimulation, PMA, fMet-Leu-Phe, and A23187 induced translocation of 27, 8, and 49%, respectively, of the cytochrome b from the specific granule-rich fraction to the plasma membrane. Although our data support a role for specific granule factors in A23187-induced O(2) release, there is no correlation between the amount of cytochrome b incorporated into the plasma membrane and the extent of O(2) production activated by the different stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1486686751,"A preliminary EPR investigation of iron accumulation in apoferritin has identified paramagnetic species generated during the early stage of iron deposition within the apoprotein shell. A featureless resonance at g' = 4.3, attributable to solitary high spin Fe3+ ions bound to the protein, is generated when Fe(II) is added to apoferritin at a level of 0.5 Fe/subunit (12 Fe/molecule) followed by air oxidation. This resonance accounts for 36% of the added iron. The remainder is EPR-silent and is probably present as oligomeric Fe3+ species. The intensity of the g' = 4.3 signal is reduced 3-fold upon anaerobic addition of 5 Fe(II)/subunit as a new iron resonance with g' values of 1.94, 1.87, and 1.80 is generated. This signal is observable only at temperatures near that of liquid helium and resists saturation at power levels of 100 milliwatts. Its distinctive g-factors, temperature dependence, and saturation characteristics suggest that it arises from a spin-coupled Fe(II)-Fe(III) dimer having a net electron spin of 1/2. In accord with this idea, the signal disappears when air is admitted, presumably because of oxidation of the Fe(II). The proposed mixed valence dimer may be an important intermediate formed during the initiation of core formation within the protein shell."
https://openalex.org/W1516329113,"An improved method was developed to align related protein sequences and search for homology. A glutamine amide transfer domain was identified in an NH2-terminal segment of GMP synthetase from Escherichia coli. Amino acid residues 1-198 in GMP synthetase are homologous with the glutamine amide transfer domain in trpG X D-encoded anthranilate synthase component II-anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase and the related pabA-encoded p-aminobenzoate synthase component II. This result supports a model for gene fusion in which a trpG-related glutamine amide transfer domain was recruited to augment the function of a primitive NH3-dependent GMP synthetase. Sequence analyses emphasize that glutamine amide transfer domains are thus far found only at the NH2 terminus of fused proteins. Two rules are formulated to explain trpG and trpG-related fusions. (i) trpG and trpG-related genes must have translocated immediately up-stream of genes destined for fusion in order to position a glutamine amide transfer domain at the NH2 terminus after fusion. (ii) trpG and trpG-related genes could not translocate adjacent to a regulatory region at the 5' end of an operon. These rules explain known trpG-like fusions and explain why trpG and pabA are not fused to trpE and pabB, respectively. Alignment searches of GMP synthetase with two other enzymes that bind GMP, E. coli amidophosphoribosyltransferase and human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, suggest a structurally homologous segment which may constitute a GMP binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1533900600,"Abstract Novel enzymatic activity which splits diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (Ap4A) phosphorolytically has been found in extracts from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One of the two alpha,beta-anhydride bonds between Ap4A phosphate residues undergoes phosphorolysis, and ATP (pppA) plus ADP (ppA) are the products of the reaction according to the equation: AppppA + P*i----pppA + p*pA The reaction is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions; Mn2+ or Mg2+ sustain the greatest rates of reaction. Among analogues of the Ap4A substrate, Ap5A and Gp4G, but not p4A and Ap3A, are substrates, and corresponding products are p4A plus ADP, and GTP plus GDP, the phosphate being incorporated into the nucleoside 5'-diphosphates. In the reactions, phosphate can be substituted with arsenate. Arsenolysis of Ap4A, Ap5A, or Gp4G leads to ATP plus AMP, p4A plus AMP, and GTP plus GMP, respectively. The name diadenosine tetraphosphate alpha,beta-phosphorylase (ADP-forming) is proposed for the new enzyme. The phosphorylase has been purified to apparent homogeneity and behaves as a single polypeptide chain of Mr = 40,000. Optimum activity of the enzyme is at pH 8.0 and the sulfhydryl groups are essential for catalysis. At saturating Ap4A, the rate constant for the reaction is 36 s-1 and the Km value for Ap4A is 60 microM (37 degrees C, 50 mM Hepes/KOH (pH 8.2), 500 microM MnCl2, 10 mM K2HPO4, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% glycerol). The Km values for phosphate and arsenate are 1 and 3 mM, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1485013487,"Both cholera toxin and pertussis toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of purified bovine brain tubulin. The effect of cholera toxin was evident in the absence or presence of nucleotides. In contrast, pertussis toxin required adenine nucleotides for its ADP-ribosylating activity. ATP, ATP gamma S, App(NH)p, deoxy-ATP, and ADP all supported pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylations in the absence or presence of EDTA, suggesting that nucleotide hydrolysis was not involved. Adenine nucleotides also promoted pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of heat-treated bovine serum albumin. This result suggests that adenine nucleotides directly affect pertussis toxin. ATP stimulation of pertussis toxin-catalyzed hydrolysis of NAD to ADP-ribose supports this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1507735847,"An epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-interactive monoclonal antibody (151-IgG) that inhibits EGF binding to PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells and to various other cell types has been produced. The hybridoma clone was obtained by fusing Sp2/O-Ag14 myeloma cells with splenocytes from Balb/C mice which had been immunized with n-octyl glucoside-solubilized protein from isolated PC12 cell plasma membranes. The antibody is an IgG which binds to protein A. 151-IgG did not bind EGF. At 0.5 degrees C 151-IgG was directly competitive for EGF binding to PC12 cells. It also inhibited EGF binding to bovine corneal endothelial cells, rabbit corneal fibroblasts, human foreskin fibroblasts, and normal rat kidney cells, and it slightly enchanced EGF binding to SW 3T3 cells. PC12 cells have the same number of binding sites for 151-IgG as for EGF (approximately 27,000 sites/cell). 151-IgG inhibited the photoactivatable cross-linking of EGF to a protein of Mr 170,000 in PC12 cells. 151-IgG inhibited the EGF-stimulated incorporation of [3H]thymidine into quiescent bovine corneal endothelial cells, rabbit corneal endothelial cells, epithelial normal rat kidney cells, and SW 3T3 cells while it enhanced the EGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation into quiescent human foreskin fibroblasts. 151-IgG by itself possessed intrinsic EGF-like activity for human fibroblasts but not for the other cells tested. This suggests that there is a difference in EGF receptors and/or processing in these normal cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1581582461,"In vivo, T7 DNA replication is initiated 15% of the distance from the genetic left end of the chromosome. This site, the primary origin of replication, consists of a 200-base pair (bp) intergenic segment from 14.5 to 15.0% within which are located two tandem T7 RNA polymerase promoters (phi 1.1A and phi 1.1B) followed by a 61-bp AT-rich (79% A + T) region. A fragment of T7 DNA containing the primary origin has been inserted into plasmids in order to facilitate studies on initiation in vitro. Initiation of DNA synthesis can be reconstituted using T7 RNA polymerase, T7 DNA polymerase, and T7 origin-containing plasmid DNAs. DNA synthesis is stimulated greatly by the T7 gene 4 protein, an enzyme that has helicase and primase activities. When T7 gene 4 protein is present, replication primarily yields partially replicated Y-form molecules as observed by electron microscopy. Synthesis is unidirectional and the branches of the Y-form molecules are uniform in size, with the branch point of the Y located at the origin. Using restriction enzyme analysis, DNA synthesis has been shown to proceed in the same direction (rightward with respect to the T7 genetic map) as transcription from the two promoters located at the origin. Initiation of DNA synthesis in the opposite direction requires the addition of a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (Fuller, C.W., and Richardson, C.C. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3197-3206). The initial products of DNA synthesis have been analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These DNAs have 10 to 60 ribonucleotides covalently linked to their 5' termini. These RNA primers arise by transcription from each of the two promoters, phi 1.1A and phi 1.1B, located within the primary origin."
https://openalex.org/W1594268788,"The present study demonstrated that dog reticulocytes had considerable amounts of (Na,K)-ATPase, but lost it rapidly during maturation into erythrocytes. Furthermore, reticulocytes from dogs possessing erythrocytes characterized with high (Na,K)-ATPase activity and high K, low Na concentrations (HK dogs; Maede, Y., Inaba, M., and Taniguchi, N. (1983) Blood 61,493-499) had more ouabain binding sites than cells from normal dogs (LK dogs). Our results were as follows: i) The maximal binding capacities (Bmax) for ouabain binding at equilibrium were approximately 0 and 1,500 binding sites/cell in LK and HK dog erythrocytes, respectively. ii) Reticulocytes from LK dogs possess approximately 5,700 ouabain binding sites/cell. iii) The Bmax value for ouabain in HK reticulocytes was about 10,000 sites/cell, being 2-fold that in LK reticulocytes. iv) Ouabain-sensitive fluxes of 24Na and 42K in each type of reticulocyte were compatible with the number of ouabain binding sites on the cells. v) Ouabain binding capacity, as well as (Na,K)-ATPase activity, in the reticulocytes from LK dogs fell rapidly to nearly zero during the maturation into erythrocytes. vi) Although reticulocytes from HK dogs also showed a similar regression of (Na,K)-ATPase during maturation, they retained a certain number of ouabain binding sites even after maturation, resulting in the high activity of (Na,K)-ATPase in HK erythrocyte membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1501996424,"The existence of multiple affinity states for the opiate receptor in neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells has been demonstrated by competition binding studies with tritiated diprenorphine and [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE). In the presence of 10 mM Mg2+, all receptors exist in a high affinity state with Kd = 1.88 +/- 0.16 nM. Addition of 10 microM guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) decreased the affinity of DADLE to Kd = 8.08 +/- 0.93 nM. However, in the presence of 100 mM Na+, which is required for opiate inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, analysis of competition binding data revealed three sites: the first, consisting of 17.5% of total receptor population has a Kd = 0.38 +/- 0.18 nM; the second, 50.6% of the population, has a Kd = 6.8 +/- 2.2 nM; and the third, 31.9% of the population, has a Kd of 410 +/- 110 nM. Thus, in the presence of sodium, a high affinity complex between receptor (R), GTP binding component (Ni), and ligand (L) was formed which was different from that formed in the absence of sodium. These multiple affinity states of receptor in the hybrid cells are agonist-specific, and the percentage of total opiate receptor in high affinity state is relatively constant in various concentrations of Na+. Multiple affinity states of opiate receptor can be demonstrated further by Scatchard analysis of saturation binding studies with [3H]DADLE. In the presence of Mg2+, or Gpp(NH)p, analysis of [3H]DADLE binding demonstrates that opiate receptor can exist in a single affinity state, with apparent Kd values of [3H]DADLE in 10 mM Mg2+ = 1.75 +/- 0.28 nM and in 10 microM Gpp(NH)p = 0.85 +/- 0.12 nM. There is a reduction of Bmax value from 0.19 +/- 0.02 nM in the presence of Mg2+ to 0.14 +/- 0.03 nM in the presence of Gpp(NH)p. In the presence of 100 mM Na+, Scatchard analysis of saturation binding of [3H]DADLE reveals nonlinear plots; two-site analysis of the curves yields Kd = 0.43 +/- 0.09 and 7.9 +/- 3.2 nM. These Kd values are analogous to that obtained with competition binding studies. Again, this conversion of single site binding Scatchard plots to multiple sites binding plots in the presence of Na+ is restricted to 3H-agonist binding only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1532727976,"A method is described for the separate determination of cAMP intracellularly bound to the regulatory moieties (RI and RII) of protein kinase I and II. The cAMP endogenously bound to RI or RII in hepatocyte extract was adsorbed to protein A-agarose beads coated with antibodies against RI or RII. The endogenously bound cAMP was eluted from the washed beads with dilute acetic acid before being assayed. By all criteria tested, the present method did not perturb the intracellularly established equilibrium between bound and free cAMP. Stabilization of R X cAMP complexes was achieved by including sulfate in the extraction medium and sulfate/glycerol during the subsequent steps. Hepatocytes were isolated from fed male rats and contained about 0.25 pmol of RI and 0.2 pmol of RII per 10(5) cells. An intracellular titration of the cAMP binding sites of RI and RII was achieved by incubating the cells with various concentrations (1 pM to 10 nM) of glucagon. The fractional saturation of RI and RII was always similar, being 20% in nonstimulated cells. 50% saturation occurred when free cAMP was 0.46 pmol/10(5) cells. A Scatchard plot of the data for the endogenous cAMP binding suggested that cAMP interacted with RI and RII in a slightly positively cooperative manner. About 5% of the intracellularly bound cAMP was sedimentable at 10,000 X g. The apparent affinity of these particulate-associated binding sites was similar to that of soluble RI and RII. Under the conditions used no evidence was obtained for cAMP binding to other proteins than RI and RII."
https://openalex.org/W2169710079,"The effects of cyclic nucleotides on elastin synthesis were studied in ligamentum nuchae fibroblasts by adding exogenous cyclic nucleotide derivatives or beta-adrenergic agents to cell culture medium. Elastin synthesis was enhanced (approximately 80%) by dibutyryl cGMP (Bt2cGMP) in concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 100 nM. Two other cGMP derivatives, 8-bromoguanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP) and 2'-deoxy-cGMP, were also potent stimulators of elastin synthesis. In the absence of calcium, basal elastin production was substantially decreased (40% of control) and cGMP analogs no longer stimulated elastin synthesis, suggesting a role for calcium in the cGMP response. Bt2cAMP had no demonstrable effect on elastin production except at high concentrations which produced a nonspecific decrease equivalent to the decrease in total protein synthesis. Similarly, elevation of endogenous cellular cAMP levels by beta-adrenergic stimulation produced no change in elastin production. When 8-Br-cGMP was added to cells together with Bt2cAMP, cGMP-dependent stimulation of elastin production was abolished by cAMP in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest a coordinated means by which elastin production is controlled in ligament cells, i.e. increased cGMP levels lead to a stimulation of elastin production that is reversed by cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W1484305997,"The kinetics of light-driven electron flow and the nature of redox centers at apparent photosynthetic membrane growth initiation sites in Rhodopseudomans sphaeroides were compared to those of intracytoplasmic photosynthetic membranes. In sucrose gradients, these membrane growth sites sediment more slowly than intracytoplasmic membrane-derived chromatophores and form an upper pigmented band. Cytochromes c1, c2, b561, and b566 were demonstrated in the upper fraction by redox potentiometry; c-type cytochromes were also detected electrophoretically. Signals characteristic of light-induced reaction center bacteriochlorophyll triplet and photooxidized reaction center bacteriochlorophyll dimer states were observed by EPR spectroscopy but the Rieske iron-sulfur signal of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c2 oxidoreductase was present at a 3-fold reduced level on a reaction center basis in comparison to chromatophores. Flash-induced absorbance measurements of the upper pigmented fraction demonstrated reaction center primary and secondary semiquinone anion acceptor signals, but cytochrome b561 photoreduction and cytochrome c1/c2 reactions occurred at slow rates. This fraction was enriched approximately 2- and 4-fold in total b- and c-type cytochromes, respectively, per reaction center over chromatophores, but photoreducible b-type cytochrome was lower. Measurements of respiratory activity indicated a 1.6-fold higher level of succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase/reaction center than in chromatophores, but the apparent turnover rates in both preparations were low. Overall, the results suggest that complete cycles of rapid, light-driven electron flow do not occur merely by introduction of newly synthesized reaction centers into respiratory membrane, but that subsequent synthesis and assembly of appropriate components of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c2 oxidoreductase is required."
https://openalex.org/W1509570104,"Computer simulations of equilibrium binding studies of a mixture of two labeled ligands binding competitively to a single class of identical and independent sites (receptors) were performed to investigate how ligand heterogeneity affects the observed data in such studies. The simulated data are presented in Scatchard plots. Ligand heterogeneity was generally found to be indistinguishable from the case of a homogeneous ligand when usual experimental conditions applied (that is, Scatchard plots of the data were straight lines). Some factors that increased the probability of recognizing heterogeneity in the system were identified, however. These are 1) a large difference between the dissociation constants of the two ligands, 2) a high concentration of receptors relative to the dissociation constant of the higher-affinity ligand, 3) a high concentration of the lower-affinity ligand relative to that of the higher-affinity ligand, 4) a high specific activity of the lower-affinity ligand relative to that of the higher-affinity ligand, and 5) lack of experimental error. When ligand heterogeneity (under certain conditions) did cause curvilinearity in the Scatchard plot, the curve formed was always concave-downwards. Thus, ligand heterogeneity may occasionally mimic positive cooperativity, but never mimics negative cooperativity or multiple classes of binding sites. Implications of these findings for equilibrium binding studies involving lipoproteins (which are generally isolated as heterogeneous mixtures of particles) are discussed in detail. These findings are also relevant to equilibrium binding studies using ligands which are mixtures of stereoisomers or which contain chemical or radiochemical impurities."
https://openalex.org/W1480862012,"The human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene was found to be undermethylated only in its 5' promoter region; the remaining CCGG residues in the 30-kilobase (kb) DHFR gene were insensitive to digestion by HpaII. Each of 27 CpG residues that were part of an HpaII or HhaI cutting site within a 1.1-kb segment of the DHFR gene promoter region were found to be unmethylated. All 80 copies of the DHFR gene in methotrexate-resistant HeLa cell line exhibited this pattern of undermethylation of only the promoter region. This same region was shown to be DNase I hypersensitive in chromatin from normal cells and from those cells in which the DHFR gene was amplified. Again, all copies of the amplified gene exhibited DNase I hypersensitivity of the promoter region. The remainder of the 30-kb DHFR gene is both completely methylated and insensitive to DNase I digestion. Detailed mapping of the DNase I-hypersensitive region revealed four strong cutting sites within a 500-base pair segment immediately upstream from the DHFR coding sequence and a weak cutting site within intron I. Two of the strong DNase I cutting sites in chromatin were also sensitive to S1 nuclease nicking when this DNA fragment was part of supercoiled plasmid DNA. Promoter undermethylation and DNase I hypersensitivity, features previously shown for specialized and inducible genes, have now been shown to be characteristic of the constitutively expressed DHFR gene. That these features characterize all copies of the amplified DHFR gene in a methotrexate-resistant cell line suggest that all gene copies are transcriptionally active."
https://openalex.org/W1505188757,"Monomeric regulatory subunit (R) fragments of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase were compared with the parent dimeric R. The monomeric fragments were generated by either endogenous proteolysis of rabbit muscle R or by trypsin treatment of bovine heart R in the holoenzyme form. During isolation of pure R from rabbit muscle, carboxyl-terminal fragments of Mr = 42,000 (42 K) and Mr = 37,000 by denaturing gels are generated by endogenous proteolysis. Although the autophosphorylation site is retained, the 42 K is not dimeric (as is its native 56 K precursor) but, in contrast to the monomeric 37 K product, actively reassociates with purified catalytic subunit (C). Several lines of evidence indicate a type II R origin of the 42 K. N-terminal sequence analysis of the 42 K shows some homology with known bovine RI, RII, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase sequences. Both cyclic nucleotide-binding sites (two/42 K or 37 K) and the site selectivity of cAMP analogs are retained in the monomeric fragments. When purified bovine heart holoenzyme, which contains a dimeric Mr = 56,000 R (denaturing gel analysis) and two C subunits, is treated with trypsin followed by separation procedures, the product is a fully recovered active enzyme with an unaltered ratio of cAMP binding to catalytic activity. From Mr considerations, the product is a dimer containing one intact C and a proteolyzed R of Mr = 48,000 on denaturing gels. This dimeric enzyme is not significantly different from the parent tetramer in cAMP concentration dependence (Hill constant = 1.63), [3H]cAMP dissociation behavior (both intrasubunit cAMP-binding sites are present), stimulation of [3H]cIMP binding by site-selective cAMP analogs, and synergism between two analogs in kinase activation. The data indicate that 1) proteolytic cleavage of the native R dimer can cause monomerization without appreciably affecting the inhibition of C and 2) essentially all of the cAMP binding cooperativity is an intrasubunit interaction."
https://openalex.org/W193230483,"The substrate specificity of beta-collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum has been investigated by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of more than 50 tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexapeptides covering the P3 to P3' subsites of the substrate. The choice of peptides was patterned after sequences found in the alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains of type I collagen. Each peptide contained either a 2-furanacryloyl (FA) or cinnamoyl (CN) group in subsite P2 or the 4-nitrophenylalanine (Nph) residue in subsite P1. Hydrolysis of the P1-P1' bond produces an absorbance change in these chromophoric peptides that has been used to quantitate the rates of their hydrolysis under first order conditions ([S] much less than KM) from kcat/KM values have been obtained. The identity of the amino acids in all six subsites (P3-P3') markedly influences the hydrolysis rates. In general, the best substrates have Gly in subsites P3 and P1', Pro or Ala in subsite P2', and Hyp, Arg, or Ala in subsite P3'. This corresponds well with the frequency of occurrence of these residues in the Gly-X-Y triplets of collagen. In contrast, the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrates do not have residues from collagen-like sequences in subsites P2 and P1. For example, CN-Nph-Gly-Pro-Ala is the best known substrate for beta-collagenase with a kcat/KM value of 4.4 X 10(7) M-1 min-1, in spite of the fact that there is neither Pro nor Ala in P2 or Hyp nor Ala in P1. These results indicate that the previously established rules for the substrate specificity of the enzyme require modification."

All three forms exhibited receptor-binding activity. Analysis of native alpha- and beta-EGF by mass spectrometry and partial Edman degradation led us to propose that alpha-EGF has a primary structure equivalent to that originally reported for EGF and that beta-EGF is the des-asparaginyl form of the polypeptide. When the purified alpha- and beta-polypeptides were cultured with human embryonic palatal mesenchymal cells stimulation of cell proliferation was observed at concentrations as low as 0.01 ng/ml with maximal stimulation occurring at about 1 ng/ml. Essentially no difference was noted in the mitogenic potency of the two forms. This suggests that the NH2-terminal region of EGF is not critical for mitogenic activity."
https://openalex.org/W153813555,"The degradation of the enkephalin-containing octapeptide Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Gly-Leu (YGGFMRGL) was systematically investigated by incubating the peptide with synaptic membranes from rat striatum or with purified peptidases. The degradation products were derivatized with 4-dimethylamino-azobenzene-4'-isothiocyanate and then analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography and by amino-terminal analysis. The incubation of YGGFMRGL with synaptic membranes yielded YGG, YGGF, YGGFM, and MR in a manner that was linear with respect to time. The corresponding carboxyl-terminal fragments FMRGL, MRGL, and RGL could not be detected, which suggests that the degradation of YGGFMRGL by synaptic membranes occurs by carboxypeptidase activity. The incubation of YGGFMRGL with different purified peptidases produced cleavage patterns unique from that seen with synaptic membranes. Enkephalinase recognized only the Gly-Phe bond to produce YGG and FMRGL. Thermolysin recognized the Gly-Phe bond and the Phe-Met bond to yield YGG, YGGF, FMRGL, and MRGL. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) produced primarily YGGF, MR, and lesser amounts of YGGFMR and YG. The formation of YGG, YGGF, and YGGFM by synaptic membranes could be stimulated 3-fold by the addition of 30 mM NaCl and inhibited by MK-422, an ACE inhibitor, with an IC50 of 3 nM. These data suggest that ACE, a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, is the primary enzyme involved in the degradation of YGGFMRGL in brain. ACE apparently works in concert with another carboxypeptidase in brain to yield YGGFM and YGG since the carboxyl-terminal peptides RGL and FMRGL could not be detected."
https://openalex.org/W1487082672,"Several recombinant clones isolated from a mouse genomic library were previously shown to hybridize with a SmaI fragment located in the terminal repetition of the S component of herpes simplex virus DNA. We report here the nucleotide sequence of the related regions in two mouse clones, TGL19 and TGL35, as well as that of the SmaI fragment of HSV-1. The mouse DNA clones have a core of repetitive sequences 80% homologous to a tandem repeat (reiteration II) in the viral fragment. The regions of homology are in turn related to immunoglobulin class-switch sequences, due mostly to the presence of the pentamer TGGG(G), involved in class-switch recombination. These results suggest that the HSV genome has recombination sequences identical to those of the host cell and provide a possible explanation for the high frequency of recombination events observed in this region of the viral genome."
https://openalex.org/W1670928875,"Phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) causes mRNA to accumulate in 48 S complexes containing Met-tRNAf and eIF-2(alpha P). When the eIF-2 alpha kinase is inhibited by 2-aminopurine, the mRNA is slowly transferred from 48 to 80 S initiation complexes after an initial lag. The cause of this lag was examined by investigating whether mRNA and Met-tRNAf dissociated from 48 S complexes before binding to 80 S. Both compounds were quantitatively transferred from 48 to 80 S complexes after addition of 2-aminopurine and the eIF-2(alpha P) bound to 48 S complexes was dephosphorylated after an initial lag more slowly than unbound eIF-2(alpha P), which was rapidly dephosphorylated. the eIF-2(alpha P) in isolated 48 S complexes was slowly dephosphorylated by partially purified lysate phosphatases, whereas free eIF-2(alpha P) was readily dephosphorylated. These results indicated that 48 S complexes could directly join to a 60 S ribosomal subunit after eIF-2(alpha P) dephosphorylation. The lag and slow kinetics of dephosphorylation of eIF-2(alpha P) bound to 48 S complexes accounted for the slow transfer of mRNA from 48 to 80 S complexes. Moreover, the mRNA bound to 48 S complexes was more susceptible to cleavage by an endonuclease than mRNA in polyribosomes, as shown by activating the (2'-5')oligo(A)-dependent endonuclease. This finding is discussed in view of the possible role of eIF-2 alpha kinase and endonuclease in the inhibition of viral mRNA translation in interferon-treated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1549801942,"1H and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance was used to investigate the interaction of AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) with bovine liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Mn2+ bound to fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was used as a paramagnetic probe to map the active and AMP allosteric sites of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Distances between enzyme-bound Mn2+ and the phosphorus atoms at C-6 of fructose-6-P and alpha-methyl-D-fructofuranoside 1,6-bisphosphate were identical, and the enzyme-Mn to phosphorus distance determined for the C-6 phosphorus atom of Fru-2,6-P2 was very similar to these values. Likewise, the enzyme-Mn to phosphorus distances for Pi, the C-1 phosphorus atom of alpha-methyl-D-fructofuranoside 1,6-bisphosphate, and the C-2 phosphorus atom of Fru-2,6-P2 agreed within 0.5 A. The distance between enzyme-bound Mn2+ and the phosphorus atom of AMP was significantly shorter than the distances obtained for any of the aforementioned ligands, but the presence of Fru-2,6-P2 caused the enzyme-Mn to phosphorus distance for AMP to lengthen markedly. NMR line broadening of AMP protons was studied at various temperatures. The dissociation rate constant was found to be greater than 20 s-1. It was concluded that Fru-2,6-P2 strongly affects the interaction of AMP with fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and that the sugar most likely acts at the active site of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1557879417,"Phosphate entry into chloride-loaded human erythrocytes is inhibited by treatment of cells with the water-soluble carbodiimide 1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl)carbodiimide (EAC) in the absence of added nucleophile. EAC does not penetrate the erythrocyte membrane or lead to significant intermolecular cross-linking of membrane proteins. At neutral extracellular pH in chloride-free medium, only about 50% of transport is rapidly and irreversibly inhibited, but at alkaline pH, inhibition is more rapid and complete. Inhibition by EAC was reversible in the presence of extracellular NaCl. Modification of membrane sulfhydryl groups does not prevent inhibition of phosphate transport by EAC but almost complete protection is afforded by 4,4-dinitrostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid, a reversible competitive inhibitor of anion transport. N-(4-Azido-2-nitrophenyl)-2-aminoethylsulfonate, a reversible noncompetitive inhibitor of anion transport did not protect against EAC inhibition of transport but prevented reversal of inhibition in saline medium. Transport inhibition by [3H]EAC did not lead to specific incorporation of radioactivity into Band 3, the anion transport protein. These results suggest that inhibition of anion transport by EAC is due to modification of a carboxylic acid residue in or near the transport site accessible from the external face of the membrane. The subsequent fate of the modified carboxyl residue appears to be sensitive to the orientation of the anion transport site."
https://openalex.org/W1527223066,"Potassium ferrate, an analog of orthophosphate and a potent oxidizing agent, was found to irreversibly inactivate porcine muscle adenylate kinase. Inhibition was prevented by competitive inhibitors or substrates, indicating that the action of ferrate was site-specific. Inactivation was accompanied by the loss of Cys-25 and Tyr-95. P1,P5-di(adenosine 5')-pentaphosphate (10(-7) M), a powerful competitive inhibitor, gave 50% protection to the enzyme from ferrate inactivation. No loss of tyrosine or cysteine residues was observed under conditions of total protection. The degree of inactivation was proportional to the amount of Tyr-95 destroyed. However, Cys-25 was totally oxidized when only 55% inactivation had occurred. Partially inactivated enzyme exhibited a Km for ATP and AMP similar to that of the untreated enzyme. It appears that Cys-25 may be proximate to a phosphate-binding site but is not directly involved in the catalytic reaction. The results suggest that Tyr-95 is located in the vicinity of a phosphate-binding region of adenylate kinase and is essential for enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W95961575,"N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) phosphatidylserine (NBD-PS), a fluorescent phospholipid synthesized from phosphatidylserine by reaction with NBD-chloride, caused platelet shape change and aggregation when added at micromolar concentrations to suspensions of washed human platelets in the absence of added fibrinogen. Platelet aggregation by NBD-PS was accompanied by thromboxane synthesis and secretion of contents from dense, alpha-, and lysosomal granules in the absence of appreciable platelet damage. Indomethacin completely inhibited NBD-PS-induced thromboxane synthesis, but platelet aggregation and [14C]serotonin secretion were only slightly inhibited. Neither inhibition of the ADP-dependent pathway with creatine phosphate/creatine kinase plus ATP, alone or in combination with indomethacin, nor maximum elevation of cyclic AMP by treatment with prostaglandin I2 and theophylline completely inhibited NBD-PS-induced platelet aggregation or [14C]serotonin secretion. Platelet effects of NBD-PS were specific in that neither phosphatidylserine nor lyso-NBD-PS were similarly active. The activation of platelets by NBD-PS is not attributable to the NBD moiety exclusively since acylation of the amino group with 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-chloride yielded a similarly active derivative. Dansylated phosphatidylethanolamine was also active. The findings indicate that NBD-PS and other N-substituted aminophospholipids can activate a central pathway of platelet secretion and aggregation that is independent of released ADP and thromboxane formation and is only partially controlled by platelet cyclic AMP."
