https://openalex.org/W3127277789,"SARS-CoV-2 can mutate and evade immunity, with consequences for efficacy of emerging vaccines and antibody therapeutics. Here, we demonstrate that the immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor binding motif (RBM) is a highly variable region of S and provide epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characterization of a prevalent, sentinel RBM mutation, N439K. We demonstrate N439K S protein has enhanced binding affinity to the hACE2 receptor, and N439K viruses have similar in vitro replication fitness and cause infections with similar clinical outcomes as compared to wild type. We show the N439K mutation confers resistance against several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, including one authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and reduces the activity of some polyclonal sera from persons recovered from infection. Immune evasion mutations that maintain virulence and fitness such as N439K can emerge within SARS-CoV-2 S, highlighting the need for ongoing molecular surveillance to guide development and usage of vaccines and therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3131923730,"Human stem-cell-derived models provide the promise of accelerating our understanding of brain disorders, but not knowing whether they possess the ability to mature beyond mid- to late-fetal stages potentially limits their utility. We leveraged a directed differentiation protocol to comprehensively assess maturation in vitro. Based on genome-wide analysis of the epigenetic clock and transcriptomics, as well as RNA editing, we observe that three-dimensional human cortical organoids reach postnatal stages between 250 and 300 days, a timeline paralleling in vivo development. We demonstrate the presence of several known developmental milestones, including switches in the histone deacetylase complex and NMDA receptor subunits, which we confirm at the protein and physiological levels. These results suggest that important components of an intrinsic in vivo developmental program persist in vitro. We further map neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease risk genes onto in vitro gene expression trajectories to provide a resource and webtool (Gene Expression in Cortical Organoids, GECO) to guide disease modeling. Gordon et al. use genome-wide unbiased approaches to show that human cerebral cortical organoids, when cultured for many months, start to resemble stages of postnatal brain development, with a timeline that parallels in vivo development."

The present study investigated the safety and mechanisms of action of Staphylococcus hominis A9 (ShA9), a bacterium isolated from healthy human skin, as a topical therapy for AD. ShA9 killed S. aureus on the skin of mice and inhibited expression of a toxin from S. aureus (psmα) that promotes inflammation. A first-in-human, phase 1, double-blinded, randomized 1-week trial of topical ShA9 or vehicle on the forearm skin of 54 adults with S. aureus-positive AD (NCT03151148) met its primary endpoint of safety, and participants receiving ShA9 had fewer adverse events associated with AD. Eczema severity was not significantly different when evaluated in all participants treated with ShA9 but a significant decrease in S. aureus and increased ShA9 DNA were seen and met secondary endpoints. Some S. aureus strains on participants were not directly killed by ShA9, but expression of mRNA for psmα was inhibited in all strains. Improvement in local eczema severity was suggested by post-hoc analysis of participants with S. aureus directly killed by ShA9. These observations demonstrate the safety and potential benefits of bacteriotherapy for AD."
https://openalex.org/W3132068389,"Some cancers originate from a single mutation event in a single cell. Blood cancers known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are thought to originate when a driver mutation is acquired by a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). However, when the mutation first occurs in individuals and how it affects the behavior of HSCs in their native context is not known. Here we quantified the effect of the JAK2-V617F mutation on the self-renewal and differentiation dynamics of HSCs in treatment-naive individuals with MPNs and reconstructed lineage histories of individual HSCs using somatic mutation patterns. We found that JAK2-V617F mutations occurred in a single HSC several decades before MPN diagnosis-at age 9 ± 2 years in a 34-year-old individual and at age 19 ± 3 years in a 63-year-old individual-and found that mutant HSCs have a selective advantage in both individuals. These results highlight the potential of harnessing somatic mutations to reconstruct cancer lineages."

https://openalex.org/W3133251387,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplastic plasma-cell disorder characterized by clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells. Despite extensive research, disease heterogeneity within and between treatment-resistant patients is poorly characterized. In the present study, we conduct a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial (NCT04065789), combined with longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study the molecular dynamics of MM resistance mechanisms. Newly diagnosed MM patients (41), who either failed to respond or experienced early relapse after a bortezomib-containing induction regimen, were enrolled to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a daratumumab, carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination. The primary clinical endpoint was safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival. Treatment was safe and well tolerated; deep and durable responses were achieved. In prespecified exploratory analyses, comparison of 41 primary refractory and early relapsed patients, with 11 healthy subjects and 15 newly diagnosed MM patients, revealed new MM molecular pathways of resistance, including hypoxia tolerance, protein folding and mitochondria respiration, which generalized to larger clinical cohorts (CoMMpass). We found peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), a central enzyme in the protein-folding response pathway, as a potential new target for resistant MM. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of PPIA or inhibition of PPIA with a small molecule inhibitor (ciclosporin) significantly sensitizes MM tumor cells to proteasome inhibitors. Together, our study defines a roadmap for integrating scRNA-seq in clinical trials, identifies a signature of highly resistant MM patients and discovers PPIA as a potent therapeutic target for these tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3130937819,"Molecular differences between individual cells can lead to dramatic differences in cell fate, such as death versus survival of cancer cells upon drug treatment. These originating differences remain largely hidden due to difficulties in determining precisely what variable molecular features lead to which cellular fates. Thus, we developed Rewind, a methodology that combines genetic barcoding with RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization to directly capture rare cells that give rise to cellular behaviors of interest. Applying Rewind to BRAFV600E melanoma, we trace drug-resistant cell fates back to single-cell gene expression differences in their drug-naive precursors (initial frequency of ~1:1,000-1:10,000 cells) and relative persistence of MAP kinase signaling soon after drug treatment. Within this rare subpopulation, we uncover a rich substructure in which molecular differences among several distinct subpopulations predict future differences in phenotypic behavior, such as proliferative capacity of distinct resistant clones after drug treatment. Our results reveal hidden, rare-cell variability that underlies a range of latent phenotypic outcomes upon drug exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3129874442,"Rapid execution of motor sequences is believed to depend on fusing movement elements into cohesive units that are executed holistically. We sought to determine the contribution of primary motor and dorsal premotor cortex to this ability. Monkeys performed highly practiced two-reach sequences, interleaved with matched reaches performed alone or separated by a delay. We partitioned neural population activity into components pertaining to preparation, initiation and execution. The hypothesis that movement elements fuse makes specific predictions regarding all three forms of activity. We observed none of these predicted effects. Rapid two-reach sequences involved the same set of neural events as individual reaches but with preparation for the second reach occurring as the first was in flight. Thus, at the level of dorsal premotor and primary motor cortex, skillfully executing a rapid sequence depends not on fusing elements, but on the ability to perform two key processes at the same time."

https://openalex.org/W3130260605,"Pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons fire together in balanced cortical networks. In contrast to this general rule, we describe a distinct neuron type in mice and rats whose spiking activity is anti-correlated with all principal cells and interneurons in all brain states but, most prevalently, during the down state of non-REM (NREM) sleep. We identify these down state-active (DSA) neurons as deep-layer neocortical neurogliaform cells that express ID2 and Nkx2.1 and are weakly immunoreactive to neuronal nitric oxide synthase. DSA neurons are weakly excited by deep-layer pyramidal cells and strongly inhibited by several other GABAergic cell types. Spiking of DSA neurons modified the sequential firing order of other neurons at down-up transitions. Optogenetic activation of ID2+Nkx2.1+ interneurons in the posterior parietal cortex during NREM sleep, but not during waking, interfered with consolidation of cue discrimination memory. Despite their sparsity, DSA neurons perform critical physiological functions."
https://openalex.org/W3096729878,"Malaria and iron deficiency (ID) are common and interrelated public health problems in African children. Observational data suggest that interrupting malaria transmission reduces the prevalence of ID1. To test the hypothesis that malaria might cause ID, we used sickle cell trait (HbAS, rs334 ), a genetic variant that confers specific protection against malaria2, as an instrumental variable in Mendelian randomization analyses. HbAS was associated with a 30% reduction in ID among children living in malaria-endemic countries in Africa (n = 7,453), but not among individuals living in malaria-free areas (n = 3,818). Genetically predicted malaria risk was associated with an odds ratio of 2.65 for ID per unit increase in the log incidence rate of malaria. This suggests that an intervention that halves the risk of malaria episodes would reduce the prevalence of ID in African children by 49%. A genetic link suggests that interventions that halve the risk of malaria episodes could reduce the prevalence of iron deficiency in African children by nearly 50%."
https://openalex.org/W3129287485,"Background Sensitive and high throughput molecular detection assays are essential during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The vast majority of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays use nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) or oropharyngeal swab (OPS) specimens collected from suspected individuals. However, using NPS or OPS as specimens has apparent drawbacks, e.g. the collection procedures for NPS or OPS specimens can be uncomfortable to some people and may cause sneezing and coughing which in turn generate droplets and/or aerosol particles that are of risk to healthcare workers, requiring heavy use of personal protective equipment. There have been recent studies indicating that self-collected saliva specimens can be used for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 and provides more comfort and ease of use for the patients. Here we report the performance of QuantiVirus ™ SARS-CoV-2 test using saliva as the testing specimens with or without pooling. Methods Development and validation studies were conducted following FDA-EUA and molecular assay validation guidelines. Using SeraCare Accuplex SARS-CoV-2 reference panel, the limit of detection (LOD) and clinical performance studies were performed with the QuantiVirus ™ SARS-CoV-2 test. For clinical evaluation, 85 known positive and 90 known negative clinical NPS samples were tested. Additionally, twenty paired NPS and saliva samples collected from recovering COVID-19 patients were tested and the results were further compared to that of the Abbott m2000 SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay. Results of community collected 389 saliva samples for COVID-19 screening by QuantiVirus ™ SARS-CoV-2 test were also obtained and analyzed. Additionally, testing of pooled saliva samples was evaluated. Results The LOD for the QuantiVirus ™ SARS-CoV-2 test was confirmed to be 100–200 copies/mL. The clinical performance studies using contrived saliva samples indicated that the positive percentage agreement (PPA) of the QuantiVirus ™ SARS-CoV-2 test is 100% at 1xLOD, 1.5xLOD and 2.5xLOD. No cross-reactivity was observed for the QuantiVirus ™ SARS-CoV-2 test with common respiratory pathogens. Testing of clinical samples showed a positive percentage agreement (PPA) of 100% (95% CI: 94.6% to 100%) and a negative percentage agreement (NPA) of 98.9% (95% CI: 93.1% to 99.9%). QuantiVirus ™ SARS CoV-2 test had 80% concordance rate and no significant difference ( p = 0.13) between paired saliva and NPS specimens by Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. Positive test rate was 1.79% for 389 saliva specimens collected from local communities for COVID-19 screening. Preliminary data showed that saliva sample pooling up to 6 samples (1:6 pooling) for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible (sensitivity 94.8% and specificity 100%). Conclusion The studies demonstrated that the QuantiVirus ™ SARS-CoV-2 test has a LOD of 200 copies/mL in contrived saliva samples. The clinical performance of saliva-based testing is comparable to that of NPS-based testing. Pooling of saliva specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible. Saliva based and high-throughput QuantiVirus ™ SARS-CoV-2 test offers a highly desirable testing platform during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3133182606,"Introduction Medical personnel is an occupational group that is especially prone to secondary traumatic stress. The factors conditioning its occurrence include organizational and work-related factors, as well as personal features and traits. The aim of this study was to determine Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS) indicators in a group of medical personnel, considering occupational load, job satisfaction, social support, and cognitive processing of trauma. Material and methods Results obtained from 419 medical professionals, paramedics and nurses, were analyzed. The age of study participants ranged from 19 to 65 ( M = 39.60, SD = 11.03). A questionnaire developed for this research including questions about occupational indicators as well as four standard evaluation tools: Secondary Traumatic Stress Inventory, Job Satisfaction Scale, Social Support Scale which measures four support sources (supervisors, coworkers, family, friends) and Cognitive Processing of Trauma Scale which allows to evaluate cognitive coping strategies (positive cognitive restructuring, downward comparison, resolution/acceptance, denial, regret) were used in the study. Results The results showed that the main predictor of STS symptoms in the studied group of medical personnel is job satisfaction. Two cognitive strategies also turned out to be predictors of STS, that is regret (positive relation) and resolution/acceptance (negative relation). The contribution of other analyzed variables, i.e., denial, workload and social support to explaining the dependent variable is rather small. Conclusions Paramedics and nurses are at the high risk of indirect traumatic exposure and thus may be more prone to secondary traumatic stress symptoms development. It is important to include the medical personnel in the actions aiming at prevention and reduction of STS symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3133427213,"Nutrient addition to forest ecosystems significantly influences belowground microbial diversity, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. Nitrogen (N) addition in forests is common in China, especially in the southeast region. However, the influence of N addition on belowground soil microbial community diversity in subtropical forests remains unclear. In May 2018, we randomly selected 12 experimental plots in a Pinus taiwanensis forest within the Daiyun Mountain Nature Reserve, Fujian Province, China, and subjected them to N addition treatments for one year. We investigated the responses of the soil microbial communities and identified the major elements that influenced microbial community composition in the experimental plots. The present study included three N treatments, i.e., the control (CT), low N addition (LN, 40 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ), and high N addition (HN, 80 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ), and two depths, 0−10 cm (topsoil) and 10−20 cm (subsoil), which were all sampled in the growing season (May) of 2019. Soil microbial diversity and community composition in the topsoil and subsoil were investigated using high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rDNA genes and fungal internal transcribed spacer sequences. According to our results, 1) soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) significantly decreased after HN addition, and available nitrogen (AN) significantly declined after LN addition, 2) bacterial α-diversity in the subsoil significantly decreased with HN addition, which was affected significantly by the interaction between N addition and soil layer, and 3) soil DOC, rather than pH, was the dominant environmental factor influencing soil bacterial community composition, while AN and MBN were the best predictors of soil fungal community structure dynamics. Moreover, N addition influence both diversity and community composition of soil bacteria more than those of fungi in the subtropical forests. The results of the present study provide further evidence to support shifts in soil microbial community structure in acidic subtropical forests in response to increasing N deposition."
https://openalex.org/W3131123731,"Academic journals provide a key quality-control mechanism in science. Yet, information asymmetries and conflicts of interests incentivize scientists to deceive journals about the quality of their research. How can honesty be ensured, despite incentives for deception? Here, we address this question by applying the theory of honest signaling to the publication process. Our models demonstrate that several mechanisms can ensure honest journal submission, including differential benefits, differential costs, and costs to resubmitting rejected papers. Without submission costs, scientists benefit from submitting all papers to high-ranking journals, unless papers can only be submitted a limited number of times. Counterintuitively, our analysis implies that inefficiencies in academic publishing (e.g., arbitrary formatting requirements, long review times) can serve a function by disincentivizing scientists from submitting low-quality work to high-ranking journals. Our models provide simple, powerful tools for understanding how to promote honest paper submission in academic publishing."
https://openalex.org/W3131780186,"Diseases caused by myxozoan parasites represent a significant threat to the health of salmonids in both the wild and aquaculture setting, and there are no effective therapeutants for their control. The myxozoan Ceratonova shasta is an intestinal parasite of salmonids that causes severe enteronecrosis and mortality. Most fish populations appear genetically fixed as resistant or susceptible to the parasite, offering an attractive model system for studying the immune response to myxozoans. We hypothesized that early recognition of the parasite is a critical factor driving resistance and that susceptible fish would have a delayed immune response. RNA-seq was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed in the gills and intestine during the early stages of C . shasta infection in both resistant and susceptible steelhead ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ). This revealed a downregulation of genes involved in the IFN-γ signaling pathway in the gills of both phenotypes. Despite this, resistant fish quickly contained the infection and several immune genes, including two innate immune receptors were upregulated. Susceptible fish, on the other hand, failed to control parasite proliferation and had no discernible immune response to the parasite, including a near-complete lack of differential gene expression in the intestine. Further sequencing of intestinal samples from susceptible fish during the middle and late stages of infection showed a vigorous yet ineffective immune response driven by IFN-γ, and massive differential expression of genes involved in cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix, which coincided with the breakdown of the intestinal structure. Our results suggest that the parasite may be suppressing the host’s immune system during the initial invasion, and that susceptible fish are unable to recognize the parasite invading the intestine or mount an effective immune response. These findings improve our understanding of myxozoan-host interactions while providing a set of putative resistance markers for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3131174462,"Introduction Approximately 1.4 million transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adults in the United States have unique health and health care needs, including anatomy-driven cancer screening. This study explored the general healthcare experiences of TGD people in the Washington, DC area, and cancer screening experiences in particular. Methods Twenty-one TGD people were recruited through word of mouth and Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer (LGBTQ)-specific community events. Participant interviews were conducted and recorded via WebEx (n = 20; one interview failed to record). Interviews were transcribed using Rev.com . Two coders conducted line-by-line coding for emergent themes in NVivo 12, developed a codebook by consensus, and refined the codebook throughout the coding process. Member checking was conducted to ensure credibility of findings. Results Three major themes served as parent nodes: health-care seeking behaviors, quality care, and TGD-specific health care experiences. Within these parent nodes there were 14 child nodes and 4 grand-child nodes. Subthemes for health care seeking behaviors included coverage and costs of care, convenience, trust/mistrust of provider, and provider recommendations for screening. Subthemes for quality of care included professionalism, clinical competence in transgender care, care coordination, provider communication, and patient self-advocacy. Overall, transgender men were less satisfied with care than transgender women. Conclusions Results suggest a need for improved provider communication skills, including clear explanations of procedures and recommendations for appropriate screenings to TGD patients. Results also suggest a need for improved clinical knowledge and cultural competency. Respondents also wanted better care coordination and insurance navigation. Overall, these findings can inform health care improvements for TGD people."
https://openalex.org/W3131160753,"In some types of meditation, such as mindfulness and Zen, breathing is the focus of attention, whereas during an excessive, short-period of anaerobic exercise, the muscles become the focus of attention. Thus, during both efforts, one’s attention is focused on a certain feature of the body. Both meditation and exercise generally provide mental refreshment to humans. We hypothesized that the same brain regions are activated by both efforts in humans. To examine this hypothesis, we engaged participants in 3 tasks: meditation, exercise, and a control task. After each task, the participants underwent a 2-back test to concentrate their thoughts, while changes in their blood hemoglobin levels were simultaneously monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Seventeen participants (20–24 years of age; 11 men, 6 women) were enrolled. We applied a fast-Fourier transform (FFT) analysis to the NIRS wave data and calculated the correlation coefficients of the FFT data between (1) meditation and control, (2) exercise and control, and (3) meditation and exercise, at the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), brain areas that are generally involved in mental refreshment. A significant difference in the correlation coefficients between the OFC and DLPFC was detected in the meditation and exercise analysis, and signal source analysis confirmed that the NIRS waves spread from the right and left OFC edges (i.e., right and left temples) toward the center. Our results suggest that both meditation and exercise activate the OFC, which is involved in emotional reactions and motivation behavior, resulting in mental refreshment."

https://openalex.org/W3132572774,"Spread of genetically diverse Staphylococcus aureus characterized with multi-antibiotic resistance and regulated by high level agr functionalities in several communities in southwest Nigeria was investigated and evaluated for infection control. Staphylococcus aureus pathotypes recovered from 256 cases including purulent pus from skin infections, soft tissue aspirates, wounds, otorrhea, eye, throat and endocervical infections were assayed for biofilm and antibiogram. Further genotyped with micro-array, mapped for geospatial distribution and evaluated for clonal diversity and functional accessory gene regulators ( agr ). Significant Staphylococci infection among the ages (OR:0.021, CI:0.545–1.914) and female gender with prevalence rate of MSSA (53.0%) and MRSA (1.5%) (OR:1.021, CI:0.374–1.785) were observed. More than 52.5% resistance rates to tetracycline and amoxicillin with significant median resistance were observed in all the infection cases (p = 0.001). Resistance rate of 78.8% at MIC 50 32μg/ml and MIC 90 128μg/ml to amoxicillin-clavulanate, and more than 40% resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline of MIC 90 and MIC 50 at 32 μg/ml were observed. Strains with multi-antibiotic resistance index above 0.83, high beta-lactamase and strong biofilm clustered into separate phylo-group. Heterogeneous t442 (wound and pus), t657 (wound), t091 (ear) and t657 (ear and wound) revealed high phylogenetic diversity. Only 4.6% pvl + MSSA-CC1 agr I, pvl + MSSA-CC5 (13.6%) and pvl + MRSA-CC7 agr II (4.6%), expressed enterotoxin, leukocidins, proteases and resistance gene determinants. Livestock clonal types clustered with identified community-associated strains. Clonal dissemination of resistant pvl+ MSSA-CC1 and MRSA-CC5 encoding agr were predominant in several peri-urban communities where adequate geno-surveillance, population-target antimicrobial stewardship, extensive community structured infection control programs are needed to prevent further focal dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W3132594574,"The demand for food will outpace productivity of conventional agriculture due to projected growth of the human population, concomitant with shrinkage of arable land, increasing scarcity of freshwater, and a rapidly changing climate. While aquaponics has potential to sustainably supplement food production with minimal environmental impact, there is a need to better characterize the complex interplay between the various components (fish, plant, microbiome) of these systems to optimize scale up and productivity. Here, we investigated how the commonly-implemented practice of continued microbial community transfer from pre-existing systems might promote or impede productivity of aquaponics. Specifically, we monitored plant growth phenotypes, water chemistry, and microbiome composition of rhizospheres, biofilters, and fish feces over 61-days of lettuce ( Lactuca sativa var . crispa) growth in nitrogen-limited aquaponic systems inoculated with bacteria that were either commercially sourced or originating from a pre-existing aquaponic system. Lettuce above- and below-ground growth were significantly reduced across replicates treated with a pre-existing aquaponic system inoculum when compared to replicates treated with a commercial inoculum. Reduced productivity was associated with enrichment in specific bacterial genera in plant roots, including Pseudomonas , following inoculum transfer from pre-existing systems. Increased productivity was associated with enrichment of nitrogen-fixing Rahnella in roots of plants treated with the commercial inoculum. Thus, we show that inoculation from a pre-existing system, rather than from a commercial inoculum, is associated with lower yields. Further work will be necessary to test the putative mechanisms involved."

We evaluated the clinical and hemodynamic characteristics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated PH.We performed a retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of HIV undergoing right heart catheterization (RHC) from 2000-2016 in a tertiary care center. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of HIV, age ≥ 18 years and availability of RHC data. PH was classified as either pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; mean pulmonary arterial pressure [mPAP] ≥ 25mmHg with pulmonary artery wedge pressure [PAWP] ≤ 15mmHg) or pulmonary venous hypertension (PVH; mPAP ≥ 25mmHg with PAWP > 15). We collected demographics, CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, RHC and echocardiographic data. The single beat method was used to calculate RV-PA coupling from RHC.Sixty-two PLWH with a clinical likelihood for PH underwent RHC. Thirty-two (52%) met PH criteria (15 with PAH, 17 with PVH). Average time from diagnosis of HIV to diagnosis of PH was 11 years. Eleven of 15 individuals with PAH were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) while all 17 patients with PVH were on ART. Compared to PLWH without PH, those with PH had an increased likelihood of having a detectable HIV viral load and lower CD4 cell counts. PLWH with PAH or PVH had increased RV afterload with normal RV contractility, and preserved RV-PA coupling.PLWH with PH (PAH or PVH) were more likely to have a detectable HIV viral load and lower CD4 count at the time of RHC. PLWH with PAH or PVH had increased RV afterload, normal RV contractility, with preserved RV-PA coupling suggestive of an early onset, mild, and compensated form of PH. These results should be confirmed in larger studies."
https://openalex.org/W3130575704,"Pseudouridine(Ψ) is widely popular among various RNA modifications which have been confirmed to occur in rRNA, mRNA, tRNA, and nuclear/nucleolar RNA. Hence, identifying them has vital significance in academic research, drug development and gene therapies. Several laboratory techniques for Ψ identification have been introduced over the years. Although these techniques produce satisfactory results, they are costly, time-consuming and requires skilled experience. As the lengths of RNA sequences are getting longer day by day, an efficient method for identifying pseudouridine sites using computational approaches is very important. In this paper, we proposed a multi-channel convolution neural network using binary encoding. We employed k-fold cross-validation and grid search to tune the hyperparameters. We evaluated its performance in the independent datasets and found promising results. The results proved that our method can be used to identify pseudouridine sites for associated purposes.

A spatial suitability evaluation system for mountain-based adventure tourism (MBAT) was developed via the integration of the AHP-Delphi technique. The evaluation system parameters included resource conditions, difficulty levels, safety conditions, and ecological sensitivity. Furthermore, each parameter contained several indicators that can be quantified and visualised in ArcGIS. The results showed that suitable areas for professional adventure tourism in Xinjiang Tianshan include the Kurdening and Tomur regions, and the those for adventure tourism include the Tianshan Tianchi lake. Furthermore, suitable areas for experiential adventure tourism include the Tianshan Tianchi lake, Tianshan Grand Canyon, Jiangbulak, East Tianshan, Tuohurasu scenic area, and the Gongliu wild fruit forest, while those for mass adventure tourism include large areas in the middle and low altitude range of Tianshan. The methods and results proposed in this paper are expected to be significant for planning adventure tourism and can be helpful for mountain communities when choosing regions to develop for adventure tourism, formulating tourism development strategies, increasing tourism opportunities, and thus improving regional competitiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3133051956,"The TIFY gene family is a plant-specific gene family encoding a group of proteins characterized by its namesake, the conservative TIFY domain and members can be organized into four subfamilies: ZML, TIFY, PPD and JAZ (Jasmonate ZIM-domain protein) by presence of additional conserved domains. The TIFY gene family is intensively explored in several model and agriculturally important crop species and here, yet the composition of the TIFY family of maize has remained unresolved. This study increases the number of maize TIFY family members known by 40%, bringing the total to 47 including 38 JAZ , 5 TIFY , and 4 ZML genes. The majority of the newly identified genes were belonging to the JAZ subfamily, six of which had aberrant TIFY domains, suggesting loss JAZ-JAZ or JAZ-NINJA interactions. Six JAZ genes were found to have truncated Jas domain or an altered degron motif, suggesting resistance to classical JAZ degradation. In addition, seven membranes were found to have an LxLxL-type EAR motif which allows them to recruit TPL/TPP co-repressors directly without association to NINJA. Expression analysis revealed that ZmJAZ14 was specifically expressed in the seeds and ZmJAZ19 and 22 in the anthers, while the majority of other ZmJAZs were generally highly expressed across diverse tissue types. Additionally, ZmJAZ genes were highly responsive to wounding and JA treatment. This study provides a comprehensive update of the maize TIFY/JAZ gene family paving the way for functional, physiological, and ecological analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3133121477,"Aim of the work This study aimed at assessing the dominance of risk practices associated with HCV endemicity in Egypt and detecting the behavioral development level concerning different aspects of HCV risk behaviors with respect to age and gender. The survey highlights the most cost-effective strategies that could accelerate HCV elimination in Egypt. Subjects and methods A national household survey targeted 3780 individuals (age range: 10–85 years). The sample was a systematic probability proportionate to size from 6 governorates representing the six major subdivisions of Egypt. The indicators used for assessing the behavioral development level towards HCV included six domains: awareness (7 indicators), perceived risk (5 indicators), motivation with the intention to change (4 and 5 indicators for males and females respectively), trial, rejection or adoption (6 and 5 indicators for males and females respectively). Results The study revealed that along the continuum of behavior development, the percentage of the participants who acquired half of the scores was as follows: 73.1% aware, 69.8% developed perceived risk, 80.6% motivated with only 28.9% adopting the recommended behaviors, 32% rejected them, 2.3% were in the trial stage versus 35.8% who did not try any. Adolescents had significantly lower levels of development for almost all domains when compared to adults. Statistical higher significance was detected in favor of adults, employees, married, Lower Egypt governorates, and university-educated participants (p&lt;0.001) regarding awareness, perceived risk, and motivation scores. More than half of the participants incorrectly believed that contaminated food, sharing food utilities, contaminated water, mosquitoes, and schistosomiasis would lead to HCV transmission. Conclusion Egypt would be closer to HCV elimination when cost-effective strategies are directed not towards creating awareness, perceived risk or motivation to change- (at an acceptable level)- but towards motivating adopting risk-reduction behaviors for HCV, tackling misconceptions and reinforcement of social support."
https://openalex.org/W3127591480,"Wikipedia’s significant gender bias is widely acknowledged. In this paper we analyze the Spanish Wikipedia with the aim of estimating the percentage of women editors and measuring their engagement and editing practices with respect to their men counterparts. To identify the gender of Wikipedia registered users, we analyzed both the information contained in their user profile and the information provided by users about themselves on their personal user pages. Using our own coding procedure, it is possible to identify a greater number of women than by relying only on the gender reported in their user profile. Combining both methods, our results show that the percentage of women is small, a meagre 11.6% of all analyzed editors, though there is still a significant percentage of users whose gender cannot be determined by either method. Men outnumber women in all Wikipedia namespaces in a ratio that is always equal to or greater than 3:1. This fact can be partially explained by the lesser persistence of women editors, who tend to leave Wikipedia much more quickly. There is, however, a small group of veteran women editors who, in some cases, surpass men editors in terms of their editing practices and participation in different Wikipedia namespaces."
https://openalex.org/W3130646206,"Background The aim of this secondary analysis of the TESEO cohort is to identify, early in the course of treatment with tocilizumab, factors associated with the risk of progressing to mechanical ventilation and death and develop a risk score to estimate the risk of this outcome according to patients’ profile. Methods Patients with COVID-19 severe pneumonia receiving standard of care + tocilizumab who were alive and free from mechanical ventilation at day 6 after treatment initiation were included in this retrospective, multicenter cohort study. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to identify predictors of mechanical ventilation or death by day-28 from treatment initiation and β-coefficients were used to develop a risk score. Secondary outcome was mortality. Patients with the same inclusion criteria as the derivation cohort from 3 independent hospitals were used as validation cohort. Results 266 patients treated with tocilizumab were included. By day 28 of hospital follow-up post treatment initiation, 40 (15%) underwent mechanical ventilation or died [26 (10%)]. At multivariable analysis, sex, day-4 PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, platelets and CRP were independently associated with the risk of developing the study outcomes and were used to generate the proposed risk score. The accuracy of the score in AUC was 0.80 and 0.70 in internal validation and test for the composite endpoint and 0.92 and 0.69 for death, respectively. Conclusions Our score could assist clinicians in identifying, early after tocilizumab administration, patients who are likely to progress to mechanical ventilation or death, so that they could be selected for eventual rescue therapies."

https://openalex.org/W3129690878,"Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread across the world. The aim of our study was to characterize mild courses and to determine the antibody status for these patients. Methods We initiated an appeal for convalescent plasma donations. 615 people contacted us, and we ultimately included 426 in our analyses, in whom it was possible to assume COVID-19 based on detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies or virus detection during the disease using RT-PCR. Results The median duration of the disease was 12 days and the most common symptoms were fatigue, cough and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was detected in 82.4% of the persons and IgA antibodies were found in 73.9%. In 10.8%, no antibodies were detectable despite a positive RT-PCR result during the disease. Nevertheless, of 24 persons with asymptomatic courses of COVID-19, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in 23 (96%). Furthermore, there was a correlation between the duration of the disease and the detection of IgG antibodies. In addition, a correlation between the determined IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies was shown. Conclusion In this study, we were able to describe mild COVID-19 courses and determine antibody statuses for them. It could be shown that, despite SARS-CoV-2 detection during the disease, not all individuals developed antibodies or their level of antibodies had dropped below the detection limit shortly after the end of the disease. The extent to which immunity to re-infection is given in persons with undetectable antibodies (IgG, IgA) needs to be investigated in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3129923581,"Lycium ruthenicum is an excellent eco-economic shrub. Numerous researches have been conducted for the function of its fruits but scarcely focused on the somaclonal variation and DNA methylation. An efficient micropropagation protocol from leaves and stems of L . ruthenicum was developed in this study, in which not only the leaf explants but also the stem explants of L . ruthenicum were dedifferentiated and produced adventitious buds/multiple shoots on one type of medium. Notably, the efficient indirect organogenesis of stem explants was independent of exogenous auxin, which is contrary to the common conclusion that induction and proliferation of calli is dependent on exogenous auxin. We proposed that sucrose supply might be the crucial regulator of stem callus induction and proliferation of L . ruthenicum . Furthermore, results of methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) showed that DNA methylation somaclonal variation (MSV) of CNG decreased but that of CG increased after acclimatization. Three types of micropropagated plants (from leaf calli, stem calli and axillary buds) were epigenetically diverged more from each other after acclimatization and the ex vitro micropropagated plants should be selected to determine the fidelity. In summary, plants micropropagated from axillary buds and leaves of L . ruthenicum was more fidelity and might be suitable for preservation and propagation of elite germplasm. Also, leaf explants should be used in transformation. Meanwhile, plants from stem calli showed the highest MSV and might be used in somaclonal variation breeding. Moreover, one MSV hotspot was found based on biological replicates. The study not only provided foundations for molecular breeding, somaclonal variation breeding, preservation and propagation of elite germplasm, but also offered clues for further revealing novel mechanisms of both stem-explant dedifferentiation and MSV of L . ruthenicum ."
https://openalex.org/W3130105959,"Background Mobile or seasonal migrant workers are at increased risk for acquiring malaria infections and can be the primary source of malaria reintroduction into receptive areas. The aim of this formative assessment was to describe access to malaria prevention and control interventions among seasonal migrant or mobile workers in seven regional states of Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional formative assessment was conducted using a qualitative and quantitative mixed-method design, between October 2015 and October 2016. Quantitative data were collected from organizations that employ seasonal migrant workers and were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and ArcGIS 10.8 (Geo-spatial data). Qualitative data were collected using in-depth interview from 23 key informants (7 seasonal migrant workers, and 16 experts and managers of development projects who had hired seasonal migrant workers), which were recorded, transcribed, translated, coded, and thematically analyzed. Results There were 1,017,888 seasonal migrant workers employed in different developmental organizations including large-scale crop cultivating farms, sugar cane plantations, horticulture, road and house construction work, and gold mining and panning. Seasonal migrant workers’ housing facilities were poorly structured and overcrowded (30 people living per 64 square meter room) limiting the use of indoor residual spraying (IRS), and forcing seasonal migrant workers not to use long lasting insecticidal treated nets (LLINs). Seasonal migrant workers are engaged in nighttime activities when employment includes watering farmlands, harvesting sesame, and transporting sugar cane from the field to factories. Despite such high-risk living conditions, access and utilization of preventive and curative services by the seasonal workers were limited. Informal migrant worker employment systems by development organizations and inadequate technical and financial support coupled with poor supply chain management limited the planning and delivery of malaria prevention and treatment strategies targeting seasonal migrant workers. Conclusions Seasonal migrant workers in seven regions of Ethiopia were at substantial risk of acquiring malaria. Existing malaria prevention, control and management interventions were inadequate. This will contribute to the resurgence of outbreaks of malaria in areas where transmission has been lowered. A coordinated action is needed among all stakeholders to identify the size of seasonal migrant workers and develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to address their healthcare needs."
https://openalex.org/W3129456655,"Objective The current study investigated the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of berberine in the vasculature in hypertension. Methods Angiotensin II (Ang II)-loaded osmotic pumps were implanted in C57BL/6J mice with or without berberine administration. Mouse aortae were suspended in myograph for force measurement. Microarray technology were performed to analyze expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in the aortae. These dysregulated expressions were then validated by qRT-PCR. LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed to reveal the specific relationships. Results Ang Ⅱ resulted in a significant increase in the blood pressure of mice, which was suppressed by berberine. The impaired endothelium-dependent aortic relaxation was restored in hypertensive mice. Microarray data revealed that 578 lncRNAs and 554 mRNAs were up-regulated, while 320 lncRNAs and 377 mRNAs were down-regulated in the aortae by Ang Ⅱ; both were reversed by berberine treatment. qRT-PCR validation results of differentially expressed genes (14 lncRNAs and 6 mRNAs) were completely consistent with the microarray data. GO analysis showed that these verified differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in terms of “cellular process”, “biological regulation” and “regulation of biological process”, whilst KEGG analysis identified vascular function-related pathways including cAMP signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and calcium signaling pathway etc. Importantly, we observed that lncRNA ENSMUST00000144849, ENSMUST00000155383, and AK041185 were majorly expressed in endothelial cells. Conclusion The present results suggest that the five lncRNAs ENSMUST00000144849, NR_028422, ENSMUST00000155383, AK041185, and uc.335+ might serve critical regulatory roles in hypertensive vasculature by targeting pivotal mRNAs and subsequently affecting vascular function-related pathways. Moreover, these lncRNAs were modulated by berberine, therefore providing the novel potential therapeutic targets of berberine in hypertension. Furthermore, lncRNA ENSMUST00000144849, ENSMUST00000155383, and AK041185 might be involved in the preservation of vascular endothelial cell function."
https://openalex.org/W3130261000,"Background Epilepsy is thought to be caused by witchcraft, evil spirit, and God’s punishment for sins in many developing countries. As a result, people with epilepsy and their families usually suffer from stigma, discrimination, depression, and other psychiatric problems. Thus, this study aimed to assess the quality of life and its associated factors among epileptic patients attending public hospitals in North Wollo Zone, Northeast Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed in this study. A simple random sampling technique was utilized. Health-related quality of life was measured based on the total score of the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31) instrument. Data were entered into Epi-data 3.1 statistical package and exported to SPSS Version 20 for further analysis. Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between quality of life and the independent variables. Statistically significant values were declared at a P-value of &lt; 0.05. Results A total of 395 patients participated in the study making the response rate 98.5%. The mean age of the participants was 32.39 ±10.71 years. More than half, 199 (50.4%) of epileptic patients had an overall weighted average health related quality of life score of mean and above. Male sex (B = 4.34, 95%CI, 0.41, 8.27, P = 0.03), higher educational status (B = 7.18, 95%CI, 1.39, 13.00, P = 0.015) and age at onset of epilepsy (B = 0.237, 95%CI, 0.02, 0.45, P = 0.035) were associated with increased health related quality of life score. On the other hand, family history of epilepsy (B = -4.78, 95%CI,-9.24,-0.33, P = 0.035), uncontrolled seizure (B = -11.08, 95%CI,-15.11,-7.05, P &lt; 0.001), more than 5 pre-treatment number of seizures (B = -4.86, 95%CI,-8.91,-0.81, P = 0.019), poor drug adherence (B = -11.65, 95%CI,-16.06,-7.23, P &lt; 0.001), having moderate (B = -4.526, 95%CI,-8.59,-0.46, P = 0.029) to sever (B = -12.84, 95%CI,-18.30,-7.37, P &lt; 0.001) anxiety and depression, believing that epilepsy is caused by evil spirit (B = -7.04, 95%CI,-11.46,-2.61, P = 0.002), drinking alcohol (B = -5.42, 95%CI,-10.72,-0.13, P = 0.045), and having other co-morbidities (B = -9.35, 95%CI,-14.35,-4.36, P &lt; 0.001) were significantly negatively associated with the health related quality of life score among epileptic patients. Conclusions Only around half of the epileptic patients have a good health-related quality of life. In addition, multiple variables including family history, uncontrolled seizure, and poor drug adherence were associated with quality of life among epileptic patients. Hence, targeting these variables in epilepsy management is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3130545709,"Ubiquitin specific peptidase 2 (USP2) is a deubiquitinating enzyme expressed almost ubiquitously in the body, including in multiple brain regions. We previously showed that mice lacking USP2 present altered locomotor activity rhythms and response of the clock to light. However, the possible implication of USP2 in regulating other behaviors has yet to be tested. To address this, we ran a battery of behavioral tests on Usp2 KO mice. Firstly, we confirmed our prior findings of increased daily activity and reduced activity fragmentation in Usp2 KO mice. Further, mice lacking USP2 showed impaired motor coordination and equilibrium, a decrease in anxiety-like behavior, a deficit in working memory and in sensorimotor gating. On the other hand, no effects of Usp2 gene deletion were found on spatial memory. Hence, our data uncover the implication of USP2 in different behaviors and expands the range of the known functions of this deubiquitinase."
https://openalex.org/W3130840779,"Background The aim of this study was to evaluate whether surgeons´ experience and perioperative single-shot antibiotic prophylaxis affect outcome of patients undergoing stapes surgery. Patients and methods We retrospectively evaluated audiological outcomes and postoperative complications of 538 consecutive patients who underwent stapes surgery at a single tertiary referral center between 1990 and 2017. Effects of different clinical variables, including single-shot antibiotic prophylaxis and surgeons’ experience on outcome were assessed. Results 538 patients underwent 667 stapedotomies and postoperative complication rate was 7.5% (n = 50). Air conduction and air-bone gap closure improved significantly after surgery (14.2 ± 14.8 dB, p = 0.001; 14.5 ± 12.8 dB, p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that 6 years or less of surgical experience was independently associated with a higher incidence of persisting or recurrent conductive hearing loss (p = 0.033, OR 5.13) but perioperative application of antibiotics had no significant effect on outcome. Conclusion First, clinical outcome regarding persisting or recurrent conductive hearing loss caused by incus necrosis and prosthesis luxation is linked to surgical performance. This underlines the need for a meticulous training and supervision of less experienced surgeons performing stapes surgery. Second, our results do not support the need for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in stapes surgery. Potential standard limitations of retrospective cohort studies (selection bias, confusion bias etc.) could play a role in interpreting our results. However, the probability for these limitations is minimized due to the large patient sample."
https://openalex.org/W3131429270,"Background Tobacco smoke exposure (TSE) places an economic toll on the U.S. healthcare system. There is a gap in the literature on pediatric emergency department (ED) and urgent care related healthcare costs and utilization specific to tobacco smoke-exposed patients. The objectives were to assess pediatric ED visits, urgent care visits and hospital admissions longitudinally, and baseline visit costs among tobacco smoke-exposed children (TSE group) relative to unexposed children (non-TSE group). Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective study using electronic medical records of 380 children ages 0–17 years in the TSE group compared to 1,140 in the non-TSE group propensity score matched via nearest neighbor search by child age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Linear and Poisson regression models were used. Overall, children had a mean of 0.19 (SE = 0.01) repeat visits within 30-days, and 0.69 (SE = 0.04) pediatric ED visits and 0.87 (SE = 0.03) urgent care visits over 12-months following their baseline visit. The percent of children with ≥ 1 urgent care visit was higher among the TSE group (52.4%) than the non-TSE group (45.1%, p = 0.01). Children in the TSE group ( M = $1,136.97, SE = 76.44) had higher baseline pediatric ED visit costs than the non-TSE group ( M = $1,018.96, SE = 125.51, p = 0.01). Overall, children had 0.08 (SE = 0.01) hospital admissions over 12-months, and the TSE group ( M = 0.12, SE = 0.02) had higher mean admissions than the non-TSE group ( M = 0.06, SE = 0.01, p = 0.02). The child TSE group was at 1.85 times increased risk of having hospital admissions (95% CI = 1.23, 2.79, p = 0.003) than the non-TSE group. Conclusions Tobacco smoke-exposed children had higher urgent care utilization and hospital admissions over 12-months, and higher pediatric ED costs at baseline. Pediatric ED visits, urgent care visits, and hospitalizations may be opportune times for initiating tobacco control interventions, which may result in reductions of preventable acute care visits."
https://openalex.org/W3129539041,"The water ecology of salt marshes plays a crucial role in climate regulation, industrial production, and flood control. Due to a poor understanding of water ecology and the extensive mining of salt resources, concerns are mounting about declining groundwater levels, shrinking salt marshes, and other problems associated with the simple yet extremely fragile water ecosystem of salt marshes in arid salt lake areas. This study assessed the ecological status of water resources in the downstream salt marsh area of West Taijinar Lake in the Qaidam Basin, China (2010–2018). Using data from a field investigation, the water ecosystem was divided into an ecological pressure subsystem, an environmental quality subsystem, and a socio-economic subsystem according to an analytic hierarchy process. Each subsystem was quantitatively assessed using the ecological footprint model, the single-factor index, and available data for the salt marsh area. The results showed that water resources were always in a surplus state during the study period, whose development and utilization had a safe status. Surface water had low plankton diversity with no evidence of eutrophication, but its Cl - and SO 4 2- concentrations were too high for direct industrial water uses. Groundwater quality was classified into class V because of high salt concentrations, which could be considered for industrial use given the demand of industrial production. The socio-economic efficiency of water resources was high, as distinguished by decreased water consumption per 10,000 yuan GDP and excellent flood resistance. In conclusion, the ecological status of water resources was deemed good in the study area and this could help sustain regional development. However, since the water ecology in this area is mainly controlled by annual precipitation, it would be challenging to deal with the uneven distribution of precipitation and flood events and to make full use of them for groundwater recharge. This study provides insight into the impact of salt lake resource exploration on water ecology, and the results can be useful for the rational utilization of water resources in salt marshes in other arid areas."
https://openalex.org/W3130076944,"After an earthquake, affected areas have insufficient medicinal supplies, thereby necessitating substantial distribution of first-aid medicine from other supply centers. To make a proper distribution schedule, we considered the timing of supply and demand. In the present study, a “sequential time window” is used to describe the time to generate of supply and demand and the time of supply delivery. Then, considering the sequential time window, we proposed two multiobjective scheduling models with the consideration of demand uncertainty; two multiobjective stochastic programming models were also proposed to solve the scheduling models. Moreover, this paper describes a simulation that was performed based on a first-aid medicine distribution problem during a Wenchuan earthquake response. The simulation results show that the methodologies proposed in this paper provide effective schedules for the distribution of first-aid medicine. The developed distribution schedule enables some supplies in the former time windows to be used in latter time windows. This schedule increases the utility of limited stocks and avoids the risk that all the supplies are used in the short-term, leaving no supplies for long-term use."
https://openalex.org/W3130694190,"There is no gold standard indicator that is currently used to predict posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). A novel indicator of liver function, the LU15 index of 99m Tc-galactosyl serum albumin (GSA) scintigraphy, refers to the liver uptake ratio over a 15-min interval. We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the future liver remnant (FLR)-LU15 in predicting PHLF. The clinical data of 102 patients (70 males and 32 females; median age, 70 years) who underwent liver resection between January 2011 and August 2019 were analyzed. The FLR-LU15 was calculated by a fusion of simulated 3-dimensional images and 99m Tc-GSA scintigraphy. PHLF was determined according to the definition of the International Study Group of Liver Surgery. The FLR-LU15 was an independent risk factor for PHLF ≥ Grade B according to multivariate analysis, and its value correlated with the PHLF grade. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the FLR-LU15 for PHLF ≥ Grade B was 0.816 (95% confidence interval, 0.704–0.929), which was better than that of other indicators. When the cut-off value of FLR-LU15 was set at 16.7, the sensitivity was 86.7%, specificity was 74.7%, and odds ratio was 19.2 (95% confidence interval, 4.0–90.9), all of which were superior to other indicators. If the cut-off value was 13, the positive predictive value was 57.1%. The FLR-LU15 is a useful predictor of PHLF and may be more reliable than other predictors."
https://openalex.org/W3130974893,"Essential fructosuria (EF) is a benign, asymptomatic, autosomal recessive condition caused by loss-of-function variants in the ketohexokinase gene and characterized by intermittent appearance of fructose in the urine. Despite a basic understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of EF, relatively little is known about the long-term clinical consequences of ketohexokinase gene variants. We examined the frequency of ketohexokinase variants in the UK Biobank sample and compared the cardiometabolic profiles of groups of individuals with and without these variants alone or in combination. Study cohorts consisted of groups of participants defined based on the presence of one or more of the five ketohexokinase gene variants tested for in the Affymetrix assays used by the UK Biobank. The rs2304681:G&gt;A (p.Val49Ile) variant was present on more than one-third (36.8%) of chromosomes; other variant alleles were rare (&lt;1%). No participants with the compound heterozygous genotype present in subjects exhibiting the EF phenotype in the literature (Gly40Arg/Ala43Thr) were identified. The rs2304681:G&gt;A (p.Val49Ile), rs41288797 (p.Val188Met), and rs114353144 (p.Val264Ile) variants were more common in white versus non-white participants. Otherwise, few statistically or clinically significant differences were observed after adjustment for multiple comparisons. These findings reinforce the current understanding of EF as a rare, benign, autosomal recessive condition."
https://openalex.org/W3129914780,"CT-based quantitative analysis of any ossification center in the cranium has not previously been carried out due to the limited availability of human fetal material. Detailed morphometric data on the development of ossification centers in the human fetus may be useful in the early detection of congenital defects. Ossification disorders in the cranium are associated with either a delayed development of ossification centers or their mineralization. These aberrations may result in the formation of accessory skull bones that differ in shape and size, and the incidence of which may be misdiagnosed as, e.g., skull fractures. The study material comprised 37 human fetuses of both sexes (16♂, 21♀) aged 18–30 weeks. Using CT, digital image analysis software, 3D reconstruction and statistical methods, the linear, planar and spatial dimensions of the occipital squama ossification center were measured. The morphometric characteristics of the fused ossification center of the occipital squama show no right—left differences. In relation to gestational age, the ossification center of the occipital squama grows linearly in its right and left vertical diameters, logarithmically in its transverse diameters of both the interparietal and supraoccipital parts and projection surface area, and according to a quadratic function in its volume. The obtained numerical findings of the occipital squama ossification center may be considered age-specific references of relevance in both the estimation of gestational age and the diagnostic process of congenital defects."
https://openalex.org/W3131379571,"Saponins are secondary metabolites with antiviral properties. Low saponin (sweet) varieties of quinoa ( Chenopodium quinoa ) have been developed because seeds high in saponins taste bitter. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of saponin in resistance of quinoa to Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Differential gene expression was studied in time-series study of CMV infection. High-throughput transcriptome sequence data were obtained from 36 samples (3 varieties × +/- CMV × 1 or 4 days after inoculation × 3 replicates). Translation, lipid, nitrogen, amino acid metabolism, and mono- and sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis genes were upregulated in CMV infections. In ‘Red Head’ (bitter), CMV-induced systemic symptoms were concurrent with downregulation of a key saponin biosynthesis gene, TSARL1, four days after inoculation. In local lesion responses (sweet and semi-sweet), TSARL1 levels remained up-regulated. Known microRNAs (miRNA) (81) from 11 miR families and 876 predicted novel miRNAs were identified. Differentially expressed miRNA and short interfering RNA clusters (24nt) induced by CMV infection are predicted to target genomic and intergenic regions enriched in repetitive elements. This is the first report of integrated RNASeq and sRNASeq data in quinoa-virus interactions and provides comprehensive understanding of involved genes, non-coding regions, and biological pathways in virus resistance."

We aimed to investigate the association of higher than optimal blood pressure with measures of dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and markers of inflammation in non-diabetic Saudi adults hoping to improve current Saudi guidelines to prevent cardiovascular disease. Volunteers were recruited randomly from public healthcare centers in Jeddah. Demographic information, blood pressure (BP), and anthropometric measurements were taken. Fasting blood samples were drawn, then again following 1-hour oral glucose tolerance test. Glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipid profile, highly sensitive C- reactive protein, gamma glutamyl transferase, and 1-hour plasma glucose were measured. Complete data was found for 742 men and 592 women. Pre-hypertension was found in 47.2% of men, and 24.7% of women, while 15.1% of men, and 14.6% of women were hypertensive. Means of measured variables differed significantly between normotensive, pre-hypertensive, and hypertensive groups of men and women in gender specific manner. Association between measured variables and elevated BP, and hypertension were assessed using logistic regression models. After adjustment for age, body mass index and waist circumference, elevated blood pressure was associated with elevated triglycerides in men, while hypertension was significantly associated with elevated fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein- cholesterol, and low high density lipoprotein- cholesterol in men, and elevated triglycerides, and total cholesterol in women. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to measure lipid profile, specifically TG, for all diagnosed pre-hypertensive and hypertensive patients in addition to FPG for men."

The capsule structure of the HS1 type strain was shown previously to be composed of teichoic-acid like glycerol-galactosyl phosphate repeats [4-)-α-D-Galp-(1–2)-Gro-(1-P-] with non-stoichiometric fructose branches at the C2 and C3 of Gal and non-stoichiometric methyl phosphoramidate (MeOPN) modifications on the C3 of the fructose. Here, we demonstrate that the capsule of an HS1/44 strain is identical to that of the type strain of HS1, and the capsule of HS1/8 is also identical to HS1, except for an additional site of MeOPN modification at C6 of Gal. The DNA sequence of the capsule locus of an HS44 strain included an insertion of 10 genes, and the strain expressed two capsules, one identical to the HS1 type strain, but with no fructose branches, and another composed of heptoses and MeOPN. We also characterize a HS1 capsule biosynthesis gene, HS1.08, as a fructose transferase responsible for the attachment of the β-D-fructofuranoses residues at C2 and C3 of the Gal unit. In summary, the common component of all members of the HS1 complex is the teichoic-acid like backbone that is likely responsible for the observed sero-cross reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W3131600493,"The vertical stratification of the stand may lead to a high heterogeneity of microenvironment in the forest, which further influences the understory regeneration and succession of the forest. Most relevant previous studies emphasized the overall effects of the Whole-stand structural characteristics on understory regeneration, while the strata-specific impacts of the overstory should be explored especially for those forests with a complicated combination of overstory species and heights. In this study, a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in Tianmu Mountain of China was intensively investigated within 25 plots of 20 m × 20 m, aiming to find out how significant the stratified overstory (trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm) structure and non-structure characteristics impact the understory (trees with DBH &lt; 5 cm) regeneration. Regardless of species composition, the studied overstory was evenly divided into three strata ( i . e . upper, middle and lower strata) according to their heights. Redundancy analysis was applied to explore both overall and strata-specific forest structure on characteristics (height, DBH, species diversity, and density) of tree regeneration. We found that the overall effect of the whole overstory on the forest regeneration depended mostly on diameter at breast height (DBH), tree species richness index and crown width. However, when analyzing with the strata-specific characteristics, the most pronounced impact factors for the regeneration were tree height of the upper and lower forest strata, tree species richness index and crown width of the middle and lower forest strata, and the competition index impact of the lower forest stratum. Among the three strata, the lower forest stratum showed the most significant impact with three characteristics on the understory regeneration, which may be attributed to their direct competition within the overlapping near-ground niches. Among the new generations, seedlings and saplings were more sensitive to the overstory structural characteristics than young trees. Our results suggest that the overstory showed strata-specific effects on the understory regeneration of evergreen broad-leaved forests in subtropical China, which provides theoretical basis for strata-specific forest management in similar forests."

Moreover, we investigated the relationship between visual attentional behavior and clinical symptoms. Patients and methods Eight female patients with CRPS type 1 in their upper limbs and 8 healthy adult women participated in this study. First, the participants were asked to watch videoclips in a relaxed manner (Videoclip 1 featured young adults who introduced themselves; Videoclip 2 featured young adults touching the hand of the other person sitting across from them with their hand.) Eye movement data were tracked with eye-tracking glasses. Results In video clip 1, the fixation duration (FD) and fixation count (FC) on faces tended to be lower in CRPS patients than in healthy controls. This tendency was found in patients with low body cognitive distortions. In video clip 2, CRPS patients displayed significantly lower FD and FC on the unaffected hand while watching a video of the unaffected hand being touched compared with healthy controls. Moreover, patients with low body cognitive distortion displayed significantly longer FD on the affected hand. Conclusion Some CRPS patients differed in visual attentional behavior toward the face and body compared with healthy controls. In addition, our findings suggest that patients with lower body cognitive distortion may have a high visual attention for the affected hand, while patients with higher distortion may be neglecting the affected hand."
