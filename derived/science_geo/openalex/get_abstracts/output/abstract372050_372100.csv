https://openalex.org/W2138512826,"Although drugs are intended to be selective, at least some bind to several physiological targets, explaining side effects and efficacy. Because many drug–target combinations exist, it would be useful to explore possible interactions computationally. Here we compared 3,665 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and investigational drugs against hundreds of targets, defining each target by its ligands. Chemical similarities between drugs and ligand sets predicted thousands of unanticipated associations. Thirty were tested experimentally, including the antagonism of the β1 receptor by the transporter inhibitor Prozac, the inhibition of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) transporter by the ion channel drug Vadilex, and antagonism of the histamine H4 receptor by the enzyme inhibitor Rescriptor. Overall, 23 new drug–target associations were confirmed, five of which were potent (<100 nM). The physiological relevance of one, the drug N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on serotonergic receptors, was confirmed in a knockout mouse. The chemical similarity approach is systematic and comprehensive, and may suggest side-effects and new indications for many drugs. Most drugs are intended to be selective for a single protein target, but will commonly bind to several other targets too. Some 'off-target' events induce side effects of varying degrees of severity, though some may be essential for a drug's efficacy. A new strategy to identify potential off-target effects for known drugs is reported in this issue. The structures of 3,665 FDA-approved and investigational drugs were computationally screened against hundreds of protein targets as defined by the ligands that bind to them. Chemical similarities between the drugs and various sets of ligands predicted thousands of off-target associations, some of which were confirmed in pharmacological assays. This approach may help predict and explain the side effects of known drugs and drug candidates, and may also lead to the identification of new clinical applications for drugs that have been previously approved for use in humans. Drugs that are chemically quite similar often bind to biologically diverse protein targets, and it is unclear how selective many of these compounds are. Because many drug–target combinations exist, it would be useful to explore possible interactions computationally. Here, 3,665 drugs are tested against hundreds of targets; chemical similarities between drugs and ligand sets are found to predict thousands of unanticipated associations."
https://openalex.org/W1990188370,"Jun Wang and colleagues report the genome sequence of the cucumber. The cucumber genome is the seventh plant genome sequence to be reported and was assembled with a combination of traditional Sanger and next-generation sequencing methods. Cucumber is an economically important crop as well as a model system for sex determination studies and plant vascular biology. Here we report the draft genome sequence of Cucumis sativus var. sativus L., assembled using a novel combination of traditional Sanger and next-generation Illumina GA sequencing technologies to obtain 72.2-fold genome coverage. The absence of recent whole-genome duplication, along with the presence of few tandem duplications, explains the small number of genes in the cucumber. Our study establishes that five of the cucumber's seven chromosomes arose from fusions of ten ancestral chromosomes after divergence from Cucumis melo. The sequenced cucumber genome affords insight into traits such as its sex expression, disease resistance, biosynthesis of cucurbitacin and 'fresh green' odor. We also identify 686 gene clusters related to phloem function. The cucumber genome provides a valuable resource for developing elite cultivars and for studying the evolution and function of the plant vascular system."

Here, we find substantial hypermethylation and hypomethylation of cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) island shores in nine human iPS cell lines as compared to their parental fibroblasts. The differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the reprogrammed cells (denoted R-DMRs) were significantly enriched in tissue-specific (T-DMRs; 2.6-fold, P < 10(-4)) and cancer-specific DMRs (C-DMRs; 3.6-fold, P < 10(-4)). Notably, even though the iPS cells are derived from fibroblasts, their R-DMRs can distinguish between normal brain, liver and spleen cells and between colon cancer and normal colon cells. Thus, many DMRs are broadly involved in tissue differentiation, epigenetic reprogramming and cancer. We observed colocalization of hypomethylated R-DMRs with hypermethylated C-DMRs and bivalent chromatin marks, and colocalization of hypermethylated R-DMRs with hypomethylated C-DMRs and the absence of bivalent marks, suggesting two mechanisms for epigenetic reprogramming in iPS cells and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2133987216,"When electrons are confined in two dimensions and subjected to strong magnetic fields, the Coulomb interactions between them become dominant and can lead to novel states of matter such as fractional quantum Hall liquids. In these liquids electrons linked to magnetic flux quanta form complex composite quasipartices, which are manifested in the quantization of the Hall conductivity as rational fractions of the conductance quantum. The recent experimental discovery of an anomalous integer quantum Hall effect in graphene has opened up a new avenue in the study of correlated 2D electronic systems, in which the interacting electron wavefunctions are those of massless chiral fermions. However, due to the prevailing disorder, graphene has thus far exhibited only weak signatures of correlated electron phenomena, despite concerted experimental efforts and intense theoretical interest. Here, we report the observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect in ultraclean suspended graphene, supporting the existence of strongly correlated electron states in the presence of a magnetic field. In addition, at low carrier density graphene becomes an insulator with an energy gap tunable by magnetic field. These newly discovered quantum states offer the opportunity to study a new state of matter of strongly correlated Dirac fermions in the presence of large magnetic fields."

https://openalex.org/W2164112721,"In many sequencing applications, it is sufficient to sequence selected portions of a genome rather than the complete genome. Tewhey et al. describe an approach for massively parallel genome targeting that relies on PCR in microdroplets generated by a microfluidic device. Targeted enrichment of specific loci of the human genome is a promising approach to enable sequencing-based studies of genetic variation in large populations. Here we describe an enrichment approach based on microdroplet PCR, which enables 1.5 million amplifications in parallel. We sequenced six samples enriched by microdroplet or traditional singleplex PCR using primers targeting 435 exons of 47 genes. Both methods generated similarly high-quality data: 84% of the uniquely mapping reads fell within the targeted sequences; coverage was uniform across ∼90% of targeted bases; sequence variants were called with >99% accuracy; and reproducibility between samples was high (r2 = 0.9). We scaled the microdroplet PCR to 3,976 amplicons totaling 1.49 Mb of sequence, sequenced the resulting sample with both Illumina GAII and Roche 454, and obtained data with equally high specificity and sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that microdroplet technology is well suited for processing DNA for massively parallel enrichment of specific subsets of the human genome for targeted sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W2056752509,"Cellular apoptosis induced by hyperglycemia occurs in many vascular cells and is crucial for the initiation of diabetic pathologies. In the retina, pericyte apoptosis and the formation of acellular capillaries, the most specific vascular pathologies attributed to hyperglycemia, is linked to the loss of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-mediated survival actions owing to unknown mechanisms. Here we show that hyperglycemia persistently activates protein kinase C-delta (PKC-delta, encoded by Prkcd) and p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to increase the expression of a previously unknown target of PKC-delta signaling, Src homology-2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), a protein tyrosine phosphatase. This signaling cascade leads to PDGF receptor-beta dephosphorylation and a reduction in downstream signaling from this receptor, resulting in pericyte apoptosis independently of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling. We observed increased PKC-delta activity and an increase in the number of acellular capillaries in diabetic mouse retinas, which were not reversible with insulin treatment that achieved normoglycemia. Unlike diabetic age-matched wild-type mice, diabetic Prkcd(-/-) mice did not show activation of p38alpha MAPK or SHP-1, inhibition of PDGF signaling in vascular cells or the presence of acellular capillaries. We also observed PKC-delta, p38alpha MAPK and SHP-1 activation in brain pericytes and in the renal cortex of diabetic mice. These findings elucidate a new signaling pathway by which hyperglycemia can induce PDGF resistance and increase vascular cell apoptosis to cause diabetic vascular complications."
https://openalex.org/W2073471495,"Neural stem cells in the adult mouse SVZ are thought to only generate GABAergic olfactory bulb interneurons. This study reports that a dorsal region of the adult SVZ gives rise to a glutamatergic type of olfactory bulb neurons. These newborn glutamatergic neurons can be diverted to migrate into the cortex towards an injury, possibly contributing to repair. The adult mouse subependymal zone (SEZ) harbors neural stem cells that are thought to exclusively generate GABAergic interneurons of the olfactory bulb. We examined the adult generation of glutamatergic juxtaglomerular neurons, which had dendritic arborizations that projected into adjacent glomeruli, identifying them as short-axon cells. Fate mapping revealed that these originate from Neurog2- and Tbr2-expressing progenitors located in the dorsal region of the SEZ. Examination of the progenitors of these glutamatergic interneurons allowed us to determine the sequential expression of transcription factors in these cells that are thought to be hallmarks of glutamatergic neurogenesis in the developing cerebral cortex and adult hippocampus. Indeed, the molecular specification of these SEZ progenitors allowed for their recruitment into the cerebral cortex after a lesion was induced. Taken together, our data indicate that SEZ progenitors not only produce a population of adult-born glutamatergic juxtaglomerular neurons, but may also provide a previously unknown source of progenitors for endogenous repair."
https://openalex.org/W1964020740,"Studying a patient with selective damage to the insular and anterior cingulate cortex, the current study finds that these regions are not necessary for interoceptive awareness of one's own heartbeat, but the primary somatosensory cortex is required for such self-awareness. A network of cortical brain regions, including the insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), has been proposed as the critical and sole substrate for interoceptive awareness. Combining lesion and pharmacological approaches in humans, we found that the insula and ACC were not critical for awareness of heartbeat sensations. Instead, this awareness was mediated by both somatosensory afferents from the skin and a network that included the insula and ACC. Together, these pathways enable the core human experience of the cardiovascular state of the body."
https://openalex.org/W2158892689,"The ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosome-autophagy pathways are the two major intracellular protein degradation systems that work cooperatively to maintain homeostasis. Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) have clinical activity in hematological tumors, and inhibitors of autophagy are also being evaluated as potential antitumor therapies. In this study, we found that chemical PIs and small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the proteasome's enzymatic subunits promoted autophagosome formation, stimulated autophagic flux, and upregulated expression of the autophagy-specific genes (ATGs) (ATG5 and ATG7) in some human prostate cancer cells and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Upregulation of ATG5 and ATG7 only occurred in cells displaying PI-induced phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), an important component of the unfolded protein responses. Furthermore, PIs did not induce autophagy or upregulate ATG5 in MEFs expressing a phosphorylation-deficient mutant form of eIF2α. Combined inhibition of autophagy and the proteasome induced an accumulation of intracellular protein aggregates reminiscent of neuronal inclusion bodies and caused more cancer cell death than blocking either degradation pathway alone. Overall, our data show that proteasome inhibition activates autophagy through a phospho-eIF2α-dependent mechanism to eliminate protein aggregates and alleviate proteotoxic stress."

https://openalex.org/W1966786968,"Bacterial genomes are organized by structural and functional elements, including promoters, transcription start and termination sites, open reading frames, regulatory noncoding regions, untranslated regions and transcription units. Here, we iteratively integrate high-throughput, genome-wide measurements of RNA polymerase binding locations and mRNA transcript abundance, 5' sequences and translation into proteins to determine the organizational structure of the Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 genome. Integration of the organizational elements provides an experimentally annotated transcription unit architecture, including alternative transcription start sites, 5' untranslated region, boundaries and open reading frames of each transcription unit. A total of 4,661 transcription units were identified, representing an increase of >530% over current knowledge. This comprehensive transcription unit architecture allows for the elucidation of condition-specific uses of alternative sigma factors at the genome scale. Furthermore, the transcription unit architecture provides a foundation on which to construct genome-scale transcriptional and translational regulatory networks."

https://openalex.org/W2083467502,"The critical tumor suppressor p53 is mutated in over half of all human cancers. The majority of p53 cancer mutations are missense mutations, which can be classified into contact mutations that directly disrupt the DNA-binding of p53 but have modest impact on p53 conformation and structural mutations that greatly disrupt p53 conformation. Many p53 cancer mutants, including the hot spot mutations (R175H, R248W and R273H), not only lose p53-dependent tumor-suppressor activities, but also acquire new oncogenic activities to promote cancer. Therefore, it is critical to elucidate the gain of oncogenic function of p53 cancer mutants. Using humanized p53-mutant knock-in mouse models, we have identified a gain of oncogenic function shared by the most common p53 contact mutants (R273H and R248W) and structural mutant (R175H). This gain of function inactivates Mre11/ATM-dependent DNA damage responses, leading to chromosomal translocation and defective G(2)/M checkpoint. Considering the critical roles of ATM in maintaining genetic stability and therapeutic responses to many cancer treatments, the identification of this common gain of function of p53 cancer mutants will have important implication on the drug resistance of a significant portion of human cancers that express either the contact or structural p53 cancer mutants."

https://openalex.org/W2025221100,"Store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) and Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) currents (I(crac)) are strongly suppressed during cell division, the only known physiological situation in which Ca(2+) store depletion is uncoupled from the activation of Ca(2+) influx [corrected]. We found that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) sensor STIM1 failed to rearrange into near-plasma membrane puncta in mitotic cells, a critical step in the SOCE-activation pathway. We also found that STIM1 from mitotic cells is recognized by the phospho-specific MPM-2 antibody, suggesting that STIM1 is phosphorylated during mitosis. Removal of ten MPM-2 recognition sites by truncation at amino acid 482 abolished MPM-2 recognition of mitotic STIM1, and significantly rescued STIM1 rearrangement and SOCE response in mitosis. We identified Ser 486 and Ser 668 as mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites, and STIM1 containing mutations of these sites to alanine also significantly rescued mitotic SOCE. Therefore, phosphorylation of STIM1 at Ser 486 and Ser 668, and possibly other sites, underlies suppression of SOCE during mitosis."

This enzyme is unique in that it can transfer en bloc the oligosaccharide of various types of N-glycans onto different acceptors, and thereby it enzymatically generates diverse glycoconjugates. In this study, we performed mutational and kinetic studies focusing on a key catalytic asparagine 175 of Endo-M. We have shown that most of the Asn-175 mutants had significantly diminished hydrolysis activity but acted as glycosynthases capable of using synthetic sugar oxazoline for transglycosylation. Our results confirm the critical role of this asparagine residue in promoting the formation of an oxazolinium ion intermediate in the first step of the substrate-assisted catalysis. Interestingly, the N175Q mutant was found to possess dramatically enhanced glycosynthase-like activity with sugar oxazoline in comparison with N175A and a transglycosidase-like activity with “natural” N-glycan as well.

Structural and mechanistic studies with some GH18 ENGases and GH18 chitinases (20Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Armand S. Kalk K.H. Isogai A. Henrissat B. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15619-15623Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and GH20 β-N-acetylhexosaminidases (21Williams S.J. Mark B.L. Vocadlo D.J. James M.N. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40055-40065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have indicated that the catalysis of these GH18 and GH20 enzymes proceeds in a substrate-assisted mechanism involving the participation of the 2-acetamide group in the substrate. In this mechanism (Scheme 1), a catalytic residue (Asp or Glu) acts as a general acid to protonate the glycosidic oxygen. Upon activation of the glycosidic bond, the 2-acetamide group of the (−1)GlcNAc acts as a nucleophile to substitute the leaving group at the anomeric center, resulting in the formation of an oxazolinium ion intermediate. The catalytic carboxylate residue then acts as a general base to activate a water molecule at the catalytic center to facilitate the hydrolysis of the oxazolinium ion intermediate to form the hydrolytic product. The double sn-2 type displacement results in a retaining of the anomeric configuration. In addition, several structural analyses on GH18 chitinases and GH20 β-N-acetylhexosaminidases revealed that the proper orientation of the acetamide group may be aided by another key carboxylate residue (usually Asp) located at 1 or 2 amino acid residues upstream from the general acid/base catalytic residue (Scheme 1). The GH85 ENGases, most of which show transglycosylation activity, have been implicated to follow a similar substrate-assisted mechanism. This notion was reinforced by the fact that Endo-A and Endo-M are able to take synthetic sugar oxazolines as donor substrates for transglycosylation (22Fujita M. Shoda S. Haneda K. Inazu T. Takegawa K. Yamamoto K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Li B. Zeng Y. Hauser S. Song H. Wang L.X. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 9692-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to GH18 ENGases, there is no second conserved carboxylate residue near the general acid/base carboxylate residue. Instead, sequence alignment has indicated the presence of a conserved Asn at the second position upstream from the general acid/base catalytic residue, which might play a similar role as the second carboxylate in the GH18 and GH20 enzymes. We have recently shown that mutation of this conserved Asn residue (Asn-175) in Endo-M resulted in almost complete loss of the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme (7Umekawa M. Huang W. Li B. Fujita K. Ashida H. Wang L.X. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4469-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), suggesting a critical role of this residue in the enzymatic catalysis. Interestingly, the N175A mutant was still able to catalyze the second step of the reaction, i.e. the mutant could use a pre-synthesized sugar oxazoline as a donor substrate for transglycosylation to form a glycopeptide but lacked the hydrolysis activity for the transglycosylation product (7Umekawa M.

The corresponding Endo-A mutant, EndoA-N171A, was also capable of catalyzing the transglycosylation using high mannose-type glycan oxazoline as the donor substrate (24Huang W. Li C. Li B. Umekawa M.

Boraston A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11676-11689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), were solved by x-ray crystallographic studies, which clearly confirmed the role of the conserved Asn residue at the catalytic site in orientating the 2-acetamide group and/or stabilizing the oxazolinium ion intermediate thus formed. The novel glycosynthase, EndoM-N175A, that we have previously created has demonstrated a great potential for the synthesis of homogeneous glycoproteins carrying natural complex-type and high mannose-type N-glycans (7Umekawa M. Huang W. Li B. Fujita K. Ashida H. Wang L.X. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4469-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 24Huang W. Li C. Li B. Umekawa M. Yamamoto K. Zhang X. Wang L.X. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 2214-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of the product hydrolysis, however, the specific activity of the glycosynthase for transglycosylation was much lower than that of the wild type Endo-M. The enzymatic reactions catalyzed by the EndoM-N175A mutant are usually slow, requiring relatively large amounts of the mutant enzyme and/or extended incubation time. To improve the catalytic efficiency of the glycosynthase for practical use, we have performed a systematic mutagenesis at the critical Asn-175 site of Endo-M, as well as site-directed mutations at other conserved Glu and Asp residues to probe whether those carboxylate residues are critical in the catalysis. The mutagenesis and subsequent enzymatic evaluation have led to the identification of an array of glycosynthase mutants that showed enhanced catalytic activity. In particular, the N175Q mutant was found to possess significantly enhanced transglycosylation activity for activated sugar oxazoline, whereas its hydrolysis activity for the product was diminished. Surprisingly, this mutant was also capable of efficiently transglycosylating N-glycan while having a significantly diminished product hydrolysis activity behaving as a typical “transglycosidase.” Furthermore, a novel mutant D279A, with a single mutation at the conserved Asp-279 residue, was also found to behave as a glycosynthase. Kinetic studies reveal the nature of the enhancement of the transglycosylation efficiency and provide further insights into the transglycosylation mechanism of Endo-M.

Analytical reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was performed on a HITACHI D-2000 Elite instrument with a Cosmosil 5C18-AR II column (4.6 × 150 mm, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) at 40 °C or on a Waters 626 HPLC instrument with a Symmetry300TM C18 column (5.0 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) at 40 °C. The column was eluted with a linear gradient using one of the following four methods, depending on the properties of the compounds to be separated: method A, 0–15% MeCN containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 12 min; method B, 22% MeCN containing 25 mm sodium borate (pH 7.5) for 15 min and 22–35% for next 11 min; method C, 5–20% MeCN containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min; and method D, 0–30% MeCN containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min. The mutants were generated by PCR using KOD-plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Japan) according to the procedure for a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the pET23b-Endo-M plasmid, containing cDNA fragment of the wild type Endo-M fused a His6 tag at C terminus, as a template DNA (7Umekawa M.

For saturation mutagenesis of Asn-175 residue, a forward primer, 5′-CTATGGTTTTGATGGCTGGTTGTTCNNSATTGAATGCGAATTC-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-GAATTCGCATTCAATSNNGAACAACCAGCCATCAAAACCATAG-3′, were used. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids containing mutated Endo-M genes were introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Expression and purification of enzymes were carried out using the Ni2+-charged chelating column as described in our previous paper (7Umekawa M. Huang W. Li B. Fujita K. Ashida H. Wang L.X. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4469-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo) and used in the following enzyme assay. Assay for the hydrolysis activity of each enzyme was performed at 30 °C with 4 mm SGP or 0.31–20 mm DNS-SGN as a substrate in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5, 20 μl), and the reaction was stopped by boiling for 3 min. The reaction mixtures, including SGP or dansylated SGN, were analyzed by RP-HPLC using method A or method B, respectively. Residual substrates and the hydrolysis products in the reaction mixture were detected at UV 214 nm or fluorescence (excitation, 355 nm; emission, 460 nm) for SGP or DNS-SGN, respectively. One unit of the enzyme was defined as the amount of protein yielding 1 μmol of peptide-GlcNAc per min at 30 °C by using SGP as a donor substrate. The transglycosylation reaction with synthetic sugar oxazoline was assayed as follows: 7.5 mm Man9GlcNAc-oxazoline, 20 mm pNP-GlcNAc, and 0.4 μg of the wild type (WT) Endo-M or 4.0 μg of each mutant enzyme was incubated at 30 °C in a sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.5, 80 μl) containing 10% DMSO, which enhances the solubility of the pNP-GlcNAc in the buffer. The reaction mixture was analyzed by RP-HPLC using method C. The residual acceptor substrate (pNP-GlcNAc) and the transglycosylation product (Man9GlcNAc2-pNP) were detected at 280 nm with a UV detector. The quantity of the transglycosylation product was calculated by integration of the peaks and normalized with the absorbance as follows: transglycosylation product (mm) = (product/(product + residual acceptor)) × 20 (initial molar concentration of acceptor). The transglycosylation activity for natural glycopeptide SGP was measured using a chitinase-coupled method described previously (29Hauser S. Song H. Li H. Wang L.X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This method was able to monitor the transglycosylation product once formed without the enzymatic re-hydrolysis, because co-incubated chitinase promptly hydrolyzes the transglycosylation product to yield a fluorescence as follows: the solution of 1 mm SGP, 2.5 mm 4MU-GlcNAc, and 100 milliunits of chitinase from S. griseus was incubated with WT (3 μg), Y217F (3 μg), or N175Q (15 μg) in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) containing 10% DMSO. The transglycosylation reactions were monitored as described previously (7Umekawa M. Huang W. Li B. Fujita K. Ashida H. Wang L.X. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4469-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). TLC analysis of the transglycosylation reaction was carried out as follows: 1 mm SGP, 10 mm GlcNAc, and each enzyme, WT (0.56 μg), Y217F (0.80 μg), or N175Q (8.0 μg) were incubated in 25 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.0, 80 μl) at 30 °C. Sugars were detected in the same manner as described previously (7Umekawa M. Huang W. Li B. Fujita K. Ashida H. Wang L.X. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4469-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Transglycosylation to GlcNAc-pentapeptide using SGP as the donor substrate was carried out as follows: 9 mm SGP, 3 mm GlcNAc-pentapeptide and WT (1 μg), or Y217F (1.2 μg) or N175Q (12 μg) were incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5, 100 μl) at 30 °C. Aliquots (10 μl each) were taken at intervals and heated at 100 °C for 3 min to stop the reaction. The transglycosylation product ((NeuAc-Gal-GlcNAc-Man)2Man-GlcNAc2-pentapeptide) and the residual SGP were quantified using RP-HPLC in method D at UV 214 nm in a same manner as described previously (7Umekawa M.

The transglycosylation reactions for kinetic studies of the mutants were assessed at 30 °C for 5 or 10 min in a reaction buffer containing 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 10 mm Man9GlcNAc-oxazoline, and an appropriate amount of respective enzyme (0.25 μg of N175Q, 0.5 μg of Y217F/N175Q, 0.5 μg of N175G, 0.5 μg of D279A, or 6 μg of N171A) in a total of 5 μl. To determine the apparent Km values for the acceptor substrate, the concentration of Man9GlcNAc-oxazoline was fixed at 10 mm, whereas the concentration of the acceptor GlcNAc-pNP was varied as 0.63–20 mm. To determine the Km values for Man9GlcNAc-oxazoline, the acceptor concentration was fixed at 20 mm, and the concentration of Man9GlcNAc-oxazoline was varied as 0.63–10 mm. The reaction was monitored by RP-HPLC using method C. The hydrolysis of Man9GlcNAc-oxazoline by Endo-M and its mutants was performed at 30 °C in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 10% DMSO. A solution of Man9GlcNAc-oxazoline at various concentrations (0.31–10 mm) in a phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 7.2, containing 10% DMSO, total volume, 5 μl) was incubated with 0.3 μg of WT or 0.4 μg of N175Q or 4 μg of N175A at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated after 5 min by the addition of an equal volume of 10% tetrahydrofuran in aqueous sodium hydroxide (0.2 m). The aliquots were then analyzed by high performance anion-exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometric detection, and the hydrolytic product Man9GlcNAc was quantified according to our previously described method (30Wang L.X. Ni J. Singh S. Li H. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 127-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The parameters Km and Vmax were obtained by fitting the experimental data into the Michaelis-Menten kinetics model in GraphPad Prism. A solution of GlcNAc-CD52 (7 mm) and Man9GlcNAc-oxazoline (35 mm) or CT-GlcNAc-oxazoline (35 mm) in a phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0, 30 μl) was incubated with N175Q (20 μg) at 30 °C. After 10 min, the transglycosylation was completed to give the corresponding glycoform of CD52. The transglycosylation products were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC and characterized by ESI-MS. For analytical HPLC, Symmetry300TM C18 column (5.0 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) at 40 °C, a linear gradient of 0–10% MeCN containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 20 min at the flow rate of 1 ml/min was used. For high mannose-type glycoform Man9GlcNAc2-CD52 was an 84% yield and tR = 12.6 min (analytical HPLC); ESI-MS was as follows: calculated for C115H190N18O78, M = 3071.14; found, 1024.77 [M + 3H]3+, 768.89 [M + 4H]4+. For complex-type glycoform CT-GlcNAc2-CD52 was a 76% yield and tR = 12.5 min (analytical HPLC); ESI-MS was as follows: calculated for C107H176N20O68, M = 2829.09; found, 1415.68 [M + 2H]2+, 944.09 [M + 3H]3+, 708.33 [M + 4H]4+. We previously found that the N175A mutant of Endo-M behaves as a “glycosynthase”; it can use the activated sugar oxazoline as a donor substrate for transglycosylation, but it lacks the activity to hydrolyze the product formed (7Umekawa M. Huang W. Li B. Fujita K. Ashida H. Wang L.X. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4469-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the specific activity of the N175A mutant was very low and therefore required a large amount of enzyme to accomplish a synthesis. To search for more efficient glycosynthase mutants, we tried to systematically replace Asn-175 with other 19 natural amino acid residues except proline. The resulting 18 N175 mutants were overproduced in E. coli, and their hydrolysis activities for N-glycan and transglycosylation activities of sugar oxazoline were assessed. As to the specific hydrolysis activity for N-glycopeptide SGP, all the Asn-175 mutants showed none or only marginal activity, confirming the critical role of the Asn-175 residue in N-glycan hydrolysis. Only six mutants, N175D, N175Q, N175H, N175S, N175M, and N175T, retained some residual hydrolytic activity (∼0.5% that of the wild type) (Table 1).TABLE 1Comparison of the specific hydrolysis activities of the Asn-175 mutants for natural N-glycan substrateMutantSpecific hydrolysis activityaThe hydrolysis activity was determined using 4 mm SGP as the substrate.Percentage of specific hydrolysis activityμmol min− mg−%Wild type9.5100N175A1.1 × 10−20.12N175G1.8 × 10−30.019N175V7.2 × 10−30.076N175L4.9 × 10−40.0052N175I6.0 × 10−40.0063N175D4.2 × 10−20.44N175E1.5 × 10−20.16N175Q6.1 × 10−20.64N175H5.0 × 10−20.52N175C7.6 × 10−30.080N175S5.5 × 10−20.57N175M4.0 × 10−20.42N175T4.5 × 10−20.47N175Y7.8 × 10−40.0082N175F1.8 × 10−30.019N175W3.1 × 10−40.0033N175R4.2 × 10−50.00044N175K2.0 × 10−40.0021a The hydrolysis activity was determined using 4 mm SGP as the substrate. Open table in a new tab Next, the transglycosylation activities of the Asn-175 mutants using sugar oxazoline were compared with that of the N175A (Fig. 1A). Despite their dramatic loss of the hydrolysis activity, most of the Asn-175 mutants showed transglycosylation activity with Man9GlcNAc-oxazoline (Fig. 1A). Among all these glycosynthase-like mutants, N175Q showed extraordinarily high transglycosylation activity, and the initial rate was about 9 times and 1.5 times higher than those of N175A and WT, respectively (Fig. 1B). We also created the double mutant N175Q/Y217F, because the Y217F mutant was previously found to accelerate transglycosylation by increasing affinity for acceptor substrate (7Umekawa M. Huang W. Li B. Fujita K. Ashida H. Wang L.X. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4469-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It was found that the double mutant was a glycosynthase, but unexpectedly the additional mutation at Tyr-217 did not further enhance the activity (Fig. 1, A and B). Some of the Asn-175 mutants replaced by bulky residues, such as Arg, Lys, Trp, and Tyr, did not show any detectable transglycosylation activity in our assay conditions (data not shown). The above results clearly demonstrate that the Asn-175 residue plays an important role not only in the formation and stabilization of the oxazoline but also in the second step involving the transglycosylation and hydrolysis of the oxazolinium ion intermediate. It was clear that Asn-175 has a key role in the formation of an oxazolinium ion intermediate. However, in GH18 and GH20 enzymes, there is a conserved aspartate residue, not asparagine residue, at the corresponding position to promote oxazolinium ion formation. Thus, it is still possible that other conserved carboxylate residues might function in concert with the conserved asparagine residue for the catalysis. To test this hypothesis, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis on other conserved carboxylate residues and examined each effect on hydrolytic activity for natural N-glycan substrate (Table 2) and transglycosylation activity for sugar oxazoline (Fig. 2). By amino acid sequence comparison with other GH85 enzymes, Asp-89, Asp-147, Asp-158, Asp-170, Glu-177, Asp-218, and Asp-279 of Endo-M were found to be highly conserved among the enzymes in the family. Each carboxylate residue was replaced with alanine, and all of the mutants except D89A were overproduced in E. coli. It was found that mutation at the general acid/base residue Glu-177 with alanine resulted in a complete loss of hydrolytic activity for SGP, which is consistent with our previous study implicating the critical role of the Glu-177 in the enzymatic catalysis (7Umekawa M.

Interestingly, the D170A, D218A, and D279A mutants also demonstrated dramatically reduced hydrolysis activity, suggesting that these carboxylate residues also play an important part in the catalytic hydrolysis. In fact, recent structural analysis of GH85 homologous enzymes, Endo-A and Endo-D, implicated that these equivalent residues are in the active site of the enzyme (25Ling Z. Suits M.D. Bingham R.J.

https://openalex.org/W1988456052,"Hypoxia elicits endothelial dysfunction, in part, through reduced expression of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). Here we present evidence that hypoxia causes a rapid decrease in the transcription of the eNOS/NOS3 gene, accompanied by decreased acetylation and lysine 4 (histone H3) methylation of eNOS proximal promoter histones. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that histones are rapidly evicted from the eNOS proximal promoter during hypoxia. We also demonstrate endothelium-specific H2A.Z incorporation at the eNOS promoter and find that H2A.Z is also evicted by hypoxic stimulation. After longer durations of hypoxia, histones are reincorporated at the eNOS promoter, but these histones lack substantial histone acetylation. Additionally, we identify a key role for the chromatin remodeler, BRG1, in re-establishing eNOS expression following reoxygenation of hypoxic cells. We posit that post-translational histone modifications are required to maintain constitutive eNOS transcriptional activity and that histone eviction rapidly resets histone marks and is a proximal event in the hypoxic repression of eNOS. Although nucleosome eviction has been reported in models of transcriptional activation, the observation that eviction can also accompany transcriptional repression in hypoxic mammalian cells argues that eviction may be broadly relevant to both positive and negative changes in transcription."

In Drosophila, the class IV dendritic arborization neuron (ddaC) undergoes pruning to remove its larval dendrites during metamorphosis. We identified Sox14 as a transcription factor that was necessary and sufficient to mediate dendrite severing during pruning in response to ecdysone signaling. We found that Sox14 mediated dendrite pruning by directly regulating the expression of the target gene mical. mical Encodes a large cytosolic protein with multiple domains that are known to associate with cytoskeletal components. mical Mutants had marked severing defects during dendrite pruning that were similar to those of sox14 mutants. Overexpression of Mical could significantly rescue pruning defects in sox14 mutants, suggesting that Mical is a major downstream target of Sox14 during pruning. Thus, our findings indicate that a previously unknown pathway composed of Sox14 and its cytoskeletal target Mical governs dendrite severing."

https://openalex.org/W2067714961,"Expression and cellular distribution of claudin-1, a tight junction protein, is dysregulated in colon cancer and its overexpression in colon cancer cells induced dedifferentiation and increased invasion. However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying dysregulated claudin-1 expression in colon cancer remains poorly understood. Histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent histone acetylation is an important mechanism of the regulation of cancer-related genes and inhibition of HDACs induces epithelial differentiation and decreased invasion. Therefore, in this study, we examined the role of HDAC-dependent epigenetic regulation of claudin-1 in colon cancer. In this study, we show that sodium butyrate and Trichostatin A (TSA), two structurally different and widely used HDAC inhibitors, inhibited claudin-1 expression in multiple colon cancer cell lines. Further studies revealed modulation of claudin-1 mRNA stability by its 3'-UTR as the major mechanism underlying HDAC-dependent claudin-1 expression. In addition, overexpression of claudin-1 abrogated the TSA-induced inhibition of invasion in colon cancer cells suggesting functional crosstalk. Analysis of mRNA expression in colon cancer patients, showed a similar pattern of increase in claudin-1 and HDAC-2 mRNA expression throughout all stages of colon cancer. Inhibition of claudin-1 expression by HDAC-2-specific small interfering RNA further supported the role of HDAC-2 in this regulation. Taken together, we report a novel post-transcriptional regulation of claudin-1 expression in colon cancer cells and further show a functional correlation between claudin-1 expression and TSA-mediated regulation of invasion. As HDAC inhibitors are considered to be promising anticancer drugs, these new findings will have implications in both laboratory and clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2059383510,"Genetic or nutritional disorders in homocysteine (Hcy) or folate metabolism elevate plasma Hcy-thiolactone and lead to vascular and/or brain pathologies. Hcy-thiolactone has the ability to form isopeptide bonds with protein lysine residues, which generates N-Hcy-protein with autoimmunogenic and prothrombotic properties. Paraoxonase (PON1), carried on high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) in the blood, hydrolyzes Hcy-thiolactone and protects against the accumulation of N-Hcy-protein in vitro. To determine its role in vivo, we studied how natural variation in Hcy-thiolactonase activity of PON1 affects plasma N-Hcy-protein levels in cystathionine ß-synthase-deficient patients (n=28). We found that plasma N-Hcy-protein was negatively correlated with serum Hcy-thiolactonase activity (r=-0.43, P=0.01), i.e., the higher the Hcythiolactonase activity, the lower N-Hcy protein levels. This relation was faithfully replicated in vitro in experiments with radiolabeled Hcy-thiolactone. We also found that enzymatic activities of the PON1 protein measured with artificial substrates correlated less strongly (r=-0.36, P=0.025 for paraoxonase activity) or did not correlate at all (phenylacetate hydrolase and TBLase activities) with plasma N-Hcy protein. These findings provide evidence that the Hcy-thiolactonase activity of PON1 is a determinant of plasma N-Hcy-protein levels and that Hcy-thiolactonase/PON1 protects proteins against N-homocysteinylation in vivo, a novel mechanism likely to contribute to atheroprotective roles of HDL in humans.—Perla-Kaján, J., Jakubowski, H.

https://openalex.org/W2145887862,"Although Wnt signaling activation is frequently observed in human breast cancer, mutations in genes encoding intracellular components of the Wnt signaling pathway are rare. We found that the expression of Wnt signaling co-receptor, LRP6, is upregulated in a subset of human breast cancer tissues and cell lines. To examine whether the overexpression of LRP6 in mammary epithelial cells is sufficient to activate Wnt signaling and promote cell proliferation, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing LRP6 in mammary epithelial cells driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter. We found that mammary glands from MMTV-LRP6 mice exhibit significant Wnt activation evidenced by the translocation of beta-catenin from membrane to cytoplasmic/nuclear fractions. The expression of several Wnt target genes including Axin2, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc was also increased in MMTV-LRP6 mice. More importantly, mammary glands from virgin MMTV-LRP6 mice exhibit significant hyperplasia, a precursor to breast cancer, when compared with wild-type littermate controls. Several matrix metalloproteinases are upregulated in MMTV-LRP6 mice that could contribute to the hyperplasia phenotype. Our results suggest that Wnt signaling activation at the cell-surface receptor level can contribute to breast cancer tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2081828965,"Notch signaling is a highly conserved pathway important for normal embryonic development and cancer. We previously demonstrated a role for Notch3 in lung cancer pathogenesis. Notch3 inhibition resulted in tumor apoptosis and growth suppression. In vitro, these effects were enhanced when the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway was also inhibited, suggesting significant cross-talk between the two pathways. How Notch3 and epidermal growth factor receptor–mitogen-activated protein kinase (EGFR–MAPK) pathways cooperate in modulating apoptosis is not yet known. In this study, we provide evidence that Notch3 regulates Bim, a BH-3-only protein, via MAPK signaling. Furthermore, loss of Bim expression prevents tumor apoptosis induced by Notch3 inhibition. Using γ-secretase inhibitor and erlotinib in a xenograft model, Bim induction and tumor inhibition were observed to be enhanced compared with either agent alone, consistent with our previous observation of significant synergism between Notch and EGFR–ras–MAPK signaling. Thus, our data support the hypothesis that Notch3 not only has a crucial role in lung cancer through regulating apoptosis, but also cooperates with the EGFR–MAPK pathway in modulating Bim."
https://openalex.org/W2026099579,"With a flood of cancer genome sequences expected soon, distinguishing 'driver' from 'passenger' mutations will be an important task. Wang et al. describe a bioinformatic method for identifying cancer-associated fusions and apply it to discover a recurrent rearrangement in lung cancer. Cancer genomes contain many aberrant gene fusions—a few that drive disease and many more that are nonspecific passengers. We developed an algorithm (the concept signature or 'ConSig' score) that nominates biologically important fusions from high-throughput data by assessing their association with 'molecular concepts' characteristic of cancer genes, including molecular interactions, pathways and functional annotations. Copy number data supported candidate fusions and suggested a breakpoint principle for intragenic copy number aberrations in fusion partners. By analyzing lung cancer transcriptome sequencing and genomic data, we identified a novel R3HDM2-NFE2 fusion in the H1792 cell line. Lung tissue microarrays revealed 2 of 76 lung cancer patients with genomic rearrangement at the NFE2 locus, suggesting recurrence. Knockdown of NFE2 decreased proliferation and invasion of H1792 cells. Together, these results present a systematic analysis of gene fusions in cancer and describe key characteristics that assist in new fusion discovery."
https://openalex.org/W1970473761,"It has previously been shown that misfolded mutant Akita proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum engages directly in protein complexes either with nonmutant proinsulin or with “hProCpepGFP” (human proinsulin bearing emerald-GFP within the C-peptide), impairing the trafficking of these “bystander” proinsulin molecules (Liu, M., Hodish, I., Rhodes, C. J., and Arvan, P. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 15841–15846). Herein, we generated transgenic mice, which, in addition to expressing endogenous proinsulin, exhibit β-cell-specific expression of hProCpepGFP via the Ins1 promoter. In these mice, hProCpepGFP protein levels are physiologically regulated, and hProCpepGFP is packaged and processed to CpepGFP that is co-stored in β-secretory granules. Visualization of CpepGFP fluorescence provides a quantifiable measure of pancreatic islet insulin content that can be followed in live animals in states of health and disease. We examined loss of pancreatic insulin in hProCpepGFP transgenic mice mated to Akita mice that develop neonatal diabetes because of the expression of misfolded proinsulin. Loss of bystander insulin in Akita animals is detected initially as a block in CpepGFP/insulin production with intracellular accumulation of the precursor, followed ultimately by loss of pancreatic β-cells. The data support that misfolded proinsulin perturbs bystander proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to β-cell failure. It has previously been shown that misfolded mutant Akita proinsulin in the endoplasmic reticulum engages directly in protein complexes either with nonmutant proinsulin or with “hProCpepGFP” (human proinsulin bearing emerald-GFP within the C-peptide), impairing the trafficking of these “bystander” proinsulin molecules (Liu, M., Hodish, I., Rhodes, C. J., and Arvan, P. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 15841–15846). Herein, we generated transgenic mice, which, in addition to expressing endogenous proinsulin, exhibit β-cell-specific expression of hProCpepGFP via the Ins1 promoter. In these mice, hProCpepGFP protein levels are physiologically regulated, and hProCpepGFP is packaged and processed to CpepGFP that is co-stored in β-secretory granules. Visualization of CpepGFP fluorescence provides a quantifiable measure of pancreatic islet insulin content that can be followed in live animals in states of health and disease.

https://openalex.org/W2063159220,"The Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is carried by more than 90% of the adult world population and has been implicated in several human malignancies. Its ability to induce unlimited in vitro proliferation of B cells is frequently used to generate lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). In this study, we have investigated the evolution of two LCLs up to 25 weeks after EBV infection. LCLs were karyotyped once a month by spectral karyotyping (SKY). LCLs but not mitogen-activated B cells showed evidence of DNA damage and DNA damage response within the first 2 weeks. After 4 weeks, the former, but not the latter, showed a high level of non-clonal structural aberrations, mainly deletions, fragments, dicentric chromosomes and unbalanced translocations. Genomic instability decreased thereafter over time. Nonrandom aneuploidy 12 weeks after infection showed clonal evolution in culture. After 25 weeks post-infection, most cells exhibited karyotypic stability. Chromosomal aberrations were compatible with telomere dysfunction, although in the absence of telomere shortening. The telomere capping protein TRF2 was partially displaced from telomeres in EBV-infected cells, suggesting an EBV-mediated uncapping problem. In conclusion, this study suggests that DNA damage and telomere dysfunction contribute to EBV-related chromosomal instability in early LCLs."
https://openalex.org/W2037195684,"Pyk2 is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase related to focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Compensatory Pyk2 expression occurs upon FAK loss in mice. However, the impact of Pyk2 up-regulation remains unclear. Previous studies showed that nuclear-localized FAK promotes cell proliferation and survival through FAK FERM domain-enhanced p53 tumor suppressor degradation (Lim, S. T., Chen, X.

Here, we show that FAK knockdown triggered p53 activation and G1 cell cycle arrest in human umbilical vein endothelial cells after 4 days. However, by 7 days elevated Pyk2 expression occurred with a reduction in p53 levels and the release of the G1 block under conditions of continued FAK knockdown. To determine whether Pyk2 regulates p53, experiments were performed in FAK−/−p21−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts expressing endogenous Pyk2 and in ID8 ovarian carcinoma cells expressing both Pyk2 and FAK. In both cell lines, Pyk2 knockdown increased p53 levels and inhibited cell proliferation associated with G1 cell cycle arrest. Pyk2 FERM domain re-expression was sufficient to reduce p53 levels and promote increased BrdUrd incorporation. Pyk2 FERM promoted Mdm2-dependent p53 ubiquitination. Pyk2 FERM effects on p53 were blocked by proteasomal inhibition or mutational-inactivation of Pyk2 FERM nuclear localization. Staurosporine stress of ID8 cells promoted endogenous Pyk2 nuclear accumulation and enhanced Pyk2 binding to p53. Pyk2 knockdown potentiated ID8 cell death upon staurosporine addition. Moreover, Pyk2 FERM expression in human fibroblasts upon FAK knockdown prevented cisplatin-mediated apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2051043876,"DNA amplifications in breast cancer are frequent on chromosome 11q, in which multiple driver oncogenes likely reside in addition to cyclin D1 (CCND1). One such candidate, the scaffolding adapter protein, GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2), functions in ErbB signaling and was recently shown to enhance mammary epithelial cell proliferation, and metastasis of ERBB2 (HER2/neu)-driven murine breast cancer. However, the amplification status and function of GAB2 in the context of amplification remain undefined. In this study, by genomic profiling of 172 breast tumors, and fluorescence in situ hybridization validation in an independent set of 210 scorable cases, we observed focal amplification spanning GAB2 (11q14.1) independent of CCND1 (11q13.2) amplification, consistent with a driver role. Further, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of GAB2 in breast cancer lines (SUM52, SUM44PE and MDA468) with GAB2 amplification revealed a dependency on GAB2 for cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, survival and invasion, likely mediated through altered phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. GAB2 knockdown also reduced proliferation and survival in a cell line (BT474) with ERBB2 amplification, consistent with the possibility that GAB2 can function downstream of ERBB2. Our studies implicate focal amplification of GAB2 in breast carcinogenesis, and underscore an oncogenic role of scaffolding adapter proteins, and a potential new point of therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2066121337,"Epigenetic silencing is mediated by families of factors that place, remove, read, and transmit repressive histone and DNA methylation marks on chromatin. How the roles for these functionally diverse factors are specified and integrated is the subject of intense study. To address these questions, HeLa cells harboring epigenetically silent green fluorescent protein reporter genes were interrogated with a small interference RNA library targeting 200 predicted epigenetic regulators, including potential activators, silencers, chromatin remodelers, and ancillary factors. Using this approach, individual, or combinatorial requirements for specific epigenetic silencing factors could be detected by measuring green fluorescent protein reactivation after small interference RNA-based factor knockdown. In our analyses, we identified a specific subset of 15 epigenetic factors that are candidates for participation in a functional epigenetic silencing network in human cells. These factors include histone deacetylase 1, de novo DNA methyltransferase 3A, components of the polycomb PRC1 complex (RING1 and HPH2), and the histone lysine methyltransferases KMT1E and KMT5C. Roles were also detected for two TRIM protein family members, the cohesin component Rad21, and the histone chaperone CHAF1A (CAF-1 p150). Remarkably, combinatorial knockdown of factors was not required for reactivation, indicating little functional redundancy. Consistent with this interpretation, knockdown of either KMT1E or CHAF1A resulted in a loss of multiple histone-repressive marks and concomitant gain of activation marks on the promoter during reactivation. These results reveal how functionally diverse factors may cooperate to maintain gene silencing during normal development or in disease.

Furthermore, the findings suggest an avenue for discovery of new targets for epigenetic therapies. Epigenetic processes control the binary on-off states of specific gene sets, thereby creating heritable transcription patterns that drive development and maintain cellular identity. It is now well established that chromatin-based mechanisms underlie such epigenetic control, largely mediated by intricate chemical marks that are placed or removed by chromatin-modifying enzymes (1Bernstein B.E.

Cell. 2007; 25: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The prominent epigenetic regulatory marks on eukaryotic chromatin are histone modifications and DNA cytosine methylation (5meCpG), which are placed by enzyme complexes containing members of the histone modifying and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 4The abbreviations used are: DNMTDNA methyltransferaseDNMTiDNMT inhibitorGFPgreen fluorescent proteinsiRNAsmall interfering RNAFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingLTRlong terminal repeatCMVcytomegalovirusHDAChistone deacetylaseHDACiHDAC inhibitorMBDmethyl-CpG-binding proteinKATlysine acetyltransferaseKMTlysine methyltransferaseKDMlysine demethylaseKMTlysine methyltransferasePcGpolycomb groupGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationTIF1transcriptional intermediary factor 1TSAtrichostatin A5-azaC5-azacytidineTRIMtripartite motifCAF-1chromatin assembly factor-1PRC1polycomb repressor complexEF1αelongation factor 1αH3K9histone H3 lysine 9polpolymeraseTSStranscriptional start site. families, respectively. The histone tails that protrude from nucleosomes are thus decorated by a variety of position-specific “histone code” marks, including acetyl, methyl, and ubiquitin lysine modifications. In contrast, DNA-based epigenetic regulation is limited to DNA methylation. Histone marks may be either activating or repressive, whereas the 5meCpG DNA mark is strictly repressive. The presence or absence of these chromatin marks provide cues for recruitment of downstream protein effectors that positively or negatively affect transcription or may also directly influence chromatin structure and function.

The heritable transcriptional off-state is denoted “epigenetic silencing.” The corresponding silent regions are generally characterized by hypoacetylated histones, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) di- or trimethylation (H3K9me2/3), and DNA hypermethylation. These marks guide the formation of heterochromatic-like features over gene promoters or broader areas (2Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are generally viewed as repressive epigenetic regulators that maintain the hypoacetylated histone state, thereby antagonizing the transcription-promoting activities of lysine acetyltransferases (KATs). The repressive H3K9 methyl histone mark is placed by lysine methyltranferases (KMTs) and is read by the effector heterochromatin protein 1 (2Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Repressive methyl marks can potentially be antagonized by lysine demethylase (KDM) activities (8Shi Y. Whetstine J.R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The 5meCpG DNA marks, placed by DNMT enzymes, are read by methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs) to promote silencing (3Klose R.J. Bird A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 89-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). Both HDAC- and DNMT-based epigenetic silencing can sometimes be reversed by chemical inhibitors (9Bolden J.E. Peart M.J. Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev.

HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) act by favoring KAT-mediated activating acetylation marks, whereas DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi) cause a passive loss of the repressive DNA methylation marks during cell division.

There is substantial interest in identifying functional networks of epigenetic silencing factors, because such knowledge may provide additional therapeutic targets. However, the processes surrounding enzymatic placement and removal, as well as decoding, of epigenetic marks are highly complex. For example, a variety of combinatorial, temporal, dynamic, and context-dependent histone modifications have been described (2Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev.

In view of these vast complexities, we have implemented a functional assay to identify silencing factor repertoires. This strategy has uncovered an epigenetic network in human cells and provides a general method for the identification of factors that may serve as targets for epigenetic therapies. The primary GFP-silent reporter cells used in the screen comprises a HeLa cell population that harbors silent GFP-reporter genes under control of the CMV promoter (previously denoted TI-C) (22Katz R.A. Jack-Scott E. Narezkina A. Palagin I. Boimel P. Kulkosky J. Nicolas E. Greger J.G. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2592-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Clones derived from this population were described previously (22Katz R.A. Jack-Scott E. Narezkina A. Palagin I. Boimel P. Kulkosky J. Nicolas E. Greger J.G. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2592-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Poleshko A. Palagin I. Zhang R. Boimel P. Castagna C. Adams P.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2313-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the secondary GFP-silent reporter cell population, the GFP gene is under control of the weaker retroviral LTR promoter (previously denoted TI-L) (22Katz R.A. Jack-Scott E. Narezkina A. Palagin I. Boimel P. Kulkosky J. Nicolas E. Greger J.G. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2592-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A third reporter population harbors the silent GFP under control of the EF1α cellular promoter. Selection of 5-azaC-responsive reporter cells (denoted AI) was similar to that described previously for TSA-responsive GFP-silent reporter cells (denoted TI) (22Katz R.A. Jack-Scott E. Narezkina A. Palagin I. Boimel P. Kulkosky J. Nicolas E. Greger J.G. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2592-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were infected with an avian retroviral vector encoding the GFP reporter gene under control of the CMV promoter, and the population of GFP-negative cells was sorted at 7–10 days post-infection. These GFP-negative cells were treated with 5 μm 5-AzaC (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h to reveal HeLa cells harboring silent GFP genes, and the GFP-expressing cells were sorted after 48 h. After passage for 10 days in the absence of 5-azaC, there was a significant loss of GFP expression by re-silencing, and the resulting GFP-negative cells were purified by cell sorting. Treatment of these cells with 5-azaC resulted in reactivation of GFP, as expected (data not shown). Screening was performed with an siRNA set encompassing the human epigenetics family (Qiagen) (Fig. 1B). This set comprises siRNAs that target 189 genes and was complemented with 11 additional siRNA targets (supplemental Table S1). Two independent siRNAs for each target were provided with the library. For follow-up validation analyses, a minimum of four, and up to seven independent siRNAs were analyzed (Fig. 2 and supplemental Figs. S1 and S2).FIGURE 2Compiled analyses of 15 validated hits with four independent siRNAs. Response is measured by FACS, as the percentage of GFP-positive cells produced by siRNA treatment. Each bar indicates an independent siRNA for the designated target. Error bars indicate standard deviation for each siRNA (n = 6). HDAC1 and GAPDH siRNA were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Gray bars indicates that the response fulfills the criteria for a positive response for a particular siRNA (see supplemental Fig. S1, gray), whereas empty bars indicate a non-hit. Panel A shows results with a cell population in which the silent GFP reporter is under control of the CMV promoter, and Panel B shows a cell population in which the retroviral LTR controls the silent GFP gene. Discrepancy in scoring hits for several targets is likely the result of the lower GFP signals from the weaker LTR promoter in Panel B (see Table 1). Note: During the course of this work, we provided results from our initial screen regarding KDM2A (hit) and KDM2B (non-hit) to the laboratory of Dr. Michele Pagano. The relevant data points from the primary screen were included in a collaborative publication (27Frescas D. Guardavaccaro D. Kuchay S.M. Kato H. Poleshko A. Basrur V. Elenitoba-Johnson K.S. Katz R.A.

Robotic pipetting was carried out using the CyBi Well Vario (CyBio). A solution containing siRNAs and DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon) transfection reagent diluted in Hanks' balanced salt solution were first dispensed into 96-well plates, followed by addition of cells. The final concentration of siRNA was 50 nm, and the final transfection volume was 100 μl, with a cell number of 5000 per well. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h, after which time the transfection medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After a total of 96 h post-transfection, cells were scored for GFP expression using a 96-well EasyCyte Plus FACS (Millipore-Guava Technologies). GFP(+) cells were measured using Guava EasyCyte Plus flow analyzer software (CytoSoft, Millipore-Guava). The data were scored as percent GFP-positive cells, and FACS profiles were analyzed for GFP mean fluorescence intensity. A mean fluorescence intensity cutoff was not used as a strict criterion, but most validated hits demonstrated intense GFP expression (supplemental Fig. S3). The positive and negative controls for the screen were an HDAC1 siRNA SMARTpool (Dharmacon) and a single siRNA targeting GAPDH, respectively, based on our previous study (23Poleshko A. Palagin I. Zhang R. Boimel P. Castagna C. Adams P.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2313-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To evaluate the efficiency and reproducibility of the screening protocol, the Z′-factor was calculated (24Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). The Z′-factor was measured in three independent experiments using the primary reporter cell population. For this measurement, 96-well plates were used containing 48 positive control and 48 negative control siRNA-treated wells targeting HDAC1 and GAPDH, respectively. The Z′-factor was calculated as (1 − (3×(sp+ sn)/(μp− μn))), with the sp and sn being the standard deviation of positive and negative values and μp and μn the mean of positive and negative values. The average Z′-factor was 0.79, and the average r value for duplicate plates was 0.98. We employed a low stringency approach for analysis of the initial screen results to overcome potentially false negative responses produced by any individual siRNA. Higher stringency was invoked during the validation steps. For the initial screen, a target was scored positive if two independent siRNAs caused an appearance of higher than 15% GFP-positive cells in the primary GFP-silent population, or 7.5% in the secondary reporter population. The different cutoff criteria reflect the generally weaker GFP response produced from the LTR promoter versus the CMV promoter. A target was also scored positive if only one independent siRNA fulfilled the criteria in both reporter cell populations. Twenty-eight targets passed the initial criteria and were chosen for validation using a total of four independent siRNAs, which included a fresh set of the initial two siRNA replicates, and two additional independent siRNA replicates. The validation analyses included both the primary and secondary reporter cells. Three independent experiments were carried out, each in duplicate (supplemental Table S1). Raw values (percent GFP-positive cells) for each single siRNA were averaged, and the standard deviation was calculated. The -fold difference relative to the negative control and the significance of change was analyzed with a two-tail t test. The Bonferroni correction was performed to adjust p values for multiple testing. An siRNA was scored as positive if, in the analysis of the primary reporter cell population, the -fold difference was higher than or equal to 10, and the p value was <0.0001. For the secondary reporter cell population with the weaker LTR promoter, an siRNA was scored positive if the -fold difference was higher than or equal to 3 and p was <0.01. Finally, the target was scored a hit if at least two of four siRNAs fulfilled these criteria (supplemental Fig. S1). We also employed a secondary assay to detect siRNAs that could potentially interfere with GFP expression and thereby produce false negative results (supplemental Fig. S4). Overall, 15 out of 28 targets were validated with at least 2 independent siRNAs in one or both cell lines. A survey of published work indicated that proteins corresponding to all 15 validated hits are expressed in HeLa cells (supplemental Table S1). ChIP was performed using the EZ-Magna ChIP kit (Millipore Corp.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For immunoprecipitation procedures, antibodies against H3K9me3 (ab8898) and H4K20me3 (ab9053) from Abcam, and anti-acetyl histone H3 (06–599) and anti-acetyl histone H4 (06–866) from Upstate, were used. Quantification was performed using real-time PCR, with sets of primers for the GAPDH promoter region (sense, 5′-TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG; antisense, 5′-TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA), the GFP CMV promoter (sense, 5′-GCATTATGCCCAGTACATGACCT; antisense, 5′-AAATCCCCGTGAGTCAAACC), and the GFP transcription start site (sense, 5′-TACGGTGGGAGGTCTATATAAGCA; antisense, 5′-CTCGCCCTTGCTCACCAT). Epigenetic drugs such as HDACi and DNMTi relieve epigenetic silencing by inhibiting or depleting enzymes that modify chromatin. siRNA-based knockdown of key silencing regulators would be expected to phenocopy such effects. We described previously a human reporter cell system that can detect functional roles for epigenetic silencing factors using this principle (22Katz R.A. Jack-Scott E. Narezkina A. Palagin I. Boimel P. Kulkosky J. Nicolas E. Greger J.G. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2592-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Poleshko A. Palagin I. Zhang R. Boimel P. Castagna C. Adams P.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2313-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). GFP genes were introduced into HeLa cells using retroviral vectors. Cell populations harboring reversibly silent GFP genes, deposited at dispersed chromosomal locations, were identified and sorted via transient reactivation of the GFP gene using an HDACi. Upon removal of the HDACi, expression of GFP became re-silenced and remained silenced during long term cell passage. Using this GFP-silent cell population, we found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of several factors among a candidate set promoted GFP reactivation (e.g. HDAC1) (23Poleshko A. Palagin I. Zhang R. Boimel P. Castagna C. Adams P.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2313-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These findings indicated that the GFP-silent reporter system was a valid entry point to develop a high throughput, gene-by-gene siRNA screen to detect functional networks of epigenetic silencing factors (Fig. 1). In collaboration with Qiagen Corp., we formulated a comprehensive 200-siRNA set that targets a variety of known and predicted, positive and negative epigenetic regulators, including chromatin-remodeling factors, KATs, HDACs, KMTs, and KDMs (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table S1). The library includes two independent siRNAs for each target gene, and the initial candidates were analyzed further with additional siRNA validation sets. The initial analysis was performed using a multiwell format. Three different GFP-silent reporter cell populations that employ different promoters to drive the silent GFP gene were used (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two independent siRNAs for each epigenetic target were tested, and each plate included positive and negative control siRNAs, HDAC1 and GAPDH, respectively. Wells were treated with siRNAs targeting individual epigenetic regulators, and the percentage of resulting GFP-positive cells appearing after 96 h was measured by FACS. Transfection with only a small subset of siRNAs in the library produced robust GFP reactivation, i.e. in up to 80% of the cells in the well (Fig. 1C). The analysis detected roles for heterochromatin protein 1γ, and HDAC1 among the class I, II, and IV HDAC family members that are targeted by the siRNA set. As these two factors had been identified in our previous candidate study (23Poleshko A. Palagin I. Zhang R. Boimel P. Castagna C. Adams P.D. Skalka A.M. Katz R.A. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2313-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), they were excluded from further analysis. The remaining subset was further evaluated using multiple independent siRNAs, signal to noise criteria, statistical analyses, and testing in independent reporter cell populations (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using several detailed criteria, we validated 15 gene hits (“Experimental Procedures,” Fig. 2, Table 1, supplemental Fig. S1, and supplemental Table S1). Results from analyses of four independent siRNAs per target, with two different reporter cell populations, are shown in Fig. 2. As expected, all of the proteins encoded by the gene hits are present at detectable levels in HeLa cells (supplemental Table S1).TABLE 1Validated hits obtained from screening GFP-silent HeLa reporter cellsProteinsiRNA tests with CMV-GFP reporter cellssiRNA tests with LTR-GFP reporter cellssiRNA tests with EF1α-GFP reporter cellsFunctional classCHAF1A (CAF-1 p150)4/44/4+Histone chaperoneKMT1E (SETDB1)4/44/4−H3K9 histone methyltransferaseTIF1α (TRIM24)3/44/4+TRIM family proteinRAD214/43/4+Cohesin proteinPBRM1 (BAF180)2/42/4+PBAF complexZMYND8 (RACK7)2/42/4−ZF, bromodomain, PHDMBD33/32/3+Methyl binding domain proteinMBD13/42/4+Methyl binding domain proteinRING13/42/4+Polycomb group (PcG) proteinKMT5C (SUV420H2)2/42/4+H4K20 histone methyltransferaseTIF1γ (TRIM33)4/41/4−TRIM family proteinDNMT3A2/40/4−de novo DNA methyltransferaseKDM4A (JMJD2A)2/40/4ntant, not tested.H3K36 histone demethylaseHPH2 (PHC2)3/41/4+Polycomb group (PcG) proteinKDM2A (FBXL11)2/41/4−H3K36 histone demethylasea nt, not tested.

HIF-1 is a heterodimer of two proteins: aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator and the oxygen-regulated HIF-1α. The C-terminal activation domain of HIF-1α has been shown to interact with cysteine/histidine-rich region 1 (CH1) of the coactivator CBP/p300 in a hypoxia-dependent manner. However, HIF forms lacking C-terminal activation domain (naturally occurring or genetically engineered) are still able to activate transcription of target genes in hypoxia. Here, we demonstrate that the N-terminal activation domain (N-TAD) of HIF-1α interacts with endogenous CBP and that this interaction facilitates its transactivation function. Our results show that interaction of HIF-1α N-TAD with CBP/p300 is mediated by the CH3 region of CBP known to interact with, among other factors, p53. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments, we demonstrate that N-TAD interacts with CH3 in vivo. Coimmunoprecipitation assays using endogenous proteins showed that immunoprecipitation of CBP in hypoxia results in the recovery of a larger fraction of HIF-1α than of p53. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that at 1% O2 CBP is recruited to a HIF-1α but not to a p53 target gene. Upon activation of both pathways, lower levels of chromatin-associated CBP were detected at either target gene promoter. These results identify CBP as the coactivator directly interacting with HIF-1α N-TAD and mediating the transactivation function of this domain. Thus, we suggest that in hypoxia HIF-1α is a major CBP-interacting transcription factor that may compete with other CBP-dependent factors, including p53, for limiting amounts of this coactivator, underscoring the complexity in the regulation of gene expression by HIF-1α.

In particular, vesicle budding and fusion constantly take place in various cell membranes to maintain communication and transport between membrane-bound compartments (3Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 175-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Dynamic membrane remodeling involves changes in local membrane curvature (or deformation) that are orchestrated by membrane lipids, integral membrane proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins (4Farsad K.

Despite remarkable success in structural characterization of various BAR and ENTH domains, questions still remain as to whether individual domains function by a universal mechanism or by different mechanisms, whether the intact proteins harboring these domains behave in the same manner as the isolated domains, especially under physiological conditions, and how and when these proteins contribute to endocytosis and other cellular vesicle budding processes.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the ENTH domain was identified through homology searches in a number of proteins involved in the early stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Structural studies have shown that these domains have similar structures despite low sequence similarity (13Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T.

The ENTH domain of AP180/CALM binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) via a cluster of surface basic residues (22Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the ENTH domain of epsin 1, which lacks this basic region, also binds PtdIns(4,5)P2 (23Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the epsin 1-ENTH-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) complex revealed that Ins(1,4,5)P3 induces the formation of an N-terminal amphiphilic α-helix (H0) that constitutes the binding pocket for Ins(1,4,5)P3 (13Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Also, in vitro studies (24Stahelin R.V. Long F.

Lee J.H. Lee J.B. Seo J.H. Kim Y.S. Mol. Cells. 2006; 21: 428-435PubMed Google Scholar) of the epsin 1 ENTH domain indicated that hydrophobic residues on the same face of H0 penetrate the membrane in a PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent manner, which is important for its vesicle tubulation activity. In contrast with the epsin 1 ENTH domain, the ENTH domain of CALM/AP180, which lacks the N-terminal amphiphilic α-helix, does not induce vesicle tubulation. It is thus generally believed that membrane penetration of H0 is essential for the generation of the positive membrane curvature and membrane deformation. For this reason, ENTH domains are often subdivided into ENTH (epsin-like) and ANTH (AP180/CALM-like) domains on the basis of the presence of the N-terminal amphiphilic α-helix (and vesicle-tubulating activity) (13Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). However, there are many proteins with membrane-penetrating amphiphilic α-helices that do not effectively induce membrane deformation, especially under physiological conditions. This raises a question as to how exactly some ENTH domains cause vesicle tubulation in vitro and facilitate vesicle budding during clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study, we have performed biophysical, structural, computational, and cell studies to elucidate the mechanism of vesicle tubulation by the epsin 1 ENTH domain. Results provide evidence for a novel mechanism in which the self-association of the ENTH domain into highly ordered aggregates on the membrane drives the membrane-remodeling activity of epsin 1. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine(POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS), and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-lisamine rhodamine B sulfonyl (Rh-PE) were from Avanti Polar Lipids, and a 1,2-dipalmitoyl derivative of PtdIns(4,5)P2 was from Cayman Chemical. 1-Oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) was from Toronto Research Chemicals. The epsin 1 ENTH domain and mutants were expressed as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and purified using the GST-TagTM resin (Novagen) as described (24Stahelin R.V. Long F.

For EPR measurements, a single Cys at position 96 of epsin 1 ENTH WT was first mutated to Ala, and the C96A mutant was used as a template to introduce single or double Cys mutants. MTSL was then introduced on a single (or double) cysteine site of the ENTH domain WT or its mutants as a spin label. To the protein bound to the GST-TagTM resin, 10 mm dithiothreitol was added to the column to reduce all cysteines and then removed completely with an excess amount of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 160 mm KCl. After 50 mm MTSL was added to the column, the mixture was incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with mild shaking, and free MTSL was removed with 200 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 160 mm KCl. The labeled protein was then cleaved from the resin by thrombin and purified as described (24Stahelin R.V. Long F. Peter B.J. Murray D. De Camilli P. McMahon H.T. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28993-28999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For fluorescent labeling at Cys96, an excess amount of Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide (Invitrogen) was added to a column containing ENTH WT or a mutant, and the mixture was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with mild shaking. The fluorescent labeling efficiency, calculated according to the manufacturer's protocol, was typically 60–80%. POPC, POPE (or POPS), and PtdIns(4,5)P2 in chloroform were mixed with a molar ratio of 77:20:3 and dried under vacuum overnight, and the mixture was resuspended in 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, with 100 mm KCl. Large unilamellar vesicles of 100-nm diameter were prepared from this suspension using an extruder equipped with a polycarbonate filter after >10 cycles of freezing (in the liquid nitrogen) and thawing. The final lipid concentration of vesicle solution was 50 mm. Spin-labeled ENTH wild type and mutants were gently mixed with vesicles at 4 °C for about 30 min. The lipid/protein molar ratio was kept at 200:1. The vesicle-bound proteins were then collected by centrifugation to reach the final protein concentrations of 250–300 μm. Continuous wave EPR spectra were collected using the Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer equipped with a loop-gap resonator (Medical Advances) and a low noise microwave amplifier (Miteq). The modulation amplitude was set at no greater than one-fourth of the line width. Room temperature (293 K) and low temperature (130 K) spectra were obtained. The data were collected in a first derivative mode for the room temperature measurement, whereas data were collected as the absorbance spectra for the low temperature measurement (26Kweon D.H. Chen Y. Zhang F. Poirier M. Kim C.S. Shin Y.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5449-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Kweon D.H. Kim C.S. Shin Y.K. Nat. Struct.

GUVs were prepared by the electroformation technique as described previously (29Bagatolli L.A. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2090-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 30Gokhale N.A. Abraham A. Digman M.A. Gratton E. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42831-42840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The lipid mixtures (POPC/POPE/POPS/PtdIns(4,5)P2/Rh-PE = 46.5:30:20:3:05) were prepared in chloroform/methanol (3:1) at a total concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and then the lipid solution was spread onto the indium tin oxide electrode surface, and the lipid was dried under vacuum to form a uniform lipid film. Vesicles were grown in a sucrose solution (typically 350 mm), whereas an electric field (3 V, 20 Hz frequency) was applied for 5 h at room temperature. The diameter of observed vesicles ranged from 5 to 30 μm. 1–2 μl of sucrose-loaded GUV solution was added into a well glued onto a coverslip that was placed on the stage of the Zeiss 200M microscope. The well contained 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.16 m KCl solution. After GUVs were sedimented in the bottom of the well, proteins were added gently, and the entire well was scanned with an automated x-y stage (2-min scan time) at 37 °C. Images were captured every 5 s with a CCD camera controlled with Metamorph software (Roper Scientific). Rh-PE was excited by an HBO 103 W/2 mercury lamp (Zeiss) with a Chroma D560/40 band pass filter, and the emission signal was monitored with a Chroma D630/60 band pass filter. The focal plane of the ×40 objective was continuously adjusted to obtain clear images of vesicles, and images were collected for up to 30 min. For each captured image, the numbers of total and tubulated GUVs (i.e. ones with buds or tubules) were counted and averaged over the full scan (i.e. 24 images). The percentage of tubulated vesicles was then plotted as a function of time. Alternately, the number of tubules per vesicles was calculated by dividing the total number of tubules and buds by the total number of vesicles and averaging these values over the full scan. All microscopy measurements were carried out at 37 °C using a custom-built combination laser-scanning and multiphoton microscope that was described previously (31Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Medkova M. Ananthanarayanan B. Rafter J.D. Melowic H.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29501-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Instrument control was accomplished with the help of ISS amplifiers, an ISS three-axis scanning card, and two ISS 200-kHz analog lifetime cards. All measurements were controlled and analyzed by the SimFCS. The average size of ENTH domain aggregates and the relative population of each aggregate as a function of time were determined by the number and brightness analysis as described (32Digman M.A. Dalal R. Horwitz A.F. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 2320-2332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) with a variation. To determine the aggregation state, a stack of 100 images of 64 × 64 pixels was collected at a pixel dwell time of 32 μs (see supplemental Fig. S1A). The brightness of each pixel was then determined by the first and second moment analysis of the fluorescence intensity fluctuation at each pixel (see supplemental Fig. S1B). The first and second moment moments of the distribution of photon counts (ki) correspond to the average (〈k〉) and the variance (σ2), respectively. Apparent brightness (B) and number (N) of particles for each pixel, which are defined as the ratio of variance to the average intensity and the ratio of total intensity to B, respectively, were then calculated from the equations, B = σ2/〈k〉 = ϵ + 1 and n = ϵn/(ϵ + 1), where ϵ and n indicate the true brightness and number of particles, respectively. N and B analysis of all pixels then produced two-dimensional maps of B and N (or intensity) (see supplemental Fig. S1C). From these maps, the number of pixels with a given B value was calculated at a given time. For instance, the ENTH domain pentamers have the B value of 1.25 (i.e. ϵ = 0.25) because the control experiment using the ENTH domain in solution showed that the monomer has a B value of 1.05 ± 0.03 (i.e. ϵ = 0.05). The time course of ENTH domain aggregates with different sizes was then determined for about 20 min, while the images of GUV were simultaneously recorded to detect vesicle deformation and tubulation. NIH 3T3 and COS7 cells were seeded into 8-well plates and grown for 16 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fatal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Epsin 1 wild type and K23E/E42K (both C-terminal EGFP-tagged and prepared using the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech)) were transiently expressed by transfection with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in the serum-free DMEM. The medium was replaced with DMEM plus 10% serum after 4 h, and cells were incubated in the incubator for 16 h. Cells transiently expressing wild type and K23E/E42K epsin 1 were rinsed and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 2 h. The Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (Invitrogen; 1 μg/ml final concentration) mixed with the prewarmed serum-free medium was added to cells, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were rinsed with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline twice and then fixed with the ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline twice after 10-min fixation at room temperature. The effect of epsin 1 overexpression on transferrin internalization was monitored by confocal microscopy. For quantification of transferrin endocytosis, the puncta in each cell were counted. The cells with ≥15 transferrin puncta were counted as endocytosed cells, and the percentage of these cells was calculated for WT and mutant-transfected cells, respectively. A dimer model of the ENTH domain was constructed by molecular docking using the FTDOCK program (33Katchalski-Katzir E. Shariv I. Eisenstein M. Friesem A.A. Aflalo C. Vakser I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The total number of rotations performed was 9240 with a grid size set at 218 for Fourier transformation (i.e. a grid cube of 0.70177 Å). The top ranked results from the docking were filtered according to the H0 distance constraints suggested by the EPR analysis, and the best ranked structure was chosen. Side-chain placements were further optimized using a simple gradient descent algorithm. The interaction interface for the dimer was obtained by calculating the solvent-exposed area of the single domain and the complexed domain using the MSMS version 2.6.1 (34Sanner M.F. Olson A.J. Spehner J.C. Biopolymers. 1996; 38: 305-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) algorithm with a probe size of 1.5 Å(surface of complex, 12,928 Å2; surface of single domain, 7190 Å2). Electrostatic calculation was performed using ABPS version 1.0 (35Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5905) Google Scholar) for the native structure and mutants. All equilibrium surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were performed at 23 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl using a lipid-coated L1 chip in the BIACORE X system as described previously (36Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Large unilamellar vesicles of POPC/POPS/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) and POPC were used as the active surface and the control surface, respectively. Sensorgrams were analyzed assuming a Langmuir-type binding between the protein (P) and protein binding sites (M) on vesicles (i.e. P + M ↔ PM) (37Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the Kd value was determined by a nonlinear least-squares analysis (37Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Each data set was repeated three or more times to calculate average and S.D. values. To date, vesicle tubulation activity of proteins has been measured primarily by electron microscopy (38Takei K. Slepnev V.I. Haucke V. De Camilli P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 39Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Although the method provides high resolution images of the tubules generated by proteins, it does not allow continuous kinetic analysis that is necessary for quantitative evaluation and mechanistic investigation. Also, the method requires non-physiologically high concentrations of proteins (i.e. 5–10 μm). We therefore developed a fluorescence microscopy-based vesicle tubulation assay using sucrose-loaded GUV containing a fluorescence-labeled lipid that allows real-time kinetic analysis with submicromolar concentrations of proteins. GUV made of POPC/POPE/POPS/PtdIns(4,5)P2/Rh-PE (46.5:30:20:3:0.5 molar ratio) were stable in the absence of proteins (Fig. 1A) but showed varying degrees of deformation and tubulation in the presence of different proteins. At a given time, 0.5 μm human epsin 1 ENTH domain clearly caused more vesicle deformation (Fig. 1C) than the same concentration of Drosophila amphiphysin BAR domain (Fig. 1B) and another BAR domain from human endophilin (data not shown). Also, the ENTH domain produced more developed tubules, whereas the BAR domains mostly generated small buds. When either the percentage of tubulated vesicles (Fig. 1E) or the number of tubules per vesicle (not shown) was plotted as a function of time, the ENTH domain had 2–3-fold higher activity than BAR domains. The vesicle tubulation activity gradually increased (in terms of both the percentage of tubulated vesicles and the number of tubules/vesicle) with increasing protein concentrations, and above 10 μm, the ENTH and the BAR domains showed comparable tubulation activity. The vesicle tubulation activity of the epsin 1 ENTH domain has been reported (13Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) and ascribed to its membrane-penetrating activity (24Stahelin R.V. Long F. Peter B.J. Murray D. De Camilli P. McMahon H.T. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28993-28999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); however, it is somewhat surprising to find that the ENTH domain can have higher vesicle tubulation activity than the BAR domains despite the lack of the intrinsic molecular curvature that is thought to be important for the vesicle tubulation activity of BAR domains (1McMahon H.T. Gallop J.L. Nature. 2005; 438: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar, 11Dawson J.C. Legg J.A. Machesky L.M.

Science. 2004; 303: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). This suggests that the epsin 1 ENTH domain has unique structural and physical properties that confer novel functionality to this small domain. Although it has been reported that H0 of epsin 1 ENTH domain penetrates the membrane in a PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent manner (13Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R.

Cells. 2006; 21: 428-435PubMed Google Scholar), detailed structural information about the membrane-bound ENTH domains is not available. To understand the mechanism underlying the potent vesicle tubulation activity of the ENTH domain, we thus determined its membrane-docking topology by EPR analysis using a nitroxide scanning strategy. A single Cys at position 96 was first mutated to Ala to generate C96A that showed essentially the same binding activity for POPC/POPS/PtdIns(4,5)P2 (77:20:3) vesicles as wild type (WT) when assayed by SPR analysis (see Table 1). Using C96A as template, each residue in the H0 (residues 5–14) of the ENTH domain was mutated to Cys, and each Cys mutant was modified with a nitroxide spin label MTSL. Since H0 residues are involved in either PtdIns(4,5)P2 coordination (13Ford M.G. Mills I.G. Peter B.J. Vallis Y. Praefcke G.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T.

PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is a proven critical tumor suppressor. We report here that UVB downregulates PTEN in primary human keratinocytes, human HaCaT keratinocytes and mouse skin. As compared with normal skin, PTEN levels are reduced in human actinic keratosis, a precancerous skin lesion caused by solar UV. PTEN downregulation is mediated by two mechanisms: (1) PTEN is cleaved by active caspase in apoptotic cells in which AKT activation is reduced; and (2) PTEN transcription is suppressed in surviving cells, and this suppression is independent of caspase activation and occurs in parallel with increased ERK and AKT activation. We report here that the combination of ERK and AKT activation is crucial for PTEN suppression in surviving cells following UVB irradiation. AKT activation is higher in UVB-irradiated surviving cells as compared with unirradiated cells. The ERK and AKT pathways are involved in sustaining PTEN suppression in UVB-exposed cells. Increasing PTEN expression enhances apoptosis of keratinocytes in response to UVB irradiation. Our findings indicate that (1) UVB radiation suppresses PTEN expression in keratinocytes; and (2) the ERK/AKT/PTEN axis may form a positive feedback loop following UVB irradiation. Our identification of PTEN as a critical molecular target of UVB provides new insights into the pathogenesis of skin cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2036805304,"Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) promotes genomic integrity by excising thymine from mutagenic G·T mismatches arising by deamination of 5-methylcytosine, and follow-on base excision repair enzymes restore a G·C pair. TDG cleaves the N-glycosylic bond of dT and some other nucleotides, including 5-substituted 2′-deoxyuridine analogs, once they have been flipped from the helix into its active site. We examined the role of two strictly conserved residues; Asn140, implicated in the chemical step, and Arg275, implicated in nucleotide flipping. The N140A variant binds substrate DNA with the same tight affinity as wild-type TDG, but it has no detectable base excision activity for a G·T substrate, and its excision rate is vastly diminished (by ∼104.4-fold) for G·U, G·FU, and G·BrU substrates. Thus, Asn140 does not contribute substantially to substrate binding but is essential for the chemical step, where it stabilizes the transition state by ∼6 kcal/mol (compared with 11.6 kcal/mol stabilization provided by TDG overall). Our recent crystal structure revealed that Arg275 penetrates the DNA minor groove, filling the void created by nucleotide flipping. We found that the R275A and R275L substitutions weaken substrate binding and substantially decrease the base excision rate for G·T and G·BrU substrates. Our results indicate that Arg275 promotes and/or stabilizes nucleotide flipping, a role that is most important for target nucleotides that are relatively large (dT and bromodeoxyuridine) and/or have a stable N-glycosylic bond (dT).

IntroductionThe chemically reactive bases in DNA are continuously modified by oxidation, alkylation, and deamination, creating mutagenic and cytotoxic lesions that are implicated in aging and diseases including cancer (1.Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar, 2.Loeb L.A. Christians F.C. Mutat. Res. 1996; 350: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Such damage is handled predominantly by the base excision repair pathway, initiated by one of many damage-specific DNA glycosylases (3.Wilson 3rd, D.M. Bohr V.A. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 544-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These enzymes use a nucleotide flipping mechanism to find damaged bases within the vast excess of normal DNA and cleave the base-sugar (N-glycosylic) bond to release the base, and follow-on base excision repair proteins complete the repair process.Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) 2The abbreviations used are: TDGhuman thymine DNA glycosylaseITCisothermal titration calorimetryMUGmismatch specific uracil glycosylaseTF2′-deoxy-2′-fluoroarabinothymidineUF2′-deoxy-2′-fluoroarabinouridineUDGuracil DNA glycosylaseBrdUbromodeoxyuridineHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyCpGdC-dG dinucleotideFdU5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridinedU2′-deoxyuridinedT2′-deoxythymidineFU5-fluorouracilBrU5-bromouracil. removes thymine from mutagenic G·T mispairs, one of the few glycosylases that removes a normal base from DNA. Consistent with the need to avoid acting upon undamaged DNA, TDG activity is 18,000-fold greater for G·T mispairs relative to A·T pairs (4.Morgan M.T. Bennett M.T. Drohat A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27578-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). TDG is also specific for a particular DNA sequence, exhibiting the highest activity for G·T mispairs (and other lesions) with a 5′-flanking C·G base pair, i.e. damage located in CpG site (4.Morgan M.T. Bennett M.T. Drohat A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27578-27586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5.Wiebauer K. Jiricny J.

Because cytosine methylation in vertebrates occurs selectively at CpG sites, the specificity of TDG indicates its predominant biological substrate is a G·T mispair arising from deamination of 5-methylcytosine (8.Abu M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8739-8744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Cytosine methylation at CpG sites is central for regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability (9.Jones P.A.

Another human DNA glycosylase has specificity for G·T mispairs arising at CpG sites, methyl-binding domain IV (10.Hendrich B. Hardeland U. Ng H.H. Jiricny J. Bird A.

Nevertheless, CpG sites exhibit a disproportionately high frequency of mutations (C → T) in human cancers and genetic disease (13.Cooper D.N. Youssoufian H. Hum. Genet. 1988; 78: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 14.Pfeifer G.P. Mutat. Res. 2000; 450: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 15.Sjöblom T. Jones S. Wood L.D.

Science. 2006; 314: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2814) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that the slow enzymatic turnover of TDG may contribute (16.Waters T.R. Swann P.F. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is raised by reports that TDG may participate in the demethylation of CpG sites by processing G·T mispairs created by active deamination of 5-methylcytosine (17.Métivier R. Gallais R. Tiffoche C. Le Péron C. Jurkowska R.Z. Carmouche R.P. Ibberson D. Barath P. Demay F. Reid G. Benes V. Jeltsch A. Gannon F. Salbert G.

Nature. 2008; 452: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), which would dramatically increase the burden of G·T mispairs. A preliminary report that homozygous knock-out of the TDG gene in mice results in embryonic lethality is consistent with such a role (19.Cortázar D. Kunz C. Saito Y. Steinacher R. Schär P. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 489-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although these findings remain to be substantiated, they underscore the importance of understanding the catalytic mechanism of TDG.TDG is relatively permissive and can remove 5-halogenated uracils (5-fluorouracil, 5-chlorouracil, 5-bromouracil, and 5- iodouracil), many other 5-substituted uracils, 3,N4-ethenocytosine, hypoxanthine, and other damaged bases (see Ref. 4.Morgan M.T.

Nevertheless, comparing the kinetic and binding parameters for a select group of substrates can provide much insight into the catalytic mechanism of TDG (4.Morgan M.T. Bennett M.T. Drohat A.C. J.

We previously observed robust activity for the excision of 5-halogenated uracils, including FU, ClU, and BrU, even from DNA sequence contexts other than CpG, with implications for the catalytic mechanism of TDG and for the cytotoxicity associated with the incorporation of these bases in DNA (4.Morgan M.T.

Focke F. Saito Y. Schuermann D. Lettieri T. Selfridge J. Schär P. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e91Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Detailed studies of the TDG catalytic mechanism should further illuminate its ability to promote the toxicity of FU, a widely used anticancer agent. Toward this end, we have investigated the role of two strictly conserved active site residues of TDG, Asn140 and Arg275.Together, human TDG and the Escherichia coli mismatch-specific uracil DNA glycosylase (MUG, 32% identical) are the most thoroughly characterized members of the TDG-MUG family (5.Wiebauer K.

We investigated the catalytic role of Asn140, which is found in a motif (138GINPG142) that is strictly conserved in TDG-MUG enzymes (25.Pearl L.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 165-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Previous structural and biochemical studies indicate that Asn140 is important, probably for the chemical step (22.Hardeland U.

To address this deficiency, we examined the role of Asn140 by determining the effect of the N140A substitution on substrate binding and the base excision rate for a number of different substrates.All of the DNA glycosylases employ nucleotide flipping to extrude the target nucleotide from the helix and gain access to the damaged base and the scissile N-glycosylic bond (30.Stivers J.T. Jiang Y.L. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2729-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Most glycosylases use a bulky side chain (Asn, Arg, Gln, Leu, or Tyr) to plug the helical space created by nucleotide flipping, although exceptions include 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, which has a Gly at this position (31.Metz A.H. Hollis T. Eichman B.F. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2411-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These “nucleotide flipping” residues can promote forward progress of the target nucleotide toward the active site and/or hinder its reverse flipping back into the helix, increasing its lifetime in the active site (30.Stivers J.T. Jiang Y.L. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2729-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 32.Jiang Y.L. Stivers J.T.

Nature. 2007; 449: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A structure of TDG bound to abasic DNA shows that the Arg275 side chain penetrates the minor groove, plugging the space vacated by the flipped abasic nucleotide and contacting two DNA backbone phosphates that flank the target site (Fig. 1) (29.Maiti A. Morgan M.T. Pozharski E. Drohat A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8890-8895Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although Arg275 is strictly conserved in TDG from vertebrates and lower eukaryotes (19.Cortázar D. Kunz C. Saito Y. Steinacher R. Schär P. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 489-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the closely related MUG enzymes have a Leu in the corresponding position, as do the more distantly related UDG enzymes. We have examined the catalytic role of Arg275 by determining the effect of R275A and R275L substitutions on substrate binding, the base excision rate (kmax), and the binding and release of abasic DNA product.RESULTSOur aim in this work was to probe the catalytic role of two strictly conserved residues of TDG, Asn140 and Arg275, using site-directed mutagenesis, pre-steady-state kinetics, and equilibrium binding experiments. As we and others have shown previously, the steady-state turnover of TDG is severely limited by a step following chemistry, i.e. release of the AP-DNA product (7.Waters T.R. Swann P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20007-20014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21.Fitzgerald M.E. Drohat A.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we used single turnover kinetics experiments under saturating enzyme conditions to determine the effect of Asn140 and Arg275 substitutions on kmax, which reflects the maximal rate of (enzyme-bound) product formation and is not impacted by product release (Fig. 3) (20.Bennett M.T. Rodgers M.T. Hebert A.S. Ruslander L.E. Eisele L. Drohat A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 12510-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3Minimal kinetic mechanism for TDG. The association of enzyme and DNA gives a collision complex (E·S), and nucleotide flipping (involving conformational changes in E and S) gives the reactive enzyme-substrate complex (E′·S′). The chemical step (kchem) involves cleavage of the N-glycosylic bond and addition of the nucleophile (water), giving the product complex (E′·B·P′). Product release involves a conformational change in E and P (not shown) and is slow. Also indicated are the reaction steps that contribute to the kinetic parameters kmax, the maximal rate of product formation, and kcat, the maximal rate of steady-state turnover and to the binding constant (Kd) for substrate (analog).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Essential Role for Asn140We used single turnover kinetics and substrates including G·T, G·U, G·FU, and G·BrU to examine the role of Asn140 in the catalytic mechanism of TDG. We find no evidence of thymine excision from a G·T substrate (0.5 μm) incubated with a saturating concentration of TDG-N140A (10 μm), even after 48 h. The absence of measurable activity is not due to improper folding or instability of the N140A variant, as indicated by results from equilibrium binding studies presented below. Given the high sensitivity of our HPLC assay (20.Bennett M.T. Rodgers M.T. Hebert A.S. Ruslander L.E. Eisele L. Drohat A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 12510-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we can place an upper limit on the activity of TDG-N140A for a G·T substrate, kmax < 7 × 10−6 min−1 (i.e. <1% product in 24 h). Thus, the N140A substitution diminishes the base excision rate by at least 104.4-fold (Table 1). We also examined the single turnover activity of TDG-N140A for other substrates. In contrast to a previous report (22.Hardeland U. Bentele M. Jiricny J. Schär P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33449-33456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), TDG-N140A retains some activity for a G·U substrate, albeit exceedingly low, kmax = 0.00011 ± 0.00001 min−1 (Fig. 4A), revealing a 104.4-fold loss in kmax for the N140A substitution (Table 1). The N140A substitution causes decreases in kmax of 104.4- and 104.1-fold for the G·FU and G·BrU substrates, respectively (Fig. 4 and Table 1). These huge effects on kmax, together with the results of binding studies below, indicate an essential role for Asn140 in the chemical step of the TDG reaction.TABLE 1Results from pre-steady-state kinetics experimentsSubstrateEnzymekmaxFold decrease in kmaxkcatmin−1min−1G·TTDG0.17 ± 0.03N140A<7 × 10−6≥24,300R275A0.021 ± 0.0028R275L0.0057 ± 0.000330G·UTDG2.9 ± 0.30.0045 ± 0.0019N140A0.00011 ± 0.0000127,000R275A1.4 ± 0.220.0056 ± 0.0025R275L1.0 ± 0.130.0049 ± 0.0007G·FUTDG364 ± 30N140A0.016 ± 0.00222,500R275A227 ± 61.6R275L260 ± 61.4G·BrUTDG22 ± 5N140A0.00174 ± 0.0001012,640R275A5.1 ± 0.44R275L1.4 ± 0.216 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Role of Asn140 in base excision.

To determine the binding affinity (Kd) of wild-type TDG to substrate in the absence of base excision, we used DNA containing a 2′-deoxyuridine (dU) analog, UF, which flips into the active site but is resistant to N-glycosylic bond cleavage, as demonstrated previously for human TDG and for MUG and UDG from E. coli (27.Barrett T.E.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, ITC experiments show that TDG binds the G·UF substrate analog with high affinity, Kd = 5 ± 1 nm (Table 2). The binding is endothermic, driven by favorable entropy (TΔS > 0) that compensates for large unfavorable enthalpy (ΔH > 0), consistent with our previous results for TDG binding to abasic DNA product (29.Maiti A. Morgan M.T. Pozharski E. Drohat A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8890-8895Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and with the thermodynamic signature of other proteins that bind the minor groove of DNA (42.Privalov P.L. Dragan A.I. Crane-Robinson C. Breslauer K.J. Remeta D.P. Minetti C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Remarkably, TDG-N140A binds the G·UF substrate analog with nearly the same affinity and thermodynamic parameters as wild-type TDG (Fig. 5 and Table 2). The exceedingly low base excision activity of TDG-N140A allows a determination of its binding affinity for natural substrate in the absence of base excision (i.e. <1% product formation in 2 h at 5 °C). The affinity of TDG-N140A for a natural G·U substrate, Kd = 9 ± 2 nm, is very similar to that observed for TDG-N140A and wild-type TDG binding to the G·UF substrate analog (Fig. 5 and Table 2). Our results are consistent with previous findings that UF is a good mimic of the natural dU substrate (27.Barrett T.E. Schärer O.D. Savva R. Brown T. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H.

TDG binds the G·TF substrate analog with high affinity, Kd = 36 ± 7 nm (Table 2), and the N140A variant binds with the same affinity, Kd = 39 ± 4 nm. These values agree with the Kd = 41 nm reported for TDG binding to a natural G·T substrate, determined from single turnover kinetics experiments collected as a function of TDG concentration (8.Abu M. Waters T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8739-8744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Given the absence of thymine excision activity for TDG-N140A, we determined its binding affinity for a natural G·T substrate, finding Kd = 22 ± 1 nm (Table 2). In addition, TDG-N140A binds the G·BrU substrate with similar affinity (Table 2). Our observations are in contrast with a previous study reporting that TDG-N140A has weaker binding affinity than native TDG for G·U and G·T substrate DNA (22.Hardeland U. Bentele M. Jiricny J. Schär P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33449-33456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Our finding that the N140A substitution halts the chemical step while not altering substrate binding indicates the N140A variant is a useful platform for investigating the role of other residues in substrate binding, as illustrated for Arg275 below. Although the UF analog has been employed in the study of many DNA glycosylases (27.Barrett T.E. Schärer O.D. Savva R. Brown T. Jiricny J. Verdine G.L. Pearl L.H.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), use of the TF analog has not previously been reported for these enzymes. Our finding that the N140A variant binds with similar affinity and thermodynamic parameters to G·T and G·TF (Table 2) indicates that TF is a good mimic of dT and should be useful in future structural and mechanistic studies of TDG and other glycosylases that excise thymine from DNA.Effect of Arg275 Substitutions on Base ExcisionWe used single turnover kinetics experiments to determine the effect of Arg275 substitutions on kmax. For R275A the steric bulk and positive charge (or at least the polarity) of the Arg side chain are both removed (Fig. 1). Some bulk is retained for R275L, but the shapes of the Leu and Arg side chains differ substantially, and Leu is nonpolar. The R275L variant was also chosen because the related MUG and UDG enzymes have strictly conserved Leu residues in the positions corresponding to Arg275 of TDG (25.Pearl L.H. Mutat.

We used several different target nucleotides to probe the contribution of Arg275 to nucleotide flipping and the chemical step of the TDG reaction, which can both impact kmax (Fig. 3) (4.Morgan M.T.

For the G·FU substrate, the R275A and R275L substitutions give very small effects of 1.6- and 1.4-fold, respectively (Table 1). This indicates essentially no effect on the chemical step for the cleavage of FdU, which is relatively small and is rapidly cleaved by TDG, consistent with our previous findings (4.Morgan M.T.

https://openalex.org/W1984554332,"Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents, but corticosteroid insensitivity is a major barrier for the treatment of some chronic inflammatory diseases. Here, we show that hypoxia induces corticosteroid-insensitive inflammation via reduced transcription of histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) in lung epithelial and macrophage cells. HDAC2 mRNA and protein expression was reduced under hypoxic conditions (1% O(2)). Hypoxia enhanced interleukin-1beta-induced interleukin-8 (CXCL8) production in A549 cells and decreased the ability of dexamethasone to suppress the CXCL8 production. Deletion or point mutation studies revealed that binding of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1alpha to a HIF response element at position -320, but not HIF-1beta or HIF-2alpha, results in reduced polymerase II binding at the site, leading to reduced promoter activity of HDAC2. Our results suggest that activation of HIF-1alpha by hypoxia decreases HDAC2 levels, resulting in amplified inflammation and corticosteroid resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2094707734,"Deoxyhypusine synthase, an NAD+-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the first step in the post-translational synthesis of an unusual amino acid, hypusine (Nϵ-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine), in the eukaryotic initiation factor 5A precursor protein. Two putative deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) sequences have been identified in the Leishmania donovani genome, which are present on chromosomes 20: DHSL20 (DHS-like gene from chromosome 20) and DHS34 (DHS from chromosome 34). Although both sequences exhibit an overall conservation of key residues, DHSL20 protein lacks a critical lysine residue, and the recombinant protein showed no DHS activity in vitro. However, DHS34 contains the critical lysine residue, and the recombinant DHS34 effectively catalyzed deoxyhypusine synthesis. Furthermore, in vivo labeling confirmed that hypusination of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A occurs in intact Leishmania parasites. Interestingly, the DHS34 is much longer, with 601 amino acids, compared with the human DHS enzyme (369 amino acids) and contains several unique insertions. To study the physiological role of DHS34 in Leishmania, gene deletion mutations were attempted via targeted gene replacement. However, chromosomal null mutants of DHS34 could only be obtained in the presence of a DHS34-containing episome. The present data provide evidence that DHS34 is essential for L. donovani and that structural differences in the human and leishmanial DHS enzyme may be exploited for designing selective inhibitors against the parasite.

Although both sequences exhibit an overall conservation of key residues, DHSL20 protein lacks a critical lysine residue, and the recombinant protein showed no DHS activity in vitro. However, DHS34 contains the critical lysine residue, and the recombinant DHS34 effectively catalyzed deoxyhypusine synthesis. Furthermore, in vivo labeling confirmed that hypusination of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A occurs in intact Leishmania parasites. Interestingly, the DHS34 is much longer, with 601 amino acids, compared with the human DHS enzyme (369 amino acids) and contains several unique insertions. To study the physiological role of DHS34 in Leishmania, gene deletion mutations were attempted via targeted gene replacement. However, chromosomal null mutants of DHS34 could only be obtained in the presence of a DHS34-containing episome. The present data provide evidence that DHS34 is essential for L. donovani and that structural differences in the human and leishmanial DHS enzyme may be exploited for designing selective inhibitors against the parasite. Leishmania is a protozoan parasite that results in a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from simple cutaneous lesions to the usually fatal visceral form. Leishmania donovani is the major causative agent of the visceral leishmaniasis. Pentavalent antimonials are the standard first line of treatment for leishmaniasis, but due to toxicity and increasing resistance of the present repertoire of drugs (1Sundar S. More D.K. Singh M.K.

The polyamine pathway is one such pathway that has been exploited successfully for antiparasitic chemotherapy (4Müller S. Coombs G.H. Walter R.D.

The enzymes ornithine decarboxylase, adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, and spermidine synthase (SPDS) have been identified as important drug targets (4Müller S. Coombs G.H. Walter R.D. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Spermidine, the final product of the polyamine biosynthetic pathway in kinetoplastids, acts as a precursor for trypanothione (a key molecule in defense against oxidative stress) (5Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) and hypusine (6Park M.H. Cooper H.L. Folk J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Hypusine (Nϵ-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine) is an unusual amino acid named after its two structural components, hydroxyputrescine and lysine (7Shiba T. Mizote H. Kaneko T. Nakajima T. Kakimoto Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 244: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Hypusine synthesis is the result of a post-translational modification occurring exclusively in one cellular protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A), 3The abbreviations used are: eIF5Aeukaryotic initiation factor 5ADHSdeoxyhypusine synthaseORFopen reading frame. by the transfer of the 4-aminobutyl moiety from spermidine to its lysine side chain (8Cooper H.L. Park M.H. Folk J.E. Safer B. Braverman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 1854-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Hypusine formation occurs mainly in two enzymatic steps (9Park M.H. Cooper H.L. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7217-7222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first step is catalyzed by the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS), which catalyzes the NAD+-dependent transfer of the 4-aminobutyl moiety of spermidine to a specific lysine residue of the eIF5A precursor protein to form an intermediate, deoxyhypusine (10Chen K.Y. Dou Q.P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Murphey R.J. Gerner E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15033-15036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This intermediate is subsequently hydroxylated by the enzyme deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (12Abbruzzese A. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol.

DHS has also been suggested as the potential target for antiretroviral therapy (18Hauber I. Bevec D. Heukeshoven J. Krätzer F. Horn F. Choidas A. Harrer T. Hauber J. J. Clin.

Disruption of the two eIF5A genes (TIF51A and TIF51B) (19Schnier J. Schwelberger H.G. Smit-McBride Z. Kang H.A. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell.

It is a highly conserved protein and exists as a single gene product of 300–400 amino acids (33–48 kDa) in most eukaryotes. The native enzymes of human and yeast recombinant proteins exist as a ∼160-kDa molecule, a tetramer of four identical subunits of ∼40 kDa (21Joe Y.A. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. J. Biol.

Crystal structures of the human DHS tetrameric enzyme in complex with a cofactor NAD and its inhibitor have been reported (23Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R.

In the present study, we, for the first time, report the identification, molecular cloning, expression, and characterization of the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase from L. donovani. Two DHS-like genes have been identified in L. donovani, which show low homology with the human DHS. Both genes have been cloned and expressed, but only one, DHS34, exhibits deoxyhypusine synthase activity. Gene replacement studies for DHS34 indicate that the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase and eIF5A modification play an essential role in cell viability of this pathogenic organism. Radiolabeled spermidine trihydrochloride [1,8-3H]spermidine (16.6 Ci/mmol) and radiolabeled [1,4-14C]putrescine (110 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was acquired from Amersham Biosciences. All restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from MBI Fermentas (Germany). Neomycin, phleomycin, and hygromycin were obtained from Sigma. N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane was synthesized as described earlier (14Jakus J. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13151-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human DHS was purified from Escherichia coli cells as reported earlier (21Joe Y.A. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22386-22392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The other materials used in this study were of analytical grade and were commercially available. L. donovani AG83 (MHOM/IN/1983/AG83) promastigotes were cultured at 22 °C in modified M199 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin (Sigma), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The genetically manipulated parasites were derived from the wild type LdBob strain of L. donovani (25Goyard S. Segawa H. Gordon J. Showalter M. Duncan R. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) that was originally obtained from Dr. Stephen Beverley (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). LdBob promastigotes and axenic amastigotes were routinely cultivated at 28 °C, pH 7.4, and 37 °C, pH 5.5, respectively, in the culture media previously reported (25Goyard S. Segawa H. Gordon J. Showalter M. Duncan R. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Boitz J.M. Yates P.A. Kline C. Gaur U. Wilson M.E. Ullman B. Roberts S.C. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All parasite strains were cycled back and forth between the promastigote and axenic amastigote forms. Wild type parasites were routinely cultured in media with no drug supplementations, whereas the DHS heterozygotes were maintained in either 50 μg/ml hygromycin (DHS34/HYG::dhs) or 50 μg/ml phleomycin (DHS34/PHLEO::dhs). The DHS34/HYG::dhs strain containing the pX63PAC-DHS episome was grown in 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 20 μm puromycin, and the putative Δdhs34[pX63PAC-DHS34] clones were kept in 50 μg/ml hygromycin, 50 μg/ml phleomycin, and 20 μm puromycin. A 1.14-kb DNA fragment encompassing the whole open reading frame (ORF) of the L. donovani DHS-like-gene DHSL20 was amplified from genomic DNA using a sense primer with a flanking BamHI site, 5′-CGCGGATCCATGCTTGCCTCTGTCCCAG-3′ and an antisense primer with a flanking HindIII site, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCGGCGCTCTGCGCTAC-3′. A 1.8-kb DNA fragment encompassing the whole ORF of the L. donovani DHS34 gene was also amplified from genomic DNA using the sense primer with a flanking BamHI site, 5′-CGGGATCCATGGCGAATATTGCGGAATC-3′, and the antisense primer with the flanking HindIII site, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGAGTGCCCGGAGACGTCTTG-3′. PCR was performed in 50-μl reaction volumes containing 100 ng of genomic DNA, 25 pmol each of the gene-specific forward and reverse primers, 200 μm each of dNTPs, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas). The conditions of the PCR were as follows: 94 °C for 10 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min for DHSL20 and 72 °C for 3 min for DHS34. Final extension was carried out for 10 min at 72 °C. A single ∼1140-bp (DHSL20) and 1806-bp (DHS34) PCR products were obtained. Each gene was then cloned into the pTZ57R/T (MBI Fermentas) vector and sequenced. Sequence comparison of DHSL20 and DHS34 with other sequences of the data base was done using the search algorithm BLAST (available on the NCBI Web site). Multiple alignment of amino acid sequences was performed using the program ClustalW (available on the World Wide Web) The bootstrap analysis was done and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the software MEGA version 4.0 (27Tamura K. Dudley J. Nei M. Kumar S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25632) Google Scholar). DHSL20 and DHS34 protein sequences were searched against the multiple position-specific substitution matrix data base (MulPSSM) (28Gowri V.S. Krishnadev O. Swamy C.S. Srinivasan N.

Local alignments of DHS34 and DHSL20 protein were compared with human DHS to analyze the conservation of important amino acid residues. Subsequently, DHS34 was searched against the Protein Data Bank (31Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27935) Google Scholar) using the BLAST program (32Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

The DHS34 protein sequence was modeled on the basis of the tertiary structure of the human DHS template (Protein Data Bank code 1dhs) (23Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using MODELLER version 8.0 (available on the World Wide Web) (33Sali A. Mol. Med. Today. 1995; 1: 270-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The generated model was energy-minimized using Kollman united atom forced field in SYBYL (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) to relieve short contacts if any. The overall fit of the sequence to the modeled structure was checked using PROSA (34Wiederstein M. Sippl M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W407-W410Crossref PubMed Scopus (3579) Google Scholar, 35Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of the models was evaluated using PROCHECK (36Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar, 37Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The coding regions of the DHSL20 gene and DHS34 gene were subcloned into the BamHI-HindIII site of pET30a vector (Novagen). The fidelity of the PCR amplification of L. donovani DHSL20 and DHS34 was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The recombinant constructs were transformed into the BL21 (DE3) strain of E. coli. Expression from the constructs DHSL20-pET30a and DHS34-pET30a was induced at an A600 of 0.6 with 0.25 mm isopropyl-1-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C for 12 h. Bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, 300 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). The resulting cell suspension was sonicated six times for 30 s with 1-min intervals. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant, which contained the protein, was loaded onto pre-equilibrated Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic-agarose resin (Qiagen). The mixture was kept on a rocking platform for 2 h at 4 °C. It was centrifuged at 400 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the resin was washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). The protein was eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole. Imidazole was removed, and the purified protein was found to be >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. The purified protein was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl buffer. Deoxyhypusine synthase activity was assayed by measuring incorporation of radioactivity from [1,8-3H]spermidine into L. donovani eIF5A (accession number ABO34138.1) precursor protein (38Park M.H. Wolff E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15264-15269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical reaction mixture contained, in a total volume of 50 μl, 0.2 m glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 9.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NAD, 200 μg of bovine serum albumin, ∼5 μm (4 μCi) [1,8-3H]spermidine, 5 μm eIF5A, and the indicated amount of recombinant DHS. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction mixture was terminated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid containing putrescine, spermidine, and spermine (1 mm each). The samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The precipitate obtained was washed repeatedly with 10% trichloroacetic acid containing polyamines to remove the [3H]spermidine bound to the pellet. The [3H]deoxyhypusine formed was measured by dissolving the pellet in 100 μl of 0.1 n NaOH, and the counts were taken. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of one pmol/h of deoxyhypusine. Deoxyhypusine formation was also confirmed by detection of radiolabeled eIF5A by fluorography after SDS-PAGE. Wild type and spermidine synthase-deficient (Δspdsyn) parasites (40Roberts S.C. Jiang Y. Jardim A. Carter N.S. Heby O. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were incubated in growth medium containing radiolabeled [1,4-14C]putrescine and 100 μm unlabeled spermidine for 4 days. Subsequently, parasites were harvested and sonicated, and lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and subsequently dried and exposed for autoradiography. To construct drug resistance cassettes for targeted DHS34 gene replacement, the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of DHS34 were amplified by PCR. The 5′-flank was amplified using genomic DNA as a template and the following primers: AAGCTTCCAGAGTACACTGGATAGGC (HindIII site underlined) and GTCGACTCTCTTGTCTCACCGCC (SalI site underlined). The 423-bp 5′-flanking region was then cloned into the HindIII/SalI sites of pX63HYG to generate pX63HYG-5′DHS34. The 3′-flank was amplified using the following primer pair: CCCGGGGGAGTGGGCTGGTGGCG (SmaI site underlined) and AGATCTCGCGCCGCAACCTCGTAAAAG (BglII site underlined). The 584-bp 3′-flanking region was cloned into the SmaI/BglII site of pX63HYG-5′DHS34 to generate the pX63HYGΔdhs34 gene replacement construct. The same 5′-flank was cloned into the HindIII/SalI sites of the pX63PHLEO vector to generate pX63PHLEO-5′DHS34. Because of the presence of a SmaI site within the coding region of PHLEO, a different strategy was employed to insert the DHS34 3′-flanking region into the pX63PHLEO-5′DHS34. For the generation of the 3′-flanking fragment, the following primers were used: GGATCCGGAGTGGGCTGGTGGCG (BamHI underlined) and AGATCTCGCGCCGCAACCTCGTAAAAG (BglII underlined) to generate a 580-bp PCR fragment. The fragment was cloned into pX63PHLEO-5′DHS34 to generate the gene replacement construct pX63PHLEOΔdhs34. PCRs were performed using the AdvantageTM PCR kit (BD) at the following conditions: 94 °C for 10 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Restriction mapping and limited nucleotide sequence analysis was used to confirm the correct orientation of the 5′ and 3′ DHS34 flanking region within the pX63HYGΔdhs34 and pX63PHLEOΔdhs34 vectors. To generate the pX63PAC-DHS34 complementation construct, the following primers were used to amplify the DHS34 coding region by PCR: GGATCCATGGCGAATATTGCGGAATCTG (BamHI site underlined) and AGATCTTCATTCTCCAAGACACGGGTGG (BglII site underlined). PCRs were performed using the high fidelity HFAdvantageTM PCR kit (BD Biosciences) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 10 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The 1.8-kb BamHI-BglII fragment was subcloned into the BamHI/BglII sites of pX63PAC. The correct orientation and sequence fidelity of the insert was verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. The pX63HYGΔdhs34 and pX63PHLEOΔdhs34 plasmids were digested with HindIII and BglII to liberate the deletion fragments containing the drug resistance cassette and DHS34 flanking regions (designated HYGΔdhs34 and PHLEOΔdhs34). These fragments were gel-purified and transfected into wild type LdBob parasites according to standard protocols (26Boitz J.M. Yates P.A. Kline C. Gaur U. Wilson M.E. Ullman B. Roberts S.C. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 41Robinson K.A. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 128: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The HYGΔdhs34 and PHLEOΔdhs34 gene replacement cassettes were individually transfected into wild type parasites, and colonies were selected from semisolid agar plates in the presence of 50 μg/ml hygromycin or 50 μg/ml phleomycin, respectively. The genotype of the putative heterozygous parasites, DHS34/HYG::dhs34 and DHS34/PHLEO::dhs34, was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions as probes. The growth phenotype of heterozygous parasites was established by seeding 2 × 105 cells/ml, and parasites were counted after 4 days on a hemocytometer. The heterozygous parasites, DHS34/HYG::dhs34 and DHS34/PHLEO::dhs34, were subsequently transfected with the PHLEOΔdhs34 and HYGΔdhs34 replacement cassettes, respectively, in an attempt to generate homozygous gene deletion mutants. Colonies were selected on semisolid agar plates containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 50 μg/ml phleomycin, and parasite genotypes were established by Southern blotting. The pX63PAC-DHS34 episome was transfected into DHS34/HYG::dhs34 heterozygous parasites, and parasites containing the plasmid were selected in 20 μm puromycin. These DHS34/HYG::dhs34[pX63PAC-DHS34] parasites were subsequently transfected with the purified PHLEOΔdhs34 gene replacement construct, and colonies were selected on semisolid agar plates containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin, 20 μm puromycin, and 50 μg/ml phleomycin to isolate triple drug-resistant parasites. The genotypes of several clones were established by Southern blotting. Genomic DNA from wild type and genetically manipulated parasites was prepared for Southern blot and PCR analysis using the DNAeasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). DNA was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and probed with either 5′- or 3′-flanking regions or the DHS34 coding region probe using highly stringent hybridization conditions. Furthermore, a PCR strategy was devised to confirm the results obtained by Southern blotting. The following primers were designed to amplify DNA fragments within the DHS34 coding region: the top primer 1 (ATGGCGAATATTGCGGAGTCT) and the bottom primers 7 (CAACACCCTCCTGCACAAGAA), 8 (GGCGTAGTAGTGCAGTGTG), and 10 (CACAGCCCTCAGCGCCTGCGC). Another set of primers was designed to amplify a fragment spanning from the 5′-flanking region into the coding region, the top primers 2 (cctcagtctgctatgctccc) and 4 (agaaagagcgatgtcgttgcctc) to hybridize to the 5′-flanking region, and the bottom primers 5 (cagattccgcaatattcgcCAT) and 6 (caccctcctgcacaagaaagcg) to hybridize to the DHS34 coding region. PCRs were performed using the AdvantageTM PCR kit (BD Biosciences) at the following conditions: 94 °C for 10 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Two DHS sequences have been identified in each of the Leishmania infantum and Leishmania major genomes (see the EMBL-EBI Web site). Two DHS-like sequences have also been identified in the Trypanosoma brucei (Tb927.1.870 and Tb10.70.4900) and Trypanosoma cruzi genomes (Tc00.1047053511421.60 and Tc00.1047053504119.29), whereas most other organisms have only one DHS gene copy. BLAST analysis of L. major and L. infantum genomes revealed that the deoxyhypusine synthase-encoding genes are present on chromosomes 20 (DHSL20) and 34 (DHS34). Southern blot analysis of the DHSL20 and DHS34 showed that these were single copy genes (data not shown). Sequence analysis, data base search, and alignment of the L. donovani DHSL20 and DHS34 amino acid sequences were performed. The DHSL20 amino acid sequence had a single open reading frame consisting of 1140 bp (L. donovani DHS, EF512031). The ORF encoded a putative polypeptide of 379 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of ∼42 kDa. Amino acid sequence alignment of DHSL20 protein with homologous sequences from other species revealed that it shares 63.4% identity with the T. cruzi (Tc00.1047053511421.60), 56.1% identity with T. brucei (Tb927.1.870), and 30.7% with S. cerevisiae (P38791) proteins (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we proceeded with the characterization of DHS34, which is located on chromosome 34. The sequence identity between DHSL20 protein and DHS34 is only 21.7%. A single open reading frame consisting of 1806 bp was identified (L. donovani DHS, EU864544). The ORF encoded a putative polypeptide of 601 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of ∼66 kDa. Amino acid sequence alignment of DHS34 with homologous sequences from other species revealed that it is 46.5% identical to T. cruzi (Tc00.1047053504119.29), 45% with T. brucei (Tb10.70.4900), and 33.3% with S. cerevisiae (P38791). Interestingly, DHSL20 protein has closer identity with the T. brucei (56.1%) and T. cruzi genes (63.4%) compared with DHS34 (45% with T. brucei and 46.5% with T. cruzi). Alignment of DHSL20 and DHS34 protein with the human DHS (P49366) shows conservation of important residues, which are essential for the overall functioning of the enzyme (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). The leishmanial DHS34 and DHSL20 protein share 32.8% (Fig. 2) and 34.7% (Fig. 1) sequence identity with the human DHS sequence, respectively. Interestingly, although the DHSL20 protein with 379 amino acid residues is of similar length as the human enzyme, the DHS34 is much longer with 601 amino acids. Alignment of DHS34 with the human DHS shows that there is a big insertion in DHS34 from residue 130 to 354 (Fig. 3). No homologs were found for this region using standard homology detection methods like PSI-BLAST. A reverse transcriptase PCR on DHS34 (parasite RNA as template) confirmed that the entire gene (with all insertions) was transcribed (data not shown). The residues that have been identified as important for NAD+ binding in the human DHS, Asn106, Asp238, His288, and Asp313, are conserved in DHS34 (42Lee C.H. Um P.Y. Park M.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Residues equivalent to human DHS, His288, Trp327, Lys329, Asp316, and Glu323, which participate in spermidine binding and reaction mechanism, are also conserved (23Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H.

https://openalex.org/W1993322011,"Modulation of K(+) conductance of the inner mitochondrial membrane has been proposed to mediate preconditioning in ischemia-reperfusion injury. The mechanism is not entirely understood, but it has been linked to a decreased activation of mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT). In the present study K(+) channel activity was mimicked by picomolar concentrations of valinomycin. Isolated brain mitochondria were exposed to continuous infusions of calcium. Monitoring of extramitochondrial Ca(2+) and mitochondrial respiration provided a quantitative assay for mPT sensitivity by determining calcium retention capacity (CRC). Valinomycin and cyclophilin D inhibition separately and additively increased CRC. Comparable degrees of respiratory uncoupling induced by increased K(+) or H(+) conductance had opposite effects on mPT sensitivity. Protonophores dose-dependently decreased CRC, demonstrating that so-called mild uncoupling was not beneficial per se. The putative mitoK(ATP) channel opener diazoxide did not mimic the effect of valinomycin. An alkaline matrix pH was required for mitochondria to retain calcium, but increased K(+) conductance did not result in augmented DeltapH. The beneficial effect of valinomycin on CRC was not mediated by H(2)O(2)-induced protein kinase Cepsilon activation. Rather, increased K(+) conductance reduced H(2)O(2) generation during calcium infusion. Lowering the osmolarity of the buffer induced an increase in mitochondrial volume and improved CRC similar to valinomycin without inducing uncoupling or otherwise affecting respiration. We propose that increased potassium conductance in brain mitochondria may cause a direct physiological effect on matrix volume inducing resistance to pathological calcium challenges."
https://openalex.org/W1969049846,"Persistent dysregulation in Ca2+ homeostasis is a pervasive pathogenic mechanism in most neurodegenerative diseases, and accordingly, calpain activation has been implicated in neuronal cells dysfunction and death. In this study we examined the intracellular functional state of the calpain-calpastatin system in −G93A(+) SOD1 transgenic mice to establish if and how uncontrolled activation of calpain can be prevented in vivo during the course of prolonged [Ca2+]i elevation. The presented data indicate that 1) calpain activation is more extensive in motor cortex, in lumbar, and sacral spinal cord segments compared with the lower or almost undetectable activation of the protease in other brain areas, 2) direct measurements of the variations of Ca2+ levels established that the degree of the protease activation is correlated to the extent of elevation of [Ca2+]i, 3) intracellular activation of calpain is always associated with diffusion of calpastatin from perinuclear aggregated forms into the cytosol and the formation of a calpain-calpastatin complex, and 4) a conservative fragmentation of calpastatin is accompanied by its increased expression and inhibitory capacity in conditions of prolonged increase in [Ca2+]i. Thus, calpastatin diffusion and formation of the calpain-calpastatin complex together with an increased synthesis of the inhibitor protein represent a cellular defense response to conditions of prolonged dysregulation in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Altogether these findings provide a new understanding of the in vivo molecular mechanisms governing calpain activation that can be extended to many neurodegenerative diseases, potentially useful for the development of new therapeutic approaches.

Altogether these findings provide a new understanding of the in vivo molecular mechanisms governing calpain activation that can be extended to many neurodegenerative diseases, potentially useful for the development of new therapeutic approaches. An increasing number of reports have indicated that calpain activity exerts a vital physiological role in several neuronal functions (1Wu H.Y. Lynch D.R. Mol.

However, several questions must still be precisely defined particularly because it has also been established that calpain activity can undergo a transition from physiological to pathological function and that this condition occurs in most neurodegenerative diseases due to a dysregulation in Ca2+ homeostasis (1Wu H.Y.

However, to reconcile regulation of calpain both in physiological and pathological conditions to the inhibitory capacity of calpastatin, it seemed necessary to explore additional pertinent topics. These include the observation that Ca2+-mediated activation of calpain occurs also in cells in which calpastatin is in large excess over the protease (2Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol.

Moreover, it has been established that calpastatin normally present in perinuclear aggregates diffuses into cytosol, becoming available for the association with calpain upon elevation of Ca2+ (9Averna M.

Furthermore, the experimental procedure involved the simultaneous analysis of both calpain activation and the intervening changes in the functional properties of the calpain-calpastatin system. Activation of the protease was assessed by determining its consumption and substrate degradation, whereas immunofluorescence analysis was carried out to identify both cellular calpastatin localization and formation of a binary enzyme-inhibitor complex. Our findings confirmed that prolonged dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis occurs in specific brain areas of transgenic mice with an intensity correlated to the extent of calpain activation. These findings were significantly evident in motor cortex, lumbar and sacral segments of spinal cord as well as in skeletal muscle. We also demonstrate that calpain activation was counteracted by a multistep sequential mechanism involving a diffusion of calpastatin in cytosol to generate a complex with calpain, a conservative degradation of the inhibitor producing still active fragments, and a large increase in the synthesis of calpastatin mRNA. superoxide dismutase phosphate-buffered saline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase neuronal nitric-oxide synthase monoclonal antibody. 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride was obtained from Calbiochem.

https://openalex.org/W2077097960,"The apoptosis gateway protein Bax normally exists in the cytosol as a globular shaped monomer composed of nine alpha-helices. During apoptosis, Bax translocates to the mitochondria, forms homo-oligomers, and subsequently induces mitochondrial damage. The mechanism of Bax mitochondrial translocation remains unclear. Among the nine alpha-helices of Bax, helices 4, 5, 6, and 9 are capable of targeting a heterologous protein to mitochondria. However, only helices 6 and 9 can independently direct the oligomerized Bax to the mitochondria. Although Bax mitochondrial translocation can still proceed with mutations in either helix 6 or helix 9, combined mutations completely abolished mitochondrial targeting in response to activating signals. Using a proline mutagenesis scanning analysis, we demonstrated that conformational changes were sufficient to cause Bax to move from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Moreover, we found that homo-oligomerization of Bax contributed to its mitochondrial translocation. These results suggest that Bax is targeted to the mitochondria through the exposure of one or both of the two functional mitochondrial targeting sequences in a conformational change-driven and homo-oligomerization-aided process."

Here, we identify STRAP as an interacting partner of ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1). The association between ASK1 and STRAP is mediated through the C-terminal domain of ASK1 and the fourth and sixth WD40 repeats of STRAP. Using cysteine-to-serine amino acid substitution mutants of ASK1 (C1005S, C1351S, C1360S, and C1351S/C1360S) and STRAP (C152S, C270S, and C152S/C270S), we demonstrated that Cys1351 and Cys1360 of ASK1 and Cys152 and Cys270 of STRAP are required for ASK1-STRAP binding. ASK1 phosphorylated STRAP at Thr175 and Ser179, suggesting a potential role for STRAP phosphorylation in ASK1 activity regulation. Expression of wild-type STRAP, but not STRAP mutants (C152S/C270S and T175A/S179A), inhibited ASK1-mediated signaling to both JNK and p38 kinases by stabilizing complex formation between ASK1 and its negative regulators, thioredoxin and 14-3-3, or decreasing complex formation between ASK1 and its substrate MKK3. In addition, STRAP suppressed H2O2-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner by inhibiting ASK1 activity through direct interaction.

In the present study, we found that STRAP, an ASK1-interacting partner, may play an important role in the regulation of the ASK1-mediated signaling pathway, in which it acts as a negative regulator of ASK1 activity by stabilizing complex formation between ASK1 and Trx or 14-3-3. We also demonstrated that ASK1 phosphorylates STRAP at Thr175 and Ser179 within a region between the WD4 and WD5 domains, which subsequently leads to ASK1 activity inhibition. Moreover, this association suppressed JNK-mediated transactivation and H2O2-induced apoptosis.

Inducible STRAP shRNA stable clones were screened in the presence of 450 μg/ml G418 for 14 days until all control parental HEK293 cells had died. To confirm the knockdown of endogenous STRAP, stable clones were isolated, treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma), a tetracycline analogue, for 72 h, and subjected to Western blotting by anti-STRAP antibody. STRAP mutants were generated by PCR as described previously (11Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34541-34553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, wild-type STRAP was used as the template for amplification with either the STRAP forward T3 5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAG-3′ or reverse M13 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′ primer, in conjunction with one of the following mutant primers containing alterations in the nucleotide sequence of STRAP: for T175A/S179A, forward (5′-GATCATGCTACTATGGCAGAAGTGAAAGCTCTAAATTTTAATATG-3′) and reverse (5′-CATATTAAAATTTAGAGCTTTCACTTCTGCCATAGTAGCATGATC-3′); for T201A/S205A, forward (5′-GAGATTTTGGTTATAGCTTATGGACGAGCTATTGCTTTTCATAGT-3′) and reverse (5′-ACTATGAAAAGCAATAGCTCGTCCATAAGCTATAACCAAAATCTC-3′); for S284A/T288A, forward (5′-CTCTATGCCAGTGGTGCAGAAGATGGAGCATTGAGACTATGGCAA-3′) and reverse (5′-TTGCCATAGTCTCAATGCTCCATCTTCTGCACCACTGGCATAGAG-3′).

A third round of PCR amplification was then performed using STRAP forward T3 and reverse M13 primers and the following parameters: 2 min at 95 °C, 1 cycle; 20 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 50 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, 18 cycles. To generate GST-tagged recombinant proteins for ASK1-C mutants (C1351S, C1360S, and C1351S/C1360S), amplified PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). PCR was performed using FLAG-tagged wild-type ASK1 as the template. The following primers were used: ASK1-C forward primer (5′-GCGAATTCTCAAGCAAAAAGAAAAAG-3′) containing an EcoRI site (underlined), ASK1-C reverse primer (5′-GCCTCGAGTCAAGTCTGTTTGTTTCG-3′) containing an XhoI site (underlined), in conjunction with one of the following mutant primers containing alterations in the nucleotide sequence of ASK1: for C1005S, forward (5′-GCCAAGTCCTCAGGAGAAAGA-3′) and reverse (5′-TCTTTCTCCTGAGGACTTGGC-3′); for C1351S, forward (5′-GACTTAAAATCATTGAGACTA-3′) and reverse (5′-TAGTCTCAATGATTTTAAGTC-3′); for C1360S, forward (5′-GGGATGCTGTCAACACTGTGG-3′), reverse (5′-CCACAGTGTTGACAGCATCCC-3′). To generate the C1351S/C1360S mutant, pGEX4T-1-C1351S was used as the template, and the C1360S forward and reverse primers were used for PCR amplification.

In vivo binding assays were performed as previously described using HEK293, NIH 3T3, or HeLa cells transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors (11Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol.

To determine the direct interaction between ASK1 and STRAP, a GST pull-down assay was also performed using recombinant ASK1 and STRAP proteins as described (27Garg S. Alam M.S. Bajpai R. Kishan K.R. Agrawal P. BMC Biochem. 2009; 10: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Native PAGE for determining the in vitro binding between ASK1 and STRAP was performed using in vitro-translated 35S-labeled STRAP, prepared with the TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) as described previously (23Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35293-35307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or autophosphorylated ASK1, prepared in the presence of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm MgCl2) containing 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.2 mCi/ml). Assays were performed as described earlier (14Park H.S. Cho S.G. Kim C.K. Hwang H.S. Noh K.T. Kim M.S. Huh S.H. Kim M.J. Ryoo K. Kim E.K. Kang W.J. Lee J.S. Seo J.S. Ko Y.G. Kim S. Choi E.J. Mol.

Briefly, the cleared lysates from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors were subjected to immunoprecipitation with appropriate antibodies. After washing the immunoprecipitate three times with lysis buffer and then twice with each kinase buffer (11Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34541-34553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the immunoprecipitates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of each kinase buffer containing 5 μg of recombinant GST-tagged substrates. The reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected by autoradiography. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with GST-tagged JNK, along with the indicated expression vectors, and solubilized with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.3 m NaCl). The cleared lysates were precipitated by glutathione-Sepharose beads. The GST precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm MgCl2) and then subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant c-Jun as a substrate in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. RNA interference experiments were performed as described previously (21Seong H.A. Jung H. Choi H.S. Kim K.T. Ha H. J. Biol.

The STRAP-specific siRNA (number 515) of the oligonucleotides (5′-UUACGCAUAUAUGACUUGA-3′) targeting a coding region (aa 124–129) on human STRAP (GenBankTM accession number BC000162) was used for transfection experiments. The ASK1-specific siRNA (5′-GGUAUACAUGAGUGGAAUUTT-3′) was described previously (11Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34541-34553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression and AP-1-Luc reporter vectors by WelFect-ExTM Plus reagent (WelGENE, Daegu, Korea). After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured by a luciferase assay system (Promega). The total DNA concentration was kept constant by supplementation with empty vector DNAs. The values were adjusted relative to the expression levels of a cotransfected β-galactosidase reporter control. For each experiment, at least three independent transfections were performed. Apoptosis experiments were performed as described previously using the green fluorescent protein system and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining in HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated expression vectors (11Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34541-34553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells exposed to 1 mm H2O2 for 9 h were used as a positive control. All values are represented as the means ± S.E. A p value relative to control of <0.05, as calculated by Student's t test, was considered statistically significant. Given that Akt, a downstream target of PDK1, inhibits signaling downstream of ASK1 through direct interaction and phosphorylation (16Kim A.H. Khursigara G. Sun X. Franke T.F. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), it is possible that PDK1 is associated with ASK1-mediated signaling. Therefore, we reasoned that STRAP, which was previously identified as a positive regulator of PDK1 (21Seong H.A. Jung H. Choi H.S. Kim K.T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), might be involved in the regulation of ASK1-mediated signaling. To determine whether STRAP can be a potential modulator for ASK1 in cells, we initially employed an inducible STRAP-specific shRNA system to investigate the effect of STRAP on ASK1 function. Knockdown of endogenous STRAP significantly increased signaling downstream of ASK1 as determined by immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-specific antibodies for ASK1 Thr845, MKK3/6, p38, and ATF2 (Fig. 1A, left). As expected, an opposite trend was clearly observed in a stable system for tetracycline-inducible expression of STRAP-specific shRNA when we assessed the effect of STRAP on PDK1-mediated signaling (Fig. 1A, right). These results suggest that STRAP can act as an intermediating molecule linking PDK1- and ASK1-mediated signaling. To test whether STRAP is physically associated with ASK1 in cells, we performed cotransfection experiments using GST-STRAP and FLAG-ASK1. ASK1 was detected in the GST precipitate only when coexpressed with GST-STRAP and not with control GST alone, demonstrating that STRAP physically interacts with ASK1 (Fig. 1B, left). We also analyzed the direct association of purified, recombinant ASK1 with STRAP using a GST pull-down assay. ASK1 was found to be associated with STRAP in vitro (supplemental Fig. S1). To confirm the endogenous interaction between ASK1 and STRAP, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments in NIH 3T3, HEK293, and HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous STRAP by an anti-STRAP antibody and then immunoblotting with an anti-ASK1 antibody clearly revealed an interaction between the two endogenous ASK1 and STRAP proteins (Fig. 1B, middle). However, the kinase activity of ASK1 had no effect on the association between ASK1 and STRAP (Fig. 1B, right). These results indicate that ASK1 binds to STRAP in cells. We examined whether H2O2, a stimulator of ASK1, can influence the ASK1-STRAP complex formation in HEK293 and NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). Cells were incubated in media with or without 2 mm H2O2 for 30 min. Endogenous STRAP was immunoprecipitated by anti-STRAP antibody, and the presence of ASK1 was then determined by anti-ASK1 immunoblotting. ASK1-STRAP complex formation was significantly decreased by H2O2 treatment compared with untreated control (Fig. 2, first panel). Similarly, the endogenous interaction of ASK1 with STRAP appeared to be decreased by other ASK1 stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor-α, endoplasmic reticulum stress (thapsigargin), and calcium overload (ionomycin) (Fig. 2, second through fourth panels), suggesting the involvement of STRAP in the ASK1 signaling pathway. We first performed in vivo binding assays to determine which ASK1 domain(s) contributes to STRAP binding. The C-terminal regulatory domain (ASK1-C, aa 941–1375) of ASK1 was found to be responsible for STRAP binding, whereas the N-terminal (ASK1-N, aa 1–648) and kinase (ASK1-K, aa 649–940) domains were unable to bind with STRAP (Fig. 3A, lower left), indicating that ASK1 physically interacts with STRAP through its C-terminal regulatory domain.FIGURE 3Mapping of the ASK1 and STRAP interaction domains. A and C, schematic structures of wild-type and deletion constructs of ASK1 (A, top) and STRAP (C, top). The numbers indicate the amino acid residues corresponding to the domain boundaries. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors were lysed and then precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GST Purification) or immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-HA antibody (α-HA) and immunoblotted (WB) with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody to determine the level of ASK1-STRAP complex formation.

HEK293 cells, transfected with the expression vectors indicated, were lysed, and the GST precipitates were analyzed for complex formation between ASK1 and STRAP by immunoblot analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody (left). For native PAGE (8%) of the ASK1-STRAP complex, in vitro-translated 35S-labeled STRAP was incubated with unlabeled recombinant wild-type and mutant forms of ASK1-C at room temperature for 1 h (right). D, effect of STRAP and its substitution mutants (C152S, C270S, or C152S/C270S) on ASK1-STRAP complex formation. Complex formation between ASK1 and STRAP was analyzed by immunoblot analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody as described for B (left). For native PAGE (8%) of the ASK1-STRAP complex, purified recombinant ASK1 was autophosphorylated, and 2–3 μg was incubated with unlabeled recombinant GST, as a control, or wild-type and mutant forms of STRAP (5 μg of each) as indicated at room temperature for 1 h (right). Experiments were independently performed at least three times with similar results. re., recombinant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further define the region of ASK1 that interacts with STRAP, we generated four cysteine-to-serine amino acid substitution mutants of ASK1-C (C1005S, C1351S, C1360S, and C1351S/C1360S). This was done because the physical association of STRAP with its interacting partners, such as Nm23-H1 and p53, is mediated by cysteine residues in these proteins (23Jung H. Seong H.A. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35293-35307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Seong H.A. Jung H. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12075-12096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). STRAP interacted with ASK1-C and its mutant C1005S. STRAP also interacted weakly with the ASK1-C mutants C1351S and C1360S (Fig. 3A, lower right), but this interaction was not observed in the presence of the C1351S/C1360S mutant (Fig. 3B, left), indicating that both Cys1351 and Cys1360 of ASK1 play a critical role in its association with STRAP. We also confirmed the effect of the cysteine residues of ASK1-C on the association between ASK1 and STRAP using non-denaturing PAGE. Consistently, a shift in the mobility of 35S-labeled STRAP was evident upon incubation in the presence of ASK1-C and was weakly detectable in the presence of the ASK1-C mutants, C1351S and C1360S (Fig. 3B, right, second lane versus the third and fourth lanes). Additionally, the band shift was not observed in the presence of the C1351S/C1360S mutant (Fig. 3B, right, second lane versus fifth lane), again supporting a physical association between ASK1 and STRAP through cysteine residues. To identify the STRAP region required for ASK1 binding, we first performed in vivo binding assays with HEK293 cells transfected with two deletion constructs"
https://openalex.org/W1982023888,"Mucin-type O-glycan biosynthesis is regulated by the family of UDP-GalNAc polypeptide:N-acetylgalactosaminlytransfersases (ppGalNAcTs) that catalyzes the first step in the pathway by transferring GalNAc to Ser or Thr residues in a protein from the sugar donor UDP-GalNAc. Because not all Ser/Thr residues are glycosylated, rules must exist that signal which hydroyxamino acids acquire sugar. To date, no universal consensus signal has emerged. Therefore, strategies to deduce the subset of proteins that will be glycosylated by distinct ppGalNAcTs must be developed. Mucin-type O-glycoproteins are present abundantly in bone, where we found multiple ppGalNAcT isoforms, including ppGalNAcT-1, to be highly expressed. Thus, we compared glycoproteins expressed in wild-type and Galnt1-null mice to identify bone-associated proteins that were glycosylated in a ppGalNAcT-1-dependent manner. A reduction in the apparent molecular masses of two SIBLINGs (small integrin binding ligand N-linked glycoproteins), osteopontin (OPN) and bone sialoprotein (BSP) in the Galnt1-null mice relative to those of the wild-type was observed. Several synthetic peptides derived from OPN and BSP sequences were designed to include either known or predicted (in silico) glycosylation sites. In vitro glycosylation assays of these peptides with recombinant ppGalNAcT-1, ppGalNAcT-2, or ppGalNAcT-3 demonstrated that both SIBLINGs contained Thr/Ser residues that were preferentially glycosylated by ppGalNAcT-1. In addition, lysates prepared from wild-type, but not those from Galnt1-null derived osteoblasts, could glycosylate these peptides efficiently, suggesting that OPN and BSP contain sites that are specific for ppGalNAcT-1. Our study presents a novel and systematic approach for identification of isoform-specific substrates of the ppGalNAcT family and suggests ppGalNAcT-1 to be indispensable for O-glycosylation at specific sites of the bone glycoproteins OPN and BSP."

However, molecular mechanisms of regulation of MAP2 gene expression in melanoma are not understood. Here, we show that in melanoma cells MAP2 expression is induced by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-cytidine, and MAP2 promoter is progressively methylated during melanoma progression, indicating that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in silencing of MAP2 in melanoma. In support of this, methylation of MAP2 promoter DNA in vitro inhibits its activity. Because MAP2 promoter activity levels in melanoma cell lines also correlated with activating mutation in BRAF, a gene that is highly expressed in neurons, we hypothesized that BRAF signaling is involved in MAP2 expression. We show that hyperactivation of BRAF-MEK signaling activates MAP2 expression in melanoma cells by two independent mechanisms, promoter demethylation or down-regulation of neuronal transcription repressor HES1.

Here, we have used the established MCF-10A 3-dimensional (3D) model of mammary morphogenesis as a biologically relevant system to determine how BAG-1 expression may influence the development of breast cancer. When cultured in 3D, MCF-10A cells undergo a highly regulated morphogenic program leading to the development of polarized acinar structures containing a central, hollow lumen formed, in part, through the induction of BIM-dependent apoptosis. BAG-1 overexpression resulted in an attenuation of this normal apoptotic program characterized by a significantly increased number of acini with filled lumens-a phenotype commonly observed in ductal carcinoma in situ. BAG-1's effects were associated with an activation of RAF-1-a known binding partner of BAG-1, enhanced signaling through the MAP kinase pathway and a decrease in BIM expression. Reversal of the BAG-1-associated survival phenotype by the mitogen-activated kinase/ERK kinase inhibitor, U0126, implicates the RAF-1-extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway as a major mediator of BAG-1's effects in this model. As BAG-1 expression is often elevated in preinvasive breast cancers, these findings support a possible role for BAG-1 as an early contributor to the malignant process in the breast."
https://openalex.org/W2031559484,"Argonaute proteins (AGOs) are central to RNA interference (RNAi) and related silencing pathways. At the core of the RNAi pathway in the ancient parasitic eukaryote Trypanosoma brucei is a single Argonaute protein, TbAGO1, with an established role in the destruction of potentially harmful retroposon transcripts. One notable feature of TbAGO1 is that a fraction sediments with polyribosomes, and this association is facilitated by an arginine/glycine-rich domain (RGG domain) at the N terminus of the protein. Here we report that reducing the size of the RGG domain and, in particular, mutating all arginine residues severely reduced the association of TbAGO1 with polyribosomes and RNAi-induced cleavage of mRNA. However, these mutations did not change the cellular localization of Argonaute and did not affect the accumulation of single-stranded siRNAs, an essential step in the activation of the RNA-induced silencing complex. We further show that mRNA on polyribosomes can be targeted for degradation, although this alliance is not a pre-requisite. Finally, sequestering tubulin mRNAs from translation with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides reduced the RNAi response indicating that mRNAs not engaged in translation may be less accessible to the RNAi machinery. We conclude that the association of the RNAi machinery and target mRNA on polyribosomes promotes an efficient RNAi response. This mechanism may represent an ancient adaptation to ensure that retroposon transcripts are efficiently destroyed, if they become associated with the translational apparatus."

WBS results from a microdeletion at the chromosomal location 7q11.23 that encompasses the genes encoding the members of TFII-I family of transcription factors. Given that the haploinsufficiency for TFII-I is causative to the craniofacial phenotype in humans, we set out to analyze the effect of post-transcriptional silencing of TFII-I during BMP-2-driven osteoblast differentiation in the C2C12 cell line. Our results show that TFII-I plays an inhibitory role in regulating genes that are essential in osteogenesis and intersects with the bone-specific transcription factor Runx2 and the retinoblastoma protein, pRb. Identification of pathways regulated by TFII-I family transcription factors may begin to shed light on the molecular determinants of WBS."
https://openalex.org/W1981046089,"Prokaryotic and eukaryotic replicative helicases can translocate along single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, with the central cavity of these multimeric ring helicases being able to accommodate both forms of DNA. Translocation by such helicases along single-stranded DNA results in the unwinding of forked DNA by steric exclusion and appears critical in unwinding of parental strands at the replication fork, whereas translocation over double-stranded DNA has no well-defined role. We have found that the accessory factor, DnaC, that promotes loading of the Escherichia coli replicative helicase DnaB onto single-stranded DNA may also act to confer DNA structure specificity on DnaB helicase. When present in excess, DnaC inhibits DnaB translocation over double-stranded DNA but not over single-stranded DNA. Inhibition of DnaB translocation over double-stranded DNA requires the ATP-bound form of DnaC, and this inhibition is relieved during translocation over single-stranded DNA indicating that stimulation of DnaC ATPase is responsible for this DNA structure specificity.

This separation is achieved by DNA helicases, enzymes that couple the energy derived from the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates to translocation along the DNA and associated disruption of hydrogen bonding between the parental DNA strands (1Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Helicases required for strand separation during DNA replication have a multimeric ring structure in which the DNA along which the helicase is translocating passes through the ring (reviewed in Ref. 2Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). This toroidal structure might endow replicative helicases with high processivity, a prerequisite for duplication of large stretches of DNA. It may also facilitate multiple contacts with other proteins at the replication fork, consistent with the replicative helicase playing a central coordinating role within the replisome (3Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). DNA replication in Escherichia coli utilizes the hexameric DnaB ring helicase (4LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Baker T.A. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6877-6885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DnaB binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 2The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). along which it translocates in the 5′-3′ direction to catalyze unwinding at a replication fork (4LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unwinding is effected by a steric exclusion mechanism in which the strand not initially bound within the DnaB ring is excluded from the ring (6Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Galletto R. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, steric exclusion is promoted by the structure of the DNA along which DnaB translocates and is not an inherent property of DnaB itself (6Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). DnaB can accommodate two and even three DNA strands within its hexameric ring even though it can initially load only onto ssDNA (8Kaplan D.L. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3116-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1Cii). In such instances, catalysis by DnaB results in translocation only, allowing the helicase ring to slide over double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) without significant disruption of base pairing (10Kaplan D.L. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). single-stranded DNA double-stranded DNA adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). Generation of ssDNA for binding of DnaB is effected by DnaA at the chromosomal origin of replication oriC (11Funnell B.E. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 34143-34151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). At oriC, translocation of DnaB upon loading onto ssDNA leads to each hexamer encountering forked DNA structures at opposite ends of oriC (17Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The forked nature of the DNA leads to the strand not passing through the DnaB ring being excluded from the ring, the outcome being unwinding of the two parental DNA strands. DnaB can load onto ssDNA without the aid of other proteins in vitro (4LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this process is promoted by DnaC in vitro resulting in stimulation of DnaB helicase activity (18Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, promotion by DnaC is essential for DnaA-directed loading of DnaB at oriC (19Wechsler J.A.

DnaC is a monomer in solution but associates with DnaB in a 1:1 stoichiometry, forming primarily a DnaB6-DnaC6 complex (21Ludlam A.V. McNatt M.W. Carr K.M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol.

How DnaC acts to promote binding of DnaB onto ssDNA is still not understood but DnaC can bind both ssDNA and adenine nucleotides (25Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Learn B.A. Um S.J. Huang L. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell. 2008; 135: 623-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and, in the presence of both DnaB and ssDNA, DnaC can hydrolyze ATP (30Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the ATP-bound form of DnaC is not essential for promotion of DnaB loading onto ssDNA as both ADP-bound and nucleotide-free DnaC also promote DnaB helicase activity (30Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). DnaCATP is, though, essential for DnaC-directed loading of DnaB at oriC possibly via DnaCATP-dependent expansion of the ssDNA generated by DnaA at oriC (30Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, DnaC interacts with DnaA, an interaction that depends upon both proteins being in an ATP-bound state (29Mott M.L. Erzberger J.P. Coons M.M. Berger J.M. Cell. 2008; 135: 623-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The essential requirement for DnaCATP at oriC might reflect therefore the need for a DnaAATP-DnaCATP interaction rather than expansion of the ssDNA bubble at oriC. However, DnaCATP also inhibits DnaB helicase activity (18Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), relief of which requires hydrolysis of ATP by DnaC, stimulated by the presence of both DnaB and ssDNA (30Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Neither DnaCADP nor nucleotide-free DnaC inhibits DnaB helicase function (30Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), possibly caused by enhanced dissociation of DnaC from the DnaB-ssDNA complex (22Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1975; 72: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Kobori J.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the intrinsic affinity of DnaCADP for DnaB is similar to that of DnaCATP (24Galletto R. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 441-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28Biswas S.B. Flowers S. Biswas-Fiss E.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Any enhancement of dissociation of DnaCADP from DnaB may therefore be driven by the decreased affinity for ssDNA displayed by DnaCADP as compared with DnaCATP (28Biswas S.B. Flowers S. Biswas-Fiss E.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Regardless of the exact mechanism of DnaC-dependent loading of DnaB, the end result of DnaC function is facilitated assembly of active DnaB onto ssDNA. The above biochemical views of DnaC imply that DnaC acts only to load DnaB onto ssDNA and subsequently plays no part in replisome function. Indeed, if the concentration of DnaC exceeds that of DnaB in vitro then the helicase function of DnaB is inhibited, as is the DnaA-directed replication of oriC-containing plasmids (18Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Allen Jr., G.C. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22096-22101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 10-fold increase in DnaC concentration in vivo also results in a slowing of chromosomal duplication (32Skarstad K. Wold S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DnaC and DnaB might therefore be in a dynamic equilibrium in which the continual association of DnaCATP with DnaB inhibits DnaB helicase, while the DnaB- and ssDNA-stimulated hydrolysis of ATP by DnaC results in dissociation of DnaC from DnaB (25Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Excess DnaCATP would lead to an increased rate of association with, and inhibition of, DnaB. We have analyzed the interplay between DnaC and DnaB on a range of DNA substrates and have discovered that the inhibition of DnaB helicase by excess DnaC is dependent on the structure of the DNA substrate. We find that in the presence of ATP excess DnaC is a potent inhibitor of DnaB translocation over dsDNA but translocation of DnaB over ssDNA is not inhibited. This differential inhibition is dependent on the nucleotide-bound state of DnaC. DnaCADP or nucleotide-free DnaC do not inhibit DnaB regardless of the DNA structure. In contrast, DnaC bound to the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS inhibits DnaB translocation over both ssDNA and dsDNA. Given that ssDNA but not dsDNA stimulates ATP hydrolysis by DnaC (30Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), our data indicate that continual association of DnaCATP with DnaB is not inhibitory to DnaB helicase as long as ssDNA is available for stimulation of DnaC ATPase. Consequently DnaC may act as a DNA structure-selective modulator of DnaB helicase, promoting translocation of DnaB along ssDNA but inhibiting translocation along dsDNA. DnaC might therefore limit DnaB helicase activity, and thus replisome function, to forked DNA structures. DnaB and DnaC were purified as described (33Marians K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 507-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Streptavidin was purchased from Sigma. All protein concentrations refer to the monomer. DNA substrates (Table 1) were constructed using oligonucleotides, one of which in each structure was labeled with [γ32P]ATP at the 5′-end and purified by gel electrophoresis (34Parsons C.A. Kemper B. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9285-9289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences of the oligonucleotides are indicated in supplemental Table S1. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Eurogentec. All DNA concentrations refer to the concentration of the DNA structure rather than of nucleotide equivalents.TABLE 1DNA substrates Open table in a new tab Assays on substrates 1–7 were performed at 30 °C with 1 nm DNA substrate using reaction volumes of 10 μl in 40 mm HEPES-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP (except as indicated otherwise in the experiments in Fig. 4), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. CTP, ADP, and ATPγS were also included where indicated at the specified concentrations. Reactions were preincubated at 30 °C for 2 min prior to addition of DnaB and DnaC to the indicated final concentrations. Where indicated, streptavidin was included during this 2-min incubation. When DnaB and DnaC were both present, the two proteins were mixed on ice prior to addition to the reaction. Reactions were incubated for 4 min at 30 °C then were terminated by addition of 2.5 μl of stop buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% SDS, 200 mm EDTA, and 10 mg ml−1 proteinase K) followed by 2.5 μl of 0.25% bromphenol blue in 30% glycerol. Rates of dissociation of substrates 1–6 were performed as above, except that the reaction volume was increased to 70 μl to allow removal of 10 μl aliquots and addition of stop buffer, at the stated intervals.

The stop buffer also contained 25 nm of unlabeled oligonucleotide 12 for substrates 10 and 11 to inhibit the reannealing of labeled oligonucleotide 12 with other products of unwinding. The amount of DNA structure dissociation was analyzed by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide/TBE gels for 90 min at 190 V on 16-cm gels. Quantification was performed using a phosphorimager. All assays were performed 2–4 times, and the means of data were used for graphical presentation. The ATP- but not the ADP-bound form of DnaC can inhibit DnaB helicase, whereas single-stranded and not double-stranded DNA stimulates DnaC to hydrolyze bound ATP (18Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). DnaB can translocate along both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA (6Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting that stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by DnaC within a DnaC-DnaB-DNA complex may depend upon the nature of the DNA along which DnaB is translocating. To test this idea, we designed substrates to analyze movement of DnaB along both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. These substrates exploited previous work demonstrating that DnaB can load onto ssDNA and subsequently translocate over dsDNA (6Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10Kaplan D.L. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Substrate 1 was a forked DNA substrate possessing a 38-base 3′ arm and a 67-base 5′ arm (Table 1). This substrate could be unwound by DnaB, a 5′-3′ translocase (4LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to generate single-stranded DNA products (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Thus, DnaB could load onto the 67-base 5′ single-stranded DNA arm and translocate in a 5′ to 3′ direction to effect unwinding of the fork (Fig. 1, Ci). Placement of a 28-base pair duplex DNA region in the path of the translocating DnaB did not prevent unwinding of the fork (Fig. 1B, lane 2) but the 28-base pair duplex region was not unwound (supplemental Fig. S1, B–D). We conclude that on substrate 2, DnaB bound the single-stranded 5′ arm and translocated subsequently over the duplex DNA (Fig. 1, Cii) consistent with previous work (6Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Displacement of the labeled oligonucleotide from substrates 1 and 2 therefore monitored the movement of DnaB along the single-stranded and double-stranded regions engineered to be present on the 5′ arm of each substrate. To determine the effect of DnaC on DnaB translocation along double-stranded and single-stranded DNA, the effect of increasing concentrations of DnaC on unwinding of substrates 1 and 2 by DnaB was monitored. Addition of DnaC up to a ratio of DnaC:B::1:1 stimulated displacement of the labeled oligonucleotide by DnaB in both substrates (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 1–4). When the ratio of DnaC to DnaB was increased to 2:1 or more, unwinding of the labeled oligonucleotide by DnaB in substrate 1 was still stimulated by the presence of excess DnaC (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–7 and Fig. 2D). However, stimulation of unwinding of the labeled oligonucleotide in substrate 2 was abolished when the ratio of DnaC:B exceeded 1:1 (Fig. 1, B, lanes 5–7 and D). Monitoring of the rates of unwinding of substrates 1 and 2 by DnaB at increasing DnaC:B ratios confirmed that excess DnaC had little effect on the stimulation of DnaB on substrate 1 but actually inhibited DnaB on substrate 2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Stimulation of DnaB helicase by DnaC depended therefore on the structure of the DNA substrate. The effect of addition of DnaC on DnaB helicase activity differed markedly on DNA substrates 1 and 2. The duplex region present on the 5′ arm of substrate 2, but absent in substrate 1, suggested that the requirement for DnaB to translocate over dsDNA in substrate 2 to catalyze unwinding of the labeled oligonucleotide may have been responsible for this difference. However, the two substrates also differed in the amount of ssDNA available for binding of DnaB to effect unwinding. Substrate 1 had 67 bases whereas substrate 2 had 39 bases (Table 1). To establish if the size of the ssDNA target for DnaB binding was responsible for the differential inhibition of DnaB by excess DnaC, a third substrate was analyzed, substrate 5 (Table 1) that had the same ssDNA binding site size as substrate 2 but lacked a duplex region over which DnaB had to translocate to unwind the labeled oligonucleotide. Analysis of the rates of unwinding of substrate 5 by DnaB in the presence of increasing concentrations of DnaC demonstrated that stimulation was observed at all concentrations of DnaC tested (Fig. 2C). This stimulation was observed on substrate 5 even in the presence of an 8-fold excess of DnaC over DnaB (Fig. 2C). Differences in the ssDNA binding site size for DnaB in substrates 1 and 2 could not account therefore for the differential effects of excess DnaC. If the requirement for DnaB to translocate over the dsDNA in substrate 2 did account for the inhibition by excess DnaC then prevention of DnaB from sliding over this duplex should prevent inhibition by excess DnaC. Addition of a 3′ ssDNA arm to an unbranched duplex region inhibits DnaB translocation over the duplex by steric exclusion of the 3′ arm from the central cavity of the DnaB hexamer (6Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The dsDNA in substrate 2 was converted therefore into a forked duplex (substrate 4). Analysis of the effects of DnaC on DnaB-catalyzed unwinding of substrate 4 revealed that unwinding by DnaB was stimulated at all concentrations of DnaC tested, in contrast to substrate 2 (Fig. 2, compare B and D). Thus, the inhibition of DnaB-catalyzed unwinding of substrate 2 by excess DnaC could be relieved by replacement of the unbranched duplex region with a forked duplex. These data are consistent with a model in which inhibition of DnaB by excess DnaC occurs only when DnaB translocates over dsDNA, as in the case of substrate 2. However, the ssDNA-dsDNA junction present in substrate 2, and encountered first by translocating DnaB, lacked a 3′ ssDNA arm. Lack of this feature might therefore have impacted directly on the interaction of DnaC with DnaB, possibly via interaction between DnaC and the 3′ ssDNA arm, rather than exerting an effect indirectly by preventing DnaB translocation over dsDNA. To test this possibility we employed a DNA structure identical to substrate 2 except for the presence of a deoxyribose-biotin moiety at the 3′ terminus of the ssDNA-dsDNA junction (substrate 6 in Fig. 3 and Table 1). Although hexameric ring helicases such as DnaB unwind forked DNA structures by steric exclusion of the 3′ ssDNA arm, the presence of streptavidin bound to a biotinylated 3′ DNA end also results in exclusion of the DNA end from the central cavity of the helicase and unwinding by steric exclusion (35Hacker K.J. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14080-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 36Heller R.C. Marians K.J. Nature. 2006; 439: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As expected, this 3′ terminal biotin moiety allowed unwinding of the partial duplex by DnaB in the presence but not the absence of streptavidin (supplemental Fig. S2). We next compared the effects of DnaC upon unwinding of substrate 6 by DnaB. In the absence of streptavidin, unwinding of substrate 6 by DnaB was stimulated by an equimolar concentration of DnaC, but this stimulation was reduced in the presence of excess DnaC (Fig. 3A). This pattern was similar to the effects of DnaC on unwinding of substrate 2 by DnaB although the negative impact of excess DnaC was reduced on substrate 6 (compare Fig. 3, A and C). In contrast, addition of streptavidin resulted in similar levels of stimulation of DnaB-catalyzed unwinding of substrate 6 by both an equimolar concentration and an 8-fold excess of DnaC (Fig. 3B). Thus, in the presence of streptavidin, the effects of DnaC on unwinding of substrate 6 by DnaB reflected the patterns seen previously with substrates 1, 4, and 5 (compare Figs. 2, A, C, and D and 3B). This marked difference in the effect of streptavidin on unwinding of substrate 6 was not seen on substrate 2 (Fig. 3, C and D) demonstrating that maintenance of stimulation of DnaB by excess DnaC was a specific consequence of the streptavidin-biotin interaction. These data demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of excess DnaC on unwinding of substrate 2 by DnaB were not due specifically to the lack of a 3′ ssDNA arm at the ssDNA-dsDNA junction. The data in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 demonstrate that inhibition of DnaB by DnaC is dictated by the structure of the DNA substrate. They also demonstrate that the primary determinant of inhibition by DnaC is whether DnaB must translocate over dsDNA. Note that the assays in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 were performed at 30 °C, not 37 °C, to facilitate the measurement of rates of unwinding. Similar overall patterns of stimulation and inhibition of DnaB by DnaC were observed at 37 °C (data not shown) but initial rates of unwinding were too rapid to measure accurately. Note also that this current study employed 10 mm magnesium acetate and 2 mm ATP. However, reaction conditions employed previously to investigate DnaB translocation along dsDNA (8Kaplan D.L.

DnaB-catalyzed unwinding of an unbranched partial duplex DNA substrate is stimulated by equimolar concentrations of DnaCATP, DnaCADP, or nucleotide-free DnaC but only DnaCATP inhibits when in excess over DnaB (30Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We tested therefore whether ATP binding and/or hydrolysis by DnaC played any role in conferring DNA structure specificity on DnaB helicase activity by comparing the effects of different nucleotide states of DnaC on unwinding of substrates 2 and 5 by DnaB. We exploited the ability of DnaB to hydrolyze CTP to promote DNA unwinding (30Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 37Arai K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Roychowdhury A. Szymanski M.R. Jezewska M.J. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6730-6746Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast, while the Kd of ATP, ADP, and ATPγS for DnaC is 3–8 × 10−6 m, the affinity of CTP for DnaC is at least 3–4 orders of magnitude lower (27Galletto R. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12959-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Consequently, in the presence of high concentrations of CTP but low concentrations of or no adenine nucleotides, DnaB would be bound predominantly to CTP while DnaC would be bound to the adenine nucleotide or nucleotide-free (30Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the presence of 2 mm CTP, stimulation of DnaB helicase was observed on both substrates 2 and 5 with an equimolar concentration of DnaC, reflecting the stimulation seen with 2 mm ATP (Fig. 4, A"
https://openalex.org/W2066336601,"Double-stranded (ds)RNA in the infected cells is a trait shared by most if not all viruses. While humans have developed variable immune responses, viruses have also developed counter-measures to defeat dsRNA-induced antiviral strategies. Thus, we proposed a broad antiviral strategy to antagonize the countermeasures of viruses and bypass the dsRNA-induced signals that are readily defeated by viruses. By rewiring the dsRNA-binding proteins in the dsRNA complex and reconnecting them to apoptosis signaling, we created several dsRNA-dependent caspase recruiters, termed dsCAREs, to bypass dsRNA-induced antiviral signals that would otherwise be targeted by viruses. Adenovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus, representing viruses of the dsDNA and negative-stranded RNA viral groups, were used to infect HEK293 cells. The dsCARE chimera was added in medium to evaluate its antiviral activity. The truncated dsCAREs were used as controls. We demonstrate that dsCARE suppresses viral infection starting at 0.1 µg/ml and reaches the peak at 2 µg/ml. The EC50 was ~0.2 µg/ml. However, it had an undetectable effect on uninfected cells. Further data show that both dsRNA binding and apoptosis activation of dsCARE are essential for its antiviral activity. We conclude that dsRNA is a practical virus-associated molecular pattern that can be targeted for broad and rapid antiviral prophylaxis.—Fei, Z., Liu, Y., Yan, Z., Fan, D., Alexander, A., Yang, J.-H.
