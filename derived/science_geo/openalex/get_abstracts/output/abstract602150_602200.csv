https://openalex.org/W2782372577,"In a previous report we showed that intravenous infusion of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) improved functional recovery after contusive spinal cord injury (SCI) in the non-immunosuppressed rat, although the MSCs themselves were not detected at the spinal cord injury (SCI) site [1]. Rather, the MSCs lodged transiently in the lungs for about two days post-infusion. Preliminary studies and a recent report [2] suggest that the effects of intravenous (IV) infusion of MSCs could be mimicked by IV infusion of exosomes isolated from conditioned media of MSC cultures (MSCexos). In this study, we assessed the possible mechanism of MSCexos action on SCI by investigating the tissue distribution and cellular targeting of DiR fluorescent labeled MSCexos at 3 hours and 24 hours after IV infusion in rats with SCI. The IV delivered MSCexos were detected in contused regions of the spinal cord, but not in the noninjured region of the spinal cord, and were also detected in the spleen, which was notably reduced in weight in the SCI rat, compared to control animals. DiR “hotspots” were specifically associated with CD206-expressing M2 macrophages in the spinal cord and this was confirmed by co-localization with anti-CD63 antibodies labeling a tetraspanin characteristically expressed on exosomes. Our findings that MSCexos specifically target M2-type macrophages at the site of SCI, support the idea that extracellular vesicles, released by MSCs, may mediate at least some of the therapeutic effects of IV MSC administration."

In this study, we characterized and examined the early metabolic changes in the triple transgenic mouse AD model (3xtg-AD), and their relationship with the hypothalamus, a key regulator of metabolism in the central nervous system. We observed that the 3xtg-AD model exhibited significantly higher oxygen consumption as well as food intake before reported amyloid plaque formation, indicating that metabolic abnormalities occurred at early onset in the 3xtg-AD model compared with their counterparts. Analysis of gene expression in the hypothalamus indicated increased mRNA expression of inflammation- and apoptosis-related genes, as well as decreased gene expression of Agouti-related protein (AgRP) and Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) at 12 weeks of age. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and NPY-expressing neurons decreased at 24 weeks in the 3xtg-AD model. Four weeks of voluntary exercise were sufficient to reverse the gene expression of inflammation and apoptotic markers in the hypothalamus, six weeks of exercise improved glucose metabolism, moreover, 8 weeks of voluntary exercise training attenuated apoptosis and augmented POMC and NPY-expressing neuronal populations in the hypothalamus compared to the control group. Our results indicated that early onset of metabolic abnormalities may contribute to the pathology of AD, which is associated with increased inflammation as well as decreased neuronal population and key neuropeptides in the hypothalamus. Furthermore, early intervention by voluntary exercise normalized hypothalamic inflammation and neurodegeneration as well as glucose metabolism in the 3xtg-AD model. The data, taken as a whole, suggests a hypothalamic-mediated mechanism where exercise prevents the progression of dementia and of Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2781918956,"The objectives of the study were to investigate prevalence of cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes to inform HPV vaccination strategy in South Africa and to study factors associated with HPV prevalence. Sexually active, HIV-negative women, aged 16-22 years recruited from Soweto (n = 143) and Cape Town (n = 148) were tested for cervical HPV and other genital infections. Overall HPV prevalence was 66.7% (194/291) in young women. Cape Town women were more likely to have multiple HPV infections than the Soweto women (48.0%, 71/148 versus 35.0%, 50/143 respectively, p = 0.033) and probable HR-HPV types (34.5%, 51/148 versus 21.7%, 31/143 respectively, p = 0.022). The most frequently detected HPV types were HPV-16 (11.7%), HPV-58 (10.3%), HPV-51 (8.9%), HPV-66 (8.6%), HPV-18 and HPV-81 (7.6% each). HPV types targeted by the bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV-16/18) were detected in 18.6% (54/291) of women, while those in the quadrivalent vaccine (HPV-6/11/16/18) were detected in 24.7% (72/291) of women; and those in the nonavalent vaccine (HPV-6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) were detected in 38.5% (112/291) of women. In a multivariable analysis, bacterial vaginosis remained significantly associated with HPV infection (OR: 4.0, 95% CI: 1.4-12.6). Women were more likely to be HPV positive if they had received treatment for STI during the past 6-months (OR: 3.4, 95% CI: 1.1-12.4) or if they had ever been pregnant (OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-5.5). Compared to women who reported only one sexual partner, those with increased number of lifetime sex partners were more likely to have HPV (4-10 partners: OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.1-8.0). The high prevalence of HPV types targeted by the nonavalent HPV vaccine encourages the introduction of this vaccine and catch-up HPV vaccination campaigns in South Africa. The high burden of BV and concurrent STIs also highlights the need to improve the prevention and appropriate management of sexually-acquired and other genital tract infections in South African youth."
https://openalex.org/W2781959811,"Objectives Recurrence following recommended treatment for bacterial vaginosis is unacceptably high. While the pathogenesis of recurrence is not well understood, recent evidence indicates re-infection from sexual partners is likely to play a role. The aim of this study was to assess the acceptability and tolerability of topical and oral antimicrobial therapy in male partners of women with bacterial vaginosis (BV), and to investigate the impact of dual-partner treatment on the vaginal and penile microbiota. Methods Women with symptomatic BV (Nugent Score of 4–10 and ≥3 Amsel criteria) and their regular male sexual partner were recruited from Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, Melbourne, Australia. Women received oral metronidazole 400mg twice daily (or intra-vaginal 2% clindamycin cream, if contraindicated) for 7-days. Male partners received oral metronidazole 400mg twice daily and 2% clindamycin cream topically to the penile skin twice daily for 7-days. Couples provided self-collected genital specimens and completed questionnaires at enrolment and then weekly for 4-weeks. Genital microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Changes in genital microbiota composition were assessed by Bray-Curtis index. Bacterial diversity was measured by the Shannon Diversity Index. Results Twenty-two couples were recruited. Sixteen couples (76%) completed all study procedures. Adherence was high; most participants took >90% of prescribed medication. Medication, and particularly topical clindamycin in males, was well tolerated. Dual-partner treatment had an immediate and sustained effect on the composition of vaginal microbiota (median Bray-Curtis score day 0 versus day 8 = 0.03 [IQR 0–0.15], day 0 vs day 28 = 0.03 [0.02–0.11]). We observed a reduction in bacterial diversity of the vaginal microbiota and a decrease in the prevalence and abundance of BV-associated bacteria following treatment. Treatment had an immediate effect on the composition of the cutaneous penile microbiota (median Bray-Curtis score day 0 vs day 8 = 0.09 [0.04–0.17]), however this was not as pronounced at day 28 (median Bray-Curtis score day 0 vs day 28 = 0.38 [0.11–0.59]). A decrease in the prevalence and abundance of BV-associated bacteria in the cutaneous penile microbiota was observed immediately following treatment at day 8. Conclusion Combined oral and topical treatment of male partners of women with BV is acceptable and well tolerated. The combined acceptability and microbiological data presented in this paper supports the need for larger studies with longer follow up to characterize the sustained effect of dual partner treatment on the genital microbiota of couples and assess the impact on BV recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2781940944,"Sepsis continues to be a major problem for hospitalized patients. Opioids are widely used medications for pain management despite recent evidence revealing their adverse effects. The present study evaluates survival differences between opioid-treated patients and non-opioid-treated patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of sepsis. Clinical data was extracted from the University of Minnesota’s Clinical Data Repository, which includes Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of the patients seen at 8 hospitals. Among 5,994 patients diagnosed with sepsis, 4,540 opioid-treated patients and 1,454 non-opioid patients were included based on whether they are exposed to prescription opioids during their hospitalization. Cox proportional hazards regression showed that after adjustments for demographics, clinical comorbidities, severity of illness, and types of infection, opioid-treated patients had a significantly higher risk of death at 28 days."
https://openalex.org/W2782240323,"The 3D orientation of clasts within a deposit are known to be informative on processes that formed that deposit. In archaeological sites, a portion of the clasts in the deposit are introduced by non-geological processes, and these are typically systematically recorded in archaeological excavations with total stations. By recording a second point on elongated clasts it is possible to quickly and precisely capture their orientation. The statistical and graphical techniques for analyzing these data are well published, and there is a growing set of actualistic and archaeological comparative data to help with the interpretation of the documented patterns. This paper advances this area of research in presenting methods to address some shortcomings in current methodologies. First, a method for calculating confidence intervals on orientation statistics is presented to help address the question of how many objects are needed to assess the formation of a deposit based on orientations. Second, a method for assessing the probability that two assemblages have different orientations is presented based on permutations testing. This method differs from existing ones in that it considers three-dimensional orientations rather than working separately with the two-dimensional bearing and plunge components. Third, a method is presented to examine spatial variability in orientations based on a moving windows approach. The raw data plus the R code to build this document and to implement these methods plus those already described by McPherron are included to help further their use in assessing archaeological site formation processes."
https://openalex.org/W2782274917,"TRPV4 channels are calcium-permeable cation channels that are activated by several physicochemical stimuli. Accordingly, TRPV4 channels have been implicated in the regulation of osmosensing, mechanotransduction, thermosensation, and epithelial/endothelial barrier functions. Whether TRPV4 is also mechanistically implicated in melanoma cell proliferation is not clear. Here, we hypothesized that TRPV4 is expressed in human melanoma and that pharmacological activation interferes with cell proliferation.TRPV4 functions were studied in melanoma cell lines (A375, SK-MEL-28, MKTBR), immortalized non-cancer keratinocytes (HaCaT), and murine 3T3 fibroblasts by patch-clamp, qRT-PCR, intracellular calcium measurements, cell proliferation, and flow cytometric assays of apoptosis and cell cycle. The selective TRPV4-activator, GSK1016790A, elicited non-selective cation currents with TRPV4-typical current-voltage-relationship in all cell lines. GSK1016790A-induced currents were blocked by the TRPV4-blocker, HC067047. TRPV4 mRNA expression was demonstrated by qRT-PCR. In A375 cells, TRPV4 activation was frequently paralleled by co-activation of calcium/calmodulin-regulated KCa3.1 channels. Light microscopy showed that TRPV4-activation produced rapid cellular disarrangement, nuclear densification, and detachment of a large fraction of all melanoma cell lines and HaCaT cells. TRPV4-activation induced apoptosis and drastically inhibited A375 and HaCaT proliferation that could be partially prevented by HC067047.Our study showed that TRPV4 channels were functionally expressed in human melanoma cell lines and in human keratinocytes. Pharmacological TRPV4 activation in human melanoma cells and keratinocytes caused severe cellular disarrangement, necrosis and apoptosis. Pharmacological targeting of TRPV4 could be an alternative or adjuvant therapeutic strategy to treat melanoma progression and other proliferative skin disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2782526075,"Non-human primates participating in neurophysiological research are exposed to potentially stressful experimental procedures, such as dietary control protocols, surgical implants and their maintenance, or social separation during training and experimental session. Here, we investigated the effect of controlled access to fluid, surgical implants, implant-related cleaning of skin margins, and behavioral training sessions on salivary cortisol levels of adult male rhesus macaques participating in neurophysiological research. The animals were trained to chew flavored cotton swabs to non-invasively collect saliva samples. Our data show no differences in cortisol levels between animals with and without implants, but both, controlled access to fluid and cleaning of implants individually increased salivary cortisol concentrations, while both together did not further increase the concentration. Specifically, before cleaning, individuals with controlled access to fluid had 55% higher cortisol concentrations than individuals with free access to fluid. Under free access to fluid, cortisol concentrations were 27% higher after cleaning while no effect of cleaning was found for individuals under controlled fluid access. Training sessions under controlled access to fluid also did not affect salivary cortisol concentrations. The observed changes in cortisol concentrations represent mild stress responses, as they are only a fraction of the range of the regular circadian changes in cortisol levels in rhesus monkeys. They also indicate that combinations of procedures do not necessarily lead to cumulative stress responses. Our results indicate that salivary cortisol levels of rhesus monkeys respond to neurophysiological experimental procedures and, hence, may be used to assess further refinements of such experimental methods."
https://openalex.org/W2781882786,"The possible impacts of the European Commission’s proposed North Sea Multi-Annual Plan are evaluated in terms of its likely outcomes to achieve management objectives for fishing pressure, species’ biomass, fishery yield, the landed value of key species and ecosystem objectives. The method applies management strategy evaluation procedures that employ an ecosystem model of the North Sea and its fisheries as the operating model. Taking five key dimensions of the proposed plan, it identifies those areas that are key to its successful performance. Overwhelmingly, choices in the options for the implementation of regulatory measures on discarding practices outweigh the effects of options related to fishing within ranges associated with ‘pretty good yield’, the way that biomass conservation safeguard mechanisms are applied and the timeframe for achieving fishing mortality targets. The impact of safeguard options and ranges in fishing mortality become important only when stock biomass is close to its reference points. The fifth dimension–taking into account wider conservation and ecosystem objectives—reveals that discard policy has a big impact on conservation species, but also that the type of harvest control rule can play an important role in limiting risks to stocks by ‘applying the brakes’ early. The consequences to fisheries however is heightened risk to their viability, thus exposing the sustainability trade-offs faced with balancing societal pressures for blue growth and enhanced conservation. It also reveals the wider ecosystem impacts that emphasise the connectivity between the demersal and pelagic realms, and thus, the importance of not treating the demersal NSMAP in isolation from other management plans. When stocks are below their biomass reference points, low F strategies lead to better long term economic performance, but for stocks consistently above biomass reference points, high F strategies lead to higher long term value. Nephrops and whiting often show contradictory responses to the strategies because changes in their predators abundance affects their abundance and success of their fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W2619964388,"Aims To test the ability of four circulating biomarkers of fibrosis, and of low left atrial voltage, to predict recurrence of atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation. Background Circulating biomarkers potentially may be used to improve patient selection for atrial fibrillation ablation. Low voltage areas in the left atrium predict arrhythmia recurrence when mapped in sinus rhythm. This study tested type III procollagen N terminal peptide (PIIINP), galectin-3 (gal-3), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), and type I collagen C terminal telopeptide (ICTP), and whether low voltage areas in the left atrium predicted atrial fibrillation recurrence, irrespective of the rhythm during mapping. Methods 92 atrial fibrillation ablation patients were studied. Biomarker levels in peripheral and intra-cardiac blood were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Low voltage (<0.5mV) was expressed as a proportion of the mapped left atrial surface area. Follow-up was one year. The primary endpoint was recurrence of arrhythmia. The secondary endpoint was a composite of recurrence despite two procedures, or after one procedure if no second procedure was undertaken. Results The biomarkers were not predictive of either endpoint. After multivariate Cox regression analysis, high proportion of low voltage area in the left atrium was found to predict the primary endpoint in sinus rhythm mapping (hazard ratio 4.323, 95% confidence interval 1.337–13.982, p = 0.014) and atrial fibrillation mapping (hazard ratio 5.195, 95% confidence interval 1.032–26.141, p = 0.046). This effect was also apparent for the secondary endpoint. Conclusion The studied biomarkers do not predict arrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation. Left atrial voltage is an independent predictor of recurrence, whether the left atrium is mapped in atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm."
https://openalex.org/W2781994601,"The evidences on the association of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) to coronary heart diseases (CHD) are conflicting. In order to answer this important but yet unanswered clinical health issue, a large cohort study such as big data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database should be more convincing. Therefore, we aimed to make use of these big data source to analyze and clarify the relevance of H. pylori eradication and CHD risks. We looked through a total of 208196 patients with peptic ulcer diseases (PUD) from the years of 2000 to 2011. First, 3713 patients who received H. pylori eradication within 365 days of the index date were defined as the group A. We randomly selected the same number of patients as cohort A from 55249 non-eradication patients to be the comparison group B using propensity scores (including age, gender and comorbidity) so that we could control the confounding variables of CHD and mortality. Importantly, we perform sensitivity analysis for the time-dependent association between H. pylori eradication and risk of CHD, interactions between patient demographic characteristics and therapy by age (≥ or < 65 years old). The results showed that a trend of decreased association of CHD in patients with early eradication was observed compared to those without eradication (2.58% vs. 3.35%, p = 0.0905). The mortality rate was lower in early eradication subgroup compared to cohort B (2.86% vs. 4.43%, p = 0.0033). Interestingly, there was also significant difference observed in composite end-points for CHD and death in the early eradication subgroup (0.16% vs.0.57%, p = 0.0133). Further, the cumulative CHD rate was significantly lower in younger patients (< 65 years old) with H. pylori eradication therapy started < 1 year compared to those patients without eradication at all (p = 0.0384); the treatment did not appear to have an effect in older patients (≥ 65 years old) (p = 0.1963). Multivariate analysis showed that hypertension and renal diseases were risk factors for CHD in patients without eradication whilst younger age (< 65 years old) initiated with H. pylori therapy was a protective factor. In conclusion, the trend of decrease in CHD occurrence after early H. pylori eradication in addition to the significant decrease in composite end points for CHD and death, the significantly lower cumulative CHD rate in younger patients < 65 years old with H. pylori treated within 365 days suggested that there was positive association between H. pylori eradication and CHD."
https://openalex.org/W2781636479,"To develop novel interventions for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) core symptoms, valid, reliable, and sensitive longitudinal outcome measures are required for detecting symptom change over time. Here, we tested whether a computerized analysis of quantitative facial expression measures could act as a marker for core ASD social symptoms. Facial expression intensity values during a semi-structured socially interactive situation extracted from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) were quantified by dedicated software in 18 high-functioning adult males with ASD. Controls were 17 age-, gender-, parental socioeconomic background-, and intellectual level-matched typically developing (TD) individuals. Statistical analyses determined whether values representing the strength and variability of each facial expression element differed significantly between the ASD and TD groups and whether they correlated with ADOS reciprocal social interaction scores. Compared with the TD controls, facial expressions in the ASD group appeared more “Neutral” (d = 1.02, P = 0.005, PFDR < 0.05) with less variation in Neutral expression (d = 1.08, P = 0.003, PFDR < 0.05). Their expressions were also less “Happy” (d = −0.78, P = 0.038, PFDR > 0.05) with lower variability in Happy expression (d = 1.10, P = 0.003, PFDR < 0.05). Moreover, the stronger Neutral facial expressions in the ASD participants were positively correlated with poorer ADOS reciprocal social interaction scores (ρ = 0.48, P = 0.042). These findings indicate that our method for quantitatively measuring reduced facial expressivity during social interactions can be a promising marker for core ASD social symptoms."

This study documents variation in risk of URI between nine North American shelters; determines whether this reflects variation in pathogen frequency on intake or differences in transmission and expression of disease; and identifies modifiable environmental and group health factors linked to risk for URI. This study demonstrated that although periodic introduction of pathogens into shelter populations may be inevitable, disease resulting from those pathogens is not. Housing and care of cats, particularly during their first week of stay in an animal shelter environment, significantly affects the rate of upper respiratory infection."
https://openalex.org/W2782237706,"Presence of tubulointerstitial fibrosis is predictive of progressive decline in kidney function, independent of its underlying cause. Injury to the renal microvasculature is a major factor in the progression of fibrosis and identification of factors that regulate endothelium in fibrosis is desirable as they might be candidate targets for treatment of kidney diseases. The current study investigates how loss of Angipoietin-1 (Angpt1), a ligand for endothelial tyrosine-kinase receptor Tek (also called Tie2), affects tubulointerstitial fibrosis and renal microvasculature. Inducible Angpt1 knockout mice were subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) to induce fibrosis, and kidneys were collected at different time points up to 10 days after obstruction. Staining for aSMA showed that Angpt1 deficient kidneys had significantly more fibrosis compared to wildtype mice 3, 6, and 10 days after UUO. Further investigation 3 days after UUO showed a significant increase of Col1a1 and vimentin in Angpt1 deficient mice, as well as increased gene expression of Tgfb1, Col1a1, Fn1, and CD44. Kidney injury molecule 1 (Kim1/Havcr1) was significantly more increased in Angpt1 deficient mice 1 and 3 days after UUO, suggesting a more severe injury early in the fibrotic process in Angpt1 deficient mice. Staining for endomucin showed that capillary rarefaction was evident 3 days after UUO and Angpt1 deficient mice had significantly less capillaries 6 and 10 days after UUO compared to UUO kidneys in wildtype mice. RNA sequencing revealed downregulation of several markers for endothelial cells 3 days after UUO, and that Angpt1 deficient mice had a further downregulation of Emcn, Plvap, Pecam1, Erg, and Tek. Our results suggest that loss of Angpt1 is central in capillary rarefaction and fibrogenesis and propose that manipulations to maintain Angpt1 levels may slow down fibrosis progression."
https://openalex.org/W2782514466,"The present study uses bioenergetics modeling to estimate the annual consumption of the main zooplankton groups by some of the most commercially important planktivorous fish stocks in the Northeast Atlantic, namely Norwegian spring-spawning (NSS) herring (Clupea harengus), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and NEA mackerel (Scomber scombrus). The data was obtained from scientific surveys in the main feeding area (Norwegian Sea) in the period 2005–2010. By incorporating novel information about ambient temperature, seasonal growth and changes in the diet from stomach content analyses, annual consumption of the different zooplankton groups by pelagic fish is estimated. The present study estimates higher consumption estimates than previous studies for the three species and suggests that fish might have a greater impact on the zooplankton community as foragers. This way, NEA mackerel, showing the highest daily consumption rates, and NSS herring, annually consume around 10 times their total biomass, whereas blue whiting consume about 6 times their biomass in zooplankton. The three species were estimated to consume an average of 135 million (M) tonnes of zooplankton each year, consisting of 53–85 M tonnes of copepods, 20–32 M tonnes of krill, 8–42 M tonnes of appendicularians and 0.2–1.2 M tonnes of fish, depending on the year. For NSS herring and NEA mackerel the main prey groups are calanoids and appendicularians, showing a peak in consumption during June and June–July, respectively, and suggesting high potential for inter-specific feeding competition between these species. In contrast, blue whiting maintain a low consumption rate from April to September, consuming mainly larger euphausiids. Our results suggest that the three species can coexist regardless of their high abundance, zooplankton consumption rates and overlapping diet. Accordingly, the species might have niche segregation, as they are species specific, showing annual and inter-annual variability in total consumption of the different prey species. These estimates and their inter-annual and inter-specific variation are fundamental for understanding fundamental pelagic predator-prey interactions as well as to inform advanced multispecies ecosystem models."
https://openalex.org/W2738968909,"Background Osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common bone tumor in children and dogs; however, no substantial improvement in clinical outcome has occurred in either species over the past 30 years. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and play a fundamental role in cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential contribution of miR-34a loss to the biology of canine OSA, a well-established spontaneous model of the human disease. Methodology and principal findings RT-qPCR demonstrated that miR-34a expression levels were significantly reduced in primary canine OSA tumors and canine OSA cell lines as compared to normal canine osteoblasts. In canine OSA cell lines stably transduced with empty vector or pre-miR-34a lentiviral constructs, overexpression of miR-34a inhibited cellular invasion and migration but had no effect on cell proliferation or cell cycle distribution. Transcriptional profiling of canine OSA8 cells possessing enforced miR-34a expression demonstrated dysregulation of numerous genes, including significant down-regulation of multiple putative targets of miR-34a. Moreover, gene ontology analysis of down-regulated miR-34a target genes showed enrichment of several biological processes related to cell invasion and motility. Lastly, we validated changes in miR-34a putative target gene expression, including decreased expression of KLF4, SEM3A, and VEGFA transcripts in canine OSA cells overexpressing miR-34a and identified KLF4 and VEGFA as direct target genes of miR-34a. Concordant with these data, primary canine OSA tumor tissues demonstrated increased expression levels of putative miR-34a target genes. Conclusions These data demonstrate that miR-34a contributes to invasion and migration in canine OSA cells and suggest that loss of miR-34a may promote a pattern of gene expression contributing to the metastatic phenotype in canine OSA."
https://openalex.org/W2781550946,"The integrity and function of the gut is impaired in HIV-infected individuals, and gut pathogenesis may play a role in several HIV-associated disorders. Methamphetamine is a popular illicit drug abused by HIV-infected individuals. However, the effect of methamphetamine on the gut and its potential to exacerbate HIV-associated gut pathology is not known. To shed light on this scenario, we evaluated colon barrier pathology in a rat model of the human comorbid condition. Intestinal barrier integrity and permeability were assessed in drug-naïve Fischer 344 HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) and non-Tg rats, and in Tg and non-Tg rats instrumented with jugular cannulae trained to self-administer methamphetamine or serving as saline-yoked controls. Intestinal permeability was determined by measuring the urine content of orally gavaged sugars. Intestinal barrier integrity was evaluated by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence of colon claudin-1 and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), two major tight junction proteins that regulate gut epithelial paracellular permeability. Both non-Tg and Tg rats self-administered moderate amounts of methamphetamine. These amounts were sufficient to increase colon permeability, reduce protein level of claudin-1, and reduce claudin-1 and ZO-1 immunofluorescence in Tg rats relative to non-Tg rats. Methamphetamine decreased tight junction immunofluorescence in non-Tg rats, with a similar, but non-significant trend observed in Tg rats. However, the effect of methamphetamine on tight junction proteins was subthreshold to gut leakiness. These findings reveal that both HIV-1 proteins and methamphetamine alter colon barrier integrity, and indicate that the gut may be a pathogenic site for these insults."
https://openalex.org/W2782198357,"Image registration is widely used in many fields, but the adaptability of the existing methods is limited. This work proposes a novel image registration method with high precision for various complex applications. In this framework, the registration problem is divided into two stages. First, we detect and describe scale-invariant feature points using modified computer vision-oriented fast and rotated brief (ORB) algorithm, and a simple method to increase the performance of feature points matching is proposed. Second, we develop a new local constraint of rough selection according to the feature distances. Evidence shows that the existing matching techniques based on image features are insufficient for the images with sparse image details. Then, we propose a novel matching algorithm via geometric constraints, and establish local feature descriptions based on geometric invariances for the selected feature points. Subsequently, a new price function is constructed to evaluate the similarities between points and obtain exact matching pairs. Finally, we employ the progressive sample consensus method to remove wrong matches and calculate the space transform parameters. Experimental results on various complex image datasets verify that the proposed method is more robust and significantly reduces the rate of false matches while retaining more high-quality feature points."
https://openalex.org/W2781538922,"Environmental changes associated with modern lifestyles may underlie the rising incidence of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Our previous studies of T1D families and the BioBreeding (BB) rat model have identified a peripheral inflammatory state that is associated with diabetes susceptibility, consistent with pattern recognition receptor ligation, but is independent of disease progression. Here, compared to control strains, islets of spontaneously diabetic BB DRlyp/lyp and diabetes inducible BB DR+/+ weanlings provided a standard cereal diet expressed a robust proinflammatory transcriptional program consistent with microbial antigen exposure that included numerous cytokines/chemokines. The dependence of this phenotype on diet and gastrointestinal microbiota was investigated by transitioning DR+/+ weanlings to a gluten-free hydrolyzed casein diet (HCD) or treating them with antibiotics to alter/reduce pattern recognition receptor ligand exposure. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that these treatments altered the ileal and cecal microbiota, increasing the Firmicutes:Bacteriodetes ratio and the relative abundances of lactobacilli and butyrate producing taxa. While these conditions did not normalize the inherent hyper-responsiveness of DR+/+ rat leukocytes to ex vivo TLR stimulation, they normalized plasma cytokine levels, plasma TLR4 activity levels, the proinflammatory islet transcriptome, and β-cell chemokine expression. In lymphopenic DRlyp/lyp rats, HCD reduced T1D incidence, and the introduction of gluten to this diet induced islet chemokine expression and abrogated protection from diabetes. Overall, these studies link BB rat islet-level immunocyte recruiting potential, as measured by β-cell chemokine expression, to a genetically controlled immune hyper-responsiveness and innate inflammatory state that can be modulated by diet and the intestinal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2782016767,"ing the structure or ‘rules’ underlying observed patterns is central to mature cognition, yet research with infants suggests this far-reaching capacity is initially restricted to certain stimuli. Infants successfully abstract rules from auditory sequences (e.g., language), but fail when the same rules are presented as visual sequences (e.g., shapes). We propose that this apparent gap between rule learning in the auditory and visual modalities reflects the distinct requirements of the perceptual systems that interface with cognition: The auditory system efficiently extracts patterns from sequences structured in time, but the visual system best extracts patterns from sequences structured in space. Here, we provide the first evidence for this proposal with adults in an abstract rule learning task. We then reveal strong developmental continuity: infants as young as 3 months of age also successfully learn abstract rules in the visual modality when sequences are structured in space. This provides the earliest evidence to date of abstract rule learning in any modality."
https://openalex.org/W2781716206,"Purpose Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) is an effective treatment strategy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, the prognoses of patients with portal vein thrombosis, extra-hepatic metastases, or residual tumors remain poor when treated with SIRT alone. In these patients, sequential external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) may offer a chance of salvage. Here, we reported the clinical outcomes and the detailed dosimetry analysis of 22 patients treated with combination therapy. Methods Between October 2011 and May 2015, 22 consecutive patients who underwent EBRT after yttrium-90 (90Y) SIRT were included in this study. The post-SIRT 90Y bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT of each patient was transferred to dose distribution by adopting the local deposition hypothesis. The patient-specific 3-dimensional biological effective dose distribution of combined SIRT and EBRT was generated. The overall survival and safety were evaluated. The relationship between dosimetric parameters and liver toxicity was analyzed. Results The mean administered activity of SIRT was 1.50 GBq (range: 0.5–2.8). The mean prescribed dose of EBRT was 42.3 Gy (range: 15–63) in 14 fractions (range: 5–15) and was targeted to the residual liver tumor in 12 patients (55%), portal vein thrombosis in 11 patients (50%), and perihilar lymphadenopathies in 4 patients (18%). The overall 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 59.8%, 47.9%, and 47.9%, respectively. Overall, 8 patients (36%) developed > grade 2 liver toxicities, and the Child-Pugh score prior to EBRT strongly affected the toxicity risk. A dosimetry analysis restricted to 18 Child-Pugh A/B patients showed that the V100 (The fraction of normal liver exposed to more than 100 Gy) to V140 significance differed between patients who did or did not experience hepatotoxicity. The V110 was the strongest predictor of hepatotoxicity (18.6±11.6% vs 29.5±5.8%; P = 0.030). Conclusion Combined therapy is feasible and safe if patients are carefully selected. Specifically, 3-dimensional dosimetry is crucial for the evaluation of efficacy and toxicity. The normal liver V100 to V140 values of the combined dose should be as low as possible to minimize the risk of liver toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2781587550,"DNA methylation is an important mechanism of epigenetic modification. Methylation changes during stress responses and developmental processes have been well studied; however, their role in plant adaptation to the day/night cycle is poorly understood. In this study, we detected global methylation patterns in leaves of the black poplar Populus nigra ‘N46’ at 8:00 and 24:00 by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq). We found 10,027 and 10,242 genes to be methylated in the 8:00 and 24:00 samples, respectively. The methylated genes appeared to be involved in multiple biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components, suggesting important roles for DNA methylation in poplar cells. Comparing the 8:00 and 24:00 samples, only 440 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) overlapped with genic regions, including 193 hyper- and 247 hypo-methylated DMRs, and may influence the expression of 137 downstream genes. Most hyper-methylated genes were associated with transferase activity, kinase activity, and phosphotransferase activity, whereas most hypo-methylated genes were associated with protein binding, ATP binding, and adenyl ribonucleotide binding, suggesting that different biological processes were activated during the day and night. Our results indicated that methylated genes were prevalent in the poplar genome, but that only a few of these participated in diurnal gene expression regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2781617111,"Little is known of how the stress response varies when animals confront seasonal life-history processes. Antioxidant defenses and damage caused by oxidative stress and their link with immunocompetence are powerful biomarkers to assess animal´s physiological stress response. The aim of this study was A) to determine redox state and variation in basal (pre-acute stress) immune function during summer, autumn and winter (spring was not assessed due to restrictions in collecting permit) in the fish-eating Myotis (Myotis vivesi; Chiroptera), and B) to determine the effect of acute stress on immunocompetence and redox state during each season. Acute stress was stimulated by restricting animal movement for 6 and 12 h. The magnitude of the cellular immune response was higher during winter whilst that of the humoral response was at its highest during summer. Humoral response increased after 6 h of movement restriction stress and returned to baseline levels after 12 h. Basal redox state was maintained throughout the year, with no significant changes in protein damage, and antioxidant activity was modulated mainly in relation to variation to environment cues, increasing during high temperatures and decreasing during windy nights. Antioxidant activity increased after the 6 h of stressful stimuli especially during summer and autumn, and to a lesser extent in early winter, but redox state did not vary. However, protein damage increased after 12 h of stress during summer. Prolonged stress when the bat is engaged in activities of high energy demand overcame its capacity to maintain homeostasis resulting in oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2782128571,"Purpose To investigate the diagnostic performance and incidental lesion yield of 3T breast MRI if used as a problem-solving tool. Methods This retrospective, IRB-approved, cross-sectional, single-center study comprised 302 consecutive women (mean: 50±12 years; range: 20–79 years) who were undergoing 3T breast MRI between 03/2013-12/2014 for further workup of conventional and clinical breast findings. Images were read by experienced, board-certified radiologists. The reference standard was histopathology or follow-up ≥ two years. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were calculated. Results were stratified by conventional and clinical breast findings. Results The reference standard revealed 53 true-positive, 243 true-negative, 20 false-positive, and two false-negative breast MRI findings, resulting in a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 96.4% (53/55), 92.4% (243/263), 72.6% (53/73), and 99.2% (243/245), respectively. In 5.3% (16/302) of all patients, incidental MRI lesions classified BI-RADS 3–5 were detected, 37.5% (6/16) of which were malignant. Breast composition and the imaging findings that had led to referral had no significant influence on the diagnostic performance of breast MR imaging (p>0.05). Conclusion 3T breast MRI yields excellent diagnostic results if used as a problem-solving tool independent of referral reasons. The number of suspicious incidental lesions detected by MRI is low, but is associated with a substantial malignancy rate."
https://openalex.org/W2782203063,"Date palm fruit (Phoenix dactylifera) consumption reduces serum triglyceride levels in human subjects. The objective of this study was to prepare an extract from dates and determine whether it acts as a ligand for the farnesoid x receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor important for maintaining triglyceride and cholesterol homeostasis. Freeze-dried extracts were isolated from California-grown dates (Deglet Noor and Medjool) from the 2014 and 2015 harvests, by means of liquid extraction and solid phase separation. Each date palm extract (DPE) was characterized via HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and the procyanidin content was qualitatively determined. Extracts were tested to determine their ability to modulate nuclear receptor-mediated transactivation using transient transfection. The effect of DPE on FXR-target genes regulating bile acid absorption and transport was then assessed in vitro, in Caco-2 cells. Characterization reveals that DPE is a rich source of polyphenols including hydroxycinnamic acids, proanthocyanidins, and lipohilic polyphenols, and comprises 13% proanthocyanidins. Transactivation results show that DPE acts as a co-agonist ligand for both mouse and human FXR, wherein it activates bile acid-bound FXR greater than that seen with bile acid alone. Additionally, DPE alone activated a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα) chimera in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with DPE as a co-agonist ligand for FXR, studies in Caco-2 cells reveal that co-incubation with bile acid, dose-dependently enhances the expression of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), compared to treatment with bile acid alone. In contrast, DPE inhibited bile acid-induced expression of ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP). Our results demonstrate that DPE acts as a potent co-agonist ligand for FXR, and that it differentially regulates FXR-target gene expression in vitro in human intestinal cells. This study provides novel insight into a potential mechanism by which dates may exert a hypotriglyceridemic effect via FXR and modulation of bile acid homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2781985431,"Reproductive traits are of the utmost importance for any livestock farming, but are difficult to measure and to interpret since they are influenced by various factors. The objective of this study was to detect associations between known polymorphisms in candidate genes related to sexual precocity in Nellore heifers, which could be used in breeding programs. Records of 1,689 precocious and non-precocious heifers from farms participating in the Conexão Delta G breeding program were analyzed. A subset of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located in the region of the candidate genes at a distance of up to 5 kb from the boundaries of each gene, were selected from the panel of 777,000 SNPs of the High-Density Bovine SNP BeadChip. Linear mixed models were used for statistical analysis of early heifer pregnancy, relating the trait with isolated SNPs or with haplotype groups. The model included the contemporary group (year and month of birth) as fixed effect and parent of the animal (sire effect) as random effect. The fastPHASE® and GenomeStudio® were used for reconstruction of the haplotypes and for analysis of linkage disequilibrium based on r2 statistics. A total of 125 candidate genes and 2,024 SNPs forming haplotypes were analyzed. Statistical analysis after Bonferroni correction showed that nine haplotypes exerted a significant effect (p<0.05) on sexual precocity. Four of these haplotypes were located in the Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A2 gene (PAPP-A2), two in the Estrogen-related receptor gamma gene (ESRRG), and one each in the Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A gene (PAPP-A), Kell blood group complex subunit-related family (XKR4) and mannose-binding lectin genes (MBL-1) genes. Although the present results indicate that the PAPP-A2, PAPP-A, XKR4, MBL-1 and ESRRG genes influence sexual precocity in Nellore heifers, further studies are needed to evaluate their possible use in breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2781976574,"There is conflicting data on the role of macrophages in colorectal cancer (CRC); some studies have shown that macrophages can exert an anti-tumor effect whereas others show that macrophages are tumor promoting. We sought to determine the role of conditioned medium (CM) from macrophages, in particular classically activated macrophages, on the development of the CSC phenotype in CRC cells, which is believed to mediate tumor growth and chemoresistance.Murine (CT26) and human (HCP-1) CRC cell lines were treated with CM from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated murine macrophages. The CSC population was assessed using the sphere-forming assay and aldehyde dehydrogenase assay. Chemoresistance studies were performed using the MTT assay. CSC transcription factors and SHH protein were analyzed by Western blotting.The results showed that LPS-activated macrophage CM induced the CSC phenotype in CRC cells. Further studies showed that the CSC phenotype was mediated by the sonic hedgehog (SHH)-Gli signaling pathway, which is known to drive self-renewal; these effects were blocked by depletion of SHH in macrophage CM. In addition, LPS-activated macrophage CM enhanced chemoresistance.LPS-activated macrophages play an active role in promoting the CSC phenotype through activation of the SHH-Gli signaling pathway in CRC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2782030225,"Background Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a rare but serious complication of long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). However, previous studies reported large variations in its mortality rates that may associate with a different degree of EPS severity. This study reports the incidence and outcomes of EPS and identifies the risk factors associated with severe EPS. Methods We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of EPS patients from 3 medical centers in Taiwan from January 1982 to September 2015, and classified patients as having mild/moderate or severe EPS. Patients with intractable intestinal obstruction/gut-related sepsis that needed surgical intervention or resulted in mortality were in severe EPS group. Follow-up for outcome was through December 31, 2015. Clinical characteristics, peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related parameters, biochemical and imaging results were analyzed and compared between groups. Results Fifty-eight of 3202 patients undergoing PD during the study period had EPS (prevalence 1.8%). The incidence of EPS increased for patients on PD for >6–8 years (≤6 yrs. vs. >6–8 yrs., 0.0% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.001). Relative to those on PD for >6–8 years, the risk of EPS significantly increased with PD duration longer than 10 years (>10–12 years vs. >6–8 years: OR: 5.5, 95% CI: 1.7–17.1, p < 0.01). Twenty-three patients fulfilled the criteria for severe EPS. The overall mortality rate of EPS was 35% (20/58), and was 74% (17/23) in the severe EPS group. The average serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and intact-parathyroid hormone (i-PTH), which were checked every 3~6 months within one year before diagnosis of EPS, were higher in severe EPS group than in mild/moderate group (p = 0.02, p = 0.08, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed severe EPS was independently associated with bowel tethering (based on CT), presentation with bloody ascites, diagnosis of EPS after withdrawal from PD, and i-PTH ≥ 384 pg/mL. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that presentation with 2 or more of the 5 risk factors (EPS diagnosis after PD withdrawal, bloody ascites, bowel tethering, CRP ≥ 29 mg/L, and i-PTH ≥ 384 pg/mL) had a good accuracy (AUC = 0.80, p = 0.001) for prediction of severe EPS. Conclusions The incidence of EPS increases with PD duration. Severe EPS has high mortality rate and is associated with bowel tethering, presentation of bloody ascites, diagnosis after PD withdrawal, and higher serum levels of i-PTH before EPS diagnosis. Having 2 or more of the 5 risk factors can provide a good accuracy for prediction of severe EPS."
https://openalex.org/W2782117725,"Vibrio cholerae O1 is one of two serogroups responsible for epidemic cholera, a severe watery diarrhea that occurs after the bacterium colonizes the human small intestine and secretes a potent ADP-ribosylating toxin. Immunity to cholera is associated with intestinal anti-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antibodies, which are known to inhibit V. cholerae motility and promote bacterial cell-cell crosslinking and aggregation. Here we report that V. cholerae O1 classical and El Tor biotypes produce an extracellular matrix (ECM) when forcibly immobilized and agglutinated by ZAC-3 IgG, an intestinally-derived monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the core/lipid A region of LPS. ECM secretion, as demonstrated by crystal violet staining and scanning electron microscopy, occurred within 30 minutes of antibody exposure and peaked by 3 hours. Non-motile mutants of V. cholerae did not secrete ECM following ZAC-3 IgG exposure, even though they were susceptible to agglutination. The ECM was enriched in O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) but not Vibrio polysaccharide (VPS). Finally, we demonstrate that ECM production by V. cholerae in response to ZAC-3 IgG was associated with bacterial resistant to a secondary complement-mediated attack. In summary, we propose that V. cholerae O1, upon encountering anti-LPS antibodies in the intestinal lumen, secretes an ECM (or O-antigen capsule) possibly as a strategy to shield itself from additional host immune factors and to exit an otherwise inhospitable host environment."
https://openalex.org/W2781520421,"Biosurfactants have several desirable characteristics in the industrial sector: detergency, antimicrobial effects, skin hydration, and emulsibility. Several yeast glycolipids are currently being utilized in these capacities: sophorolipids, ustilagic acid, and mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs). An emerging class of glycolipids, termed polyol esters of fatty acids (PEFA), have recently been reported for Rhodotorula babjevae, a basidiomycetous yeast species that secretes hyperacetylated congeners of PEFA (typically with 3–6 acetylation modifications). While screening Rhodotorula species for surfactant production, we identified a new environmental isolate identified as Rhodotorula taiwanensis MD1149 that dropped the surface tension of the liquid medium, indicating that it produced a potent biosurfactant. Acid depolymerization of the purified biosurfactants, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that the biosurfactants were composed of PEFA compounds composed mainly of mannitol and arabitol esters of 3-hydroxy fatty acid, 3-methoxy fatty acid, and fatty acids with a single double bond; chain lengths were mainly C16 and C18. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) confirmed the predicted accurate mass of these compounds. Interestingly, PEFA compounds produced by Rhodotorula taiwanensis MD1149 were more surface active due to their hypoacetylation profile (0–4 acetylation modifications) compared to Rhodotorula babjevae MD1169. These disparate surface active properties, based on acetylation, change the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of these compounds, and their potential utility within industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W2781816106,"Compelling evidence that many biological soft tissues display both strain- and time-dependent behavior has led to the development of fully non-linear viscoelastic modeling techniques to represent the tissue's mechanical response under dynamic conditions. Since the current stress state of a viscoelastic material is dependent on all previous loading events, numerical analyses are complicated by the requirement of computing and storing the stress at each step throughout the load history. This requirement quickly becomes computationally expensive, and in some cases intractable, for finite element models. Therefore, we have developed a strain-dependent numerical integration approach for capturing non-linear viscoelasticity that enables calculation of the current stress from a strain-dependent history state variable stored from the preceding time step only, which improves both fitting efficiency and computational tractability. This methodology was validated based on its ability to recover non-linear viscoelastic coefficients from simulated stress-relaxation (six strain levels) and dynamic cyclic (three frequencies) experimental stress-strain data. The model successfully fit each data set with average errors in recovered coefficients of 0.3% for stress-relaxation fits and 0.1% for cyclic. The results support the use of the presented methodology to develop linear or non-linear viscoelastic models from stress-relaxation or cyclic experimental data of biological soft tissues."

Despite the increasing number of solutions based on the openEHR specifications, it is difficult to find publicly available healthcare datasets in the openEHR format that can be used to test, compare and validate different data persistence mechanisms for openEHR. To foster research on openEHR servers, we present the openEHR Benchmark Dataset, ORBDA, a very large healthcare benchmark dataset encoded using the openEHR formalism. To construct ORBDA, we extracted and cleaned a de-identified dataset from the Brazilian National Healthcare System (SUS) containing hospitalisation and high complexity procedures information and formalised it using a set of openEHR archetypes and templates. Then, we implemented a tool to enrich the raw relational data and convert it into the openEHR model using the openEHR Java reference model library. The ORBDA dataset is available in composition, versioned composition and EHR openEHR representations in XML and JSON formats. In total, the dataset contains more than 150 million composition records. We describe the dataset and provide means to access it. Additionally, we demonstrate the usage of ORBDA for evaluating inserting throughput and query latency performances of some NoSQL database management systems. We believe that ORBDA is a valuable asset for assessing storage models for openEHR-based information systems during the software engineering process. It may also be a suitable component in future standardised benchmarking of available openEHR storage platforms."

A study was conducted in El Nido, Palawan, Philippines to: (i) detect the true incidence of animal bites in school children aged 5-14 years using active surveillance and compare these data to estimates from the existing passive surveillance system, (ii) evaluate the impact of rabies prevention education and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) on animal bite incidence, and (iii) assess the health economic impact of the interventions.A cohort of 4,700 school children was followed-up for any suspect rabies exposures between January 2011 and December 2012. Data on animal bite incidence from the study cohort were compared to that obtained from a review of consultation records at the Animal Bite Treatment Center (ABTC). PrEP was offered to children in all 27 public elementary schools in El Nido (in January to February 2012). Teachers were given a manual for integrating rabies in the public elementary school curriculum during the school year 2012-13. Active surveillance of the cohort revealed a higher incidence of suspect rabies exposures than that from passive surveillance. Despite a decrease in the number of Category III bites, there was no significant decrease in overall bite incidence as a result of the interventions. However, there was an increase in rabies awareness among school children in all grade levels. There was also a high level of acceptability of PrEP. Children who received PrEP and subsequently were bitten only needed two booster doses for post-exposure prophylaxis, resulting in substantial cost-savings.The true burden of animal bites remains underestimated in ABTC records. PrEP is advantageous in selected population groups, i.e. school-aged children in rabies endemic areas with limited access to animal and human rabies prevention services. Educating school children is beneficial. Strengthening veterinary interventions to target the disease at source is important."
https://openalex.org/W2782443805,"Recombinant protein therapeutics have become important components of the modern medicine. Majority of them are produced with mammalian cells that are cultured either through adherent culturing, in which cells are cultured on substrates, or suspension culturing, in which cells are suspended and cultured in agitated cell culture medium in a culture vessel. The adherent cell culturing method is limited by its low yield. In suspension culturing, cells need extensive genetic manipulation to grow as single cells at high density, which is time- and labor-consuming. Here, we report a new method, which utilizes a thermoreversible hydrogel as the scaffold for culturing protein-expressing cells. The hydrogel scaffolds not only provide 3D spaces for the cells, but also act as physical barriers to prevent excessive cellular agglomeration and protect cells from the hydrodynamic stresses. As a result, cells can grow at high viability, high growth rate, and extremely high yield even without genetic manipulations. The cell yield in the hydrogels is around 20 times of the suspension culturing. In addition, the protein productivity per cell per day in the hydrogel is higher than the adherent culturing method. This new method is simple, scalable and defined. It will be of great value for both the research laboratories and pharmaceutical industry for producing proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2781907349,"Background Our previously published CUDA-only application PaSWAS for Smith-Waterman (SW) sequence alignment of any type of sequence on NVIDIA-based GPUs is platform-specific and therefore adopted less than could be. The OpenCL language is supported more widely and allows use on a variety of hardware platforms. Moreover, there is a need to promote the adoption of parallel computing in bioinformatics by making its use and extension more simple through more and better application of high-level languages commonly used in bioinformatics, such as Python. Results The novel application pyPaSWAS presents the parallel SW sequence alignment code fully packed in Python. It is a generic SW implementation running on several hardware platforms with multi-core systems and/or GPUs that provides accurate sequence alignments that also can be inspected for alignment details. Additionally, pyPaSWAS support the affine gap penalty. Python libraries are used for automated system configuration, I/O and logging. This way, the Python environment will stimulate further extension and use of pyPaSWAS. Conclusions pyPaSWAS presents an easy Python-based environment for accurate and retrievable parallel SW sequence alignments on GPUs and multi-core systems. The strategy of integrating Python with high-performance parallel compute languages to create a developer- and user-friendly environment should be considered for other computationally intensive bioinformatics algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2782102616,"Dendritic cell (DC)-to-T cell transmission is an example of infection in trans, in which the cell transmitting the virus is itself uninfected. During this mode of DC-to-T cell transmission, uninfected DCs concentrate infectious virions, contact T cells and transmit these virions to target cells. Here, we investigated the efficiency of DC-to-T cell transmission on the number of cells infected and the sensitivity of this type of transmission to the antiretroviral drugs tenofovir (TFV) and raltegravir (RAL). We observed activated monocyte-derived and myeloid DCs amplified T cell infection, which resulted in drug insensitivity. This drug insensitivity was dependent on cell-to-cell contact and ratio of DCs to T cells in coculture. DC-mediated amplification of HIV-1 infection was efficient regardless of virus tropism or origin. The DC-to-T cell transmission of the T/F strain CH077.t/2627 was relatively insensitive to TFV compared to DC-free T cell infection. The input of virus modulated the drug sensitivity of DC-to-T cell infection, but not T cell infection by cell-free virus. At high viral inputs, DC-to-T cell transmission reduced the sensitivity of infection to TFV. Transmission of HIV by DCs in trans may have important implications for viral persistence in vivo in environments, where residual replication may persist in the face of antiretroviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2782405393,"Body temperature rhythms synchronize circadian oscillations in different tissues, depending on the degree of cellular coupling: the responsiveness to temperature is higher when single circadian oscillators are uncoupled. So far, the role of coupling in temperature responsiveness has only been studied in organotypic tissue slices of the central circadian pacemaker, because it has been assumed that peripheral target organs behave like uncoupled multicellular oscillators. Since recent studies indicate that some peripheral tissues may exhibit cellular coupling as well, we asked whether peripheral network dynamics also influence temperature responsiveness. Using a novel technique for long-term, high-resolution bioluminescence imaging of primary cultured cells, exposed to repeated temperature cycles, we were able to quantitatively measure period, phase, and amplitude of central (suprachiasmatic nuclei neuron dispersals) and peripheral (mouse ear fibroblasts) single cell oscillations in response to temperature. Employing temperature cycles of different lengths, and different cell densities, we found that some circadian characteristics appear cell-autonomous, e.g. period responses, while others seem to depend on the quality/degree of cellular communication, e.g. phase relationships, robustness of the oscillation, and amplitude. Overall, our findings indicate a strong dependence on the cell’s ability for intercellular communication, which is not only true for neuronal pacemakers, but, importantly, also for cells in peripheral tissues. Hence, they stress the importance of comparative studies that evaluate the degree of coupling in a given tissue, before it may be used effectively as a target for meaningful circadian manipulation."

Although they are prevalent, little is known about their epidemiology and effect on the immune response. This study evaluated the effect of enteroparasite co-infections with malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax in a border area between Brazil and French Guiana. The cross sectional study took place in Oiapoque, a municipality of Amapá, on the Amazon border. Malaria was diagnosed using thick blood smears, haemoglobin dosage by an automated method and coproparasitology by the Hoffman and Faust methods. The anti-PvMSP-119 IgG antibodies in the plasma were evaluated using ELISA and Th1 (IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2), and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10) cytokine counts were performed by flow cytometry. The participants were grouped into those that were monoinfected with vivax malaria (M), vivax malaria-enteroparasite co-infected (CI), monoinfected with enteroparasite (E) and endemic controls (EC), who were negative for both diseases. 441 individuals were included and grouped according to their infection status: [M 6.9% (30/441)], [Cl 26.5% (117/441)], [E 32.4% (143/441)] and [EC 34.2% (151/441)]. Males prevailed among the (M) 77% (23/30) and (CI) 60% (70/117) groups. There was a difference in haemoglobin levels among the different groups under study for [EC-E], [EC-Cl], [E-M] and [Cl-M], with (p < 0.01). Anaemia was expressed as a percentage between individuals [CI-EC (p < 0.05)]. In terms of parasitaemia, there were differences for the groups [CI-M (p < 0.05)]. Anti-PvMSP-119 antibodies were detected in 51.2% (226/441) of the population. The level of cytokines evaluation revealed a large variation in TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations in the co-infected group. In this study we did not observe any influence of coinfection on the acquisition of IgG antibodies against PvMSP119, as well as on the profile of the cytokines that characterize the Th1 and Th2 patterns. However, co-infection increased TNF-α and IL-10 levels."
https://openalex.org/W2782376887,"Complex and interacting selective pressures can produce bacterial communities with a range of phenotypes. One measure of bacterial success is the ability of cells or populations to proliferate while avoiding lytic phage infection. Resistance against bacteriophage infection can occur in the form of a metabolically expensive exopolysaccharide capsule. Here, we show that in Caulobacter crescentus, presence of an exopolysaccharide capsule provides measurable protection against infection from a lytic paracrystalline S-layer bacteriophage (CR30), but at a metabolic cost that reduces success in a phage-free environment. Carbon flux through GDP-mannose 4,6 dehydratase in different catabolic and anabolic pathways appears to mediate this trade-off. Together, our data support a model in which diversity in bacterial communities may be maintained through variable selection on phenotypes utilizing the same metabolic pathway."

However, the capacity of rTth polymerase, which acts as DNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase, to detect RNA in the presence of various inhibitors has not been investigated in detail. Herein, the inhibitors originating from various clinical samples such as blood, urine, feces, bodily fluids, tissues and reagents used during nucleic acid extraction were employed to evaluate the capacity of rTth polymerase to detect RNA. The results show that the inhibitors have different inhibitory effects on the real-time RT-PCR reactions by rTth polymerase, and the inhibitory effects are concentration dependent. Additionally, the capacity of rTth polymerase to detect RNA in the presence of various inhibitors is better or at least comparable with its capacity to detect DNA in the presence of various inhibitors. As a consequence, RNA may be directly detected in the presence of co-purified inhibitors or even directly from crude clinical samples by rTth polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2781480719,"Objective Joint fibrosis affects many synovial joints (including hip, knee and shoulder) causing stiffness and pain. The mechanism of joint fibrosis remains unknown, although genetic factors may contribute. Defects in maintenance of telomere length resulting from impaired telomere repair have been shown to cause lung and liver fibrotic disease. Here we tested the hypothesis that joint fibrosis and other soft tissue fibrotic conditions are also associated with telomere length. Patients and methods 5,200 participants in the TwinsUK registry had data on telomere length (measured by qPCR) and the traits of interest (hip and knee stiffness, total joint replacement (TJR, hip or knee) and fibrotic conditions (Dupuytren’s disease, frozen shoulder). Results Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed a significant association between telomere length and fibrotic conditions (hip stiffness, knee stiffness and frozen shoulder, p = ≤0.002) even after taking age into account. No association was found between TJR and telomere length. Conclusion These findings suggest that defects in telomere repair contribute to joint fibrosis, and that fibrosis shares a common mechanistic pathway in different organs. Therapeutic strategies to combat telomere shortening may offer novel treatments for fibrotic joint disease."

The VQ algorithm has been shown to be an effective method for generating features; it extracts a codevector histogram as a facial feature representation for face recognition. Still, the VQ histogram features are unable to convey spatial structural information, which to some extent limits their usefulness in discrimination. To alleviate this limitation of VQ histograms, we utilize Markov stationary features (MSF) to extend the VQ histogram-based features so as to add spatial structural information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm by achieving recognition results superior to those of several state-of-the-art methods on publicly available face databases."
https://openalex.org/W2781889459,"Background Taiwan had been considered rabies free since 1961, until a newly established wildlife disease surveillance program identified rabies virus transmission within the Formosan ferret-badger (Melogale moschata subaurantiaca) in 2013. Ferret-badgers occur throughout southern China and Southeast Asia, but their ecological niche is not well described. Methodology/Principle findings As an initial feasibility assessment for potential rabies control measures, field camera trapping and pen assessment of 6 oral rabies vaccine (ORV) baits were conducted in Taiwan in 2013. 46 camera nights were recorded; 6 Formosan ferret-badgers and 14 non-target mammals were sighted. No baits were consumed by ferret-badgers and 8 were consumed by non-target mammals. Penned ferret-badgers ingested 5 of the 18 offered baits. When pen and field trials were combined, and analyzed for palatability, ferret-badgers consumed 1 of 9 marshmallow baits (11.1%), 1 of 21 fishmeal baits (4.8%), 0 of 3 liver baits, and 3 of 3 fruit-flavored baits. It took an average of 261 minutes before ferret-badgers made oral contact with the non-fruit flavored baits, and 34 minutes for first contact with the fruit-based bait. Overall, ferret-badgers sought out the fruit baits 8 times faster, spent a greater proportion of time eating fruit baits, and were 7.5 times more likely to have ruptured the vaccine container of the fruit-based bait. Conclusions/Significance Ferret-badgers are now recognized as rabies reservoir species in China and Taiwan, through two independent ‘dog to ferret-badger’ host-shift events. Species of ferret-badgers can be found throughout Indochina, where they may be an unrecognized rabies reservoir. Findings from this initial study underscore the need for further captive and field investigations of fruit-based attractants or baits developed for small meso-carnivores. Non-target mammals’ competition for baits, ants, bait design, and dense tropical landscape represent potential challenges to effective ORV programs that will need to be considered in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2782418674,"In the present study, we applied Machine Learning (ML) methods to identify psychobiological markers of cognitive processes involved in the process of emotion elicitation as postulated by the Component Process Model (CPM). In particular, we focused on the automatic detection of five appraisal checks-novelty, intrinsic pleasantness, goal conduciveness, control, and power-in electroencephalography (EEG) and facial electromyography (EMG) signals. We also evaluated the effects on classification accuracy of averaging the raw physiological signals over different numbers of trials, and whether the use of minimal sets of EEG channels localized over specific scalp regions of interest are sufficient to discriminate between appraisal checks. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on two data sets obtained from previous studies. Our results show that novelty and power appraisal checks can be consistently detected in EEG signals above chance level (binary tasks). For novelty, the best classification performance in terms of accuracy was achieved using features extracted from the whole scalp, and by averaging across 20 individual trials in the same experimental condition (UAR = 83.5 ± 4.2; N = 25). For power, the best performance was obtained by using the signals from four pre-selected EEG channels averaged across all trials available for each participant (UAR = 70.6 ± 5.3; N = 24). Together, our results indicate that accurate classification can be achieved with a relatively small number of trials and channels, but that averaging across a larger number of individual trials is beneficial for the classification for both appraisal checks. We were not able to detect any evidence of the appraisal checks under study in the EMG data. The proposed methodology is a promising tool for the study of the psychophysiological mechanisms underlying emotional episodes, and their application to the development of computerized tools (e.g., Brain-Computer Interface) for the study of cognitive processes involved in emotions."

The objectives of this study were to assess time to clinical response, the incidence density for clinical response and determinants of clinical response of tuberculosis (TB) patients in the intensive phases of TB treatment. Prospective cohort study design was implemented. The target population for this study was all patients following the directly observed therapy. Baseline data has been collected during the start of the directly observed TB treatment strategy. We have been collected updated data after the seven days of the baseline data collection, then after every seven days updated data has been collected from each pulmonary and extra pulmonary TB patients. Kaplan Meier curve was used to estimate time to clinical response. Incidence density using person days was used to estimate incidence of clinical response. Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify the predictors of clinical responses. A total of 1608 TB patients were included with a response rate at 99.5%. The mean age of the respondents was 24.5 years [standard deviation (SD) 14.34 years]. The incidence density for clinical response was 1429/38529 person days. One fourth of the TB patients showed clinical response at day 14, 25% of at day 21 and 75% o at day 31. Predictors of clinical response for TB patients includes: age (AHR 1.007 [95% CI 1.003-1.011]), type of TB (AOR 2.3[95% CI 2.04-2.59]), Previous history of TB (AHR 0.18 [95% CI 0.11-0 .30]), Intestinal parasitic infection (AOR 0.22[95% CI 0.19-0.26]), hemoglobin (AOR 2.35 [95% CI 2.18-2.54]), weight gain (AOR 1.11 [95% CI 1.05-1.17]), Micronutrient supplementation (AOR 9.71 [95% CI 8.28-11.38]), male sex (AOR 0.87 [95% CI 0.79-0.97]).The clinical responses for extra-pulmonary TB patients were slower than pulmonary TB. Deworming and micronutrient supplementation should be considered as the additional TB treatment strategy for TB patients."
https://openalex.org/W2782347190,"The saturation of the domestic market is one of the factors which drive firms to expand their business to other markets. Franchising is one of the formats adopted by companies when establishing their internationalization strategy. Spain is a country where franchising is strongly consolidated. This degree of maturity means that many chains seek other countries in which to operate. This work's specific aims are, on the one hand, to offer a general view of the current situation of Spanish franchisors in Latin American countries and, on the other hand, to analyze which the socio-economic or external factors are that determine the presence of Spanish franchisors in this market. Canonical-correlation analysis is used to do so. The results show that Spanish franchisors focus on the market's potential and size, and the per capita income, while they do not take into account its unemployment level, the country risk or the competitiveness there. This work shows that there is a series of socio-economic factors which influence the final choice of the destination country. However, this decision is not solely based on this country's socio-economic aspects, but also on the structure of the franchising firm itself and on its export experience in other markets. This study therefore complements other research and helps franchisors in their difficult decision of choosing the destination for their internationalization."
https://openalex.org/W2781744229,"Since 1976, the United States has seen over 1,400 judicial executions, and these have been highly concentrated in only a few states and counties. The number of executions across counties appears to fit a stretched distribution. These distributions are typically reflective of self-reinforcing processes where the probability of observing an event increases for each previous event. To examine these processes, we employ two-pronged empirical strategy. First, we utilize bootstrapped Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to determine whether the pattern of executions reflect a stretched distribution, and confirm that they do. Second, we test for event-dependence using the Conditional Frailty Model. Our tests estimate the monthly hazard of an execution in a given county, accounting for the number of previous executions, homicides, poverty, and population demographics. Controlling for other factors, we find that the number of prior executions in a county increases the probability of the next execution and accelerates its timing. Once a jurisdiction goes down a given path, the path becomes self-reinforcing, causing the counties to separate out into those never executing (the vast majority of counties) and those which use the punishment frequently. This finding is of great legal and normative concern, and ultimately, may not be consistent with the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution."
https://openalex.org/W2782270622,"Damaged DNA Binding 1 (DDB1)—binding WD40 (DWD) proteins are highly conserved and involved in a plethora of developmental and physiological processes such as flowering time control, photomorphogenesis, and abiotic stress responses. The phylogeny of this family of proteins in plants and algae of viridiplante is a critical area to understand the emergence of this family in such important and diverse functions. We aimed to investigate the putative homologs of DWD in the viridiplante and establish a deeper DWD evolutionary grasp. The advancement in publicly available genomic data allowed us to perform an extensive genome-wide DWD retrieval. Using annotated Arabidopsis thaliana DWDs as the reference, we generated and characterized a comprehensive DWD database for the studied photoautotrophs. Further, a generic DWD classification system (Type A to K), based on (i) position of DWD motifs, (ii) number of DWD motifs, and (iii) presence/absence of other domains, was adopted. About 72–80% DWDs have one DWD motif, whereas 17–24% DWDs have two and 0.5–4.7% DWDs have three DWD motifs. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic construction of A. thaliana DWDs facilitated us to tune these substrate receptors into 15 groups. Though the DWD count increases from microalgae to higher land plants, the ratio of DWD to WD40 remained constant throughout the viridiplante. The DWD expansion appeared to be the consequence of consistent DWD genetic flow accompanied by several gene duplication events. The network, phylogenetic, and statistical analysis delineated DWD evolutionary relevance in the viridiplante."
https://openalex.org/W2782082691,"Background 
Scaling up the antiretroviral (ART) program in Kenya has involved a strategy of using clinical guidelines coupled with decentralization of treatment sites. However decentralization pushes clinical responsibility downwards to health facilities run by lower cadre staff. Whether the organizational culture in health facilities affects the outcomes despite the use of clinical guidelines has not been explored. This study aimed to demonstrate the relationship between organizational culture and early mortality and those lost to follow up (LTFU) among patients enrolled for HIV care.


Methods and materials 
A stratified sample of 31 health facilities in Nairobi County offering ART services were surveyed. Data of patients enrolled on ART and LTFU for the 12 months ending 30th June 2013 were abstracted. Mortality and LTFU were determined and used to rank health facilities. In the facilities with the lowest and highest mortality and LTFU key informant interviews were conducted using a tool adapted from team climate assessment measurement questionnaire and competing value framework tool to assess organizational culture. The strength of association between early mortality, LTFU and organizational culture was tested.


Results 
Half (51.8%) of the 5,808 patients enrolled into care in 31 health facilities over the 12-month study period were started on ART. Of these 48 (1.6% 95% CI 0.8%-2.4%) died within three months of starting treatment, while a further 125 (4.2% 95% CI 2.1%-6.6%) were LTFU giving an attrition rate of 5.7% (95% CI 3.3%-8.6%). Tuberculosis was the most common comorbidity associated with high early mortality and high LTFU. Organizational culture, specifically an adhocratic type was found to be associated with low early mortality and low LTFU of patients enrolled for HIV care (P = 0.034).


Conclusion 
The use of ART clinical guidelines in a decentralized health systems are not sufficient to achieve required service delivery outcomes. The attrition rate above would mean 85,000 Kenyans missing care based on current HIV disease burden figures. Deliberate efforts to improve individual health facility leadership and inculcate an adhocratic culture may lower mortality and morbidity associated with initiating ART."
