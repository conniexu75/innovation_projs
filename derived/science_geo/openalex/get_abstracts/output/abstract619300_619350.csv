Here we genotyped 312,571 MVP participants using a custom biobank array and linked the genetic data to laboratory and clinical phenotypes extracted from electronic health records covering a median of 10.0 years of follow-up. Among 297,626 veterans with at least one blood lipid measurement, including 57,332 black and 24,743 Hispanic participants, we tested up to around 32 million variants for association with lipid levels and identified 118 novel genome-wide significant loci after meta-analysis with data from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (total n > 600,000). Through a focus on mutations predicted to result in a loss of gene function and a phenome-wide association study, we propose novel indications for pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting PCSK9 (abdominal aortic aneurysm), ANGPTL4 (type 2 diabetes) and PDE3B (triglycerides and coronary disease). Analysis of genetic data and blood lipid measurements from over 300,000 participants in the Million Veteran Program identifies new associations for blood lipid traits."

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified sequence variants for CKD; however, the biological basis of these GWAS results remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we created an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) atlas for the glomerular and tubular compartments of the human kidney. Through integrating the CKD GWAS with eQTL, single-cell RNA sequencing and regulatory region maps, we identified novel genes for CKD. Putative causal genes were enriched for proximal tubule expression and endolysosomal function, where DAB2, an adaptor protein in the TGF-β pathway, formed a central node. Functional experiments confirmed that reducing Dab2 expression in renal tubules protected mice from CKD. In conclusion, compartment-specific eQTL analysis is an important avenue for the identification of novel genes and cellular pathways involved in CKD development and thus potential new opportunities for its treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2894305622,"We report full-length draft de novo genome assemblies for 16 widely used inbred mouse strains and find extensive strain-specific haplotype variation. We identify and characterize 2,567 regions on the current mouse reference genome exhibiting the greatest sequence diversity. These regions are enriched for genes involved in pathogen defence and immunity and exhibit enrichment of transposable elements and signatures of recent retrotransposition events. Combinations of alleles and genes unique to an individual strain are commonly observed at these loci, reflecting distinct strain phenotypes. We used these genomes to improve the mouse reference genome, resulting in the completion of 10 new gene structures. Also, 62 new coding loci were added to the reference genome annotation. These genomes identified a large, previously unannotated, gene (Efcab3-like) encoding 5,874 amino acids. Mutant Efcab3-like mice display anomalies in multiple brain regions, suggesting a possible role for this gene in the regulation of brain development."
https://openalex.org/W2894083637,"Galaxies are surrounded by large reservoirs of gas, mostly hydrogen, fed by inflows from the intergalactic medium and by outflows due to galactic winds. Absorption-line measurements along the sightlines to bright and rare background quasars indicate that this circumgalactic medium pervades far beyond the extent of starlight in galaxies, but very little is known about the spatial distribution of this gas. A new window into circumgalactic environments was recently opened with the discovery of ubiquitous extended Lyman-alpha emission from hydrogen around high-redshift galaxies, facilitated by the extraordinary sensitivity of the MUSE instrument at the ESO Very Large Telescope. Due to the faintness of this emission, such measurements were previously limited to especially favourable systems or to massive statistical averaging. Here we demonstrate that low surface brightness Lyman-alpha emission surrounding faint galaxies at redshifts between 3 and 6 adds up to a projected sky coverage of nearly 100%. The corresponding rate of incidence (the mean number of Lyman-alpha emitters penetrated by any arbitrary line of sight) is well above unity and similar to the incidence rate of high column density absorbers frequently detected in the spectra of distant quasars. This similarity suggests that most circumgalactic atomic hydrogen at these redshifts has now been detected also in emission."

https://openalex.org/W2895280560,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains the leading cause of gastrointestinal morbidity and mortality in premature infants. Human and animal studies suggest a role for Paneth cells in NEC pathogenesis. Paneth cells play critical roles in host-microbial interactions and epithelial homeostasis. The ramifications of eliminating Paneth cell function on the immature host-microbial axis remains incomplete. Paneth cell function was depleted in the immature murine intestine using chemical and genetic models, which resulted in intestinal injury consistent with NEC. Paneth cell depletion was confirmed using histology, electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and real time RT-PCR. Cecal samples were analyzed at various time points to determine the effects of Paneth cell depletion with and without Klebsiella gavage on the microbiome. Deficient Paneth cell function induced significant compositional changes in the cecal microbiome with a significant increase in Enterobacteriacae species. Further, the bloom of Enterobacteriaceae species that occurs is phenotypically similar to what is seen in human NEC. This further strengthens our understanding of the importance of Paneth cells to intestinal homeostasis in the immature intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2894888786,"VEGFA and TGF-β are known major angiogenic and fibrogenic factors. Galectin-1, encoded by lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble ( LGALS) 1, has attracted growing attention for its facilitatory role in angiogenesis and fibrosis through its modification of VEGFA and TGF-β receptor signaling pathways. We reveal galectin-1 involvement in the mouse model of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and subretinal fibrosis, both of which represent the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Neither deletion nor overexpression of Lgals1 affected physiologic retinal development or visual function. Galectin-1/ Lgals1 was upregulated by CNV induction, whereas deletion of Lgals1 suppressed CNV together with downstream molecules of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)2. Loss of Lgals1 also attenuated subretinal fibrosis, expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers including Snai1, and phosphorylation of SMAD family member 2. Supporting these in vivo findings, silencing of LGALS1 in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells inhibited TGF-β1-induced EMT-related molecules and cell motilities. Conversely, overexpression of Lgals1 enhanced CNV and subretinal fibrosis. Specimens from patients with AMD demonstrated colocalization of galectin-1 with VEGFR2 in neovascular endothelial cells and with phosphorylated SMAD2 in RPE cells. These results suggested a biologic significance of galectin-1 as a key promotor for both angiogenesis and fibrosis in eyes with AMD.-Wu, D., Kanda, A., Liu, Y., Kase, S., Noda, K., Ishida, S.

In a social affective preference test, experimental rats, when given the choice to explore an unfamiliar stressed or a naive adult, will avoid interaction with a stressed conspecific. To determine if familiarity would influence social interactions with stressed conspecifics, male and female test rats underwent 2 social affective preference tests in isosexual triads where an experimental rat was presented with a naïve and a stressed target conspecific who were either familiar (cagemate) or unfamiliar. Male and female experimental rats avoided stressed unfamiliar conspecifics. However, experimental female rats demonstrated a preference to interact with their stressed, familiar cagemates. Male and female rats exhibited more self-grooming and immobility behavior in the presence of stressed conspecifics, which may indicate emotion contagion. These findings suggest a sex-specific role of familiarity in social approach and avoidance, and warrant further mechanistic exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2895232740,"Detailed understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling adipogenesis is of great importance to identify new targets for treating obesity. Emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may play a pivotal role in adipogenesis. Here, we have identified a novel lncRNA, Plnc1, which is transcribed from a position ~25,000 bp upstream of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2(PPAR-γ2) gene. Plnc1 is abundantly expressed in adipose tissue, and obese mice have higher Plnc1 expression in adipose tissue than nonobese mice. Plnc1 was induced in established adipogenic lines ST2, 3T3-L1, and C3H10T1/2 as well as in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) after adipogenic treatment. Plnc1 knockdown blocked differentiation of ST2 cells and BMSCs into mature adipocytes, along with the reduction of PPAR-γ, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α, and adipocyte protein 2. Conversely, overexpression of Plnc1 promoted ST2 cells and BMSCs to fully differentiate. Mechanism studies revealed that Plnc1 could reduce the methylation level of CpG region in the PPAR-γ2 promoter and enhance the transcriptional activity of the promoter and thereby increase PPAR-γ2 transcription. Our study suggests that Plnc1 promotes adipogenic differentiation through controlling the key adipogenic transcription factor PPAR-g and highlights the potential of Plnc1 as a target for new therapies to control metabolic disorders like obesity.—Zhu, E., Zhang, J., Li, Y., Yuan, H., Zhou, J., Wang, B.

https://openalex.org/W2895235691,"KRAS and HRAS are highly homologous oncogenic Ras GTPase family members that are mutated in a wide spectrum of human cancers. Despite having high amino acid identity, KRAS and HRAS have very different codon usage biases: the HRAS gene contains many common codons, and KRAS is enriched for rare codons. Rare codons in KRAS suppress its protein expression, which has been shown to affect both normal and cancer biology in mammals. Here, using HRAS or KRAS expression in different human cell lines and in vitro transcription and translation assays, we show that KRAS rare codons inhibit both translation efficiency and transcription and that the contribution of these two processes varies among different cell lines. We observed that codon usage regulates mRNA translation efficiency such that WT KRAS mRNA is poorly translated. On the other hand, common codons increased transcriptional rates by promoting activating histone modifications and recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. Finally, we found that codon usage also influences KRAS protein conformation, likely because of its effect on co-translational protein folding. Together, our results reveal that codon usage has multidimensional effects on protein expression, ranging from effects on transcription to protein folding in human cells.

https://openalex.org/W2894611133,"NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) transcription factor has a fundamental role in cell homeostasis maintenance as one of the master regulators of oxidative and electrophilic stress responses. Previous studies have shown that a regulatory connection exists between NRF2 and autophagy during reactive oxygen species-generated oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate how autophagy is turned off during prolonged oxidative stress, to avoid overeating and destruction of essential cellular components. AMPK is a key cellular energy sensor highly conserved in eukaryotic organisms, and it has an essential role in autophagy activation at various stress events. Here the role of human AMPK and its Caenorhabditis elegans counterpart AAK-2 was explored upon oxidative stress. We investigated the regulatory connection between NRF2 and AMPK during oxidative stress induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in HEK293T cells and C. elegans. Putative conserved NRF2/protein skinhead-1 binding sites were found in AMPK/aak-2 genes by in silico analysis and were later confirmed experimentally by using EMSA. After addition of TBHP, NRF2 and AMPK showed a quick activation; AMPK was later down-regulated, however, while NRF2 level remained high. Autophagosome formation and Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 phosphorylation were initially stimulated, but they returned to basal values after 4 h of TBHP treatment. The silencing of NRF2 resulted in a constant activation of AMPK leading to hyperactivation of autophagy during oxidative stress. We observed the same effects in C. elegans demonstrating the conservation of this self-defense mechanism to save cells from hyperactivated autophagy upon prolonged oxidative stress. We conclude that NRF2 negatively regulates autophagy through delayed down-regulation of the expression of AMPK upon prolonged oxidative stress. This regulatory connection between NRF2 and AMPK may have an important role in understanding how autophagy is regulated in chronic human morbidities characterized by oxidative stress, such as neurodegenerative diseases, certain cancer types, and in metabolic diseases.-Kosztelnik, M., Kurucz, A., Papp, D., Jones, E., Sigmond, T., Barna, J., Traka, M.

https://openalex.org/W2894767185,"Background In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), cardiac manifestations, e.g. coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocarditis are leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of subclinical heart disease in SLE is unknown. We studied whether a comprehensive cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) protocol may be useful for early diagnosis of heart disease in SLE patients without known CAD. Methods In this prospective, observational, cross-sectional study CMR including cine, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and stress perfusion sequences, ECG, and blood sampling were performed in 30 consecutive SLE patients without known CAD. All patients fulfilled at least 4/11 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Criteria for the classification of SLE. Results 30 patients (83% female) were enrolled, mean age was 45±14 years and mean SLE disease duration was 10±8 years. 80% had low to moderate disease activity. All had a low SLE damage index. CMR was abnormal in 13/30 (43%), showing LGE in 9/13, stress perfusion deficits in 5/13 and pericardial effusion (PE) in 7/13. Patients with non-ischemic LGE had more often microalbuminuria while patients with stress perfusion deficits a history of hypertension, renal disorder as ACR criterion, repolarisation abnormalities on ECG and larger LV enddiastolic volume index. There was no correlation between clinical symptoms and CMR results. Conclusion Our study shows that cardiac involvement as observed by CMR is frequent in SLE and not necessarily associated with typical symptoms. CMR may thus help to detect subclinical cardiac involvement, which could lead to earlier treatment. Additionally we identify possible risk factors associated with cardiac involvement."

However, calcium deficiency is a very common nutritional problem in the world and especially in China. The aim of this research was to determine the dietary calcium intake of Chinese adults and the corresponding food sources based on data from the 2015 China Nutritional Transition Cohort Study. Methods We obtained dietary data from Chinese adults ages 18 to 64 years in 15 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities using 3 consecutive days combined with the household weighing method. We used the China Food Composition (book 1, 2nd edition) to calculate the calcium intake from each food category. We regarded the percentage of participants with a calcium intake median below the estimated average requirement as the level of calcium inadequacy in the overall population. Results We divided the participants into 2 age groups, 18–49 years and 50–64 years, which included 6,630 and 5,307 participants, respectively. The groups’ dietary calcium intake medians were 324.8 milligrams per day (mg/d) and 332.7 mg/d, respectively, and the calcium inadequacies were 92.9% and 96.0%, correspondingly. The median calcium intake for the whole study population was 328.3 mg/d, and the inadequacy was 94.3%, which improved with higher education, income, and urbanization levels. The main food sources of dietary calcium among the study population were vegetables, legumes, and cereals, which contributed 30.2%, 16.7%, and 14.6%, respectively. Milk and dairy products contributed 6.7% to the study population but varied with the urbanization level to 15.0%, 6.1%, 6.3%, and 2.0% in urban, suburban, county, and rural areas, respectively. Conclusion These findings highlight the importance of nutrition education and intervention for Chinese adults to improve their dietary structures and increase milk and dairy products intake to consume adequate calcium."

FXR belongs to the structurally conserved family of nuclear receptors that function as ligand-regulated transcription factors. It consists of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, which targets the receptor to specific genes, coupled by a flexible linker to a ligand-binding domain (LBD). The LBD can bind small lipophilic ligands and then serves as the transcriptional switch. Like most NRs, regulation of transcription by FXR is a complex process that relies on the release of corepressors and the ligand-dependent recruitment of coactivator proteins to a surface on the LBD. This surface, usually formed by helices 3, 4, 5, and 12 in FXR, is also called the activation function-2 (AF2) surface. In turn, those coregulatory proteins mediate the interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery, resulting in repression or activation of transcription (5Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L.

Generally, RXR heterodimers that contain PPAR, LXR, and FXR, which can be activated by ligands for either partner in the dimer, are permissive RXR heterodimers. Heterodimer RXR/RAR demonstrates conditional permissiveness, because full response to RXR ligands occurs only in the presence of an RAR agonist.

More structural information is needed to delineate the SCA network at the atomic level. To date, a number of FXR–LBD crystal structures have been resolved in complex with a range of distinct ligands, which show that FXR possesses a highly flexible ligand-binding pocket. However, these structures only contained FXR–LBD; thus, it remained unclear whether the presence of RXRα would impact FXR’s structure and function. Further understanding of FXR regulation requires a more in-depth knowledge of the interactions between FXR and its binding partner RXRα. Herein, we present crystal structures of FXR–LBD complexed with coactivator and two novel FXR ligands and, for the first time, FXR/RXRα–LBD heterodimer complexes in the presence of novel FXR ligands and natural RXR ligand. In addition, we conducted in vitro studies to determine the transcriptional coactivator steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1) binding affinities for the individual nuclear receptors and receptors in the heterodimer complex. Structure-guided mutagenesis experiments were further used to investigate the signaling between the heterodimers. The hFXR–LBD was crystallized in the presence of FXR agonists (HNC143 and HNC180) and SRC1 (fragment 741–761) with one LXXLL motif. The purified hFXR/RXRα–LBD heterodimer was crystallized in complex with FXR agonists (HNC143, HNC180, or GW4064), RXR natural ligand 9cRA, and a synthetic peptide derived from the coactivator SRC1–2 (fragment 685–700, the second LXXLL motif in SRC1) containing a single LXXLL motif. Purification of the coexpressed hFXR/RXRα–LBD heterodimer (see “Experimental procedures”) and addition of compounds and SRC1 peptide were critical for the complex crystallization. FXR–LBD/ligand structures were solved by the molecular-replacement method using previously determined FXR–LBD structure as the search probe. The heterodimer complex structures were also determined by molecular replacement method with the FXR and RXRα monomer structures as the searching models in two steps. Electron density maps showed clear features for the respective ligands in the structures, the LXXLL motifs of the SRC1 peptides, and each LBD, except for helix 2 in RXRα and some regions in FXR.

Both LBDs adopted the canonical three-layered α helical sandwich fold, with FXR containing 12 α-helices (H1 to H12) and RXR containing 10 α-helices and 2 β-strands. The FXR and RXRα ligands occupy their respective ligand-binding pockets, and both receptors adopt the active configuration, such that the H12 is folded against the main body of the LBD. This conformation generates a recognition surface (AF2 surface) constituted by mostly hydrophobic residues from H3, H4, and H12 of FXR and RXRα, which allow one SRC1 peptide to bind to each receptor. Two coactivator peptides fold as a two-turn α-helix in the heterodimer complex with the hydrophobic side chains (LXXLL) packed against the agonist-induced FXR and RXRα surfaces. HNC compounds (HNC143 and HNC180) are GW4064 analogues (Fig. 2, a–c), sharing the similar hydrophobic head that can bind in the same position in FXR ligand-binding pocket. Compared with GW4064 and HNC143, HNC180 has a more potent EC50 in a coactivator recruitment assay (Fig. 2h) and is much more active in cell transfection assays (Fig. 2i). Electron density maps allowed unambiguous placement of HNC143, HNC180, and GW4064 into the FXR ligand-binding pocket in the heterodimer structures (Fig. 2, d–f) and monomer structures (data not shown). Overall, these binding modes are similar to that adopted by GW4064 in the monomeric FXR–LBD (21Akwabi-Ameyaw A. Bass J.Y. Caldwell R.D. Caravella J.A. Chen L. Creech K.L. Deaton D.N. Jones S.A. Kaldor I. Liu Y. Madauss K.P. Marr H.B. McFadyen R.B. Miller A.B. Navas III, F. et al.Conformationally constrained farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists: naphthoic acid-based analogs of GW 4064.Bioorg.

The nonsteroid ring system of HNC143 or HNC180 is sandwiched between two hydrophobic layers of residues mainly contributed from H3, H5, and H11. The large number of hydrophobic interactions observed between HNC compounds and FXR suggests that these interactions are important for the binding. Structure superposition of HNC143 and HNC180 with GW4064 in the heterodimer structures (Fig. 2g) shows that the tail end of compound HNC143 rotated significantly. This positional difference also exits in the FXR–LBD monomer structures (data not shown). In both FXR–LBD monomer and heterodimer structures with these three ligands, the carboxylate of HNC143 forms a hydrogen bond with His344, leading to stabilization of the loop between H5 and H6, whereas HNC180 and GW4064 interact with Arg331 (Fig. S2). For HNC180 and GW4064-bound structures, the segment between H5 and H6 in FXR–LBD forms a short helix in the monomer structures, whereas it is absent in the heterodimer structure because of a lack of electron density. These results suggest that FXR has considerable conformation dynamics upon binding with different ligands or forming heterodimer with RXR. Given the importance of heterodimerization in nuclear receptor signal pathway, we addressed the question whether association of FXR and RXRα modifies the intrinsic ability of the receptors to interact with coregulators. To this end, we purified FXR–LBD and RXRα–LBD with or without fused LXXLL motifs (see “Experimental procedures”) to examine whether nuclear receptor LBD dimerization can influence the coactivator binding. The fused SRC1 to one of the two receptors in the heterodimer was designed to assess the binding of biotin-labeled SRC1 to the nonfused receptor in coactivator binding assay. To validate this approach, FXR/RXR heterodimer fused with two SRC1 peptides was tested in the fluorescence anisotropy assay. The results show that there is no binding between the two-SRC1–fused heterodimer and fluorescein-labeled peptide (Fig. S1). We then examined the SRC1 binding affinity for FXR and RXR in the context of the heterodimer and in response to different ligands (Table S1). The affinity of SRC1676–700 LXXLL motifs binding to the FXR–LBD alone (Kd = 6.60 μm) is lower than binding to the FXR–LBD in the FXR/RXR–LBD heterodimer complex (Kd = 2.42 μm) (Fig. 3, a and c). A similar effect was found in RXRα–LBD (Fig. 3, b and d). Therefore, dimerization enhances the binding affinity of FXR–LBD and RXR–LBD for LXXLL motifs. In addition, contributing to the overall stability of the receptor, FXR agonists or RXR agonist (9cRA) can enhance the SRC1 binding, and the addition of 9cRA or FXR agonists will further increase the binding affinity in FXR/RXR·SRC1 or FXR·SRC1/RXR heterodimer (Fig. 3, e and f). We further tested the EC50 of FXR ligands in coactivator recruitment assay in the context of FXR monomer or FXR/RXR heterodimer, with or without RXR agonist 9cRA (Table 2). The results show that heterodimerization with RXR will improve the EC50 of all these ligands. However, when 9cRA is added, differentiated effects of the FXR compounds were observed. Ligands HNC180 and GW4064 have better EC50 in FXR/RXR–LBD dimer; on the other hand, EC50 of HNC143, INT747, and ivermectin decrease to FXR monomer level or even lower. This result suggested that the higher-order nuclear receptor complex structure improves coactivator binding, and the synergistic effect between the two receptors ligands may have ligand selectivity.Table 2EC50 of ligands in the coactivator recruitment assay with monomeric or heterodimeric FXR–LBDReceptorEC50HNC143HNC180GW4064INT747IvermectinμmFXR–LBD0.228 ± 0.0150.043 ± 0.0020.131 ± 0.0330.521 ± 0.0270.468 ± 0.049FXR/RXR-LBD0.086 ± 0.0050.032 ± 0.0010.036 ± 0.0120.359 ± 0.0080.396 ± 0.036FXR/RXR–LBD·9cRA0.211 ± 0.0300.049 ± 0.0210.050 ± 0.0040.843 ± 0.1590.726 ± 0.035 Open table in a new tab Consistent with other RXR heterodimer structures, FXR and RXRα interact via the conserved asymmetric dimer interface, largely comprised of H11 in each monomer, with additional contacts from H7 and H9, loops L8–9 and L9–10. The interactions consist of an intricate network of hydrophobic and polar interactions (Table S2), with H11 of RXRα and FXR forming a coiled coil structure as shown in Fig. 4a. During the protein purification, we found that the isolated FXR–LBD is mostly monomeric, whereas mixing equivalent FXR and RXR LBDs yields essentially heterodimer (data not shown). Comparing the structurally available RXR heterodimers with RXR homodimer, RXR partners differ in the degree of bending and orientation of H11, even though they share similar electrostatic and polar contacts in the heterodimer interface. In the nonpermissive TR/RXR heterodimer, TRβ H11 has a marked shift, resulting in a rotation of H11 and H5 in RXRα and then disruption of the active conformation of RXRα (20Kojetin D.J. Matta-Camacho E. Hughes T.S. Srinivasan S. Nwachukwu J.C. Cavett V. Nowak J. Chalmers M.J. Marciano D.P. Kamenecka T.M. Shulman A.I. Rance M. Griffin P.R. Bruning J.B. Nettles K.W. Structural mechanism for signal transduction in RXR nuclear receptor heterodimers.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (26289479)801310.1038/ncomms9013Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although the backbone of the N terminus of H11 in the permissive RXR partners superimpose well with the RXR homodimer, noticeable shifts exist in the C terminus of H11 (Fig. 4b). The differences in the heterodimer interface (especially H11) between the permissive and nonpermissive RXR heterodimer suggest that receptor/ligand-specific bending of H11 also contributes to the cross-dimer signaling. Previous studies have shown that an electrostatic tethering across the dimer interface exists in most RXR heterodimers in the plane of ligand, suggesting a conduit for structural information from the ligand to the partner receptor (22Nettles K.W. Greene G.L. Ligand control of coregulator recruitment to nuclear receptors.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67 (15709961): 309-33310.1146/annurev.physiol.66.032802.154710Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In our FXR/RXR heterodimer structures, residue Glu434 in RXRα can form a hydrogen bond across the dimer interface with His445 in FXR (Fig. 5d). We then tested several RXR–LBD Glu434 mutations (E434N, E434Q, E434K, and E434A) with WT FXR–LBD in the coactivator binding assay, using RXRα agonist 9cRA and FXR agonist GW4064. The results showed that RXR mutants could affect the signal transduction between the heterodimer (Fig. 5a). When Glu434 in RXR was mutated to Ala, the FXR agonist could hardly increase the ability of RXR to recruit SRC1. Using FXR and RXR mutants, cell-based transfection assay demonstrated that both full-length FXR H445A and RXR E434A mutations decreased the synergistic effect of 9cRA and GW4064 (Fig. 5b). These results indicated that the interaction between the RXR Glu434 and FXR His445 in the heterodimer interface is essential for the synergistic effect. We then looked at whether His445 in FXR is conserved in other RXR partners. Structure-based sequence alignment showed that the presence of basic amino acid (His) at this particular position is unique for FXR. In other nuclear receptors, the residue that forms the electrostatic tethering with Glu434 in RXR corresponds to the position one turn following the His445 in H11 of FXR (Fig. S3). Using SCA, Ranganathan and co-workers (11Shulman A.I. Larson C. Mangelsdorf D.J. Ranganathan R. Structural determinants of allosteric ligand activation in RXR heterodimers.Cell. 2004; 116 (15016376): 417-42910.1016/S0092-8674(04)00119-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) identified a network of 27 coevolved amino acids that are energetically coupled and mediate allosteric signaling in the RXR heterodimers. The mutagenesis study showed that FXR E326A and the corresponding mutations in other permissive partners LXR, PPAR, and Nurr1 exhibit different transcriptional activity in RXR heterodimer. In our GW4064–FXR/9cRA–RXR structure, residue Glu326 in FXR forms salt bridges with and stabilizes Arg441 and Arg436, which participate in the formation of heterodimer interface (Fig. 5d). The E326A mutation would disrupt the interaction network and hinder the allosteric signal transduction from RXR, thereby decreasing the transcriptional activity of FXR. Furthermore, we generated other FXR mutations (R441A and R455S) that belong to the SCA network; each of them decreased the synergistic effect of the two receptor agonists in the cell transactivation assay (Fig. 5c). Taken together, these findings are directly in line with previous findings found in other RXR heterodimers: there are two patches of complementary clustered residues for signal transduction through H11 in FXR–RXR heterodimer. One is through the physically connected AF2 hydrophobic core of the receptor across the dimer interface in the SCA network. The other one connects the dimer interface via an electrostatic tethering across H11 at the plane of the ligands (Fig. S4). We then addressed the question of whether the dimerization interface could be altered depending on the type of bound ligands, thereby providing a structure basis for the allosteric communication between RXR heterodimers and diverse gene activation profiles (23Downes M.

In our three FXR–RXR heterodimer structures, all RXRα agonists are 9cRA (Fig. S5). Structure superposition of these complexes showed that the RXR parts superpose well (Fig. 6a), with root-mean-square deviations being 0.460 Å (GW4064–FXR/9cRA–RXR versus HNC143–FXR/9cRA–RXR) and 0.457 Å (HNC180–FXR/9cRA–RXR versus HNC143–FXR/9cRA–RXR) over RXRα Cα atoms. One significant difference is observed in the C terminus of H11 of RXR in HNC143–FXR/9cRA–RXR heterodimer, among which movement of residue"
https://openalex.org/W2895263174,"The feeding ecology of two reef fishes associated with artificial reefs in the northwest Gulf of Mexico (GoM) was examined using gut contents and natural stable isotopes. Reefs were divided into three regions (east, central, west) across an east to west gradient of increasing reef complexity and salinity. Gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus) primarily consumed reef-associated prey (xanthid crabs, bivalves, barnacles) and pelagic gastropods, while red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) diets were mainly comprised of non-reef prey (stomatopods, fishes, portunid crabs). Natural stable isotopes of carbon (δ13C), nitrogen (δ15N), and sulfur (δ34S) were measured in consumer muscle tissue as well as potential primary producers. Gray triggerfish occupied a lower trophic position than red snapper, with lower δ13C and δ15N values across all size classes and regions, and generally higher δ34S values. Red snapper had a smaller range of stable isotope values and corrected standard ellipse areas across all size classes and regions, indicating a smaller isotopic niche. Contribution estimates of particulate organic matter (26 to 54%) and benthic microalgae (BMA, 47 to 74%) for both species were similar, with BMA contributions greater across all three size classes (juveniles, sub-adults, adults) of red snapper and all but the juvenile size class for gray triggerfish. Species gut contents and stable isotopes differed by region, with fishes consuming more crabs in the east region and more gastropods in the central and west regions. δ13C and δ15N values generally decreased from east to west, while δ34S increased across this gradient. Results highlight species-specific feeding differences associated with artificial reefs, where gray triggerfish may be more dependent on the reef structure for foraging opportunities. In addition, results offer further information on the integral role of BMA in primary production at nearshore artificial reefs."

https://openalex.org/W2894567626,"Previous research has shown that fibroblast growth factor 2 protein (FGF2) can act as an anxiolytic and anti-depressive agent in rodents. Levels of hippocampal FGF2 and FGF2 receptors are decreased in post-mortem brains of individuals with mood disorders. No changes in FGF2 were noted in the post-mortem brains of individuals with mood disorders that were successfully treated with anti-depressant medication prior to death. Mutations in the FGF2 gene in humans have been shown to predict non-responsiveness to the therapeutic effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These findings suggest that FGF2 may potentially be a target of and/or required for the therapeutic effects of antidepressant medications. To test this, we employed a rodent model of depressive behaviour, chronic variable stress (CVS) in conjunction with antidepressant treatment (fluoxetine) in wild-type (WT) and FGF2 knockout mice (FGF2KO) and examined depressive and anxiety behaviors. Results showed that fluoxetine reversed the effects of CVS on depressive and anxiety behaviours in wild-type mice only, suggesting that the FGF2 gene is indeed necessary for the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine. Interestingly, CVS decreased hippocampal FGF2 levels and fluoxetine partially reversed this effect. Because FGF2 has been previously shown to modify HPA activity through hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors (GR), we examined levels of glucocorticoid receptors and found a decrease in GR in response to CVS, with a further decrease in FGF2KO. No effect of fluoxetine on GR was observed in either WT or FGF2KO mice. This suggests that further changes in glucocorticoid receptors are not necessary for the anti-depressant effects of fluoxetine in WT mice, although decreased glucocorticoid receptors in response to FGF2 deletion may preclude the therapeutic actions of fluoxetine in FGF2KO. Whether astroglia, astroglial functions, or HPA changes are the downstream target of FGF2-mediated changes induced by fluoxetine remains to be determined, however, the current study reaffirms the potential of FGF2 as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders."

Genetic ablation of Tbc1d1 or mutation of distinct phosphorylation sites impairs intracellular GLUT4 retention and GLUT4 traffic, presumably through alterations of the activation state of downstream Rab GTPases. Previous studies have focused on characterizing the C-terminal GAP domain of TBC1D1 that lacks the known phosphorylation sites, as well as putative regulatory domains. As a result, it has been unclear how phosphorylation of TBC1D1 would regulate its activity. In the present study, we have expressed, purified, and characterized recombinant full-length TBC1D1 in Sf9 insect cells via the baculovirus system. Full-length TBC1D1 showed RabGAP activity toward GLUT4-associated Rab8a, Rab10, and Rab14, indicating similar substrate specificity as the truncated GAP domain. However, the catalytic activity of the full-length TBC1D1 was markedly higher than that of the GAP domain. Although in vitro phosphorylation of TBC1D1 by AKT or AMPK increased 14-3-3 binding, it did not alter the intrinsic RabGAP activity. However, we found that TBC1D1 interacts through its N-terminal PTB domains with the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase, a resident protein of GLUT4 storage vesicles, and this binding is disrupted by phosphorylation of TBC1D1 by AKT or AMPK. In summary, our findings suggest that other regions outside the GAP domain may contribute to the catalytic activity of TBC1D1.

Moreover, as these studies focused on the GAP domains expressed in Escherichia coli, which were lacking the known phosphorylation sites, as well as all other putative regulatory domains, it has been not possible to study how phosphorylation would regulate the GAP activity of the enzyme. In fact, several studies have provided evidence that TBC1D4 might be regulated through phosphorylation of the PTB domains and alterations in protein-protein interactions (24Koumanov F.

The construct included an N-terminal His6 tag, two N-terminal PTB domains, a CBD, and the C-terminal GTPase-activating (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16- or GAP)-domain (Fig. 1A). We generated a mutant, TBC1D1-R854K, that lacks the arginine finger required for full catalytic activity (11Pan X. Eathiraj S. Munson M. Lambright D.G.

Baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were cultured, harvested, and the recombinant proteins were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using Ni-NTA resin as described under “Experimental procedures.” Typically, the purity of the protein was ∼35% as determined by densitometry of Coomassie-stained gels, and the yield after IMAC was approximately 0.1 to 0.3 mg/108 Sf9 cells. The purified protein showed an apparent molecular mass of ∼180 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). However, using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), the apparent molecular mass of the purified protein corresponded to ∼600 kDa (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, a minor proportion (∼5%) of the protein eluted in an SEC fraction corresponding to ∼180 kDa (Fig. 1C, inset). In our study, we used affinity-purified full-length TBC1D1 that contained both, the high Mr and the low Mr forms. To further characterize the enzyme, we investigated the GAP activity of TBC1D1 toward Rab10, an apparent natural substrate for the enzyme (9Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Mîinea C.P. Lienhard G.E. Substrate specificity and effect on GLUT4 translocation of the Rab GTPase-activating protein Tbc1d1.Biochem. J. 2007; 403 (17274760): 353-35810.1042/BJ20061798Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As the production of GST-Rab10 in E. coli had low yield, we also generated a baculovirus to express and purify sufficient amounts of GST-tagged mouse Rab10 in Sf9 cells. Purified GST-Rab10 was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP and then incubated either alone, or with full-length TBC1D1, or the GAP mutant (R854K) of TBC1D1 as described under “Experimental procedures.” To determine the GTPase activity, we measured the rate of production of [32P]phosphate from the hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP to GDP. As shown in Fig. 2A, purified GST-Rab10 exhibited some endogenous GTPase activity. GTP hydrolysis of GST-Rab10 was substantially increased by TBC1D1, but much less by the R854K mutant. We then compared the relative activities of the truncated GST-GAP domain and the full-length TBC1D1 toward Rab10. The GAPs were incubated with increasing concentrations of [γ-32P]GTP-loaded GST-Rab10 and the amount of released [32P]phosphate was determined. Compared with the truncated GAP domain, the full-length protein displayed markedly higher activity toward Rab10 as substrate (Fig. 2B). Using nonlinear fitting to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, we estimated a moderate decrease in apparent Km (30.4 μm) of the full-length TBC1D1 compared with the GST-tagged GAP domain (60.5 μm) for GST-Rab10 as substrate, and a ∼10-fold increase in apparent Vmax for the full-length TBC1D1 (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1). We and others have shown previously that both Rab8a and Rab14 are substrates for the truncated GAP domain of TBC1D1 in vitro (9Roach W.G. Chavez J.A. Mîinea C.P. Lienhard G.E.

We therefore compared the GAP activities toward the different GTP-loaded Rabs.

However, only a small subpopulation of these structures is infectious. One of the major unresolved questions in prion research is identifying which specific structural features of these misfolded protein aggregates are important for prion infectivity in vivo. Previously, two types of proteinase K–resistant, self-propagating aggregates were generated from the recombinant mouse prion protein in the presence of identical cofactors. Although these two aggregates appear biochemically very similar, they have dramatically different biological properties, with one of them being highly infectious and the other one lacking any infectivity. Here, we used several MS-based structural methods, including hydrogen–deuterium exchange and hydroxyl radical footprinting, to gain insight into the nature of structural differences between these two PrP aggregate types. Our experiments revealed a number of specific differences in the structure of infectious and noninfectious aggregates, both at the level of the polypeptide backbone and quaternary packing arrangement. In particular, we observed that a high degree of order and stability of β-sheet structure within the entire region between residues ∼89 and 227 is a primary attribute of infectious PrP aggregates examined in this study. By contrast, noninfectious PrP aggregates are characterized by markedly less ordered structure up to residue ∼167. The structural constraints reported here should facilitate development of experimentally based high-resolution structural models of infectiosus mammalian prions.

https://openalex.org/W2894986091,"Schistosomiasis is a widespread parasitic infection that affects humans, as well as wild and domestic animals. It ranks second after malaria, with a significant health and socio-economic impact in the developing countries. The objective of this study was to assess the anti-schistosomal impact of Ziziphus spina-christi leaf extract (ZLE) on Schistosoma mansoni-induced liver fibrosis in CD-1 Swiss male albino mice. S. mansoni infection was achieved by dipping of mouse tails in schistosomal cercariae. ZLE treatment was initiated at 46 days post-infection by administering a dose of the extract on a daily basis for 10 consecutive days. S. mansoni infection resulted in liver granuloma and fibrosis, with a drastic elevation in liver function factors, nitric oxide, and lipid peroxidation, which were associated with a reduction in glutathione content and substantial inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activities compared to those of the control. Induction of hepatic granuloma, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in the liver was controlled by ZLE administration, which also produced inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9, alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor-β, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases expressions. In addition, the S. mansoni-infected group exhibited an increase in Bax and caspase-3 levels and a decrease in Bcl-2 level. However, treatment with ZLE mainly mitigated apoptosis in the liver. Thus, the findings of this study revealed that Ziziphus spina-christi had anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, antioxidant, and protective effects on S. mansoni-induced liver wounds. The benefits of Ziziphus spina-christi extract on S. mansoni were partly partially mediated by enhancing anti-fibrinogenic and nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2895175199,"Over two-thirds of adults in the United States are obese or overweight, which is largely due to chronic overconsumption of diets high in fats and sugars (i.e., Western diet). Recent studies reveal that maternal obesity may predispose offspring to development of obesity and other metabolic diseases; however, the molecular underpinnings of these outcomes are largely unknown. The endocannabinoid system is an important signaling pathway that controls feeding behavior and energy homeostasis, and its activity becomes upregulated in the upper small intestinal epithelium of Western diet-induced obese mice, which drives overeating. In the current investigation, we examined the impact of chronic maternal consumption of Western diet on the expression and function of the endocannabinoid system in several peripheral organs important for food intake and energy homeostasis in offspring. Female C57BL/6Tac mice were fed a Western diet or low-fat/no-sucrose control chow for 10 weeks, then males were introduced for mating. Dams were maintained on their respective diets through weaning of pups, at which time pups were maintained on low-fat/no-sucrose chow for 10 weeks. Neonates born from dams fed Western diet, when compared to those born from mice fed control chow, unexpectedly displayed increases in mortality that occurred exclusively within six days following birth (greater than 50% mortality). Males comprised a larger fraction of surviving offspring from obese dams. Furthermore, surviving offspring displayed transient increases in body mass for first two days post weaning, and no marked changes in feeding patterns and endocannabinoid levels in upper small intestinal epithelium, pancreas, and plasma, or in expression of key endocannabinoid system genes in the upper small intestinal epithelium and pancreas at 10 weeks post-weaning. Collectively, these results suggest that maternal diet composition greatly influences survival of neonate C57BL/6Tac mice, and that surviving offspring from dams chronically fed a Western diet do not display marked changes in body mass, eating patterns, or expression and function of the endocannabinoid system in several peripheral organs important for feeding behavior and energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2894773478,"Iron deficiency is closely associated with altered GABA metabolism and affective behavior. While mutation in the hemochromatosis ( HFE) gene disrupts iron homeostasis and promotes oxidative stress that increases the risk of neurodegeneration, it is largely unknown whether HFE mutation modifies GABAergic homeostasis and emotional behavior. The goal of our study was to investigate the impact of HFE on GABAergic neurochemistry and redox-epigenetic regulation in the brain using H67D HFE-mutant mice that recapitulates the H63D-HFE mutation in humans. H67D mice displayed elevated redox-active iron levels in the brain by 32% compared to age-matched wild-type mice. Moreover, the H67D brain had increased isoprostane and decreased glutathione, indicating elevated oxidative stress. Additionally, the H67D brain had decreased global methylation and attenuated DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity. Direct addition of iron to purified DNMT in vitro decreased enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Last, H67D mice exhibited decreased anxiety-like behavior, which was associated with increased expression of the GABAA receptor α2 subunits by 93%, and these changes were also observed in H67D mice fed a low-iron diet. Taken together, our results suggest a putative role of HFE in regulating labile iron status in the brain, and mutation in H67D perturbs redox-methylation status, contributing to GABAergic dysfunction.-Ye, Q., Trivedi, M., Zhang, Y., Böhlke, M., Alsulimani, H., Chang, J., Maher, T., Deth, R., Kim, J.

The variation may cause by different subjects or different course design. Moreover, those studies did not explain how the association among different domains of learning objective was in FCs. The purpose of this study was to explore the help of learning domains from a FC of suturing skill in year-5 medical students.This study determined sample size according to statistical power. A minimum number of 77 participants for regression analysis are needed. Therefore, this study enrolled 78 medical students in a 2-hour suturing course, which consisted of pre-class video and in-class instruction. Both simple and mattress suturing were taught. The students received an anonymous survey with questionnaire of Help from Instruction Questionnaire for Clinical Skills (HIQ-CS) after the course. The HIQ-CS was developed by medical education team according to Bloom's taxonomy, and its reliability was favorable (Cronbach's ^l = 0.839). Factor loadings among all items in the HIQ-CS was also favorable (0.790 to 0.849). This study determined consensus of students' perspective by median (Me) and interquartile range (IQR), and tested mediation among different learning domains by regression.The results showed medical students agreed FC can help them in learning suturing (Me = 4, IQR = 1). The cognitive help (β = .526, p < .001) was completely mediated by psychomotor help (β = .399, p < .001) and affective help (β = .413, p < .001) to overall helps in FC. The affective help (β = .617, p < .001) was partially mediated by psychomotor help to overall helps in FC.FC may help students in learning suturing skill in different domains. Our model explains the cognitive help from FC provides an important foundation for the helps of other domains. Although the model should be examined by different curricula and measurements in future, the model of help from instruction in our study provided an innovated concept and framework in medical education."

These enzymes rapidly hydrolyze cefotaxime, but not the related cephalosporin, ceftazidime. ESBL variants have evolved, however, that provide enhanced ceftazidime resistance. We show here that a natural variant at a nonactive site, i.e. second-shell residue N106S, enhances enzyme stability but reduces catalytic efficiency for cefotaxime and ceftazidime and decreases resistance levels. However, when the N106S variant was combined with an active-site variant, D240G, that enhances enzyme catalytic efficiency, but decreases stability, the resultant double mutant exhibited higher resistance levels than predicted on the basis of the phenotypes of each variant. We found that this epistasis is due to compensatory effects, whereby increased stability provided by N106S overrides its cost of decreased catalytic activity. X-ray structures of the variant enzymes in complex with cefotaxime revealed conformational changes in the active-site loop spanning residues 103–106 that were caused by the N106S substitution and relieve steric strain to stabilize the enzyme, but also alter contacts with cefotaxime and thereby reduce catalytic activity. We noted that the 103–106 loop conformation in the N106S-containing variants is different from that of WT CTX-M but nearly identical to that of the non-ESBL, TEM-1 β-lactamase, having a serine at the 106 position. Therefore, residue 106 may serve as a “switch” that toggles the conformations of the 103–106 loop.

The aim of this study was to determine indicators for cancer residue (CR) status in cases of non-curative ESD. We analyzed 47 cases of non-curative ESD followed by salvage surgery and collected data regarding the rates of CR, which included both local CR and lymph node metastasis (LNM). To elucidate the risk factors for CR status, we compared the CR positive and the CR negative groups among surgical specimens according to the following variables obtained from ESD findings: tumor location, tumor size, depth of invasion, lympho-vascular invasion, histological margin, and histological diagnosis. The eCura system, which is an LNM risk scoring system, was also applied and scores were calculated in each case as follows: 3 points for lymphatic invasion and 1 point each for tumor size >30 mm, positive vertical margin, venous invasion, and submucosal invasion ≥500 μm. There were 9 (19%) CR positive cases, which included 6 cases of local CR and 4 cases of LNM; no cancer was detected in over 80% of the patients. The eCura scoring system was the only significant factor for CR status: the higher the eCura score, the greater the CR positivity (p = 0.0128). In particular, all patients in the low-risk group (score = 0–1 point) had no CR. Although no cancer recurrence was observed during a median follow-up of 4 years, 2 patients died of pneumonia. In conclusion, the eCura system might make it possible to select appropriate cases for salvage surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2894680188,"Calorie restriction (CR) exerts remarkable, beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis by mechanisms that are not fully understood. Given the relevance of white adipose tissue (WAT) in glucose homeostasis, we aimed at identifying the main cellular processes regulated in WAT in response to CR in a pathologic context of obesity. For this, a gene-expression profiling study was first conducted in mice fed ad libitum or subjected to 40% CR. We found that the gene network related to mitochondria was the most highly upregulated in WAT by CR. To study the role that increased mitochondrial biogenesis plays on glucose homeostasis following CR, we generated a mouse model devoid of the coactivators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ³ coactivator 1 (PGC-1)α and PGC-1β specifically in adipocytes. Our results show that mice lacking PGC-1s in adipocytes are unable to increase mitochondrial biogenesis in WAT upon CR. Despite a blunted induction of mitochondrial biogenesis in response to calorie deprivation, mice lacking adipose PGC-1s still respond to CR by improving their glucose homeostasis. Our study demonstrates that PGC-1 coactivators are major regulators of CR-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in WAT and that increased mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function in adipose tissue are not required for the improvement of glucose homeostasis mediated by CR.—Pardo, R., Vila, M., Cervela, L., de Marco, M., Gama-Pérez, P., González-Franquesa, A., Statuto, L., Vilallonga, R., Simó, R., Garcia-Roves, P.

A previous study showed that vaccination of pre-smolt salmon with a plasmid encoding the structural polypeptide of SAV gave protection against infection and development of PD accompanied by production of antibodies against the virus. In the present work we analyzed transcript responses in the muscle to vaccination with this plasmid (here named pSAV). The purpose was to shed light on how pSAV might initiate adaptive immune responses in the fish. The work was based on microarray and reverse transcription quantitative PCR analyses of muscle at the injection site 7 days after vaccination. The results showed that pSAV and pcDNA3.3 had similar abilities to up-regulate type I IFN stimulated genes. In contrast, pSAV caused higher up-regulation of IFNγ and several IFNγ inducible genes. Compared to pcDNA3.3, pSAV also gave larger increase in transcripts of marker genes for B-cells, T-cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs), which suggest attraction and role of these cells in the adaptive immune responses elicited by pSAV. Moreover, pSAV caused a stronger up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL10 and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1ß and TNFα, which may explain attraction of lymphocytes and APCs. The present work shows that the expression profile of genes resulting from vaccination with pSAV is different from the expression profiles obtained previously by vaccination of salmonids with DNA vaccines against infectious salmon anemia virus and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus."

Here, we show that a C. difficile strain of S-layer cassette type 11, Ox247, has a complex glycan attached via an O-linkage to Thr-38 of the S-layer low-molecular-weight subunit. Using MS and NMR, we fully characterized this glycan. We present evidence that it is composed of three domains: (i) a core peptide–linked tetrasaccharide with the sequence -4-α-Rha-3-α-Rha-3-α-Rha-3-β-Gal-peptide; (ii) a repeating pentasaccharide with the sequence -4-β-Rha-4-α-Glc-3-β-Rha-4-(α-Rib-3-)β-Rha-; and (iii) a nonreducing end–terminal 2,3 cyclophosphoryl-rhamnose attached to a ribose-branched sub-terminal rhamnose residue. The Ox247 genome contains a 24-kb locus containing genes for synthesis and protein attachment of this glycan. Mutations in genes within this locus altered or completely abrogated formation of this glycan, and their phenotypes suggested that this S-layer modification may affect sporulation, cell length, and biofilm formation of C. difficile. In summary, our findings indicate that the S-layer protein of SLCT-11 strains displays a complex glycan and suggest that this glycan is required for C. difficile sporulation and control of cell shape, a discovery with implications for the development of antimicrobials targeting the S-layer.

Experiments were performed on genetically altered mice and/or on vessels from these mice or humans. Here we show that deletion of the thromboxane-prostanoid receptor (TP−/−) abolished or drastically diminished the contraction to PGF2α in isolated mouse vessels (some of which were resistance arteries) and reduced the elevation in blood pressure evoked by the prostanoid under in vivo conditions. In accordance, TP antagonism abolished the contraction in small arteries of human omentum. Further deletion of E prostanoid receptor type 3 (EP3−/−) removed the PGF2α-evoked contraction that remained in some TP−/− arteries and added to the effect of TP−/− on the elevation in blood pressure evoked by the prostanoid under in vivo conditions. In contrast, the uterine contraction to PGF2α mediated via the F prostanoid receptor (FP) was unaltered in TP−/−/EP3−/− mice.

https://openalex.org/W2895775585,"Aims Endothelial activation is involved in many chronic inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis, and is often initiated by cytokines. Oncostatin M (OSM) is a relatively unknown cytokine that has been suggested to play a role in both endothelial activation and atherosclerosis. We comprehensively investigated the effect of OSM on endothelial cell activation from different vascular beds and in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice. Methods and results Human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human aortic endothelial cells and human microvascular endothelial cells cultured in the presence of OSM express elevated MCP-1, IL-6 and ICAM-1 mRNA levels. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human aortic endothelial cells additionally expressed increased VCAM-1 and E-selectin mRNA levels. Moreover, ICAM-1 membrane expression is increased as well as MCP-1, IL-6 and E-selectin protein release. A marked increase was observed in STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation indicating that the JAK/STAT pathway is involved in OSM signaling. OSM signals through the LIF receptor alfa (LIFR) and the OSM receptor (OSMR). siRNA knockdown of the LIFR and the OSMR revealed that simultaneous knockdown is necessary to significantly reduce MCP-1 and IL-6 secretion, VCAM-1 and E-selectin shedding and STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation after OSM stimulation. Moreover, OSM administration to APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice enhances plasma E-selectin levels and increases ICAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesion in the aortic root area. Furthermore, Il-6 mRNA expression was elevated in the aorta of OSM treated mice. Conclusion OSM induces endothelial activation in vitro in endothelial cells from different vascular beds through activation of the JAK/STAT cascade and in vivo in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice. Since endothelial activation is an initial step in atherosclerosis development, OSM may play a role in the initiation of atherosclerotic lesion formation."
https://openalex.org/W2893740973,"Objectives To evaluate the perceptions of the general public and healthcare practitioners (HCP) in Canada about the relationship between running and knee joint health, and to explore HCP`s usual recommendations to runners with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Methods Non-runners and runners (with and without KOA) and HCP completed an online survey regarding the safety of running for knee joint health. HCP also provided information related to usual clinical recommendations. Proportions of agreement were compared between non-runners and runners. Results A total of 114 non-runners, 388 runners and 329 HCP completed the survey. Overall, running was perceived as detrimental for the knee joint by 13.1% of the general public, while 25.9% were uncertain. More uncertainty was reported regarding frequent (33.9%) and long-distance (43.6%) running. Statistical analyses revealed greater proportions of non-runners perceiving running negatively compared with runners. Overall, 48.4% believed that running in the presence of KOA would lead to disease progression, while 53.1% believed running would lead to premature arthroplasty. In HCP, 8.2%, 9.1% and 22.2% perceived that running in general, running frequently, or running long-distances are risk factors for KOA, respectively. 37.1% and 2.7% of HCP typically recommended patients with KOA to modify their running training or to quit running, respectively. Conclusion High rates of uncertainty among the general public and HCP in Canada outline the need for further studies about running and knee joint health. Filling knowledge gaps will help inform knowledge translation strategies to better orientate the general public and HCP about the safety of running for knee joint health."

https://openalex.org/W2894853909,"Paratuberculosis, also known as Johne's disease (JD), is a chronic contagious disease, caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). The disease is incurable, fatal and causes economic losses estimated to exceed 200 million dollars to the U.S. dairy industry annually. Several preventive and control measures have been recommended; however, only a few of these measures have been validated empirically. Using a nested compartmental (NC) modeling approach, the main objective of this research was to identify the best combination of control and preventive measures that minimizes the prevalence and incidence of JD and the risk of MAP occurrence in a dairy herd. The NC model employs both MAP transmission estimates and data on pen movement of cattle on a dairy to quantify the effectiveness of control and preventive measures. To obtain reasonable ranges of parameter values for between-pen movements, the NC model was fitted to the movement data of four typical California dairy farms. Using the estimated ranges of the movement parameters and those of JD from previous research, the basic reproduction number was calculated to measure the risk of MAP occurrence in each pen environment as well as the entire dairy. Although the interventions evaluated by the NC model were shown to reduce the infection, no single measure alone was capable of eradicating the infection. The numerical simulations suggest that a combination of test and cull with more frequent manure removal is the most effective method in reducing incidence, prevalence and the risk of MAP occurrence. Other control measures such as limiting calf-adult cow contacts, raising calves in a disease-free herd or colostrum management were less effective."
https://openalex.org/W2895692720,"Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes (MDDS) are a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of human diseases caused by mutations in nuclear genes and characterized by a severe reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number leading to impaired energy production in affected tissues and organs. Mutations in the MPV17 gene, whose role is still elusive, were described as cause of the hepatocerebral form of MDDS and Navajo neuro-hepathopathy. The high degree of conservation observed between MPV17 and its yeast homolog SYM1 made the latter a good model for the study of the pathology. Here, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae to elucidate the molecular consequences of seven MPV17 missense mutations identified in patients and localized in different protein domains. The phenotypic analysis of the appropriate sym1 mutant strains created demonstrated deleterious effect for all mutations regarding OXPHOS metabolism and mtDNA stability. We deepened the pathogenic effect of the mutations by investigating whether they prevented the correct protein localization into the mitochondria or affected the stability of the proteins. All the Sym1 mutant proteins correctly localized into the mitochondria and only one mutation predominantly affects protein stability. All the other mutations compromised the formation of the high molecular weight complex of unknown composition, previously identified both in yeast, cell cultures and mouse tissues, as demonstrated by the consistent fraction of the Sym1 mutant proteins found free or in not fully assembled complex, strengthening its role as protein forming part of a high molecular weight complex."
https://openalex.org/W2895424714,"The neurobiology of sexual preference is often discussed in terms of cerebral sex dimorphism. Yet, our knowledge about possible cerebral differences between homosexual men (HoM), heterosexual men (HeM) and heterosexual women (HeW) are extremely limited. In the present MRI study, we addressed this issue investigating measures of cerebral anatomy and function, which were previously reported to show sex difference. Specifically, we asked whether there were any signs of sex atypical cerebral dimorphism among HoM, if these were widely distributed (providing substrate for more general ‘female’ behavioral characteristics among HoM), or restricted to networks involved in self-referential sexual arousal. Cortical thickness (Cth), surface area (SA), subcortical structural volumes, and resting state functional connectivity were compared between 30 (HoM), 35 (HeM) and 38 (HeW). HoM displayed a significantly thicker anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), precuneus, and the left occipito-temporal cortex compared to both control groups. These differences seemed coordinated, since HoM also displayed stronger cortico-cortical covariations between these regions. Furthermore, functional connections within the default mode network, which mediates self- referential processing, and includes the ACC and precuneus were significantly weaker in HoM than HeM and HeW, whereas their functional connectivity between the thalamus and hypothalamus (important nodes for sexual behavior) was stronger. In addition to these singular features, HoM displayed ‘female’ characteristics, with a similar Cth in the left superior parietal and cuneus cortices as HeW, but different from HeM. These data suggest both singular and sex atypical features and motivate further investigations of cerebral midline structures in relation to male homosexuality."
https://openalex.org/W2895191543,"Objective Area of muscle, fat, and bone is often measured in thigh CT scans when tissue composition is a key outcome. SliceOmatic software is commonly referenced for such analysis but published methods may be insufficient for new users. Thus, a quick start guide to calculating thigh composition using SliceOmatic has been developed. Methods CT images of the thigh were collected from older (69 ± 4 yrs, N = 24) adults before and after 12-weeks of resistance training. SliceOmatic was used to segment images into seven density regions encompassing fat, muscle, and bone from -190 to +2000 Hounsfield Units [HU]. The relative contributions to thigh area and the effects of tissue density overlap for skin and marrow with muscle and fat were determined. Results The largest contributors to the thigh were normal fat (-190 to -30 HU, 29.1 ± 7.4%) and muscle (35 to 100 HU, 48.9 ± 8.2%) while the smallest were high density (101 to 150 HU, 0.79 ± 0.50%) and very high density muscle (151 to 200 HU, 0.07 ± 0.02%). Training significantly (P<0.05) increased area for muscle in the very low (-29 to -1 HU, 5.5 ± 7.9%), low (0 to 34 HU, 9.6 ± 16.8%), normal (35 to 100 HU, 4.2 ± 7.9%), and high (100 to 150 HU, 70.9 ± 80.6%) density ranges for muscle. Normal fat, very high density muscle and bone did not change (P>0.05). Contributions to area were altered by ~1% or less and the results of training were not affected by accounting for skin and marrow. Conclusions When using SliceOmatic to calculate thigh composition, accounting for skin and marrow may not be necessary. We recommend defining muscle as -29 to +200 HU but that smaller ranges (e.g. low density muscle, 0 to 34 HU) can easily be examined for relationships with the health condition and intervention of interest.

https://openalex.org/W2895657240,"Post-transcriptional regulatory elements associated with transcript degradation or transcript instability have been described at the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of the HLA-G gene. Considering that HPV infection and aneuploidy, which causes gene instability, are associated with cervical cell malignancy, as well as the fact that HIV infection and HLA-G may modulate the immune response, the present study aimed to compare the frequencies of HLA-G 3′UTR polymorphic sites (14-base pair insertion/deletion, +3142C/G, and +3187A/G) between 226 HIV+ women co-infected (n = 82) or not with HPV (n = 144) and 138 healthy women. We also evaluated the relationship between those HLA-G 3’UTR variants and aneuploidy in cervical cells. HPV types and HLA-G polymorphisms were determined by PCR and sequencing of cervical samples DNA. Aneuploidy in cervical cell was measured by flow cytometry. The HLA-G 3’UTR 14-bp ins/del was not associated with either HIV nor HIV/HPV co-infection. The +3142G allele (p = 0.049) and +3142GG genotype (p = 0.047) were overrepresented in all HIV-infected women. On the other hand, the +3187G allele (p = 0.028) and the +3187GG genotype (p = 0.026) predominated among healthy women. The +3142G (p = 0.023) and +3187A (p = 0.003) alleles were associated with predisposition to HIV infection, irrespective of the presence or not of HIV/HPV co-infection. The diplotype formed by the combination of the +3142CX (CC or CG) and +3187AA genotype conferred the highest risk for aneuploidy in cervical cell induced by HPV. The HLA-G 3’UTR +3142 and +3187 variants conferred distinct susceptibility to HIV infection and aneuploidy."

They are also emerging as an important source of novel bioactive secondary metabolites in pharmacological (as anticancer drugs) and biotechnological applications. In the present work we isolated a cyanobacteria in a free-living state from leaves of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica leaves. This newly collected strain was then cultivated under two laboratory conditions, and then characterized by combining morphological observation and molecular studies based on 16S rRNA gene sequences analysis. The strain showed 99% pairwise sequence identity with Halomicronema metazoicum ITAC101, never isolated before as a free-living organisms, but firstly described as an endosymbiont of the Mediterranean marine spongae Petrosia ficiformis, under the form of a filamentous strain. Further studies will investigate the actual role of this cyanobacterium in the leaf stratum of P. oceanica leaves, given its demonstrated ability to influence the vitality and the life cycle of other organisms. In fact, its newly demonstrated free-living stage, described in this study, indicate that Phormidium-like cyanobacteria could play important roles in the ecology of benthic and planktonic communities."
https://openalex.org/W2895451077,"Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins promote intracellular vesicle fusion by binding to N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs). A key SNARE-binding mode of SM proteins involves the N-terminal peptide (N-peptide) motif of syntaxin, a SNARE subunit localized to the target membrane. In in vitro membrane fusion assays, inhibition of N-peptide motif binding previously has been shown to abrogate the stimulatory function of Munc18-1, a SM protein involved in synaptic exocytosis in neurons. The physiological role of the N-peptide-binding mode, however, remains unclear. In this work, we addressed this key question using a Munc18-1 protein, in which an ectopic copy of the syntaxin N-peptide motif was directly fused to Munc18-1. We found that the ectopic N-peptide motif blocks the N-peptide-binding pocket of Munc18-1, preventing the latter from binding to the native N-peptide motif on syntaxin-1. In a reconstituted system, we observed that clogged Munc18-1 is defective in promoting SNARE zippering. When introduced into induced neuronal cells (iN cells) derived from human pluripotent stem cells, clogged Munc18-1 failed to mediate synaptic exocytosis. As a result, both spontaneous and evoked synaptic transmission was abolished. These genetic findings provide direct evidence for the crucial role of the N-peptide-binding mode of Munc18-1 in synaptic exocytosis. We suggest that clogged SM proteins will also be instrumental in defining the physiological roles of the N-peptide-binding mode in other vesicle-fusion pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2894617380,"The theory that glaucoma patients have a lower intracranial pressure (ICP) than healthy subjects is a controversial one. The aim of this study was to assess ICP noninvasively by determining the relationship between distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) phase and body position and to compare this relationship between patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG), and controls. The relationship was also calibrated using published data regarding invasive measurements of ICP versus body position. DPOAEs were measured in 30 controls and 32 glaucoma patients (17 POAG, 15 NTG) at the following body positions (assuming 90° as upright): 45, 30, 20, 10, 0 (supine), -10, and -20°. DPOAE phase had a clear, nonlinear relationship with body position. The mean DPOAE phase shifts between the two most extreme body positions (45 to -20°) were 73.6, 80.7, and 66.3° for healthy, POAG, and NTG, respectively (P = 0.73), and the groups showed the same, nonlinear behaviour. This indicates that there is no evidence that glaucoma patients have a reduced ICP. When calibrated with invasive data, ICP and DPOAE phase were linearly related over an ICP of 3 mmHg. This suggests that, more broadly, DPOAEs could be used in the future to monitor changes in ICP in a clinical setting and to measure dynamic changes in ICP such as diurnal fluctuations or changes induced by certain medications."
https://openalex.org/W2894463984,"McPherson’s Blau space and affiliation ecology model is a powerful tool for analyzing the ecological competition among social entities, such as organizations, along a combination of sociodemographic characteristics of their members. In this paper we introduce the R-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) package Blaunet, an integrated set of tools to calculate, visualize, and analyze the statuses of individuals and social entities in Blau space, parameterized by multiple sociodemographic traits as dimensions. The package is able to calculate the Blau statuses at the nodal, dyadic, and meso levels based on three types of information: sociodemographic characteristics, group affiliations (e.g., membership in groups/organizations), and network ties. To facilitate this, Blaunet has the following five main capabilities, it can: 1) identify a list of possible salient dimensions; 2) calculate, plot, and analyze niches for social entities by measuring the social distance along the salient dimensions between individuals affiliated with them; 3) generate Blau bubbles for individuals, thereby allowing the study of interpersonal influence of similar others even with limited or no network information; 4) capture niche dynamics cross-sectionally by calculating the intensity of exploitation from the carrying capacity and the membership rate; and 5) analyze the niche movement longitudinally by estimating the predicted niche movement equations. We illustrate these capabilities of Blaunet with example datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2894735396,"As an abundant post-translational modification, reversible phosphorylation is critical for the dynamic regulation of various biological processes. prkC, a critical serine/threonine-protein kinase in bacteria, plays important roles in regulation of signaling transduction. Identification of prkC-specific phosphorylation sites is fundamental for understanding the molecular mechanism of phosphorylation-mediated signaling. However, experimental identification of substrates for prkC is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and computational methods for kinase-specific phosphorylation prediction in bacteria have yet to be developed. In this study, we manually curated the experimentally identified substrates and phosphorylation sites of prkC from the published literature. The analyses of the sequence preferences showed that the substrate recognition pattern for prkC might be miscellaneous, and a complex strategy should be employed to predict potential prkC-specific phosphorylation sites. To develop the predictor, the amino acid location feature extraction method and the support vector machine algorithm were employed, and the methods achieved promising performance. Through 10-fold cross validation, the predictor reached a sensitivity of 91.67% at the specificity of 95.12%. Then, we developed freely accessible software, which is provided at http://free.cancerbio.info/prkc/. Based on the predictor, hundreds of potential prkC-specific phosphorylation sites were annotated based on the known bacterial phosphorylation sites. prkC-PSP was the first predictor for prkC-specific phosphorylation sites, and its prediction performance was promising. We anticipated that these analyses and the predictor could be helpful for further studies of prkC-mediated phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2895376877,"Although it is known that individuals living with HIV have a higher HPV prevalence, the impact of individual HPV types on HIV acquisition is less clear. In this prospective cohort study we investigated the relationship between HPV types and incident HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TW) in Lima, Peru. Six hundred HIV-negative Peruvian MSM and TW participated in a 2-year study with biannual visits. At baseline, participants completed a computerized, self-administered questionnaire on sexual behavior and HPV knowledge and underwent a physical exam including anogenital swabs for HPV DNA (37 genotypes via linear array testing) and HIV testing; follow-up visits included the questionnaire and HIV testing. Participant mean age was 25 years (range = 18–40), with 48.9% self-identifying as gay and 86.5% reporting having sex exclusively with men. At baseline, 530 participants had HPV DNA present (61.1% with high-risk HPV, 84.9% with low-risk HPV). Among 571 participants who returned for any study visit, 73 (12.8%) became infected with HIV during the 2-year follow-up (6% HIV incidence). Compared to those without HIV, more participants with HIV had any HPV type present (97.3% vs. 87.6%, respectively, p = .01), more than one HPV type (79.5% vs. 58.2%, p < .01), or high-risk HPV (72.6% vs. 51.4%, p < .01). Some participants lost to follow-up could have been HIV-positive, which would have affected the relationship of HPV and HIV infection. Our prospective study showed that participants with any HPV type, more than one HPV type, or high-risk HPV were more likely to test positive for HIV. Although most studies have shown HPV–HIV coinfection, our findings illustrate the strong relationship between individual HPV types and HIV infection. This further illustrates the potential utility of HPV vaccine for MSM and TW, not only for HPV prevention but also possibly for HIV prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2893913148,"Introduction Patient registries play an important role in obtaining real-world evidence of the cost-effectiveness of treatments. However, their implementation is costly and sometimes infeasible in many middle-income countries (MICs). We explored the combination of data-mining and a large claims database to estimate the direct healthcare costs of HER2-positive breast cancer (BC) treatment in Iran and the fraction of total costs from trastuzumab use. Method We performed a retrospective analysis of claims data from the Iran Social Security Organization, a health insurer which covers approximately 50%(~40 million) of the Iranian population, in the period of 21/03/2011-20/03/2014. A data-mining algorithm using R software and validated using patient dossiers in the Cancer Research Center identified 1295 patients and divided them into the three main HER2-positive breast cancer stages (early, loco-regional and advanced). A payer perspective was used to calculate the absolute and relative direct costs of healthcare services associated with the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer in the public and private healthcare systems. Results The number of women totaled 802 (early), 125 (loco-regional) and 218 (advanced). The mean age[SD] was 45[10], 46[10] and 48[10] years, respectively, while mean follow-up in all stages was approximately one year. Average costs of direct healthcare care in early, loco-regional and advanced stages were €11,796 (95%CI: €9,356-€12,498), €8,253 (95%CI: €6,843-€10,002), and €17,742 (95%CI: €15,720-€19,505), respectively. Trastuzumab accounted for the largest share of total costs in all three stages (range: 53–76%). Conclusion Wherever comprehensive patient registries are infeasible or costly, real-world costs can be estimated through claims databases and data-mining strategies. Using this method, real-world costs have been estimated in Iran. The stage-specific cost estimates derived from this study can be used to perform real-world cost-effectiveness analyses of therapies for HER2-positive BC and support healthcare financing decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2894585215,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major etiological agent of various public health issues, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. EV71 causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) and is associated with serious neurological disorders in young children. A formalin-inactivated EV71 candidate vaccine (KCDC-HFMDV1-EV71) based on the C4 subgenotype was previously developed and confirmed to be a potential candidate vaccine for prevention of EV71 infection in mice. In this study, an inactivated EV71 vaccine was used for analysis of long-term immunogenicity and efficacy in cynomolgus monkeys, a common nonhuman primate model. The vaccine was immunized three times at 0, 4, and 8 weeks with either 20-μg doses of EV71 candidate vaccine formulated with aluminum hydroxide gel adjuvant or phosphate-buffered saline as a control. The group immunized with the inactivated EV71 showed significantly increased EV71-specific antibody and serum neutralizing antibody titers at 3 weeks after vaccination and maintained these elevated titers until the end of the experiment (54 weeks after vaccination). The sera from vaccinated cynomolgus monkeys showed a crossreactive neutralizing antibody response to the heterologous subtype of EV71 (B1-4, C1, and C2). These findings suggest that the inactivated EV71 candidate vaccine may be a potential vaccine candidate and valuable tool for the control of HFMD."
https://openalex.org/W2895143697,"Channelopsins and photo-regulated ion channels make it possible to use light to control electrical activity of cells. This powerful approach has lead to a veritable explosion of applications, though it is limited to changing membrane voltage of the target cells. An enormous potential could be tapped if similar opto-genetic techniques could be extended to the control of chemical signaling pathways. Photopigments from invertebrate photoreceptors are an obvious choice-as they do not bleach upon illumination -however, their functional expression has been problematic. We exploited an unusual opsin, pScop2, recently identified in ciliary photoreceptors of scallop. Phylogenetically, it is closer to vertebrate opsins, and offers the advantage of being a bi-stable photopigment. We inserted its coding sequence and a fluorescent protein reporter into plasmid vectors and demonstrated heterologous expression in various mammalian cell lines. HEK 293 cells were selected as a heterologous system for functional analysis, because wild type cells displayed the largest currents in response to the G-protein activator, GTP-γ-S. A line of HEK cells stably transfected with pScop2 was generated; after reconstitution of the photopigment with retinal, light responses were obtained in some cells, albeit of modest amplitude. In native photoreceptors pScop2 couples to Go; HEK cells express poorly this G-protein, but have a prominent Gq/PLC pathway linked to internal Ca mobilization. To enhance pScop2 competence to tap into this pathway, we swapped its third intracellular loop-important to confer specificity of interaction between 7TMDRs and G-proteins-with that of a Gq-linked opsin which we cloned from microvillar photoreceptors present in the same retina. The chimeric construct was evaluated by a Ca fluorescence assay, and was shown to mediate a robust mobilization of internal calcium in response to illumination. The results project pScop2 as a potentially powerful optogenetic tool to control signaling pathways."
