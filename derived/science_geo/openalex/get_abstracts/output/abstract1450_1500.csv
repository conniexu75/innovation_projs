https://openalex.org/W2060839601,"Malignant neoplasms that develop in 12 recessive-lethal, larval mutants of Drosophila melanogaster are discussed. These mutations affect the adult optic neuroblasts and ganglion-mother cells in the larval brain, the imaginal discs, and the hematopoietic organs. The malignant neoplasms exhibit fast, autonomous growth, loss of the capacity for differentiation, increased mobility and invasiveness, lethality in situ and after transplantation, and histological, fine structural, and karyotypic abnormalities. Intermediate neoplasms are also found. These combine both benign and malignant qualities. They grow in a noninvasive, compact fashion, typical of benign tumors, yet they also exhibit malignant qualities such as fast, autonomous, and lethal growth, loss of differentiation capacity, changes in cellular morphology, and lethal growth after transplantation into wild-type hosts. Thus Drosophila and vertebrate neoplasms show striking similarities."
https://openalex.org/W2031656934,"HLA-A and HLA-B antigens are integral membrane glycoproteins which consist of a glycosylated heavy chain embedded in the membrane in noncovalent association with beta 2-microglobulin, a water-soluble polypeptide. The assembly and maturation of these antigens has been studied in vivo in the human B lymphoblastoid cell line T5-1 (HLA-A1, -A2, -B8, -B27). Two antigenically distinct populations of HLA-A and -B heavy chains can be detected by antisera which recognize determinants sensitive to the conformation of the heavy chain. One heavy chain population is associated with beta 2-microglobulin, whereas the other population is not. These populations can be further distinguished by their oligosaccharide structure and their localization within the cell. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrate a precursor-product relationship between these heavy chain populations and suggest the following pathway for the assembly and maturation of HLA-A and -B antigens. The completed heavy chains initially carry high mannose oligosaccharides and are largely or wholly associated with beta 2-microglobulin. During the next 10-15 min, association with beta 2-microglobulin occurs and the heavy chain conformation is altered. Beginning at about 30 min after synthesis, the oligosaccharides are converted from the high mannose form to the complex form, and between 60 and 80 min after synthesis, the mature antigens appear at the cell surface. These observations are discussed in relation to in vivo and in vitro studies on the biosynthesis of a variety of secreted proteins and membrane proteins."

Recurrent focal epileptiform discharge caused by cortical injection of iron salts suggests that the development of human posttraumatic epilepsy may depend, in part, on the neurochemical alterations induced by the principal metallic ions found in whole blood."

https://openalex.org/W1550118454,"The relationship between human cold-insoluble globulin (CIg, plasma fibronectin) and the human serum opsonic alpha2SB glycoprotein was investigated using immunochemical and biochemical techniques. The two proteins appeared to have identical molecular weights by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 3.3% gels; have identical migration in the native state on 2.7 to 27% gradient polyacrylamide gels; and have a similar amino acid composition within the accuracy of analysis. Human serum demonstrates antigenic identity when diffused against monospecific antisera to both proteins confirming the presence of common antigenic sites on both molecules. Purified human serum opsonic alpha2SB glycoprotein and purified CIg also demonstrate antigenic identity when diffused against monospecific antiserum to either of the isolated proteins. Antiserum to both proteins also inhibits in vitro hepatic Kupffer cell phagocytic uptake of test particles. These results suggest the idenity of these two proteins and reveal a major physiological function for human plasma CIg. Thus, CIg may be important in the regulation of hepatic reticuloendothelial phagocytic activity and nonspecific systemic host defense. This process of systemic host defense has been shown to be depressed in patients following trauma, major surgery, burn injury, and during neoplastic disease, and, in part, mediated by a deficiency or depletion of the alpha2SB glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1493409554,"Prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine vesicular gland microsomes contained iron far below the equimolar amount and essentially no heme. However, the enzyme required various metalloporphyrins including hematin or several hemoproteins such as hemoglobin. Preincubation of the enzyme with hematin or hemoglobin resulted in the loss of enzyme activity. The enzyme inactivation was protected by tryptophan or various other aromatic compounds. Furthermore, the simultaneous presence of tryptophan brought about activation of enzyme; namely, the enzyme preincubated with heme and tryptophan showed an almost full activity with a heme concentration in the reaction mixture far below the saturating level. Such inactivation and activation of the enzyme were also observed with manganese protoporphyrin. An identical heme requirement, heme-induced inactivation, and activation of the enzyme were observed in three types of reactions catalyzed by the enzyme: 1) bis-dioxygenation of 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid to produce prostaglandin G1, 2) 15-hydroperoxide cleavage of prostaglandin G1 to produce prostaglandin H1, and 3) guaiacol peroxidation. When heme was replaced by manganese protoporphyrin, the enzyme catalyzed only the bis-dioxygenation producing prostaglandin G1 and the activities of the latter two reactions were not detectable."

A choice trial was available every 15 minutes continuously for 8 days. The animals chose cocaine almost exclusively, which resulted in high cocaine intake, decreased food intake, weight loss, and marked behavioral toxicity. The study provides evidence of the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine."

https://openalex.org/W1984778429,"Abstract In Drosophila melanogaster, the genes coding for 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA (rDNA) are clustered at one locus each on the X and the Y chromosomes. We have compared the structure of rDNA at the two loci. The 18S and 28S rRNAs coded by the X and Y chromosomes are very similar and probably identical (Maden and Tartof, 1974). In D. melanogaster, many rDNA repeating units are interrupted in the 28S RNA sequence by a DNA region called the insertion. There are at least two sequence types of insertions. Type 1 insertions include the most abundant 5 kilobase (kb) class and homologous small (0.5 and 1 kb) insertions. Most insertions between 1.5 and 4 kb have no homology to the 5 kb class and are identified as type 2 insertions. In X rDNA, about 49% of all rDNA repeats have type 1 insertions, and another 16% have type 2 insertions. On the Y chromosome, only 16% of all rDNA repeats are interrupted, and most if not all insertions are of type 2. rDNA fragments derived from the X and Y chromosomes have been cloned in E. coli. The homology between the nontranscribed spacers in X and Y rDNA was studied with cloned fragments. Stable heteroduplexes were found which showed that these regions on the two chromosomes are very similar. The evolution of rDNA in D. melanogaster might involve genetic exchange between the X and Y chromosomal clusters with restrictions on the movement of type 1 insertions to the Y chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2030937410,"Diet-induced atherosclerosis developed more extensively in vasectomized cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) than in sham-vasectomized control monkeys fed the same diet. The effect was most pronounced in the abdominal aortas, carotid arteries, distal segments of the coronary arteries, and intracranial cerebral arteries. Antibodies to sperm developed in all vasectomized monkeys, and complement and immunoglobulins were associated with atherosclerotic plaques in some of the vasectomized animals. The immunological response to sperm antigens that often accompanies vasectomy may exacerbate atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2015295302,"THE synthesis of secretory proteins is initiated on ribosomes in the cell cytoplasm and the first part of the polypeptide chain to appear is a short sequence termed the signal sequence1. This signal is thought to direct the ribosomal complex to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane where the synthesis of the rest of the secretory protein is tightly coupled to its transfer across the membrane into the cisternal space. In all but one case, it is clear that the polypeptide chain is processed during transfer to remove the signal sequence2,3. Little is known about the membrane proteins involved in conveying the growing polypeptide chain across the membrane. A classical approach to learning more about these proteins would be to dissect the microsomal membrane into inactive components that can be reassembled subsequently into a functional entity. This would allow the purification of components involved in protein transfer. Here we report the first such reassembly."

https://openalex.org/W1493942109,"Homologous series of alpha-mycolic acids from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra were separated according to size as their p-bromophenacyl ester by bonded C18 reverse-phase, high performance liquid chromatography. Mass spectrometry of the prominent components separated by high performance liquid chromatography gave relatively simple spectra and showed a series of components differing by 28 atomic mass units. A total of different structures were identified. The structures were established as follow: (formula see text) where a = 17, 18, 19; b = 10; c = 15, 17, 19, 21; and d = 21, 23. The C76 and C78 acids contained some C24 alpha-branch acid (d - 21), whereas the C80 and C82 acids contained some a = 19 acids. Several new homologous series were revealed."

https://openalex.org/W2005131604,"High concentrations (80 to 90 millimolar) of the calcium buffers EGTA and citrate (less than 10-7 molar free calcium ion) reversibly block excitation-contraction coupling in intact frog skeletal muscle fibers, but do not block caffeine-induced contractures. Solutions containing the same free calcium concentration but lower concentrations of calcium buffer (1 millimolar) do not block excitation-contraction coupling. These results suggest that excitation-contraction coupling requires the presence of calcium in a ""protected"" extracellular compartment, probably the transverse tubular network, and that calcium is actively transported into this compartment from the muscle cell cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1569297621,"We have isolated a mutant of Dictyostelium discoideum, M31, which produces a reduced number of alpha-mannosidase-1 molecules per cell during the developmental program of the organism. We find that several of the glycosidases, a group of lysosomal proteins produced by D. discoideum, are altered in strain M31 and that this strain produces a reduced level of at least three of these activities. These enzymes do not share a common protein subunit but are known to share a common antigenic determinant which is, in part, carbohydrate in nature. In the wild type parent of M31, alpha-mannosidase-1 is modified by the addition of mannose and glucosamine (probably as N-acetylglucosamine) in the molar ratio of 5:2. alpha-Mannosidase-1 was also found to contain phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues. alpha-Mannosidase-1 and other glycosidases are electrophoretically less negative when isolated from strain M31 than when isolated from wild type cells. The mutation present in M31, modA, appears to affect posttranslational modification, modA is a recessive mutation which we map onto linkage group I."
https://openalex.org/W2003686364,"When the fruiting myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca, a gliding prokaryote, is starved on an agar surface, the cells form multicellular aggregates resulting from morphogenetic movements. In the presence of incandescent light, each aggregate develops into a structurally complex fruiting body, possessing a stalk and several sporangia. In contrast, this pattern of development is not seen when cultures are incubated in the dark. The cells form irregular interconnecting aggregates, which rarely develop into fruits. However, aggregates formed in the light will develop into fruits even if placed in the dark, suggesting that the light produced a relatively stable alteration in the phenotype of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2073974858,"Computer-averaged auditory evoked potentials were found to be abnormal in infants hospitalized because of severe malnutrition (marasmus). They improved as the infants' somatic growth improved during the course of treatment, but were still deviant at the time of discharge from the hospital and at subsequent outpatient follow-up. Abnormalities in evoked potentials may reflect a long-lasting effect of malnutrition on brain function."

Several urinary metabolites were isolated and their structures elucidated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In addition to the major urinary metabolite, dinor-thromboxane B2, a series of metabolites resulting from dehydrogenetion of the alcohol group at C-11 were identified: 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2, 11-dehydro-15-keto-13,14-dihydro-2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2, and 11-dehydro-15-keto-13,14-dihydro-19-carboxyl-2,3,4,5-tetranor-thromboxane B2. 6-(1,3-dihydroxypropyl)-7-hydroxy-10-oxo-3-pentadecaenoic acid was also identified. Three mono-O-ethylated metabolites were formed from thromboxane B2, which in this study was infused in an ethanolic solution. A small quantity of thromboxane B2 was excreted unchanged into the urine."
https://openalex.org/W1582282327,"Abstract Hepatic microsomal azoreductase activity with amaranth (3-hydroxy-4[(4-sulfo-1-naphthalenyl)azo]-2,7-naphthalenedisulfonic acid trisodium salt) as a substrate is proportional to the levels of microsomal cytochrome P-450 from control or phenobarbital-pretreated rats and mice or cytochrome P-448 from 3-methylchol-anthrene-pretreated animals. In the inducible C57B/6J strain of mice, 3-methylcholanthrene and phenobarbital pretreatment cause an increase in cytochrome P-448 and P-450 levels, respectively, which is directly proportional to the increase of azoreductase activity. However, in the noninducible DBA/2J strain of mice, only phenobarbital treatment causes the increase both in cytochrome P-450 levels and azoreductase activity, while 3-methylcholanthrene has no effect. These experiments suggest that the P-450 type cytochromes are responsible for azoreductase activity in liver microsomes."

https://openalex.org/W1668255443,"NADPH-dependent flavin reductase (required for the activation of chorismate synthase) was purified to homogeneity from cell-free extracts of Bacillus subtilis. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 13,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, is specific for NADPH, and requires a divalent metal ion and either FMN or FAD for maximal rates of NADPH oxidation. The enzyme is able to reduce 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) in the presence of NADPH and a divalent metal ion. Both catalytic activities were completely inhibited by EDTA. The Km for FMN is 1.25 X 10(-5) M and for NADPH 7.8 X 10(-5) M with oxygen as the final electron acceptor, and 3.85 X 10(-4) M with DCIP as the final electron acceptor. The enzyme was also isolated in association with chorismate synthase and dehydroquinate synthase. The enzyme associated with the complex has the same catalytic properties as the dissociated enzyme except that it requires both a divalent metal ion and FMN for DCIP reduction. Maximal enzyme activity was observed when the enzyme was preincubated with FMN and the divalent metal ion. The enzyme complex is easily dissociable and the dissociation of the enzyme complex resulted in the failure of NADPH-dependent flavin reductase to adsorb to phosphocellulose."
https://openalex.org/W1516593618,"The site of attachment to beta-galactosidase of the active site-directed inhibitor, beta-D-galactopyranosylmethyl p-nitrophenyl triazene, was determined. When the enzyme is completely inactivated, 1 mol of the galactopyranosylmethyl group is bound per mol of monomer with retention of the tetrameric structure. After reaction with the [14C]methyl reagent, labeled peptides were isolated and analyzed. The radioactive label was found to be covalently bound to methionine residue 500."
https://openalex.org/W1559374036,"All of the 24 cyanogen bromide peptides of beta-galactosidase have been isolated in pure form. Of these 8 ranged in size from 2 to 5 residues and were purified by paper electrophoresis. The 16 large peptides, from 23 to 119 residues, were chromatographed at pH 5.0 on a carboxymethyl-cellulose column in 0.02 M ammonium acetate buffer containing 8 M urea. A number of peptides were obtained in pure from following Sephadex G-50 or G-75 gel filtration. Others were separated on sulfopropyl-Sephadex or diethyl-(2-hydroxylpropylaminoethyl)-Sephadex. There large peptides were obtained in over 50% yield and several others were obtained in more than 25% yield."

https://openalex.org/W1526214058,"Chorismatic synthase was purified to apparent homogeneity from Bacillus subtilis. The enzyme required NADPH-dependent flavin reductase, Mg2+, NADPH, and flavin (FMN or FAD) for activity. The molecular weight of chorismate synthase was 24,000 as determined by sodium dedecyl sulfate (SDS)-gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was also isolated in a complex form associated with NADPH-dependent flavin reductase and another enzyme of the aromatic amino acid pathway, dehydroquinate synthase. On SDS-gel electrophoresis, this form was resolved into three bands with molecular weights of 13,000, 17,000, and 24,000. The enzyme complex was easily dissociated and the dissociation resulted in a change in the chromatographic properties of NADPH-dependent flavin reductase which was no longer retained on phosphocellulose whereas chorismate synthase was still adsorbed. Chorismate synthase activity was linear with time and protein concentration, whereas partially purified preparations showed a significant lag period before the reaction took place. Moreover, crude or partially purified enzyme preparations were completely inactivated by dilution and the activity could be recovered by addition of flavin reductase. A possible role of NADPH-dependent flavin reductase in the activation and regulation of chorismate synthase activity is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1582959615,We have studied the effect of a post-translational modification mutation upon four developmentally regulated glycosidases of Dictyostelium discoideum. The presence of the modA mutation affects the intracellular level of these multimeric enzymes differently. The level of alpha-glucosidase is unaffected in the modA mutant. The mutant cell contains only a very small fraction of the wild type beta-glucosidase-1 activity. The alteration in modification renders beta-glucosidase-1 holoenzyme thermolabile and susceptible to degradation in vivo. alpha-Mannosidase-1 and N-acetylglucosaminidase are found at approximately 1/3 of the wild type level in the modA mutant. Degradation of holoenzyme does not appear to be responsible for the low level of these activities. We propose that alpha-mannosidase-1 and N-acetylglucosaminidase subunits are being degraded prior to subunit assembly. We conclude the modification bestows different properties upon the various glycosidases.
https://openalex.org/W1608387023,"Dehydroquinate synthase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) to 5-dehydroquinate, has been purified from Bacillus subtilis in association with chorismate synthase and NADPH-dependent flavin reductase. The enzyme was only active when associated with chorismate synthase, whereas the flavin reductase could be separated from the complex with retention of dehydroquinate synthase activity. The enzyme requires NAD and either Co2+ or Mn2+ for maximal activity. The activity was completely inhibited by EDTA. The Km of the enzyme for DAHP, NAD, and Co2+ were estimated to be 1.3 X 10(-4), 5.5 X 10(-5), and 5.5 X 10(-5) M, respectively. Enzyme activity was completely inhibited by NADH and the inhibition was not reversed by the addition of NAD, NADPH and NADP were not inhibitory. The enzyme was unstable to heat and lost all activity at 55 degrees C. A protein fraction which did not adsorb to phosphocellulose was found to inhibit the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1980764473,"THE number of genes in an organism is one of its fundamental biological parameters and relates to the number of functions required to construct that organism and determine its physiological characteristics. It is generally assumed that with increasing organic complexity the number of genes of the species must increase. The possibility does exist, however, that increasing complexity results from the effects of interactions between a small and relatively constant number of genes. The results presented here support the idea that the number of genes of the insect Drosophila is of the order of 5,000 and therefore not very different from the number of genes estimated for bacteria."

These peptides contain approximatley 500 amino acids, range in size from 2 to 26 residues, and give overlaps with tryptic peptides of 16 to 55 residues. Peptides from this digest and those reported earlier from tryptic digests account together for the sequence of about 600 of the 1021 residues in the subunit."
