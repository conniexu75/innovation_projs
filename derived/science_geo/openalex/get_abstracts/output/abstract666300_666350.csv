https://openalex.org/W3113228067,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits variable symptom severity ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening, yet the relationship between severity and the humoral immune response is poorly understood. We examined antibody responses in 113 COVID-19 patients and found that severe cases resulting in intubation or death exhibited increased inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and high anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody levels. Although anti-RBD immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels generally correlated with neutralization titer, quantitation of neutralization potency revealed that high potency was a predictor of survival. In addition to neutralization of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, patient sera were also able to neutralize the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 mutant D614G, suggesting cross-protection from reinfection by either strain. However, SARS-CoV-2 sera generally lacked cross-neutralization to a highly homologous pre-emergent bat coronavirus, WIV1-CoV, which has not yet crossed the species barrier. These results highlight the importance of neutralizing humoral immunity on disease progression and the need to develop broadly protective interventions to prevent future coronavirus pandemics."

Current treatments can cause systemic immune suppression and side effects such as increased risk of infections. Krienke et al. designed a messenger RNA vaccine strategy that lacks adjuvant activity and delivers MS autoantigens into lymphoid dendritic cells. This approach expands a distinct type of antigen-specific effector regulatory T cell that suppresses autoreactivity against targeted autoantigens and promotes bystander suppression of autoreactive T cells against other myelin-specific autoantigens. In mouse models of MS, the vaccine delayed the onset and reduced the severity of established disease without showing overt symptoms of general immune suppression. Science , this issue p. 145"

https://openalex.org/W3120854869,"Social transmission of pain and relief In mice, both pain and fear can be transferred by short social contact from one animal to a bystander. Neurons in a brain region called the anterior cingulate cortex in the bystander animal mediate these transfers. However, the specific anterior cingulate projections involved in such empathy-related behaviors are unknown. Smith et al. found that projections from the anterior cingulate cortex to the nucleus accumbens are necessary for the social transfer of pain in mice (see the Perspective by Klein and Gogolla). Fear, however, was mediated by projections from the anterior cingulate cortex to the basolateral amygdala. Interestingly, in animals with pain, analgesia can also be transferred socially.

Strong, short H-bonds constitute a separate class that, owing to their elusive characterization, has remained a point of contention over the past several decades. Using femtosecond two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy in conjunction with quantum chemical calculations, Dereka et al. demonstrate a powerful way to investigate the nature of short H-bonding (see the Perspective by Bonn and Hunger). Their quantitative characterization of multiple coupled motions in the model system of bifluoride anion [F-H-F] − in aqueous solution reveals several distinctive features of a crossover from conventional to short, strong H-bonding.

https://openalex.org/W3119474377,"Objectives Examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and loneliness in the general population. More specifically, the study focused on prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms, the extent to which individuals with existing symptoms recovered or not, the prevalence of subtypes of loneliness, and the extent to which loneliness before and during this pandemic was associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. Methods Data was extracted from the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a probability sample of the Dutch population, with assessments on loneliness in October 2019 (T1) and June 2020 (T4), and anxiety and depression symptoms in November 2019 (T2), March 2020 (T3) and June 2020 (T4; N total = 4,084). Loneliness was examined with the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale and anxiety and depression symptoms with the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). Results Repeated measures multivariate logistic regression analyses (RMMLRA) showed a statistical significant lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms after the outbreak (T4 = 15.3%) than before (T2 = 16.8%) and during the COVID-19 outbreak (T3 = 17.2%). According to the Reliable Change Index, the distribution of recovery categories (remission, improvement, unchanged and worsening symptoms) after the outbreak did not differ significantly from the distribution of these categories before the outbreak. RMMLRA revealed that the prevalence of emotional loneliness increased significantly after the outbreak (T1 = 18.4%, T4 = 24.8%). Among individuals who were not lonely before and after the outbreak the prevalence of symptoms decreased significantly (T2 = 7.0%, T4 = 4.4%) and, likewise, among those who were not lonely anymore after the outbreak (T2 = 21.5%, T4 = 14.5%). However, the prevalence of symptoms increased significantly among those who became lonely during the pandemic (T2 = 17.9%, T4 = 26.3%). Conclusions Findings suggest that this pandemic did not negatively affect the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms nor the normal recovery of symptoms among the general population during the first four months, but that emotional loneliness increased."
https://openalex.org/W3120461254,"Posttranslational modifications of the microtubule cytoskeleton have emerged as key regulators of cellular functions, and their perturbations have been linked to a growing number of human pathologies. Tubulin glycylation modifies microtubules specifically in cilia and flagella, but its functional and mechanistic roles remain unclear. In this study, we generated a mouse model entirely lacking tubulin glycylation. Male mice were subfertile owing to aberrant beat patterns of their sperm flagella, which impeded the straight swimming of sperm cells. Using cryo-electron tomography, we showed that lack of glycylation caused abnormal conformations of the dynein arms within sperm axonemes, providing the structural basis for the observed dysfunction. Our findings reveal the importance of microtubule glycylation for controlled flagellar beating, directional sperm swimming, and male fertility."

https://openalex.org/W3120974536,"Medically important flaviviruses cause diverse disease pathologies and collectively are responsible for a major global disease burden. A contributing factor to pathogenesis is secreted flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). Despite demonstrated protection by NS1-specific antibodies against lethal flavivirus challenge, the structural and mechanistic basis remains unknown. Here, we present three crystal structures of full-length dengue virus NS1 complexed with a flavivirus-cross-reactive, NS1-specific monoclonal antibody, 2B7, at resolutions between 2.89 and 3.96 angstroms. These structures reveal a protective mechanism by which two domains of NS1 are antagonized simultaneously. The NS1 wing domain mediates cell binding, whereas the β-ladder triggers downstream events, both of which are required for dengue, Zika, and West Nile virus NS1-mediated endothelial dysfunction. These observations provide a mechanistic explanation for 2B7 protection against NS1-induced pathology and demonstrate the potential of one antibody to treat infections by multiple flaviviruses."

The envelope protein (E) on the virus surface has been the target of vaccine development, but problems have arisen with antibodies against E, leading to enhanced infection. Now, Modhiran et al. and Biering et al. describe two different antibodies that bind to the flavivirus NS1 protein and prevent it from disrupting epithelial cells, which is associated with severe disease. Both antibodies cross-react with multiple flavivirus NS1 proteins. The antibodies reduce viremia and increase survival in mouse models of flavivirus disease. Both papers include structures of NS1 bound to an antibody, which give insight into the protective mechanism. Science , this issue p. 190 , p. 194"
https://openalex.org/W3120784508,"As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, researchers from all disciplines are coming together and contributing their expertise. CORD-19, a dataset of COVID-19 and coronavirus publications, has been made available alongside calls to help mine the information it contains and to create tools to search it more effectively. We analyse the delineation of the publications included in CORD-19 from a scientometric perspective. Based on a comparison to the Web of Science database, we find that CORD-19 provides an almost complete coverage of research on COVID-19 and coronaviruses. CORD-19 contains not only research that deals directly with COVID-19 and coronaviruses, but also research on viruses in general. Publications from CORD-19 focus mostly on a few well-defined research areas, in particular: coronaviruses (primarily SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2); public health and viral epidemics; molecular biology of viruses; influenza and other families of viruses; immunology and antivirals; clinical medicine. CORD-19 publications that appeared in 2020, especially editorials and letters, are disproportionately popular on social media. While we fully endorse the CORD-19 initiative, it is important to be aware that CORD-19 extends beyond research on COVID-19 and coronaviruses."
https://openalex.org/W3119974640,"Decision-making strategies evolve during training and can continue to vary even in well-trained animals. However, studies of sensory decision-making tend to characterize behavior in terms of a fixed psychometric function that is fit only after training is complete. Here, we present PsyTrack, a flexible method for inferring the trajectory of sensory decision-making strategies from choice data. We apply PsyTrack to training data from mice, rats, and human subjects learning to perform auditory and visual decision-making tasks. We show that it successfully captures trial-to-trial fluctuations in the weighting of sensory stimuli, bias, and task-irrelevant covariates such as choice and stimulus history. This analysis reveals dramatic differences in learning across mice and rapid adaptation to changes in task statistics. PsyTrack scales easily to large datasets and offers a powerful tool for quantifying time-varying behavior in a wide variety of animals and tasks."
https://openalex.org/W3121104944,"Antisocial behaviors cause harm, directly or indirectly, to others’ welfare. The novel coronavirus pandemic has increased the urgency of understanding a specific form of antisociality: behaviors that increase risk of disease transmission. Because disease transmission-linked behaviors tend to be interpreted and responded to differently than other antisocial behaviors, it is unclear whether general indices of antisociality predict contamination-relevant behaviors. In a pre-registered study using an online U.S. sample, we found that individuals reporting high levels of antisociality engage in fewer social distancing measures: they report leaving their homes more frequently (p = .024) and standing closer to others while outside (p &lt; .001). These relationships were observed after controlling for sociodemographic variables, illness risk, and use of protective equipment. Independently, higher education and leaving home for work were also associated with reduced distancing behavior. Antisociality was not significantly associated with level of worry about the coronavirus. These findings suggest that more antisocial individuals may pose health risks to themselves and their community during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3119446481,"Colonization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae as animal gut microbiota is a substantial global threat. This study aimed to determine the molecular characterization of bla SHV , bla TEM , and bla CTX-M variants in animals, as well as to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance conferred by these genes. We prospectively analyzed 1273 fecal specimens of farm and domestic animals for the isolation of enterobacteria that had the ESBL phenotype by using biochemical methods. The extracted genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced for the characterization of bla SHV , bla TEM , and bla CTX-M variants. The drug-resistance spectrum and hierarchical clusters were analyzed against 19 antibacterial agents. Out of 245 (19.2%) ESBL enterobacteria, 180 (75.5%) Escherichia coli and 34 (13.9%) Klebsiella pneumoniae were prevalent species. A total of 73.9% bla CTX-M , 26.1% bla TEM , and 14.2% bla SHV were found among the enterobacteria; however, their association with farm or domestic animals was not statistically significant. The distribution of bla gene variants showed the highest number of bla CTX-M-1 (133; 54.3%), followed by bla CTX-M-15 (28; 11.4%), bla TEM-52 (40; 16.3%), and bla SHV-12 (22; 9%). In addition, 84.5% of the enterobacteria had the integrons intI1 . We observed ±100% enterobacteria resistant to cephalosporin, 7 (2.9%) to colistin (minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoint ≥4 μg/mL), 9 (3.7%) to piperacillin-tazobactam, 11 (4.5%) to imipenem, 14 (5.7%) to meropenem, and 18 (7.3%) to cefoperazone-sulbactam, without statistically significant association. Animal gut microbiota contain a considerable number of bla CTX-M , bla TEM , bla SHV , and integrons, which are a potential source of acquired extensive drug resistance in human strains and leaves fewer therapeutic substitutes."
https://openalex.org/W3119731794,"Here, we argue that, in line with the dramatic increase in the collection, storage and curation of human genomic data for biomedical research, genomic data repositories and consortia have adopted governance frameworks to both enable wide access and protect against possible harms. However, the merits and limitations of different governance frameworks in achieving these twin aims are a matter of ongoing debate in the scientific community; indeed, best practices and points for consideration are notably absent in devising governance frameworks for genomic databases. According to our collective experience in devising and assessing governance frameworks, we identify five key functions of ‘good governance’ (or ‘better governance’) and three areas in which trade-offs should be considered when specifying policies within those functions. We apply these functions as a benchmark to describe, as an example, the governance frameworks of six large-scale international genomic projects."
https://openalex.org/W3120890309,"Polyadenylate [poly(A)] tail addition to the 3' end of a wide range of RNAs is a highly conserved modification that plays a central role in cellular RNA function. Elements for nuclear expression (ENEs) are cis-acting RNA elements that stabilize poly(A) tails by sequestering them in RNA triplex structures. A crystal structure of a double ENE from a rice hAT transposon messenger RNA complexed with poly(A)28 at a resolution of 2.89 angstroms reveals multiple modes of interaction with poly(A), including major-groove triple helices, extended minor-groove interactions with RNA double helices, a quintuple-base motif that transitions poly(A) from minor-groove associations to major-groove triple helices, and a poly(A) 3'-end binding pocket. Our findings both expand the repertoire of motifs involved in long-range RNA interactions and provide insights into how polyadenylation can protect an RNA's extreme 3' end."
https://openalex.org/W3119890564,"Fumonisins (FBs) and zearalenone (ZEN) are mycotoxins which occur naturally in grains and cereals, especially maize, causing negative effects on animals and humans. Along with the need for constant monitoring, there is a growing demand for rapid, non-destructive methods. Among these, Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) has made great headway for being an easy-to-use technology. NIR was applied in the present research to quantify the contamination level of total FBs, i . e ., fumonisin B 1 +fumonisin B 2 (FB 1 +FB 2 ), and ZEN in Brazilian maize. From a total of six hundred and seventy-six samples, 236 were analyzed for FBs and 440 for ZEN. Three regression models were defined: one with 18 principal components (PCs) for FB 1 , one with 10 PCs for FB 2 , and one with 7 PCs for ZEN. Partial least square regression algorithm with full cross-validation was applied as internal validation. External validation was performed with 200 unknown samples (100 for FBs and 100 for ZEN). Correlation coefficient (R), determination coefficient (R 2 ), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), standard error of prediction (SEP) and residual prediction deviation (RPD) for FBs and ZEN were, respectively: 0.809 and 0.991; 0.899 and 0.984; 659 and 69.4; 682 and 69.8; and 3.33 and 2.71. No significant difference was observed between predicted values using NIR and reference values obtained by Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), thus indicating the suitability of NIR to rapidly analyze a large numbers of maize samples for FBs and ZEN contamination. The external validation confirmed a fair potential of the model in predicting FB 1 +FB 2 and ZEN concentration. This is the first study providing scientific knowledge on the determination of FBs and ZEN in Brazilian maize samples using NIR, which is confirmed as a reliable alternative methodology for the analysis of such toxins."

We determined the influence of travel time from mother’s area of residence to a tertiary health facility where women sought care on the likelihood of delivering a stillbirth. We carried out a prospective matched case-control study between 1st January 2019 and 31st December 2019 at the Federal Teaching Hospital Gombe (FTHG), Nigeria. All women who experienced a stillbirth after hospital admission during the study period were included as cases while controls were consecutive age-matched (ratio 1:1) women who experienced a live birth. We modelled travel time to health facilities. To determine how travel time to the nearest health facility and the FTHG were predictive of the likelihood of stillbirths, we fitted a conditional logistic regression model. A total of 318 women, including 159 who had stillborn babies (cases) and 159 age-matched women who had live births (controls) were included. We did not observe any significant difference in the mean travel time to the nearest government health facility for women who had experienced a stillbirth compared to those who had a live birth [9.3 mins (SD 7.3, 11.2) vs 6.9 mins (SD 5.1, 8.7) respectively, p = 0.077]. However, women who experienced a stillbirth had twice the mean travel time of women who had a live birth (26.3 vs 14.5 mins) when measured from their area of residence to the FTHG where deliveries occurred. Women who lived farther than 60 minutes were 12 times more likely of having a stillborn [OR = 12 (1.8, 24.3), p = 0.011] compared to those who lived within 15 minutes travel time to the FTHG. We have shown for the first time, the influence of travel time to a major tertiary referral health facility on the occurrence of stillbirths in an urban city in, northeast Nigeria."

A total of 67 young male athletes participated in this study, who were classified as soccer (n = 40; 15.55 ± 1.5 y; 1.76 ± 0.12 m; 58.15 ± 10.82 kg; 19.84 ± 2.98 kg·m 2 ) and basketball (n = 27; 15.7 ± 1.66 y; 1.76 ± 0.12 m; 62.33 ± 16.57 kg; 19.84 ± 2.98 kg·m 2 ) players. Participants were asked to perform bilateral and unilateral multidirectional jumps, and passive ROM of hip (flexion, extension and abduction), knee (flexion) and ankle (dorsiflexion) joints was also assessed. Significant between-group differences were observed for hip extension with flexed knee ROM in dominant (soccer: 142.43 ± 7.74°; basketball: 148.63 ± 8.10°) and non-dominant (soccer: 144.38 ± 8.36°; basketball: 148.63 ± 6.45°) legs; hip flexion with flexed knee ROM in dominant (soccer: 13.26 ± 4.71°; basketball: 9.96 ± 3.42°) and non-dominant (soccer: 12.86 ± 4.55°; basketball: 9.70 ± 3.62°) legs; and for the ratio of hip abduction (soccer: 1.02 ± 0.08; basketball: 0.97 ± 0.11). However, no significant between-group differences were observed for bilateral and unilateral jump capacity, or for inter-limb asymmetries (dominant vs. non-dominant leg). Finally, no associations were observed between ROM ratio (dominant vs. non-dominant leg) and bilateral jump performance. These findings lead to the suggestion that differences on passive ROM values in young male athletes may be sport-specific. Additionally, there seems to be need for the implementation of training strategies specifically aimed at improving bilateral or unilateral jump ability, or at diminishing inter limb passive ROM differences in order to improve multidirectional jump performance for neither soccer nor basketball youth male players."

These meteorites contain evidence of reactions with liquid water that was thought to have been lost or completely frozen billions of years ago. Turner et al. examined uranium and thorium isotopes in several carbonaceous chondrites, finding nonequilibrium distributions that imply that uranium ions were transported by fluid flow. Because this signature disappears after several half-lives of the radioactive isotopes, the meteorites must have been exposed to liquid within the past million years.

https://openalex.org/W3118719543,"Background Impaired perfusion indices signal potential microvascular dysfunction preceding atherosclerosis and other cardiometabolic pathologies. Post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH), a vasodilatory response following a mechanically induced ischemia, is a transient increase in perfusion and can assess microvascular function. The greatest blood flow change corresponding to the first minute of hyperemia (represented by time-to-peak, hyperemic velocity, AUC within 1 st min) has been shown to indicate microvascular dysfunction. However, the reproducibility of these temporal kinetic indices of the PORH response is unknown. Our aim was to examine the inter- and intra-day reproducibility and standardization of reactive hyperemia, with emphasis on the kinetic indices of PORH, using laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) technique. Methods and results Seventeen healthy adults (age = 24 ± 3 years) completed three PORH bouts over two lab visits. LSCI region of interest was a standardized 10 cm region on the dominant ventral forearm. A 5-min brachial artery occlusion period induced by inflating an arm cuff to 200 mmHg, preceded a 4-min hyperemic period. Inter- and intra-day reliability and reproducibility of cutaneous vascular conductance (LSCI flux / mean arterial pressure) were determined using intraclass correlation (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV%). Maximal flow and area under the curve standardized to zero perfusion showed intra- and inter-day reliability (ICC &gt; 0.70). Time to maximal flow (TMF) was not reproducible (inter-day CV = 18%). However, alternative kinetic indices such as 1-min AUC and overshoot rate-of-change (ORC), represented as a piecewise function (at 5s, 10s, 15s, and 20s into hyperemia), were reproducible (CV&lt; 11%). Biological zero was a reliable normalization point. Conclusion PORH measured with LSCI is a reliable assessment of microvascular function. However, TMF or its derived hyperemic velocity are not recommended for longitudinal assessment. Piecewise ORC and 1-min AUC are reliable alternatives to assess the kinetic response of PORH."
https://openalex.org/W3119481844,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents approximately 10–15% of all breast cancers and has a poor outcome as it lacks a receptor target for therapy, and TNBC is frequently associated with a germline mutation of BRCA1 . Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) drugs have demonstrated some effectiveness in treating BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutated breast and ovarian cancers but resistance to PARPi is common. Published results found that resistance to Olaparib, a PARPi, can be due to downregulation of EMI1 and the consequent upregulation of the RAD51 recombinase. Using a tissue culture-based cell viability assay, we extended those observations to another PARPi and to other chemotherapy drugs that affect DNA repair or the cell cycle. As we expected, EMI1 downregulation resulted in resistance to another PARPi drug, Talazoparib. EMI1 downregulation also led to resistance to other cytotoxic drugs, Cisplatin and CHK1 inhibitor. Notably, increasing the RAD51 protein expression only recapitulated some, but not all, of the effects of EMI1 depletion in conferring to the cell resistance to different PARPi and the other cytotoxic drugs. These results suggest that the downstream effects of EMI1 downregulation that contribute to PARPi resistance are increasing the concentration of RAD51 protein in the cell and blocking mitotic entry. We found that combining CHK1 inhibitor with olaparib results in restoration of sensitivity even when EMI1 expression is downregulated. This combination therapy may be a means to overcome the PARPi resistance in BRCA1-deficient TNBC cells."

Here, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) in combination with a lateral-flow biosensor (LFB) was developed for visual inspection of C . perfringens -specific cpa gene. The specificity of the developed test was evaluated against 40 C . perfringens and 35 other bacterial strains, which showed no cross-reactivity, indicating 100% inclusivity and exclusivity. LAMP-LFB detection limit for artificially contaminated samples after enrichment for 16 h was 1–10 CFU/g sample, which was comparable to the commercial real-time PCR kit. The detection performance of LAMP-LFB was also compared to culture-based method using 95 food samples, which revealed the sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP) and Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) of 88.0% (95% CI, 75.6%-95.4%), 95.5% (95% CI, 84.8%-99.4%) and 0.832 (95% CI, 0.721–0.943), respectively. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.918 (95% CI, 0.854–0.981), indicating LAMP-LFB as high relative accuracy test.

This study aimed to identify the association between health behavior patterns and the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages among Brazilian adolescents from a nationally representative school-based study. A cross-sectional study analyzed data from 71,553 adolescents aged 12–17 years who attended public and private schools in Brazilian cities, from the Study of Cardiovascular Risk in Adolescents. Principal component analysis was performed to identify health behavior patterns, and ordered logistic regression was performed to identify the association between health behavior patterns and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption. Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (mL/day) was used as the dependent variable. The analyses were performed using Stata software version 14.0 with a significance level of 0.05. Patterns 2 (alcoholic beverage and smoking habit) and 3 (ultra-processed food and screen time) of health behaviors and regularly purchasing snacks in the school cafeteria increased the odds of sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, while pattern 1 (water, unprocessed and minimally processed food and physical activity) decreased these odds. The adoption of healthy habits can indirectly stimulate the adoption of other habits beneficial to health. These results indicate the importance of adopting a set of regulatory measures to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption."

Cone densities and signal compositions were investigated in four different planes: the cone inner segment outer segment junction (IS/OS), the cone outer segment combined with the IS/OS (ISOS+), the cone outer segment tips (COST) and full en-face plane (FEF) combining signals from all mentioned cone layers. Additionally, reliability of a simple semi-automated approach for assessment of cone density was tested. Main outcome measures. Cone density of IS/OS, IS/OS+, COST and FEF. Qualitative depiction and composition of each cone layer. Inter-rater agreement of cone density measurements. Results Mean overall cone density at all eccentricities was highest at the FEF plane (21.160/mm 2 ), followed by COST (20.450/mm 2 ), IS/OS+ (19.920/mm 2 ) and IS/OS (19.530/mm 2 ). The different meridians and eccentricities had a significant impact on cone density, with lower eccentricity resulting in higher cone densities (p≤.001), which were highest at the nasal, then temporal, then inferior and then superior meridian. Depiction of the cone mosaic differed between all 4 layers regarding signal size and packing density. Therefore, different cone layers showed evident but not complete signal overlap. Using the semi-automated technique for counting of cone signals achieved high inter-rater reliability (ICC &gt; .99). Conclusions In healthy individuals qualitative and quantitative changes in cone signals are found not only in different eccentricities and meridians, but also within different photoreceptor layers. The variation between cone planes has to be considered when assessing the integrity of cone photoreceptors in healthy and diseased eyes using adaptive optics technology."

https://openalex.org/W3119598991,"The present study examined the patterns of use among a sample of 68 users of hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms in Slovenia. In compiling the lists of all the participants, 26 different plants/mushrooms, mixtures, or products were found to have been used. The main reason for beginning to use these substances was curiosity, and most people began using them in their 20s. The most used were Psilocybe spp., being mentioned by approximately 91% of the participants; 50% of the respondents in the study had made use of no other natural hallucinogens besides these. Many of the plants or mushrooms were used only a small number of times. No matter what items had been used, the internet often played a role in first hearing about them. Dosing and the means of using the various hallucinogens were often quite varied, as were the settings where they were taken. Knowledge of the dangers of these hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms as well as their occurrence in nature were likewise vastly varied. Though public opinion often associates the use of mind-altering substances with problematic drug use and partying, the majority of the individuals interviewed seemed to present a greater desire to experience the interesting effects, to overcome personal difficulties, and for individual and spiritual growth."
https://openalex.org/W3118479834,"Background Interleukin-18 (IL-18) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) are cytokines of crucial role in inflammation and immune reactions. There is a growing evidence supporting important roles for IL-18 and IFN γ in tuberculosis (TB) infection and anti-tuberculosis immunity. Objective To evaluate the role of polymorphisms in IL-18-607 and -137 and INF-γ +874 in susceptibility to TB infection among Egyptian patients. Methods A case control study was conducted to investigate the polymorphism at IL-18-607, -137 and INF-γ+874 by sequence specific primer-polymerase chain reaction (SSP- PCR) in 105 patients with pulmonary and extra pulmonary tuberculosis and 106 controls. Results A significant protective effect against TB was found in homozygous CC genotype at IL-18 -137G/C, in addition to a 7-fold risk with GG and GC genotypes in the recessive model. Apart from a decreased risk with the AC genotype, no association was detected between the susceptibility to TB and different genotypes or alleles at the IL-18 -607A/C site. The homozygous AA genotype in INF-γ+874 showed a significant higher risk to TB than the homozygous TT or heterozygous AT genotypes with nearly a 2-fold risk of TB infection with the A allele. Regarding haplotype association, the GC haplotype was strongly associated with TB infection compared to other haplotypes. Conclusion These findings suggest; for the first time in Egypt; a significant risk to TB infection with SNP at the IL-18-137G/C with no LD with SNP at the IL-18-607 site. The homozygous AA genotype in INF-γ+874 showed a significant higher risk to TB than the homozygous TT or heterozygous AT genotypes."

https://openalex.org/W3118347723,"Objectives Working-aged colorectal cancer (CRC) patients have a much better survival, indicating the importance of their future work situation. We investigated trajectories of sickness absence and disability pension (SADP) days before and after CRC diagnosis, and risk factors associated with different trajectories. Methods A longitudinal, population-based matched cohort study of 4735 CRC survivors in Sweden aged 19–62 when first diagnosed with CRC in 2008–2011, and 18,230 matched references was conducted, using microdata linked from several nationwide registers. The annual SADP net days for 2 years before through 5 years after diagnosis date were computed. A group-based trajectory model was used to depict SADP trajectories. Associations between trajectory membership, and sociodemographic and clinical variables were tested by chi 2 test and multinomial logistic regression. Results Four trajectories of SADP days/year for CRC survivors were identified: “only increase around diagnosis” (52% of all), “slight increase after diagnosis” (27%), “high then decrease moderately after diagnosis” (13%), and “constantly very high” (8%). Educational level, Charlson’s Comorbidity Index, and prediagnostic mental disorders were the strongest factors determining the SADP trajectory groups. In references, three trajectories (“constantly low” (80% of all), “constantly moderate and decrease gradually” (12%), and “very high then decrease overtime” (8%)) were identified. Conclusion Approximately 80% of CRC survivors return to a low level of SADP at 5 years postdiagnosis. Prediagnostic status of mental disorders, somatic comorbidity, and low educational level are good indicators of future high SADP levels for them. CRC survivors will benefit from early rehabilitation programs with identified risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3120602780,"Objectives Anti-IL-17/23 biologics are increasingly used to treat psoriasis. We aimed to elucidate characteristics of drug-induced interstitial pneumonia (DIIP) caused by anti-IL-17/23 biologics. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of psoriasis patients treated with anti-IL-17/23 biologics. Chest CT was performed to evaluate DIIP. Serum KL-6 levels were measured before treatment (baseline) and during treatment. Results A total of 603 psoriasis patients were treated with anti-IL-17/23 biologics with mean follow-up of 21.1 months. Six patients developed DIIP at mean 14 months after initiation of the therapy. Older age, higher baseline KL-6 value and more frequent pre-existing IPs were associated with development of DIIP by univariate analysis. At the onset of DIIP, elevated serum KL-6 levels with concomitantly increased ground glass opacity (GGO) in Chest CT were demonstrated. DIIP was improved by only cessation of causative agents in five patients but steroid therapy was needed in one patient. Conclusions DIIP is a plausible complication of anti-IL-17/23 biologics. Age, baseline KL-6 level and underlying IP could be the risk factors for DIIP development. Serum KL-6 levels and chest CT are useful for not only predicting but also detecting DIIP caused by anti-IL-17/23 biologics."
https://openalex.org/W3120685249,"Understanding the spatial and temporal distributions and fluctuations of living populations is a central goal in ecology and demography. A scaling pattern called Taylor's law has been used to quantify the distributions of populations. Taylor's law asserts a linear relationship between the logarithm of the mean and the logarithm of the variance of population size. Here, extending previous work, we use generalized least-squares models to describe three types of Taylor's law. These models incorporate the temporal and spatial autocorrelations in the mean-variance data. Moreover, we analyze three purely statistical models to predict the form and slope of Taylor's law. We apply these descriptive and predictive models of Taylor's law to the county population counts of the United States decennial censuses (1790–2010). We find that the temporal and spatial autocorrelations strongly affect estimates of the slope of Taylor's law, and generalized least-squares models that take account of these autocorrelations are often superior to ordinary least-squares models. Temporal and spatial autocorrelations combine with demographic factors (e.g., population growth and historical events) to influence Taylor's law for human population data. Our results show that the assumptions of a descriptive model must be carefully evaluated when it is used to estimate and interpret the slope of Taylor's law."
https://openalex.org/W3118557724,"Human language permits us to call to mind objects, events, and ideas that we cannot witness directly. This capacity rests upon abstract verbal reference: the appreciation that words are linked to mental representations that can be established, retrieved and modified, even when the entities to which a word refers is perceptually unavailable. Although establishing verbal reference is a pivotal achievement, questions concerning its developmental origins remain. To address this gap, we investigate infants' ability to establish a representation of an object, hidden from view, from language input alone. In two experiments, 15-month-olds (N = 72) and 12-month-olds (N = 72) watch as an actor names three familiar, visible objects; she then provides a novel name for a fourth, hidden fully from infants' view. In the Semantic Priming condition, the visible familiar objects all belong to the same semantic neighborhood (e.g., apple, banana, orange). In the No Priming condition, the objects are drawn from different semantic neighborhoods (e.g., apple, shoe, car). At test infants view two objects. If infants can use the naming information alone to identify the likely referent, then infants in the Semantic Priming, but not in the No Priming condition, will successfully infer the referent of the fourth (hidden) object. Brief summary of results here. Implications for the development of abstract verbal reference will be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3118643798,"This study aims to investigate cholesterol metabolism in a mouse model with cystic fibrosis (CF) by the comparison of affected homozygous versus wild type (WT) mice. In particular, we evaluated the effects of a diet enriched with cholesterol in both mice groups in comparison with the normal diet. To this purpose, beyond serum and liver cholesterol, we analyzed serum phytosterols as indirect markers of intestinal absorption of cholesterol, liver lathosterol as indirect marker of de novo cholesterol synthesis, liver cholestanol (a catabolite of bile salts synthesis) and the liver mRNA levels of LDL receptor ( LDLR ), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase ( HMG-CoAR ), acyl CoA : cholesterol acyl transferase 2 ( ACAT2 ), cytochrome P450 7A1 ( CYP7A1 ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα ). CF mice showed lower intestinal absorption and higher liver synthesis of cholesterol than WT mice. In WT mice, the cholesterol supplementation inhibits the synthesis of liver cholesterol and enhances its catabolism, while in CF mice we did not observe a reduction of LDLR and HMG-CoAR expression (probably due to an altered feed-back), causing an increase of intracellular cholesterol. In addition, we observed a further increase (5-fold) in TNFα mRNA levels. This preliminary study suggests that in CF mice there is a vicious circle in which the altered synthesis/secretion of bile salts may reduce the digestion/absorption of cholesterol. As a result, the liver increases the biosynthesis of cholesterol that accumulates in the cells, triggering inflammation and further compromising the metabolism of bile salts."
https://openalex.org/W3118975941,"The objective of this study was to determine if parity affected the effect of pegbovigrastim (PEG) treatment on white blood cell (WBC) counts in grazing dairy cows. Additionally, the association of prepartum body condition score (BCS) and non-esterified fatty acid (Pre-NEFA) concentration with WBC counts was investigated. The effect of early-lactation disease was included in the statistical analysis. A randomized controlled trial on four commercial grazing dairy farms was performed. Holstein primiparous (Control = 87, PEG = 89) and multiparous (Control = 181, PEG = 184) cows were randomly assigned to one of two treatments: first PEG dose 8 ± 5 (mean ± SD) days before the expected calving date and a second dose within 24 h after calving (PEG) compared to untreated controls (Control). Treatment effects were evaluated with mixed linear regression models. Treatment with PEG increased WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts at 6 ± 1 (mean ± SD) days in milk. Parity, BCS and their interactions with treatment were not associated with WBC counts. In control cows, Pre-NEFA concentration was associated with reduced WBC, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and tended to be associated with reduced monocyte counts. Pegbovigrastim treatment reversed the negative association of Pre-NEFA concentration with neutrophil and monocyte counts and tended to reverse the negative association of Pre-NEFA concentration with WBC counts. In the PEG treated group, cows diagnosed with retained placenta or metritis showed lower neutrophil counts when compared to PEG treated cows without these clinical diseases. These data confirm that PEG treatment increases WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts in grazing dairy cows and that this effect is independent of parity. Pegbovigrastim treatment reversed the negative association of Pre-NEFA concentration with neutrophil and monocyte counts, and tended to reverse the negative association of Pre-NEFA concentration with WBC counts."
https://openalex.org/W3119186220,"Background &amp; aims Progranulin (PGRN) is known to promote tumorigenesis and proliferation of several types of cancer cells. However, little is known about the clinicopathological features of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) with regard to PGRN expression. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with GISTs who underwent curative surgical resection between 2007 and 2017. PGRN expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis and semi-quantitatively categorized (no expression, 0; weak, 1+; moderate, 2+; strong, 3+). Tumors with a staining intensity of 2+ or 3+ were considered high PGRN expression. Results Fifty-four patients were analyzed; 31 patients (57%) were male. The median age at surgery was 60 years (range, 33–79), and the most common primary site was the stomach (67%). Thirty-five patients (65%) had spindle histology; 42 patients (78%) were separated as a high-risk group according to the modified National Institutes of Health (NIH) classification. High PGRN-expressing tumors were observed in 27 patients (50%), had more epithelioid/mixed histology (68% vs. 32%; p = 0.046), and KIT exon 11 mutations (76% vs. 24%; p = 0.037). Patients with high PGRN-expressing tumors had a worse recurrence-free survival (RFS) (36% of 5-year RFS) compared to those with low PGRN-expressing tumors (96%; p &lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that high PGRN expression and old age (&gt;60 years) were independent prognostic factors for poor RFS. Conclusions High PGRN-expressing GISTs showed more epithelioid/mixed histology and KIT exon 11 mutations. PGRN overexpression was significantly associated with poor RFS in patients with GISTs who underwent curative resection."

We examined the current status of the results of cervical cytology conducted during pregnancy in Japan. We requested 2,293 obstetrical facilities to provide information on cervical cytology in pregnant women who delivered between October 2018 and March 2019. A total of 1,292 obstetrical facilities responded, with valid information on a total of 238,743 women. The implementation rate of cervical cytology during pregnancy was 86.8% in Japan. The prevalence of abnormal cervical cytology during pregnancy was 3.3% in total and 4.9% using a spatula/brush with liquid-based cytology (LBC). The prevalence of positive high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) in teenagers with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) was significantly higher than women of other ages (p < 0.01). Because HPV vaccine coverage has dropped to less than 1% in Japan, a further study with various conditions will be needed to improve the accuracy of cervical cancer screening during pregnancy."

In recent times, unhealthy outcomes from these systems have been highlighted including their vulnerability to amplifying small differences and offering less choice to readers. In this paper we present and study a new class of feedback models that exhibit a variety of self-organizing behaviors. In addition to showing important emergent properties, our model generalizes the popular “top-N news recommender systems” in a manner that provides media managers a mechanism to guide the emergent outcomes to mitigate potentially unhealthy outcomes driven by the self-organizing dynamics. We use complex adaptive systems framework to model the popularity evolution of news articles. In particular, we use agent-based simulation to model a reader’s behavior at the microscopic level and study the impact of various simulation hyperparameters on overall emergent phenomena. This simulation exercise enables us to show how the feedback model can be used as an alternative recommender to conventional top-N systems. Finally, we present a design framework for multi-objective evolutionary optimization that enables recommendation systems to co-evolve with the changing online news readership landscape."
https://openalex.org/W3118943980,"Objective Despite the high risk of missing lesions in mammography, the missed lesion rate is yet to be clinically established. Further, no breast phantoms with adjustable breast density currently exist. We developed a novel, adjustable-density breast phantom with a composition identical to that of actual breasts, and determined the quantitative relationship between breast density and the missed lesion rate in mammography. Methods An original breast phantom consisting of adipose- and fibroglandular-equivalent materials was developed, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study was performed. Breast density, which is the fraction by weight of fibroglandular to total tissue, was adjusted to 25%, 50%, and 75% by arbitrarily mixing the two materials. Microcalcification, mass lesions, and spiculated lesions, each with unique characteristics, were inserted into the phantom. For the above-mentioned fibroglandular densities, 50 positive and 50 negative images for each lesion type were used as case samples for the ROC study. Five certified radiological technologists participated in lesion detection. Results The mass-lesion detection rate, according to the area under the curve, decreased by 18.0% ( p = 0.0001, 95% Confidence intervals [CI] = 0.1258 to 0.1822) and 37.8% ( p = 0.0003, 95% CI = 0.2453 to 0.4031) for breast densities of 50% and 75%, respectively, compared to that for a 25% breast density. A similar tendency was observed with microcalcification; however, spiculated lesions did not follow this tendency. Conclusions We quantified the missed lesion rate in different densities of breast tissue using a novel breast phantom, which is imperative for advancing individualized screening mammography."
https://openalex.org/W3119620832,"IgA antibodies, which are secreted onto the mucosal surface as secretory IgA antibodies (SIgAs), play an important role in preventing influenza virus infection. A recent study reported that anti-hemagglutinin (HA) head-targeting antibodies increase anti-viral functions such as hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus neutralization (NT), in addition to HA binding activity (reactivity) via IgA polymerization. However, the functional properties of anti-viral IgA antibodies with mechanisms of action distinct from those of anti-HA head-targeting antibodies remain elusive. Here, we characterized the functional properties of IgG, monomeric IgA, and polymeric IgA anti-HA stalk-binding clones F11 and FI6, and B12 (a low affinity anti-HA stalk clone), as well as Fab-deficient (ΔFab) IgA antibodies. We found that IgA polymerization impacts the functional properties of anti-HA stalk antibodies. Unlike anti-HA head antibodies, the anti-viral functions of anti-HA stalk antibodies were not simply enhanced by IgA polymerization. The data suggest that two modes of binding (Fab paratope-mediated binding to the HA stalk, and IgA Fc glycan-mediated binding to the HA receptor binding site (RBS)) occur during interaction between anti-stalk HA IgA antibodies and HA. In situations where Fab paratope-mediated binding to the HA stalk exceeded IgA Fc glycan-mediated binding to HA RBS, IgA polymerization increased anti-viral functions. By contrast, when IgA Fc glycan-mediated binding to the HA RBS was dominant, anti-viral activity will fall upon IgA polymerization. In summary, the results suggest that coordination between these two independent binding modules determines whether IgA polymerization has a negative or positive effect on the anti-viral functions of anti-HA stalk IgA antibodies."

The objective of the study is to compare the effects of two evidence-based treatment options for adult patients with depression and advanced heart failure, on depressive symptom severity, physical and mental health related quality of life (HRQoL), heart-failure specific quality of life, caregiver burden, morbidity, and mortality at 3, 6 and 12-months. Methods Trial design. Pragmatic, randomized, comparative effectiveness trial. Interventions. The treatment interventions are: (1) Behavioral Activation (BA), a patient-centered psychotherapy which emphasizes engagement in enjoyable and valued personalized activities as selected by the patient; or (2) Antidepressant Medication Management administered using the collaborative care model (MEDS). Participants. Adults aged 18 and over with advanced heart failure (defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II, III, and IV) and depression (defined as a score of 10 or above on the PHQ-9 and confirmed by the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview for the DSM-5) selected from all patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center who are admitted with heart failure and all patients presenting to the outpatient programs of the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. We plan to randomize 416 patients to BA or MEDS, with an estimated 28% loss to follow-up/inability to collect follow-up data. Thus, we plan to include 150 in each group for a total of 300 participants from which data after randomization will be collected and analyzed. Conclusions The current trial is the first to compare the impact of BA and MEDS on depressive symptoms, quality of life, caregiver burden, morbidity, and mortality in patients with depression and advanced heart failure.

The study aims to develop and evaluate an educational intervention tailored to patients’ needs in order to increase the rate of patients’ adherence to physician's prescription for a sleep test. A multi-center, stratified, 2 parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial was conducted. The patients in the intervention group received the educational booklets on sleep apnea and sleep test which was designed based on the extracted factors through an in-depth interview with patients. All participants were contacted after two months to ask whether they completed an assessment for OSA. A total number of 1,650 individuals were screened. Finally, 104 participants were randomized to the control group (n = 50) or intervention group (n = 45) that did not differ significantly in baseline characteristics. The results of the intention to treat analysis indicate that patients in the intervention group were significantly more adherent to attend a sleep assessment for their OSA risk (30%; n = 15/50) than the patients in the control group (11.1%; n = 5/45, P &lt;0.05). Age, history of diabetes, and the educational intervention were effective in performing the sleep test. Time limitations, Condition improvement, and high cost of diagnostic test were the most barriers, respectively. The intervention was successful in improving the adherence rate of patients to prescribed sleep test. However, the adherence rate to sleep study testing is still far from desirable and requires more complex interventions."

https://openalex.org/W3118926152,"Data Integrity Auditing (DIA) is a security service for verifying the integrity of outsourced data in Public Cloud Storage (PCS) by users or by Third-Party Auditors (TPAs) on behalf of the users. This paper proposes a novel DIA framework, called DIA-MTTP. The major novelty of the framework lies in that, while providing the DIA service in a PCS environment, it supports the use of third parties, but does not require full trust in the third parties. In achieving this property, a number of ideas also have been embedded in the design. These ideas include the use of multiple third parties and a hierarchical approach to their communication structure making the service more suited to resource-constrained user devices, the provision of two integrity assurance levels to balance the trade-off between security protection levels and the costs incurred, the application of a data deduplication measure to both new data and existing data updates to minimise the number of tags (re-)generated. In supporting the dynamic data and deduplication measure, a distributed data structure, called Multiple Mapping Tables (M2T), is proposed. Security analysis indicates that our framework is secure with the use of untrusted third parties. Performance evaluation indicates that our framework imposes less computational, communication and storage overheads than related works."
