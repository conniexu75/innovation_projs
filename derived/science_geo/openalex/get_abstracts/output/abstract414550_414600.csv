https://openalex.org/W2152889673,"Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the relationship between NFTs and disease progression remains controversial. Analyses of tau animal models suggest that phenotypes coincide with accumulation of soluble aggregated tau species but not the accumulation of NFTs. The pathological role of prefilamentous tau aggregates, e.g., tau oligomeric intermediates, is poorly understood, in part because of methodological challenges. Here, we engineered a novel tau oligomer-specific antibody, T22, and used it to elucidate the temporal course and biochemical features of oligomers during NFT development in AD brain. We found that tau oligomers in human AD brain samples were 4-fold higher than those in the controls. We also revealed the role of oligomeric tau conformers in pretangles, neuritic plaques, and neuropil threads in the frontal cortex tissue from AD brains; this analysis uncovers a consistent code that governs tau oligomerization with regard to degree of neuronal cytopathology. These data are the first to characterize the role of tau oligomers in the natural history of NFTs, and they highlight the suitability of tau oligomers as therapeutic targets in AD and related tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2156416313,"Self-resolving inflammatory exudates and lipid mediator metabolomics recently uncovered a new family of potent anti-inflammatory and proresolving mediators biosynthesized by macrophages (MΦs), denoted maresins. Here we determined that maresin 1 (MaR1) produced by human MΦs from endogenous docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) matched synthetic 7R,14S-dihydroxydocosa-4Z,8E,10E,12Z,16Z,19Z-hexaenoic acid. The MaR1 alcohol groups and Z/E geometry of conjugated double bonds were matched using isomers prepared by total organic synthesis. MaR1's potent defining actions were confirmed with synthetic MaR1, i.e., limiting polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration in murine peritonitis (ng/mouse range) as well as enhancing human macrophage uptake of apoptotic PMNs. At 1 nM, MaR1 was slightly more potent than resolvin D1 in stimulating human MΦ efferocytosis, an action not shared by leukotriene B(4). MaR1 also accelerated surgical regeneration in planaria, increasing the rate of head reappearance. On injury of planaria, MaR1 was biosynthesized from deuterium-labeled (d(5))-DHA that was blocked with lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitor. MaR1 dose-dependently inhibited TRPV1 currents in neurons, blocked capsaicin (100 nM)-induced inward currents (IC(50) 0.49±0.02 nM), and reduced both inflammation- and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain in mice. These results demonstrate the potent actions of MaR1 in regulating inflammation resolution, tissue regeneration, and pain resolution. These findings suggest that chemical signals are shared in resolution cellular trafficking, a key process in tissue regeneration. Moreover, immunoresolvents of the innate immune response, such as MaR1, offer new opportunities for assessing MΦs and their local DHA metabolome in the return to tissue homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2162128823,"Large-scale structural genomics and genome-wide association studies generate a wealth of data relevant to human disease. Wang et al. interpret these data in the context of a protein interaction network, showing that systematic analyses of the structural interfaces hit by mutations yield insights into pathogenesis. To better understand the molecular mechanisms and genetic basis of human disease, we systematically examine relationships between 3,949 genes, 62,663 mutations and 3,453 associated disorders by generating a three-dimensional, structurally resolved human interactome. This network consists of 4,222 high-quality binary protein-protein interactions with their atomic-resolution interfaces. We find that in-frame mutations (missense point mutations and in-frame insertions and deletions) are enriched on the interaction interfaces of proteins associated with the corresponding disorders, and that the disease specificity for different mutations of the same gene can be explained by their location within an interface. We also predict 292 candidate genes for 694 unknown disease-to-gene associations with proposed molecular mechanism hypotheses. This work indicates that knowledge of how in-frame disease mutations alter specific interactions is critical to understanding pathogenesis. Structurally resolved interaction networks should be valuable tools for interpreting the wealth of data being generated by large-scale structural genomics and disease association studies."
https://openalex.org/W1985816651,"Cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs) occur as important innate immunity agents in many organisms, including humans, and offer a viable alternative to conventional antibiotics, as they physically disrupt the bacterial membranes, leading to membrane lysis and eventually cell death. In this work, we studied the biophysical and microbiological characteristics of designed CAPs varying in hydrophobicity levels and charge distributions by a variety of biophysical and biochemical approaches, including in-tandem atomic force microscopy, attenuated total reflection-FTIR, CD spectroscopy, and SDS-PAGE. Peptide structural properties were correlated with their membrane-disruptive abilities and antimicrobial activities. In bacterial lipid model membranes, a time-dependent increase in aggregated β-strand-type structure in CAPs with relatively high hydrophobicity (such as KKKKKKALFALWLAFLA-NH(2)) was essentially absent in CAPs with lower hydrophobicity (such as KKKKKKAAFAAWAAFAA-NH(2)). Redistribution of positive charges by placing three Lys residues at both termini while maintaining identical sequences minimized self-aggregation above the dimer level. Peptides containing four Leu residues were destructive to mammalian model membranes, whereas those with corresponding Ala residues were not. This finding was mirrored in hemolysis studies in human erythrocytes, where Ala-only peptides displayed virtually no hemolysis up to 320 μM, but the four-Leu peptides induced 40-80% hemolysis at the same concentration range. All peptides studied displayed strong antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (minimum inhibitory concentrations of 4-32 μM). The overall findings suggest optimum routes to balancing peptide hydrophobicity and charge distribution that allow efficient penetration and disruption of the bacterial membranes without damage to mammalian (host) membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2072524978,"Heterogeneity of embryological origins is a hallmark of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and may influence the development of vascular disease. Differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into developmental origin-specific SMC subtypes remains elusive. Here we describe a chemically defined protocol in which hPSCs were initially induced to form neuroectoderm, lateral plate mesoderm or paraxial mesoderm. These intermediate populations were further differentiated toward SMCs (>80% MYH11(+) and ACTA2(+)), which displayed contractile ability in response to vasoconstrictors and invested perivascular regions in vivo. Derived SMC subtypes recapitulated the unique proliferative and secretory responses to cytokines previously documented in studies using aortic SMCs of distinct origins. Notably, this system predicted increased extracellular matrix degradation by SMCs derived from lateral plate mesoderm, which was confirmed using rat aortic SMCs from corresponding origins. This differentiation approach will have broad applications in modeling origin-dependent disease susceptibility and in developing bioengineered vascular grafts for regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2009595390,"People with eating disorders (ED) frequently present with inflexible behaviours, including eating related issues which contribute to the maintenance of the illness. Small scale studies point to difficulties with cognitive set-shifting as a basis. Using larger scale studies will lend robustness to these data.542 participants were included in the dataset as follows: Anorexia Nervosa (AN) n = 171; Bulimia Nervosa (BN) n = 82; Recovered AN n = 90; Healthy controls (HC): n = 199. All completed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), an assessment that integrates multiple measurement of several executive processes concerned with problem solving and cognitive flexibility. The AN and BN groups performed poorly in most domains of the WCST. Recovered AN participants showed a better performance than currently ill participants; however, the number of preservative errors was higher than for HC participants.There is a growing interest in the diagnostic and treatment implications of cognitive flexibility in eating disorders. This large dataset supports previous smaller scale studies and a systematic review which indicate poor cognitive flexibility in people with ED."
https://openalex.org/W2010338855,"The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial program for the invasion and metastasis of epithelial tumors that involves loss of cell–cell adhesion and increased cell mobility; however, mechanisms underlying this transition are not fully elucidated. Here, we propose a novel mechanism through which the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 regulates EMT in prostate cancer cells through cooperation with the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1. We found that forced expression of SIRT1 in non-transformed PZ-HPV-7 prostate epithelial cells disrupts the epithelial morphology concomitant with decreased expression of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal markers. In contrast, silencing SIRT1 in metastatic prostate tumor cells restores cell–cell adhesion and induces a shift toward an epithelial morphology concomitant with increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers. We also found that SIRT1 has a physiologically relevant role in endogenous EMT induced by EGF signaling in prostate cancer cells. We propose that the regulation of EMT by SIRT1 involves modulation of, and cooperation with, the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1. Specifically, we show that SIRT1 silencing reduces expression of ZEB1 and that SIRT1 is recruited to the E-cadherin proximal promoter by ZEB1 to deacetylate histone H3 and to reduce binding of RNA polymerase II, ultimately suppressing E-cadherin transcription. We thus identify a necessary role for ZEB1 in SIRT1-mediated EMT. Finally, we show that reduction of SIRT1 decreases prostate cancer cell migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo in immunodeficient mice, which is largely independent of any general effects of SIRT1 on prostate cancer growth and survival. We therefore identify SIRT1 as a positive regulator of EMT and metastatic growth of prostate cancer cells and our findings implicate overexpressed SIRT1 as a potential therapeutic target to reverse EMT and to prevent prostate cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2095495271,"miRNAs are endogenously expressed 18- to 25-nucleotide RNAs that regulate gene expression through translational repression by binding to a target mRNA. Recently, it has been indicated that miRNAs are closely related to osteogenesis. Our previous data suggested that miR-30 family members might be important regulators during the biomineralization process. However, whether and how they modulate osteogenic differentiation have not been explored. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-30 family members negatively regulate BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation by targeting Smad1 and Runx2. Evidentially, overexpression of miR-30 family members led to a decrease of alkaline phosphatase activity, whereas knockdown of them increased the activity. Then bioinformatic analysis identified potential target sites of the miR-30 family located in the 3' untranslated regions of Smad1 and Runx2. Western blot analysis and quantitative RT-PCR assays demonstrated that miR-30 family members inhibit Smad1 gene expression on the basis of repressing its translation. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed that Smad1 is a direct target of miR-30 family members. Rescue experiments that overexpress Smad1 and Runx2 significantly eliminated the inhibitory effect of miR-30 on osteogenic differentiation and provided strong evidence that miR-30 mediates the inhibition of osteogenesis by targeting Smad1 and Runx2. Also, the inhibitory effects of the miR-30 family were validated in mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Therefore, our study uncovered that miR-30 family members are key negative regulators of BMP-2-mediated osteogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2068910226,"miR-124 is a brain-enriched microRNA that plays a crucial role in neural development and has been shown to be down-regulated in glioma and medulloblastoma, suggesting its possible involvement in brain tumor progression. Here, we show that miR-124 is down-regulated in a panel of different grades of glioma tissues and in all of the human glioma cell lines we examined. By integrated bioinformatics analysis and experimental confirmation, we identified SNAI2, which is often up-regulated in glioma, as a direct functional target of miR-124. Because SNAI2 has been shown to regulate stem cell functions, we examined the roles of miR-124 and SNAI2 in glioma cell stem-like traits. The results showed that overexpression of miR-124 and knockdown of SNAI2 reduced neurosphere formation, CD133(+) cell subpopulation, and stem cell marker (BMI1, Nanog, and Nestin) expression, and these effects could be rescued by re-expression of SNAI2. Furthermore, enhanced miR-124 expression significantly inhibited glioma cell invasion in vitro. Finally, stable overexpression of miR-124 and knockdown of SNAI2 inhibited the tumorigenicity and invasion of glioma cells in vivo. These findings reveal, for the first time, that the tumor suppressor activity of miR-124 could be partly due to its inhibitory effects on glioma stem-like traits and invasiveness through SNAI2."
https://openalex.org/W2009457709,"Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) represent a family of calcium sensor proteins that interact with a group of serine/threonine kinases designated as CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs). CBL-CIPK complexes are crucially involved in relaying plant responses to many environmental signals and in regulating ion fluxes. However, the biochemical characterization of CBL-CIPK complexes has so far been hampered by low activities of recombinant CIPKs. Here, we report on an efficient wheat germ extract-based in vitro transcription/translation protocol that yields active full-length wild-type CIPK proteins. We identified a conserved serine residue within the C terminus of CBLs as being phosphorylated by their interacting CIPKs. Remarkably, our studies revealed that CIPK-dependent CBL phosphorylation is strictly dependent on CBL-CIPK interaction via the CIPK NAF domain. The phosphorylation status of CBLs does not appear to influence the stability, localization, or CIPK interaction of these calcium sensor proteins in general. However, proper phosphorylation of CBL1 is absolutely required for the in vivo activation of the AKT1 K(+) channel by CBL1-CIPK23 and CBL9-CIPK23 complexes in oocytes. Moreover, we show that by combining CBL1, CIPK23, and AKT1, we can faithfully reconstitute CBL-dependent enhancement of phosphorylation of target proteins by CIPKs in vitro. In addition, we report that phosphorylation of CBL1 by CIPK23 is also required for the CBL1-dependent enhancement of CIPK23 activity toward its substrate. Together, these data identify a novel general regulatory mechanism of CBL-CIPK complexes in that CBL phosphorylation at their flexible C terminus likely provokes conformational changes that enhance specificity and activity of CBL-CIPK complexes toward their target proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1994604625,"We previously demonstrated that the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor2 (Nrf2), expressed abundantly in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, plays a pivotal role in the proliferation and chemoresistance of NSCLC. Here we show that Nrf2-mediated NSCLC cell proliferation is dually regulated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and an Nrf2 repressor protein Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1). NSCLC cells expressing wild-type EGFR and Keap1 genes show enhanced proliferation on stimulation with EGFR ligand under non-stress conditions. Exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) enhanced cell proliferation by modification of the Nrf2/Keap1 interaction. Although EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) inhibited the proliferation of these cells, exposure to CSE attenuated its efficacy. In NSCLC cells with Keap1 gene mutations, Nrf2 was constitutively activated owing to dysfunction of Keap1 and cells proliferated independently of EGFR signaling. Furthermore, EGFR-TKI was unable to inhibit their proliferation. In NSCLC cells with EGFR gene mutations, Nrf2 was constitutively activated by EGFR signaling. In these cells, proliferation was largely dependent on the EGFR signaling pathway. Although these cells were highly sensitive to EGFR-TKI, exposure to CSE or knockdown of Keap1 mRNA reduced sensitivity to EGFR-TKI. We found a case of NSCLC showing resistance to EGFR-TKI despite having EGFR-TKI-sensitive EGFR gene mutation because of dysfunctional mutation in Keap1 gene. Results indicate that oxidative stress reduces the anticancer effects of EGFR-TKI in wild-type Keap1 NSCLC cells. Analysis of Keap1 dysfunction may become a novel molecular marker to predict resistance to EGFR-TKI in NSCLC cells having EGFR-TKI-sensitive EGFR mutations. Finally, as the downstream molecule of both EGFR and Keap1 signaling, Nrf2 is an important molecular target for the treatment of NSCLC, where cells have mutations in EGFR, KRAS or Keap1 genes."
https://openalex.org/W2060175547,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors in the malignant progression of different tumor types. MiR-663 was recently reported to be decreased and identified as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. We also verified its role in repressing cell proliferation of a gastric cancer cell line. In this study, however, miR-663 was found to be upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells compared with human immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelium cells, using a miRNA microarray, and this higher expression was confirmed in NPC tissue samples. Indeed, inhibition of miR-663 impaired the proliferation of NPC cells in vitro and the NPC tumor growth of xenografts in nude mice. Mechanistically, miR-663 directly targeted p21WAF1/CIP1 to promote the cellular G1/S transition, as the inhibitory effects of miR-663 on the G1/S transition could be rescued by p21WAF1/CIP1 silencing. Our results imply that miR-663 may act as an oncogene in NPC. The newly identified miR-663/p21WAF1/CIP1 axis clarifies the molecular mechanism of NPC cell proliferation and represents a novel strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2094739779,"To survive within its host erythrocyte, Plasmodium falciparum must export hundreds of proteins across both its parasite plasma membrane and surrounding parasitophorous vacuole membrane, most of which are likely to use a protein complex known as PTEX (Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins). PTEX is a putative protein trafficking machinery responsible for the export of hundreds of proteins across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and into the human host cell. Five proteins are known to comprise the PTEX complex, and in this study, three of the major stoichiometric components are investigated including HSP101 (a AAA(+) ATPase), a protein of no known function termed PTEX150, and the apparent membrane component EXP2. We show that these proteins are synthesized in the preceding schizont stage (PTEX150 and HSP101) or even earlier in the life cycle (EXP2), and before invasion these components reside within the dense granules of invasive merozoites. From these apical organelles, the protein complex is released into the host cell where it resides with little turnover in the parasitophorous vacuole membrane for most of the remainder of the following cell cycle. At this membrane, PTEX is arranged in a stable macromolecular complex of >1230 kDa that includes an ∼600-kDa apparently homo-oligomeric complex of EXP2 that can be separated from the remainder of the PTEX complex using non-ionic detergents. Two different biochemical methods undertaken here suggest that PTEX components associate as EXP2-PTEX150-HSP101, with EXP2 associating with the vacuolar membrane. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that EXP2 oligomerizes and potentially forms the putative membrane-spanning pore to which the remainder of the PTEX complex is attached."
https://openalex.org/W1985884010,"Papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins associate with LXXLL motifs on target cellular proteins to alter their function. Using a proteomic approach, we found the E6 oncoproteins of cutaneous papillomaviruses Bovine Papillomavirus Type 1 (BPV-1) E6 and human papillomavirus (HPV) types 1 and 8 (1E6 and 8E6) associated with the MAML1 transcriptional co-activator. All three E6 proteins bind to an acidic LXXLL motif at the carboxy-terminus of MAML1 and repress transactivation by MAML1. MAML1 is best known as the co-activator and effector of NOTCH-induced transcription, and BPV-1 E6 represses synthetic NOTCH-responsive promoters, endogenous NOTCH-responsive promoters, and is found in a complex with MAML1 in stably transformed cells. BPV-1-induced papillomas show characteristics of repressed NOTCH signal transduction, including suprabasal expression of integrins, talin and basal type keratins, and delayed expression of the NOTCH-dependent HES1 transcription factor. These observations give rise to a model whereby papillomavirus oncoproteins, including BPV-1 E6, and the cancer-associated HPV-8 E6 repress NOTCH-induced transcription, thereby delaying keratinocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2155631579,"Liver toxicity is one of the most common reasons for abandoning new drugs in development or withdrawing approved drugs from the market. Patel et al. show that in mice drug-induced liver injury can be limited by small-molecule inhibitor of the gap-junctional protein connexin 32. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) limits the development and application of many therapeutic compounds and presents major challenges to the pharmaceutical industry and clinical medicine1,2. Acetaminophen-containing compounds are among the most frequently prescribed drugs and are also the most common cause of DILI3. Here we describe a pharmacological strategy that targets gap junction communication to prevent amplification of fulminant hepatic failure and acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. We demonstrate that connexin 32 (Cx32), a key hepatic gap junction protein, is an essential mediator of DILI by showing that mice deficient in Cx32 are protected against liver damage, acute inflammation and death caused by liver-toxic drugs. We identify a small-molecule inhibitor of Cx32 that protects against liver failure and death in wild-type mice when co-administered with known hepatotoxic drugs. These findings indicate that gap junction inhibition could provide a pharmaceutical strategy to limit DILI and improve drug safety."
https://openalex.org/W2041816980,"Uncovering the mechanisms that govern the maintenance of stem-like cancer cells is critical for developing therapeutic strategies for targeting these cells. Constitutive activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has been reported in gliomas and correlates with histological grade. Here, we found that JNK signaling is crucial for the maintenance of ‘stemness’ in glioma cells. Sphere-cultured glioma cells showed more phosphorylation of JNK compared with serum-containing monolayer cultures. Importantly, blockade of JNK signaling with SP600125 or small interfering RNAs targeting JNK1 or JNK2 significantly reduced the CD133+/Nestin+ population and suppressed sphere formation, colony formation in soft agar, and expression of stem cell markers in sphere-cultured glioma cells. Intriguingly, sphere-cultured glioma cells exhibited enhanced expression of Notch-2, but not Notch-1, -3 or -4, and JNK inhibition almost completely abrogated this increase. Blocking the phosphoinoside 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway with LY294002 or si-Akt also suppressed the self-renewal of sphere-cultured glioma cells. PI3K, but not Akt, had a role as an upstream kinase in JNK1/2 activation. In addition, treatment with si-JNK greatly increased etoposide- and ionizing radiation (IR)-induced cell death in glioma spheres. Consistent with glioma cell lines, glioma stem-like cells isolated from primary patient glioma cells also had a higher activity of JNK and Notch-2 expression. Importantly, inhibition of JNK2 led to a decrease of Notch-2 expression and suppressed the CD133+/Nestin+ cell population in patient-derived primary glioma cells. Finally, downregulation of JNK2 almost completely suppressed intracranial tumor formation by glioma cells in nude mice. Taken together, these data demonstrate that JNK signaling is crucial for the maintenance of self-renewal and tumorigenicity of glioma stem-like cells and drug/IR resistance, and can be considered a promising target for eliminating stem-like cancer cells in gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2013960132,"Aberrant glutamate and calcium signalings are neurotoxic to specific neuronal populations. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase in neurons, is believed to regulate neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in response to calcium signaling produced by neuronal activity. Importantly, several CaMKII substrates control neuronal structure, excitability, and plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that CaMKII inhibition for >4 h using small molecule and peptide inhibitors induces apoptosis in cultured cortical neurons. The neuronal death produced by prolonged CaMKII inhibition is associated with an increase in TUNEL staining and caspase-3 cleavage and is blocked with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. Thus, this neurotoxicity is consistent with apoptotic mechanisms, a conclusion that is further supported by dysregulated calcium signaling with CaMKII inhibition. CaMKII inhibitory peptides also enhance the number of action potentials generated by a ramp depolarization, suggesting increased neuronal excitability with a loss of CaMKII activity. Extracellular glutamate concentrations are augmented with prolonged inhibition of CaMKII. Enzymatic buffering of extracellular glutamate and antagonism of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors prevent the calcium dysregulation and neurotoxicity associated with prolonged CaMKII inhibition. However, in the absence of CaMKII inhibition, elevated glutamate levels do not induce neurotoxicity, suggesting that a combination of CaMKII inhibition and elevated extracellular glutamate levels results in neuronal death. In sum, the loss of CaMKII observed with multiple pathological states in the central nervous system, including epilepsy, brain trauma, and ischemia, likely exacerbates programmed cell death by sensitizing vulnerable neuronal populations to excitotoxic glutamate signaling and inducing an excitotoxic insult itself."
https://openalex.org/W2032791659,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a critical human tumor-suppressor complex. A recently characterized PP2A inhibitor protein, namely cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), has been found to be overexpressed at a high frequency in most of the human cancer types. However, our understanding of gene expression programs regulated by CIP2A is almost absent. Moreover, clinical relevance of the CIP2A-regulated transcriptome has not been addressed thus far. Here, we report a high-confidence transcriptional signature regulated by CIP2A. Bioinformatic pathway analysis of the CIP2A signature revealed that CIP2A regulates several MYC-dependent and MYC-independent gene programs. With regard to MYC-independent signaling, JNK2 expression and transwell migration were inhibited by CIP2A depletion, whereas MYC depletion did not affect either of these phenotypes. Instead, depletion of either CIP2A or MYC inhibited cancer cell colony growth with statistically indistinguishable efficiency. Moreover, CIP2A depletion was shown to regulate the expression of several established MYC target genes, out of which most were MYC-repressed genes. CIP2A small-interfering RNA-elicited inhibition of colony growth or activation of MYC-repressed genes was reversed at large by concomitant PP2A inhibition. Finally, the CIP2A signature was shown to cluster with basal-type and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer signatures. Accordingly, CIP2A protein expression was significantly associated with basal-like (P=0.0014) and HER2+ (P<0.0001) breast cancers. CIP2A expression also associated with MYC gene amplification (P<0.001). Taken together, identification of CIP2A-driven transcriptional signature, and especially novel MYC-independent signaling programs regulated by CIP2A, provides important resource for understanding CIP2A's role as a clinically relevant human oncoprotein. With regard to MYC, these results both validate CIP2A's role in regulating MYC-mediated gene expression and provide a plausible novel explanation for the high MYC activity in basal-like and HER2+ breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2122629451,"microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as regulators of a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental processes, including brain morphogenesis, neuronal differentiation, and survival. While the role of miRNAs in establishing and maintaining the developing nervous system is widely appreciated, the developmental neurobehavioral role of miRNAs has yet to be defined. Here we show that transient disruption of brain morphogenesis by ethanol exposure results in behavioral hyperactivity in larval zebrafish challenged with changes in lighting conditions. Aberrations in swimming activity persist in juveniles that were developmentally exposed to ethanol. During early neurogenesis, multiple gene expression profiling studies revealed widespread changes in mRNA and miRNA abundance in ethanol-exposed embryos. Consistent with a role for miRNAs in neurobehavioral development, target prediction analyses identified multiple miRNAs misexpressed in the ethanol-exposed cohorts that were also predicted to target inversely expressed transcripts known to influence brain morphogenesis. In vivo knockdown of miR-9/9∗ or miR-153c persistently phenocopied the effect of ethanol on larval and juvenile swimming behavior. Structural analyses performed on adults showed that repression of miR-153c during development impacts craniofacial skeletal development. Together, these data support an integral role for miRNAs in the establishment of vertebrate neurobehavioral and skeletal systems.—Tal, T. L., Franzosa, J. A., Tilton, S. C., Philbrick, K.

https://openalex.org/W2063027940,"Human cancers often contain genetic alterations that disable G1/S checkpoint control and loss of this checkpoint is thought to critically contribute to cancer generation by permitting inappropriate proliferation and distorting fate-driven cell cycle exit. The identification of cell permeable small molecules that activate the G1/S checkpoint may therefore represent a broadly applicable and clinically effective strategy for the treatment of cancer. Here we describe the identification of several novel small molecules that trigger G1/S checkpoint activation and characterise the mechanism of action for one, CCT020312, in detail. Transcriptional profiling by cDNA microarray combined with reverse genetics revealed phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alpha (EIF2A) through the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 3 (EIF2AK3/PERK) as the mechanism of action of this compound. While EIF2AK3/PERK activation classically follows endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signalling that sets off a range of different cellular responses, CCT020312 does not trigger these other cellular responses but instead selectively elicits EIF2AK3/PERK signalling. Phosphorylation of EIF2A by EIF2A kinases is a known means to block protein translation and hence restriction point transit in G1, but further supports apoptosis in specific contexts. Significantly, EIF2AK3/PERK signalling has previously been linked to the resistance of cancer cells to multiple anticancer chemotherapeutic agents, including drugs that target the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and taxanes. Consistent with such findings CCT020312 sensitizes cancer cells with defective taxane-induced EIF2A phosphorylation to paclitaxel treatment. Our work therefore identifies CCT020312 as a novel small molecule chemical tool for the selective activation of EIF2A-mediated translation control with utility for proof-of-concept applications in EIF2A-centered therapeutic approaches, and as a chemical starting point for pathway selective agent development. We demonstrate that consistent with its mode of action CCT020312 is capable of delivering potent, and EIF2AK3 selective, proliferation control and can act as a sensitizer to chemotherapy-associated stresses as elicited by taxanes."
https://openalex.org/W2166876728,"Loss of tumour suppressor gene function can occur as a result of epigenetic silencing of large chromosomal regions, referred to as long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES), and genome-wide analyses have revealed that LRES is present in many cancer types. Here we utilize Illumina Beadchip methylation array analysis to identify LRES across 800 kb of chromosome 5q31 in colorectal adenomas and carcinomas (n=34) relative to normal colonic epithelial DNA (n=6). This region encompasses 53 individual protocadherin (PCDH) genes divided among three gene clusters. Hypermethylation within these gene clusters is asynchronous; while most PCDH hypermethylation occurs early, and is apparent in adenomas, PCDHGC3 promoter methylation occurs later in the adenoma–carcinoma transition. PCDHGC3 was hypermethylated in 17/28 carcinomas (60.7%) according to methylation array analysis. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction showed that PCDHGC3 is the highest expressed PCDH in normal colonic epithelium, and that there was a strong reciprocal relationship between PCDHGC3 methylation and expression in carcinomas (R=−0.84). PCDH LRES patterns are reflected in colorectal tumour cell lines; adenoma cell lines are not methylated at PCDHGC3 and show abundant expression at the mRNA and protein level, while the expression is suppressed in hypermethylated carcinoma cell lines (R=−0.73). Short-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of PCDHGC3 led to a decrease of apoptosis in RG/C2 adenoma cells, and overexpression of PCDHGC3 in HCT116 cells resulted in the reduction of colony formation, consistent with tumour suppressor capabilities for PCDHGC3. Further functional analysis showed that PCDHGC3 can suppress Wnt and mammalian target of rapamycin signalling in colorectal cancer cell lines. Taken together, our data suggest that the PCDH LRES is an important tumour suppressor locus in colorectal cancer, and that PCDHGC3 may be a strong marker and driver for the adenoma–carcinoma transition."

Luciferase reporter assays confirmed direct binding of miR-29b to the ID1 3′-UTR. Expression of miR-29b suppressed ID1 levels and significantly reduced migration and invasion. Expression of antisense-miR-29b (anti-miR-29b), on the other hand, enhanced ID1 mRNA and protein levels, and significantly increased lung cancer cell migration and invasion, a hallmark of the Src-ID1 pathway. The ectopic expression of ID1 in miR-29b-overexpressing cells was able to rescue the migratory potential of these cells. Both, anti-miR-29b and ID1 overexpression diminished the effects of the Src inhibitors saracatinib and dasatinib on migration and invasion. Saracatinib and dasatinib decreased c-Myc transcriptional repression on miR-29b and led to increased ID1 protein levels, whereas forced expression of c-Myc repressed miR-29b and induced ID1. In agreement, we showed direct recruitment of c-Myc to the miR-29b promoter. miR-29b was significantly downregulated in primary lung adenocarcinoma samples compared with matched alveolar lung tissue, and miR-29b expression was a significant prognostic factor for patient outcome. These results suggest that miR-29b is involved in the Src-ID1 signaling pathway, is dysregulated in lung adenocarcinoma and is a potential predictive marker for Src kinase inhibitors."

Methodology/Findings We recruited 210 drug users in Shanwei city, Guangdong province. Among them, HCV RNA was detected in 150 (71.4%), both E1 and NS5B genes were sequenced in 136, and 6a genotyped in 70. Of the 6a sequences, most were grouped into three clusters while 23% represent emerging strains. For coalescent analysis, additional 6a sequences were determined among 21 blood donors from Vietnam, 22 donors from 12 provinces of China, and 36 IDUs from Liuzhou City in Guangxi Province. Phylogeographic analyses indicated that Vietnam could be the origin of 6a in China. The Guangxi Province, which borders Vietnam, could be the first region to accept 6a for circulation. Migration from Yunnan, which also borders Vietnam, might be equally important, but it was only detected among IDUs in limited regions. From Guangxi, 6a could have further spread to Guangdong, Yunnan, Hainan, and Hubei provinces. However, evidence showed that only in Guangdong has 6a become a local epidemic, making Guangdong the second source region to disseminate 6a to the other 12 provinces. With a rate of 2.737×10−3 (95% CI: 1.792×10−3 to 3.745×10−3), a Bayesian Skyline Plot was portrayed. It revealed an exponential 6a growth during 1994–1998, while before and after 1994–1998 slow 6a growths were maintained. Concurrently, 1994–1998 corresponded to a period when contaminated blood transfusion was common, which caused many people being infected with HIV and HCV, until the Chinese government outlawed the use of paid blood donations in 1998. Conclusions/Significance With an origin from Vietnam, 6a has become a local epidemic in Guangdong Province, where an increasing prevalence has subsequently led to 6a spread to many other regions of China."
https://openalex.org/W1990120691,"Mammalian cells maintain iron homeostasis by sensing changes in bioavailable iron levels and promoting adaptive responses. FBXL5 is a subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates the stability of iron regulatory protein 2, an important posttranscriptional regulator of several genes involved in iron metabolism. The stability of FBXL5 is regulated in an iron- and oxygen-responsive manner, contingent upon the presence of its N-terminal domain. Here we present the atomic structure of the FBXL5 N terminus, a hemerythrin-like α-helical bundle fold not previously observed in mammalian proteins. The core of this domain employs an unusual assortment of amino acids necessary for the assembly and sensing properties of its diiron center. These regulatory features govern the accessibility of a mapped sequence required for proteasomal degradation of FBXL5. Detailed molecular and structural characterization of the ligand-responsive hemerythrin domain provides insights into the mechanisms by which FBXL5 serves as a unique mammalian metabolic sensor."

https://openalex.org/W2120822929,"Repair of injury to the plasma membrane is an essential mechanism for maintenance of cellular homeostasis and integrity that involves coordinated movement of intracellular vesicles to membrane injury sites to facilitate patch formation. We have previously identified MG53 as an essential component of the cell membrane repair machinery. In order for MG53 and intracellular vesicles to translocate to membrane injury sites, motor proteins must be involved. Here, we show that nonmuscle myosin type IIA (NM-IIA) interacts with MG53 to regulate vesicle trafficking during cell membrane repair. In cells that are deficient for NM-IIA expression, MG53 cannot translocate to acute injury sites, whereas rescue of NM-IIA expression in these cells can restore MG53-mediated membrane repair. Compromised cell membrane repair is observed in cells with RNAi-mediated knockdown of NM-IIA expression, or following pharmacological alteration of NM-IIA motor function. Together, our data reveal NM-IIA as a key cytoskeleton motor protein that facilitates vesicle trafficking during MG53-mediated cell membrane repair."
https://openalex.org/W1968746707,"Background Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a pathogen of worldwide significance to the poultry industry. IBDV has a bi-segmented double-stranded RNA genome. Segments A and B encode the capsid, ribonucleoprotein and non-structural proteins, or the virus polymerase (RdRp), respectively. Since the late eighties, very virulent (vv) IBDV strains have emerged in Europe inducing up to 60% mortality. Although some progress has been made in understanding the molecular biology of IBDV, the molecular basis for the pathogenicity of vvIBDV is still not fully understood. Methodology, Principal Findings Strain 88180 belongs to a lineage of pathogenic IBDV phylogenetically related to vvIBDV. By reverse genetics, we rescued a molecular clone (mc88180), as pathogenic as its parent strain. To study the molecular basis for 88180 pathogenicity, we constructed and characterized in vivo reassortant or mosaic recombinant viruses derived from the 88180 and the attenuated Cu-1 IBDV strains. The reassortant virus rescued from segments A of 88180 (A88) and B of Cu-1 (BCU1) was milder than mc88180 showing that segment B is involved in 88180 pathogenicity. Next, the exchange of different regions of BCU1 with their counterparts in B88 in association with A88 did not fully restore a virulence equivalent to mc88180. This demonstrated that several regions if not the whole B88 are essential for the in vivo pathogenicity of 88180. Conclusion, Significance The present results show that different domains of the RdRp, are essential for the in vivo pathogenicity of IBDV, independently of the replication efficiency of the mosaic viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2159373976,"The functional adaptation of the immune system to the surrounding environment is also a fundamental issue in space. It has been suggested that a decreased number of lymphocytes might be a cause of immunosuppression, possibly due to the induction of apoptosis. Early activation of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) might play a central role in the initiation of the apoptotic program. The goal of the role of apoptosis in lymphocyte depression (ROALD) experiment, flown on the International Space Station as part of the BIO-4 mission of the European Space Agency, was to ascertain the induction of apoptosis in human lymphocytes under authentic microgravity, and to elucidate the possible involvement of 5-LOX. Our results demonstrate that exposure of human lymphocytes to microgravity for 48 h onboard the ISS remarkably increased apoptotic hallmarks such as DNA fragmentation (~3-fold compared to ground-based controls) and cleaved-poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein expression (~3-fold), as well as mRNA levels of apoptosis-related markers such as p53 (~3-fold) and calpain (~4-fold); these changes were paralleled by an early increase of 5-LOX activity (~2-fold). Our findings provide a molecular background for the immune dysfunction observed in astronauts during space missions, and reveal potential new markers to monitor health status of ISS crew members.—Battista, N., Meloni, M.

https://openalex.org/W2015926937,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) was originally identified from a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas carrying t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation, where ALK was constitutively activated as a result of a fusion with nucleophosmin (NPM). Aberrant ALK fusion proteins were also generated in inflammatory fibrosarcoma and a subset of non-small-cell lung cancers, and these proteins are implicated in their pathogenesis. Recently, ALK has been demonstrated to be constitutively activated by gene mutations and/or amplifications in sporadic as well as familial cases of neuroblastoma. Here we describe another mechanism of aberrant ALK activation observed in a neuroblastoma-derived cell line (NB-1), in which a short-form ALK protein (ALKdel2-3) having a truncated extracellular domain is overexpressed because of amplification of an abnormal ALK gene that lacks exons 2 and 3. ALKdel2-3 was autophosphorylated in NB-1 cells as well as in ALKdel2-3-transduced cells and exhibited enhanced in vitro kinase activity compared with the wild-type kinase. ALKdel2-3-transduced NIH3T3 cells exhibited increased colony-forming capacity in soft agar and tumorigenicity in nude mice. RNAi-mediated ALK knockdown resulted in the growth suppression of ALKdel2-3-expressing cells, arguing for the oncogenic role of this mutant. Our findings provide a novel insight into the mechanism of deregulation of the ALK kinase and its roles in neuroblastoma pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2063770526,"The Notch pathway is an evolutionary conserved signaling cascade that has an essential role in melanoblast and melanocyte stem cell homeostasis. Notch signaling is emerging as a key player in melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. In melanoma, Notch1 is inappropriately reactivated and contributes to melanoma tumorigenicity. Here, we propose a novel mechanism by which Notch1 promotes the disease. We found that Notch1 directly regulates the transcription of neuregulin1 (NRG1) by binding to its promoter region. NRG1 is the ligand for ERBB3 and 4, members of the epidermal growth factor family of receptors that are involved in the genesis and progression of a number of cancers. Notch1 and NRG1 expression are associated in melanoma and inhibition of NRG1 signaling leads to melanoma cell growth inhibition and tumor growth delay. Mechanistically, these effects are associated with the inhibition of the PI3Kinase/Akt signaling pathway and with the accumulation of p27(Kip1). On the other end, addition of recombinant NRG1 can partially restore melanoma cell growth that is inhibited by Notch1 ablation. Taken together, our findings underline a new, previously undescribed autocrine signaling loop between Notch1 and NRG1 that controls melanoma growth and provide experimental evidence that the targeting of Notch and ERBB signaling may represent a novel potential therapeutic approach in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1974864882,"Deregulation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a hallmark of major gastrointestinal cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The oncogenic role of β-catenin is well defined but reasons for its accumulation in HCC remain unclear. Dickkopf 4 (DKK4) acts as a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin pathway but its functional role in liver carcinogenesis has not been studied. We investigated the role of DKK4 in β-catenin regulation in HCC. Reduced expression of DKK4 was found in 47% (38/81) of HCC, as measured by quantitative real time PCR. Ectopic expression of DKK4 in two HCC cell lines, PLC/PRF/5 (PLC) and MHCC97L (97L), attenuated β-catenin responsive luciferase activity, and decreased both β-catenin and cyclin D1 protein levels. To study the effect of DKK4 on cell growth and tumourigenicity, two stable HCC cell lines were established from PLC and 97L cells. Functional assays demonstrated that overexpression of DKK4 hampered cell proliferation, reduced colony formation and retarded cell migration. When DKK4-expressing 97L stable cells were used to induce tumour xenografts in nude mice (n=8), reduction in tumour sizes was observed (P=0.027). Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies showed that decreased expression of DKK4 was associated with β-catenin accumulation in HCC tissues. Additionally, inhibition of the proteasome using specific inhibitor in DKK4-expressing 97L stable cells masked the effect of β-catenin. Our findings suggest a potential tumour suppressive role of DKK4 as well as that of an important regulator of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2069824527,"Trastuzumab (Herceptin) resistance is a major obstacle in the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancers. We recently reported that the transcription factor Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) leads to acquisition of resistance to trastuzumab in a phosphorylation-dependent manner that relies on p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). To explore how this may occur we compared YB-1 target genes between trastuzumab-sensitive cells (BT474) and those with acquired resistance (HR5 and HR6) using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-sequencing), which identified 1391 genes uniquely bound by YB-1 in the resistant cell lines. We then examined differences in protein expression and phosphorylation between these cell lines using the Kinexus Kinex antibody microarrays. Cross-referencing these two data sets identified the mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinase (MNK) family as potentially being involved in acquired resistance downstream from YB-1. MNK1 and MNK2 were subsequently shown to be overexpressed in the resistant cell lines; however, only the former was a YB-1 target based on ChIP-PCR and small interfering RNA (siRNA) studies. Importantly, loss of MNK1 expression using siRNA enhanced sensitivity to trastuzumab. Further, MNK1 overexpression was sufficient to confer resistance to trastuzumab in cells that were previously sensitive. We then developed a de novo model of acquired resistance by exposing BT474 cells to trastuzumab for 60 days (BT474LT). Similar to the HR5/HR6 cells, the BT474LT cells had elevated MNK1 levels and were dependent on it for survival. In addition, we demonstrated that RSK phosphorylated MNK1, and that this phosphorylation was required for ability of MNK1 to mediate resistance to trastuzumab. Furthermore, inhibition of RSK with the small molecule BI-D1870 repressed the MNK1-mediated trastuzumab resistance. In conclusion, this unbiased integrated approach identified MNK1 as a player in mediating trastuzumab resistance as a consequence of YB-1 activation, and demonstrated RSK inhibition as a means to overcome recalcitrance to trastuzumab."

Consistent with this observation, pharmacological inhibitors of PI4KB blocked entry of SARS pseudovirions. Further research suggested that PI4P plays an essential role in SARS-CoV spike-mediated entry, which is regulated by the PI4P lipid microenvironment.

https://openalex.org/W2141151479,"Linker histone H1.2 has been shown to suppress p53-dependent transcription through the modulation of chromatin remodeling; however, little is known about the mechanisms governing the antagonistic effects of H1.2 in DNA damage response. Here, we show that the repressive action of H1.2 on p53 function is negatively regulated via acetylation of p53 C-terminal regulatory domain and phosphorylation of H1.2 C-terminal tail. p53 acetylation by p300 impairs the interaction of p53 with H1.2 and triggers a rapid activation of p53-dependent transcription. Similarly, DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of H1.2 at T146 enhances p53 transcriptional activity by impeding H1.2 binding to p53 and thereby attenuating its suppressive effects on p53 transactivation. Consistent with these findings, point mutations mimicking modification states of H1.2 and p53 lead to a significant increase in p53-induced apoptosis. These data suggest that p53 acetylation-H1.2 phosphorylation cascade serves as a unique mechanism for triggering p53-dependent DNA damage response pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2125210550,"α-Actinins are actin-binding proteins that can be broadly divided into Ca2+-sensitive cytoskeletal and Ca2+-insensitive sarcomeric isoforms. To date, little is known about functional differences between the isoforms due to their indistinguishable activities in most in vitro assays. To identify functional differences in vivo between sarcomeric isoforms, we employed computational and molecular approaches to characterize the zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome, which contains orthologoues of each human α-actinin gene, including duplicated copies of actn3. Each isoform exhibits a distinct and unique pattern of gene expression as assessed by mRNA in situ hybridization, largely sharing similar expression profiles as seen in humans. The spatial conservation of expression of these genes from lower invertebrates to humans suggests that regulation and subsequent functions of these genes are conserved during evolution. Morpholino-based knockdown of the sarcomeric isoform, actn2, leads to skeletal muscle, cardiac, and ocular defects evident over the first week of development. Remarkably, despite the high degree of sequence conservation between actn2 and actn3, the phenotypes of α-actinin-2 deficient zebrafish can be rescued by overexpression of α-actinin-2 but not by α-actinin-3 mRNAs from zebrafish or human. These data provide functional evidence that the primary sequences of α-actinin-2 and α-actinin-3 evolved differences to optimize their functions.—Gupta, V., Discenza, M., Guyon, J. R., Kunkel, L.

Developing small molecules that disrupt formation of early oligomeric states of Aβ and thereby reduce the effective amount of toxic oligomers is a promising therapeutic strategy for AD. Here, mass spectrometry and ion mobility spectrometry were used to investigate the effects of a small molecule, Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone (PADK), on the Aβ42 form of the protein. The mass spectrum of a mixture of PADK and Aβ42 clearly shows that PADK binds directly to Aβ42 monomers and small oligomers. Ion mobility results indicate that PADK not only inhibits the formation of Aβ42 dodecamers, but also removes preformed Aβ42 dodecamers from the solution. Electron microscopy images show that PADK inhibits Aβ42 fibril formation in the solution. These results are consistent with a previous study that found that PADK has protective effects in an AD transgenic mouse model. The study of PADK and Aβ42 provides an example of small molecule therapeutic development for AD and other amyloid diseases."

We explored the role of a Regulator of G-protein Signaling protein (RGS4) in the ASM hyperplasia and reduced contractile capacity characteristic of advanced asthma. Using immunocytochemical staining, ASM expression of RGS4 was determined in endobronchial biopsies from healthy subjects and those from subjects with mild, moderate and severe asthma. Cell proliferation assays, agonist-induced calcium mobilization and bronchoconstriction were determined in cultured human ASM cells and in human precision cut lung slices. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, the precise role of RGS proteins was determined in stimulating human ASM proliferation and inhibiting bronchoconstriction. RGS4 expression was restricted to a subpopulation of ASM and was specifically upregulated by mitogens, which induced a hyperproliferative and hypocontractile ASM phenotype similar to that observed in recalcitrant asthma. RGS4 expression was markedly increased in bronchial smooth muscle of patients with severe asthma, and expression correlated significantly with reduced pulmonary function. Whereas RGS4 inhibited G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated bronchoconstriction, unexpectedly RGS4 was required for PDGF-induced proliferation and sustained activation of PI3K, a mitogenic signaling molecule that regulates ASM proliferation. These studies indicate that increased RGS4 expression promotes a phenotypic switch of ASM, evoking irreversible airway obstruction in subjects with severe asthma."

Cytotoxicity afforded after staurosporine treatment is comparable with that obtained in SH-SY5Y cells, which exhibit a complete apoptotic phenotype. SK-N-AS cell death is a caspase-dependent process that can be impaired by the pan-caspase inhibitor q-VD-OPh.

Therefore, the functional consequences of ICAD deficiency (absence of apoptotic DNA fragmentation) have been attributed to the lack of CAD synthesis. Upon apoptotic insult, DFF40/CAD needs to be located in the nucleus to degrade the chromatin. It has been described that ICAD-CAD complex is found either in the cytosol (10.Enari M. Sakahira H.

In this work we show that DFF40/CAD protein can be detected in both the cytosolic and the nuclear subcellular compartments of resting cells. However, the levels of the endonuclease in each subcellular compartment are indeed a cell-specific feature. In this sense we have detected that in cells displaying oligonucleosomal DNA degradation upon staurosporine treatment (SH-SY5Y cells), the endonuclease is located in both cytosol and nuclei. However, when DFF40/CAD is not enriched in the cytosolic fraction, cells are defective in the generation of DNA laddering (SK-N-AS cells). To carry out its endonuclease function, DFF40/CAD needs to be located in the same fraction where ICAD is preferentially processed, the cytosolic fraction. Increasing the cytosolic levels of DFF40/CAD in SK-N-AS cells by overexpression of its own endonuclease restores the ability to degrade DNA into LMW fragments. Altogether, our results indicate that despite DFF40/CAD nuclear localization, resting cells require a pool in the cytosol to achieve LMW DNA degradation upon apoptotic insult.

Medium was routinely changed every 3 days. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a saturating humidity atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. For the different experiments, cells were grown at the adequate cell densities in culture dishes or multiwell plates (BD Biosciences) using the same culture conditions as described above. Some neuroblastoma cell lines employed in this work were generous gifts from Dr. M. Esteller and Dr. M. Berdasco (Institut d'Investigació Biomèdica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain). Trypan blue assays and nuclear morphology by Hoechst 33258 staining were performed as previously established in our laboratory (23.Gozzelino R. Sole C. Llecha N. Segura M.F. Moubarak R.S.

The cell nuclei were visualized with a Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000-E microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics under UV illumination and a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER photographic camera. Uniformly stained nuclei were scored as stage I (partial chromatin condensation in the absence of karyorrhexis) or stage II (nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis) morphology. Oligonucleosomal DNA degradation analysis was carried out as previously described (24.Ribas J. Yuste V.J. Garrofé-Ochoa X. Meijer L. Esquerda J.E. Boix J. 7-Bromoindirubin-3′-oxime uncovers a serine protease-mediated paradigm of necrotic cell death.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2008; 76: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Extracted DNA was analyzed in 1.8% agarose gel in 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6, stained in 0.5 μg/ml of ethidium bromide, and then visualized using a Syngene Gene Genius UV transilluminator equipped with a photographic camera. The quantification of oligonucleosomal DNA fragments was performed as previously described with some modifications (25.Ioannou Y.A. Chen F.W. Quantitation of DNA fragmentation in apoptosis.Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 992-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the adequate treatments, 2 × 106 cells were lysed by the addition of 300 μl of DNA fragmentation lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). After the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 and NaCl to a final concentration of 4% and 1 m, respectively, samples were placed on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatants were removed and treated with proteinase K and DNase-free RNase A at a final concentration of 200 and 20 μg/ml, respectively. A third part of the supernatants was used to determine the concentration of DNA by adding an equal volume of Hoechst dye solution (0.2 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in PBS, pH 7.4) to an aliquot (50 μl) of the supernatant. After 20 min at room temperature, fluorescence of the samples was determined at 360-nm excitation, 460-nm emission on a BIO-TEK Synergy HT Fluorometer. The remaining supernatants were used to isolate and precipitate DNA as described for oligonucleosomal DNA degradation analysis. The procedure employed for these experiments was the same as that described by Barry and Eastman (26.Barry M.A. Eastman A. Identification of deoxyribonuclease II as an endonuclease involved in apoptosis.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were seeded in 12-multiwell plates, and after 24 h they were treated with 1 μm STP for 6 h. Then cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g and washed once with PBS. Meanwhile, 150 ml of 2% agarose in 1× TBE (89 mm Tris-base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) was poured into a horizontal gel support (15 × 15 cm) with the comb at 3.5 cm from one end. Once gelled, the portion of the gel placed 1 mm above the comb was removed by cutting with a scalpel and replaced with 50 ml of 1% agarose, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 64 μg/ml proteinase K in 1× TBE buffer. Before loading, each pellet of cells was resuspended in 15 μl of 1:1 sample buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 50% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) plus 10 mg/ml RNase A. The gel was electrophoresed at room temperature for 16 h at 45 V. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained in 2 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 2 h and washed twice with distilled water for 30 min. DNA was visualized using a Syngene Gene Genius UV transilluminator coupled with a photographic camera. Approximately 1 × 106 cells/condition were detached from the 35-mm culture dish, pelleted at 600 × g for 5 min, and washed once with PBS. Then cells were lysed for 15 min on ice with 50 μl of Triton buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The supernatants were clarified by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Alternatively, cells were lysed with 100 μl of SET buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) and heated at 95 °C for 10 min to obtain total protein extracts. The protein concentration in the supernatants was quantified by a modified Lowry assay (DC protein assay, Bio-Rad), and 15–30 μg of protein were loaded in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were electrophoresed and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Ibérica S.A. U) or Protran nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Whatman GmbH, Dassel, Germany). After blocking with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk, the membranes were probed with the appropriate specific primary antibodies and incubated with the adequate secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase. Finally, immunoblots were developed with the EZ-ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit-Haemek, Israel). Quantitative DEVD-like activities in cell lysates were performed as previously described (27.Yuste V.J. Bayascas J.R. Llecha N. Sánchez-López I. Boix J. Comella J.X.

The resulting 96-multiwell microplates were incubated at 35 °C, and caspase activity was measured after 7 h of incubation in a BIO-TEK Synergy HT fluorimeter with an excitation filter of 360 nm (40-nm bandwidth) and emission filter of 530 nm (25-nm bandwidth). Cytosolic extracts were obtained by a modified protocol form previously described (27.Yuste V.J. Bayascas J.R. Llecha N. Sánchez-López I. Boix J. Comella J.X.

Cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks and treated with 1 μm STP for 12 h or left untreated. Cells were collected and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min, washed with PBS, resuspended in 5 volumes of cytosolic extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2.5% glycerol, 0.5% Igepal CA-630), and swelled at 4 °C for 15 min. The lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C to remove the nuclei, and the supernatants were centrifuged again at 16,000 × g for 15 min and then quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay Lowry-based method. Nuclei were obtained as previously described (27.Yuste V.J. Bayascas J.R. Llecha N. Sánchez-López I. Boix J. Comella J.X.

To reconstitute the system, cytosolic extracts and purified nuclei from the different conditions were adequately combined. Thus, 150 μg of protein from cytosolic extracts treated with 1.5 μg of RNase A for 10 min at 25 °C and 6 × 105 nuclei were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in a 2× reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) in a 100-μl reaction. Reactions were stopped by adding 5 mm EDTA. Nuclei were centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g (4 °C), and the pellet was washed once with cytosolic extraction buffer. DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and ethanol precipitation and DNA laddering was analyzed in a 1.8% agarose gel. The subfractionation protocol was performed as previously described by Méndez and Stillman (29.Méndez J. Stillman B. Chromatin association of human origin recognition complex, cdc6, and minichromosome maintenance proteins during the cell cycle. Assembly of prereplication complexes in late mitosis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were seeded in 35-mm culture dishes and treated with 1 μm STP for 6 h. Then cells were collected with their medium, centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 3 volumes (60 μl) of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were incubated for 5 min on ice, and nuclei were collected by low speed centrifugation (4 min, 1300 × g, 4 °C). The supernatants were further clarified by high speed centrifugation (20 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C) obtaining the cytosolic (C) fraction. The resulting pellets were washed twice in buffer A without Triton X-100 and then lysed in 60 μl of Triton buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Then, the supernatants were clarified by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain the nuclear (N) fraction. Alternatively, the nuclear fractions were resuspended in 60 μl of buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, supplemented with 1× protease inhibitors) and kept on ice for 15 min. Then samples were clarified by centrifugation (4 min, 1700 × g, 4 °C). Supernatants were considered the nucleoplasmic (N1) fractions. The pellets obtained were washed once in buffer B and centrifuged again under the same conditions. The final resulting pellets were resuspended in 60 μl of SET buffer and heated at 95 °C for 10 min, obtaining the chromatin-enriched (N2) fractions. The protein concentration in the different fractions recovered was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay Lowry-based method, and 15–20 μg of protein from each fraction were loaded in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. mRNA was isolated from untreated SK-N-AS cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, employing for the extraction the RLN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 1000 units/ml RNase inhibitor, 1 mm DTT). Total RNA (2 μg) from SK-N-AS was reverse-transcribed (Trasnscriptor First Strand cDNA synthesis kit, Roche Applied Science) using 10 pmol of random hexamer primers or the specific downstream primer (CAD-R; see below) for 30 min at 65 °C. cDNA obtained (2 μl) was amplified by PCR in an Applied Biosystem thermal cycler 2720 with 300 nm concentrations of each primer. The PCR conditions were 95 °C for 20 s, 56 °C for 10 s, and 70 °C for 24 s, repeated 30 cycles, in 1.5 mm MgSO4, 200 nm each dNTP, and 1 unit of KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Merck KGaA). Primers used were CAD forward (5′-CAGAGGGCTTGAGGACAT-3′) and CAD reverse (5′-TCAGGCCTCAAACAAAGACCAGGA-3′), amplifying a band of 1080 bp corresponding to the whole ORF of human DFF40/CAD (GenBankTM accession number NM_004402). The PCR products were automatically sequenced in both directions in a 3130XL genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). DFF40/CAD full-length open reading frame cDNA sequence from SK-N-AS cells was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The construct was named pcDNA3-DFF40/CAD and transfected in SK-N-AS cells using Attractene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cells were selected for a month in the presence of 1 mg/ml G-418 (Geneticin) (Invitrogen) and were used as a pool. DFF40/CAD overexpression was assessed by Western blot analysis. We previously reported the existence of two human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines, IMR-5 and IMR-32, cells that undergo a non-canonical apoptotic cell death upon apoptotic insult (30.Boix J.

This kind of cell death, although caspase-dependent, was characterized by the absence of both nuclear stage II apoptotic morphology (condensation and fragmentation of the cell nuclei) and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation (27.Yuste V.J.

https://openalex.org/W2056484137,"Following attachment and internalization, mammalian reoviruses undergo intracellular proteolytic disassembly followed by viral penetration into the cytoplasm. The initiating event in reovirus disassembly is the cathepsin-mediated proteolytic degradation of viral outer capsid protein σ3. A single tyrosine-to-histidine mutation at amino acid 354 (Y354H) of strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) σ3 enhances reovirus disassembly and confers resistance to protease inhibitors such as E64. The σ3 amino acid sequence of strain type 3 Abney (T3A) differs from that of T3D at eight positions including Y354H. However, T3A displays disassembly kinetics and protease sensitivity comparable with T3D. We hypothesize that one or more additional σ3 polymorphisms suppress the Y354H phenotype and restore T3D disassembly characteristics. To test this hypothesis, we engineered a panel of reovirus variants with T3A σ3 polymorphisms introduced individually into T3D-σ3Y354H. We evaluated E64 resistance and in vitro cathepsin L susceptibility of these viruses and found that one containing a glycine-to-glutamate substitution at position 198 (G198E) displayed disassembly kinetics and E64 sensitivity similar to those properties of T3A and T3D. Additionally, viruses containing changes at positions 233 and 347 (S233L and I347T) developed de novo compensatory mutations at position 198, strengthening the conclusion that residue 198 is a key determinant of σ3 proteolytic susceptibility. Variants with Y354H in σ3 lost infectivity more rapidly than T3A or T3D following heat treatment, an effect abrogated by G198E. These results identify a regulatory network of residues that control σ3 cleavage and capsid stability, thus providing insight into the regulation of nonenveloped virus disassembly."
https://openalex.org/W2156905813,"DNA translocators of natural transformation systems are complex systems critical for the uptake of free DNA and provide a powerful mechanism for adaptation to changing environmental conditions. In natural transformation machineries, outer membrane secretins are suggested to form a multimeric pore for the uptake of external DNA. Recently, we reported on a novel structure of the DNA translocator secretin complex, PilQ, in Thermus thermophilus HB27 comprising a stable cone and cup structure and six ring structures with a large central channel. Here, we report on structural and functional analyses of a set of N-terminal PilQ deletion derivatives in T. thermophilus HB27. We identified 136 N-terminal residues exhibiting an unusual ααβαββα fold as a ring-building domain. Deletion of this domain had a dramatic effect on twitching motility, adhesion, and piliation but did not abolish natural transformation. These findings provide clear evidence that the pilus structures of T. thermophilus are not essential for natural transformation. The truncated complex was not affected in inner and outer membrane association, indicating that the 136 N-terminal residues are not essential for membrane targeting. Analyses of complex formation of the truncated PilQ monomers revealed that the region downstream of residue 136 is required for multimerization, and the region downstream of residue 207 is essential for monomer stability. Possible implications of our findings for the mechanism of DNA uptake are discussed."

Adapter molecules such as Grb2 and CrkL interact with proline-rich region and activate multiple Bcr-Abl downstream signaling pathways that contribute to growth and survival. Therefore, the oncogenic effect of Bcr-Abl could be inhibited by the interaction of small molecules with these domains. Apoptin is a viral protein with well-documented cancer-selective cytotoxicity. Apoptin attributes such as SH2-like sequence similarity with CrkL SH2 domain, unique SH3 domain binding sequence, presence of proline-rich segments, and its nuclear affinity render the molecule capable of interaction with Bcr-Abl. Despite almost two decades of research, the mode of apoptin's action remains elusive because 3D structure of apoptin is unavailable. We performed in silico three-dimensional modeling of apoptin, molecular docking experiments between apoptin model and the known structure of Bcr-Abl, and the 3D structures of SH2 domains of CrkL and Bcr-Abl. We also biochemically validated some of the interactions that were first predicted in silico. This structure-property relationship of apoptin may help in unlocking its cancer-selective toxic properties. Moreover, such models will guide us in developing of a new class of potent apoptin-like molecules with greater selectivity and potency."
https://openalex.org/W2004004677,"Pharmacological resistance is a serious threat to the clinical success of hormone therapy for breast cancer. The antiproliferative response to antagonistic drugs such as tamoxifen (Tam) critically depends on the recruitment of NCoR/SMRT corepressors to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) bound to estrogen target genes. Under certain circumstances, as demonstrated in the case of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) treatment, the protein Tab2 interacts with ERα/NCoR and causes dismissal of NCoR from these genes, leading to loss of the antiproliferative response. In Tam-resistant (TamR) ER-positive breast cancer cells, we observed that Tab2 presents a shift in mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate--PAGE (SDS-PAGE) similar to that seen in MCF7 wt upon stimulation with IL-1β, suggesting constitutive activation. Accordingly, TamR treatment with Tab2-specific short interfering RNA, restored the antiproliferative response to Tam in these cells. As Tab2 is known to directly interact with the N-terminal domain of ERα, we synthesized a peptide composed of a 14-aa motif of this domain, which effectively competes with ERα/Tab2 interaction in pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, fused to the carrier TAT peptide to allow internalization. Treatment of TamR cells with this peptide resulted in partial recovery of the antiproliferative response to Tam, suggesting a strategy to revert pharmacological resistance in breast cancer. Silencing of Tab2 in TamR cells by siRNA caused modulation of a gene set related to the control of cell cycle and extensively connected to BRCA1 in a functional network. These genes were able to discern two groups of patients, from a published data set of Tam-treated breast cancer profiles, with significantly different disease-free survival. Altogether, our data implicate Tab2 as a mediator of resistance to endocrine therapy and as a potential new target to reverse pharmacological resistance and potentiate antiestrogen action."
https://openalex.org/W2078349217,"The type II secretion system of Gram-negative bacteria is important for bacterial pathogenesis and survival; it is composed of 12 mostly multimeric core proteins, which build a sophisticated secretion machine spanning both bacterial membranes. OutC is the core component of the inner membrane subcomplex thought to be involved in both recognition of substrate and interaction with the outer membrane secretin OutD. Here, we report the solution structure of the HR domain of OutC and explore its interaction with the secretin. The HR domain adopts a β-sandwich-like fold consisting of two β-sheets each composed of three anti-parallel β-strands. This structure is strikingly similar to the periplasmic region of PilP, an inner membrane lipoprotein from the type IV pilus system highlighting the common evolutionary origin of these two systems and showing that all the core components of the type II secretion system have a structural or sequence ortholog within the type IV pili system. The HR domain is shown to interact with the N0 domain of the secretin. The importance of this interaction is explored in the context of the functional secretion system."

Here, we show that cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I-knock-out (cGKI-/-) mice are unable to respond to a physiological H+ stimulus with a HCO3- secretory response and spontaneously develop duodenal ulcerations. Smooth muscle-selective cGKI knock-in rescued the motility disturbance but not the defective HCO3- secretion. Proton-induced HCO3- secretion was not attenuated by selective inactivation of the cGKI gene in interstitial cells of Cajal or in enterocytes, but was abolished by inactivation of cGKI in neurons (ncGKI-/-). cGKI was expressed in the brainstem nucleus tractus solitarius that connects the afferent with the efferent N. vagus. Accordingly, truncation of the subdiaphragmal N. vagus significantly diminished proton-induced HCO3- secretion in wild-type mice, whereas stimulation of the subdiaphragmal N. vagus elicited a similar HCO3- secretory response in cGKI-/-, ncGKI-/- and wild-type mice. These findings show that protection of the duodenum from acid injury requires neuronal cGKI.—Singh, A. K., Spieβberger, B., Zheng, W., Xiao, F., Lukowski, R., Wegener, J.

https://openalex.org/W2121043573,"Ginkgo biloba extracts are currently used for a wide range of health-related conditions. Some of the medical benefits of these extracts are controversial, but their lack of toxicity in humans is not in doubt. These extracts are, however, highly toxic to insects. Their active components (ginkgolides and bilobalide) have structures similar to the convulsant picrotoxin, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, so their lack of toxicity in mammals is puzzling. Here, we show that the different compositions of insect and vertebrate GABA receptor pores are responsible for the differing toxicities. Insect GABA receptors contain Ala at their 2' position in the pore. Substitution with Val, which is the equivalent residue in vertebrate GABA(A) receptor α-subunits, decreases ginkgolide potency by up to 10,000-fold. The reverse mutation in vertebrate GABA(A) α1 subunits increased the sensitivity of α1β2 and α1β2γ2 receptors to ginkgolides. Mutant cycle analysis demonstrates a strong interaction between the ginkgolides and the 2' residue, a result supported by in silico docking of compounds into a model of the pore. We conclude that the insecticidal activity of G. biloba extracts can be attributed to their effects at insect GABA receptors, and the presence of a Val at the 2' position in vertebrate GABA(A) receptors explains why these compounds are not similarly toxic to humans."
https://openalex.org/W1998480876,"Background Differential selection between clones of apomictic species may result in ecological differentiation without mutation and recombination, thus offering a simple system to study adaptation and life-history evolution in plants. Methodology/Principal Findings We caused density-independent mortality by weeding to colonizer populations of the largely apomictic Taraxacum officinale (Asteraceae) over a 5-year period in a grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment). We compared the offspring of colonizer populations with resident populations deliberately sown into similar communities. Plants raised from cuttings and seeds of colonizer and resident populations were grown under uniform conditions. Offspring from colonizer populations had higher reproductive output, which was in general agreement with predictions of r-selection theory. Offspring from resident populations had higher root and leaf biomass, fewer flower heads and higher individual seed mass as predicted under K-selection. Plants grown from cuttings and seeds differed to some degree in the strength, but not in the direction, of their response to the r- vs. K-selection regime. More diverse communities appeared to exert stronger K-selection on resident populations in plants grown from cuttings, while we did not find significant effects of increasing species richness on plants grown from seeds. Conclusions/Significance Differentiation into r- and K-strategists suggests that clones with characteristics of r-strategists were selected in regularly weeded plots through rapid colonization, while increasing plant diversity favoured the selection of clones with characteristics of K-strategists in resident populations. Our results show that different selection pressures may result in a rapid genetic differentiation within a largely apomictic species. Even under the assumption that colonizer and resident populations, respectively, happened to be r- vs. K-selected already at the start of the experiment, our results still indicate that the association of these strategies with the corresponding selection regimes was maintained during the 5-year experimental period."
https://openalex.org/W2124622046,"Group B Streptococcus pili are covalently linked structures assembled via a sortase-catalyzed transpeptidation mechanism involving specific residues and motifs. A sequence element containing a conserved glutamic acid, called the E-box, has been described to be involved in pilus formation. Although it is known that the glutamic acid is involved in stabilizing the internal isopeptide bonds, its role in pilus assembly still needs to be investigated. Using site-specific mutagenesis and complementation studies of knockout strains, we found that the E-box glutamic residue of the backbone and the major ancillary proteins is essential for pilus protein polymerization. NMR analysis revealed that the mutation of this residue seriously affected the folding of the protein. By contrast, the mutation of the lysine involved in the same isopeptide bond did not engender a structural destabilization, and the native fold was preserved. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations on the E-box-containing domain of the backbone protein showed that the E-box glutamic acid is necessary to maintain the appropriate dryness of the domain core and that its mutation favors an unfolded state. The data provide the first direct evidence that the E-box has an additional and key role in maintaining the correct protein fold independently of isopeptide bond formation.—Cozzi, R., Nuccitelli, A., D'Onofrio, M., Necchi, F., Rosini, R., Zerbini, F., Biagini, M., Norais, N., Beier, C., Telford, J.

https://openalex.org/W2130059004,"Viral genomes are continually subjected to mutations, and functionally deleterious ones can be rescued by reversion or additional mutations that restore fitness. The error prone nature of HIV-1 replication has resulted in highly diverse viral sequences, and it is not clear how viral proteins such as Tat, which plays a critical role in viral gene expression and replication, retain their complex functions. Although several important amino acid positions in Tat are conserved, we hypothesized that it may also harbor functionally important residues that may not be individually conserved yet appear as correlated pairs, whose analysis could yield new mechanistic insights into Tat function and evolution. To identify such sites, we combined mutual information analysis and experimentation to identify coevolving positions and found that residues 35 and 39 are strongly correlated. Mutation of either residue of this pair into amino acids that appear in numerous viral isolates yields a defective virus; however, simultaneous introduction of both mutations into the heterologous Tat sequence restores gene expression close to wild-type Tat. Furthermore, in contrast to most coevolving protein residues that contribute to the same function, structural modeling and biochemical studies showed that these two residues contribute to two mechanistically distinct steps in gene expression: binding P-TEFb and promoting P-TEFb phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain in RNAPII. Moreover, Tat variants that mimic HIV-1 subtypes B or C at sites 35 and 39 have evolved orthogonal strengths of P-TEFb binding versus RNAPII phosphorylation, suggesting that subtypes have evolved alternate transcriptional strategies to achieve similar gene expression levels.

https://openalex.org/W1964258696,"The output of state-of-the-art reverse-engineering methods for biological networks is often based on the fitting of a mathematical model to the data. Typically, different datasets do not give single consistent network predictions but rather an ensemble of inconsistent networks inferred under the same reverse-engineering method that are only consistent with the specific experimentally measured data. Here, we focus on an alternative approach for combining the information contained within such an ensemble of inconsistent gene networks called meta-analysis, to make more accurate predictions and to estimate the reliability of these predictions. We review two existing meta-analysis approaches; the Fisher transformation combined coefficient test (FTCCT) and Fisher's inverse combined probability test (FICPT); and compare their performance with five well-known methods, ARACNe, Context Likelihood or Relatedness network (CLR), Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRNET), Relevance Network (RN) and Bayesian Network (BN). We conducted in-depth numerical ensemble simulations and demonstrated for biological expression data that the meta-analysis approaches consistently outperformed the best gene regulatory network inference (GRNI) methods in the literature. Furthermore, the meta-analysis approaches have a low computational complexity. We conclude that the meta-analysis approaches are a powerful tool for integrating different datasets to give more accurate and reliable predictions for biological networks."
