https://openalex.org/W2959332613,"The possibilities of computer-based cognitive training (CCT) in postponing the onset of dementia are currently unclear, but promising. Our aim is to investigate older adults´ adherence to a long-term CCT program, and which participant characteristics are associated with adherence to the CCT. This study was part of the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER). Participants were 60-77-year-old individuals with increased dementia risk, recruited from previous population-based studies. The participants included in this study (n = 631) had been randomized to receive a multi-domain lifestyle intervention, including CCT. The measure of adherence was the number of completed CCT sessions (max = 144) as continuous measure. Due to a substantial proportion of participants with 0 sessions, the zero inflated negative binomial regression analyses were used to enable assessment of both predictors of starting the training and predictors of completing a higher number of training sessions. Several cognitive, demographic, lifestyle, and health-related variables were examined as potential predictors of adherence to CCT. Altogether, 63% of the participants participated in the CCT at least once, 20% completed at least half of the training, and 12% completed all sessions. Previous experience with computers, being married or cohabiting, better memory performance, and positive expectations toward the study predicted greater odds for starting CCT. Previous computer use was the only factor associated with a greater number of training sessions completed. Our study shows that there is a large variation in adherence to a long-lasting CCT among older adults with an increased risk of dementia. The results indicate that encouraging computer use, and taking into account the level of cognitive functioning, may help boost adherence to CCT."
https://openalex.org/W2957926455,"Over the past few decades, the prevalence of hypertension has dramatically increased in Sub-Saharan Africa. Poor adherence has been identified as a major cause of failure to control hypertension. Scarce data are available in Africa.We assessed adherence to medication and identified socioeconomics, clinical and treatment factors associated with low adherence among hypertensive patients in 12 sub-Saharan African countries.We conducted a cross-sectional survey in urban clinics of both low and middle income countries. Data were collected by physicians on demographics, treatment and clinical data among hypertensive patients attending the clinics. Adherence was assessed by questionnaires completed by the patients. Factors associated with low adherence were investigated using logistic regression with a random effect on countries.There were 2198 individuals from 12 countries enrolled in the study. Overall, 678 (30.8%), 738 (33.6%), 782 (35.6%) participants had respectively low, medium and high adherence to antihypertensive medication. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of traditional medicine (OR: 2.28, 95%CI [1.79-2.90]) and individual wealth index (low vs. high wealth: OR: 1.86, 95%CI [1.35-2.56] and middle vs. high wealth: OR: 1.42, 95%CI [1.11-1.81]) were significantly and independently associated with poor adherence to medication. In stratified analysis, these differences in adherence to medication according to individual wealth index were observed in low-income countries (p<0.001) but not in middle-income countries (p = 0.17). In addition, 26.5% of the patients admitted having stopped their treatment due to financial reasons and this proportion was 4 fold higher in the lowest than highest wealth group (47.8% vs 11.4%) (p<0.001).This study revealed the high frequency of poor adherence in African patients and the associated factors. These findings should be useful for tailoring future programs to tackle hypertension in low income countries that are better adapted to patients, with a potential associated enhancement of their effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2960158389,"We characterized clinical isolates of Campylobacter using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for detection of virulence genes, antimicrobial resistance markers and phylogenetic analysis in order to increase the knowledge on the molecular epidemiology of Campylobacter in Ireland, where there are significant gaps due to the widespread in the use of culture independent methods for the diagnosis of campylobacteriosis.WGS was applied to 122 Campylobacter human isolates collected over a 10-years period, from diarrhoeal stool samples submitted for routine enteric screening.Genes associated with cytotoxin production such as cdtA, cdtB and cdtC were found in 88%, 89% and 89% isolates, respectively; adherence, colonization and invasion genes such as cadF, dnaJ, racR, iam, virB11 and ciaB were found in 99%, 99%, 98%, 99%, 1% and 80% isolates, respectively. Genetic markers associated with resistance to quinolones (C257T in gyrA), beta-lactams (blaoxa-61) and tetracycline (tet(O)) were present in 43%, 71% and 25% isolates, respectively. The cmeABC operon was present in 94% of isolates. No macrolide or aminoglycoside resistance markers were detected. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 112 isolates were assigned to 29 sequence types grouped into 17 clonal complexes. Four clusters previously unidentified were detected. These results shown the similarity of Irish data compared to what has been described globally.WGS has shown a high discriminatory power for cluster detection, demonstrating that its integration in routine laboratory surveillance could improve the detection and management of outbreaks. In addition we were able to demonstrate that virulence genes in clinical Campylobacter infections in Ireland were similar to those known previously. High prevalence of quinolone resistance markers has been found, which has implications for antimicrobial stewardship."
https://openalex.org/W2960229777,"The study investigated the association between emotional intelligence and academic success among undergraduates of Kohat University of Science & Technology (KUST), Pakistan. A sample of 186 students who were enrolled during the semester Fall 2015 to Spring 2018 was selected through a random sampling technique. A cross-sectional, descriptive and correlational research methods were employed in this study. A standardized tool ""Emotional Intelligence Scale"" was employed for the collection of information from the undergraduates. Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of the students was considered as academic success. Data were collected through personal visits. Statistical tools i.e., simple percentage, mean, standard deviation, ANOVA, Pearson's product-moment correlation and multiple linear regression were employed to reach the desired research outcomes. The findings revealed that there was a strong positive relationship (r = 0.880) between emotional intelligence and academic success among undergraduate students. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that self-development (Beta = 0.296), emotional stability (Beta = 0.197), managing relations (Beta = 0.170), altruistic behaviour (Beta = 0.145), and commitment (Beta = 0.117) predict academic success of undergraduates positively. The findings suggest that the emotional intelligence of the undergraduate students may be further improved so that their academic performance may further be enhanced."
https://openalex.org/W2961748725,"Social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) are ideological attitudes that predict lower concern for the environment and less willingness to act on climate change. Research generally shows that SDO and RWA exhibit moderate, negative relationships with environmentalism. We examine the longitudinal influence of SDO and RWA on people’s willingness to change their behaviour to benefit the environment in a national probability sample over five years. We show that both ideological attitudes relate to lower environmentalism across time and that the SDO effect was stronger than the RWA effect, yet the association from environmentalism to later endorsement of SDO is stronger than the reverse. Interestingly, these findings suggest that the more likely temporal association flows from environmentalism to SDO."
https://openalex.org/W2956535300,"Despite advances in technology, there are still constraints on the use of some tracking devices for small species when gathering high temporal and spatial resolution data on movement and resource use. For small species, weight limits imposed on GPS loggers and the consequent impacts on battery life, restrict the volume of data that can be collected. Research on home range and habitat selection for these species should therefore incorporate a consideration of how different sampling parameters and methods may affect the structure of the data and the conclusions drawn. However, factors such as these are seldom explicitly considered. We applied two commonly-used methods of home range estimation, Movement-based Kernel Density Estimation (MKDE) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to investigate the influence of fix rate, tracking duration and method on home range size and habitat selection, using GPS tracking data collected at two different fix rates from a small, aerially-insectivorous bird, the European nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus. Effects of tracking parameters varied with home range estimation method. Fix rate and tracking duration most strongly explained change in MKDE and KDE home range size respectively. Total number of fixes and tracking duration had the strongest impact on habitat selection. High between- and within-individual variation strongly influenced outcomes and was most evident when exploring the effects of varying tracking duration. To reduce skew and bias in home range size estimation and especially habitat selection caused by individual variation and estimation method, we recommend tracking animals for the longest period possible even if this results in a reduced fix rate. If accurate movement properties, (e.g. trajectory length and turning angle) and biologically-representative movement occurrence ranges are more important, then a higher fix rate should be used, but priority habitats can still be identified with an infrequent sampling strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2958187241,"This study investigated the relationship between the ground reaction force-time profile of a countermovement jump (CMJ) and fatigue, specifically focusing on predicting the onset of neuromuscular versus metabolic fatigue using the CMJ.Ten recreational athletes performed 5 CMJs at time points prior to, immediately following, and at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 24 and 48 h after training, which comprised repeated sprint sessions of low, moderate, or high workloads. Features of the concentric portion of the CMJ force-time signature at the measurement time points were analysed using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and functional PCA (fPCA) to better understand fatigue onset given training workload. In addition, Linear Mixed Effects (LME) models were developed to predict the onset of fatigue.The first two Principal Components (PCs) using PCA explained 68% of the variation in CMJ features, capturing variation between athletes through weighted combinations of force, concentric time and power. The next two PCs explained 9.9% of the variation and revealed fatigue effects between 6 to 48 h after training for PC3, and contrasting neuromuscular and metabolic fatigue effects in PC4. fPCA supported these findings and further revealed contrasts between metabolic and neuromuscular fatigue effects in the first and second half of the force-time curve in PC3, and a double peak effect in PC4. Subsequently, CMJ measurements up to 0.5 h after training were used to predict relative peak CMJ force, with mean squared errors of 0.013 and 0.015 at 6 and 48 h corresponding to metabolic and neuromuscular fatigue.The CMJ was found to provide a strong predictor of neuromuscular and metabolic fatigue, after accounting for force, concentric time and power. This method can be used to assist coaches to individualise future training based on CMJ response to the immediate session."
https://openalex.org/W2958256204,"The objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of zinc supplementation on diarrhea and average daily weight gain (ADG) in pre-weaned dairy calves. A total of 1,482 healthy Holstein heifer and bull calves from a large California dairy were enrolled at 24 to 48 hours of age until hutch exit at approximately 90 days of age. Calves were block-randomized by time to one of three treatments: 1) placebo, 2) zinc methionine (ZM), or 3) zinc sulfate (ZS) administered in milk once daily for 14 days. Serum total protein at enrollment and body weight at birth, treatment end, and hutch exit were measured. Fecal consistency was assessed daily for 28 days post-enrollment. For a random sample of 127 calves, serum zinc concentrations before and after treatment and a fecal antigen ELISA at diarrhea start and resolution for Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium parvum were performed. Linear regression showed that ZM-treated bull calves had 22 g increased ADG compared to placebo-treated bulls (P = 0.042). ZM-treated heifers had 9 g decreased ADG compared to placebo-treated heifers (P = 0.037), after adjusting for average birth weight. Sex-stratified models showed that high birth weight heifers treated with ZM gained more than placebo-treated heifers of the same birth weight, which suggests a dose-response effect rather than a true sex-specific effect of ZM on ADG. Cox regression showed that ZM and ZS-treated calves had a 14.7% (P = 0.015) and 13.9% (P = 0.022) reduced hazard of diarrhea, respectively, compared to placebo-treated calves. Calves supplemented for at least the first five days of diarrhea with ZM and ZS had a 21.4% (P = 0.027) and 13.0% (P = 0.040) increased hazard of cure from diarrhea, respectively, compared to placebo-treated calves. Logistic regression showed that the odds of microbiological cure at diarrhea resolution for rotavirus, C. parvum, or any single fecal pathogen was not different between treatment groups. Zinc supplementation delayed diarrhea and expedited diarrhea recovery in pre-weaned calves. Additionally, zinc improved weight gain differentially in bulls compared to heifers, indicating a research need for sex-specific dosing."
https://openalex.org/W2961483499,"Introduction We aimed to investigate whether providing parents with children in kindergarten with access to different bicycle types could influence (i) travel behavior and cycling amount, and (ii) intrinsic motivation for cycling and psychological constructs related to car use. Methods A randomized, controlled trial was conducted in Southern Norway from September 2017 to June 2018. In total 36 parents were recruited and randomly drawn into an intervention (n = 18) or control group (n = 18). The intervention group was in random order equipped with an e-bike with trailer (n = 6), a cargo (longtail) bike (n = 6) and a traditional bike with trailer (n = 6). Results At follow-up, more participants from the intervention group (vs. the control group) were classified as cyclists to the workplace (n = 7 (38.9%) vs. n = 1 (5.9%), p = 0.04), but not to the kindergarten (n = 6 (33.3%) vs. n = 2 (11.8%), p = 0.23) or to the grocery store (n = 2 (11.1%) vs. n = 0 (0%), p = 0.49). A significant (p = ≤0.05) increase in cycling frequency (0.1 to 2.0 days/week) from baseline to follow-up was found in the intervention group for all destinations and seasons, except to the grocery store during winter (p = 0.16). A decrease in frequency of car driving (-0.2 to -1.7 days/week) was found to be apparent in terms of travelling to the workplace and the kindergarten for all seasons, yet not to the grocery store for any season (p = 0.15–0.49). The intervention group (vs. the control group) reported significantly higher “intrinsic regulation” for cycling (p = 0.01) at follow-up. Conclusion Access to different bike types for parents with children attending kindergarten resulted in overall increased cycling, decreased car use and higher intrinsic motivation for cycling. E-bikes obtained the greatest cycling amount in total, with the smallest sample variability. Hence, providing parents with children in kindergarten with access to e-bikes might result in increased and sustained cycling, also during the winter season."
https://openalex.org/W2957413707,"Computed, high-resolution, spatial distributions of solvation energy and entropy can provide detailed information about the role of water in molecular recognition. While grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST) provides rigorous, detailed thermodynamic information from explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations, recent developments in the 3D reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory allow many of the same quantities to be calculated in a fraction of the time. However, 3D-RISM produces atomic-site, rather than molecular, density distributions, which are difficult to extract physical meaning from. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a method to reconstruct molecular density distributions from atomic-site density distributions. Furthermore, we assess the quality of the resulting solvation thermodynamics density distributions by analyzing the binding site of coagulation Factor Xa with both GIST and 3D-RISM. We find good qualitative agreement between the methods for oxygen and hydrogen densities as well as direct solute-solvent energetic interactions. However, 3D-RISM predicts lower energetic and entropic penalties for moving water from the bulk to the binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2962435336,"The study examines the potential influence of sub-regional variations in climate, and specifically heavy rain events, in determining relative vulnerabilities of locations in twelve Caribbean countries. An aggregate vulnerability index, referred to as the Caribbean Vulnerability Score (CVS), is created using historical demographic and socioeconomic data and climate data representing extreme rain events. Four scenarios are explored. Firstly, comparative vulnerabilities are determined when heavy rainfall is incorporated in CVS versus when it is excluded. The impact of climate change is also investigated using future climate data derived from statistical downscaling but holding demographic and socioeconomic sub-indices constant. The analysis is repeated with projections of future demographic structure from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway data (SSP3), future climate projections and constant socioeconomic. Finally, the sensitivity of the results is examined with respect to applying different weights i.e. versus using equal weights for the climate and non-climatic components of CVS as is done for the first three scenarios. Results suggest that the inclusion of historical susceptibility to rainfall extremes influences relative vulnerabilities within the Caribbean when compared to the rankings of vulnerability derived using only socioeconomic and demographic inputs. In some cases significant increases in relative rankings are noted. Projected changes in the intensity of rain events across the Caribbean region in the 2030s and 2050s, do not significantly alter the top and lowest ranked vulnerable locations when demographic and socioeconomic indices are held constant. Changes may however occur in the order of the top ranked locations dependent on scenario and time slice. In general, future shifts in relative vulnerabilities were found to be dependent on (i) changes in both future climate and demographic scenarios, (ii) the time horizons being considered, and (iii) the weighting assigned to climate in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2961665918,"Background Childhood obesity is a serious public health challenge and schools have been identified as an ideal place to implement prevention interventions. The aim of this study was to measure the cost-effectiveness of a multi-faceted school-based obesity prevention intervention targeting children aged 6–7 years when compared to ‘usual activities’. Methods A cluster randomised controlled trial in 54 schools across the West Midlands (UK) was conducted. The 12-month intervention aimed to increase physical activity by 30 minutes per day and encourage healthy eating. Costs were captured from a public sector perspective and utility-based health related outcomes measured using the CHU-9D. Multiple imputation using chained equations was used to address missing data. The cost effectiveness was measured at 30 months from baseline using a hierarchical net-benefit regression framework, that controlled for clustering and prespecified covariates. Any uncertainty in the results was characterised using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Results At 30 months, the total adjusted incremental mean cost of the intervention was £155 (95% confidence interval [CI]: £139, £171), and the incremental mean QALYs gained was 0.006 (95% CI: -0.024, 0.036), per child. The incremental cost-effectiveness at 30 months was £26,815 per QALY and using a standard willingness to pay threshold of £30,000 per QALY, there was a 52% chance that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions The cost-effectiveness of the school-based WAVES intervention was subject to substantial uncertainty. We therefore recommend more research to explore obesity prevention within schools as part of a wider systems approach to obesity prevention. Trial registration This paper uses data collected by the WAVES trial: Controlled trials ISRCTN97000586 (registered May 2010)."
https://openalex.org/W2956458086,"Carrier proteins are four-helix bundles that covalently hold metabolites and secondary metabolites, such as fatty acids, polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides. These proteins mediate the production of many pharmaceutically important compounds including antibiotics and anticancer agents. Acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) can be found as part of a multi-domain polypeptide (Type I ACPs), or as part of a multiprotein complex (Type II). Here, the main focus is on ACP2 and ACP3, domains from the type I trans-AT polyketide synthase MmpA, which is a core component of the biosynthetic pathway of the antibiotic mupirocin. During molecular dynamics simulations of their apo, holo and acyl forms ACP2 and ACP3 both form a substrate-binding surface-groove. The substrates bound to this surface-groove have polar groups on their acyl chain exposed and forming hydrogen bonds with the solvent. Bulky hydrophobic residues in the GXDS motif common to all ACPs, and similar residues on helix III, appear to prohibit the formation of a deep tunnel in type I ACPs and type II ACPs from polyketide synthases. In contrast, the equivalent positions in ACPs from type II fatty acid synthases, which do form a deep solvent-excluded substrate-binding tunnel, have the small residue alanine. During simulation, ACP3 with mutations I61A L36A W44L forms a deep tunnel that can fully bury a saturated substrate in the core of the ACP, in contrast to the surface groove of the wild type ACP3. Similarly, in the ACP from E. coli fatty acid synthase, a type II ACP, mutations can change ligand binding from being inside a deep tunnel to being in a surface groove, thus demonstrating how changing a few residues can modify the possibilities for ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W2956903071,"Land use and land cover change induced by large scale ecological restoration programs has a significant impact on the terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle, especially on the net primary productivity (NPP) in arid and semi-arid regions. This study investigated the change in NPP caused by the large-scale ecological restoration in the Chinese Loess Plateau (LPR) region from 1986 to 2015 based on land cover datasets and NPP calculated using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model. The results indicated that the annual total NPP exhibited a significant uptrend (P < 0.01) throughout the whole vegetation restoration region during the last 30 years, with an annual increase of 0.137 Tg C. A significant abrupt change was detected in 2006 for the annual total NPP series. Over half of the restoration region showed an increase in NPP in the past three decades, however, about 30~40% of the vegetation restoration region exhibited NPP loss before 2006, but subsequently NPP loss was found in only approximately 20% of the study region. Overall, the increase in NPP attributed to the vegetation restoration reached 51.14 Tg C in the past three decades, indicating that these large-scale vegetation restoration programs increased the carbon sequestration capacity of terrestrial ecosystems in the Loess Plateau. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the effects of the green campaign on terrestrial ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2956362853,"Nanomedicine is an emerging area in the medical field, particularly in the treatment of cancers. Nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) was shown to be a good nanoparticulated carrier for the delivery of tamoxifen (TAM). In this study, the tamoxifen-loaded erythropoietin-coated nanostructured lipid carriers (EPO-TAMNLC) were developed to enhance the anti-cancer properties and targetability of TAM, using EPO as the homing ligand for EPO receptors (EpoRs) on breast cancer tissue cells. Tamoxifen-loaded NLC (TAMNLC) was used for comparison. The LA7 cells and LA7 cell-induced rat mammary gland tumor were used as models in the study. Immunocytochemistry staining showed that LA7 cells express estrogen receptors (ERs) and EpoRs. EPO-TAMNLC and TAMNLC significantly (p<0.05) inhibited proliferation of LA7 in dose- and time-dependent manner. EPO-TAMNLC induced apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest of LA7 cells. Both drug delivery systems showed anti-mammary gland tumor properties. At an intravenous dose of 5 mg kg-1 body weight, EPO-TAMNLC and TAMNLC were not toxic to rats, suggesting that both are safe therapeutic compounds. In conclusion, EPO-TAMNLC is not only a unique drug delivery system because of the dual drug-loading feature, but also potentially highly specific in the targeting of breast cancer tissues positive for ERs and EpoRs. The incorporation of TAM into NLC with and without EPO coat had significantly (p<0.05) improved specificity and safety of the drug carriers in the treatment of mammary gland tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2960146229,"The association of latent toxoplasmosis with mental disorders in general and with schizophrenia in particular was noticed in the mid-1950s. In subsequent years, the role of Toxoplasma gondii was established based on its ability to survive for long periods of time in the nerve cells of the brain. The acute manifestations of the infection include psychopathic symptoms resembling those of schizophrenia. In the former USSR, and in other parts of the world, a number of studies were performed with respect to the association of latent toxoplasmosis and schizophrenia. However, with the dissolution of the USSR at the beginning of the 1990s, studies on the subject were halted due to financial problems and have resumed only recently. The reasons for the resumption of such studies in contemporary Russia are related to the progressively increasing incidence of schizophrenia over the last 25–30 years in the country. According to official data, approximately 550 000 persons reported suffering from the disease in 2014. There are reasons to believe that this is only a fraction of the real burden of the disease. Economically, it cost the state no less than approximately US $10 billion. The purpose of the study was to identify the level of toxoplasmosis seroprevalence in patients with verified diagnoses of schizophrenia in comparison to healthy people in Moscow City and in the Moscow region. A total of 155 persons constituted the patients group and 152 healthy people were in the control group. An integrated approach to the diagnosis and comparison of data from the entire spectrum of serological markers of infection was used, including the detection of specific IgM and the determination of IgG concentrations. It was found that among persons with neuropsychiatric disorders, the incidence of cases with latent toxoplasmosis was higher than in the control group. The effect of toxoplasmosis was significant and similar for men and women. Further statistical analyses revealed that among patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the incidence of latent toxoplasmosis was significantly higher than in the control group. These data are in agreement with the results of similar studies in other countries."
https://openalex.org/W2961090088,"Genetic incompatibilities constitute the final stages of reproductive isolation and speciation, but little is known about incompatibilities that occur within recent adaptive radiations among closely related diverging populations. Crossing divergent species to form hybrids can break up coadapted variation, resulting in genetic incompatibilities within developmental networks shaping divergent adaptive traits. We crossed two closely related sympatric Cyprinodon pupfish species–a dietary generalist and a specialized molluscivore–and measured expression levels in their F1 hybrids to identify regulatory variation underlying the novel craniofacial morphology found in this recent microendemic adaptive radiation. We extracted mRNA from eight day old whole-larvae tissue and from craniofacial tissues dissected from 17–20 day old larvae to compare gene expression between a total of seven F1 hybrids and 24 individuals from parental species populations. We found 3.9% of genes differentially expressed between generalists and molluscivores in whole-larvae tissues and 0.6% of genes differentially expressed in craniofacial tissue. We found that 2.1% of genes were misregulated in whole-larvae hybrids whereas 19.1% of genes were misregulated in hybrid craniofacial tissues, after correcting for sequencing biases. We also measured allele specific expression across 15,429 heterozygous sites to identify putative compensatory regulatory mechanisms underlying differential expression between generalists and molluscivores. Together, our results highlight the importance of considering misregulation as an early indicator of genetic incompatibilities in the context of rapidly diverging adaptive radiations and suggests that compensatory regulatory divergence drives hybrid gene misregulation in developing tissues that give rise to novel craniofacial traits."
https://openalex.org/W2962250064,"The user interaction in online social networks can not only reveal the social relationships among users in e-commerce systems, but also imply the social preferences of a target user for recommendation services. However, the current research has rarely explored the impact of social interaction on recommendation performance, especially now that recommender systems face increasing challenges and suffer from poor efficiency due to social data overload. Therefore, applied research on user interaction has become increasingly necessary in the field of social recommendation. In this paper, we develop a novel social recommendation method based on the user interaction in complex social networks, called the SRUI model, to present a basis for improving the efficiency of the recommender systems. Specifically, a weighted social interaction network is first mapped to represent the interactions among social users according to the gathered information about historical user behavior. Thereafter, the complete path set is mined by the complete path mining (CPM) algorithm to find social similar neighbors with tastes similar to those of the target user. Finally, the social similar tendencies of the users on the complete paths are obtained to predict the final ratings of items through the SRUI model. A series of experimental results based on two real public datasets show that our approach performs better than other state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation performance."
https://openalex.org/W2962344295,"The prominent characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) proteins in the form of plaques that cause molecular and cellular alterations in the brain. Due to the paucity of brain samples of early-stage Abeta aggregation, animal models have been developed to study early events in AD. Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetically tractable animal model for AD. Here, we used transcriptomic data, network-based protein-protein interactions and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), to detect modules and their gene ontology in response to Abeta aggregation in C. elegans. Additionally, hub genes and their orthologues in human and mouse were identified to study their relation to AD. We also found several transcription factors (TFs) responding to Abeta accumulation. Our results show that Abeta expression in C. elegans relates to general processes such as molting cycle, locomotion, and larval development plus AD-associated processes, including protein phosphorylation, and G-protein coupled receptor-regulated pathways. We reveal that many hub genes and TFs including ttbk-2, daf-16, and unc-49 have human and mouse orthologues that are directly or potentially associated with AD and neural development. In conclusion, using systems biology we identified important genes and biological processes in C. elegans that respond to Abeta aggregation, which could be used as potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets. In addition, because of evolutionary relationship to AD in human, we suggest that C. elegans is a useful model for studying early molecular events in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2962566504,"Male genitalia show considerable morphological variation among animals with internal fertilization and exhibit a high level of evolvability in lizards. Studies have suggested that sexual selection may be driving hemipenial evolution against natural selection and pleiotropy. Given the direct interaction of male and female genitals, coevolution of the aforementioned is posited by several hypotheses of genital evolution. However, there are only a few studies on female genitalia morphology, resulting in a lack of coevolution description and understanding. Studies of allometric patterns have filled some gaps by answering questions about male genital evolution and could prove a powerful tool in clarifying coevolution between male and female genitals. Here, we studied the genital morphology of Tropidurus torquatus. This Tropidurus lizard species is an emerging Neotropical lizard model organism notable for having enlarged hemipenial lobes in contrast with other tropidurid species. In this study, we analyzed hemipenial development in early and late stages, describing both morphological variation and ontogenetic allometric pattern. We used quantitative traits to describe male and female genital morphology, examining their static allometric patterns and correspondence. Our study provides a quantitative discussion on the evolution of lizard genitals, suggesting that sexual selection plays an important role in genital evolution in Tropidurus lizards."
https://openalex.org/W2957073438,"Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases that affect millions of people worldwide including those with Alzheimer's disease. While many efforts have focused on understanding the role of tau protein in neurodegeneration, there has been little done to systematically analyze and study the structures within tau's encoding RNA and their connection to disease pathology. Knowledge of RNA structure can provide insights into disease mechanisms and how to affect protein production for therapeutic benefit. Using computational methods based on thermodynamic stability and evolutionary conservation, we identified structures throughout the tau pre-mRNA, especially at exon-intron junctions and within the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). In particular, structures were identified at twenty exon-intron junctions. The 5' UTR contains one structured region, which lies within a known internal ribosome entry site. The 3' UTR contains eight structured regions, including one that contains a polyadenylation signal. A series of functional experiments were carried out to assess the effects of mutations associated with mis-regulation of alternative splicing of exon 10 and to identify regions of the 3' UTR that contain cis-regulatory elements. These studies defined novel structural regions within the mRNA that affect stability and pre-mRNA splicing and may lead to new therapeutic targets for treating tau-associated diseases."

The present study aimed to contribute toward generating empirical evidence to guide the discussion surrounding NCCR. We asked participants about whether or not they felt NCCR is wrong, whether there should be consequences for its perpetration, and contextualized responses within legal context. A total of 592 undergraduate students took part in an online survey inquiring about their experiences with and views of NCCR. We used descriptive statistics to determine sample prevalence and outcomes of NCCR and qualitatively analyzed responses to open-ended questions asking about perceptions of NCCR. Of participants who had engaged in penetrative sexual intercourse with a male partner using an external condom, 18.7%, 95% CI [14.4, 22.7] reported that they had NCCR perpetrated against them. The majority of these participants reported that they experienced NCCR negatively and encountered related consequences; several reported contracting an STI, experiencing an unplanned pregnancy, or both. Nearly all participants expressed that NCCR is wrong, citing reasons that included the lack of consent, possibility of unplanned or unwanted outcomes, and a betrayal of trust. In this study, we found that there was agreement that NCCR is wrong, but variability in responses regarding the circumstances under which there should be consequences for the action. These perceptions reflect the current uncertainty in law. We recommend researchers refer to the phenomenon as NCCR (rather than stealthing) and discuss related issues to encourage future research to adopt consistent and accurate labels and definitions for NCCR. We hope that our findings will guide future research and spur public and legal discussion on NCCR."
https://openalex.org/W2959864620,"Background The insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) technology enables consistent PCR amplification and detection in a simple heating device. A pan-dengue virus (DENV) RT-iiPCR, targeting the 5’ untranslated region, was validated previously on the semi-automated POCKIT combo system (involving separate devices for nucleic acid extraction and PCR amplification/detection) to offer performance comparable to a laboratory real-time PCR. Working on the same technologies, a compact automated sample-in-answer-out system (POCKIT Central Nucleic Acid Analyser) has been available commercially for iiPCR, minimizing human error risks and allowing easy molecular bio-detection near points of need. Here, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR on the fully automated system by comparison to those on the semi-automated system. Methodology/Principal findings Testing sera containing serial diluted DENV-1, -2, -3, or -4 cell culture stock, the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR system had similar 100% detection endpoints on the two systems; i.e. at 1, 10, 1 and 10 PFU/ml, respectively, on the fully automated system, and at 10, 1, 10 and 10 PFU/ml, respectively, on the semi-automated system. Furthermore, both fully automated and semi-automated PCR system can detect all four DENV serotypes in mosquitos. Clinical performance of the reagent on the two systems was evaluated by testing 60 human serum samples. Both systems detected the same 40 samples (ten DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 positive each) and did not detect the other 20; 100% agreement (κ = 1) was found between the two systems. Conclusions/Significance With performance comparable to a previously validated system, the fully-automated PCR system allows applications of the pan-DENV reagent as a useful tool near points of need to facilitate easy, fast and effective detection of dengue virus and help mitigate versatile public health challenges in the control and management of dengue disease."
https://openalex.org/W2957528740,"Habitat heterogeneity is an important driver of aboveground species diversity but few studies have investigated effects on soil communities. Trees shape their surrounding by both leaf litter and roots generating small scale heterogeneity and potentially governing community patterns of soil organisms. To assess the role of vegetation for the soil fauna, we studied whether tree species (Fagus sylvatica L., Acer pseudoplatanus L., Fraxinus excelsior L., Tilia cordata Mill.), markedly differing in leaf litter quality and root associated mycorrhizal symbionts, affect oribatid mite communities by shaping below- and aboveground resources and habitat complexity and availability. Oribatid mite abundance, species richness, community structure and the proportion of litter living and parthenogenetic individuals were analyzed and related to microbial biomass and the amount of remaining litter mass. Although leaf litter species with higher nutritional values decomposed considerably faster, microbial biomass only slightly differed between leaf litter species. Neither root species nor leaf litter species affected abundance, species richness or community structure of oribatid mites. However, root species had an effect on the proportion of parthenogenetic individuals with increased proportions in the presence of beech roots. Overall, the results suggest that identity and diversity of vegetation via leaf litter or roots are of minor importance for structuring oribatid mite communities of a temperate forest ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2959247264,"Background There is a lack of reliable epidemiological data on long-term survival trends of first-ever stroke patients in Lithuanian population. Aims To evaluate trends in long-term survival after stroke and to determine the influence of some sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, time and subtype of stroke, and stroke care on survival. Methods All stroke events included in Kaunas stroke register database were ascertained and validated according to the standardized criteria outlined by the WHO MONICA Project. The study included all patients in Kaunas (Lithuania) city aged 25 to 64 years who experienced a stroke between 1986 and 2011. Death time was confirmed by the Office for National Death Statistics. Estimates of stroke long-term survival data and factors influencing survival changes were made by applying the Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. Results During the study period, 4,129 persons aged 25–64 years suffered from a first-ever stroke: 2,215 (53.6%) of them were men and 1,914 (46.4%)—women. Ischemic stroke was significantly more frequent in males than in females (80.6% and 78.6%, respectively, p<0.05) and subarachnoid hemorrhage was more common in women than in men (9.0% and 7.0% respectively, p <0.05). Of all first-ever stroke patients, 3,272 (79.2%) survived 1 year and 2,905 (70.4%) survived 5 years after stroke onset. The 1- and 5-years survival rate after a first-ever stroke in women was significantly higher as compared with that in men (Log-rank test p = 0.0001). The older (55–64 year) persons had poorer 1-year and 5-years survival rate as compared with persons in the younger (25–54 years) age group (Log-rank test p = 0.0001). Among persons with a first-ever stroke who had their stroke in 2007–2011, 1- and 5-year survival rate was higher compared with that in persons who had had a stroke in 1986–1990 and in 1997–2001 (Log-rank test p = 0.0001). The persons with a first-ever ischemic stroke had a better chance to survive first 1- and 5-years after stroke compared with persons who had intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage. Only female gender was associated with higher 1- and 5-year survival rate after first-ever stroke. The older age, previous myocardial infarction and diabetes mellitus were associated with lower 1- and 5-year survival rate after first-ever stroke. Conclusions This population-based study of patients with first-ever stroke demonstrated that the long-term survival was better in women than men, and improved significantly in both men and women during the past decade. Long-term survival was better of those with first-ever ischemic stroke and of younger age– 25 to 54 years."
https://openalex.org/W2959008206,"There is a paucity of primary data to understand the overall pattern of disease and injuries as well as related health-service utilization in resource-poor countries in Africa.To generate reliable and robust data describing the pattern of emergency presentations attributable to communicable disease (CD), non-communicable disease (NCD) and injuries in three different regions of Mozambique.We undertook a pragmatic, prospective, multicentre surveillance study of individuals (all ages) presenting to the emergency departments of three hospitals in Southern (Maputo), Central (Beira) and Northern (Nampula) Mozambique. During 24-hour surveillance in the seasonally distinct months of April and October 2016/2017, we recorded data on 7,809 participants randomly selected from 39,124 emergency presentations to the three participating hospitals. Applying a pragmatic surveillance protocol, data were prospectively collected on the demography, clinical history, medical profile and treatment of study participants.A total of 4,021 males and 3,788 (48.5%) females comprising 630 infants (8.1%), 2,070 children (26.5%), 1,009 adolescents (12.9%) and, 4,100 adults (52.5%) were studied. CD was the most common presentation (3,914 cases/50.1%) followed by NCD (1,963/25.1%) and injuries (1,932/24.7%). On an adjusted basis, CD was more prevalent in younger individuals (17.9±17.7 versus 26.6±19.2 years;p<0.001), females (51.7% versus 48.7%-OR 1.137, 95%CI 1.036-1.247;p = 0.007), the capital city of Maputo (59.6%) versus the more remote cities of Beira (42.8%-OR 0.532, 95%CI 0.476-0.594) and Nampula (45.8%-OR 0.538, 95%CI 0.480-0.603) and, during April (51.1% versus 49.3% for October-OR 1.142, 95%CI 1.041-1.253;p = 0.005). Conversely, NCD was progressively more prevalent in older individuals, females and in the regional city of Beira, whilst injuries were more prevalent in males (particularly adolescent/young men) and the northern city of Nampula. On a 24-hour basis, presentation patterns were unique to each hospital.Applying highly pragmatic surveillance methods suited to the low-resource setting of Mozambique, these unique data provide critical insights into the differential pattern of CD, NCD and injury. Consequently, they highlight specific health priorities across different regions and seasons in Southern Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2961080745,"Elderly people show a decline in the ability to decode facial expressions, but also experience age-related facial structure changes that may render their facial expressions harder to decode. However, to date there is no empirical evidence to support the latter mechanism. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of age on facial morphology at rest and during smiling, in younger (n = 100; age range, 18–32 years) and older (n = 30; age range, 55–65 years) Japanese women. Three-dimensional images of each subject’s face at rest and during smiling were obtained and wire mesh fitting was performed on each image to quantify the facial surface morphology. The mean node coordinates in each facial posture were compared between the groups using t-tests. Further, the node coordinates of the fitted mesh were entered into a principal component analysis (PCA) and a multifactor analysis of variance (MANOVA) to examine the direct interactions of aging and facial postures on the 3D facial morphology. The results indicated that there were significant age-related 3D facial changes in facial expression generation and the transition from resting to smiling produced a smaller amount of soft tissue movement in the older group than in the younger group. Further, 185 surface configuration variables were extracted and the variables were used to create four discriminant functions: the age-group discrimination for each facial expression, and the facial expression discrimination for each age group. For facial expression discrimination, the older group showed 80% accuracy with 2 of 66 significant variables, whereas the younger group showed 99% accuracy with 15 of 144 significant variables. These results indicate that in both facial expressions, the facial morphology was distinctly different in the younger and older subjects, and that in the older group, the facial morphology during smiling could not be as easily discriminated from the morphology at rest as in the younger group. These results may help to explain one aspect of the communication dysfunction observed in older people."
https://openalex.org/W2961774956,"Background The potential impacts of beverage intake during the midlife on future subclinical atherosclerosis among women are unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prospective associations between the intakes of eight beverage groups and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in midlife women. Methods Data came from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation, a multicenter, multiethnic, and prospective cohort study. A total of 1,235 midlife women had measures of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and repeatedly beverage intake data collected using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Beverages were aggregated into eight groups, including coffee, tea, sugar-sweetened beverages, artificially sweetened beverages, fruit juices, whole milk, milk with lower fat content, and alcoholic beverages. The associations of beverage intake with common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) and adventitial diameter (CCA-AD) were estimated using linear models; the associations with carotid plaque were estimated using log-binomial models. Results Coffee intake was associated with CCA-IMT in an inverted J-shaped pattern. After adjusting for covariates, women with >0 to <1 cup/day and 1 to <2 cups/day of coffee intake had a 0.031 mm (95% CI: 0.012, 0.051) and a 0.027 mm (95% CI: 0.005, 0.049) larger CCA-IMT, respectively, than coffee non-drinkers. Women who consumed ≥2 cups/day of coffee did not have significantly different CCA-IMT than non-drinkers. There was an inverse linear association between moderate alcoholic beverages intake and CCA-IMT (P-trend = 0.014). Whole milk intake had inverted U-shaped associations with CCA-IMT and carotid plaque. No significant associations were found between other beverage groups and subclinical atherosclerosis. Conclusions In midlife women, occasional coffee intake may be associated with more subclinical atherosclerosis while moderate alcoholic beverages intake may be associated with less subclinical atherosclerosis. Future work should focus on the determination of the optimal beverage intake profile for maximum cardiovascular benefits in midlife women."
https://openalex.org/W2961992833,"The descriptive norm effect refers to findings that individuals will tend to prefer behaving certain ways when they know that other people behave similarly. An open question is whether individuals will still conform to other people's behaviour when they do not identify with these other people, such as a Democrat being biased towards following a popular behaviour amongst Republicans. Self-categorization theory makes the intuitive prediction that people will actively avoid conforming to the norms of groups with which they do not identify. We tested this by informing participants that a particular action was more popular amongst people they identified with and additionally informed some participants that this action was unpopular amongst people they did not identify with. Specifically, we presented descriptive norms of people who supported different political parties or had opposing stances on important social issues. Counter to self-categorization theory's prediction, we found that informing participants that an action was unpopular amongst people they did not identify with led participants' preferences to shift away from that action. These results suggest that a general desire to conform with others may outpower the common ingroup vs outgroup mentality."
https://openalex.org/W2958374695,"In this work we analyze potential environmental drivers of malaria cases in Northwestern Argentina. We inspect causal links between malaria and climatic variables by means of the convergent cross mapping technique, which provides a causality criterion from the theory of dynamic systems. Analysis is based on 12 years of weekly malaria P. vivax cases in Tartagal, Salta, Argentina—at the southern fringe of malaria incidence in the Americas—together with humidity and temperature time-series spanning the same period. Our results show that there are causal links between malaria cases and both maximum temperature, with a delay of five weeks, and minimum temperature, with delays of zero and twenty two weeks. Humidity is also a driver of malaria cases, with thirteen weeks delay between cause and effect. Furthermore we also determined the sign and strength of the effects. Temperature has always a positive non-linear effect on cases, with maximum temperature effects more pronounced above 25°C and minimum above 17°C, while effects of humidity are more intricate: maximum humidity above 85% has a negative effect, whereas minimum humidity has a positive effect on cases. These results might be signaling processes operating at short (below 5 weeks) and long (over 12 weeks) time delays, corresponding to effects related to parasite cycle and mosquito population dynamics respectively. The non-linearities found for the strength of the effect of temperature on malaria cases make warmer areas more prone to higher increases in the disease incidence. Moreover, our results indicate that an increase of extreme weather events could enhance the risks of malaria spreading and re-emergence beyond the current distribution. Both situations, warmer climate and increase of extreme events, will be remarkably increased by the end of the century in this hot spot of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2958976242,"Introduction Prognosis after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly variable. Compared to clinicopathologic factors, the use of molecular markers to predict outcome has not been well studied. We investigated the prognostic importance of thymidylate synthase (TS) gene expression and polymorphisms in patients after resection of HCC. Methods Patients who underwent complete resection of HCC for whom tissue was available were identified. TS gene expression level and polymorphisms were determined in HCC specimens. Prognostic factors were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Results The study included 67 patients. In univariate analysis, variables that negatively influenced survival included TNM stage, microvascular invasion, and high TS expression. For the high TS expression group, median survival was 54 months and 5-year actuarial survival was 47%. For the low TS expression group, median survival was not reached and the 5-year actuarial survival was 91%. In multivariate analysis, only high TS expression remained an independent predictor of poor survival (HR = 10.77, 95% CI 1.36–84.91; P = 0.02). TS gene polymorphisms were not associated with TS expression or overall survival. Conclusions High TS expression predicts poor outcome after resection of HCC. Molecular markers might be robust predictors of patient outcome after resection of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2959107428,"The light-promoted recovery of epidermal barrier of skin was evaluated by the associated recovery of transepidermal potential (TEP), the potential difference between the surface and dermis of skin, by using porcine skin samples. An accelerated recovery of TEP was observed by irradiation of red light with the irradiance of 40 mW/cm2 and a duration of > 10 min. The influence of the light stimulation to the surroundings (~ 20 mm) was also observed. The irradiations of blue and purple lights were ineffective in accelerating the barrier recovery. These characteristics of the light stimulation would be useful for the design of effective and safe phototherapy devices for skin. The present study proves that the TEP can serve as a spatiotemporal indicator of the epidermal barrier function."
https://openalex.org/W2961826114,"Temperature extremes alter development, growth, hatching, and survival of eggs of ground-nesting birds, particularly during pre-incubation (egg laying) when eggs are left unattended and exposed to the environment for days or weeks before parental incubation begins. The northern bobwhite quail is a ground-nesting bird whose eggs experience high temperatures (≥45° C) during pre-incubation. It is known that chronic high temperatures during pre-incubation alter development and reduce hatching and survival of bobwhite eggs, but it is not known if acute doses of high temperatures during pre-incubation have the same effect. In this study, the 12-d pre-incubation period was divided into thirds. Fresh bobwhite eggs were exposed to either a commercial holding temperature for all 12 d (serving as a control), or a high oscillating temperature regimen for 4 d (one third of pre-incubation) either in the early, middle, or late third of pre-incubation, with a low oscillating temperature regimen during the remaining 8 d. The timing of acute exposure to high oscillating temperatures significantly affected bobwhite development. Eggs exposed in the first 2/3 of pre-incubation developed twice as much as eggs exposed late in pre-incubation, even though all eggs received the same amount of heating degree-hours. Thus, a critical window of thermal susceptibility exists for developing northern bobwhites. Acute exposure to high oscillating temperatures resulted in reduced hatchling mass, hatching success, survival, and compromised hatching synchrony. Thus, acute hyperthermic nest temperatures during pre-incubation could result in the observed reductions in the percentage of juveniles in natural populations during hot and droughty years."
https://openalex.org/W2957280404,"Predicting the socio-economic level of an urban region is of great significance for governments and city managers when allocating resources and making decisions. However, the current approaches for estimating regional socio-economic levels heavily rely on census data, which demands significant effort in terms of time and money. With the ubiquitous usage of smart phones and the prevalence of mobile applications, massive amounts of data are generated by mobile networks that record people’s behaviors. In this paper, we propose a low-cost approach of using humans’ online and offline indicators to predict the socio-economic levels of urban regions. The results show that the socio-economic prediction model that is trained using online and offline features extracted from these data achieves a high accuracy over 85%. Notably, online features are showed to be tightly linked with socio-economic development. In environments where censuses are rarely held, our method provides an option for timely and accurate prediction of the economic status of urban regions."

Within this market, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the dominant product class. With the patent expirations, biosimilars and, perhaps more relevant, biobetters, are in fast development. Thus, a comprehensive characterization at the molecular level of antibodies heterogeneity such as glycoforms, post-translational modifications (PTMs) and sequence variations is of utmost importance. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches are undoubtedly the most powerful analytical strategies to monitor and define an array of critical quality attributes on mAbs.

This methodology involves minimal sample preparation procedures and provides an extensive collection of valuable data in a short period of time."
https://openalex.org/W2960202129,"We performed a greenhouse experiment to assess how differences in AM fungal community composition affect competitive response of grassland plant species. We used a full factorial design to determine how inoculation with natural AM fungal communities from different habitats in Western Estonia affects the growth response of two grassland forbs (Leontodon hispidus L., Plantago lanceolata L.) to competition with a dominant grass (Festuca rubra L.). We used AM fungal inocula that were known to differ in AM fungal diversity and composition: more diverse AM fungal communities from open grasslands and less diverse AM fungal communities from former grassland densely overgrown by pines (young pine forest). The presence of AM fungi balanced competition between forb and grass species, by enhancing competitive response of the forbs. The magnitude of this effect was dependent on forb species identity and on the origin of the AM fungal inoculum in the soil. The grassland inoculum enhanced the competitive response of the forb species more effectively than the forest inoculum, but inoculum-specific competitive responses varied according to the habitat preference of the forb species. Our findings provide evidence that composition and diversity of natural AM fungal communities, as well as co-adaptation of plant hosts and AM-fungal communities to local habitat conditions, can determine plant-plant interactions and thus ultimately influence plant community structure in nature."

https://openalex.org/W2959193197,"Terfezia claveryi Chatin is a mycorrhizal fungus that forms ectendomycorrhizal associations with plants of Helianthemum genus. Its appreciated edibility and drought resistance make this fungus a potential alternative crop in arid and semiarid areas of the Mediterranean region. In order to increase the knowledge about the biology of this fungus in terms of mycorrhiza formation and response to drought stress, a catalase from T. claveryi (TcCAT-1) has been purified to apparent homogeneity and biochemically characterized; in addition, the expression pattern of this enzyme during different stages of T. claveryi biological cycle and under drought stress conditions are reported. The results obtained, together with the phylogenetic analysis and homology modeling, indicate that TcCAT-1 is a homotetramer large subunit size monofunctional-heme catalase belonging to Clade 2. The highest expression of this enzyme occurs in mature mycorrhiza, revealing a possible role in mycorrhiza colonization, but it is not upregulated under drought stress. However, the H2O2 content of mycorrhizal plants submitted to drought stress is lower than in well watered treatments, suggesting that mycorrhization improves the plant's oxidative stress response, although not via TcCAT-1 upregulation."

Cox proportional hazards models with transition-specific covariates were used to model each transition in the multistate model and the Aalen-Johansen estimator was used to obtain transition probabilities and state occupation probabilities in the ED process.Acuity level, season, time of day and number of ED physicians had significant and varying associations with the six transitions in the multistate model. Race and ethnicity were significantly associated with transition to left without being seen, but not with the other transitions. Conversely, age and gender were significantly associated with registration to room and subsequent transitions in the model, though the magnitude of association was not strong.The multistate model presented in this paper decomposes the overall ED length of stay into constituent transitions for modeling covariate-specific effects on each transition. This allows physicians to understand the ED process and identify which potentially modifiable covariates would have the greatest impact on reducing the waiting times in each state in the model."
https://openalex.org/W2960999172,"Ninety-six sample plots were established for a tree census to explore the multifactor relationships between the soil and water conservation functions and the stand structure in a typical black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) plantation in the Caijiachuan watershed of the Loess Plateau, Western Shanxi Province, China. Based on the observational and experimental data, a topography-structure-function model was built using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The latent variables were the topographical factors, horizontal structure, vertical structure, soil and water conservation, and sediment reduction. The results indicated that the horizontal structure of the Robinia pseudoacacia L. forest was the most obvious latent variable, which was expressed in the path coefficient (pc = 0.85) corresponding to the sediment reduction; the stand density and tree competition index were the major drivers of the structure, with path coefficients of −0.96 and −0.92 and influence coefficients of −0.997 and −0.998. These factors are easily regulated. Among these factors the stand density of the arbor layer is recommended to be kept stable within the range from 1600 to 1700 trees/hm2. These relationships showed that reducing the tree competition index and changing the microtopography could effectively enhance the soil and water conservation functions in this ecologically significant loess area."
https://openalex.org/W2962427353,"Adaptive behaviour requires cognitive control for shielding current goals from distractors (stability) but at the same time for switching between alternative goals (flexibility). In this behavioural study, we examine the stability-flexibility balance in left- and right-handers during two types of decision-making, instructed (sensory cued) and voluntary (own choice), by means of distractor inhibition and hand/task switching. The data revealed that both groups showed opposite tendencies for instructed decision-making. Moreover, right-handers resisted distracting information more efficiently whereas left-handers showed superior switching abilities. When participants were involved in voluntary decision-making, no effects of handedness were noted, which suggests that free-choice processing alters the balance between stability and flexibility. These data illustrate that handedness is an index of individual variation during instructed decision-making, biasing the proficiency of cognitive control towards stability and flexibility of information processing. These biases can however be overruled by top-down strategies that dominate during voluntary decision-making. Overall, the research underlines the antagonistic functions of stability and flexibility in decision-making, and offers an approach for examining cognitive control and the role of internal and external factors in balancing the stability-flexibility trade-off."
https://openalex.org/W2956306792,"Background Residential density was found to be associated with excess body weight among adults in Western societies but it remains unclear in China. We aimed to explore the relationship between residential density and excess body weight among adults in China. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017 in urban areas of Nanjing, China. A multi-stage sampling method was used to randomly select participants aged 35–74 years from 8 urban neighborhoods in Nanjing. Status of excess body weight was the outcome variable which was categorized as ""yes (BMI≥24)"" or ""no (BMI<24)"" according to specific recommendations for Chinese adults. Residential density was the main explanatory variable which was grouped into tertiles. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) were calculated to assess the relationship between residential density and excess body weight using mixed-effects regression models after adjusting for age, sex, education, occupation, marital status, redmeat, smoking, physical activity, diabetic status and potential neighborhood-level clustering effect. Results A total of 1551 participants were recruited with a response rate of 98.9% (1551/1568). The mean age (standard deviation) of participants was 54.7 (11.1) years, and 46% of them were men. With adjustment for potential influential factors, participants in neighborhoods with lower (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.06–1.81) and middle (OR = 1. 29, 95% CI = 1. 01, 1. 64) tertile of residential density were at significantly higher risk of gaining excess body weight relative to their counterparts in communities with upper tertile of residential density. Such a negative association between residential density and excess body weight was observed for men only after stratified analysis by gender. Conclusions A negative association between residential density and excess body weight was identified in overall and male urban Chinese adults, and the association was independent of physical activity. Results of our study have important implications in guiding public health policy making regarding prevention of excess body weight at community level via establishment of health-friendly neighborhood environment in China."
https://openalex.org/W2957665860,"Background Abnormal uterine bleeding needs surgical treatment if medical therapy fails. After introduction of non-hysteroscopic endometrial ablation as alternative to hysteroscopic endometrial resection, we aimed to compare short and long-term outcomes for women treated with these two minimally-invasive procedures. A secondary goal was comparing the present cohort to a previous cohort of women treated with hysteroscopic resection only. Materials and methods Historical cohort study of women treated for abnormal uterine bleeding with hysteroscopic resection or endometrial ablation at Haukeland University Hospital during 2006–2014. Similar patient file and patient-reported outcome data were collected from 386 hysteroscopic resections in a previous cohort (1992–1998). Categorical variables were compared by Chi-square or Fisher´s Exact-test, linear variables by Mann-Whitney U-test and time to hysterectomy by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results During 2006–2014, 772 women were treated with endometrial resection or ablation, 468 women (61%) consented to study-inclusion; 333 women (71%) were treated with hysteroscopic resection and 135 (29%) with endometrial ablation. Preoperative characteristics were significantly different for women treated with hysteroscopic resection compared to endometrial ablation in the 2006-2014-cohort and between the two time-cohorts regarding menopausal, sterilization and myoma status (p≤0.036). The endometrial ablation group had significantly shorter operation time, median 13 minutes (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 12–14) and a lower complication rate (2%) versus operation time, median 25 minutes (95% CI 23–26) and complication rate (13%) in the hysteroscopy group, all p ≤0.001. The patient-reported rate of satisfaction with treatment was equivalent in both groups (85%, p = 0.955). The endometrial ablation group had lower hysterectomy rate (8% vs 16%, p = 0.024). Patient-reported satisfaction rate was higher (85%) in the 2006-2014-cohort compared with the 1992-1998-cohort (73%), p<0.001. Conclusions Endometrial ablation has similar patient satisfaction rate, but shorter operation time and lower complication rate and may be a good alternative to hysteroscopic resection for treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding."
https://openalex.org/W2959453568,"The purpose of this qualitative oral health needs assessment was to probe and better understand the oral health knowledge, beliefs, and barriers of District residents, particularly in DC wards where oral health disparities are most prevalent.Forty-eight (n = 48) participants were recruited for four focus groups. The focus group instrument consisted of a structured interview guide addressing the following topics: oral health history, perceived barriers to oral health, knowledge and perceptions about oral systemic health, and preferred message channels for receiving information on oral/dental health. Content analysis was performed using NVivo, a computerized, qualitative informatics tool.The majority of participants in this study practiced both brushing and flossing in their daily dental routine and did not believe that tooth loss is a normal part of ageing. There was lack of knowledge on the connection between oral and systemic health, specifically impact of smoking, alcohol use, and sweets and sexual activity. Focus groups identified two main barriers to healthcare access-communication and affordability. Participants who had a dentist were satisfied and felt that their needs were met.Our findings indicate a need for educational intervention and improved communication from oral health providers to increase awareness of the impact of systemic health and risky behaviors can have on oral health."
https://openalex.org/W2960937939,"Owing to the hierarchical organization of biology, from genomes over transcriptomes and proteomes down to metabolomes, there is continuous debate about the extent to which data and interpretations derived from one level, e.g. the transcriptome, are in agreement with other levels, e.g. the metabolome. Here, we tested the effect of ocean acidification (OA; 400 vs. 1000 μatm CO2) and its modulation by light intensity (50 vs. 300 μmol photons m-2 s-1) on the biomass composition (represented by 75 key metabolites) of diploid and haploid life-cycle stages of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (RCC1216 and RCC1217) and compared these data with interpretations from previous physiological and gene expression screenings. The metabolite patterns showed minor responses to OA in both life-cycle stages. Whereas previous gene expression analyses suggested that the observed increased biomass buildup derived from lipid and carbohydrate storage, this dataset suggests that OA slightly increases overall biomass of cells, but does not significantly alter their metabolite composition. Generally, light was shown to be a more dominant driver of metabolite composition than OA, increasing the relative abundances of amino acids, mannitol and storage lipids, and shifting pigment contents to accommodate increased irradiance levels. The diploid stage was shown to contain vastly more osmolytes and mannitol than the haploid stage, which in turn had a higher relative content of amino acids, especially aromatic ones. Besides the differences between the investigated cell types and the general effects on biomass buildup, our analyses indicate that OA imposes only negligible effects on E. huxleyi´s biomass composition."
https://openalex.org/W2956394890,"Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is given to newborns soon after birth. BCG vaccine overdose has been rarely reported. Here we report the outcome of newborns who accidently received high dose BCG at a tertiary care hospital, Karachi. We reviewed records of 26 newborns, who accidentally received intradermal high dose BCG, used for the treatment of urinary bladder cancers and 80 times higher dose than the BCG used for routine vaccination. The incident happened from 14-16th April, 2016 at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. Analysis was carried out using SPSS. A total of 23/26(88.5%) newborns were followed for atleast 3 months and 11/26 (42.3%) were followed for atleast one year. 13/26 (50%) were male. All 26 patients were prescribed isoniazid and rifampicin for 3 months. 3/26 (11.5%) were lost to follow-up before completion of anti-tuberculous drugs (ATT). Lesions at the BCG site were observed in 16/26 (61.5%) infants, of which 15 (93.8%) had a papule, 3 (18.8%) developed a pustule, 3 (18.8%) had skin induration and 2 (12.5%) had skin erythema. Axillary lymphadenopathy was observed in 1/26 (3.8%) patient. Coagulation was deranged in 3/26 (11.5%) of babies. Intracranial bleeding was observed in 1/26 (3.8%) case. Localized skin lesions were the most common adverse events. None of them developed clinical tuberculosis. Chemoprophylaxis for inadvertent high dose BCG administration should be given for atleast 3 months. Furthermore, vigilant follow-up, transparency and disclosure are the vital steps in the management of any medical error."
https://openalex.org/W2958393899,"Drug-induced liver damage characterized by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation often occurs in direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This study explored single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at drug metabolism- or transport-related genes that were associated with ALT elevation in asunaprevir plus daclatasvir therapy.Subjects were 185 Japanese patients with chronic HCV genotype 1b infection who received asunaprevir plus daclatasvir therapy. Tag SNPs at possible metabolizing enzyme and transporter genes, which were involved in the pharmacokinetics of asunaprevir and daclatasvir, were selected.Among the tag SNPs analyzed, CYP3A4 rs4646437 was significantly associated with ALT elevation (p = 0.013): maximum ALT values in patients with genotype CC were higher than those in patients with genotype non-CC (allele T). The proportion of grades 2-4 in genotype CC patients were significantly greater than those in genotype non-CC patients (p = 0.028). No patients with genotype non-CC showed grade ≥2 ALT elevation. In multivariate analysis, rs4646437 genotype CC and cirrhosis were significant, independent factors associated with grade ≥1 ALT elevation (odds ratio, 2.83 and 1.88; p = 0.040 and 0.045, respectively). In exploratory analyses, although serum concentrations of asunaprevir and daclatasvir were not correlated with maximum ALT values or rs4646437 genotypes, asunaprevir concentrations in patients with grade ≥1 ALT elevation were significantly higher than those in patients with grade <1 ALT elevation (P = 0.023).CYP3A4 rs4646437 was found to be significantly and independently associated with ALT elevation in Japanese patients receiving ASV plus DCV therapy. Notably, none of the patients with rs4646437 genotype non-CC (allele T) had grade ≥2 ALT elevation. SNP genotyping prior to treatment might be useful for carefully monitoring patients to complete treatment safely."
https://openalex.org/W2960967975,"Requirement for formation of collaborations has been on increase for the software development industry, especially for smaller to medium sized firms, due to rapid technological advancements, requirements for diversified skills, ever enhancing demands for innovation and fierce competition. Collaborative product development in an alliance enables the firms to benefit from each other’s diversified skills and the experience as a result of which they can develop products more rapidly and of better quality as well resulting in a higher payoff. Also, the development costs decrease. However, to avoid undesired results, selection of an appropriate partner firm for collaboration is of utmost importance keeping in view the objectives of alliance formation of both the strategic partners. One-way partner selection techniques available in the literature are impractical as they enable a firm to rank potential partners only from its own perspective while ignoring their objectives. This problem is addressed by the two-way partner selection techniques, however, they either ignore the payoff distribution criteria or the proposed criteria is unfair. More importantly, existing techniques consider that firm collaborate only with the objective to enhance their financial payoff which might not always be the case. The fact that collaborating firms may have one but different objectives for collaboration, or, each may have multiple objectives is largely neglected. To address the scenarios in which firms may collaborate due to multiple and possibly different objectives, this work proposes a bi-objective game-theoretic model that enables a firm to select an appropriate partner based on the individual preferences of both on the following two objectives: 1) learning and 2) financial revenue. Moreover, this model calculates the pay-off that each firm should get whether only monetary, only in the form of learning or both. The calculation of payoff share is based on the following parameters: 1) individual goals of collaboration of partner selecting firms on the said two objectives, 2) their level of cost contribution, 3) cooperation ratio and 4) knowledge investment difference. Comprehensive analysis of various scenarios is done for the proposed Nash Bargaining payoff distribution model to find the optimum strategy of collaborating firms for each scenario."
https://openalex.org/W2962265329,"People are connected by various social networks, resulting in the interdependence of consumer choice. Therefore, it is very important and realistic to assume choice interdependence in private car ownership modeling. In this paper, we investigate the interdependence of private car ownership choice using a spatial autoregressive binary probit model estimated by the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Constructing the autoregressive matrix demographically shows that the private car ownership choice of a household is dependent on other household choices. Compared with the pure binary probit model estimated by the MCMC method, the spatial autoregressive model achieves a significant improvement both in loglikelihood value and log marginal density value, which are calculated using the importance sampling method of Newton and Raftery, from approximately -202 to approximately -63 and from -208 to -145, respectively. Moreover, the results indicated by the spatial autoregressive probit model suggest that the number of children, the ownership of an apartment or the availability of a parking lot are positively and significantly associated with the private car ownership level. To test the out-of-sample performance of the model, we estimate the model using 600 data points and test it using another 148 data points. The results indicate that the predictive power is greatly improved. Finally, we analyze the augmented parameter and discover that it is associated with the parking variable in addition to the license variable."
https://openalex.org/W2957785734,"In epidemiology, gerontology, human development and the social sciences, age-period-cohort (APC) models are used to study the variability in trajectories of change over time. A well-known issue exists in simultaneously identifying age, period and birth cohort effects, namely that the three characteristics comprise a perfectly collinear system. That is, since age = period-cohort, only two of these effects are estimable at a time. In this paper, we introduce an alternative framework for considering effects relating to age, period and birth cohort. In particular, instead of directly modeling age in the presence of period and cohort effects, we propose a risk modeling approach to characterize age-related risk (i.e., a hybrid of multiple biological and sociological influences to evaluate phenomena associated with growing older). The properties of this approach, termed risk-period-cohort (RPC), are described in this paper and studied by simulations. We show that, except for pathological circumstances where risk is uniquely determined by age, using such risk indices obviates the problem of collinearity. We also show that the size of the chronological age effect in the risk prediction model associates with the correlation between a risk index and chronological age and that the RPC approach can satisfactorily recover cohort and period effects in most cases. We illustrate the advantages of RPC compared to traditional APC analysis on 27496 individuals from NHANES survey data (2005-2016) to study the longitudinal variability in depression screening over time. Our RPC method has broad implications for examining processes of change over time in longitudinal studies."
