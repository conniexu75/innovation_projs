https://openalex.org/W1965464747,"The energy costs associated with separating tightly bound excitons (photoinduced electron-hole pairs) and extracting free charges from highly disordered low-mobility networks represent fundamental losses for many low-cost photovoltaic technologies. We report a low-cost, solution-processable solar cell, based on a highly crystalline perovskite absorber with intense visible to near-infrared absorptivity, that has a power conversion efficiency of 10.9% in a single-junction device under simulated full sunlight. This ""meso-superstructured solar cell"" exhibits exceptionally few fundamental energy losses; it can generate open-circuit photovoltages of more than 1.1 volts, despite the relatively narrow absorber band gap of 1.55 electron volts. The functionality arises from the use of mesoporous alumina as an inert scaffold that structures the absorber and forces electrons to reside in and be transported through the perovskite."

Upon transplantation into testes, these PGCLCs can form fully functional sperm. Again working in mice, Hayashi et al. (p. 971 , published online 4 October) found that female ESCs and iPSCs can also differentiate into PGCLCs, which, when aggregated in reconstituted ovaries, exhibited epigenetic reprogramming and meiotic potential in vitro. Upon transplantation of the reconstituted ovaries under ovarian bursa, female PGCLCs developed into fully grown oocytes that contributed to healthy offspring upon in vitro maturation and fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2087387762,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasingly being recognized as a highly heterogeneous disorder, composed of varying pathobiology. Accurate detection of COPD subtypes by image biomarkers is urgently needed to enable individualized treatment, thus improving patient outcome. We adapted the parametric response map (PRM), a voxel-wise image analysis technique, for assessing COPD phenotype. We analyzed whole-lung computed tomography (CT) scans acquired at inspiration and expiration of 194 individuals with COPD from the COPDGene study. PRM identified the extent of functional small airways disease (fSAD) and emphysema as well as provided CT-based evidence that supports the concept that fSAD precedes emphysema with increasing COPD severity. PRM is a versatile imaging biomarker capable of diagnosing disease extent and phenotype while providing detailed spatial information of disease distribution and location. PRM's ability to differentiate between specific COPD phenotypes will allow for more accurate diagnosis of individual patients, complementing standard clinical techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2058235401,"To Die For The unfolded protein response (UPR) adjusts the protein folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to match demand. UPR signaling requires IRE1α, an ER transmembrane kinase-endoribonuclease (RNase) that becomes activated by unfolded protein accumulation within the ER and excises a segment in XBP1 messenger RNA (mRNA) to initiate production of the homeostatic transcription factor XBP1s. However, if ER stress is irremediable, sustained IRE1α RNase activity triggers cell death. Severe ER stress activates the protease Caspase-2 as an early apoptotic switch upstream of mitochondria. However, the molecular events leading from the detection of ER stress to Caspase-2 activation are unclear. Upton et al. (p. 818 , published online 4 October) now report that IRE1α is the ER stress sensor that activates Caspase-2, and does so through a mechanism involving non-coding RNAs. Under irremediable ER stress, IRE1α's RNase triggers the rapid decay of select microRNAs that normally repress translation of Caspase-2 mRNA, rapidly increasing Caspase-2 levels as the first step in its activation."
https://openalex.org/W2083456183,"Genetic programs function to integrate environmental sensors, implement signal processing algorithms and control expression dynamics. These programs consist of integrated genetic circuits that individually implement operations ranging from digital logic to dynamic circuits, and they have been used in various cellular engineering applications, including the implementation of process control in metabolic networks and the coordination of spatial differentiation in artificial tissues. A key limitation is that the circuits are based on biochemical interactions occurring in the confined volume of the cell, so the size of programs has been limited to a few circuits. Here we apply part mining and directed evolution to build a set of transcriptional AND gates in Escherichia coli. Each AND gate integrates two promoter inputs and controls one promoter output. This allows the gates to be layered by having the output promoter of an upstream circuit serve as the input promoter for a downstream circuit. Each gate consists of a transcription factor that requires a second chaperone protein to activate the output promoter. Multiple activator-chaperone pairs are identified from type III secretion pathways in different strains of bacteria. Directed evolution is applied to increase the dynamic range and orthogonality of the circuits. These gates are connected in different permutations to form programs, the largest of which is a 4-input AND gate that consists of 3 circuits that integrate 4 inducible systems, thus requiring 11 regulatory proteins. Measuring the performance of individual gates is sufficient to capture the behaviour of the complete program. Errors in the output due to delays (faults), a common problem for layered circuits, are not observed. This work demonstrates the successful layering of orthogonal logic gates, a design strategy that could enable the construction of large, integrated circuits in single cells."
https://openalex.org/W2053937911,"A high-throughput mutagenesis study in a PDZ domain shows that biochemical function and adaptation primarily originate from a collectively evolving amino acid network within the structure termed a protein sector. Statistical analysis of protein evolution suggests a 'design' for natural proteins in which sparse networks of coevolving amino acids comprise the essence of three-dimensional structure and function. To better understand the relationship of sector-based architecture to these properties, the authors performed a comprehensive single-mutation study of a PSD95pdz3 — a typical PDZ family protein — in which each position is substituted independently of every other amino acid. PDZ domains, which are made up of tens of amino acids, are conserved in many signalling proteins in animals, plants and other organisms. Mutational analysis showed that sector positions are functionally sensitive to mutation, whereas non-sector positions are much more tolerant to substitution, and that adaptation to a new binding specificity initiates exclusively through variation within sector residues. These results show how proteins can be robust yet also capable of rapid functional change when conditions of selection change. Statistical analysis of protein evolution suggests a design for natural proteins in which sparse networks of coevolving amino acids (termed sectors) comprise the essence of three-dimensional structure and function1,2,3,4,5. However, proteins are also subject to pressures deriving from the dynamics of the evolutionary process itself—the ability to tolerate mutation and to be adaptive to changing selection pressures6,7,8,9,10. To understand the relationship of the sector architecture to these properties, we developed a high-throughput quantitative method for a comprehensive single-mutation study in which every position is substituted individually to every other amino acid. Using a PDZ domain (PSD95pdz3) model system, we show that sector positions are functionally sensitive to mutation, whereas non-sector positions are more tolerant to substitution. In addition, we find that adaptation to a new binding specificity initiates exclusively through variation within sector residues. A combination of just two sector mutations located near and away from the ligand-binding site suffices to switch the binding specificity of PSD95pdz3 quantitatively towards a class-switching ligand. The localization of functional constraint and adaptive variation within the sector has important implications for understanding and engineering proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2166328287,"To evaluate evidence for de novo etiologies in schizophrenia, we sequenced at high coverage the exomes of families recruited from two populations with distinct demographic structures and history. We sequenced a total of 795 exomes from 231 parent-proband trios enriched for sporadic schizophrenia cases, as well as 34 unaffected trios. We observed in cases an excess of de novo nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants as well as a higher prevalence of gene-disruptive de novo mutations relative to controls. We found four genes (LAMA2, DPYD, TRRAP and VPS39) affected by recurrent de novo events within or across the two populations, which is unlikely to have occurred by chance. We show that de novo mutations affect genes with diverse functions and developmental profiles, but we also find a substantial contribution of mutations in genes with higher expression in early fetal life. Our results help define the genomic and neural architecture of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W1992078191,"The act of measurement bridges the quantum and classical worlds by projecting a superposition of possible states into a single, albeit probabilistic, outcome. The time-scale of this ""instantaneous"" process can be stretched using weak measurements so that it takes the form of a gradual random walk towards a final state. Remarkably, the interim measurement record is sufficient to continuously track and steer the quantum state using feedback. We monitor the dynamics of a resonantly driven quantum two-level system -- a superconducting quantum bit --using a near-noiseless parametric amplifier. The high-fidelity measurement output is used to actively stabilize the phase of Rabi oscillations, enabling them to persist indefinitely. This new functionality shows promise for fighting decoherence and defines a path for continuous quantum error correction."
https://openalex.org/W2163092257,"Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk3) supports mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by modulating Tcf3, but the critical targets downstream of Tcf3 are unclear. We analyzed the intersection between genome localization and transcriptome data sets to identify genes repressed by Tcf3. Among these, manipulations of Esrrb gave distinctive phenotypes in functional assays. Knockdown and knockout eliminated response to Gsk3 inhibition, causing extinction of pluripotency markers and loss of colony forming capability. Conversely, forced expression phenocopied Gsk3 inhibition or Tcf3 deletion by suppressing differentiation and sustaining self-renewal. Thus the nuclear receptor Esrrb is necessary and sufficient to mediate self-renewal downstream of Gsk3 inhibition. Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) regulates ESCs through Stat3, independently of Gsk3 inhibition. Consistent with parallel operation, ESCs in LIF accommodated Esrrb deletion and remained pluripotent. These findings highlight a key role for Esrrb in regulating the naive pluripotent state and illustrate compensation among the core pluripotency factors."

https://openalex.org/W2076612253,"Embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal efficiency is determined by the level of Nanog expression. However, the mechanisms by which Nanog functions remain unclear, and in particular, direct Nanog target genes are uncharacterized. Here we investigate ESCs expressing different Nanog levels and Nanog(-/-) cells with distinct functionally inducible Nanog proteins to identify Nanog-responsive genes. Surprisingly, these constitute a minor fraction of genes that Nanog binds. Prominent among Nanog-reponsive genes is Estrogen-related receptor b (Esrrb). Nanog binds directly to Esrrb, enhances binding of RNAPolII, and stimulates Esrrb transcription. Overexpression of Esrrb in ESCs maintains cytokine-independent self-renewal and pluripotency. Remarkably, this activity is retained in Nanog(-/-) ESCs. Moreover, Esrrb can reprogram Nanog(-/-) EpiSCs and can rescue stalled reprogramming in Nanog(-/-) pre-iPSCs. Finally, Esrrb deletion abolishes the defining ability of Nanog to confer LIF-independent ESC self-renewal. These findings are consistent with the functional placement of Esrrb downstream of Nanog."
https://openalex.org/W2084079308,"The authors selectively target a population of hippocampal interneurons called oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells with the Chrna2 promoter to demonstrate that these cells differentially modulate CA3 and entorhinal inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells. They also find that OLM cells receive fast cholinergic inputs, providing a plausible explanation for how nicotine affects hippocampal plasticity. The vast diversity of GABAergic interneurons is believed to endow hippocampal microcircuits with the required flexibility for memory encoding and retrieval. However, dissection of the functional roles of defined interneuron types has been hampered by the lack of cell-specific tools. We identified a precise molecular marker for a population of hippocampal GABAergic interneurons known as oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells. By combining transgenic mice and optogenetic tools, we found that OLM cells are important for gating the information flow in CA1, facilitating the transmission of intrahippocampal information (from CA3) while reducing the influence of extrahippocampal inputs (from the entorhinal cortex). Furthermore, we found that OLM cells were interconnected by gap junctions, received direct cholinergic inputs from subcortical afferents and accounted for the effect of nicotine on synaptic plasticity of the Schaffer collateral pathway. Our results suggest that acetylcholine acting through OLM cells can control the mnemonic processes executed by the hippocampus."

https://openalex.org/W2030038054,"The cell death of inhibitory neurons, which originate far from the cortical areas to which they migrate during embryonic development, is determined autonomously rather than by competition for trophic signals from other cell types. It has long been known that apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, eliminates young cells from developing tissues. In the field of neurobiology, it is widely believed that developmental neuronal-cell death results from cellular competition for environmentally derived survival signals that selects for an optimally sized and properly wired population of neurons. This study of developmental cell death in the mouse cortex in vivo, in vitro and after transplantation suggests that developmental neuronal-cell death is instead intrinsically determined for interneurons, the main inhibitory cells of the cerebral cortex. Cortical inhibitory circuits are formed by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-secreting interneurons, a cell population that originates far from the cerebral cortex in the embryonic ventral forebrain. Given their distant developmental origins, it is intriguing how the number of cortical interneurons is ultimately determined. One possibility, suggested by the neurotrophic hypothesis1,2,3,4,5, is that cortical interneurons are overproduced, and then after their migration into cortex the excess interneurons are eliminated through a competition for extrinsically derived trophic signals. Here we characterize the developmental cell death of mouse cortical interneurons in vivo, in vitro and after transplantation. We found that 40% of developing cortical interneurons were eliminated through Bax (Bcl-2-associated X)-dependent apoptosis during postnatal life. When cultured in vitro or transplanted into the cortex, interneuron precursors died at a cellular age similar to that at which endogenous interneurons died during normal development. Over transplant sizes that varied 200-fold, a constant fraction of the transplanted population underwent cell death. The death of transplanted neurons was not affected by the cell-autonomous disruption of TrkB (tropomyosin kinase receptor B), the main neurotrophin receptor expressed by neurons of the central nervous system6,7,8. Transplantation expanded the cortical interneuron population by up to 35%, but the frequency of inhibitory synaptic events did not scale with the number of transplanted interneurons. Taken together, our findings indicate that interneuron cell death is determined intrinsically, either cell-autonomously or through a population-autonomous competition for survival signals derived from other interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W1987618226,"Reprogramming of somatic cells into neurons provides a new approach toward cell-based therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. A major challenge for the translation of neuronal reprogramming into therapy is whether the adult human brain contains cell populations amenable to direct somatic cell conversion. Here we show that cells from the adult human cerebral cortex expressing pericyte hallmarks can be reprogrammed into neuronal cells by retrovirus-mediated coexpression of the transcription factors Sox2 and Mash1. These induced neuronal cells acquire the ability of repetitive action potential firing and serve as synaptic targets for other neurons, indicating their capability of integrating into neural networks. Genetic fate-mapping in mice expressing an inducible Cre recombinase under the tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase promoter corroborated the pericytic origin of the reprogrammed cells. Our results raise the possibility of functional conversion of endogenous cells in the adult human brain to induced neuronal fates."

The identification of CBC markers including Lgr5 has confirmed Leblond's predictions that CBC cells are anatomically distinct, long-lived stem cells that permanently cycle. While Potten originally described +4 cells as proliferative and unusually radiation-sensitive, recent efforts to identify +4 stem cells have focused on the identification of cells that are quiescent and radiation-resistant. Here, we describe commonalities and discrepancies between the individual studies and discuss challenges of marker-based lineage tracing."
https://openalex.org/W2164490896,"The accumulation of aggregated amyloid-β (Aβ) in amyloid plaques is a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reactive astrocytes are intimately associated with amyloid plaques; however, their role in AD pathogenesis is unclear. We deleted the genes encoding two intermediate filament proteins required for astrocyte activation—glial fibrillary acid protein (Gfap) and vimentin (Vim)—in transgenic mice expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 (APP/PS1). The gene deletions increased amyloid plaque load: APP/PS1 Gfap–/– Vim–/– mice had twice the plaque load of APP/PS1 Gfap+/+ Vim+/+ mice at 8 and 12 mo of age. APP expression and soluble and interstitial fluid Aβ levels were unchanged, suggesting that the deletions had no effect on APP processing or Aβ generation. Astrocyte morphology was markedly altered by the deletions: wild-type astrocytes had hypertrophied processes that surrounded and infiltrated plaques, whereas Gfap–/– Vim–/– astrocytes had little process hypertrophy and lacked contact with adjacent plaques. Moreover, Gfap and Vim gene deletion resulted in a marked increase in dystrophic neurites (2- to 3-fold higher than APP/PS1 Gfap+/+ Vim+/+ mice), even after normalization for amyloid load. These results suggest that astrocyte activation limits plaque growth and attenuates plaque-related dystrophic neurites. These activities may require intimate contact between astrocyte and plaque.—Kraft, A. W., Hu, X., Yoon, H., Yan, P., Xiao, Q., Wang, Y., Gil, S. C., Brown, J., Wilhelmsson, U., Restivo, J.

https://openalex.org/W2089780431,"Mitochondria are dynamic organelles whose function depends on intramitochondrial phospholipid synthesis and the supply of membrane lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum. How phospholipids are transported to and in-between mitochondrial membranes remained unclear. We identified Ups1, a yeast member of a conserved family of intermembrane space proteins, as a lipid transfer protein that can shuttle phosphatidic acid between mitochondrial membranes. Lipid transfer required the dynamic assembly of Ups1 with Mdm35 and allowed conversion of phosphatidic acid to cardiolipin in the inner membrane. High cardiolipin concentrations prevented membrane dissociation of Ups1, leading to its proteolysis and inhibiting transport of phosphatidic acid and cardiolipin synthesis. Thus, intramitochondrial lipid trafficking may involve a regulatory feedback mechanism that limits the accumulation of cardiolipin in mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2028256743,"In response to muscle injury, satellite cells activate the p38α/β MAPK pathway to exit quiescence, then proliferate, repair skeletal muscle, and self-renew, replenishing the quiescent satellite cell pool. Although satellite cells are capable of asymmetric division, the mechanisms regulating satellite cell self-renewal are not understood. We found that satellite cells, once activated, enter the cell cycle and a subset undergoes asymmetric division, renewing the satellite cell pool. Asymmetric localization of the Par complex activates p38α/β MAPK in only one daughter cell, inducing MyoD, which permits cell cycle entry and generates a proliferating myoblast. The absence of p38α/β MAPK signaling in the other daughter cell prevents MyoD induction, renewing the quiescent satellite cell. Thus, satellite cells employ a mechanism to generate distinct daughter cells, coupling the Par complex and p38α/β MAPK signaling to link the response to muscle injury with satellite cell self-renewal."
https://openalex.org/W2045565446,"Hundreds of stellar-mass black holes likely form in a typical globular star cluster, with all but one predicted to be ejected through dynamical interactions. Some observational support for this idea is provided by the lack of X-ray-emitting binary stars comprising one black hole and one other star (""black-hole/X-ray binaries"") in Milky Way globular clusters, even though many neutron-star/X-ray binaries are known. Although a few black holes have been seen in globular clusters around other galaxies, the masses of these cannot be determined, and some may be intermediate-mass black holes that form through exotic mechanisms. Here we report the presence of two flat-spectrum radio sources in the Milky Way globular cluster M22, and we argue that these objects are black holes of stellar mass (each ~ 10-20 times more massive than the Sun) that are accreting matter. We find a high ratio of radio-to-X-ray flux for these black holes, consistent with the larger predicted masses of black holes in globular clusters compared to those outside. The identification of two black holes in one cluster shows that the ejection of black holes is not as efficient as predicted by most models, and we argue that M22 may contain a total population of ~ 5-100 black holes. The large core radius of M22 could arise from heating produced by the black holes."
https://openalex.org/W1978034323,"The visualization of RNA conformational changes has provided fundamental insights into how regulatory RNAs carry out their biological functions. The RNA structural transitions that have been characterized so far involve long-lived species that can be captured by structure characterization techniques. Here we report the nuclear magnetic resonance visualization of RNA transitions towards 'invisible' excited states (ESs), which exist in too little abundance (2-13%) and for too short a duration (45-250 μs) to allow structural characterization by conventional techniques. Transitions towards ESs result in localized rearrangements in base-pairing that alter building block elements of RNA architecture, including helix-junction-helix motifs and apical loops. The ES can inhibit function by sequestering residues involved in recognition and signalling or promote ATP-independent strand exchange. Thus, RNAs do not adopt a single conformation, but rather exist in rapid equilibrium with alternative ESs, which can be stabilized by cellular cues to affect functional outcomes."

How this asymmetry is generated is currently unclear. Here, we demonstrate that asymmetric ISC division is established by a unique combination of extracellular and intracellular polarity mechanisms.

Cell-specific knockdown and overexpression experiments suggest that increased activity of aPKC enhances Delta/Notch signaling in one of the two daughter cells to induce terminal differentiation. Perturbing this mechanism or altering the orientation of ISC division results in the formation of intestinal tumors.

Much of what is known about how stem cells control this balance is derived from experiments done in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In Drosophila, neuroblasts and germline stem cells use distinct mechanisms of asymmetric cell division to generate cellular diversity. How asymmetric cell division is controlled in Drosophila adult somatic stem cells, however, is not understood. During development, neuroblasts undergo repeated rounds of asymmetric divisions, creating neurons in a highly stereotyped lineage (Doe, 2008Doe C.Q.

Germline stem cells, in contrast, divide throughout adulthood and depend on a secreted signal from the surrounding stem cell niche (Fuller and Spradling, 2007Fuller M.T. Spradling A.C.

During mitosis, the mitotic spindle is oriented so that after cell division, only one of the two daughter cells can maintain niche contact while the other cell loses contact and undergoes differentiation. When stem cells are lost, niche contacts become available and both daughter cells can retain a stem cell fate (Xie and Spradling, 2000Xie T. Spradling A.C.

Although this shows how Delta/Notch signaling influences cell fate choices in the adult Drosophila intestinal tract, the mechanism of how this is achieved remains unknown. Recent studies in the mammalian intestinal tract have demonstrated by lineage tracing that mammalian ISCs behave in a stochastic manner called neutral drift (Lopez-Garcia et al., 2010Lopez-Garcia C.

Intestinal stem cell replacement follows a pattern of neutral drift.Science. 2010; 330: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar; Snippert et al., 2010Snippert H.J. van der Flier L.G.

Intestinal crypt homeostasis results from neutral competition between symmetrically dividing Lgr5 stem cells.Cell. 2010; 143: 134-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Rather than cells dividing asymmetrically to generate daughter cells of a different cell fate, the mammalian intestinal epithelium is composed of stem cells that divide symmetrically. This leads to neutral competition within the equipotent stem cell population in the intestinal crypt whereby the stochastic loss of a stem cell results in its replacement and clonal expansion from its neighboring one, which eventually leads to crypt monoclonality (Lopez-Garcia et al., 2010Lopez-Garcia C.

Intestinal stem cell replacement follows a pattern of neutral drift.Science. 2010; 330: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar; Snippert et al., 2010Snippert H.J. van der Flier L.G.

Intestinal crypt homeostasis results from neutral competition between symmetrically dividing Lgr5 stem cells.Cell. 2010; 143: 134-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). This has lead to the proposal that stem cells are likely to use either an extrinsic or a neutral drift mechanism to maintain homeostasis during adulthood whereas the invariant cell-intrinsic asymmetric divisions are restricted to periods during development (Simons and Clevers, 2011Simons B.D. Clevers H.

Simons B.D. Universal patterns of stem cell fate in cycling adult tissues.Development. 2011; 138: 3103-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Here, we analyze the mechanism that controls cell fate diversity in the adult Drosophila ISC lineage. We demonstrate that ISCs divide using an intrinsic polarity whereby the evolutionary conserved Par complex localizes asymmetrically to the apical daughter cell. Through aPKC activity, this promotes a differentiated cell fate. The apical localization of the Par complex, mitotic spindle orientation, and control of ISC proliferation are dependent on Integrins, indicating that ISCs use a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms to regulate ISC self-renewal. Our data show that adult somatic stem cells can adopt a mechanism that regulates the localization of cell-intrinsic polarity to influence the outcome of cell lineages required in adult tissues. ISCs reside within an epithelial monolayer formed by the ECs with an underlying basement membrane, which is further surrounded by a visceral muscle sheath (Figure 1A) (Baumann, 2001Baumann O.

Cell Res. 2001; 270: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar; Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006Ohlstein B. Spradling A.

Perrimon N. Evidence that stem cells reside in the adult Drosophila midgut epithelium.Nature. 2006; 439: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). It has been previously described that ISCs divide asymmetrically to generate one self-renewing ISC and one differentiating EB (Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007Ohlstein B. Spradling A. Multipotent Drosophila intestinal stem cells specify daughter cell fates by differential notch signaling.Science. 2007; 315: 988-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar; O’Brien et al., 2011O’Brien L.E. Soliman S.S. Li X. Bilder D. Altered modes of stem cell division drive adaptive intestinal growth.Cell. 2011; 147: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In Drosophila neuroblasts, the asymmetric segregation of specific cell fate determinants specifies an invariant stem cell lineage in which one cell will always remain a neuroblast while the other will differentiate. To determine the proportion of divisions where asymmetric cell fates are established in the ISC lineage, we analyzed lineage markers in cells that recently underwent mitosis. The Notch ligand Delta specifically marks ISCs while the EB is active for Notch and therefore expresses Su(H)GBE Gal4 > UAS-CD8::GFP (Figures 1B and Figures S1A and S1B available online) (Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007Ohlstein B. Spradling A.

Chauhan C. Hou S.X. Characterization of midgut stem cell- and enteroblast-specific Gal4 lines in drosophila.Genesis. 2010; 48: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Assuming that all recent divisions form cell doublets, we were able to unambiguously distinguish EB and ISC fate in the two daughter cells. Although with slight discrepancies from previous studies (O’Brien et al., 2011O’Brien L.E. Soliman S.S. Li X. Bilder D. Altered modes of stem cell division drive adaptive intestinal growth.Cell. 2011; 147: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), we found that approximately 79% of the divisions (Figure 1C, n = 137) resulted in asymmetric cell fate (ISC/EB) whereas symmetric self-renewal (ISC/ISC) and differentiation (EB/EB) was observed in approximately only 8% and 13% of the divisions, respectively. Consistent with this, we also observed similar results from clonal analysis on two-cell pairs (Figure S1C, n = 10). To further characterize the ISC lineage, we conducted a clonal analysis to analyze the cell populations produced over time. In 4–5 day positively marked clones, we observed clonal sizes ranging from typically 2–11 cells (data not shown). The majority of these clones (about 61%) contained only a single Delta-positive cell (Figure 1D, n = 33 cell clones in total) while only few clones had two or no Delta-positive cells. Together, this indicates that the majority of ISCs undergo an asymmetric cell division in terms of cell fate. Unlike neuroblasts, however, ISCs have the flexibility to also divide symmetrically and to generate two daughter cells of the same fate. Asymmetric cell division can be orchestrated either by intrinsic cell polarity or by extrinsic environmental cues. To address the relevance of intrinsic polarity, we next looked at how the intestinal epithelium is polarized. The apical membrane of the intestinal epithelium faces the gut lumen. Interestingly, we observed that the septate junction marker Discs-large (Dlg) localizes apicolaterally (Figures S1D and S1E) while the Drosophila β-Catenin homolog Armadillo, which marks adherens junctions, is located basolaterally (Figures S1F and S1G) (Baumann, 2001Baumann O. Posterior midgut epithelial cells differ in their organization of the membrane skeleton from other drosophila epithelia.Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 270: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the epithelial characteristics of the Drosophila adult midgut are distinct from other established epithelia, and polarity complexes may function differently in this tissue. Asymmetric cell division in neuroblasts is oriented by the apical Par complex consisting of the PDZ domain proteins Baz and Par-6 and the kinase aPKC (Wodarz et al., 1999Wodarz A. Ramrath A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1361-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To ask whether the Par complex is expressed in ISCs, we analyzed the endogenous localization for Baz and aPKC and used a functional GFP-tagged genomic rescue construct in a par-6 null mutant background for Par-6 (Wirtz-Peitz et al., 2008Wirtz-Peitz F. Nishimura T. Knoblich J.A. Linking cell cycle to asymmetric division: Aurora-A phosphorylates the Par complex to regulate Numb localization.Cell. 2008; 135: 161-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In the midgut, all members of the Par complex were expressed in small, basal cells that often, but not always, are in doublets (Figures 1E, S1F, and S1G). Furthermore, transverse sections through the intestinal epithelium reveal that within these small cells, all the Par complex members localize in a polarized fashion apically (Figures 1E and S1G). Staining for the ISC marker Delta and ee marker Pros shows that these cells are ISCs and EBs (Figure 1F). In Delta-positive interphase ISCs, Par-6 (Figure 1G) and Baz (Figure 1K) are apically enriched, and in mitotic ISCs, Par-6 (Figures 1H and 1I, 85% apical asymmetry, n = 33 anaphase/telophase cells), Baz (Figure 1L, 84% apical asymmetry, n = 31 prophase-telophase cells), and aPKC (Figure 1M, 78% apical asymmetry, n = 9 prophase-telophase cells) are concentrated in the cortical area overlying the apical centrosome. Similar observations were made during mitosis when we overexpressed Baz::GFP (Figure S1H). After division, it is inherited by the apical daughter cell, which will become the EB. Interestingly, in a small fraction of ISC divisions, we found mislocalization (Figure 1J, 15% mislocalized/symmetric, n = 33 anaphase/telophase cells) of the Par complex, which is consistent with what we observed in cell fate asymmetry in cells that have recently undergone mitosis (Figure 1C). Thus, ISCs display a cell-intrinsic polarity that might be similar to the one observed in neuroblasts. In neuroblasts, aPKC phosphorylates Numb and Miranda, leading to their basal accumulation and their segregation into the basal daughter cell (Atwood and Prehoda, 2009Atwood S.X.

Linking cell cycle to asymmetric division: Aurora-A phosphorylates the Par complex to regulate Numb localization.Cell. 2008; 135: 161-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Using a Numb::GFP fusion protein containing the PTB domain and all sequences necessary for asymmetric localization (NumbPTB::GFP) (Roegiers et al., 2001Roegiers F. Younger-Shepherd S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Two types of asymmetric divisions in the Drosophila sensory organ precursor cell lineage.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether aPKC exhibits kinase activity during mitosis in ISCs. NumbPTB::GFP is uniformly cortical in interphase (Figure S1I), but it concentrates over the basal centrosome in prometa (Figure S1J) and metaphase (Figure S1K) so that it is segregated into the future stem cell upon division (Figure S1L, 79% basal asymmetry, n = 19 metaphase-two cell stage). Upon inhibition of the aPKC binding partner Par-6 by RNAi or upon overexpression of the constitutively active membrane-tethered form of aPKC (aPKC-CAAX), NumbPTB::GFP becomes uniformly cortical (Figure S1M, 69% symmetric localization, n = 13 metaphase-telophase cells) or is mislocalized into the cytoplasm (Figure S1N, n = 9 metaphase-telophase cells), respectively. This mislocalization is not seen in a kinase-dead version of aPKC-CAAX (aPKC-CAAXKD), indicating that aPKC kinase activity is required for the asymmetric localization of NumbPTB::GFP in the ISCs (Figure S1O, n = 16 prometaphase-two cell stage). In neuroblasts, loss of numb function results in overproliferation and tumor formation (Lee et al., 2006aLee C.Y. Andersen R.O. Cabernard C. Manning L. Tran K.D. Lanskey M.J. Bashirullah A. Doe C.Q. Drosophila Aurora-A kinase inhibits neuroblast self-renewal by regulating aPKC/Numb cortical polarity and spindle orientation.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar; Wang et al., 2006Wang H. Somers G.W. Bashirullah A. Heberlein U. Yu F. Chia W. Aurora-A acts as a tumor suppressor and regulates self-renewal of Drosophila neuroblasts.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3453-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In ISCs, however, we were unable to detect asymmetrically localized endogenous Numb protein by immunofluorescence (data not shown). Furthermore, consistent with previous data (Bardin et al., 2010Bardin A.J. Perdigoto C.N. Southall T.D. Brand A.H. Schweisguth F. Transcriptional control of stem cell maintenance in the Drosophila intestine.Development. 2010; 137: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we did not detect any striking lineage phenotype in numb mutant ISCs (data not shown). As the asymmetric localization of Numb is known to depend on direct phosphorylation by aPKC, these data suggest that aPKC is active in mitotic ISCs. Unlike in neuroblasts, however, the asymmetric segregation of Numb does not seem to be a major downstream target of aPKC in ISCs. To determine the function of the Par complex, we utilized the Temporal and Regional Gene Expression Targeting (TARGET) system to spatially and temporally regulate RNAi knockdown in ISCs and EBs using the escargot (esg) Gal4 driver (McGuire et al., 2003McGuire S.E. Le P.T. Osborn A.J. Matsumoto K. Davis R.L. Spatiotemporal rescue of memory dysfunction in Drosophila.Science. 2003; 302: 1765-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). The functionality of the RNAi lines was confirmed in neuroblasts and in the adult midgut (Figures S2A–S2J). In a control midgut, stem cells exist individually or (rarely) as doublets, together with their daughter EB cell (Figures 2A and 2E ). Upon silencing of Baz, Par-6, or aPKC, we observed an increase of small esg-positive cells, which are therefore ISCs and/or EBs (Figures 2A–2D). Some of these cells are mitotically active (anti-phospho H3-positive, arrows Figure 2B) and form small tumor-like clusters that are positive for the stem cell marker Delta (Figures 2F–2H and 2M). Interestingly, we also occasionally observed clustering in small groups of Pros-positive ee cells (Figure 2G, asterisk), similar to the Notch loss-of-function phenotypes previously described (Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006Micchelli C.A. Perrimon N. Evidence that stem cells reside in the adult Drosophila midgut epithelium.Nature. 2006; 439: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar; Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006Ohlstein B. Spradling A. The adult Drosophila posterior midgut is maintained by pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Overproliferation phenotypes were confirmed using alternative secondary/tertiary RNAi lines (Figures S2K–S2O). This is further supported by the increased size of par-6 or baz mutant clones (Figure S2P). The number of Delta-positive cells was increased in those clones (data not shown). Of note, we also observed an increase in Delta-positive cells outside the clones, which could be explained by the slight dominant phenotype that was seen in the stocks used to generate the clones (data not shown). Although non-cell-autonomous effects cannot be completely excluded, the basolateral localization of Arm upon knockdown of Par-6 was unaffected (Figure S2Q), thus indicating that the phenotype does not arise from defects in epithelial polarity. To test whether the Par complex is required in ISCs, we made use of Delta Gal4, which is specifically expressed in ISCs, combined with the TARGET system (Zeng et al., 2010Zeng X. Chauhan C. Hou S.X. Characterization of midgut stem cell- and enteroblast-specific Gal4 lines in drosophila.Genesis. 2010; 48: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consistent with the knockdown effects seen using esg Gal4, expression of Baz, Par-6, or aPKC RNAi constructs specifically in the ISCs resulted in a similar increase in Delta-positive ISCs (Figures 2I–2L and 2N). Thus, silencing of the Par complex in the ISCs leads to the increase in undifferentiated cells in the Drosophila intestinal epithelium. To ask whether the segregation of the Par complex into the differentiating daughter cell limits self-renewal capacity, we expressed aPKC-CAAX. In neuroblasts, aPKC-CAAX promotes self-renewal in both daughter cells and induces the formation of stem-cell-derived tumors (Lee et al., 2006bLee C.Y. Robinson K.J. Doe C.Q. Lgl, Pins and aPKC regulate neuroblast self-renewal versus differentiation.Nature. 2006; 439: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, aPKC-CAAX expression in ISCs actually inhibits self-renewal capacity (Figures 2O–2S). Sixty percent of 4- to 5-day-old nuclear β-Galactosidase marked clones overexpressing aPKC-CAAX contain four or fewer cells while such low cell numbers are only observed in fifteen percent of the control clones (Figure 2O). Staining for the ee marker Pros reveals that in 46% (n = 37) of these clones, stem cells are lost and all cells have differentiated into polyploid ECs that can be uniquely identified by their large nuclear morphology (Figures 2P–2S). Upregulation of Delta/Notch signaling results in the differentiation of ISCs into EBs (Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006Micchelli C.A. Perrimon N. Evidence that stem cells reside in the adult Drosophila midgut epithelium.Nature. 2006; 439: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar; Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006Ohlstein B. Spradling A.

https://openalex.org/W2002189052,"How cells form global, self-organized structures using genetically encoded molecular rules remains elusive. Here, we take a synthetic biology approach to investigate the design principles governing cell polarization. First, using a coarse-grained computational model, we searched for all possible simple networks that can achieve polarization. All solutions contained one of three minimal motifs: positive feedback, mutual inhibition, or inhibitor with positive feedback. These minimal motifs alone could achieve polarization under limited conditions; circuits that combined two or more of these motifs were significantly more robust. With these design principles as a blueprint, we experimentally constructed artificial polarization networks in yeast, using a toolkit of chimeric signaling proteins that spatially direct the synthesis and degradation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP(3)). Circuits with combinatorial motifs yielded clear foci of synthetic PIP(3) that can persist for nearly an hour. Thus, by harnessing localization-regulated signaling molecules, we can engineer simple molecular circuits that reliably execute spatial self-organized programs."
https://openalex.org/W2117074250,"On the Receiving End One type of neuron, the hippocampal pyramidal neuron, forms two different types of synapses with two different downstream partners. When the partner is an oriens-lacunosum moleculare (O-LM) interneuron, the pyramidal neuron only releases its synaptic vesicles with a low probability. When the cell on the receiving end is a parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneuron, the likelihood of synaptic vesicle release is high. How can the postsynaptic cell change the release characteristics of the presynaptic cell? Sylwestrak and Ghosh (p. 536 , published online 4 October; see the Perspective by McBain ) describe how the extracellular leucine-rich repeat fibronectin containing 1 (Elfn1) protein in the postsynaptic OLM interneurons affects vesicle release probability in the presynaptic pyramidal neuron. Misexpression of Elfn1 in PV interneurons converted vesicle release to the OLM pattern. Thus, a regulator located in the postsynaptic cell can modulate the function of the synapse."

A genetic bottleneck explains the marked changes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy that are observed during the transmission of pathogenic mutations, but the precise timing of these changes remains controversial, and it is not clear whether selection has a role. These issues are important for the genetic counseling of prospective mothers and for the development of treatments aimed at disease prevention. By studying mice transmitting a heteroplasmic single-base-pair deletion in the mitochondrial tRNAMet gene, we show that the extent of mammalian mtDNA heteroplasmy is principally determined prenatally within the developing female germline. Although we saw no evidence of mtDNA selection prenatally, skewed heteroplasmy levels were observed in the offspring of the next generation, consistent with purifying selection. High percentages of mtDNA genomes with the tRNAMet mutation were linked to a compensatory increase in overall mitochondrial RNA levels, ameliorating the biochemical phenotype and explaining why fecundity is not compromised."
https://openalex.org/W1996759306,"The pancreatic lineage is used as a model for embryonic-stem-cell differentiation, and shows that co-culture with organ-matched mesenchyme permits proliferation and self-renewal of progenitors, enabling an expansion of more than a million-fold for human endodermal cells with full retention of developmental potential. For stem cells to be of use in regenerative medicine they need to be available in quantity. Douglas Melton and colleagues now amplify pancreatic progenitor cells by co-culturing them with organ-matched mesenchyme, which acts as a self-renewal signal. They achieve a 65-million-fold expansion of human endodermal progenitors, retaining full developmental potential. This work paves the way for the efficient production of cell types such as insulin-secreting β-cells for therapeutic use. One goal of regenerative medicine, to use stem cells to replace cells lost by injury or disease, depends on producing an excess of the relevant cell for study or transplantation. To this end, the stepwise differentiation of stem cells into specialized derivatives has been successful for some cell types1,2,3, but a major problem remains the inefficient conversion of cells from one stage of differentiation to the next. If specialized cells are to be produced in large numbers it will be necessary to expand progenitor cells, without differentiation, at some steps of the process. Using the pancreatic lineage as a model for embryonic-stem-cell differentiation, we demonstrate that this is a solvable problem. Co-culture with organ-matched mesenchyme permits proliferation and self-renewal of progenitors, without differentiation, and enables an expansion of more than a million-fold for human endodermal cells with full retention of their developmental potential. This effect is specific both to the mesenchymal cell and to the progenitor being amplified. Progenitors that have been serially expanded on mesenchyme give rise to glucose-sensing, insulin-secreting cells when transplanted in vivo. Theoretically, the identification of stage-specific renewal signals can be incorporated into any scheme for the efficient production of large numbers of differentiated cells from stem cells and may therefore have wide application in regenerative biology."
https://openalex.org/W2003077172,"Persistent activity can mediate working memory during behavior. Here, the authors report persistent activity during sleep, occurring spontaneously in medial entorhinal cortex layer III (MECIII) neurons' membrane potential. This persistent activity excited hippocampal CA1 neurons. Thus, persistent activity in MECIII contributes to cortico-hippocampal interaction, which could serve several important mnemonic functions. Persistent activity is thought to mediate working memory during behavior. Can it also occur during sleep? We found that the membrane potential of medial entorhinal cortex layer III (MECIII) neurons, a gateway between neocortex and hippocampus, showed spontaneous, stochastic persistent activity in vivo in mice during Up-Down state oscillations (UDS). This persistent activity was locked to the neocortical Up states with a short delay, but persisted over several cortical UDS cycles. Lateral entorhinal neurons did not show substantial persistence, and current injections similar to those used in vitro failed to elicit persistence in vivo, implicating network mechanisms. Hippocampal CA1 neurons' spiking activity was reduced during neocortical Up states, but was increased during MECIII persistent states. These results provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first direct evidence for persistent activity in MECIII neurons in vivo and reveal its contribution to cortico-hippocampal interaction that could be involved in working memory and learning of long behavioral sequences during behavior, and memory consolidation during sleep."

The origin of HSCs within the AGM and the process of their generation have been the matter of intense debate over the past decade; however, recent findings have started to shed some light on these issues (for a recent review, see Ottersbach et al., 2010Ottersbach K. Smith A. Wood A. Göttgens B. Ontogeny of haematopoiesis: recent advances and open questions.Br. J. Haematol. 2010; 148: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Originally, two seemingly conflicting theories were put forward of either an endothelial (Jaffredo et al., 1998Jaffredo T. Gautier R. Eichmann A. Dieterlen-Lièvre F. Intraaortic hemopoietic cells are derived from endothelial cells during ontogeny.Development. 1998; 125: 4575-4583PubMed Google Scholar, Jaffredo et al., 2000Jaffredo T. Gautier R. Brajeul V.

Cumano A. Characterization of purified intraembryonic hematopoietic stem cells as a tool to define their site of origin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) precursor cell for HSCs. Recent lineage tracing experiments have reported the existence of hemogenic endothelial cells in the mouse AGM that contribute to the production of definitive blood both in the embryo and in the adult (Chen et al., 2009Chen M.J. Yokomizo T. Zeigler B.M. Dzierzak E. Speck N.A.

However, there is also evidence for the existence of an early subaortic mesenchymal population that expresses smooth muscle cell markers and that contributes to blood formation via an endothelial intermediate, thus providing a possible link between the two original hypotheses (Rybtsov et al., 2011Rybtsov S. Sobiesiak M. Taoudi S. Souilhol C. Senserrich J. Liakhovitskaia A. Ivanovs A. Frampton J. Zhao S. Medvinsky A.

There is also recent evidence that the yolk sac may contribute to HSC precursors (Samokhvalov et al., 2007Samokhvalov I.M. Samokhvalova N.I. Nishikawa S. Cell tracing shows the contribution of the yolk sac to adult haematopoiesis.Nature. 2007; 446: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar; Tanaka et al., 2012Tanaka Y. Hayashi M. Kubota Y.

USA. 2012; 109: 4515-4520Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Progress has also been made in defining the components that make up the hematopoietic regulatory microenvironment of the AGM. Cells with characteristics of mesenchymal stromal cells, which are known to be crucial elements in the adult HSC niche, have been identified in the AGM (Mendes et al., 2005Mendes S.C. Robin C. Dzierzak E. Mesenchymal progenitor cells localize within hematopoietic sites throughout ontogeny.Development. 2005; 132: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and AGM-derived stromal cell lines have proven to be a powerful tool for the identification of environmental HSC regulators (Durand et al., 2007Durand C. Robin C. Bollerot K. Baron M.H. Ottersbach K. Dzierzak E. Embryonic stromal clones reveal developmental regulators of definitive hematopoietic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Furthermore, it was demonstrated that tissues ventral to the AGM have an enhancing effect on HSC emergence, while tissues on the dorsal side decrease HSC production (Peeters et al., 2009Peeters M. Ottersbach K. Bollerot K. Orelio C. de Bruijn M. Wijgerde M. Dzierzak E.

USA. 2007; 104: 9399-9403Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), pointing to the important concept that HSC generation in the AGM occurs in the wider context of the tissues that develop around it. We have recently carried out microarray expression analyses of the AGM region with the aim of identifying HSC regulators (Mascarenhas et al., 2009Mascarenhas M.I. Parker A. Dzierzak E. Ottersbach K. Identification of novel regulators of hematopoietic stem cell development through refinement of stem cell localization and expression profiling.Blood. 2009; 114: 4645-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition to known hematopoiesis-associated genes, upregulation of genes known to be involved in the development of tissues surrounding the aorta was also noted, again suggesting that HSC emergence is functionally linked to other developmental processes that proceed in the vicinity of the dorsal aorta. Among the upregulated genes was the transcription factor Gata3, which is involved in the development of a number of cell and tissue types, including skin, mammary gland, kidney, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and adipocytes (Asselin-Labat et al., 2007Asselin-Labat M.L.

Within the hematopoietic system, Gata3 has been linked to the development of T cells (Ting et al., 1996Ting C.N. Olson M.C. Barton K.P. Leiden J.M.

Moreover, Gata3 expression was reported in embryonic and adult HSCs (Benveniste et al., 2010Benveniste P. Frelin C. Janmohamed S. Barbara M. Herrington R. Hyam D. Iscove N.N.

Targeted disruption of the GATA3 gene causes severe abnormalities in the nervous system and in fetal liver haematopoiesis.Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). More recently, two groups have confirmed Gata3 expression in adult HSCs and have examined a possible role for Gata3 in adult HSC function. While Buza-Vidas et al. have found no effect of a panhematopoietic Gata3 deletion on the ability of HSCs to long-term repopulate and self-renew (Buza-Vidas et al., 2011Buza-Vidas N. Duarte S. Luc S. Bouriez-Jones T. Woll P.S. Jacobsen S.E. GATA3 is redundant for maintenance and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 2011; 118: 1291-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), Ku et al., using a complete Gata3 null line and an adult hematopoiesis- and bone-marrow-niche-specific Gata3 knockout, reported that Gata3 is required for adult HSC maintenance via regulation of cell cycle entry (Ku et al., 2012Ku C.J. Hosoya T. Maillard I. Engel J.D. GATA-3 regulates hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and cell-cycle entry.Blood. 2012; 119: 2242-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Considering the reported role of Gata3 in the hematopoietic system and its importance in the development of various other tissues, we hypothesized that it may also be involved in the generation of the first HSCs, especially since we previously found Gata3 to be upregulated in the E11 AGM. We therefore analyzed Gata3-deficient embryos and detected a marked reduction in functional and phenotypic HSCs in the AGM. Surprisingly, this was largely independent of a cell-intrinsic role of Gata3, but was secondary to its function in the developing SNS, thus providing an example of a molecular defect in an adjacent tissue having a profound impact on HSC production in the dorsal aorta. To determine if Gata3 plays a role in the emergence of HSCs, we analyzed the repopulation activity of AGMs from Gata3 knockout embryos in transplantation assays. When E11–11.5 AGMs were dissected from Gata3+/+, Gata3+/−, and Gata3−/− embryos and directly transplanted into adult recipients, a marked reduction in the repopulation ability of Gata3+/− and Gata3−/− AGMs was observed (Table 1 and Figure S1 available online). While almost 60% of mice transplanted with wild-type AGM cells showed more than 10% donor contribution to their peripheral blood, less than 20% of mice were repopulated by Gata3+/− and Gata3−/− AGM-derived HSCs. In fact, only one mouse out of seven injected with Gata3−/− AGM cells had detectable levels of donor contribution, and these did not exceed 10%, even after more than 4 months. Placing E11 AGMs into whole-organ explant culture for 3 days prior to transplantation allowed HSC activity in heterozygous AGMs to recover to that of wild-type levels, while the defect remained in Gata3 null AGMs (Table 1 and Figure S1). These results suggest that reduced levels of Gata3 impair the emergence and/or expansion of HSCs in the AGM.Table 1Effect of Gata3 Deletion on AGM HSC NumbersGenotypeNumber of Mice Repopulated/Total TransplantedMice Reconstituted (%)Chimerism (%)Direct transplantationaAGMs from Gata3+/+, Gata3+/−, or Gata3−/− E11 embryos were dissociated with collagenase treatment and directly transplanted as one tissue per recipient (1 embryo equivalent [ee]) into irradiated adult recipients.Gata3+/+7/12(58)11–89Gata3+/−4/23(17)26–85Gata3−/−1/7(14)10After explantbAGMs from Gata3+/+, Gata3+/−, or Gata3−/− E11 embryos were cultured as explants for 3 days before being dissociated and transplanted (as 1 ee) into irradiated adult recipients.Gata3+/+4/9(44)11–100Gata3+/−10/17(59)11–75Gata3−/−1/7(14)28The percentage of chimerism was determined by semiquantitative PCR.

Open table in a new tab The percentage of chimerism was determined by semiquantitative PCR. See also Figure S1. HSC production in the AGM initiates at E10.5 (Müller et al., 1994Müller A.M. Medvinsky A. Strouboulis J. Grosveld F. Dzierzak E. Development of hematopoietic stem cell activity in the mouse embryo.Immunity. 1994; 1: 291-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). However, numbers of HSCs are limited at that time point, making an accurate comparison of HSCs in E10.5 wild-type or Gata3-deficient AGMs by direct transplantations impossible. We therefore analyzed the number of immature late-developing colony-forming units-spleen (CFU-S11) progenitors (Figure S1). While all of the wild-type and heterozygous E10.5 AGMs contained CFU-S11 cells, only three out of eight injected Gata3−/− AGMs produced spleen colonies in the recipients. Moreover, in those three AGMs, the frequency of CFU-S11 cells was less than half of that observed in Gata3+/+ and Gata3+/− E10.5 AGMs. This implies that Gata3 plays a role in the production of hematopoietic progenitors and the first HSCs that emerge in the midgestation embryo. To analyze HSCs phenotypically, we crossed the Gata3 knockout line with the Ly-6A GFP transgenic mouse line, which expresses the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the regulatory elements of the HSC marker Sca1 and which was previously shown to mark all HSCs in the AGM (de Bruijn et al., 2002de Bruijn M.F. Ma X. Robin C. Ottersbach K. Sanchez M.J. Dzierzak E. Hematopoietic stem cells localize to the endothelial cell layer in the midgestation mouse aorta.Immunity. 2002; 16: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Sections were prepared from Gata3+/+ GFP+ and Gata3−/− GFP+ embryos along the whole length of the AGM region, and the number of GFP+ cells within the endothelial layer of the dorsal aorta was counted on every tenth section. This method was previously used to highlight a reduction in phenotypic HSCs in Gata2+/− embryos (Ling et al., 2004Ling K.W. Ottersbach K. van Hamburg J.P. Oziemlak A. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Ploemacher R. Hendriks R.W. Dzierzak E. GATA-2 plays two functionally distinct roles during the ontogeny of hematopoietic stem cells.J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In three independent experiments, we found a 2- to 3-fold reduction in the percentage of Ly-6A GFP+ cells within the endothelium of E10.5 and E11.5 Gata3−/− aortae (Figures 1A–1C). The total number of endothelial cells was not affected by the Gata3 deficiency (data not shown). Representative sections are shown in Figures 1A and 1B. These results suggest that Gata3 deletion results in fewer phenotypic HSCs and possibly also a reduction in hemogenic endothelial cells, which are also thought to express the Ly-6A GFP transgene (de Bruijn et al., 2002de Bruijn M.F. Ma X. Robin C. Ottersbach K. Sanchez M.J. Dzierzak E. Hematopoietic stem cells localize to the endothelial cell layer in the midgestation mouse aorta.Immunity. 2002; 16: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We also examined the presence and morphology of intra-aortic clusters, which are believed to be signs of HSC emergence in the dorsal aorta. Sections from E11 Gata3+/+ and Gata3−/− embryos were stained for the expression of the transcription factor growth factor independence 1 (Gfi1), which is known to be expressed in adult HSCs and to be required for their maintenance (Hock et al., 2004Hock H. Hamblen M.J. Rooke H.M. Schindler J.W. Saleque S. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Gfi-1 restricts proliferation and preserves functional integrity of haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2004; 431: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar; Khandanpour et al., 2010Khandanpour C.

Evidence that growth factor independence 1b regulates dormancy and peripheral blood mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 2010; 116: 5149-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Figure 1D shows that Gfi1 is strongly and specifically expressed in the intra-aortic clusters of E11 wild-type embryos, as reported previously (Wilson et al., 2010Wilson N.K. Timms R.T. Kinston S.J. Cheng Y.H. Oram S.H. Landry J.R. Mullender J. Ottersbach K. Gottgens B. Gfi1 expression is controlled by five distinct regulatory regions spread over 100 kilobases, with Scl/Tal1, Gata2, PU.1, Erg, Meis1, and Runx1 acting as upstream regulators in early hematopoietic cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This specific expression pattern of Gfi1 was then used to demonstrate that the number and the size of intra-aortic clusters is reduced in Gata3−/− embryos (Figures 1D and 1E), which was also shown quantitatively (Figure 1F). We looked for changes in expression of other known HSC markers by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of ventral halves of subdissected aorta-mesenchyme tissue. While Bmp4 and C-myb levels were not affected by the absence of Gata3, there was a significant reduction in Runx1 and Gata2 expression (Figure 1G). These results validate that phenotypic HSCs, as detected by the expression of Ly-6A GFP, are reduced in AGMs deficient for Gata3 and that their production may be disrupted, as evidenced by the diminished number of hemogenic endothelial cells and intra-aortic clusters. To understand the mechanism by which Gata3 regulates HSC production in the AGM, its expression in specific cell types was determined using a Gata3-LacZ knockin mouse line (van Doorninck et al., 1999van Doorninck J.H. van Der Wees J. Karis A. Goedknegt E. Engel J.D. Coesmans M. Rutteman M. Grosveld F. De Zeeuw C.I. GATA-3 is involved in the development of serotonergic neurons in the caudal raphe nuclei.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC12PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry analysis of FDG-loaded cells from E11.5 Gata3+/lz AGMs revealed Gata3 expression in some ckit+ and some CD31+ cells (Figure 2A). However, when compared with the background control (no antibody), there does not seem to be any overlap between Gata3-expressing cells and CD41+ or CD45+ cells, suggesting that Gata3 is not expressed in hematopoietic cells in the AGM. Furthermore, isolating cell populations enriched for HSCs, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal cells from E11.5 wild-type subdissected aorta-mesenchymes by flow sorting using a combination of well-established markers (North et al., 2002North T.E. de Bruijn M.F. Stacy T. Talebian L. Lind E. Robin C. Binder M. Dzierzak E. Speck N.A.

Characterization of the first definitive hematopoietic stem cells in the AGM and liver of the mouse embryo.Immunity. 1996; 5: 513-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and analyzing these by quantitative RT-PCR showed that there is little to no Gata3 expression in phenotypic HSCs (Figure 2B). To further investigate if Gata3 is expressed in HSCs, Gata3-LacZ+ and LacZ− cells were tested for repopulation activity in transplantation assays. In the first set of experiments, LacZ+ and LacZ− cells were sorted from freshly dissected E11.5 Gata3+/lz AGMs (the urogenital ridges were removed prior to sorting to eliminate LacZ+ mesonephric duct cells) and directly injected into recipients. However, none of the 14 mice injected with LacZ+ cells showed any signs of repopulation, while only 1 out of 13 recipients was robustly repopulated with Gata3-LacZ− cells (Table 2). This low level of HSC activity in both cell populations is most likely due to the heterozygous background of the Gata3+/lz AGMs because we observed reduced repopulation activity in direct transplantation assays with total AGM cells from Gata3+/− embryos (Table 1). We therefore cultured E11.5 Gata3+/lz AGMs as whole-organ explants for 3 days in the presence of Interleukin 3, which has previously been demonstrated to expand AGM HSCs (Robin et al., 2006Robin C. Ottersbach K. Durand C. Peeters M. Vanes L. Tybulewicz V. Dzierzak E. An unexpected role for IL-3 in the embryonic development of hematopoietic stem cells.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). At the end of the culture period, LacZ+ and LacZ− cells were sorted and analyzed in transplantation assays. The results in Table 2 clearly show that all of the long-term repopulating activity resides within the Gata3-LacZ− fraction, with all of the recipients that received LacZ− cells displaying high levels of donor chimerism, while none of the recipients of LacZ+ cells showed any signs of repopulation.Table 2HSC Activity in Sorted AGM Cell Populations from E11 Gata3+/lz EmbryosCell PopulationCell Dose (Embryo Equivalent)Number of Mice Repopulated/Total TransplantedChimerism (Percent)Direct transplantationaAGMs were dissected from Gata3+/lz E11 embryos, the urogenital ridges were removed, and the cells were dissociated with collagenase treatment, stained with FDG, sorted into LacZ+ and LacZ− populations, and directly transplanted into irradiated adult recipients.Gata3-LacZ+1–50/130Gata3-LacZ−1–41/14cWe detected the donor marker in a second recipient.

https://openalex.org/W1998460625,"Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) reside in specific niches within seminiferous tubules. These niches are thought to secrete chemotactic factors for SSCs, because SSCs migrate to them upon transplantation. However, the identity of these chemotactic molecules remains unknown. Here, we established a testis feeder cell culture system and used it to identify SSC chemotactic factors. When seeded on testis cells from infertile mice, SSCs migrated beneath the Sertoli cells and formed colonies with a cobblestone appearance that were very similar to those produced by hematopoietic stem cells. Cultured cells maintained SSC activity and fertility for at least 5 months. Cobblestone colony formation depended on GDNF and CXCL12, and dominant-negative GDNF receptor transfection or CXCL12 receptor deficiency reduced SSC colonization. Moreover, GDNF upregulated CXCL12 receptor expression, and CXCL12 transfection in Sertoli cells increased homing efficiency. Overall, our findings identify GDNF and CXCL12 as SSC chemotactic factors in vitro and in vivo. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) reside in specific niches within seminiferous tubules. These niches are thought to secrete chemotactic factors for SSCs, because SSCs migrate to them upon transplantation. However, the identity of these chemotactic molecules remains unknown. Here, we established a testis feeder cell culture system and used it to identify SSC chemotactic factors. When seeded on testis cells from infertile mice, SSCs migrated beneath the Sertoli cells and formed colonies with a cobblestone appearance that were very similar to those produced by hematopoietic stem cells. Cultured cells maintained SSC activity and fertility for at least 5 months. Cobblestone colony formation depended on GDNF and CXCL12, and dominant-negative GDNF receptor transfection or CXCL12 receptor deficiency reduced SSC colonization. Moreover, GDNF upregulated CXCL12 receptor expression, and CXCL12 transfection in Sertoli cells increased homing efficiency. Overall, our findings identify GDNF and CXCL12 as SSC chemotactic factors in vitro and in vivo. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) retain activity in primary testis cell coculture SSCs migrate to the in vitro niche and form cobblestone colonies GDNF and CXCL12 enhance SSC migration and cobblestone colony formation SSC niche colonization in vivo requires CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 Several self-renewal systems are present in the body, which are maintained by stem cell division. Stem cells in these tissues are thought to reside in a special microenvironment called a “niche” (Spradling et al., 2001Spradling A. Drummond-Barbosa D. Kai T. Stem cells find their niche.Nature. 2001; 414: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Stem cells in the niche have a high probability for self-renewal division, whereas committed daughter cells leave the niche to terminally differentiate. Therefore, the niche must provide factors to maintain stem cells and exclude those that trigger differentiation. Although the niche theory was originally proposed to explain the behavior of transplanted hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Schofield, 1978Schofield R. The relationship between the spleen colony-forming cell and the haemopoietic stem cell.Blood Cells. 1978; 4: 7-25PubMed Google Scholar), it has been extended to other self-renewing tissues, including Drosophila germline niches, which have simplistic structures that allow detailed molecular analyses (Spradling et al., 2001Spradling A. Drummond-Barbosa D. Kai T. Stem cells find their niche.Nature. 2001; 414: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). However, self-renewing tissues in mammals are generally more complex, and much remains unknown about the mammalian niche and how it maintains stem cells. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in testes provide the foundation for spermatogenesis throughout life (de Rooij and Russell, 2000de Rooij D.G. Russell L.D. All you wanted to know about spermatogonia but were afraid to ask.J. Androl. 2000; 21: 776-798PubMed Google Scholar; Meistrich and van Beek, 1993Meistrich M.L. van Beek M.E.A.B. Spermatogonial stem cells.in: Desjardins C. Ewing L.L. Cell and Molecular Biology of the Testis. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 266-295Google Scholar). The identification of SSCs depends on their ability to self-renew, not on their morphology. In 1994, a transplantation assay to study SSCs was developed (Brinster and Zimmermann, 1994Brinster R.L. Zimmermann J.W. Spermatogenesis following male germ-cell transplantation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 11298-11302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). When SSCs are microinjected into the seminiferous tubules of infertile testes, SSCs reinitiate and maintain spermatogenesis for a long duration. Transplanted SSCs attach to Sertoli cells, the only somatic cell type that directly interacts with SSCs in seminiferous tubules, and transmigrate through the tight junction between Sertoli cells from the adluminal side toward the basal compartment of the tubules. SSCs then recolonize empty niches, which are located on the basement membrane (Nagano et al., 1999Nagano M. Avarbock M.R. Brinster R.L. Pattern and kinetics of mouse donor spermatogonial stem cell colonization in recipient testes.Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 1429-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The interaction between SSCs and the niche is dynamic, as transplantation of a large number of SSCs results in colonization even in a nonablated wild-type (WT) environment (Shinohara et al., 2002Shinohara T. Orwig K.E. Avarbock M.R. Brinster R.L. Germ line stem cell competition in postnatal mouse testes.Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The spermatogonial transplantation technique has not only provided a functional assay for SSCs but has also demonstrated the homing activity of SSCs. In 2000, GDNF was identified as a self-renewal factor for SSCs (Meng et al., 2000Meng X. Lindahl M. Hyvönen M.E. Parvinen M. de Rooij D.G. Hess M.W. Raatikainen-Ahokas A. Sainio K. Rauvala H. Lakso M. et al.Regulation of cell fate decision of undifferentiated spermatogonia by GDNF.Science. 2000; 287: 1489-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice that overexpress GDNF, clusters of undifferentiated spermatogonia accumulate in the seminiferous tubules, whereas spermatogonial depletion and male infertility occur in Gdnf heterozygous knockout (KO) mice. Moreover, adding GDNF to SSCs is necessary for in vitro proliferation (Kanatsu-Shinohara et al., 2003Kanatsu-Shinohara M. Ogonuki N. Inoue K. Miki H. Ogura A. Toyokuni S. Shinohara T. Long-term proliferation in culture and germline transmission of mouse male germline stem cells.Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). These results established that the level of GDNF is critical for SSC self-renewal and survival. Despite these findings, the identity and location of the niche remains elusive. For example, in one study, SSCs were shown to reside in areas of the seminiferous tubules that closely associate with blood vessels (Yoshida et al., 2007Yoshida S. Sukeno M. Nabeshima Y. A vasculature-associated niche for undifferentiated spermatogonia in the mouse testis.Science. 2007; 317: 1722-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), but another study demonstrated that the number of Sertoli cells, not the location of blood vessels, dictates the niche distribution (Oatley et al., 2011Oatley M.J. Racicot K.E. Oatley J.M. Sertoli cells dictate spermatogonial stem cell niches in the mouse testis.Biol. Reprod. 2011; 84: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The difficulty in studying SSC-niche interactions in vivo is caused in part by the inability to identify SSCs by their morphology. Although the transplantation assay is a reliable method for detecting SSCs, stable colonies are found only after ∼6 weeks posttransplantation, and difficulty in distinguishing SSCs from progenitors in early phases of colonization makes it impossible to localize the niche in situ. In fact, only 5%–10% of Asingle spermatogonia may have SSC potential by transplantation (Nagano et al., 1999Nagano M. Avarbock M.R. Brinster R.L. Pattern and kinetics of mouse donor spermatogonial stem cell colonization in recipient testes.Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 1429-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar; Nagano, 2003Nagano M.C. Homing efficiency and proliferation kinetics of male germ line stem cells following transplantation in mice.Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and in situ SSC identification is difficult due to the lack of an SSC-specific marker. In mammals, the interaction between stem cells and their niche has been studied most extensively in HSCs, for which partial in vitro reconstruction of the stem cell microenvironment is possible (Dexter et al., 1977Dexter T.M. Allen T.D. Lajtha L.G. Conditions controlling the proliferation of haemopoietic stem cells in vitro.J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 91: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). In long-term bone marrow cultures, HSCs closely associate with the pre-established stromal layer that facilitates HSC survival and differentiation. HSCs undergo apoptosis if they are prevented from attaching to stromal cells. Primitive cells, including HSCs, migrate through the stromal layer and produce colonies of primitive cells, called cobblestone areas, which consist of tightly packed nonrefractile phase-dark cells growing underneath the stroma. Under these conditions, HSCs are thought to maintain a steady state of cell production that continues for several months, and some differentiating progenitors are released into the culture medium. The technique has been used to quantify HSCs or primitive progenitors by counting cobblestone colonies (Ploemacher et al., 1989Ploemacher R.E. van der Sluijs J.P. Voerman J.S.A. Brons N.H.C. An in vitro limiting-dilution assay of long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells in the mouse.Blood. 1989; 74: 2755-2763PubMed Google Scholar). Although the in vivo transplantation assay has been the ultimate demonstration of HSC activity, this cobblestone-area-forming cell assay has served as an alternative in vitro method for assessing HSC potential. This method has been particularly useful for evaluating HSC activities in humans, for which direct transplantation experiments are not feasible. In this study, we report a testis cell culture method that can maintain SSCs for a long duration. In this culture system, SSCs produce cobblestone colonies that are morphologically indistinguishable from HSCs growing under bone marrow stroma. The cobblestone formation depends on GDNF and CXCL12, which are secreted from the testis stroma cells. Involvement of these cytokines in SSC homing to the niche in vivo was also demonstrated using spermatogonial transplantation. To establish testis cell culture conditions that mimic the in vivo seminiferous tubule environment, testis cells were prepared from 5- to 6-week-old congenitally infertile WBB6F1-W/Wv (designated W) mice, which are enriched with Sertoli cells due to the loss of differentiating germ cells by Kit tyrosine kinase mutations (Geissler et al., 1988Geissler E.N. Ryan M.A. Housman D.E. The dominant-white spotting (W) locus of the mouse encodes the c-kit proto-oncogene.Cell. 1988; 55: 185-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). A testis cell suspension was then plated on laminin-coated dishes in serum-free medium, supplemented with EGF (E), FGF2 (F), and FGF9. The testis feeder cells were used for coculture after mitomycin C (MMC) treatment. When germline stem (GS) cells from C57BL/6 Tg14(act-EGFP) OsbY01 (Green) mice were plated on the feeder cells with EGF, FGF2, and GDNF (G) and 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS; EFG condition), some of the cells migrated beneath the feeders, whereas others produced clumps on top of the feeders within 7–14 days after coculture. The former colonies, which constituted 12.3% ± 0.6% of total colonies (n = 12) at 7 days after coculture, were composed of flat phase-dark cells with clear nuclei and cell borders, closely resembling hematopoietic cobblestone colonies (Figures 1A and 1B ) (Dexter et al., 1977Dexter T.M. Allen T.D. Lajtha L.G. Conditions controlling the proliferation of haemopoietic stem cells in vitro.J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 91: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). The latter colonies resembled those on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Figure 1A) and consisted of morula-like clumps with an unclear border between cells. The cobblestone colonies were not derived from residual spermatogonia of W mice, because they expressed enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) under UV light (Figure 1C). Itgb1-KO GS cells, which proliferate to form clump colonies on MEFs (Kanatsu-Shinohara et al., 2008Kanatsu-Shinohara M. Takehashi M. Takashima S. Lee J. Morimoto H. Chuma S. Raducanu A. Nakatsuji N. Fässler R. Shinohara T. Homing of mouse spermatogonial stem cells to germline niche depends on β1-integrin.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 533-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), showed reduced cobblestone formation, suggesting the involvement of ITGB1 on cobblestone generation (Figure 1D). The feeder layer predominantly consisted of GATA4+ Sertoli cells, covering more than >80% of the total area (Figure 1E). PDGFRA+ Leydig cells were also found in the culture (∼10%), but they were not necessarily associated closely with the cobblestone colonies. Both Sertoli cells and Leydig cells were mitotically active before MMC treatment, as shown by Ki67 expression in both VIM+ Sertoli cells (51.6%) and PDGFRA+ Leydig cells (42.2%) (Figure S1A available online). Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that the cultured cells expressed SSC markers, including EPCAM, ITGA6, ITGB1, and CD9 (Figure 1F). Although the expression levels of these markers were comparable to those cultured on MEFs, coculturing with testis feeder cells strongly upregulated KIT, a marker for differentiating spermatogonia. We also assessed germ cell differentiation levels using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of spermatogonia markers, such as Stra8, Neurog3, Zbtb16, Pou5f1, Ret, and Taf4b, or meiotic germ cell markers, such as Dmc1, Clgn, Piwil1, and Sycp1, did not change significantly depending on the type of cytokines used to induce cobblestone colonies (Figure 1G and Table S1). Because we did not find expression of postmeiotic markers, such as Prm, these results suggested that the cultures contained premeiotic cells that could not complete meiosis. These cobblestone colonies were induced on freeze-thawed testis feeder cells prepared from W mice as well as on testis cells from WT mice, albeit at significantly lower levels (data not shown). The ability to support cobblestone formation is acquired by somatic cells in the gonad in the early stage of the embryonic period, as shown by the presence of cobblestone colonies on somatic feeder cells prepared from W mouse male gonads 13.5 days postcoitus (dpc) (Figure 1H). However, cobblestone colonies were not found on cell lines, such as PA6 bone marrow stromal cells or the 15P-1 Sertoli cell line (Kodama et al., 1982Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Koyama H. Kasai S. Hormonal responsiveness of a preadipose cell line derived from newborn mouse calvaria.J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 112: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar; Rassoulzadegan et al., 1993Rassoulzadegan M. Paquis-Flucklinger V. Bertino B. Sage J. Jasin M. Miyagawa K. van Heyningen V. Besmer P. Cuzin F. Transmeiotic differentiation of male germ cells in culture.Cell. 1993; 75: 997-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). When primary testis feeder cells were compared with 15P-1 cells by immunohistochemistry, we found that 15P-1 cells lacked expression of CLDN11 (Figure S1B). Although ITGB1 and VIM were similarly expressed in both 15P-1 and primary testis feeder cells, not all the Sertoli cells expressed SOX9 and WT1 in testis feeder cells. This was in contrast to 15P-1 cells, because all of the cells in culture expressed these two molecules. These results suggested that several features of primary Sertoli cells are lost or modified in 15P-1 cells, which may have contributed to the lack of cobblestone colonies in cultures with 15P-1 cells. Because GS cells do not necessarily exhibit the same characteristics as SSCs in the testes (Morimoto et al., 2009Morimoto H. Kanatsu-Shinohara M. Takashima S. Chuma S. Nakatsuji N. Takehashi M. Shinohara T. Phenotypic plasticity of mouse spermatogonial stem cells.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we next examined whether SSCs freshly isolated from testes have cobblestone-forming activity. For this experiment, an SSC-enriched population was collected from 12- to 16-day-old or 8-week-old Green mice using an antibody against ITGA6, which is expressed on SSCs (Shinohara et al., 1999Shinohara T. Avarbock M.R. Brinster R.L. β1- and α6-integrin are surface markers on mouse spermatogonial stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 5504-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The same population of cells was used simultaneously for spermatogonial transplantation in experiments using pups (Figure 2A). After magnetic sorting, 20.9% ± 7.3% and 11.0% ± 2.7% (n = 3) of the input cells were recovered from pup and adult testes, respectively. The selected cells were plated on testis feeder cells under the EFG condition to quantify the cobblestone areas. In both pup and adult experiments, the numbers of cobblestone colonies, as defined by clusters of six or more cells, increased after ITGA6-mediated selection at both time points. For pup experiments, the numbers of cobblestone colonies from ITGA6-expressing cells were 59.8 ± 8.6 and 35.7 ± 6.3/105 cells (n = 112) at 1 and 2 weeks, respectively, and the numbers were significantly higher than those of control whole testes cells, which produced 11.6 ± 3.0 and 3.6 ± 1.8 colonies/105 cells (n = 112) for 1 and 2 weeks, respectively (Figure 2B). Similarly, ITGA6-selected adult testis cells generated 72.9 ± 11.7 and 91.7 ± 13.3 cobblestone colonies/105 cells (n = 96) at 1 and 2 weeks, respectively (Figure 2C). Consistent with the low SSC frequency in the adult testis (Shinohara et al., 2001Shinohara T. Orwig K.E. Avarbock M.R. Brinster R.L. Remodeling of the postnatal mouse testis is accompanied by dramatic changes in stem cell number and niche accessibility.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 6186-6191Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), cobblestone colonies were rarely produced by the control whole adult testis cells, and the numbers of colonies were 2.1 ± 1.5 and 3.1 ± 1.8/105 cells (n = 96) for 1 and 2 weeks, respectively. When the SSC activities of pup testis cells were determined by spermatogonial transplantation, ITGA6-selected cells produced 28.9 ± 7.4 colonies/105 cells (n = 16), whereas nonselected control cells produced 6.4 ± 2.3 colonies/105 cells (n = 16), showing a 4.5-fold increase (Figures 2D and 2E). Taken together, these results show that cobblestone-forming activities are not limited to GS cells but also found in freshly prepared pup and adult testis cells. To understand the mechanism of cobblestone formation, we compared the impact of cytokines on cobblestone forming activity of GS cells. Besides GDNF, EGF, and FGF2, we investigated the effect of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which induces GDNF expression in Sertoli cells in vivo (Tadokoro et al., 2002Tadokoro Y. Yomogida K. Ohta H. Tohda A. Nishimune Y. Homeostatic regulation of germinal stem cell proliferation by the GDNF/FSH pathway.Mech. Dev. 2002; 113: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Cobblestone formation was induced by the combination of EGF and FGF2 (EF condition), but the frequency was significantly lower than that induced only by GDNF (G condition). However, the low frequency under the EF condition was significantly improved by adding FSH (EF + FSH condition) (Figure 3A), although FSH itself did not induce cobblestones. We also compared the effects of KITL and CXCL12, both of which increase HSC cobblestone formation (Szilvassy et al., 1996Szilvassy S.J. Weller K.P. Lin W. Sharma A.K. Ho A.S.Y. Tsukamoto A. Hoffman R. Leiby K.R. Gearing D.P. Leukemia inhibitory factor upregulates cytokine expression by a murine stromal cell line enabling the maintenance of highly enriched competitive repopulating stem cells.Blood. 1996; 87: 4618-4628PubMed Google Scholar; Tzeng et al., 2011Tzeng Y.-S. Li H. Kang Y.-L. Chen W.-C. Cheng W.-C. Lai D.-M. Loss of Cxcl12/Sdf-1 in adult mice decreases the quiescent state of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and alters the pattern of hematopoietic regeneration after myelosuppression.Blood. 2011; 117: 429-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Adding CXCL12 increased the cobblestone frequency when the cells were cultured under the EF + FSH condition, whereas KITL downregulated the cobblestone frequency to ∼0.7-fold (Figure 3B). Cobblestone formation under the EF + FSH condition was inhibited by GDNF neutralizing antibody, whereas KITL neutralizing antibody did not show any effect (Figure 3C), suggesting the contribution of GDNF to cobblestone formation under the EF + FSH condition. In contrast, cobblestone formation under the EF + FSH condition was not suppressed by AMD3100, which inhibits the binding of CXCL12 to its receptor CXCR4 (Figure 3D) (Donzella et al., 1998Donzella G.A. Schols D. Lin S.W. Esté J.A. Nagashima K.A. Maddon P.J. Allaway G.P. Sakmar T.P. Henson G. De Clercq E. Moore J.P. AMD3100, a small molecule inhibitor of HIV-1 entry via the CXCR4 co-receptor.Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Notably, AMD3100 inhibited the cobblestone that developed under the EFG condition, suggesting that cobblestone formation under EFG condition depends partly on CXCL12 produced in the cultures. The results of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that CXCL12 was expressed at a significantly higher level than GDNF in the culture supernatants and that both GDNF and CXCL12 expression increased under the EF condition (Figure 3E). However, neither GDNF nor CXCL12 could upregulate each other’s expression. Furthermore, FSH also did not influence the expression of these cytokines, suggesting the involvement of other molecules. To determine whether the cultured cells maintain SSC activity, we collected a portion of cells during culture and measured SSC activity by transplantation into W mice during a 5-month culture (Table S2). We compared three types of cultures maintained with different sets of cytokines. Although costimulation by GDNF and FGF2 is a prerequisite for SSC proliferation cultured on laminin-coated plates (Lee et al., 2007Lee J. Kanatsu-Shinohara M. Inoue K. Ogonuki N. Miki H. Toyokuni S. Kimura T. Nakano T. Ogura A. Shinohara T. Akt mediates self-renewal division of mouse spermatogonial stem cells.Development. 2007; 134: 1853-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), the total germ cell number increased exponentially when the cells were cultured only with GDNF (Figure 4A), which could have been due to FGF2 expression from testis feeder cells (Figure S2A). In contrast, the number of germ cells was relatively constant under the EF and EF + FSH conditions, in which KIT expression was upregulated (Figure 1F). KIT upregulation was only slightly suppressed by GDNF, suggesting that the feeder cells secrete differentiation-inducing molecules. Germ cell colonies were consistently found in recipients after spermatogonial transplantation with all types of cultures (Figure 4B and Table S2). The concentrations of SSCs, as estimated by the number of germ cell colonies, were comparable among the three types of culture. However, the fact that cell number increased under the G condition indicates that SSCs preferentially increase their number even on testis cells as long as exogenous GDNF is present in the medium (Table S2). Although KIT upregulation suggested increased differentiation under the EF and EF + FSH conditions, SSCs were not only maintained successfully, but they also reinitiated normal spermatogenesis, which was shown by histological and RT-PCR analyses (Figures 4C and 4D and Table S1). To examine whether cobblestone colonies possess SSC activity, we separated the two types of colonies by EDTA treatment and gentle pipetting. Cells enriched for each colony type were transplanted into testes. The numbers of colonies generated from cobblestone and clump colonies were comparable regardless of culture conditions, and we did not find statistical differences (Table S3). Cobblestone colonies could be reproduced after replating of cobblestone cells, whose SSC potential could be demonstrated at least up to 10 weeks (Table S4). Furthermore, when we picked single colonies by micromanipulation and replated the dissociated cells, cobblestone colonies showed a higher frequency of cobblestone formation compared to clump colonies (Figure 4E). These results suggested that not only clump colonies, but also cobblestone colonies, have SSC activity. To confirm whether the cultured cells were fertile, we killed one of the W mice that received a transplant of cells cultured for 3 months under the EF condition. After cryopreservation of the testes for 7 days, germ cells from EGFP-expressing seminiferous tubules were used for microinsemination (Figure 4F). In total, 95 embryos were created, and 70 two-cell embryos were transferred into uteri of pseudopregnant mothers. Fifteen offspring were produced, seven males and eight females (Figures 4G and 4H). A combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) of their tail DNA showed that the offspring had normal DNA methylation patterns in imprinted genes (Figure S2B). These results showed that SSCs in cobblestone cultures are functionally normal. On the basis of our in vitro observations, we hypothesized that CXCL12 and GDNF mediate SSC homing in vivo. In the first set of experiments, we examined the involvement of CXCR4 in SSC homing. While CXCL12 was expressed in Sertoli cells (Figure S3A), Asingle or Apaired ZBTB16+ spermatogonia showed CXCR4 expression (Figures S3B and S3C). CXCR4 was found more frequently in Asingle or Apaired than in Aaligned cells (Table S5). Notably, the expression of CXCR4 in GS cells increased to a greater extent under the G condition than under the EF condition (Figure 5A) (Castellone et al., 2004Castellone M.D. Guarino V. De Falco V. Carlomagno F. Basolo F. Faviana P. Kruhoffer M. Orntoft T. Russell J.P. Rothstein J.L. et al.Functional expression of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor is induced by RET/PTC oncogenes and is a common event in human papillary thyroid carcinomas.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5958-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar; Lu et al., 2009Lu B.C. Cebrian C. Chi X. Kuure S. Kuo R. Bates C.M. Arber S. Hassell J. MacNeil L. Hoshi M. et al.Etv4 and Etv5 are required downstream of GDNF and Ret for kidney branching morphogenesis.Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, adding CXCL12 or AMD3100 did not have a significant effect on GS cell proliferation (Figures 5B and 5C), which suggests that CXCL12 does not influence SSC proliferation. To examine the involvement of CXCR4 in SSC homing, we used Cxcr4 conditional KO mice, in which the Cxcr4 gene is flanked by loxP sites (Cxcr4 floxed mice) (Figures 5D and 5E). This mouse was crossed with the ROSA26 reporter mouse strain (R26R) to visualize the pattern of colonization after transplantation (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4153) Google Scholar; Tokoyoda et al., 2004Tokoyoda K. Egawa T. Sugiyama T. Choi B.I. Nagasawa T. Cellular niches controlling B lymphocyte behavior within bone marrow during development.Immunity. 2004; 20: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Testis cells were collected from 10- to 19-day-old homozygous Cxcr4 floxed mice heterozygous for the R26R allele, and then single-cell suspensions were exposed to adenovirus expressing Cre (AxCANCre) overnight in vitro. Cre-treated heterozygous R26R mice were used as controls. After incubation, 63.8% ± 3.3% and 77.4% ± 11.4% (n = 6) of the infected cells were recovered from control and mutant testis cells, respectively. Southern blot analyses showed that 69.6% ± 5.4% (n = 6) of the floxed allele was deleted from the Cxcr4 gene locus at the time of transplantation (Figure 5F). Analyses of the recipient testes showed a significant reduction in germ cell colonies by Cxcr4-KO testis cells (Figures 5G and 5H). We also examined the effect of Cxcr4 deficiency on GS cell proliferation and homing by establishing GS cells from Cxcr4 floxed mice (Cxcr4-KO GS cells) (Figure S3D). Consistent with the results using AMD3100, Cxcr4 deficiency did not significantly influence proliferation, as demonstrated by normal proliferation of Cxcr4-KO GS cells in vitro after the Cre treatment (Figure 5I). In addition, no increase occurred in the frequency of Annexin V+ cells in Cxcr4-KO GS cells in vitro after cytokine removal or in vivo after transplantation (Figures S3E and S3F). Although the frequency of clump colonies did not change by Cxcr4 deficiency (Figure S3G), these Cxcr4-KO GS cells showed impaired in vitro cobblestone formation and in vivo colony formation (Figures 5J and 5K). Taken together, these results indicate that Cxcr4 deficiency inhibits SSC homing, but not their proliferation or survival. We next examined the involvement of GDNF in SSC homing. However, because GDNF is involved i"
https://openalex.org/W2011197454,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the leading neurodegenerative disorders of older adults, which causes major socioeconomic burdens globally, lacks effective therapeutics without significant side effects. Besides the hallmark pathology of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), it has been reported that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a critical neuronal kinase, is hyperactivated in AD brains and is, in part, responsible for the above pathology. Here we show that a modified truncated 24-aa peptide (TFP5), derived from the Cdk5 activator p35, penetrates the blood-brain barrier after intraperitoneal injections, inhibits abnormal Cdk5 hyperactivity, and significantly rescues AD pathology (up to 70–80%) in 5XFAD AD model mice. The mutant mice, injected with TFP5 exhibit behavioral rescue, whereas no rescue was observed in mutant mice injected with either saline or scrambled peptide. However, TFP5 does not inhibit cell cycle Cdks or normal Cdk5/p35 activity, and thereby has no toxic side effects (even at 200 mg/kg), a common problem in most current therapeutics for AD. In addition, treated mice displayed decreased inflammation, amyloid plaques, NFTs, cell death, and an extended life by 2 mo. These results suggest TFP5 as a potential therapeutic, toxicity-free candidate for AD.—Shukla, V., Zheng, Y.-L., Mishra, S. K., Amin, N. D., Steiner, J., Grant, P., Kesavapany, S., Pant, H. C.

https://openalex.org/W2118899477,"Peter Gregersen and colleagues identify a regulatory variant in CSK, coding for an intracellular kinase that physically interacts with Lyp (PTPN22), associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Their work suggests that the Lyp-Csk complex influences susceptibility to SLE through regulation of B-cell signaling, maturation and activation. The c-Src tyrosine kinase, Csk, physically interacts with the intracellular phosphatase Lyp (encoded by PTPN22) and can modify the activation state of downstream Src kinases, such as Lyn, in lymphocytes. We identified an association of CSK with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and refined its location to the intronic polymorphism rs34933034 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.32; P = 1.04 × 10−9). The risk allele at this SNP is associated with increased CSK expression and augments inhibitory phosphorylation of Lyn. In carriers of the risk allele, there is increased B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated activation of mature B cells, as well as higher concentrations of plasma immunoglobulin M (IgM), relative to individuals with the non-risk haplotype. Moreover, the fraction of transitional B cells is doubled in the cord blood of carriers of the risk allele, due to an expansion of late transitional cells in a stage targeted by selection mechanisms. This suggests that the Lyp-Csk complex increases susceptibility to lupus at multiple maturation and activation points in B cells."

https://openalex.org/W2067092931,"Abnormal expression of regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome (DS). There are two major isoforms of RCAN1, isoforms 1 and 4. RCAN1 isoform 1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons. In this report, we showed that there are two translation start codons in RCAN1 exon 1 serving as a functional translation initiation site to generate a longer 41-kDa isoform 1 (RCAN1.1L) and a shorter 31-kDa isoform 1 (RCAN1.1S). The first translation initiation site has higher translation efficiency than the downstream second one, and the translation initiation of two AUG sites is by a Cap-dependent mechanism. Short-term expression of RCAN1.1L protected SH-SY5Y cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-3 activation. However, long-term accumulation of RCAN1.1L in SH-SY5Y cells promoted oxidative stress-induced apoptosis via caspase-3 activation, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay showed that the apoptosis ratio was increased to 499.03 ± 47.56% in SH-1.1L cells compared with 283.93 ± 28.66% in control cells. Furthermore, we found that RCAN1.1L is significantly elevated in the AD brains and patients with DS. RCAN1.1S is expressed at a low level in both human cells and brain tissues. Our results defined the regulatory mechanism underlying RCAN1 expression and the roles of RCAN1.1 in oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration in AD and DS pathogenesis.—Wu, Y., Song, W.

https://openalex.org/W2021934773,"The biosynthesis of many vitamins and coenzymes has often proven difficult to elucidate owing to a combination of low abundance and kinetic lability of the pathway intermediates. Through a serial reconstruction of the cobalamin (vitamin B(12)) pathway in Escherichia coli and by His tagging the terminal enzyme in the reaction sequence, we have observed that many unstable intermediates can be isolated as tightly bound enzyme-product complexes. Together, these approaches have been used to extract intermediates between precorrin-4 and hydrogenobyrinic acid in their free acid form and permitted the delineation of the overall reaction catalyzed by CobL, including the formal elucidation of precorrin-7 as a metabolite. Furthermore, a substrate-carrier protein, CobE, that can also be used to stabilize some of the transient metabolic intermediates and enhance their onward transformation, has been identified. The tight association of pathway intermediates with enzymes provides evidence for a form of metabolite channeling."

https://openalex.org/W2133281386,"Some planetary systems harbour debris disks containing planetesimals such as asteroids and comets. Collisions between such bodies produce small dust particles, the spectral features of which reveal their composition and, hence, that of their parent bodies. A measurement of the composition of olivine crystals has been done for the protoplanetary disk HD100546 and for olivine crystals in the warm inner parts of planetary systems. The latter compares well with the iron-rich olivine in asteroids (x<0.29). In the cold outskirts of the Beta Pictoris system, an analogue to the young Solar System, olivine crystals were detected but their composition remained undetermined, leaving unknown how the composition of the bulk of Solar System cometary olivine grains compares with that of extrasolar comets. Here we report the detection of the 69-micrometre-wavelength band of olivine crystals in the spectrum of Beta Pictoris. Because the disk is optically thin, we can associate the crystals with an extrasolar proto-Kuiper belt a distance of 15-45 astronomical units from the star (one astronomical unit is the Sun-Earth distance), determine their magnesium-rich composition (x=0.01+/-0.001) and show that they make up 3.6+/-1.0 per cent of the total dust mass. These values are strikingly similar to those for the dust emitted by the most primitive comets in the Solar System, even though Beta Pictoris is more massive and more luminous and has a different planetary system architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2000700531,"Specialized contractile function and increased mitochondrial number and oxidative capacity are hallmark features of myocyte differentiation. The estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) can regulate mitochondrial biogenesis or mitochondrial enzyme expression in skeletal muscle, suggesting that ERRs may have a role in promoting myogenesis. Therefore, we characterized myogenic programs in primary myocytes isolated from wild-type (M-ERRγWT) and muscle-specific ERRγ–/– (M-ERRγ–/–) mice. Myotube maturation and number were decreased throughout differentiation in M-ERRγ–/– primary myocytes, resulting in myotubes with reduced mitochondrial content and sarcomere assembly. Compared with M-ERRγWT myocytes at the same differentiation stage, the glucose oxidation rate was reduced by 30% in M-ERRγ–/– myotubes, while medium-chain fatty acid oxidation was increased by 34% in M-ERRγ–/– myoblasts and 36% in M-ERRγ–/– myotubes. Concomitant with increased reliance on mitochondrial β-oxidation, H2O2 production was significantly increased by 40% in M-ERRγ–/– myoblasts and 70% in M-ERRγ–/– myotubes compared to M-ERRγWT myocytes. ROS activation of FoxO and NF-κB and their downstream targets, atrogin-1 and MuRF1, was observed in M-ERRγ–/– myocytes. The antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine rescued myotube formation and atrophy gene induction in M-ERRγ–/– myocytes. These results suggest that loss of ERRγ causes metabolic defects and oxidative stress that impair myotube formation through activation of skeletal muscle atrophy pathways.—Murray, J., Auwerx, J., Huss, J.

https://openalex.org/W2092965322,"Inactivation of the tumor suppressor Ras-association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) due to epigenetic silencing occurs in a variety of human cancers, and still largely unknown are the regulators and mechanisms underlying RASSF1A gene promoter methylation. Herein, we report that this methylation is regulated by p53 and death-associated protein 6 (DAXX) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We found that p53 bound to the RASSF1A promoter, recruiting DAXX as well as DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) for DNA methylation, which subsequently resulted in inactivation of RASSF1A in wild-type p53 ALL cells. Although the presence of p53 was required for the recruitment of DAXX and DNMT1 to the RASSF1A promoter, fluctuation in p53 protein levels did not affect the rates of RASSF1A methylation. Conversely, methylation of RASSF1A promoter was critically controlled by DAXX, as the enforced overexpression of DAXX led to enhanced RASSF1A promoter methylation, whereas inhibition of DAXX reduced RASSF1A methylation. Interestingly, we found that the p53/DAXX-mediated RASSF1A methylation regulated murine double minute 2 (MDM2) protein stability in ALL. Our results reveal a novel function for p53 in the methylation of RASSF1A promoter by its interaction with DAXX. Discovery of this mechanism provides new insight into the interactions among the tumor-related factors p53, RASSF1A, DAXX, and MDM2 in cancer pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1983502562,"Obesity-related metabolic disorders are characterized by mild chronic inflammation, leukocyte infiltration, and tissue fibrosis as a result of adipocytokine production from the expanding white adipose tissue. Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is an endogenous glucocorticoid regulated protein, which modulates systemic anti-inflammatory processes and, therefore, may be altered with increasing adiposity in humans. Paradoxically, we found that plasma AnxA1 concentrations inversely correlated with BMI, total percentage body fat, and waist-to-hip ratio in human subjects. Plasma AnxA1 was also inversely correlated with plasma concentrations of the acute-phase protein, C-reactive protein (CRP), and the adipocytokine leptin, suggesting that as systemic inflammation increases, anti-inflammatory AnxA1 is reduced. In addition, AnxA1 gene expression and protein were significantly up-regulated during adipogenesis in a human adipocyte cell line compared to vehicle alone, demonstrating for the first time that AnxA1 is expressed and excreted from human adipocytes. These data demonstrate a failure in the endogenous anti-inflammatory system to respond to increasing systemic inflammation resulting from expanding adipose tissue, a condition strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These data raise the possibility that a reduction in plasma AnxA1 may contribute to the chronic inflammatory phenotype observed in human obesity.—Kosicka, A., Cunliffe, A.

https://openalex.org/W2024919703,"Defective IL-10 allele is a risk factor for intestinal inflammation. Indeed, IL-10–/– mice are predisposed to spontaneous colitis in the presence of intestinal microbiota, indicating that microbial factors contribute to developing intestinal inflammation. By recognizing flagellin, TLR5 plays a quintessential role in microbial recognition in intestinal epithelial cells. Here, we treated flagellin (1.0 μg/mouse/d) in mouse colon and found that it elicited colonic inflammation in IL-10–/– mice, characterized with tissue hypertrophy, inflamed epithelium, and enhanced cytokine production in the colon (MPO, KC, IL-6; ≥2-fold; P < 0.05). These inflammatory effects were dramatically inhibited in TLR5–/–;IL-10–/– mice. Intestinal epithelium specific PTEN deletion significantly attenuated flagellin-promoted colonic inflammation in IL-10–/– mice. As a molecular mechanism that PTEN deletion inhibited TLR5-elicited responses, we hypothesized that PTEN regulated TLR5-induced responses by controlling the involvement of Mal in TLR5 engagement. Mal interacted with TLR5 on flagellin, and Mal deficiency inhibited flagellin-induced responses in intestinal epithelial cells. Similarly, Mal–/–;IL-10–/– mice showed reduced flagellin-promoted responses. Furthermore, PTEN deletion disrupted Mal-TLR5 interaction, resulting in diminished TLR5-induced responses. PTEN deletion impeded Mal localization at the plasma membrane and suppressed Mal-TLR5 interaction. These results suggest that, by controlling Mal recruitment, PTEN regulates TLR5-induced inflammatory responses.—Choi, Y. J., Jung, J., Chung, H. K., Im, E., Rhee, S. H.

https://openalex.org/W1987955677,"Profiles of sulphate fluxes over the past 300,000 years from an Antarctic ice core show that, whereas the flux of sulphate-adhered dust has remained almost constant, that of sulphate salts correlates inversely with temperature, suggesting a coupling between particulate sulphur and temperature. Polar ice cores preserve a record of sulphate aerosols, but so far, analyses of melted Antarctic ice-core samples have yielded ambiguous conclusions on possible interactions between aerosols and climate. Now, by separating sulphate-adhered dust from sulphate salts, Yoshinori Iizuka et al. show that for the past 300,000 years at the Dome Fuji site in inland Antarctica, the concentration of sulphate salts has been inversely correlated with local climate variations. Changes in sulphate salts since the last glacial maximum may have contributed to modern warming, but the estimated effect is highly uncertain. By contrast, sulphate-ion concentrations have remained constant across glacial to interglacial transitions, which runs counter to the expectations from the long-debated CLAW (Charlson, Lovelock, Andreae and Warren) hypothesis that climate is regulated by sulphate through the medium of marine phytoplankton. Sulphate aerosols, particularly micrometre-sized particles of sulphate salt and sulphate-adhered dust, can act as cloud condensation nuclei, leading to increased solar scattering that cools Earth’s climate1,2. Evidence for such a coupling may lie in the sulphate record from polar ice cores, but previous analyses of melted ice-core samples have provided only sulphate ion concentrations, which may be due to sulphuric acid3. Here we present profiles of sulphate salt and sulphate-adhered dust fluxes over the past 300,000 years from the Dome Fuji ice core in inland Antarctica. Our results show a nearly constant flux of sulphate-adhered dust through glacial and interglacial periods despite the large increases in total dust flux during glacial maxima4. The sulphate salt flux, however, correlates inversely with temperature, suggesting a climatic coupling between particulate sulphur and temperature. For example, the total sulphate salt flux during the Last Glacial Maximum averages 5.78 mg m−2 yr−1, which is almost twice the Holocene value. Although it is based on a modern analogue with considerable uncertainties when applied to the ice-core record, this analysis indicates that the glacial-to-interglacial decrease in sulphate would lessen the aerosol indirect effects on cloud lifetime and albedo, leading to an Antarctic warming of 0.1 to 5 kelvin."
https://openalex.org/W2066452579,"Influenza viruses can cause a broad spectrum of disease severity, including devastating cases in some people. Several factors influence the epidemiological success of the virus; the mechanisms of transmission and the strategies for prevention and treatment have an impact on the disease outcome and the incidence of flu infection in the population. Understanding how and why the viruses spread so efficiently among people and determining possible ways to harness this transmission have been arduous tasks, given the limitations of flu animal models. In 'Bedside to Bench', Kanta Subbarao and Seema S. Lakdawala peruse a study that used a human challenge model to assess influenza transmission; this experimental approach shows how transmission can be studied in humans and emphasizes factors that are different compared to animals, such as distinct disease severity and incidence. Lessons can be taken to optimize animal studies. Another issue that dictates the severity of flu episodes is the potential emergence of drug-resistant strains in treated individuals. In 'Bench to Bedside', Anne Kelso and Aeron C. Hurt discuss another concern—the presence of drug-resistant viruses with additional permissive mutations that make them fit to infect and compete with wild-type strains. The fact that these strains can be found in untreated people and can spread poses a public health concern and a challenge for scientists to find new drugs and assess antiviral combinations."

It was anticipated that these remarkable pieces of research heralded a bright future for malaria control. Has this happened? The genome projects have made some contribution to the development of new malaria tools, such as new vaccine candidates, but a decade is probably too short a period for the research to be translated into success in the field. Knowledge gained from the genome projects may contribute more substantially in the coming decade as efforts to control infection increasingly focus on development of new drugs, insecticides, and vaccines."
