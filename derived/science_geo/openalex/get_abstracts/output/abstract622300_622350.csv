However, for the induced field to persist once the applied field is gone, the electrons must be configured to manifest orbital angular momentum. Generally, the influence of ligands severely restricts that property in transition metal complexes. Bunting et al. now show that a cobalt ion is just barely affected by two linearly coordinated carbon ligands and, as such, exhibits maximal orbital angular momentum. Although its magnetic properties mainly pertain at very low temperature, its structure offers a more general design principle. Science , this issue p. eaat7319"
https://openalex.org/W3105153110,"Magnetic reconnection is an energy conversion process important in many astrophysical contexts including the Earth's magnetosphere, where the process can be investigated in-situ. Here we present the first encounter of a reconnection site by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft in the magnetotail, where reconnection involves symmetric inflow conditions. The unprecedented electron-scale plasma measurements revealed (1) super-Alfvenic electron jets reaching 20,000 km/s, (2) electron meandering motion and acceleration by the electric field, producing multiple crescent-shaped structures, (3) spatial dimensions of the electron diffusion region implying a reconnection rate of 0.1-0.2. The well-structured multiple layers of electron populations indicate that, despite the presence of turbulence near the reconnection site, the key electron dynamics appears to be largely laminar."

The transport of serine into mitochondria supplies most of the 1C units needed for biosynthesis. Kory et al. used a genetic screen to identify the long-sought-after mitochondrial serine transporter. Elucidating the key step of serine transport is important for our understanding of metabolism and has potential implications for cancer treatment. Science , this issue p. eaat9528"

LZTR1 appears to function as an adaptor that promotes ubiquitination of RAS, thus inhibiting its signaling functions.

https://openalex.org/W2901776008,"Purpose To evaluate the topographic distribution of the choriocapillaris (CC) flow deficits in a population of healthy subjects. Methods Using a swept-source optical-coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA) device, two repeated volume 6 x 6 mm and 3 x 3 mm scans were acquired in healthy subjects at the Doheny—UCLA Eye Centers. The en-face CC angiogram was binarized and analyzed for percentage of flow deficits (FD%) using a grid of progressive, concentric rings covering a circular area with a diameter of 2.5 mm (in the 3 x 3 mm scans) and 5 mm (in the 6 x 6 mm scans). The FD% for each ring was plotted against the distance from the fovea. The linear trendline of the resulting curve was analyzed and the slope (m) and intercept (q) were computed. Results Seventy-five eyes of 75 subjects were enrolled and divided into three subgroups based on age (year ranges: 21–40, 41–60 and 61–80). For the entire cohort and within each subgroup, there was a significant association between distance from the fovea and FD% in both 3X3 mm and 6X6 mm scans, with flow deficits increasing with closer proximity to the foveal center. Age was a significant predictor for both m and q for both scan patterns, with older subjects showing a steeper slope. Conclusions In SS-OCTA images, the topographic distribution of CC flow deficits varies with distance from the fovea and age. In particular, the FD% tends to decrease from the fovea towards the periphery, with a steeper decline with advancing age. These normal trends may need to be accounted for in future studies of the CC in disease."
https://openalex.org/W2901655941,"Flavonols are a flavonoid subfamily widely distributed in plants, including several ones of great importance in human and animal diet (apple, tomato, broccoli, onion, beans, tea). These polyphenolic nutraceuticals exert potent antimicrobial (membrane potential disruptors), antioxidant (free-radical scavengers), pharmacokinetic (CYP450 modulators), anti-inflammatory (lipoxygenase inhibitors), antiangiogenic (VEGF inhibitors) and antitumor (cyclin inhibitors) activities. Biotechnological production of these nutraceuticals, for example via heterologous biosynthesis in industrial actinomycetes, is favored since in plants these polyphenols appear as inactive glycosylated derivatives, in low concentrations or as part of complex mixtures with other polyphenolic compounds. In this work, we describe the de novo biosynthesis of three important flavonols, myricetin, kaempferol and quercetin, in the industrially relevant actinomycetes Streptomyces coelicolor and S. albus. De novo biosynthesis of kaempferol, myricetin and quercetin in actinomycetes has not been described before."
https://openalex.org/W2901421994,"Galaxy mergers and gas accretion from the cosmic web drove the growth of galaxies and their central black holes at early epochs. We report spectroscopic imaging of a multiple merger event in the most luminous known galaxy, WISE J224607.56−052634.9 (W2246−0526), a dust-obscured quasar at redshift 4.6, 1.3 billion years after the Big Bang. Far-infrared dust continuum observations show three galaxy companions around W2246−0526 with disturbed morphologies, connected by streams of dust likely produced by the dynamical interaction. The detection of tidal dusty bridges shows that W2246−0526 is accreting its neighbors, suggesting that merger activity may be a dominant mechanism through which the most luminous galaxies simultaneously obscure and feed their central supermassive black holes."
https://openalex.org/W2901744469,"SOX2 is a dose-dependent master stem cell protein that controls the self-renewal and pluripotency or multipotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells and many adult stem cells. We have previously found that SOX2 protein is monomethylated at lysine residues 42 and 117 by SET7 methyltransferase to promote SOX2 proteolysis, whereas LSD1 and PHF20L1 act on both methylated Lys-42 and Lys-117 to prevent SOX2 proteolysis. However, the mechanism by which the methylated SOX2 protein is degraded remains unclear. Here, we report that L3MBTL3, a protein with the malignant-brain-tumor (MBT) methylation-binding domain, is required for SOX2 proteolysis. Our studies showed that L3MBTL3 preferentially binds to the methylated Lys-42 in SOX2, although mutation of Lys-117 also partially reduces the interaction between SOX2 and L3MBTL3. The direct binding of L3MBTL3 to the methylated SOX2 protein leads to the recruitment of the CRL4DCAF5 ubiquitin E3 ligase to target SOX2 protein for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Whereas loss of either LSD1 or PHF20L1 destabilizes SOX2 protein and impairs the self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse ES cells, knockdown of L3MBTL3 or DCAF5 is sufficient to restore the protein levels of SOX2 and rescue the defects of mouse ES cells caused by LSD1 or PHF20L1 deficiency. We also found that retinoic acid-induced differentiation of mouse ES cells is accompanied by the enhanced degradation of the methylated SOX2 protein at both Lys-42 and Lys-117. Our studies provide novel insights into the mechanism by which the methylation-dependent degradation of SOX2 protein is controlled by the L3MBTL3-CRL4DCAF5 ubiquitin ligase complex."
https://openalex.org/W2901475625,"Cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (CRKs) are transmembrane proteins that exhibit ectodomains containing the domain of unknown function 26 (DUF26). The CRKs form a large subfamily of receptor-like kinases in plants, and their possible functions remain to be elucidated. Several lines of evidence suggest that CRKs play important roles in plant defense responses to environmental stress, including plant immunity. We performed a genome-wide analysis of CRK encoding genes in soybean (Glycine max). We found 91 GmCRKs distributed in 16 chromosomes, and identified several tandem and segmental duplications, which influenced the expansion of this gene family. According to our phylogenetic analysis, GmCRKs are grouped in four clades. Furthermore, 12% of the members exhibited GmCRKs with a duplicated bi-modular organization of the ectodomains, containing four DUF26 domains. Expression analysis of GmCRKs was performed by exploring publicly available databases, and by RT-qPCR analysis of selected genes in soybean leaves responding to biotic stress signals. GmCRKs exhibited diverse expression patterns in leaves, stems, roots, and other tissues. Some of them were highly expressed in only one type of tissue, suggesting predominant roles in specific tissues. Furthermore, several GmCRKs were induced with PAMPs, DAMPs and the pathogens Phakopsora pachyrhizi and Phytophthora sojae. Expression profiles of several GmCRKs encoding highly similar proteins exhibited antagonist modes of regulation. The results suggest a fine-tuning control of GmCRKs transcriptional regulation in response to external stimuli, including PAMPs and DAMPs. This study offers a comprehensive view of the GmCRKs family in soybean, and provides a foundation for evolutionary and functional analysis of this family of plant proteins involved in the perception of pathogens and activation of plant immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2901281491,"In vivo micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) can monitor longitudinal changes in bone mass and microstructure in small rodents but imposing high doses of radiation can damage the bone tissue. However, the effect of weekly micro-CT scanning during the adolescence on bone growth and architecture is still unknown. The right proximal tibia of male Sprague-Dawley rats randomized into three dose groups of 0.83, 1.65 and 2.47 Gy (n = 11/group) were CT scanned at weekly intervals from 4th to 12th week of age. The left tibia was used as a control and scanned only at the last time point. Bone marrow cells were investigated, bone growth rates and histomorphometric analyses were performed, and bone structural parameters were determined for both left and right tibiae. Radiation doses of 1.65 and 2.47 Gy affected bone marrow cells, heights of the proliferative and hypertrophic zones, and bone growth rates in the irradiated tibiae. For the 1.65 Gy group, irradiated tibiae resulted in lower BMD, Tb.Th, Tb.N and a higher Tb.Sp compared with the control tibiae. A decrease in BMD, BV/TV, Tb.Th, Tb.N and an increase in Tb.Sp were observed between the irradiated and control tibiae for the 2.47 Gy group. For cortical bone parameters, no effects were noticed for 1.65 and 0.83 Gy groups, but a lower Ct.Th was observed for 2.47 Gy group. Tibial bone development was adversely impacted and trabecular bone, together with bone marrow cells, were negatively affected by the 1.65 and 2.47 Gy radiation doses. Cortical bone microstructure was affected for 2.47 Gy group. However, bone development and morphometry were not affected for 0.83 Gy group. These findings can be used as a proof of concept for using the reasonable high-quality image acquisition under 0.83 Gy radiation doses during the adolescent period of rats without interfering with the bone development process."
https://openalex.org/W2901265228,"The debated question on the possible relation between the Earth’s magnetic field and climate has been usually focused on direct correlations between different time series representing both systems. However, the physical mechanism able to potentially explain this connection is still an open issue. Finding hints about how this connection could work would suppose an important advance in the search of an adequate physical mechanism. Here, we propose an innovative information-theoretic tool, i.e. the transfer entropy, as a good candidate for this scope because is able to determine, not simply the possible existence of a connection, but even the direction in which the link is produced. We have applied this new methodology to two real time series, the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) area extent at the Earth’s surface (representing the geomagnetic field system) and the Global Sea Level (GSL) rise (for the climate system) for the last 300 years, to measure the possible information flow and sense between them. This connection was previously suggested considering only the long-term trend while now we study this possibility also in shorter scales. The new results seem to support this hypothesis, with more information transferred from the SAA to the GSL time series, with about 90% of confidence level. This result provides new clues on the existence of a link between the geomagnetic field and the Earth’s climate in the past and on the physical mechanism involved because, thanks to the application of the transfer entropy, we have determined that the sense of the connection seems to go from the system that produces geomagnetic field to the climate system. Of course, the connection does not mean that the geomagnetic field is fully responsible for the climate changes, rather that it is an important driving component to the variations of the climate."
https://openalex.org/W2901598824,"The transcriptional coactivator WW domain–binding protein 2 (WBP2) is an emerging oncogene and serves as a node between the signaling protein Wnt and other signaling molecules and pathways, including epidermal growth factor receptor, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor, and the Hippo pathway. The upstream regulation of WBP2 is well-studied, but its downstream activity remains unclear. Here, we elucidated WBP2’s role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), in which Wnt signaling is predominantly activated. Using RNAi coupled with RNA-Seq and MS analyses to identify Wnt/WBP2- and WBP2-dependent targets in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells, we found that WBP2 is required for the expression of a core set of genes in Wnt signaling. These included AXIN2, which was essential for Wnt/WBP2-mediated breast cancer growth and migration. WBP2 also regulated a much larger set of genes and proteins independently of Wnt, revealing that WBP2 primes cells to Wnt activity by up-regulating G protein pathway suppressor 1 (GPS1) and TRAF2- and NCK-interacting kinase (TNIK). GPS1 activated the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/Jun pathway, resulting in a positive feedback loop with TNIK that mediated Wnt-induced AXIN2 expression. WBP2 promoted TNBC growth by integrating JNK with Wnt signaling, and its expression profoundly influenced the sensitivity of TNBC to JNK/TNIK inhibitors. In conclusion, WBP2 links JNK to Wnt signaling in TNBC. GPS1 and TNIK are constituents of a WBP2-initiated cascade that primes responses to Wnt ligands and are also important for TNBC biology.

Transcription coactivator β-catenin is a key effector in this pathway (5Valenta T. Hausmann G. Basler K.

In the absence of Wnt, β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3 and targeted for β-TrCP-dependent ubiquitination and destruction in the cytoplasm. Upon Wnt stimulation, the GSK3 destruction complex is inhibited, leading to β-catenin stabilization and translocation into nucleus, where it potentiates transcription of target genes via TCF/LEF transcription factors (6Li V.S.

Although current evidences portray WBP2 to have pleotropic roles, knowledge on the mode of action of WBP2 remains confined to a limited set of genes and pathways. To better understand the molecular effects of WBP2, RNA-Seq and MS were performed to elucidate the Wnt/WBP2- and WBP2-dependent targets in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. Besides confirming the role of WBP2 as a mediator of Wnt signaling regulating known and novel gene targets including AXIN2, a new function for WBP2 as a primer of cellular response to Wnt ligand was discovered and validated through the elucidation of a signaling axis involving GPS1, JNK/Jun, and TNIK. WBP2 protein was demonstrated to be overexpressed in breast cancer in a recent study of >400 clinical samples (21Lim S.K. Lu S.Y. Kang S.A. Tan H.J. Li Z. Adrian Wee Z.N. Guan J.S.

To gain further insights into the deregulation of WBP2 in breast cancer, we analyzed the gene copy number alterations (CNA) and mRNA expression of the WBP2 gene in multiple large-scale breast cancer datasets such as TCGA and METABRIC. The results indicated that WBP2 is frequently amplified (4.1–25%) or gained (0–31.7%) in breast cancer patients, whereas deletion was barely present (Fig. 1A, Table 1). The TCGA dataset also reveals a positive association between WBP2 gene copy number and mRNA level (Fig. 1, B and C). On the other hand, the “genotype to outcome” Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to study the correlation of the WBP2 transcriptomic signature on patients’ survival. This approach was applied because WBP2 has been known to act as a transcriptional coactivator and as such a network of genes could be affected upon its gain/amplification. Considering that the effect of WBP2 gain/amplification could be eventually leveraged by a set of genes, this genotype to outcome survival analysis is believed to be superior to the use of WBP2 expression alone. The data showed that the transcriptomic signature (defined either by the up or down-regulated genes) derived from patients with WBP2 amplification correlates with worse survival (Fig. 1D, i and ii) (27Pongor L.

However, it is not clear to what extent the Wnt pathway is regulated by WBP2. To address this question, RNA-Seq was carried out on MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells because Wnt/β-catenin signaling is highly relevant to TNBC and MDA-MB-231 is one of the most responsive cell lines to WNT3A ligand (Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 2A, MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with lentivirus expressing three shRNAs: scrambled (scr) shRNA, WBP2 shRNA1 targeting the 3′-UTR region, and WBP2 shRNA2 targeting the coding region, respectively. The cells were further treated with control serum-free medium (O) or serum-free medium containing 200 ng/ml of recombinant WNT3A for 12 h. Silencing of WBP2 and activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling were effectively achieved (Fig. 2B). Total RNA was extracted from the cells and used for RNA-Seq analysis. In total, 19,301 genes were mapped across the 18 replicates. About 16,000 genes were detected with an expression value. Comparison of the gene expression profiles between the O and WNT3A-treated samples within the control group produced a complete list of Wnt target genes in MDA-MB-231 cells. Next, lists of Wnt target genes independent on WBP2 were obtained by identifying those genes that displayed expression changes following WNT3A treatment despite WBP2 knockdown. The role of WBP2 in the WNT3A-induced transcriptional program was defined by subtracting the WNT3A-responsive, WBP2-independent targets from the complete list. The following criteria were used to identify the Wnt-induced differentially expressed genes: expression should be induced by at least 2-fold upon WNT3A stimulation; p value has to be less than 0.001, and false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.01. Under this set of criteria, 34 genes were identified as Wnt/β-catenin target genes. The relatively small number of Wnt target genes is not surprising as various gene expression studies of the Wnt pathway in different cell lines identified target genes that range from 4 to about 200 in number (Table S1). It appears that Wnt/β-catenin activates distinct target genes in different cell types. To determine which of the 34 Wnt/β-catenin target genes were dependent on WBP2, we defined a criterion that the fold-induction by WNT3A stimulation must be reduced by at least 30% upon WBP2 depletion. A fold-change cutoff from 1.3 to 2 has been widely adopted in transcriptomic studies (28McCarthy D.J. Smyth G.K.

This study tackles this issue by means of the rubber hand illusion (RHI), a widely used experimental tool for investigating the sense of body ownership. There is ample literature on the RHI in young populations, but research on age-related changes in the RHI is still scarce. Here we extend the use of the RHI to examine the changes in the sense of body ownership related to healthy aging. Subjective reports (i.e., questionnaire) and proprioceptive drift were compared among young (n = 22, age range 20–22 years), middle-aged (n = 22, age range 44–55 years), and older adults (n = 22, age range 60–72 years). A stronger subjective experience of illusion was observed in the young and older adults as compared to the middle-aged. No differences in proprioceptive drift were found between the three groups. These findings are discussed in relation to: 1) different stages of development of perceptual and cognitive components of the sense of body ownership, and 2) compensatory mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2901773046,"Objective The aim of this paper is to investigate how doctors working in primary health care in Latin American address patients with common mental disorders and to investigate how stigma can affect their clinical decisions. Methods Using a cross-sectional design, we applied an online self-administered questionnaire to a sample of 550 Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) from Bolivia, Brazil, Cuba and Chile. The questionnaire collected information about sociodemographic variables, training and experience with mental health care. Clinicians’ stigmatizing attitudes towards mental health were measured using the Mental Illness Clinicians' Attitudes Scale (MICA v4). The clinical decisions of PCPs were assessed through three clinical vignettes representing typical cases of depression, anxiety and somatization. Results A total of 387 professionals completed the questionnaires (70.3% response rate). The 63.7% of the PCPs felt qualified to diagnose and treat people with common mental disorders. More than 90% of the PCPs from Bolivia, Cuba and Chile agreed to treat the patients presented in the three vignettes. We did not find significant differences between the four countries in the scores of the MICA v4 stigma levels, with a mean = 36.3 and SD = 8.3 for all four countries. Gender (p = .672), age (p = .171), training (p = .673) and years of experience (p = .28) were unrelated to stigma. In the two multivariate regression models, PCPs with high levels of stigma were more likely to refer them to a psychiatrist the patients with depression (OR = 1.03, 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.07 p<0.05) and somatoform symptoms somatoform (OR = 1.03, 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.07, p<0.05) to a psychiatrist. Discussion The majority of PCPs in the four countries were inclined to treat patients with depression, anxiety and somatoform symptoms. PCPs with more levels of stigma were more likely to refer the patients with depression and somatoform symptoms to a psychiatrist. Stigmatizing attitudes towards mental disorders by PCPs might be important barriers for people with mental health problems to receive the treatment they need in primary care."
https://openalex.org/W2901733938,"Background The prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) is high (54%) in Bangladesh. Moreover, female garment workers report higher rates of IPV and are also vulnerable to workplace violence (WPV). Experience of violence puts women at increased risk of developing depressive symptoms, which are related with low self-esteem, lower life satisfaction and lower productivity. To our knowledge, there has been no previous research on depression among female garment workers and its connections to IPV and WPV in Bangladesh. This paper aims to address this gap by studying the relationship of IPV, WPV and depression among female garment workers. Methods The data for this paper comes from a cross-sectional survey of female garment workers (n = 800) conducted as baseline survey of a quasi-experimental study known as HERrespect. Survey data were collected during September-December, 2016 among randomly selected female garment workers from eight garment factories in and around Dhaka city. Structural equation modelling was conducted to explore the relationship among IPV, WPV and depression. Results The findings show high rates of any IPV (69%); WPV (73%, experienced or witnessed) and depressive symptomatology (40%) among female garment workers. The analysis of pathways shows that IPV impacts a woman’s experience of WPV and work related stress leading to the development of depression; while WPV had direct and mediated pathways to depression. Experience of controlling by their husband leads to WPV and increased work related stress, and thus leads to depression. It also reveals that a worker’s ability to mobilize resources in emergency, however, increased self-esteem and reduced work related stress. Conclusion This study shows the pathways through which experience of IPV and WPV lead to development of depressive symptoms among female garment workers. The link between women’s ability to mobilize resources with self-esteem and work related stress indicates the need for socio-economic empowerment of women and may suggest that combined intervention to address IPV and women’s empowerment could be successful in dealing with WPV and mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2901051898,"The ability to produce large quantities of recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (rAAV) vectors is an important factor for the development of gene therapy-based medicine. The baculovirus/insect cell expression system is one of the major systems for large scale rAAV production. So far, most technological developments concerned the optimization of the AAV rep and cap genes in order to be expressed correctly in a heterologous system. However, the effect of the baculovirus infection on the production of rAAV has not been examined in detail. In this study we show that the baculoviral cathepsin (v-CATH) protease is active on several (but not all) rAAV serotypes, leading to a partial degradation of VP1/VP2 proteins. Subsequently, we identified the principal v-CATH cleavage site in the rAAV8 capsid proteins and demonstrated that the cleavage is highly specific. The proteolytic degradation of VP1/VP2 AAV capsid proteins reduces the infectivity of rAAV vectors but can be prevented by the use of a baculovirus vector with a deletion of the chiA/v-cath locus or by addition of the E64 protease inhibitor during production. Moreover, the codon optimization of AAV cap performed for several serotypes and originally aimed at the removal of potential alternative initiation codons, resulted in incorporation of additional forms of truncated VP1 into the rAAV capsids."
https://openalex.org/W2901104932,"Observing others' actions desynchronizes electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms and modulates corticospinal excitability as assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). However, it remains unclear if these measures reflect similar neurofunctional mechanisms at the individual level. In the present study, a within-subject experiment was designed to assess these two neurophysiological indexes and to quantify their mutual correlation. Participants observed reach-to-grasp actions directed towards a small (precision grip) or a large object (power grip). We focused on two specific time points for both EEG and TMS. The first time point (t1) coincided with the maximum hand aperture, i.e. the moment at which a significant modulation of corticospinal excitability is expected. The second (t2), coincided with the EEG resynchronization occurring at the end of the action, i.e. the moment at which a hypothetic minimum for action observation effect is expected. Results showed a Mu rhythm bilateral desynchronization at t1 with differential resynchronization at t2 in the two hemispheres. Beta rhythm was more desynchronized in the left hemisphere at both time points. These EEG differences, however, were not influenced by grip type. Conversely, motor potentials evoked by TMS in an intrinsic hand muscle revealed an interaction effect of grip and time. No significant correlations between Mu/Beta rhythms and motor evoked potentials were found. These findings are discussed considering the spatial and temporal resolution of the two investigated techniques and argue over two alternative explanations: i. each technique provides different measures of the same process or ii. they describe complementary features of the action observation network in humans."

Despite this vital role, there is limited information on the genetic diversity and BNF of bacteria nodulating common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). This study evaluated the genetic diversity and symbiotic nitrogen fixation of bacteria nodulating common bean in soils of Western Kenya. The genetic diversity was determined using 16S rRNA gene partial sequences while BNF was estimated in a greenhouse experiment. The sequences of the native isolates were closely affiliated with members from the genera Pantoea, Klebsiella, Rhizobium, Enterobacter and Bacillus. These results show that apart from rhizobia, there are non-rhizobial strains in the nodules of common bean. The symbiotic efficiency (SE) of native isolates varied and exhibited comparable or superior BNF compared to the local commercial inoculants (CIAT 899 and Strain 446). Isolates (MMUST 003 [KP027691], MMUST 004 [KP027687], MMUST 005 [KP027688], KSM 001 [KP027682], KSM 002 [KP027680], KSM 003 [KP027683] and KSM 005 [KP027685]) recorded equal or significantly higher SE (p < 0.05) compared to N supplemented treatments. The results demonstrate the presence of genetic diversity of native bacteria nodulating bean that are effective in N fixation. These elite bacterial strains should be exploited as candidates for the development of Phaseolus vulgaris inoculants."

The overall EAR was 16.4 per 10,000 PYR. The most common types of SMNs, in order of incidence, were other malignant epithelial neoplasms, leukemia, and soft tissue sarcomas. The cumulative incidence of developing SMNs was 0.7% at 5 years, 1.2% at 10 years, and 2% at 15 years. After primary cancer diagnosis, the 10-year overall survival rate of patients with SMNs was 65.1%, which was lower than the 73.4% in patients without SMN. After SMN diagnosis, the 10-year overall survival rate was 55.8%.Through this registry-based study of 5.6 years of follow up, childhood cancer survivors were found to be at 20-fold higher risk of developing a malignant neoplasm compared to the general population. The majority of malignant neoplasms are malignant epithelial neoplasms, leukemia, and soft tissue sarcomas. Continued surveillance for assessing long-term risks, and guidance for appropriate long-term follow up of childhood cancer survivors, are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2900899200,"Very long intergenic non-coding RNAs (vlincRNAs) are a novel class of long transcripts (~50 kb to 1 Mb) with cell type- or cancer-specific expression. We report the discovery and characterization of 256 vlincRNAs from a cohort of 64 primary childhood pre-B and pre-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) samples, of which 61% are novel and specifically expressed in cALL. Validation was performed in 35 pre-B and pre-T cALL primary samples. We show that their expression is cALL immunophenotype and molecular subtype-specific and correlated with epigenetic modifications on their promoters, much like protein-coding genes. While the biological functions of these vlincRNAs are still unknown, our results suggest they could play a role in cALL etiology or progression."
https://openalex.org/W2901291913,"The equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) ORF1 and ORF71 genes have immune modulatory effects in vitro. Experimental infection of horses using virus mutants with multiple deletions including ORF1 and ORF71 showed promise as vaccine candidates against EHV-1. Here, the combined effects of ORF1 and ORF71 deletions from the neuropathogenic EHV-1 strain Ab4 on clinical disease and host immune response were further explored. Three groups of EHV-1 naïve horses were experimentally infected with the ORF1/71 gene deletion mutant (Ab4ΔORF1/71), the parent Ab4 strain, or remained uninfected. In comparison to Ab4, horses infected with Ab4ΔORF1/71 did not show the initial high fever peak characteristic of EHV-1 infection. Ab4ΔORF1/71 infection had reduced nasal shedding (1/5 vs. 5/5) and, simultaneously, decreased intranasal interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-10 and soluble CD14 secretion. However, Ab4 and Ab4ΔORF1/71 infection resulted in comparable viremia, suggesting these genes do not regulate the infection of the mononuclear cells and subsequent viremia. Intranasal and serum anti-EHV-1 antibodies to Ab4ΔORF1/71 developed slightly slower than those to Ab4. However, beyond day 12 post infection (d12pi) serum antibodies in both virus-infected groups were similar and remained increased until the end of the study (d114pi). EHV-1 immunoglobulin (Ig) G isotype responses were dominated by short-lasting IgG1 and long-lasting IgG4/7 antibodies. The IgG4/7 response closely resembled the total EHV-1 specific antibody response. Ex vivo re-stimulation of PBMC with Ab4 resulted in IFN-γ and IL-10 secretion by cells from both infected groups within two weeks pi. Flow cytometric analysis showed that IFN-γ producing EHV-1-specific T-cells were mainly CD8+/IFN-γ+ and detectable from d32pi on. Peripheral blood IFN-γ+ T-cell percentages were similar in both infected groups, albeit at low frequency (~0.1%). In summary, the Ab4ΔORF1/71 gene deletion mutant is less virulent but induced antibody responses and cellular immunity similar to the parent Ab4 strain."
https://openalex.org/W2901863390,"The aim of this study was to analyze the metabolome of several Klebsiella pneumoniae strains characterized by different resistance patterns. A total of 59 bacterial strains (27 carbapenemase-negative and 32 carbapenemase-positive) were included and their metabolic features were assessed in basal conditions. Moreover, 8 isolates (4 wild-type and 4 KPC-producers) were randomly selected to evaluate the impact of sub-lethal concentrations of meropenem on bacterial metabolism. The metabolomic analysis was performed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy both on filtered supernatants and cell lysates. A total of 40 and 20 molecules were quantified in the intracellular and the extracellular metabolome, respectively. While in basal conditions only five metabolites showed significant differences between carbapenemase-positive and negative strains, the use of meropenem had a profound impact on the whole bacterial metabolism. In the intracellular compartment, a reduction of different overflow metabolites and organic acids (e.g. formate, acetate, isobutyrate) was noticed, whereas, in the extracellular metabolome, the levels of several organic acids (e.g. succinate, acetate, formate, lactate) and amino acids (aspartate, threonine, lysine, alanine) were modified by meropenem stimulation. Interestingly, carbapenemase-positive and negative strains reacted differently to meropenem in terms of number and type of perturbed metabolites. In wild-type strains, meropenem had great impact on the metabolic pathways related to methane metabolism and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, whereas in KPC-producers the effect was predominant on pyruvate metabolism. The knowledge about the bacterial metabolic profiles could help to set up innovative diagnostic methods and new antimicrobial strategies to fight the global crisis against carbapenemase-positive K. pneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W2900606375,"Relocation is one of the mitigating measures taken by either local people or related officers to reduce the human-bonnet macaque Macaca radiata conflict in India. The review on relocations of primates in India indicates that monkeys are unscreened for diseases or gastrointestinal parasites (henceforth endoparasites) before relocation. We collected 161 spatial samples from 20 groups of bonnet macaque across their distribution range in south India and 205 temporal samples from a group in Chiksuli in the central Western Ghats. The isolation of endoparasite eggs/cysts from the fecal samples was by the centrifugation flotation and sedimentation method. All the sampled groups, except one, had an infection of at least one endoparasite taxa, and a total of 21 endoparasite taxon were recorded. The number of helminth taxon (16) were more than protozoan (5), further, among helminths, nematodes (11) were more common than cestodes (5). Although the prevalence of Ascaris sp. (26.0%), Strongyloides sp. (13.0%), and Coccidia sp. (13.0%) were greater, the load of Entamoeba coli, Giardia sp., Dipylidium caninum and Diphyllobothrium sp. were very high. Distant groups had more similarity in composition of endoparasites taxon than closely located groups. Among all the variables, the degree of provisioning was the topmost determinant factor for the endoparasite taxon richness and their load. Temporal sampling indicates that the endoparasite infection remains continuous throughout the year. Monthly rainfall and average maximum temperature in the month did not influence the endoparasite richness. A total of 17 taxon of helminths and four-taxon of protozoan were recorded. The prevalence of Oesophagostomum sp., and Strongyloides sp., and mean egg load of Spirurids and Trichuris sp. was higher than other endoparasite taxon. The overall endoparasite load and helminth load was higher in immatures than adults, where, adult females had the highest protozoan load in the monsoon. The findings indicate that relocation of commensal bonnet macaque to wild habitat can possible to lead transmission of novel endoparasites that can affect their population. Thus, we suggest avoidance of such relocations, however, if inevitable the captured animals need to be screened and treated for diseases and endoparasites before relocations."
https://openalex.org/W2900935164,"There are different opinions of the clinical value of MRS of the brain. In selected materials MRS has demonstrated good results for characterisation of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the supplemental value of MR spectroscopy (MRS) in a clinical setting.MRI and MRS were re-evaluated in 208 cases with a clinically indicated MRS (cases with uncertain or insufficient information on MRI) and a confirmed diagnosis. Both single voxel spectroscopy (SVS) and chemical shift imaging (CSI) were performed in 105 cases, only SVS or CSI in 54 and 49 cases, respectively. Diagnoses were grouped into categories: non-neoplastic disease, low-grade tumour, and high-grade tumour. The clinical value of MRS was considered very beneficial if it provided the correct category or location when MRI did not, beneficial if it ruled out suspected diseases or was more specific than MRI, inconsequential if it provided the same level of information, or misleading if it provided less or incorrect information.There were 70 non-neoplastic lesions, 43 low-grade tumours, and 95 high-grade tumours. For MRI, the category was correct in 130 cases (62%), indeterminate in 39 cases (19%), and incorrect in 39 cases (19%). Supplemented with MRS, 134 cases (64%) were correct, 23 cases (11%) indeterminate, and 51 (25%) incorrect. Additional information from MRS was beneficial or very beneficial in 31 cases (15%) and misleading in 36 cases (17%).In most cases MRS did not add to the diagnostic value of MRI. In selected cases, MRS may be a valuable supplement to MRI."
https://openalex.org/W2901030134,"Philodendron s.l. (Araceae) has been recently focus of taxonomic and phylogenetic studies, but karyotypic data are limited to chromosome numbers and a few published genome sizes. In this work, karyotypes of 34 species of Philodendron s.l. (29 species of Philodendron and five of Thaumatophyllum), ranging from 2n = 28 to 36 chromosomes, were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with rDNA and telomeric probes, aiming to understand the evolution of the karyotype diversity of the group. Philodendron presented a high number variation of 35S rDNA, ranging from two to 16 sites, which were mostly in the terminal region of the short arms, with nine species presenting heteromorphisms. In the case of Thaumatophyllum species, we observed a considerably lower variation, which ranged from two to four terminal sites. The distribution of the 5S rDNA clusters was more conserved, with two sites for most species, being preferably located interstitially in the long chromosome arms. For the telomeric probe, while exclusively terminal sites were observed for P. giganteum (2n = 30) chromosomes, P. callosum (2n = 28) presented an interstitial distribution associated with satellite DNA. rDNA sites of the analyzed species of Philodendron s.l. species were randomly distributed considering the phylogenetic context, probably due to rapid evolution and great diversity of these genomes. The observed heteromorphisms suggest the accumulation of repetitive DNA in the genomes of some species and the occurrence of chromosomal rearrangements along the karyotype evolution of the group."
https://openalex.org/W2901485083,"Background Aiming to eliminate HIV infection, UNAIDS has set a global “90-90-90” target by 2020. We sought to construct a 6-stages HIV Cascade of Care (CoC) in Greece, overall and by risk group, to assess risk-group and stage-specific progress in achieving the UNAIDS target. Patients and methods Combining data from the HIV/AIDS surveillance system and a population-based HIV cohort study, the CoC included: i) number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) by end of 2013; ii) proportion of PLHIV ever diagnosed; iii) proportion of diagnosed linked-to-care iv) proportion of linked-to-care ever initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART); v) proportion of treated who retained-in-care vi) proportion of those retained-in-care who were virally suppressed (≤200 copies/mL) at their last visit (01/07/2012-31/12/2013). Results In 2013, 14147 PLHIV were in Greece. Overall, proportions of each stage in the cascade were: 78.4% diagnosed; 86% linked-to-care; 78.5% initiated ART; 86.4% retained-in-care, and 87.1% virally suppressed. Totally, 42.6% of all PLHIV were virally suppressed. The percentage diagnosed was lower among heterosexual men and women (heterosexuals) than in MSM (men who have sex with men) or PWID (people who inject drugs). Most MSM were linked to care (97.2% of diagnosed) while a substantial proportion of PWID were not (80.8% of diagnosed). Once treated, PWID remained in care in similar proportions to MSM. Unlike PWID, a high proportion of the retained in care MSM and heterosexuals achieved viral suppression. Conclusions At the end of 2013, we identified gaps in the HIV CoC in Greece, which differed across risk groups. Targeted interventions are critical in optimizing early diagnosis and timely linkage. A 6-stage CoC, stratified by risk group, can inform strategic public health planning in improving HIV treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2901421728,"Modulation or prevention of protein changes during the cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) process induced by Opisthorchis viverrini (Ov) infection may become a key strategy for prevention and treatment of CCA. Monitoring of such changes could lead to discovery of protein targets for CCA treatment. Curcumin exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-CCA activities partly through its protein-modulatory ability. To support the potential use of curcumin and to discover novel target molecules for CCA treatment, we used a quantitative proteomic approach to investigate the effects of curcumin on protein changes in an Ov-induced CCA-harboring hamster model. Isobaric labelling and tandem mass spectrometry were used to compare the protein expression profiles of liver tissues from CCA hamsters with or without curcumin dietary supplementation. Among the dysregulated proteins, five were upregulated in liver tissues of CCA hamsters but markedly downregulated in the CCA hamsters supplemented with curcumin: S100A6, lumican, plastin-2, 14-3-3 zeta/delta and vimentin. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses also showed similar expression patterns of these proteins in liver tissues of hamsters in the CCA and CCA + curcumin groups. Proteins such as clusterin and S100A10, involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway, an important signaling cascade involved in CCA genesis, were also upregulated in CCA hamsters and were then suppressed by curcumin treatment. Taken together, our results demonstrate the important changes in the proteome during the genesis of O. viverrini-induced CCA and provide an insight into the possible protein targets for prevention and treatment of this cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2952467605,"Standard methods for seeding monolayer cell cultures in a multiwell plate or dish do not uniformly distribute cells on the surface. With traditional methods, users find aggregation around the circumference, in the centre, or a combination of the two. This variation is introduced due to the macro scale flow of the cell seeding suspension, and movement of the dish before cells can settle and attach to the surface. Reproducibility between labs, users, and experiments is hampered by this variability in cell seeding. We present a simple method for uniform and user-independent the cell seeding using an easily produced uniform cell seeder (UCS) device. This allows precise control of cell density in a reproducible manner. By containing the cell seeding suspension in a defined volume above the culture surface with the UCS, fluctuations in cell density are minimised. Seeding accuracy, as defined by the actual cell density versus the target seeding density is improved dramatically across users with various levels of expertise. We go on to demonstrate the impact of local variation in cell density on the lineage commitment of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) towards pancreatic endoderm (PE). Variations in the differentiation profile of cells across a culture well closely mirror variations in cell density introduced by seeding method–with the UCS correcting variations in differentiation efficiency. The UCS device provides a simple and reproducible method for uniform seeding across multiple culture systems."
https://openalex.org/W2900674770,"During myogenesis, myogenic stem cells undergo several sequential events, including cell division, migration, and cell-cell fusion, leading to the formation of multinuclear myotubes, which are the precursors of myofibers. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex processes, an RNA interference-based gene depletion approach was used. Golgi associated, gamma adaptin ear containing, ARF binding protein 1 (GGA1), a Golgi-resident monomeric clathrin adaptor, was found to be required for the process of myotube formation in C2C12 cells, a cultured murine myoblast cell line. Gga1 mRNA expression was upregulated during myogenesis, and Gga1 depletion prevented the formation of large multi-nucleated myotubes. Moreover, inhibition of lysosomal proteases in Gga1 knockdown myoblasts increased the amount of insulin receptor, suggesting that GGA1 is involved in the cell surface expression and sorting of the insulin receptor. These results suggested that GGA1 plays a significant role in the formation and maturation of myotubes by targeting the insulin receptor to the cell surface to establish functionally mature myofibers."
https://openalex.org/W2900656012,"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is an epithelial monolayer in the back of the vertebrate eye. RPE dysfunction is associated with retinal degeneration and blindness. In order to fully understand how dysregulation affects visual function, RPE-specific gene knockouts are indispensable. Since the currently available RPE-specific Cre recombinases show lack of specificity or poor recombination, we sought to generate an alternative. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible RPE-specific Cre transgenic mouse line under transcriptional control of an RPE-specific Tyrosinase enhancer. We characterized the Cre-mediated recombinant expression by crossing our RPE-Tyrosinase-CreErT2 mouse line with the tdTomato reporter line, Ai14. Detected fluorescence was quantified via high-content image analysis. Recombination was predominantly observed in the RPE and adjacent ciliary body. RPE flatmount preparations revealed a high level of recombination in adult mice (47.25–69.48%). Regional analysis of dorsal, ventral, nasal and temporal areas did not show significant changes in recombination. However, recombination was higher in the central RPE compared to the periphery. Higher levels of Cre-mediated recombinant expression was observed in embryonic RPE (~83%). Compared to other RPE-specific Cre transgenic mouse lines, this newly generated RPE-Tyrosinase-CreErT2 line shows a more uniform and higher level of recombination with the advantage to initiate recombination in both, prenatal and postnatal animals. This line can serve as a valuable tool for researches exploring the role of individual gene functions, in both developing and differentiated RPE."

Binary logistic regression was carried out to analyze the association between PUD and all variables in the crude analysis; in a subsequent analysis, adjustments were made for age, region, house type, number of snacks per day, and number of household members.PUD exhibited the highest association with age in both men and women among all variables used in this study. In men, only body mass index was associated with PUD in both the crude and adjusted analyses. PUD was associated with weight, height, and fat in the crude analysis, but these associations disappeared after adjustment for confounders. Vitamin B2, hemoglobin, and glucose were related to PUD, but these associations became nonsignificant in the adjusted analysis. Water, vitamin C, and potassium were not associated with PUD in the crude analysis but were associated with PUD after adjustment for confounders. In women, systolic blood pressure and height were associated with PUD. PUD was also related to waist circumference, the waist-to-height ratio, fat, and cholesterol, but these associations became nonsignificant after adjustment for confounders. Vitamin C, protein, niacin, sodium, energy, vitamin B2, vitamin B1, and aspartate aminotransferases were associated with PUD in only the crude analysis. PUD was not associated with diastolic blood pressure, water, vitamin A, or glucose, but these factors were associated with the disease in the adjusted analysis.Older age was a risk factor for PUD in Korean adults, and the association of PUD with most nutrients and anthropometric indices may differ according to gender."
https://openalex.org/W2901845544,"Irreversible cartilage collagen breakdown by the collagenolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-1 and MMP-13 represents a key event in pathologies associated with tissue destruction such as arthritis. Inflammation is closely associated with such pathology and occurs in both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis making it highly relevant to the prevailing tissue damage that characterises these diseases. The inflammation-induced activating protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor is an important regulator of both MMP1 and MMP13 genes with interplay between signalling pathways contributing to their expression. Here, we have examined the regulation of MMP1 expression, and using in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses we have demonstrated that cFos bound to the AP-1 cis element within the proximal MMP1 promoter only when the gene was transcriptionally silent as previously observed for MMP13. Subsequent small interfering RNA-mediated silencing confirmed however, that cFos significantly contributes to MMP1 expression. In contrast, silencing of ATF3 (a prime MMP13 modulator) did not affect MMP1 expression whilst silencing of the Wnt-associated regulator cysteine- serine-rich nuclear protein-1 (CSRNP1) resulted in substantial repression of MMP1 but not MMP13. Furthermore, following an early transient peak in expression of CSRNP1 at the mRNA and protein levels similar to that seen for cFOS, CSRNP1 expression subsequently persisted unlike cFOS. Finally, DNA binding assays indicated that the binding of CSRNP1 to the AP-1 consensus-like sequences within the proximal promoter regions of MMP1 and MMP13 was preferentially selective for MMP1 whilst activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) binding was exclusive to MMP13. These data further extend our understanding of the previously reported differential regulation of these MMP genes, and strongly indicate that although cFos modulates the expression of MMP1/13, downstream factors such as CSRNP1 and ATF3 ultimately serve as transcriptional regulators in the context of an inflammatory stimulus for these potent collagenolytic MMPs."
https://openalex.org/W2901142407,"Introduction Middle ear application of gentamicin is a common medical treatment for uncontrolled Ménière’s disease. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of endolymphatic hydrops on inner ear delivery. Methods Perilymph gentamicin concentrations and correlation with endolymphatic hydrops in an animal model were assessed. A group of 24 guinea pigs was submitted to surgical obstruction of the endolymphatic sac and duct of the right ear. Gentamicin was applied either to the right ear’s round window niche or through a transtympanic injection. Perilymph specimens were collected at different times. Histologic morphometry was used to evaluate both turn-specific and overall hydrops degree. Results In animals with endolymphatic hydrops, lower concentrations of gentamicin were observed after 20 or 120 minutes of exposure and in both types of administration, when compared to controls. This difference reached statistical significance in the round window niche application group (Mann-Whitney, p = 0,007). A negative correlation between perilymphatic gentamicin concentration and hydrops degree could be observed in both groups, after 120 minutes of exposure (Spearman correlation, round window niche p<0,001; TT p = 0,005). Conclusions The study indicates that the endolymphatic hydrops degree has a negative interference on the delivery of gentamicin into the inner ear following middle ear application."
https://openalex.org/W2901554664,"Kangaroo mother care, an evidence based practice and a national policy for management of low birth weight newborns in Nepal, is not widely practiced. This implementation research study aimed to explore the consumer preference and acceptability of the traditional and a new ergonomic wrap on the continuation of kangaroo mother care in the facility and community following discharge.A mixed method feasibility study was done from May to October 2015. Ninety-six families of stable low birth weight newborns weighing 1800 to 2499 grams were counseled and taught to practice kangaroo mother care using both wraps. They were randomized into two groups of 48 with one group trying out the traditional wrap for the first six hours and the new wrap for the next six, and vice versa. Mothers were allowed to choose between the wraps for continuation of kangaroo mother care at the facility and post discharge. They were followed up telephonically weekly over 28 days postpartum to ascertain practice of kangaroo mother care. In-depth interviews with mothers (n = 12) and focus group discussions with health workers (n = 16) further evaluated the intervention. Descriptive statistics are presented for the quantitative part of the study.Mothers in the two groups chose the new wrap with no significant difference (81.3% vs 89.6%, p = 0.24). Of the 96 randomized mothers, 85% chose the new wrap. During the hospital stay, six mothers dropped out and remaining 90 mothers who were discharged with the intention of continuing Kangaroo Mother Care, 78 and 12 mothers did so with the new and traditional wrap respectively. New wrap users (429.1 hours, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 351.7-470.3) performed skin-to-skin contact for an extra 77.4 hours overall than traditional wrap (351.7 hours, 95%CI: 259.3-444) users from first day to 28 day postpartum. Health workers and mothers reported positive experience with the new wrap as it was easy to wear without assistance, secure and flexible to move around in kangaroo mother care position.Involvement of mothers and families with provision of ergonomic wraps showed improvement in kangaroo mother care practice during hospital stay and at home."

In this study our objective was 1) To retrospectively apply the online calculator (tstin3d.com) to determine the probability of having LTBI and assign cumulative risk of progression. 2) Measure treatment outcomes in subjects with Low: 0-<10%, Intermediate: 10-<50% and High: 50–100% cumulative risk. We performed medical record review of tuberculin skin test and/or Interferon-γ release assay (IGRAs) positive patients with LTBI seen from 2010–2015. Of 125 subjects included, 51(41%), 46 (37%) and 28 (22%) subjects were in Low, Intermediate and High risk groups respectively. Tstin3d.com was useful in determining the probability of LTBI in tuberculin skin test positive US-born subjects. Overall treatment completion rate was 61% in 114 subjects with complete treatment information and similar completion rates were seen in the three groups (Low-60%, Intermediate-63% and High-57%). Provider assessment of important clinical risk factors was often incomplete. Logistic regression analysis showed no association of assessment of important risk factors with treatment completion. The major limitations of the calculator are the lack of an updated data on country-specific prevalence of TB disease as the global burden of TB continues to decrease as well as falsely high positive predictive values that due to “transiently” positive IGRA results in subjects from countries with low prevalence. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that tstin3d.com could be utilized in the US setting for improving providing awareness of risk stratification of patients with LTBI for short course treatment regimens based on risk."
https://openalex.org/W2900487184,"Background Smallpox vaccinations were stopped globally in 1980. Recent studies have shown that in women, being smallpox vaccinated was associated with a reduced risk of HIV infection compared with not being smallpox vaccinated. At the initial infection, HIV-1 most often uses CCR5 as a co-receptor to infect the T-lymphocytes. We therefore investigated whether smallpox vaccination is associated with a down-regulation of CCR5 on the surface of peripheral T-lymphocytes in healthy women in Guinea-Bissau. Methods We included HIV seronegative women from Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, born before 1974, with and without a smallpox vaccination scar. Blood samples were stabilised in a TransFix buffer solution and stained for flow cytometry according to a T-cell maturation profile. Results Ninety-seven women were included in the study; 52 with a smallpox vaccination scar and 45 without a scar. No association between smallpox vaccination scar and CCR5 expression was found in any T-lymphocyte subtype. Conclusion Among HIV seronegative women, being smallpox vaccinated more than 40 years ago was not associated with a down-regulation of CCR5 receptors on the surface of peripheral T-lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2900693976,"Outbreaks of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 viruses have spurred an unprecedented research effort to develop antivirals and vaccines against influenza. Standardized methods for vaccine evaluation are critical for facilitating vaccine development. Compared with hemagglutination inhibition assays, mounting evidence suggest that microneutralization tests (MNTs) is a better choice for the evaluation of candidate pandemic influenza vaccines because they measure neutralizing antibody activity in cell cultures and are more sensitive in detecting H5 and H7. Here, we report a MNT measuring neuraminidase activity as the read-out (NA-MNT) for quantitative analysis of neutralizing antibodies against avian influenza viruses. Compared to the conventional microneutralization assay (ELISA-MNT), the NA-MNT is faster with lower intra- and inter-assay variations, while no difference in geometric mean titers was found between these two assays for the evaluation of H5N1 and H7N9 vaccines. These results suggest that NA-MNT is a reliable and high throughput method which could facilitate the development of candidate pandemic influenza vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2901863453,"During reproduction, vitellogenin (Vg), as an egg yolk precursor, is critical in sexually mature females of oviparous species including some insects. The transcription of Vg is usually mediated by hormones such as juvenile hormone (JH), ecdysteroids and some neuropeptides. In this study, the structure of the Vg gene from the bumblebee Bombus lantschouensis, (BlVg) was determined by sequencing and assembly. BlVg was found to be expressed at higher levels in reproductive queens than in virgins by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Tissue-specific expression analysis showed that BlVg was expressed at the highest levels in the fat bodies of both virgin and reproductive queens. Prediction of the BlVg promoter revealed the presence of ecdysteroid-responsive cis-regulatory elements (CREs) containing one Broad-Complex zinc-finger isoform 3 (BR-C Z3), and one ecdysone-induced protein 74A (E74A). In addition, luciferase reporter expression, driven by the 5' -regulatory region of the BlVg gene, from −1517 bp to +895 bp downstream of the start codon, was induced by treatment with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-E). Moreover, the luciferase activity of the BlVg promoter was elevated by only BlBrC-Z3 when Sf9 cells were cotransfected with four BlBrC isoforms respectively. BlVg promoter-mediated luciferase activation was significantly reduced when the putative BrC-Z3 CRE in the promoter was mutated. In summary, this report describes the first study of vitellogenin gene regulation at the transcriptional level in bumblebees and demonstrates that the ecdysone-induced transcription of the BlVg gene is mediated by the binding of BlBrC-Z3 to the BrC-Z3 CRE in the BlVg promoter in bumblebees."

Eleven experienced capoeira practitioners underwent the following procedures in different days: 1) anamnesis and anthropometric measurements; 2) aerobic performance assessment; 3 to 5) performances of 90 seconds in three capoeira styles (Angola, Benguela and São Bento), which were performed in randomized controlled cross-over design. The psychophysiological demand was assessed through the heart rate (HR), R-R interval (RRi), blood pressure (BP), blood lactate ([Lac]), blood glucose ([Gluc]), rating perceived effort (RPE), feeling scale (FS) and perceived activation (PA). Descriptive statistics with mean and standard deviation was performed. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test was used. The Angola demand was between 56–71% maximal HR with [Lac]PEAK: 6.9±2.9 mM, RPEPEAK: 10.0±2.2 pts and FS: 2.7±1.7 pts, while in the Benguela participants reached 64–85% maximal HR with [Lac]PEAK: 9.5±3.0 mM, RPEPEAK: 11.0±2.8 pts and FS: 2.1±1.6 pts and for São Bento between 69–102% maximal HR with [Lac]PEAK: 15.7±2.6 mM, RPEPEAK: 15.5±4.1 pts and FS: -0.8±3.0 pts. Interaction time*performance occurred to [Lac] (F = 42.157; p<0.001), HR (F = 12.154; p<0.001), RRi (F = 4.774; p<0.001), parasympathetic modulation-rMSSD (F = 3.189; p<0.01), [Gluc] (F = 2.152; p<0.05), RPE (F = 5.855; p<0.01), FS (F = 2.448; p<0.05) and PA (F = 3.893; p<0.05). We concluded that São Bento rhythm resulted in a greater physiological demand according to the HR, [Lac] and cardiac autonomic indicators, with the Benguela rhythm being intermediate while the Angola rhythm presented a reduced demand. The [Gluc] increased after the São Bento rhythm when compared to the other rhythms. The perceptual demand presented increased in terms of RPE and PA variables and decreased in terms of FS when the São Bento performance was analyzed in comparison to the Angola and/or Benguela in capoeira."
https://openalex.org/W2901891735,"Numerous observations have suggested a connection between the maintenance of cell polarity and control of cell proliferation; however, the mechanisms underlying these connections remain poorly understood. Here we found that ectopic expression of CRB3, which was previously shown to restore tight junctions and membrane polarity in MCF-10A cells, induced a hyperproliferative phenotype, with significantly enlarged acini in basement membrane culture, similar to structures induced by expression of proliferative oncogenes such as cyclinD1. We found that CRB3-induced proliferation is epidermal growth factor (EGF)-independent and occurs through a mechanism that involves secretion of the EGF-family ligand, amphiregulin (AREG). The increase in AREG secretion is associated with an increase in the number and size of both early and late endosomes. Both the proliferative and endocytic phenotypes associated with CRB3 expression require the FERM-binding domain (FBD) but not the PDZ-binding domain of CRB3, arguing that this proliferative phenotype is independent of the PDZ-dependent polarity signaling by CRB3. We identified the FBD-containing protein, EPB41L4B, as an essential mediator of CRB3-driven proliferation and observed that the CRB3-dependent changes in endocytic trafficking were also dependent on EPB41L4B. Taken together, these data reveal a previously uncharacterized role for CRB3 in regulating proliferation in mammalian cells that is associated with changes in the endocytic trafficking machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2900653118,"Objective To (1) characterise the chemical and ultra-structural composition of ameroid constrictors, at a native state and during in vitro expansion and (2) determine the presence of irritant compounds at the surface or within the bulk of the constrictor. Methods Twelve sterile, commercially packaged ameroid constrictors (3 repeats of 3.5 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm and 7 mm internal diameter) were analysed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Results Ameroid constrictors have a composition commensurate with casein with little-to-no intra- or inter- constrictor variation. Microscopic analysis indicated that the topographical features of the constrictor surfaces were consistent between all constrictors. Following in vitro expansion there was a reproducible decrease in Ca+ ion content, little-to-no variation in secondary protein structure and morphological changes including the presence of surface aggregates present only at the inner surface of the ameroid constrictor. The potential irritant polydimethylsiloxane was found on the constrictor surface. A trace quantity of an ion fragment assigned as formaldehyde was detected; however, the extremely low level is thought highly unlikely to play a role as an inflammatory trigger clinically. Discussion There is a high degree of inter- and intra-constrictor homogeneity from different batches, and reproducible ultrastructural changes following in vitro expansion. Variations occur in both the surface chemistry and topography of the device during closure, which can potentially affect the biomaterial-host interface. Ameroid constrictor closure mechanism is likely involving calcium-mediated inter-protein interactions rather than the imbibition of water only."
https://openalex.org/W2900755565,"Respondent-driven detection is a chain recruitment method used to sample contact persons of infected persons in order to enhance case finding. It starts with initial individuals, so-called seeds, who are invited for participation. Afterwards, seeds receive a fixed number of coupons to invite individuals with whom they had contact during a specific time period. Recruitees are then asked to do the same, resulting in successive waves of contact persons who are connected in one recruitment tree. However, often the majority of participants fail to invite others, or invitees do not accept an invitation, and recruitment stops after several waves. A mathematical model can help to analyse how various factors influence peer recruitment and to understand under which circumstances sustainable recruitment is possible. We implemented a stochastic simulation model, where parameters were suggested by empirical data from an online survey, to determine the thresholds for obtaining large recruitment trees and the number of waves needed to reach a steady state in the sample composition for individual characteristics. We also examined the relationship between mean and variance of the number of invitations sent out by participants and the probability of obtaining a large recruitment tree. Our main finding is that a situation where participants send out any number of coupons between one and the maximum number is more effective in reaching large recruitment trees, compared to a situation where the majority of participants does not send out any invitations and a smaller group sends out the maximum number of invitations. The presented model is a helpful tool that can assist public health professionals in preparing research and contact tracing using online respondent-driven detection. In particular, it can provide information on the required minimum number of successfully sent invitations to reach large recruitment trees, a certain sample composition or certain number of waves."
https://openalex.org/W2900940584,"An international team of scientists this week reported a startling new discovery hidden beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet: a 31-kilometer-wide impact crater, big enough to swallow Washington, D.C., left after a 1.5-kilometer-wide asteroid slammed into Earth. One of the planet9s 25 largest-known craters, it is also remarkably fresh, seemingly indicating a recent strike within the last few million years. Though not as cataclysmic as the dinosaur-killing Chicxulub impact 66 million years ago, the Hiawatha impactor, as it9s known, may have left an imprint on the planet9s history. The timing is still up for debate, but some researchers on the discovery team believe the asteroid struck at a crucial moment: roughly 13,000 years ago, just as the world was thawing from the last ice age. That would mean it crashed into Earth when mammoths and other megafauna were in decline and people were spreading across North America."
https://openalex.org/W2901405943,"In 2001, the woodwasp Sirex noctilio was detected in Pinus radiata plantations in the Biobio region of southern Chile. Subsequently, an intense biological control program using the female sterilizing nematode Deladenus siricidicola was implemented in 2010. During five seasons between 2012 and 2017, we studied the parasitism of D. siricidicola nematode and its effect on woodwasp populations and infestation of P. radiata in different locations within the Biobio region. Parasitism was assessed by dissecting adult females of S. noctilio obtained from infested P. radiata logs. The total population of S. noctilio was determined by the emergence of individuals from the same logs. The level of damage caused by the S. noctilio pest was determined by establishing plots in stands of P. radiata at an intensity of 1 plot every 5 ha-1. During the study period, parasitism of S. noctilio by the nematode D. siricidicola increased from 29.6% in 2012 to 93.1% in 2016, while pest population decreased 3.4% in the same time period. Infestation increased from 0.3 to 11,6% of trees between 2012 and 2015, but subsequently decreased to 5.9% by 2017. We confirmed establishment of the nematode in the region under study and its natural dispersion to non-inoculated areas. Finally, we determined that the effect of inoculation age (antiquity) on parasitism levels reached 90% after three years of inoculation."
https://openalex.org/W2901749801,"The genes, XRS2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and NBN in mammals, have little sequence identity at the amino acid level. Nevertheless, they are both found together with MRE11 and RAD50 in a highly conserved protein complex which functions in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Here, we have examined the evolutionary and functional relationship of these two genes by cross-complementation experiments. These experiments necessitated sequence correction for specific codon usage before they could be successfully conducted. We present evidence that despite extreme sequence divergence nibrin can, at least partially, replace Xrs2 in the cellular DNA damage response, and Xrs2 is able to promote nuclear localization of MRE11 in NBS cells. We discuss that the extreme sequence divergence reflects a unique adaptive pressure during evolution related to the specific eukaryotic role for both Xrs2 and nibrin in the subcellular localisation of the DNA repair complex. This, we suggest, is of particular relevance when cells are infected by viruses. The conflict hypothesis of co-evolution of DNA repair genes and DNA viruses may thus explain the very low sequence identity of these two homologous genes."
https://openalex.org/W2901904071,"Introduction A number of parenteral infections in third-world countries are caused by blood transfusions. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of and factors associated with infected blood obtained by the Honduran Red Cross through blood donations, to ensure the safety of the donated blood. Materials and methods This study used a cross-sectional analytical design based on the secondary analysis of data. Information on blood donors from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, between 2014 and 2016 were obtained from the database of the Honduran Red Cross. Data analysis was performed in two phases. The first phase described the variables, with the values presented as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. The second phase involved a statistical analysis using generalized linear models. Results The proportions of donors who tested positive for syphilis, core hepatitis, hepatitis B, human T-cell lymphotropic virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis C infections were 45% (n = 447), 35% (348), 11% (105), 10% (97), 6% (59), and 3% (24), respectively. The results of multivariate analysis demonstrated that the number of women positive for HIV infection was lower than that of men (p = 0.006). Older participants were more likely to be positive for core hepatitis (p = 0.029) and syphilis (p<0.001) infection but less likely to be positive for hepatitis B (p<0.001), hepatitis C (p = 0.027), human immunodeficiency virus (p<0.001), and human T-cell lymphotropic virus (p<0.001) infection compared to younger participants. Replacement donors had an increased likelihood of positivity for core hepatitis (p = 0.003) infections but a decreased likelihood of positivity for human T-cell lymphotropic virus infection (p = 0.001). Discussion The high prevalence of infectious diseases in Honduras warrants the need for monitoring donated blood to prevent infected blood from being provided for transfusions. Furthermore, education efforts through the creation of prevention programs are necessary to educate the Honduran population, especially younger individuals, about transfusion-transmissible infections."
