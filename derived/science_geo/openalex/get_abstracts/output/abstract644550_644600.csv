https://openalex.org/W2996385440,"This study estimates the effect of data sharing on the citations of academic articles, using journal policies as a natural experiment. We begin by examining 17 high-impact journals that have adopted the requirement that data from published articles be publicly posted. We match these 17 journals to 13 journals without policy changes and find that empirical articles published just before their change in editorial policy have citation rates with no statistically significant difference from those published shortly after the shift. We then ask whether this null result stems from poor compliance with data sharing policies, and use the data sharing policy changes as instrumental variables to examine more closely two leading journals in economics and political science with relatively strong enforcement of new data policies. We find that articles that make their data available receive 97 additional citations (estimate standard error of 34). We conclude that: a) authors who share data may be rewarded eventually with additional scholarly citations, and b) data-posting policies alone do not increase the impact of articles published in a journal unless those policies are enforced."
https://openalex.org/W2995716752,"Point-of-care testing (POCT) in low-resource settings requires tools that can operate independently of typical laboratory infrastructure. Due to its favorable signal-to-background ratio, a wide variety of biomedical tests utilize fluorescence as a readout. However, fluorescence techniques often require expensive or complex instrumentation and can be difficult to adapt for POCT. To address this issue, we developed a pocket-sized fluorescence detector costing less than $15 that is easy to manufacture and can operate in low-resource settings. It is built from standard electronic components, including an LED and a light dependent resistor, filter foils and 3D printed parts, and reliably reaches a lower limit of detection (LOD) of ≈ 6.8 nM fluorescein, which is sufficient to follow typical biochemical reactions used in POCT applications. All assays are conducted on filter paper, which allows for a flat detector architecture to improve signal collection. We validate the device by quantifying in vitro RNA transcription and also demonstrate sequence-specific detection of target RNAs with an LOD of 3.7 nM using a Cas13a-based fluorescence assay. Cas13a is an RNA-guided, RNA-targeting CRISPR effector with promiscuous RNase activity upon recognition of its RNA target. Cas13a sensing is highly specific and adaptable and in combination with our detector represents a promising approach for nucleic acid POCT. Furthermore, our open-source device may be used in educational settings, through providing low cost instrumentation for quantitative assays or as a platform to integrate hardware, software and biochemistry concepts in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2995739834,"Dandruff is a skin condition that affects the scalp of up to half the world’s population, it is characterised by an itchy, flaky scalp and is associated with colonisation of the skin by Malassezia spp. Management of this condition is typically via antifungal therapies, however the precise role of microbes in the aggravation of the condition are incompletely characterised. Here, a combination of 454 sequencing and qPCR techniques were used to compare the scalp microbiota of dandruff and non-dandruff affected Chinese subjects. Based on 454 sequencing of the scalp microbiome, the two most abundant bacterial genera found on the scalp surface were Cutibacterium (formerly Propionibacterium) and Staphylococcus, while Malassezia was the main fungal inhabitant. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of four scalp taxa (M. restricta, M. globosa, C. acnes and Staphylococcus spp.) believed to represent the bulk of the overall population was additionally carried out. Metataxonomic and qPCR analyses were performed on healthy and lesional buffer scrub samples to facilitate assessment of whether the scalp condition is associated with differential microbial communities on the sampled skin. Dandruff was associated with greater frequencies of M. restricta and Staphylococcus spp. compared with the healthy population (p<0.05). Analysis also revealed the presence of an unclassified fungal taxon that could represent a novel Malassezia species."
https://openalex.org/W2995511806,"Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is a Gram-positive bacterium isolated from the vaginal tract of approximately 25% of women. GBS colonization of the female reproductive tract is of particular concern during pregnancy as the bacteria can invade gestational tissues or be transmitted to the newborn during passage through the birth canal. Infection of the neonate can result in life-threatening pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. Thus, surveillance of GBS strains and corresponding virulence potential during colonization is warranted. Here we describe a panel of GBS isolates from the vaginal tracts of a cohort of pregnant women in Michigan, USA. We determined that capsular serotypes III and V were the most abundant across the strain panel, with only one isolate belonging to serotype IV. Further, 12.8% of strains belonged to the hyper-virulent serotype III, sequence type 17 (ST-17) and 15.4% expressed the serine rich repeat glycoprotein-encoding gene srr2. Functional assessment of the colonizing isolates revealed that almost all strains exhibited some level of β-hemolytic activity and that ST-17 strains, which express Srr2, exhibited increased bacterial adherence to vaginal epithelium. Finally, analysis of strain antibiotic susceptibility revealed the presence of antibiotic resistance to penicillin (15.4%), clindamycin (30.8%), erythromycin (43.6%), vancomycin (30.8%), and tetracycline (94.9%), which has significant implications for treatment options. Collectively, these data provide important information on vaginal GBS carriage isolate virulence potential and highlight the value of continued surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2995764042,"Since in most mapping models geometric mean of different criteria are used to determine the desertification intensity, one of the most important issues in desertification studies is understanding the similar areas, which require similar management after determining the desertification intensity map. Two similar classes of desertification intensity may require different management due to differences in the criteria that affect its desertification severity. Therefore, after determining the geomorphological facies as the working units in Sistan plain, we used hierarchical cluster analysis to identify the homogeneous environmental management units (HEMUs) based on indices of MEDALUS model. According to the MEDALUS model, the studied area was divided into two categories namely medium and high desertification classes. Working units (geomorphological facies) are classified into five clusters according to HEMUs analysis based on climate, soil, vegetation, and wind erosion criteria. The first cluster (C11) include six facies with moderate and severe desertification; in all of these units the main effective factor was wind erosion, so they need the same management decisions controlling wind erosion. Two working units (1 and 4) with the same desertification severity were placed in two different clusters due to the main factors affecting each other. The results of the Mann-Whitney test showed that the value of the test statistics was 79. Also, the value of Asymp.Sig was obtained to be 0.018, which is less than 0.025 (two-tailed test), and it can be concluded that the classification of work units in the two models, clustering and desertification, is not equal (P<0.05). So It seems that using cluster analysis to identify the same units, which need the same management decision after preparing the desertification intensity, is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2996057874,"Classical methods for estimating the abundance of fish populations are often both expensive, time-consuming and destructive. Analyses of the environmental DNA (eDNA) present in water samples could alleviate such constraints. Here, we developed protocols to detect and quantify brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) populations by applying the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method to eDNA molecules extracted from water samples collected in 28 Swedish mountain lakes. Overall, contemporary fish CPUE (catch per unit effort) estimates from standardized survey gill nettings were not correlated to eDNA concentrations for either of the species. In addition, the measured environmental variables (e.g. dissolved organic carbon concentrations, temperature, and pH) appear to not influence water eDNA concentrations of the studied fish species. Detection probabilities via eDNA analysis showed moderate success (less than 70% for both species) while the presence of eDNA from Arctic char (in six lakes) and brown trout (in one lake) was also indicated in lakes where the species were not detected with the gillnetting method. Such findings highlight the limits of one or both methods to reliably detect fish species presence in natural systems. Additional analysis showed that the filtration of water samples through 1.2 μm glass fiber filters and 0.45 μm mixed cellulose ester filters was more efficient in recovering DNA than using 0.22 μm enclosed polyethersulfone filters, probably due to differential efficiencies of DNA extraction. Altogether, this work showed the potentials and limits of the approach for the detection and the quantification of fish abundance in natural systems while providing new insights in the application of the ddPCR method applied to environmental DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2996105902,"Primary cell isolation from the central nervous system (CNS) has allowed fundamental understanding of blood-brain barrier (BBB) properties. However, poorly described isolation techniques or suboptimal cellular purity has been a weak point of some published scientific articles. Here, we describe in detail how to isolate and enrich, using a common approach, endothelial cells (ECs) from adult mouse brains, as well as pericytes (PCs) and astrocytes (ACs) from newborn mouse brains. Our approach allowed the isolation of these three brain cell types with purities of around 90%. Furthermore, using our protocols, around 3 times more PCs and 2 times more ACs could be grown in culture, as compared to previously published protocols. The cells were identified and characterized using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The ability of ECs to form a tight monolayer was assessed for passages 0 to 3. The expression of claudin-5, occludin, zonula occludens-1, P-glycoprotein-1 and breast cancer resistance protein by ECs, as well as the ability of the cells to respond to cytokine stimuli (TNF-α, IFN-γ) was also investigated by q-PCR. The transcellular permeability of ECs was evaluated in the presence of pericytes or astrocytes in a Transwell® model by measuring the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), dextran-FITC and sodium fluorescein permeability. Overall, ECs at passages 0 and 1 featured the best properties valued in a BBB model. Furthermore, pericytes did not increase tightness of EC monolayers, whereas astrocytes did regardless of their seeding location. Finally, ECs resuspended in fetal bovine serum (FBS) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) could be cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen without affecting their phenotype nor their capacity to form a tight monolayer, thus allowing these primary cells to be used for various longitudinal in vitro studies of the blood-brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2994718159,"Scat DNA metabarcoding is increasingly being used to track the feeding ecology of elusive wildlife species. This approach has greatly increased the resolution and detection success of prey items contained in scats when compared with other classical methods. However, there have been few studies that have systematically tested the applicability and reliability of this approach to study the diet of large felids species in the wild. Here we assessed the effectiveness of this approach in the cheetah Acinonyx jubatus. We tested how scat degradation, meal size, prey species consumed and feeding day (the day a particular prey was consumed) influenced prey DNA detection success in captive cheetahs. We demonstrated that it is possible to obtain diet information from 60-day old scats using genetic approaches, but the efficiency decreased over time. Probability of species-identification was highest for food items consumed one day prior to scat collection and the probability of being able to identify the species consumed increased with the proportion of the prey consumed. Detection success varied among prey species but not by individual cheetah. Identification of prey species using DNA detection methods from a single consumption event worked for samples collected between 8 and 72 hours post-feeding. Our approach confirms the utility of genetic approaches to identify prey species in scats and highlight the need to account for the systematic bias in results to control for possible scat degradation, feeding day, meal size and prey species consumed especially in the wild-collected scats."

https://openalex.org/W2996360292,"Background Older women perform consistently poorer on physical performance tests compared to men. Risk groups for this “female disadvantage” in physical performance and it’s development over successive birth cohorts are unknown. This is important information for preventive strategies aimed to enhance healthy aging in all older women. This study aims to longitudinal investigate whether there are risk groups for a more apparent female disadvantage and study its trend over successive birth cohorts. Methods Data of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) were used. All participants were aged 55–65 years at baseline. Longitudinal data of two birth cohorts with baseline measurements in 1992/1993 (n = 966, 24 year follow-up) and 2002/2003 (n = 1002, 12 year follow-up) were included. Follow-up measurements were repeated every three/four years. Cross-sectional data of two additional cohorts were included to compare ethnic groups: a Dutch cohort (2012/2013, n = 1023) and a Migration cohort (2013/2014, n = 478) consisting of migrants with a Turkish/Moroccan ethnicity. Results Mixed model analysis showed that women aged 55 years and older had a lower age- and height-adjusted gait speed (-0.03 m/s; -0.063–0.001), chair stand speed (-0.05 stand/s; -0.071–-0.033), handgrip strength (-14,8 kg; -15.69–-13.84) and balance (OR = 0.71; 0.547–0.916) compared to men. The sex difference in handgrip strength diminished with increasing age, but remained stable for gait speed, chair stand speed and balance. In general, results were consistent across different, educational levels and Turkish/Moroccan ethnic groups and birth cohorts. Conclusions There is a consistent “female disadvantage” in physical performance among older adults, which remains stable with increasing age (except for handgrip strength) and is consistent across different educational levels, ethnic groups and successive birth cohorts. So, no specific risk groups for the female disadvantage in physical performance were identified. Preventive strategies aimed to enhance healthy aging in older women are needed and should target all older women."
https://openalex.org/W2995945070,"In this paper, a simple yet interpretable, probabilistic model is proposed for the prediction of reported case counts of infectious diseases. A spatio-temporal kernel is derived from training data to capture the typical interaction effects of reported infections across time and space, which provides insight into the dynamics of the spread of infectious diseases. Testing the model on a one-week-ahead prediction task for campylobacteriosis and rotavirus infections across Germany, as well as Lyme borreliosis across the federal state of Bavaria, shows that the proposed model performs on-par with the state-of-the-art hhh4 model. However, it provides a full posterior distribution over parameters in addition to model predictions, which aides in the assessment of the model. The employed Bayesian Monte Carlo regression framework is easily extensible and allows for incorporating prior domain knowledge, which makes it suitable for use on limited, yet complex datasets as often encountered in epidemiology."
https://openalex.org/W2995839195,"The order Piroplasmida encompasses two main families: Babesiidae and Theileriidae, containing tick-borne pathogens of veterinary and medical importance worldwide. While only three genera (Babesia, Cytauxzoon and Theileria) comprising piroplasm parasites are currently recognised, phylogenetic studies at the 18S rRNA (18S) gene suggest that these organisms represent at least ten lineages, one of which comprises the relatively unique and highly diverse Theileria spp. from Australian marsupials and ticks. As an alternative to analysing 18S sequences alone, sequencing of mitochondrial genes has proven to be useful for the elucidation of evolutionary relationships amongst some groups of piroplasms. This research aimed to characterise piroplasms from Australian native mammals and ticks using multiple genetic markers (18S, cytochrome c, oxidase subunit III (cox3) and cytochrome B (cytB)) and microscopy. For this, nearly complete piroplasm-18S sequences were obtained from 32 animals belonging to six marsupial species: eastern bettong (Bettongia gaimardi), eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus), eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor), quokka (Setonix brachyurus) and Gilbert's potoroo (Potorous gilbertii). The organisms detected represented eight novel Theileria genotypes, which formed five sub-clades within the main marsupial clade containing previously reported Australian marsupial and tick-derived Theileria spp. A selection of both novel and previously described Australian piroplasms at the 18S were also successfully characterised, for the first time, at the cox3 and cytB loci, and corroborated the position of Australian native theilerias in a separate, well-supported clade. Analyses of the cox3 and cytB genes also aided in the taxonomic resolution within the clade of Australian Piroplasmida. Importantly, microscopy and molecular analysis at multiple loci led to the discovery of a unique piroplasm species that clustered with the Australian marsupial theilerias, for which we propose the name Theileria lupei n. sp."
https://openalex.org/W2995891399,"Background People living with a Serious Mental Illness (SMI) die earlier than the general population due to preventable medical conditions. Latinos living with SMI are a particularly vulnerable population with higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions. Stigma has been identified as a factor that fosters health inequities for Latinos/as with SMI, particularly Puerto Ricans. Although personal and social consequences of stigmatization have been well documented, research regarding the role of cultural factors on healthcare interactions is scarce. Furthermore, little research has focused on addressing stigma from the perspective of healthcare professionals. Methods We investigated this process through a qualitative design using semi-structured individual interviews with 11 healthcare professionals (8 physicians and 3 nurses) in Puerto Rico. We conducted a thematic analysis to analyze the data. Results Following a thematic analysis, we found three main themes and nine sub-themes related to the stigmatization process. Some participants reported perceptions of dangerousness and uneasiness, social distance and inadequate care. Participants also emphasized a lack of medical training regarding SMI within the Puerto Rican context. Conclusions These findings support the need to develop culturally appropriate public health interventions targeting healthcare professionals in order to address stigma and eliminate health disparities among Latinos/as with SMI."
https://openalex.org/W2994880071,"The processing and characterization of hybrid PMMA resin composites with nano-zirconia (ZrO2) and electrospun polystyrene (PS) polymer fibers were presented in this study. Reinforcement was selected with the intention to tune the physical and mechanical properties of the hybrid composite. Surface modification of inorganic particles was performed in order to improve the adhesion of reinforcement to the matrix. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provided successful modification of zirconia nanoparticles with 3-Methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MEMO) and bonding improvement between incompatible inorganic nanoparticles and PMMA matrix. Considerable deagglomeration of nanoparticles in the matrix occurred after the modification has been revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Microhardness increased with the concentration of modified nanoparticles, while the fibers were the modifier that lowers hardness and promotes toughness of hybrid composites. Impact test displayed increased absorbed energy after the PS electrospun fibers had been embedded. The optimized composition of the hybrid was determined and a good balance of thermal and mechanical properties was achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2996489976,"Melanism in the cat family has been associated with functions including camouflage, thermoregulation and parasite resistance. Here we investigate a new hypothesis proposing that the evolution of melanism in cats has additionally been influenced by communication functions of body markings. To evaluate this hypothesis, we assembled a species-level data set of morphological (body marks: white marks on the backs of ears) and ecological (circadian activity: arrhythmic/nocturnal, and environmental preference: open/closed) characteristics that could be associated with communication via body markings, and combined these data with a dated molecular phylogeny. Next, we tested the association between melanism and communication, first by relating species’ body marks with their ecological conditions, using a Bayesian implementation of the threshold model. Second, to explore the evolution of characteristics potentially influencing melanism in cat species, we modeled their evolution relative to melanism using models of coordinated vs. independent character changes. Our results suggest that white marks are associated with intraspecific communication between individuals that have non-melanistic phenotypes, as well as towards melanistic individuals (without white marks). The absence of white marks in a melanistic individual tends to be a limiting condition for intraspecific visual communication at night, resulting in an evolutionary dilemma for these species, i.e. to be almost invisible at night, but not to communicate visually. The comparative analysis of several evolutionary models indicated more support for the evolution of melanism being coordinated with the evolution of arrhythmic activity and white marks on the backs of ears."
https://openalex.org/W2996582062,"Shift work and jet lag, characterized by circadian misalignment, can disrupt several physiological activities, but whether they affect the rhythm of glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity remain unclear. In the present study, female C57BL/6J mice were maintained for four weeks under the condition of 8-hour phase advance and delay every 3–4 days to mimic shift work. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (IPITT) were performed repeatedly at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0, ZT6, ZT12, and ZT18. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) test was performed at ZT6. We found that the average level of daily glucose tolerance did not decrease but the phase of glucose tolerance advanced by 2.27 hours and the amplitude attenuated by 20.4% in shift work mice. At ZT6, IPITT showed blood glucose at 30 min after insulin injection decreased faster in shift work mice (−3.50±0.74mmol/L, −61.58±7.89%) than that in control mice (−2.11±1.10mmol/L, −33.72±17.24%), but IPGTT and GSIS test showed no significant difference between the two groups. Food intake monitor showed that the feeding time of shift work mice continued to advance. Restricting feed to a fixed 12-hour period alleviated the increase of insulin sensitivity induced by shift-work. We also observed that an increase of blood glucose and liver glycogen at ZT0, as well as a phase advance of liver clock genes and some glucose metabolism-related genes such as forkhead box O1 (Foxo1) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (Pparα) in shift work mice. Our results showed that light change-simulated shift work altered insulin sensitivity during the light phase and shifted glucose tolerance rhythms in female mice, suggesting a causal association between long-term shift work and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2995394879,"The bacterial growth environment within cystic fibrosis (CF) sputum is complex, dynamic, and shaped by both host and microbial processes. Characterization of the chemical parameters within sputum that stimulate the in vivo growth of airway pathogens (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and their associated virulence factors may lead to improved CF treatment strategies. Motivated by conflicting reports of the prevalence and abundance of P. aeruginosa-derived metabolites known as phenazines within CF airway secretions, we sought to quantify these metabolites in sputum using quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In contrast to our previous work, all phenazines tested (pyocyanin (PYO), phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA), phenazine-1-carboxamide, and 1-hydroxyphenazine) were below detection limits of the instrument (0.1 μM). Instead, we identified a late-eluting compound that shared retention time and absorbance characteristics with PCA, yet generated mass spectra and a fragmentation pattern consistent with ferriprotoporphyrin IX, otherwise known as heme B. These data suggested that UV-vis chromatographic peaks previously attributed to PCA and PYO in sputum were mis-assigned. Indeed, retrospective analysis of raw data from our prior study found that the heme B peak closely matched the peaks assigned to PCA, indicating that the previous study likely uncovered a positive correlation between pulmonary function (percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or ppFEV1) and heme B, not PCA or any other phenazine. To independently test this observation, we performed a new tandem mass-spectrometry analysis of 71 additional samples provided by the Mountain West CF Consortium Sputum Biomarker study and revealed a positive correlation (ρ = −0.47, p<0.001) between sputum heme concentrations and ppFEV1. Given that hemoptysis is strongly associated with airway inflammation, pulmonary exacerbations and impaired lung function, these new data suggest that heme B may be a useful biomarker of CF pathophysiology."

Hackers often use fraudulent emails to simply ask people for their password to breach into organizations. This technique, called phishing, is a major threat for many organizations. A typical prevention measure is to inform employees but is there a better way to reduce phishing risks? Experience and feedback have often been claimed to be effective in helping people make better decisions. In a large field experiment involving more than 10,000 employees of a Dutch ministry, we tested the effect of information provision, simulated experience, and their combination to reduce the risks of falling into a phishing attack. Both approaches substantially reduced the proportion of employees giving away their password. Combining both interventions did not have a larger impact."
https://openalex.org/W2996035147,"Background Confounding by disease severity is an issue in pharmacoepidemiology studies of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), due to channeling of sicker patients to certain therapies. To address the issue of limited clinical data for confounder adjustment, a patient-level prediction model to differentiate between patients prescribed and not prescribed advanced therapies was developed as a surrogate for disease severity, using all available data from a US claims database. Methods Data from adult RA patients were used to build regularized logistic regression models to predict current and future disease severity using a biologic or tofacitinib prescription claim as a surrogate for moderate-to-severe disease. Model discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver (AUC) operating characteristic curve, tested and trained in Optum Clinformatics® Extended DataMart (Optum) and additionally validated in three external IBM MarketScan® databases. The model was further validated in the Optum database across a range of patient cohorts. Results In the Optum database (n = 68,608), the AUC for discriminating RA patients with a prescription claim for a biologic or tofacitinib versus those without in the 90 days following index diagnosis was 0.80. Model AUCs were 0.77 in IBM CCAE (n = 75,579) and IBM MDCD (n = 7,537) and 0.75 in IBM MDCR (n = 36,090). There was little change in the prediction model assessing discrimination 730 days following index diagnosis (prediction model AUC in Optum was 0.79). Conclusions A prediction model demonstrated good discrimination across multiple claims databases to identify RA patients with a prescription claim for advanced therapies during different time-at-risk periods as proxy for current and future moderate-to-severe disease. This work provides a robust model-derived risk score that can be used as a potential covariate and proxy measure to adjust for confounding by severity in multivariable models in the RA population. An R package to develop the prediction model and risk score are available in an open source platform for researchers."
https://openalex.org/W2994957157,"It is well-established that the kidney collecting duct (CD) plays a central role in regulation of systemic water homeostasis. Aquaporin 2 (AQP2)-dependent water reabsorption in the CD critically depends on the arginine vasopressin (AVP) antidiuretic input and the presence of a favorable osmotic gradient at the apical plasma membrane with tubular lumen being hypotonic compared to the cytosol. This osmotic difference creates a mechanical force leading to an increase in [Ca2+]i in CD cells. The significance of the osmosensitive [Ca2+]i signaling for renal water transport and urinary concentration remain unknown. To examine molecular mechanism and physiological relevance of osmosensitivity in the CD, we implemented simultaneous direct measurements of [Ca2+]i dynamics and the rate of cell swelling as a readout of the AQP2-dependent water reabsorption in freshly isolated split-opened CDs of wild type and genetically manipulated animals and combined this with immunofluorescent detection of AVP-induced AQP2 trafficking and assessment of systemic water balance. We identified the critical role of the Ca2+-permeable TRPC3 channel in osmosensitivity and water permeability in the CD. We further demonstrated that TRPC3 -/- mice exhibit impaired urinary concentration, larger urinary volume and a greater weight loss in response to water deprivation despite increased AVP levels and AQP2 abundance. TRPC3 deletion interfered with AQP2 translocation to the plasma membrane in response to water deprivation. In summary, we provide compelling multicomponent evidence in support of a critical contribution of TRPC3 in the CD for osmosensitivity and renal water handling."
https://openalex.org/W2996214070,"It is now well established that for tumour growth and survival, tumour vasculature is an important element. Studies have demonstrated that ultrasound-stimulated microbubble (USMB) treatment causes extensive endothelial cell death leading to tumour vascular disruption. The subsequent rapid vascular collapse translates to overall increases in tumour response to various therapies. In this study, we explored USMB involvement in the enhancement of hyperthermia (HT) treatment effects. Human prostate tumour (PC3) xenografts were grown in mice and were treated with USMB, HT, or with a combination of the two treatments. Treatment parameters consisted of ultrasound pressures of 0 to 740 kPa, the use of perfluorocarbon-filled microbubbles administered intravenously, and an HT temperature of 43°C delivered for various times (0-50 minutes). Single and multiple repeated treatments were evaluated. Tumour response was monitored 24 hours after treatments and tumour growth was monitored for up to over 30 days for a single treatment and 4 weeks for multiple treatments. Tumours exposed to USMB combined with HT exhibited enhanced cell death (p<0.05) and decreased vasculature (p<0.05) compared to untreated tumours or those treated with either USMB alone or HT alone within 24 hours. Deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) staining were used to assess cell death and vascular content, respectively. Further, tumours receiving a single combined USMB and HT treatment exhibited decreased tumour volumes (p<0.05) compared to those receiving either treatment alone when monitored over the duration of 30 days. Additionally, tumour response monitored weekly up to 4 weeks demonstrated a reduced vascular index and tumour volume, increased fibrosis and lesser number of proliferating cells with combined treatment of USMB and HT. Thus in this study, we characterize a novel therapeutic approach that combines USMB with HT to enhance treatment responses in a prostate cancer xenograft model in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2996696960,"Brettanomyces bruxellensis is the main wine spoiler yeast all over the world, yet the structure of the populations associated with winemaking remains elusive. In this work, we considered 1411 wine isolates from 21 countries that were genotyped using twelve microsatellite markers. We confirmed that B. bruxellensis isolates from wine environments show high genetic diversity, with 58 and 42% of putative triploid and diploid individuals respectively distributed in 5 main genetic groups. The distribution in the genetic groups varied greatly depending on the country and/or the wine-producing region. However, the two possible triploid wine groups showing sulfite resistance/tolerance were identified in almost all regions/countries. Genetically identical isolates were also identified. The analysis of these clone groups revealed that a given genotype could be isolated repeatedly in the same winery over decades, demonstrating unsuspected persistence ability. Besides cellar residency, a great geographic dispersal was also evidenced, with some genotypes isolated in wines from different continents. Finally, the study of old isolates and/or isolates from old vintages revealed that only the diploid groups were identified prior 1990 vintages. The putative triploid groups were identified in subsequent vintages, and their proportion has increased steadily these last decades, suggesting adaptation to winemaking practices such as sulfite use. A possible evolutionary scenario explaining these results is discussed."

This study aims to evaluate the association of cord blood DNA methylation patterns with anthropometric measures and cord blood leptin, a biomarker of neonatal adiposity.A cross-sectional study was performed on a multiethnic cohort of 114 full term neonates born to mothers without gestational diabetes at a university hospital. Cord blood was assayed for leptin and for epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles via the Illumina 450K platform. Neonatal body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyze associations between individual CpG sites as well as differentially methylated regions in cord blood DNA with measures of newborn adiposity including anthropometrics (birth weight, fat mass and percent body fat) and cord blood leptin. False discovery rate was estimated to account for multiple comparisons.247 CpG sites as well as 18 differentially methylated gene regions were associated with cord blood leptin but no epigenetic changes were associated with birth weight, fat mass or percent body fat. Genes of interest identified in this study are DNAJA4, TFR2, SMAD3, PLAG1, FGF1, and HNF4A.Epigenetic changes in cord blood DNA are associated with cord blood leptin levels, a measure of neonatal adiposity."
https://openalex.org/W2996514756,"Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in non-infected orthopedic surgery is evident, in contrast to prophylaxis during surgery for infection. Epidemiological data are lacking for this particular situation.It is a single-center cohort on iterative surgical site infections (SSIs) in infected orthopedic patients. We included 2480 first episodes of orthopedic infections (median age 56 years and 833 immune-suppressed): implant-related infections (n = 648), osteoarticular infections (1153), and 1327 soft tissue infections. The median number of debridement was 1 (range, 1-15 interventions). Overall, 1617 infections (65%) were debrided once compared to 862 cases that were operated multiple times (35%). Upon iterative intraoperative tissue sampling, we detected pathogens in 507 cases (507/862; 59%), of which 241 (242/507; 48%) corresponded to the initial species at the first debridement. We witnessed 265 new SSIs (11% of the cohort) that were resistant to current antibiotic therapy in 174 cases (7% of the cohort). In multivariate analysis, iterative surgical debridements that were performed under current antibiotic administration were associated with new SSIs (odds ratio 1.6, 95%CI 1.2-2.2); mostly occurring after the 2nd debridement. However, we failed to define an ideal hypothetic prophylaxis during antibiotic therapy to prevent further SSIs.Selection of new pathogens resistant to ongoing antibiotic therapy occurs frequently during iterative debridement in orthopedic infections, especially after the 2nd debridement. The new pathogens are however unpredictable. The prevention, if feasible, probably relies on surgical performance and wise indications for re-debridement instead of new maximal prophylactic antibiotic coverage in addition to current therapeutic regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2996535017,"Current research revealed distinct changes in ecosystem functions, and thus in ecosystem stability and resilience, caused by changes in community structure and diversity loss. Benthic species play an important role in benthic-pelagic coupling, such as through the remineralization of deposited organic material, and changes to benthic community structure and diversity have associated with changes in ecosystem functioning, ecosystem stability and resilience. However, the long-term variability of traits and functions in benthic communities is largely unknown. By using abundance and bioturbation potential of macrofauna samples, taken along a transect from the German Bight towards the Dogger Bank in May 1990 and annually from 1995 to 2017, we analysed the taxonomic and trait-based macrofauna long-term community variability and diversity. Taxonomic and trait-based diversity remained stable over time, while three different regimes were found, characterised by changes in taxonomic and trait-based community structure. Min/max autocorrelation factor analysis revealed the climatic variables sea surface temperature (SST) and North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI), nitrite, and epibenthic abundance as most important environmental drivers for taxonomic and trait-based community changes."
https://openalex.org/W2996440257,"Rafflesia possesses unique biological features and known primarily for producing the world’s largest and existing as a single flower. However, to date, little is known about key regulators participating in Rafflesia flower development. In order to further understand the molecular mechanism that regulates Rafflesia cantleyi flower development, RNA-seq data from three developmental stages of floral bud, representing the floral organ primordia initiation, floral organ differentiation, and floral bud outgrowth, were analysed. A total of 89,890 transcripts were assembled of which up to 35% could be annotated based on homology search. Advanced transcriptome analysis using K-mean clustering on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was able to identify 12 expression clusters that reflect major trends and key transitional states, which correlate to specific developmental stages. Through this, comparative gene expression analysis of different floral bud stages identified various transcription factors related to flower development. The members of WRKY, NAC, bHLH, and MYB families are the most represented among the DEGs, suggesting their important function in flower development. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis also revealed DEGs that are involved in various phytohormone signal transduction events such as auxin and auxin transport, cytokinin and gibberellin biosynthesis. Results of this study imply that transcription factors and phytohormone signalling pathways play major role in Rafflesia floral bud development. This study provides an invaluable resource for molecular studies of the flower development process in Rafflesia and other plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2995310665,"Since 2009, syphilis has been increasing in New York State (NYS) excluding New York City (NYC) among men with a history of male-to-male sexual contact (MSM). Because MSM make up a disproportionate number of new HIV infections, this study aims to: 1) establish yearly rates of early syphilis diagnosis, 2) assess factors associated with early syphilis diagnosis, and 3) describe missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis of syphilis among MSM living with diagnosed HIV(MSMLWDH) in NYS, excluding NYC. A cohort of adult MSMLWDH alive in 2013 were followed through 2016 to identify individuals with at least one early syphilis diagnosis between July 2014 and December 2016. Early syphilis diagnosis rates were calculated for 2015 and 2016. Crude relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to determine associations between available covariates and both syphilis diagnosis and missed opportunities. Missed opportunities were defined as reports of an HIV-related laboratory test within a given window corresponding to syphilis staging where syphilis testing was not performed at the same time. Of 7,512 MSMLWDH, 50.0% were non-Hispanic white, 85.4% aged ≥35, and 320(4.3%) had an early syphilis diagnosis. Yearly rates were: 1,838/100,000, and 1,681/100,000 in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Persons who were non-Hispanic black, living with diagnosed HIV for less than three years, aged <45, and were always virally suppressed or always in HIV care were significantly more likely to have a syphilis diagnosis. Over half of individuals had evidence of a missed opportunity for earlier syphilis diagnosis. Syphilis stage at diagnosis, older age, and syphilis diagnosis not concurrent with an HIV-related laboratory test were associated with a higher likelihood of having a missed opportunity. This study supports high interrelatedness of the syphilis and HIV epidemics among MSM. Since syphilis can impact HIV viral load suppression status, efforts to end the HIV epidemic need to be coupled with syphilis elimination efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2995518353,"Dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPAPs) are cysteine proteases that cleave dipeptides from the N-terminus of protein substrates and have been shown to play important roles in many pathologies including parasitic diseases such as malaria, toxoplasmosis and Chagas’s disease. Inhibitors of the mammalian homologue cathepsin C have been used in clinical trials as potential drugs to treat chronic inflammatory disorders, thus proving that these enzymes are druggable. In Plasmodium species, DPAPs play important functions at different stages of parasite development, thus making them potential antimalarial targets. Most DPAP inhibitors developed to date are peptide-based or peptidomimetic competitive inhibitors. Here, we used a high throughput screening approach to identify novel inhibitor scaffolds that block the activity of Plasmodium falciparum DPAP1. Most of the hits identified in this screen also inhibit Plasmodium falciparum DPAP3, cathepsin C, and to a lesser extent other malarial clan CA proteases, indicating that these might be general DPAP inhibitors. Interestingly, our mechanism of inhibition studies indicate that most hits are allosteric inhibitors, which opens a completely new strategy to inhibit these enzymes, study their biological function, and potentially develop new inhibitors as starting points for drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2995570324,"Evidence suggests that sex influences the effect of diet on the gut bacterial composition, yet, no studies have been performed assessing dietary fatty acid composition (i.e., fat quality) in this context. This study examined the effect of dietary fat quality on colonic bacterial composition in an aged, genetically-diverse mouse population. CD-1 mice were fed isoenergetic diets consisting of (1) control fat (CO; “Western-style” fat blend), (2) CO supplemented with 30% fish oil, (3) CO supplemented with 30% dairy fat, or (4) CO supplemented with 30% echium oil. Fecal samples were collected at mid-life and aged (reproductively senescent) time points. Overall, the abundance of Bacteroidetes was greater in mice fed echium oil compared to mice fed the control fat. Examination of colonic bacterial relative abundance also revealed sex differences, with 73 bacterial taxa being differentially expressed in males and females. Notably, results showed a strong interactive effect among the diet, sex, and age of mice which influenced colonic bacterial relative abundance and alpha diversity. In males, supplementation of the diet with dairy fat or echium oil caused the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Bacteroides to change with age. Additionally, supplementation of the diet with fish oil induced sex-dependent changes in the alpha diversity of aged mice compared to mid-life. This work supports that sex is a critical factor in colonic bacterial composition of an aged, genetically-heterogenous population. Moreover, this study establishes that the effectiveness of dietary interventions for health maintenance and disease prevention via direct or indirect manipulation of the gut microbiota is likely dependent on an individual’s sex, age, and genetic background."
https://openalex.org/W2995590562,"Introduction Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients are at increased risk for severe infections. This study examined the associations of common oral infections with survival and infectious complications in HSCT recipients. Materials and methods All autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients transplanted in the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland, between 2008 and 2016 and referred to oral infection control pre-HSCT were included in this retrospective case-control study. All patients had a clinical and a panoramic radiological dental examination taken immediately prior to HSCT. Presence of acute or chronic oral foci of infections, decayed, missing or filled tooth index (DMFT) and radiological attachment loss (RAL) were examined. Survival and infections of the subjects were followed up for 6 months post-HSCT. Results Altogether 341 allogeneic and 125 autologous HSCT recipients were included in the study. Within 6 months post-HSCT, 47 (14%) of the allogeneic and 4 (3%) of the autologous recipients died. Oral foci of infections (acute or chronic), DMFT or periodontitis pre-HSCT were not associated with survival 6 months post-HSCT. Oral foci of infections were also not associated with hospital treated infectious diseases or blood culture positive bacteremia during the 6 month follow-up period. Untreated oral foci of infections were not associated with survival or severe infectious complications within 6 months post-HSCT. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that radical dental interventions to chronic oral infections could be postponed until post-HSCT."
https://openalex.org/W2994931134,"Background To understand the underlying mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction in cancer, we examined cardiac function, protein synthesis, mitochondrial function and gene expression in a model of heart failure in mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC1) cells. Experimental design Seven week-old C57BL/J6 male and female mice were injected with LLC1 cells or vehicle. Cardiac ejection fraction, ventricular wall and septal thickness were reduced in male, but not female, tumor-bearing mice compared to vehicle-injected control mice. Cardiac protein synthesis was reduced in tumor-bearing male mice compared to control mice (p = 0.025). Aspect ratio and form factor of cardiac mitochondria from the tumor-bearing mice were increased compared control mice (p = 0.042 and p = 0.0032, respectively) indicating a more fused mitochondrial network in the hearts of tumor-bearing mice. In cultured cardiomyocytes maximal oxygen consumption and mitochondrial reserve capacity were reduced in cells exposed to tumor cell-conditioned medium compared to non-conditioned medium (p = 0.0059, p = 0.0010). Whole transcriptome sequencing of cardiac ventricular muscle from tumor-bearing vs. control mice showed altered expression of 1648 RNA transcripts with a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. Of these, 54 RNA transcripts were reduced ≤ 0.5 fold, and 3 RNA transcripts were increased by ≥1.5-fold in tumor-bearing mouse heart compared to control. Notably, the expression of mRNAs for apelin (Apln), the apelin receptor (Aplnr), the N-myc proto-oncogene, early growth protein (Egr1), and the transcription factor Sox9 were reduced by >50%, whereas the mRNA for growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, beta (Gadd45b) is increased >2-fold, in ventricular tissue from tumor-bearing mice compared to control mice. Conclusions Lung tumor cells induce heart failure in male mice in association with reduced protein synthesis, mitochondrial function, and the expression of the mRNAs for inotropic and growth factors. These data provide new mechanistic insights into cancer-associated heart failure that may help unlock treatment options for this condition."
https://openalex.org/W2995684426,"Rules regulate behavior, but in competitive contexts they also create incentives for rule-breaking because enforcement is imperfect. Sports is a prime example of this, and one that lends itself well to investigation because strategic rule-breaking is often measurable. Professional soccer is a highly competitive team sport with economic rewards for winning given to teams and players. It has a set of rules to ensure fair play, but the enforcement is incomplete, and hence can lead to strategic behavior. Using newly available data, we examine strategic time-wasting, a behavior that help teams win games, or tie games against superior opponents, but is contrary to the objective of game play as entertainment for the spectators. We demonstrate that strategic time-wasting is widespread and is done through delayed restart of the game after goalie capture of the ball, goal kick, throw-in, free kick, corner kick, and substitution. The strategic time-wasting has substantial magnitude, and models of the value per minute predict time-wasting well. Because this time-wasting is a result of incentives created by not stopping the game clock, we predict that a change to rules with stopped game clock when the play is stopped would make game play more time efficient."
https://openalex.org/W2995576304,"The issue of how to alleviate the negative effects imposed by water stress is an interesting problem. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) colonize the rhizosphere of plants and are known to promote the growth of crops. However, there are few studies characterizing the physiological response of plants to drought stress after PGPR inoculation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of different PGPRs in arid environments and then investigated the effects of PGPR inoculation under drought stress on the physiological characteristics and growth of North China red elder (Sambucus williamsii) nursery container seedlings. The viable count of different PGPRs under drought stress varies widely, and the drought tolerance of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus X128 was significantly higher than that of other PGPRs. In comparison with non-inoculation, inoculation with X128 in an arid environment significantly increased stomatal conductance and mitigated the inhibition of net photosynthetic rate caused by drought stress; this mitigating effect of inoculation is enhanced as the level of drought stress increases. Relative to non-inoculated seedlings, cytokinin levels in the leaves increased by 91.17% under severe drought stress conditions in inoculated seedlings. However, X128 inoculation decreased this deficit to only 44.54%. Compared with non-inoculated seedlings, the relative water content of inoculated seedlings under severe drought stress increased by 15.06%, however the relative conductivity decreased by 12.48%. Consequently, X128 could increase dry matter accumulation of S. williamsii regardless of watering status, indicative of the greater benefits of PGPR on shoot growth than root. Therefore, inoculation of A. calcoaceticus X128 under drought conditions play a significant role for alleviating the negative effects imposed by water stress and promoting plant growth."
https://openalex.org/W2995862462,"Poor visual conditions in tunnels can easily cause traffic accidents, and it is difficult for emergency services to reach these areas. As an economical and effective visual guiding device, delineators have attracted wide attention. Based on the actual alignment of the Qinling Mountain No.1, No.2 and No.3 tunnels of the G5 Expressway in Xi'an City (Shaanxi Province, China), this paper designs a simulation experiment. Through a simulator study and a questionnaire survey, this paper discusses how delineators affect drivers' visual characteristics (including fixation area and pupil size) in different settings and with different road alignments. Twenty-five subjects participated in this research. The results show that setting delineators in tunnels can continuously guide drivers' vision and attract their attention to focus on the pavement. Compared with setting only pavement delineators, setting wall delineators and pavement delineators together can provide better guiding effects and ensure driving safety in both straight and curved sections. In addition, when driving in tunnels equipped with delineators, especially tunnels with both wall delineators and pavement delineators, the participants exhibited a smaller pupil diameter and lower pupil diameter change rate. In terms of the relationship between pupil size and road alignment, the results indicated that regardless of what type of delineator was used, the drivers exhibited the smallest pupil size and lowest pupil change rate when driving on the straight section compared with the curved sections."
https://openalex.org/W2995930510,"Participants’ eye movements (EMs) and EEG signal were simultaneously recorded to examine foveal and parafoveal processing during sentence reading. All the words in the sentence were manipulated for inter-word spacing (intact spaces vs. spaces replaced by a random letter) and parafoveal preview (identical preview vs. random letter string preview). We observed disruption for unspaced text and invalid preview conditions in both EMs and fixation-related potentials (FRPs). Unspaced and invalid preview conditions received longer reading times than spaced and valid preview conditions. In addition, the FRP data showed that unspaced previews disrupted reading in earlier time windows of analysis, compared to string preview conditions. Moreover, the effect of parafoveal preview was greater for spaced relative to unspaced conditions, in both EMs and FRPs. These findings replicate well-established preview effects, provide novel insight into the neural correlates of reading with and without inter-word spacing and suggest that spatial selection precedes lexical processing."
https://openalex.org/W2994958267,"Complexity analysis of glucose time series with Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) has been proved to be useful for the prediction of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) development. We propose a modified DFA algorithm, review some of its characteristics and compare it with other metrics derived from continuous glucose monitorization in this setting. Several issues of the DFA algorithm were evaluated: (1) Time windowing: the best predictive value was obtained including all time-windows from 15 minutes to 24 hours. (2) Influence of circadian rhythms: for 48-hour glucometries, DFA alpha scaling exponent was calculated on 24-hour sliding segments (1-hour gap, 23-hour overlap), with a median coefficient of variation of 3.2%, which suggests that analysing time series of at least 24-hour length avoids the influence of circadian rhythms. (3) Influence of pretreatment of the time series through integration: DFA without integration was more sensitive to the introduction of white noise and it showed significant predictive power to forecast the development of T2DM, while the pretreated time series did not. (4) Robustness of an interpolation algorithm for missing values: The modified DFA algorithm evaluates the percentage of missing values in a time series. Establishing a 2% error threshold, we estimated the number and length of missing segments that could be admitted to consider a time series as suitable for DFA analysis. For comparison with other metrics, a Principal Component Analysis was performed and the results neatly tease out four different components. The first vector carries information concerned with variability, the second represents mainly DFA alpha exponent, while the third and fourth vectors carry essentially information related to the two ""pre-diabetic behaviours"" (impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance). The scaling exponent obtained with the modified DFA algorithm proposed has significant predictive power for the development of T2DM in a high-risk population compared with other variability metrics or with the standard DFA algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2995011864,"Graph-based dimensionality reduction methods have attracted substantial attention due to their successful applications in many tasks, including classification and clustering. However, most classical graph-based dimensionality reduction approaches are only applied to data from one view. Hence, combining information from different data views has attracted considerable attention in the literature. Although various multi-view graph-based dimensionality reduction algorithms have been proposed, the graph construction strategies utilized in them do not adequately take noise and different importance of multiple views into account, which may degrade their performance. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely, Low-Rank Graph Optimization for Multi-View Dimensionality Reduction (LRGO-MVDR), that overcomes these limitations. First, we construct a low-rank shared matrix and a sparse error matrix from the graph that corresponds to each view for capturing potential noise. Second, an adaptive nonnegative weight vector is learned to explore complementarity among views. Moreover, an effective optimization procedure based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers scheme is utilized. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LRGO-MVDR algorithm outperforms related methods."
https://openalex.org/W2995357249,"The crisis of antimicrobial resistance is driving research into the phenomenon of collateral sensitivity. Sometimes, when a bacterium evolves resistance to one antimicrobial, it becomes sensitive to others. In this study, we have investigated the utility of Phenotype Microarray (PM) plates for identifying collateral sensitivities with unprecedented throughput. We assessed the relative resistance/sensitivity phenotypes of nine strains of Staphylococcus aureus (two laboratory strains and seven clinical isolates) towards the 72 antimicrobials contained in three PM plates. In general, the PM plates reported on resistance and sensitivity with a high degree of reproducibility. However, a rigorous comparison of PM growth phenotypes with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements revealed a trade-off between throughput and accuracy. Small differences in PM growth phenotype did not necessarily correlate with changes in MIC. Thus, we conclude that PM plates are useful for the rapid and high-throughput assessment of large changes in collateral sensitivity phenotypes during the evolution of antimicrobial resistance, but more subtle examples of cross-resistance or collateral sensitivity cannot be identified reliably using this approach."

Cortical conduction of the diaphragm was performed by TMS to all participants followed by cervical magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerve roots. Diaphragmatic resting motor threshold (DRMT), cortical motor evoked potential latency (CMEPL), CMEP amplitude (CMEPA), peripheral motor evoked potential latency (PMEPL), PMEP amplitude (PMEPA) and central motor conduction time (CMCT) were measured.66.7% of COPD patients had severe and very severe COPD with median age of 59 (55-63) years. There was statistically significant bilateral decrease in DRMT, CMEPA and PMEPA in COPD group versus healthy subjects and significant increase in CMEPL and PMEPL (p <0.01). Left CMCT was significantly prolonged in COPD group versus healthy subjects (p <0.0001) but not right CMCT. Further, there was significant increase in CMEPL and CMCT of left versus right diaphragm in COPD group (p = 0.003 and 0.001 respectively) that inversely correlated with FEV1% and FVC% predicted. Right and left DRMT were insignificantly different in COPD group (p >0.05) but positively correlated with FEV1/FVC, FEV1% and FVC% predicted.Central cortico-diaphragmatic motor system is affected in COPD patients with heterogeneity of both sides that is correlated with pulmonary function.Coticospinal pathway affection could be a factor for development of diaphragmatic dysfunction in COPD patients accordingly its evaluation could help in personalization of COPD management especially pulmonary rehabilitation programs."
https://openalex.org/W2996384960,"The ability to identify drivers responsible for algal community shifts is an important aspect of environmental issues. The lack of long-term datasets, covering periods prior to these shifts, is often limiting our understanding of drivers responsible. The freshwater alga, Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyceae), has significantly increased distribution and mass occurrences in Scandinavian lakes during the past few decades, often releasing a skin irritating slime that causes discomfort for swimmers. While the alga has been extensively studied, long-term data from individual lakes are often absent or greatly limited and drivers behind this species’ success are still not clear. However, if specific and persistent taxa biomarkers for G. semen could be detected in dated sediment cores, long-term data would be improved and more useful. To test for biomarkers, we examined the pigment composition of several G. semen strains in culture. Further, dated sediment core samples from Lake Lundebyvann, Norway, were used to test the pigments’ suitability as biomarkers in paleolimnological studies. Modifications to a common analysis allowed for the successful detection of the polar xanthophyll heteroxanthin and the non-polar chlorophyll a, as well as several other algal pigments by using high performance liquid chromatography-photometric diode arrays (HPLC-PDA). Heteroxanthin was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and detected by HPLC-PDA in all examined G. semen strains, along with chlorophyll a. Using HPLC-PDA, we also identified and confirmed the presence of the biomarker, xanthophyll heteroxanthin, in sediment core samples up to 60 years of age. The specificity of this xanthophyll was also tested by examining a wide range of algal strains from common Norwegian phytoplankton species. Heteroxanthin was not detected in any species commonly occurring in significant amounts in Norwegian lakes. We therefore conclude that heteroxanthin is a suitable pigment biomarker for G. semen and that this pigment can be successfully used for paleolimnological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2996579785,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the entry point to the secretory pathway and major site of protein biogenesis. Translocation of secretory and integral membrane proteins across or into the ER membrane occurs via the evolutionarily conserved Sec61 complex, a heterotrimeric channel that comprises the Sec61p/Sec61α, Sss1p/Sec61γ, and Sbh1p/Sec61β subunits. In addition to forming a protein-conducting channel, the Sec61 complex also functions to maintain the ER permeability barrier, preventing the mass free flow of essential ER-enriched molecules and ions. Loss in Sec61 integrity is detrimental and implicated in the progression of disease. The Sss1p/Sec61γ C terminus is juxtaposed to the key gating module of Sec61p/Sec61α, and we hypothesize it is important for gating the ER translocon. The ER stress response was found to be constitutively induced in two temperature-sensitive sss1 mutants (sss1ts) that are still proficient to conduct ER translocation. A screen to identify intergenic mutations that allow for sss1ts cells to grow at 37 °C suggests the ER permeability barrier to be compromised in these mutants. We propose the extreme C terminus of Sss1p/Sec61γ is an essential component of the gating module of the ER translocase and is required to maintain the ER permeability barrier."

However, effects of this surgery on neighboring structures have received little attention so far. In particular, no investigations on olfactory bulb (OB) anatomy after trans-sphenoidal surgery have been reported. Because impairment of olfaction has been shown in small groups following trans-sphenoidal surgery we hypothesized that the transnasal approach is likely to alter OB volume which is associated with changes of olfactory function.The study comprised 33 patients with pituitary adenoma (14 women and 19 men, mean age 50 years). Comprehensive assessment of olfactory function was conducted with the ""Sniffin' Sticks"" test kit. Based on magnetic resonance imaging scans OBs were measured before and approximately one year after trans-sphenoidal PA enucleation.Owing to postoperative non-compliance and MRI artifacts partly due to drill friction complete evaluation of ""Sniffin' Sticks"" in term of obtaining the TDI score was possible pre- and postoperatively in 21 patients whereas OB volumes were available in 32 patients. Approximately one year after surgery olfactory function was not significantly different from baseline. However, left- and right-sided OB volume in patients treated via trans-sphenoidal surgery decreased (p = 0.001). The side of the surgical approach did not affect OB volume in a side-specific manner. Changes in odor threshold were significantly correlated to changes in right-sided OB volume (r = 0.45, p = 0.024).Overall olfactory performance one year after surgery was not significantly different from baseline.

https://openalex.org/W2995985491,"This study examined the effects of SCUBA bubbles on fish counts in underwater visual surveys conducted in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (PMNM). Specifically, paired fish surveys were conducted at each survey site, utilizing two different gear types: open-circuit SCUBA (OC) and closed-circuit rebreather (CCR). Bubble exhaust released from the OC equipment is a potential source of bias for in-situ fish observations, as the associated audio and visual disturbances could either attract or repel fishes depending on whether their behavior is more driven by curiosity or caution. The study area, is a large (~1.5 million km2) and extremely remote marine protected area in which the response of coral reef fishes to divers represent natural behavior of naive fishes with little or no previous contact with humans. Historically, surveys conducted on OC in this area have shown an abundance of large roving piscivores and this study set out to determine the extant, if any, the audible and visual disturbances of OC bubbles have. The species typically seen in these prior surveys were Caranx ignobilis, Caranx melampygus, Aprion virescens, and a couple of species of sharks. We found differences in counts for some roving piscivores, including significantly more jacks observed on OC than CCR (Caranx ignobilis 57% more, and Caranx melampygus 113% more). Instance of first encounter, i.e. the time when a fish was first observed during a survey, also varied for some species. Higher numbers of Aprion virescens (p = 0.04), and C. melampygus (p = <0.001) were observed in the first 5-minutes of counts by divers on OC (i.e. when they were using breathing apparatus that produced noises that could be heard over long distances). Although not the focus of the study, we also assessed differences between OC and CCR counts for other groups of fishes. Estimated abundance of benthic damselfish was higher on OC than CCR, and counts of butterflyfish were lower on OC; but there were no significant differences for the other groups considered. This is an important control study that documents the natural responses of coral reef fishes to SCUBA bubbles generated by in-situ surveys."

Methods 96 patients with T2DM (diabetes group) without diabetes kidney disease (DKD) and 33 healthy subjects (control group) were enrolled in studies intended to assess the early changes in pulmonary function and intrarenal haemodynamics associated with diabetes, as well as to determine the correlation between pulmonary function and intrarenal haemodynamics. Results Pulmonary functional parameters were negatively correlated with HbA1c levels and diabetes duration (P< 0.05). Moreover, renal functional parameters were positively correlated with HbA1c levels and diabetes duration (P<0.05). Additionally, pulmonary functional parameters were negatively correlated with renal functional parameters (P<0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis of the relationship between pulmonary functional parameters and the bilateral kidney arterial resistivity index (RI) showed that all the pulmonary functional parameters were significantly correlated with the arterial RI (P< 0.05). Conclusions Patients displayed changes in pulmonary function and intrarenal haemodynamics during the preclinical stages of DKD. Regulating glycaemia may improve intrarenal haemodynamics in the bilateral interlobular renal arteries. Moreover, during the preclinical stages of DKD, the right kidney RI is a effective predictor of early changes in pulmonary function in adult T2DM patients.

https://openalex.org/W2995336959,"Serum phosphorus is a well-known marker of vascular calcification, but the effects of serum phosphorus abnormalities defined by clinical criteria on the outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remain unclear. We aimed to evaluate whether preoperative serum phosphorus abnormalities defined based on clinical criteria are associated with outcomes of CABG using a relatively new statistical technique, inverse probability weighting (IPW) adjustment.From January 2001 to December 2014, 4,989 consecutive patients who underwent CABG were stratified into normal (2.5-4.5 mg/dl; n = 4,544), hypophosphatemia (<2.5 mg/dl; n = 238), or hyperphophatemia (>4.5 mg/dl; n = 207) groups depending on preoperative serum phosphorus level.The primary outcome was all-cause death during a median follow-up of 48 months. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular death, graft failure, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and stroke. In multivariate Cox analysis, preoperative hypophosphatemia was significantly associated with all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-2.76; P = 0.01). However, this association varied depending on chronic kidney disease and emergent operation (p for interaction = 0.05 and 0.03, respectively). In addition, analysis after IPW adjustment demonstrated that preoperative serum phosphorus abnormalities were not significantly associated with all-cause death (P = 0.08) or any secondary outcomes except graft failure. Graft failure was significantly associated with preoperative hypophosphatemia (HR 2.51; 95% CI 1.37-4.61; P = 0.003).Our study showed that preoperative serum phosphorus abnormalities in clinical criteria were not associated with outcomes after CABG except for graft failure. And, the association of hypophosphatemia with graft failure remains to be evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2995513183,"Companies tend to publish financial reports in order to articulate strategies, disclose key performance measurements as well as summarise the complex relationships with external stakeholders as a result of their business activities. Therefore, any major changes to business models or key relationships will be naturally reflected within these documents, albeit in an unstructured manner. In this research, we automatically scan through a large and rich database, containing over 400,000 reports of companies in Japan, in order to generate structured sets of data that capture the essential features, interactions and resulting relationships among these firms. In doing so, we generate a citation type network where we empirically observe that node creation, annihilation and link rewiring to be the dominant processes driving its structure and formation. These processes prompt the network to rapidly evolve, with over a quarter of the interactions between firms being altered within every single calendar year. In order to confirm our empirical observations and to highlight and replicate the essential dynamics of each of the three processes separately, we borrow inspiration from ecosystems and evolutionary theory. Specifically, we construct a network evolutionary model where we adapt and incorporate the concept of fitness within our numerical analysis to be a proxy real measure of a company’s importance. By making use of parameters estimated from the real data, we find that our model reliably replicates degree distributions and motif formations of the citation network, and therefore reproducing both macro as well as micro, local level, structural features. This is done with the exception of the real frequency of bidirectional links, which are primarily formed as a result of an entirely separate and distinct process, namely the equity investments from one company into another."
