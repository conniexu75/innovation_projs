https://openalex.org/W2144702718,"Chrysopa carnea diapaused after experiencing a decrease in day length above the critical photoperiod. Animals experiencing increasing day lengths less than the critical photoperiod did not diapause, and those in diapause began to reproduce. These experiments are the first to demonstrate that insects respond to the direction of change in photoperiods (both increasing and decreasing) which do not encroach on the critical photoperiod."

https://openalex.org/W2013772552,"Large changes in lift output result when a simulated insect wing, undergoing a downstroke, is subjected to a dynamic change of incidence. Given a large positive rate of change of incidence, transient lift values several times those realized in steady-state operation at the same angle of incidence are obtained. Thus a means exists by which insects achieve several times the lift expected by conventional quasi-steady considerations."
https://openalex.org/W1984955417,"At Guryul Ravine near Srinagar, Kashmir, a varied fauna of productid brachiopods, including Spinomarginifera, is associated in approximately 15 feet (about 4 meters) of strata with the typical Scythian (Lower Triassic) pelecypod Claraia. These faunas are interpreted as true associations of surviving ""Permian"" and Lower Triassic faunal elements. Similar mixed associations have previously been identified in the lowest Triassic strata of the Salt Range and Surghar Range of West Pakistan."

https://openalex.org/W2083899844,"Fresh ice stalactites were observed beneath sea ice in Antarctica. They are hollow, tapering, inverted cones having a base diameter between 10 and 20 centimeters and a tip diameter of 4 to 10 centimeters extending downward about 100 centimeters. The stalactites form when dense, chilled brine drains downward from the ice sheet into seawater of norma1 salinity and near-freezing temperature."

https://openalex.org/W2064368417,"Only those persons very well versed in methods of technological change realize how short the time is that remains before the world must make a major shift from oil to coal for its industrial energy needs. The return to coal must provide for clean combustion and conversion to clean industrial fuels. The quickest way to capture significant supplies of new gas and oil is to convert existing boilers and furnaces to burn clean fuels from coal. The following processes that could be realized the soonest are discussed: gasification with steam and oxygen; partial conversion of coal; flash pyrolysis; partial gasification by steam; flash hydrogenation; supercritical gas extraction; chemicals from coal tar; and coal liquefaction. Work has been in progress for many years on rapid pyrolysis of coal in a plasma arc at temperatures beyond 1400/sup 0/C to make acetylene. It is believed the process has the potential of making acetylene competitive with ethylene, but acetylene can only substitute for ethylene in about 17 percent of its uses. 47 references. (MCW)"
https://openalex.org/W2068447327,"Problems to be solved and advantages offered in the recycling of municipal solid wastes are analyzed. The development of materials recovery systems is still in an elementary stage except for ferrous metals recovery. However, only a very small fraction of municipal solid waste is subjected to any type of materials recovery. The problems to be solved in the recovery of nonferrous metals, potentially the most valuable recovered products, are summarized. Glass recovery and plastics recovery are considered. The production of fuel from municipal wastes is receiving increasing interest as one way to alleviate the oil shortages. Problems other than technical to be solved in the recycling of municipal solid wastes are indicated. (JSR)"
https://openalex.org/W1976691635,"Supplies of basic commodities cannot be taken for granted in the future. The prospects for peace in coming decades will depend on how the world adjusts to new constraints and new expectations regarding these commodities. Exponential growth cannot go on forever. This is realized not only from the quadrupling of oil prices, but also the prospect of eventual physical limitations to materials supply. Supplies of raw materials are being profoundly affected by the trend toward nationalization of foreign-owned mining properties and other measures to give effective control over natural resources to the host country. High energy prices are making prohibitively expensive the recovery of some low-grade ores and forcing reconsideration of energy-intensive processing methods. New concern about the environmental impact of mining, lumbering, and materials processing and increasing restriction of access to resources on public lands are also constraining materials production. Financial markets that have made capital raising difficult have also added to the conditions creating a new world of materials. It is remarkable that the cumulative impact of these developments has not yet disrupted the supply of materials in a major way. (MCW)"

https://openalex.org/W2016347566,"This article traces U.S. materials policy since World War I, characterizes the abrupt change in the status of materials in the mid-1970's, and discusses contemporary approaches and concepts that respond to this change; it concludes that national materials policy-making in the United States has been a succession of fragmented, incoherent spasms. Materials policy is complex because it is affected by different groups with different problems and different options to achieve the range of objectives. There is no way that national policy can fully meet all national needs. The author suggests three future policies in materials. First, we should identify those economic, technological, and political elements that encourage or discourage good materials management and respond to these findings. Second, we should maintain surveillance of all aspects of national materials management to detect emerging obstacles to good performance and lags in execution. Third, we should develop an institutional capability for (i) quickly correcting sudden deficiencies in national materials management, and (ii) detecting and gradually correcting undesirable trends in the management of the materials cycle.

https://openalex.org/W1969403642,"The tensions between availability of materials and quality of the environment will increase with economic growth and the appreciation of environmental values. These tensions can be relieved to an extent by internalizing the costs of environmental protection so that they are reflected in the price of materials. Economic incentives and disincentives, such as effluent fees, are receiving renewed attention (5, pp. 49-51). In addition, government regulation to protect the environment will, perhaps arbitrarily, affect the availability and use of materials. The report, Man, Materials, and Environment (5, p. 25), concluded that: A national materials policy should be based upon the principle that calculations of benefits and costs associated with the extraction, transport, processing, use, and disposal of materials should take full account of the value of common property resources and of any change in the value of common properties resulting from the impact of materials on the environment; and should support the principle that those responsible for impairment of the environment should bear the costs of damage or repair. These principles should become a commonplace element of property rights, legislation, and administrative practice at all levels of government. The difficulty of measuring benefits and costs should not delay adoption of these principles but suggests the need for continuous observation and experimentation. Environmental protection regulations will result in: (i) increased costs for many materials; (ii) disruptive changes in use of materials, due to environmental characteristics and revised cost effectiveness calculations; (iii) restrictions on the siting of processing and manufacturing installations; (iv) preemption of access and surface rights to some mineral bearing lands, particularly those that are federally controlled; (v) diversion of capital from new production facilities; and (vi) frustrating delays in decisions, such as those affecting leasing and plant siting. In return for these generally undesirable disruptions in the continued development and supply of materials, society will obtain: (i) improved quality of air and water; (ii) long-term protection of the natural ecosystems of which man is a part; (iii) more efficient allocation of natural resources on the basis of more accurate and complete accounting of costs; (iv) improved human health through decreased contamination of the environment with toxic substances; and (v) conservation of materials through a closing of the production, use, and disposal cycle. Ingenuity and a more complete understanding of the parts and interactions of the energy, materials, and environment system can do much to reduce the tensions in these conflicts and bring about equitable trade-offs among societal goals."
