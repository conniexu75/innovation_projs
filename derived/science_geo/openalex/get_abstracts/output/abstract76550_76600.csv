https://openalex.org/W2034078201,"WHETHER amphetamine exerts its behavioural excitatory action in the brain directly or indirectly by interference or synergism with the catecholamines (noradrenaline and dopamine) is open to debate1,2. The advent of α-methyl para-tyrosine3 (α-MPT), which inhibits the in vivo synthesis of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)—the physiological precursor of the catecholamines—offers a new way of investigating this problem."

https://openalex.org/W2031207218,"A STUDY of free amino-acids and related compounds in a red alga, Gymnogongrus flabelliformis, revealed the presence of two different substances, both containing a guanylurea moiety. One was afterwards identified as 1 - amidino - 3 - (3 - carboxypropyl)urea or γ - guanyl-ureido)butyric acid (I)1, and we propose here to call it ‘gongrine’. It is now reported that the other compound has been designated ‘gigartinine’ and shown to be N5-(amidinocarbamoyl)-L-ornithine or L-α-amino-γ-(guanyl-ureido)valeric acid (II)."

https://openalex.org/W2042673808,"INFORMATION on the behaviour of water in biological cells is essential to developing an understanding of the roles of that ubiquitous molecule in biological systems. This communication reports observations of nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of cod muscle over a period of time from shortly after death to the cessation of rigor mortis, which suggests that cellular water suffers a loss in structure and an increase in mobility during this time."
https://openalex.org/W1968267451,"IT has been shown that physico-chemical changes occur when connective tissue is treated with water that has been subjected to ultrasonic vibrations1. The suggestion has been advanced that chemically active substances are formed through the ionization of the water in such ultrasonic fields, and that peroxides are probably involved2."

https://openalex.org/W2029982318,"WHEN studying Gerbillus piramidum and Jaculus jaculus, Khalil and Abdel-Messeih1 claimed that the tissues of desert mammals contained less water than did those of non-desert ones. Several other workers (for example, the Schmidt-Nielsens2) found that desert animals lost less water through their skins. The data obtained by Khalil and Abdel-Messeih1 suggest that the low water content in the tissues of desert animals (including the skin) contributes to the decreased loss in water and thus represents an important adaptation of animals to the environmental conditions of the desert."
