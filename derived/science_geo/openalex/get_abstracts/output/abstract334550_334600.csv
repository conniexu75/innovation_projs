https://openalex.org/W2136733582,"The reaction between methane and oxygen over platinum and rhodium surfaces in metalcoated ceramic monoliths can be made to produce mostly hydrogen and carbon monoxide (greater than 90% selectivity for both) with almost complete conversion of methane and oxygen at reaction times as short as 10(-3) seconds. This process has great promise for conversion of abundant natural gas into liquid products such as methanol and hydrocarbons, which can be easily transported from remote locations. Rhodium was considerably superior to platinum in producing more H(2) and less H(2)O, which can be explained by the known chemistry and kinetics of reactants, intermediates, and products on these surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2030033169,"Single-domain microcrystals of LaC2 encapsulated within nanoscale polyhedral carbon particles have been synthesized in a carbon arc. Typical particle sizes are on the order of 20 to 40 nanometers. The stoichiometry and phase of the La-containing crystals have been assigned from characteristic lattice spacings observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). EDS spectra show that La and C are the only elements present. Characteristic interatomic distances of 3.39 and 2.78 angstroms identify the compound inside the nanoparticle cavities as α-LaC2, the phase of LaC2 that is stable at room temperature. Bulk α-LaC2 is metallic and hydrolytic. Observation of crystals of pure encapsulated α-LaC2 that were exposed to air for several days before analysis indicates that the LaC2 is protected from degradation by the carbon polyhedral shells of the nanoparticles. A high percentage of the carbon nanoparticles have encapsulated LaC2 single crystals. These carbon-coated metal crystals form a new class of materials that can be protected in their pure or carbide forms and may have interesting and useful properties."
https://openalex.org/W2078126741,"A homogeneous system for the selective, catalytic oxidation of methane to methanol via methyl bisulfate is reported. The net reaction catalyzed by mercuric ions, Hg(II), is the oxidation of methane by concentrated sulfuric acid to produce methyl bisulfate, water, and sulfur dioxide. The reaction is efficient. At a methane conversion of 50 percent, 85 percent selectivity to methyl bisulfate (∼43 percent yield; the major side product is carbon dioxide) was achieved at a molar productivity of 10–7 mole per cubic centimeter per second and Hg(II) turnover frequency of 10–3 per second. Separate hydrolysis of methyl bisulfate and reoxidation of the sulfur dioxide with air provides a potentially practical scheme for the oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen. The primary steps of the Hg(II)-catalyzed reaction were individually examined and the essential elements of the mechanism were identified. The Hg(II) ion reacts with methane by an electrophilic displacement mechanism to produce an observable species, CH3HgOSO3H, 1. Under the reaction conditions, 1 readily decomposes to CH3OSO3H and the reduced mercurous species, Hg22+. The catalytic cycle is completed by the reoxidation of Hg22+ with H2SO4 to regenerate Hg(II) and byproducts SO2 and H2O. Thallium(III), palladium(II), and the cations of platinum and gold also oxidize methane to methyl bisulfate in sulfuric acid."
https://openalex.org/W2018814001,"Cataclysmic flooding is a geomorphological process of planetary significance. Landforms of flood origin resulted from late Pleistocene ice-dammed lake failures in the Altay Mountains of south-central Siberia. Peak paleoflows, which exceeded 18 x 10(6) cubic meters per second, are comparable to the largest known terrestrial discharges of freshwater and show a hydrological scaling relation to floods generated by catastrophic dam failures. These seem to have been Earth's greatest floods, based on a variety of reconstructed paleohydraulic parameters."

This realization of a strange attractor in physical space is a rare instance where there is a firm quantitative connection between the dimension of an experimentally observed fractal spatial pattern and the process producing it."
https://openalex.org/W2092885122,"The competitive displacement by a sexual gecko species of an asexual resident gecko has been documented over a wide geographic area. To test hypotheses concerning the detailed mechanism of this displacement, an experimental system was developed to follow populations of geckos in a duplicated, controlled environment that closely approximates the natural arena for the competitive interaction. Asymmetric competition occurred only in the presence of light, which attracts a dense concentration of insect food sources. The mechanism of competition was partly due to the behavioral dominance of the larger sexual species over the smaller asexual species in areas near the concentrated food. However, this behavior resulted from an avoidance response of subordinate asexuals rather than overt aggression by the sexual species."
https://openalex.org/W2073031750,"The spins of the terrestrial planets likely arose as the planets formed by the accretion of planetesimals. Depending on the masses of the impactors, the planet's final spin can either be imparted by many small bodies (ordered accretion), in which case the spin is determined by the mean angular momentum of the impactors, or by a few large bodies (stochastic accretion), in which case the spin is a random variable whose distribution is determined by the root-mean-square angular momentum of the impactors. In the case of ordered accretion, the planet's obliquity is expected to be near 0 degrees or 180 degrees , whereas, if accretion is stochastic, there should be a wide range of obliquities. Analytic arguments and extensive orbital integrations are used to calculate the expected distributions of spin rate and obliquity as a function of the planetesimal mass and velocity distributions. The results imply that the spins of the terrestrial planets are determined by stochastic accretion."

Early results from one of the instruments, the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope, are reviewed here. Among these are new insights concerning the origin of the ultraviolet light from the old stellar population in elliptical galaxies, new evidence for a hot, gaseous corona surrounding the Milky Way, improved views of the physical conditions in active galactic nuclei, and a measurement of the ionization state of the local interstellar medium."

https://openalex.org/W2002796551,"Immense progress has been made in understanding the sea since 1945. However, because during this time much of the research has had military implications, oceanography science is particularly vulnerable to shifts in national priorities away from the military. The Ocean Studies Board of the National Research Council recently published a review and discussion of the state of marine science. Concerns about the future lie in several directions. Basic research is no longer the primary thrust of government agencies, many of who must respond to short term applications and regulatory requirements. Federal and nonfederal organization structures are not as effective as they once were and lack effective coordination. Flat budgets, an increasing number of marine scientists, increasing costs of maintaining state of the art including the interaction with space technology, and problems not defined in broad enough terms are also concerns. The article poses questions and points out the critical importance of finding a new mechanism for maintaining quality of marine science. 1 ref., 2 figs."

https://openalex.org/W2081268107,"The economic implications of using catalytic methods to make methane more reactive and usable are discussed. Natural gas is an excellent and often wasted source of energy that could become a rival for petroleum as a fuel and chemical feedstock if it were made safer and easier to transport. Current methods for producing both liquid methane and synthetic gas are energy intensive and high temperature processes. The process Hickman and Schmidt have developed flows room-temperature methane and air through a coated, heated ceramic disk. The Catalytica group has found another method of partially oxidizing methane into methanol using sulfuric acid and a catalytic amount of metal ions. The industry must take a close look at these new conversion methods."
