https://openalex.org/W2051555727,"FORKING of the short-root system of pine is frequent in Nature and is known to be due to the influence of mycorrhizal mycelia and probably also to certain other types of root fungi. Slankis1 has demonstrated that in excised pine roots growing in a nutritive solution, forking can be produced by exudates of mycorrhizal fungi (for example, species of Boletus) and by growth substances like β-indoleacetic acid and α-naphthaleneacetic acid."

This book systematically presents that information. The authors, of course, describe the harmful effects that sometimes follow the use of cosmetics, but it is to be noted with interest that the book contains a chapter also on the benefits that may result from their use. Such a chapter could not well have been written a generation ago. In fact, the book throughout minimizes the long-held opinion that cosmetics are frequent sources of trouble because dermatitis from this or that substance ""has not been reported."" Dermatitis from cosmetics occurs more often than this book would indicate, despite the lack of reports. Practically all types of cosmetics are discussed. There are some omissions, such as brilliantines and after-shave lotions, for instance; and mention"

In the usual fractionation procedures only one of the isomers, at most, is obtained pure, the other remaining contaminated. A high degree of purity is realized only at the expense of yield. The difficulties inherent in isotopic synthesis make the above operations increasingly wasteful, thus further limiting the practicability of these methods."

Results have been satisfactory so far as sterilization is concerned, and there appears to be a minimum change in chemical and physical properties of the soil, though certain changes have been reported1."
https://openalex.org/W1990565144,"AMELLIN, which has been found to have beneficial effects in clinical and experimental diabetes1–3, has recently been observed by one of us (S. P.) in a preliminary investigation on the depancreatized dog to have the property of completely preventing the fatty degeneration of the liver. It was reported earlier by Nath and Brahmachari4 that amellin (given orally) in the daily dose of 25 mgm. per kgm. can cause considerable desaturation of the liver fat, which according to Schoenheimer and Rittenberg5 is an indication of increased fat metabolism. Nath and Chakrabarti3 have also recorded the prevention of tumorous growth in the livers of the animals with acetoacetate-induced diabetes, by simultaneous injection of amellin in a dose of 10 mgm. per kgm. Studies were therefore undertaken to observe the lipotropic effect of amellin in experimental animals."
