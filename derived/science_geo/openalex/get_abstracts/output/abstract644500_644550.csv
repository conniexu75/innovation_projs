https://openalex.org/W2995298529,"Extrachromosomal circularization of DNA is an important genomic feature in cancer. However, the structure, composition and genome-wide frequency of extrachromosomal circular DNA have not yet been profiled extensively. Here, we combine genomic and transcriptomic approaches to describe the landscape of extrachromosomal circular DNA in neuroblastoma, a tumor arising in childhood from primitive cells of the sympathetic nervous system. Our analysis identifies and characterizes a wide catalog of somatically acquired and undescribed extrachromosomal circular DNAs. Moreover, we find that extrachromosomal circular DNAs are an unanticipated major source of somatic rearrangements, contributing to oncogenic remodeling through chimeric circularization and reintegration of circular DNA into the linear genome. Cancer-causing lesions can emerge out of circle-derived rearrangements and are associated with adverse clinical outcome. It is highly probable that circle-derived rearrangements represent an ongoing mutagenic process. Thus, extrachromosomal circular DNAs represent a multihit mutagenic process, with important functional and clinical implications for the origins of genomic remodeling in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2994737554,"To understand how the brain processes sensory information to guide behavior, we must know how stimulus representations are transformed throughout the visual cortex. Here we report an open, large-scale physiological survey of activity in the awake mouse visual cortex: the Allen Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset. This publicly available dataset includes the cortical activity of nearly 60,000 neurons from six visual areas, four layers, and 12 transgenic mouse lines in a total of 243 adult mice, in response to a systematic set of visual stimuli. We classify neurons on the basis of joint reliabilities to multiple stimuli and validate this functional classification with models of visual responses. While most classes are characterized by responses to specific subsets of the stimuli, the largest class is not reliably responsive to any of the stimuli and becomes progressively larger in higher visual areas. These classes reveal a functional organization wherein putative dorsal areas show specialization for visual motion signals."
https://openalex.org/W2994940889,"R-loops are nucleic acid structures formed by an RNA:DNA hybrid and unpaired single-stranded DNA that represent a source of genomic instability in mammalian cells1–4. Here we show that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, contributing to different aspects of messenger RNA metabolism5,6, is detectable on the majority of RNA:DNA hybrids in human pluripotent stem cells. We demonstrate that m6A-containing R-loops accumulate during G2/M and are depleted at G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle, and that the m6A reader promoting mRNA degradation, YTHDF2 (ref. 7), interacts with R-loop-enriched loci in dividing cells. Consequently, YTHDF2 knockout leads to increased R-loop levels, cell growth retardation and accumulation of γH2AX, a marker for DNA double-strand breaks, in mammalian cells. Our results suggest that m6A regulates accumulation of R-loops, implying a role for this modification in safeguarding genomic stability. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is prevalent at RNA:DNA hybrids in human pluripotent stem cells. The m6A reader YTHDF2 interacts with R-loop-enriched loci in dividing cells, and YTHDF2 loss leads to increased R-loop levels and accumulation of γH2AX."
https://openalex.org/W2995488791,"Theories stipulate that memories are encoded within networks of cortical projection neurons. Conversely, GABAergic interneurons are thought to function primarily to inhibit projection neurons and thereby impose network gain control, an important but purely modulatory role. Here we show in male mice that associative fear learning potentiates synaptic transmission and cue-specific activity of medial prefrontal cortex somatostatin (SST) interneurons and that activation of these cells controls both memory encoding and expression. Furthermore, the synaptic organization of SST and parvalbumin interneurons provides a potential circuit basis for SST interneuron-evoked disinhibition of medial prefrontal cortex output neurons and recruitment of remote brain regions associated with defensive behavior. These data suggest that, rather than constrain mnemonic processing, potentiation of SST interneuron activity represents an important causal mechanism for conditioned fear."

https://openalex.org/W2995254124,"Monoamine oxidase (MAO) metabolizes cytosolic dopamine (DA), thereby limiting auto-oxidation, but is also thought to generate cytosolic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We show that MAO metabolism of DA does not increase cytosolic H2O2 but leads to mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activity. This is dependent upon MAO anchoring to the outer mitochondrial membrane and shuttling electrons through the intermembrane space to support the bioenergetic demands of phasic DA release."
https://openalex.org/W2994999940,"Humans tend to discount information that undermines past choices and judgments. This confirmation bias has significant impact on domains ranging from politics to science and education. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying this fundamental characteristic of belief formation. Here we report a mechanism underlying the confirmation bias. Specifically, we provide evidence for a failure to use the strength of others' disconfirming opinions to alter confidence in judgments, but adequate use when opinions are confirmatory. This bias is related to reduced neural sensitivity to the strength of others' opinions in the posterior medial prefrontal cortex when opinions are disconfirming. Our results demonstrate that existing judgments alter the neural representation of information strength, leaving the individual less likely to alter opinions in the face of disagreement."
https://openalex.org/W2996429202,"Around implantation, the epiblast (Epi) transits from naïve to primed pluripotency, before giving rise to the three germ layers. How chromatin is reconfigured during this developmental window remains poorly understood. We performed a genome-wide investigation of chromatin landscapes during this period. We find that enhancers in ectoderm are already pre-accessible in embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) Epi when cells enter a primed pluripotent state. Unexpectedly, strong trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) emerges at developmental gene promoters in E6.5 Epi and positively correlates with H3K27me3, thus establishing bivalency. These genes also show enhanced spatial interactions. Both the strong bivalency and spatial clustering are virtually absent in preimplantation embryos and are markedly reduced in fate-committed lineages. Finally, we show that KMT2B is essential for establishing bivalent H3K4me3 at E6.5 but becomes partially dispensable later. Its deficiency leads to impaired activation of developmental genes and subsequent embryonic lethality. Thus, our data characterize lineage-specific chromatin reconfiguration and a unique chromatin state for primed pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2996538150,"Background:
Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a common adverse presentation of primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in adolescence and later, but is rarely recognized in early childhood where primary EBV infection commonly occurs. It is not known what triggers IM, and also not why IM risk upon primary EBV infection (IM attack rate) seemingly varies between children and adolescents. IM symptoms may be severe and persist for a long time. IM also markedly elevates the risk of Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple sclerosis for unknown reasons. The way IM occurrence depends on age and sex is incompletely described and hard to interpret etiologically, because it depends on three quantities that are not readily observable: the prevalence of EBV-naϊve persons, the hazard rate of seroconverting and the attack rate, i.e. the fraction of primary EBV infections that is accompanied by IM. We therefore aimed to provide these quantities indirectly, to obtain epidemiologically interpretable measures of the dynamics of IM occurrence to provide etiological clues.

Methods and findings:
We used joint modeling of EBV prevalence and IM occurrence data to provide detailed sex- and age-specific EBV infection rates and IM attack rates and derivatives thereof for a target population of all Danes age 0–29 years in 2006–2011. We demonstrate for the first time that IM attack rates increase dramatically rather precisely in conjunction to typical ages of puberty onset. The shape of the seroconversion hazard rate for children and teenagers confirmed a priori expectations and underlined the importance of what happens at age 0–2 years. The cumulative risk of IM before age 30 years was 13.3% for males and 22.4% for females. IM is likely to become more common through delaying EBV infection in years to come.

Conclusions:
The change in attack rate at typical ages of puberty onset suggests that the immunologic response to EBV drastically changes over a relatively short age-span. We speculate that these changes are an integrated part of normal sexual maturation. Our findings may inform further etiologic research into EBV-related diseases and vaccine design. Our methodology is applicable to the epidemiological study of any infectious agent that establishes a persistent infection in the host and the sequelae thereof."
https://openalex.org/W2995367735,"Valvular heart disease is observed in approximately 2% of the general population1. Although the initial observation is often localized (for example, to the aortic or mitral valve), disease manifestations are regularly observed in the other valves and patients frequently require surgery. Despite the high frequency of heart valve disease, only a handful of genes have so far been identified as the monogenic causes of disease2–7. Here we identify two consanguineous families, each with two affected family members presenting with progressive heart valve disease early in life. Whole-exome sequencing revealed homozygous, truncating nonsense alleles in ADAMTS19 in all four affected individuals. Homozygous knockout mice for Adamts19 show aortic valve dysfunction, recapitulating aspects of the human phenotype. Expression analysis using a lacZ reporter and single-cell RNA sequencing highlight Adamts19 as a novel marker for valvular interstitial cells; inference of gene regulatory networks in valvular interstitial cells positions Adamts19 in a highly discriminatory network driven by the transcription factor lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 downstream of the Wnt signaling pathway. Upregulation of endocardial Krüppel-like factor 2 in Adamts19 knockout mice precedes hemodynamic perturbation, showing that a tight balance in the Wnt–Adamts19–Klf2 axis is required for proper valve maturation and maintenance. Mutations in ADAMTS19 lead to progressive heart valve disease in humans. Analysis of mice lacking Adamts19 highlights the role of a Wnt–Adamts19–Klf2 axis in proper valve function."
https://openalex.org/W2995916287,"Reproductive stage drought stress is an important yield reducing factor in rainfed rice. Genetic mapping of morpho-physiological traits under the stress will help to develop cultivars suitable for drought prone environments through marker-assisted breeding (MAB). Though various yield QTLs under reproductive stage drought tolerance are available for MAB, but no robust markers controlling different morho-physiological traits are available for this stress tolerance. QTLs linked to morpho-physiological traits under drought stress were mapped by evaluating 190 F7 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) using bulk segregant analysis (BSA) strategy. Wide variations were observed in the RILs for eleven morpho-physiological traits involved during the stress. A total of 401 SSR primers were surveyed for parental polymorphism of which 77 were detected to be polymorphic. Inclusive composite interval mapping detected a total of five consistent QTLs controlling leaf rolling (qLR9.1), leaf drying (qLD9.1), harvest index (qHI9.1), spikelet fertility (qSF9.1) and relative water content (qRWC9.1) under reproductive stage drought stress. Another two non-allelic QTLs controlling leaf rolling (qLR8.1) and leaf drying (qLD12.1) were also detected to be linked and found to control the two traits. QTL controlling leaf rolling, qLR8.1 was validated in this mapping population and may be useful in MAB programs. Out of these five consistent QTLs, four (qLR9.1, qLD9.1, qHI9.1 and qRWC9.1) were detected to be novel QTLs and useful for MAB for improvement of reproductive stage drought tolerance in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2995458798,"Tonoplast Intrinsic Proteins (TIP) are plant aquaporins that are primarily localized in the tonoplast and play a role in the bidirectional flux of water and other substrates across a membrane. In barley, eleven members of the HvTIP gene subfamily have been identified. Here, we describe the transcription profile of the HvTIP genes in the leaves of barley seedlings being grown under optimal moisture conditions, drought stress and a re-watering phase. The applied drought stress caused a 55% decrease in the relative water content (RWC) in seedlings, while re-watering increased the RWC to 90% of the control. Our analysis showed that all HvTIP genes, except HvTIP3;2, HvTIP4;3 and HvTIP5.1, were expressed in leaves of ten-day-old barley seedlings under optimal water conditions with the transcripts of HvTIP2;3, HvTIP1;2 and HvTIP1;1 being the most abundant. We showed, for the first time in barley, a significant variation in the transcriptional activity between the analysed genes under drought stress. After drought treatment, five HvTIP genes, which are engaged in water transport, were down-regulated to varying degrees, while two, HvTIP3;1 and HvTIP4;1, were up-regulated. The HvTIP3;1 isoform, which is postulated as transporting hydrogen peroxide, expressed the highest increase of activity (ca. 5000x) under drought stress, thus indicating its importance in the response to this stress. Re-hydration caused the return of the expression of many genes to the level that was observed under optimal moisture conditions or, at least, a change in this direction Additionally, we examined the promotor regions of HvTIP and detected the presence of the cis-regulatory elements that are connected with the hormone and stress responses in all of the genes. Overall, our results suggest that 7 of 11 studied HvTIP (HvTIP1;1, HvTIP1;2, HvTIP2;1, HvTIP2;2, HvTIP2;3, HvTIP3;1, HvTIP4;1) have an important function during the adaptation of barley to drought stress conditions. We discuss the identified drought-responsive HvTIP in terms of their function in the adaptation of barley to this stress."
https://openalex.org/W2995680992,"Glucose is an important nutrient that dictates the development, fertility and lifespan of all organisms. In humans, a deficit in its homeostatic control might lead to hyperglucemia and the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes, which show a decreased ability to respond to and metabolize glucose. Previously, we have reported that high-glucose diets (HGD) induce alterations in triglyceride content, body size, progeny, and the mRNA accumulation of key regulators of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans (PLoS ONE 13(7): e0199888). Herein, we show that increasing amounts of glucose in the diet induce the swelling of both mitochondria in germ and muscle cells. Additionally, HGD alter the enzymatic activities of the different respiratory complexes in an intricate pattern. Finally, we observed a downregulation of ceramide synthases (hyl-1 and hyl-2) and antioxidant genes (gcs-1 and gst-4), while mitophagy genes (pink-1 and dct-1) were upregulated, probably as part of a mitohormetic mechanism in response to glucose toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2995649581,"Aim of this study was to investigate the activation of the IFNγ pathway in the affected liver and in the blood of patients with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). To this purpose, the mRNA expression levels of IFNG and IFNγ-inducible genes as well as Tyrosine (701)-phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) protein levels were evaluated in the liver and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of three patients with sHLH with predominant liver involvement. The mRNA expression levels of IFNG and IFNγ-inducible genes were markedly higher in patient livers compared to control livers and to one disease control liver. Conversely, slight differences in the expression levels of Type I IFN-inducible genes and other classical inflammatory cytokine genes were found. Further supporting the activation of the IFNγ pathway, higher protein levels of phosphorylated and total STAT1 were detected in patient livers compared to control livers. When the expression of the same genes analysed in liver tissues was evaluated in PBMCs collected from 2 out of 3 patients before the liver biopsy, we found that mRNA levels of IFNγ-inducible genes were markedly increased. Accordingly, high circulating levels of IFNγ-inducible CXCL9 were observed in patients. Altogether, these data demonstrate the selective and marked up-regulation of the IFNγ pathway in the liver tissue and blood of patients with active sHLH. Finally, we show that measurement of circulating CXCL9 levels and evaluation of IFNγ–inducible gene expression levels in PBMCs may represent a new valid tool to better identify patients with suspected HLH with predominant liver involvement."
https://openalex.org/W2996507705,"Non-adherence to therapy is associated with impaired outcome in solid organ allograft recipients. Outcome data are limited after lung transplantation. In a single-center cohort study, adherence was assessed in 427 patients undergoing lung transplantation from 2010 to 2013. Objective criteria of adherence were judged by health care workers on every visit on a five item Likert scale including trough level monitoring, home spirometry and contact with an overall rating of adherence between 0 and 100%. Cut-off values for good vs. suboptimal adherence were defined retrospectively. Primary outcome was allograft survival, secondary outcomes were patient survival, prevalence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction, hospitalizations, renal function and quality of life. Follow-up ended on 31st December 2018. Median adherence was 86% on 6,623 visits, this cut-off was used as a discriminator between good and suboptimal adherers. Patients with good adherence within the first three years showed better 5-year allograft (74% vs. 60%, p = 0.003) and patient survival (79% vs. 64%, p<0.001) and lower prevalence of chronic allograft dysfunction (33% vs. 45%, p = 0.011) after 5 years compared to patients with suboptimal adherence. A multidimensional adherence score proved to be a simple tool to assess adherence in clinical practice. Suboptimal adherence was associated with impaired outcome in lung transplant patients."
https://openalex.org/W2995163379,"Background Genital herpes simplex infection affects more than 500 million people worldwide. We have previously shown that COR-1, a therapeutic HSV-2 polynucleotide vaccine candidate, is safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects. Objective Here, we present a single center double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized phase I/IIa trial of COR-1 in HSV-2 positive subjects in which we assessed safety and tolerability as primary endpoints, and immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy as exploratory endpoints. Methods Forty-four HSV-2+ subjects confirmed by positive serology or pathology, and positive qPCR during baseline shedding, with a recurrent genital HSV-2 history of at least 12 months including three to nine reported lesions in 12 months prior to screening, aged 18 to 50 years females and males with given written informed consent, were randomized into two groups. Three immunizations at 4-week intervals and one booster immunization at 6 months, each of 1 mg COR-1 DNA or placebo, were administered intradermally as two injections of 500 μg each to either one forearm or both forearms. Results No serious adverse events, life-threatening events or deaths occurred throughout the study. As expected, HSV-2 infected subjects displayed gD2-specific antibody titers prior to immunization. COR-1 was associated with a reduction in viral shedding after booster administration compared with baseline. Conclusions This study confirms the previously demonstrated safety of COR-1 in humans and indicates a potential for use of COR-1 as a therapy to reduce viral shedding in HSV-2 infected subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2996560501,"Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a risk factor for neurocognitive impairment in severe malaria (SM), but the impact of AKI on long-term behavioral outcomes following SM is unknown. Methods We conducted a prospective study on behavioral outcomes of Ugandan children 1.5 to 12 years of age with two forms of severe malaria, cerebral malaria (CM, n = 226) or severe malarial anemia (SMA, n = 214), and healthy community children (CC, n = 173). AKI was defined as a 50% increase in creatinine from estimated baseline. Behavior and executive function were assessed at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months later using the Child Behavior Checklist and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, respectively. Age-adjusted z-scores were computed for each domain based on CC scores. The association between AKI and behavioral outcomes was evaluated across all time points using linear mixed effect models, adjusting for sociodemographic variables and disease severity. Results AKI was present in 33.2% of children with CM or SMA at baseline. Children ≥6 years of age with CM or SMA who had AKI on admission had worse scores in socio-emotional function in externalizing behaviors (Beta (95% CI), 0.52 (0.20, 0.85), p = 0.001), global executive function (0.48 (0.15, 0.82), p = 0.005) and behavioral regulation (0.66 (0.32, 1.01), p = 0.0002) than children without AKI. There were no behavioral differences associated with AKI in children <6 years of age. Conclusions AKI is associated with long-term behavioral problems in children ≥6 years of age with CM or SMA, irrespective of age at study enrollment."
https://openalex.org/W2995736080,"The successful parasitisation of a plant by a phytophagous insect is dependent on the delivery of effector molecules into the host. Sedentary gall forming insects, such as grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae Fitch, Phylloxeridae), secrete multiple effectors into host plant tissues that alter or modulate the cellular and molecular environment to the benefit of the insect. The identification and characterisation of effector proteins will provide insight into the host-phylloxera interaction specifically the gall-induction processes and potential mechanisms of plant resistance. Using proteomic mass spectrometry and in-silico secretory prediction, 420 putative effectors were determined from the salivary glands or the root-feeding D. vitifoliae larvae reared on Teleki 5C (V. berlandieri x V. riparia). Among them, 170 conserved effectors were shared between D. vitifoliae and fourteen phytophagous insect species. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of five conserved effector candidates (protein disulfide-isomerase, peroxidoredoxin, peroxidase and a carboxypeptidase) revealed that their gene expression decreased, when larvae were starved for 24 h, supporting their assignment as effector molecules. The D. vitifoliae effectors identified here represent a functionally diverse group, comprising both conserved and unique proteins that provide new insight into the D. vitifoliae-Vitis spp. interaction and the potential mechanisms by which D. vitifoliae establishes the feeding site, suppresses plant defences and modulates nutrient uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2995954267,"Photosynthetic efficiency has become the target of several breeding programs since the positive correlation between photosynthetic rate and yield in soybean suggests that the improvement of photosynthetic efficiency may be a promising target for new yield gains. However, studies on combining ability of soybean genotypes for physiological traits are still scarce in the literature. The objective of this study was to estimate the combining ability of soybean genotypes based on F2 generation aiming to identify superior parents and segregating populations for physiological traits. Twenty-eight F2 populations resulting from partial diallel crossings between eleven lines were evaluated in two crop seasons for the physiological traits: photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, internal CO2 concentration, and transpiration. General combining ability (GCA) of the parents and specific combining ability (SCA) of the F2 populations were estimated. Our findings reveal the predominance of additive effects in controlling the traits. The genotype TMG 7062 IPRO is the most promising parent for programs aiming at photosynthetic efficiency. We have also identified other promising parents and proposed cross-breeding with higher potential for obtaining superior lines for photosynthetic efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2994723825,"The environmental stress response (ESR) is critical for cell survival. Yeast cells unable to synthesize inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are unable to induce the ESR. We recently discovered a diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (PP-InsP5) phosphatase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoded by SIW14 Yeast strains deleted for SIW14 have increased levels of PP-InsPs. We hypothesized that strains with high inositol pyrophosphate levels will have an increased stress response. We examined the response of the siw14Δ mutant to heat shock, nutrient limitation, osmotic stress, and oxidative treatment using cell growth assays and found increased resistance to each. Transcriptional responses to oxidative and osmotic stresses were assessed using microarray and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. The ESR was partially induced in the siw14Δ mutant strain, consistent with the increased stress resistance, and the mutant strain further induced the ESR in response to oxidative and osmotic stresses. The levels of PP-InsPs increased in WT cells under oxidative stress but not under hyperosmotic stress, and they were high and unchanging in the mutant. Phosphatase activity of Siw14 was inhibited by oxidation that was reversible. To determine how altered PP-InsP levels affect the ESR, we performed epistasis experiments with mutations in rpd3 and msn2/4 combined with siw14Δ. We show that mutations in msn2Δ and msn4Δ, but not rpd3, are epistatic to siw14Δ by assessing growth under oxidative stress conditions and expression of CTT1 Msn2-GFP nuclear localization was increased in the siw14Δ. These data support a model in which the modulation of PP-InsPs influence the ESR through general stress response transcription factors Msn2/4."

Evidence of criterion-related validity was examined via associations (i.e., correlations) between the BFPTSQ domains and a wide variety of mental health outcomes. College students (n = 2158) from the USA (n = 1117 [63.21% female]), Argentina (n = 353 [65.72% female]) and Spain (n = 688 [66.86% female]) completed an online survey. Of the tested models, an Exploratory Structural Equation Model (ESEM) fit the data best. Multigroup ESEM and ESEM-within-CFA generally supported the measurement invariance of the questionnaire across groups. Internalizing symptomatology, rumination and low happiness were related mainly to low emotional stability across countries, while low agreeableness and low conscientiousness were related chiefly to externalizing symptomology (i.e., antisocial behavior and drug outcomes). Some correlational differences arose across countries and are discussed. Our findings generally support the BFPTSQ as an adequate measure to assess the Big Five personality domains in Spanish- and English-speaking young adults."
https://openalex.org/W2994733649,"Background Congenital obstructive nephropathy is the main cause of end-stage renal disease in infants and children. Renal insufficiency is due to impaired growth and maturation in the developing kidney with obstruction. Congenital obstructive nephropathy leads to cytokine mediated inflammation and the development of interstitial fibrosis. The Janus kinase-2 (JAK-2) and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription’-3 (STAT3) are involved in cytokine production, inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis. Methods We studied the role of JAK2/STAT3 in a model of congenital obstructive nephropathy using unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in neonatal mice at the second day of life. Cytokine production, inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis were analyzed in obstructed and sham operated kidneys of neonatal mice treated with or without JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor Tyrphostin AG490. To mimic obstruction and distension, proximal tubular cells were stretched in vitro. Results We show that STAT3 is highly activated in the developing kidney with obstruction and in proximal tubular cells following stretch. JAK2/STAT3 activation mediates cytokine release and leukocyte recruitment into neonatal kidneys after UUO. Pharmacological blockade of JAK2/STAT3 by Tyrphostin AG490 reduced inflammation, tubular apoptosis, and interstitial fibrosis. JAK2/STAT3 blockade decreased pro-inflammatory and profibrotic mediators in tubular cells. Conclusion Our findings provide evidence that JAK2/STAT3 mediates inflammation and fibrosis in the developing kidney with obstruction. Blocking JAK2/STAT3 may prove beneficial in congenital obstructive nephropathy in children."
https://openalex.org/W2996502020,"Diabetes is a life-long and debilitating disease that is fraught with both acute and chronic complications. Of particular concern to sufferers of the disease is the development of foot problems. These problems range from foot deformities to slowly healing or non-healing ulcers (that may necessitate amputation) and in the worst-case scenario, to death. Identification and prompt treatment of comorbid conditions, such as anemia may improve outcome in patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). We determined the prevalence of anemia in Nigerians with DFU and its impact on disease outcome.We prospectively followed 336 patients with diabetes hospitalized for DFU and managed by a multidisciplinary team until discharge or death. Demographic and diabetes-related information and ulcer characteristics were documented. We evaluated each patient for neuropathy, vasculopathy and medical co-morbidities. Relevant laboratory and imaging studies were performed. We present the results of the sub-group analysis of patients with anemia to determine its prevalence and impact on disease outcome in patients with DFU in the MEDFUN study.Anemia was detected in 180(53.6%) subjects with 88(48.9%) of them requiring blood transfusion. Significant demographic and clinical determinants of anemia were ulcer duration more than one month prior to hospitalization (p<0.009), PAD (p<0.001) and presence of gangrene (p<0.001). The comorbid conditions that were significantly associated with anemia included proteinuria (p<0.003), osteomyelitis (p<0.006), moderate (p<0.002) as well as severe (p<0.001) vascular stenosis, history of stroke (p<0.014) and renal impairment (p<0.002). Anemia was significantly associated with poor wound healing (p<0.009), amputation (p<0.036) and risk of death (p<0.034).We detected anemia in more than half of our cohort with DFU. We found significant association between anemia and poor wound healing, amputation and mortality among our studied subjects. Future studies should explore whether prompt correction of anemia in subjects hospitalized for DFU would improve outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2994751481,"Acupuncture needles have become an increasingly-popular treatment tool used by multiple health professions. However, the World Health Organization (WHO)'s 1999 training guidelines for acupuncture address only medical doctors and licensed acupuncturists, leaving a gap as to appropriate training standards for other professions.With reference to an extensive document analysis, and interviews with seventeen acupuncture educators from across several professions in Ontario, Canada, this work uses a critical qualitative policy analytic approach to: a) present a comprehensive account of statutory training requirements for acupuncture-needling physiotherapists and chiropractors in the United States, Canada, and Australia; and b) evaluate competing stakeholder discourses pertaining to recent related controversies.A wide range of educational requirements are evident across the jurisdictions under study (most below the 200-hour WHO guideline for physicians); and there is considerable disagreement among stakeholders as to what constitutes sufficient training in various forms of acupuncture, including 'dry needling'. Organizations defending brief post-graduate training for needling physiotherapists and chiropractors are generally associated with these two professions, and contend that their 'dry needling' practices differ substantially from traditional acupuncture. Characterizing such brief training as insufficient, opportunistic and unsafe, and 'dry needling' as a subset of acupuncture practice, are the voices of all acupuncture educators interviewed, as well as professional organizations representing physicians, licensed acupuncturists, and some physiotherapists and chiropractors.Critiquing claims on both sides of the debate, this work calls for the development of independent, international safety-geared training guidelines that explicitly address the recent, evidence-informed trend towards biomedicalized acupuncture needling. Findings also suggest a need for additional research regarding the current shift towards overlapping-rather than exclusive-health professional practice scopes in industrialized countries."
https://openalex.org/W2995674602,"Lactate in the brain is considered an important fuel and signalling molecule for neuronal activity, especially during neuronal activation. Whether lactate is shuttled from astrocytes to neurons or from neurons to astrocytes leads to the contradictory Astrocyte to Neuron Lactate Shuttle (ANLS) or Neuron to Astrocyte Lactate Shuttle (NALS) hypotheses, both of which are supported by extensive, but indirect, experimental evidence. This work explores the conditions favouring development of ANLS or NALS phenomenon on the basis of a model that can simulate both by employing the two parameter sets proposed by Simpson et al. (J Cereb. Blood Flow Metab., 27:1766, 2007) and Mangia et al. (J of Neurochemistry, 109:55, 2009). As most mathematical models governing brain metabolism processes, this model is multi-scale in character due to the wide range of time scales characterizing its dynamics. Therefore, we utilize the Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) algorithm, which has been used extensively in multi-scale systems of reactive flows and biological systems, to identify components of the system that (i) generate the characteristic time scale and the fast/slow dynamics, (ii) participate to the expressions that approximate the surfaces of equilibria that develop in phase space and (iii) control the evolution of the process within the established surfaces of equilibria. It is shown that a decisive factor on whether the ANLS or NALS configuration will develop during neuronal activation is whether the lactate transport between astrocytes and interstitium contributes to the fast dynamics or not. When it does, lactate is mainly generated in astrocytes and the ANLS hypothesis is realised, while when it doesn’t, lactate is mainly generated in neurons and the NALS hypothesis is realised. This scenario was tested in exercise conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2995798545,"Discovery studies in animals constitute a cornerstone of biomedical research, but suffer from lack of generalizability to human populations. We propose that large-scale interrogation of these data could reveal patterns of animal use that could narrow the translational divide. We describe a text-mining approach that extracts translationally useful data from PubMed abstracts. These comprise six modules: species, model, genes, interventions/disease modifiers, overall outcome and functional outcome measures. Existing National Library of Medicine natural language processing tools (SemRep, GNormPlus and the Chemical annotator) underpin the program and are further augmented by various rules, term lists, and machine learning models. Evaluation of the program using a 98-abstract test set achieved F1 scores ranging from 0.75–0.95 across all modules, and exceeded F1 scores obtained from comparable baseline programs. Next, the program was applied to a larger 14,481 abstract data set (2008–2017). Expected and previously identified patterns of species and model use for the field were obtained. As previously noted, the majority of studies reported promising outcomes. Longitudinal patterns of intervention type or gene mentions were demonstrated, and patterns of animal model use characteristic of the Parkinson’s disease field were confirmed. The primary function of the program is to overcome low external validity of animal model systems by aggregating evidence across a diversity of models that capture different aspects of a multifaceted cellular process. Some aspects of the tool are generalizable, whereas others are field-specific. In the initial version presented here, we demonstrate proof of concept within a single disease area, Parkinson’s disease. However, the program can be expanded in modular fashion to support a wider range of neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2995192514,"Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD) is a significant viral disease caused by rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) in China, which results in 30% yield losses in affected summer maize-growing areas. In this study, two connected recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations were constructed to elucidate the genetic basis of resistance during two crop seasons. Ten quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to MRDD were detected in the two RILs. Individual QTLs accounted for 4.97–23.37% of the phenotypic variance explained (PVE). The resistance QTL (qZD-MRDD8-1) with the largest effect was located in chromosome bin 8.03, representing 16.27–23.37% of the PVE across two environments. Interestingly, one pair of common significant QTLs was located in the similar region on chromosome 4 in both populations, accounting for 7.11–9.01% of the PVE in Zheng58×D863F (RIL-ZD) and 9.43–13.06% in Zheng58×ZS301 (RIL-ZZ). A total of five QTLs for MRDD resistance trait showed significant QTL-by-Environment interactions (QEI). Two candidate genes associated with resistance (GDSL-lipase and RPP13-like gene) which were higher expressed in resistant inbred line D863F than in susceptible inbred line Zheng58, were located in the physical intervals of the major QTLs on chromosomes 4 and 8, respectively. The identified QTLs will be studied further for application in marker-assisted breeding in maize genetic improvement of MRDD resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2995527708,"Anthropologists and religious scholars have long debated the relationship between doctrinal Theravada Buddhism, so-called ‘animism’, and other folk practices in southeast Asian societies. A variety of models of this relationship have been proposed on the basis of ethnographic evidence. We provide the first psychometric and quantitative evaluation of these competing models, using a new scale developed for this purpose, the Burmese Buddhist Religiosity Scale. Having tested existing hypotheses in our first study (n = 2285) we formulated an alternative model, which was then tested in our second study (n = 3377). We argue that this model provides support for a two-dimensional distinction between great and little traditions, shedding light on decades-old theoretical debates. Far from being in conflict, the transnational religious tradition of the literati and the variegated religious practices of locals appear to be reflected in two complementary dimensions of religiosity. This distinction has been heretofore neglected in psychometric research, but arguably merits attention beyond Buddhism, in the psychology of religion more generally. Our findings suggest that, insofar as research on religiosity relies on doctrinal pronouncements denigrating little traditions as mere superstition, it may be blinded to a crucial dimension of religious life."
https://openalex.org/W2994672737,"The importance of geographic location and annual variation on the detection of differences in the rhizomicrobiome caused by the genetic modification of maize (Bt-maize, event MON810) was evaluated at experimental field sites across Europe including Sweden, Denmark, Slovakia and Spain. DNA of the rhizomicrobiome was collected at the maize flowering stage in three consecutive years and analyzed for the abundance and diversity of PCR-amplified structural genes of Bacteria, Archaea and Fungi, and functional genes for bacterial nitrite reductases (nirS, nirK). The nirK genes were always more abundant than nirS. Maize MON810 did not significantly alter the abundance of any microbial genetic marker, except for sporadically detected differences at individual sites and years. In contrast, annual variation between sites was often significant and variable depending on the targeted markers. Distinct, site-specific microbial communities were detected but the sites in Denmark and Sweden were similar to each other. A significant effect of the genetic modification of the plant on the community structure in the rhizosphere was detected among the nirK denitrifiers at the Slovakian site in only one year. However, most nirK sequences with opposite response were from the same or related source organisms suggesting that the transient differences in community structure did not translate to the functional level. Our results show a lack of effect of the genetic modification of maize on the rhizosphere microbiome that would be stable and consistent over multiple years. This demonstrates the importance of considering annual variability in assessing environmental effects of genetically modified crops."
https://openalex.org/W2996168255,"Alcohol is associated with depression among adolescents, but variations in the association by age and sex are relatively unexplored. This study aims to assess variations in the association between alcohol consumption and depressed mood among adolescents by age and sex.We analyzed data from a school-based survey of 38,186 students in junior high school (Year 7 and 9) and senior high school (Year 11). The mean age of the participants was 15.2 (SD = 1.9) years. We used multivariate logistic regression to measure the association between self-reported alcohol drinking (past-year, past-month, and binge-drinking) and history of depressed mood for two weeks or more during the past year. We stratified the analyses by school level (as proxy for age group) and sex of the respondent.Approximately 1% of students in surveyed schools refused to answer the questionnaires and fewer than 5% of all questionnaires were invalid. Prevalence of depressed mood was 13.2%. Prevalence of past-year alcohol drinking was 41.0% among those with depressed mood vs. 24.6% among those with no depressed mood (Adj OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.60, 1.98). The association was strongest among girls in junior high school (Adj OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 2.03, 2.79) and weakest among boys in senior high school (Adj OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.99, 1.42).Associations between alcohol drinking and depressed mood were particularly strong among junior high school girls. Youth mental health and alcohol programs should consider prioritizing this sub-group accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W2994704039,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the novel image-based noise reduction software (NRS) improves image quality, and to assess the feasibility of using this software in combination with hybrid iterative reconstruction (IR) in image quality on thin-slice abdominal CT. In this retrospective study, 54 patients who underwent dynamic liver CT between April and July 2017 and had a body mass index higher than 25 kg/m2 were included. Three image sets of each patient were reconstructed as follows: hybrid IR images with 1-mm slice thickness (group A), hybrid IR images with 5-mm slice thickness (group B), and hybrid IR images with 1-mm slice thickness denoised using NRS (group C). The mean image noise and contrast-to-noise ratio relative to the muscle of the aorta and liver were assessed. Subjective image quality was evaluated by two radiologists for sharpness, noise, contrast, and overall quality using 5-point scales. The mean image noise was significantly lower in group C than in group A (p < 0.01), but no significant difference was observed between groups B and C. The contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly higher in group C than in group A (p < 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively). Subjective image quality was also significantly higher in group C than in group A (p < 0.01), in terms of noise and overall quality, but not in terms of sharpness and contrast (p = 0.65 and 0.07, respectively). The contrast of images in group C was greater than that in group A, but this difference was not significant. Compared with hybrid IR alone, the novel NRS combined with a hybrid IR could result in significant noise reduction without sacrificing image quality on CT. This combined approach will likely be particularly useful for thin-slice abdominal CT examinations of overweight patients."
https://openalex.org/W2994869217,"The fat body, a multifunctional organ analogous to the liver and fat tissue of vertebrates, plays an important role in insect life cycles. The fat body is involved in protein storage, energy metabolism, elimination of xenobiotics, and production of immunity regulator-like proteins. However, the molecular mechanism of the fat body's physiological functions in the tephritid stem gall-forming fly, Procecidochares utilis, are still unknown. In this study, we performed transcriptome analysis of the fat body of P. utilis using Illumina sequencing technology. In total, 3.71 G of clean reads were obtained and assembled into 30,559 unigenes, with an average length of 539 bp. Among those unigenes, 21,439 (70.16%) were annotated based on sequence similarity to proteins in NCBI's non-redundant protein sequence database (Nr). Sequences were also compared to NCBI's non-redundant nucleotide sequence database (Nt), a manually curated and reviewed protein sequence database (SwissProt), and KEGG and gene ontology annotations were applied to better understand the functions of these unigenes. A comparative analysis was performed to identify unigenes related to detoxification, immunity and energy metabolism. Many unigenes involved in detoxification were identified, including 50 unigenes of putative cytochrome P450s (P450s), 18 of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), 35 of carboxylesterases (CarEs) and 26 of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Many unigenes related to immunity were identified, including 17 putative serpin genes, five peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) and four lysozyme genes. In addition, unigenes potentially involved in energy metabolism, including 18 lipase genes, five fatty acid synthase (FAS) genes and six elongases of very long chain fatty acid (ELOVL) genes, were identified. This transcriptome improves our genetic understanding of P. utilis and the identification of a numerous transcripts in the fat body of P. utilis offer a series of valuable molecular resources for future studies on the functions of these genes."
https://openalex.org/W2996571435,"Background Entropy is a thermodynamic variable statistically correlated with the disorder of a system. The hypothesis that entropy can be used to identify potentially unhealthy conditions was first suggested by Schrödinger, one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics. Shannon later defined entropy as the quantity of information stored in a system. Shannon’s entropy has the advantage of being adaptable across a variety of disciplines, including genetic studies on complex immunogenetic systems such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) systems. Methods In our study, entropy associated to the HLA and KIR systems was compared between a cohort of 619 Sardinian healthy controls and a group of 270 patients affected by multiple sclerosis (MS), the latter stratified into 81 patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and 189 patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Results The entropy associated to HLA four-loci haplotypes (A, B, C, DR) and combinations of two inhibitory KIR genes was significantly higher in patients affected by RRMS than in healthy controls. No significant differences were observed for patients with PPMS. By calculating the total HLA and KIR entropy ratio in each subject, it was possible to determine the individual risk of developing MS, particularly RRMS. Conclusions In addition to the standard statistical methods used to evaluate immunogenetic parameters associated to immune-mediated disease, the analysis of entropy measures the global disorder status deriving from these parameters. This innovative approach may represent a useful complementary tool to the risk assessment of immune-mediated disorders. Improved risk assessment is particularly important for family members of patients with MS. However, further investigation is warranted to confirm our findings and to evaluate the validity of the entropy-based method in other types of immune-mediated disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2995553103,"Aims To investigate practice effects in a test-retest situation, where vibration perception thresholds (VPT) were measured in healthy subjects using a multi-frequency test method. Methods In eight consecutive tests, VPTs were tested in the pulps of the index and little fingers at seven frequencies (8, 16, 32, 64, 125, 250 and 500 Hz). Subjects were twenty healthy adults aged 26 to 65 years (mean 46.0 ± 11.1 years; 10 male and 10 female). The subjects were examined at six tests with intervals of one month (mean 33 ± 6; time 0 to month 5) and at two additional tests with prolonged intervals (month 12 and 18). Linear mixed model analysis was performed to investigate differences over the subsequent test occasions. To examine where potential practice effects occurred, a pairwise comparison with Bonferroni correction was made. Results Small decreases in VPTs were found in 8 out of the 14 frequencies (index finger: 8, 16, 32, 250 and 500 Hz; little finger: 16, 250 and 500 Hz) within the test period from time 0 to month 5. In tests at 12 and 18 months, VPTs were increased compared to month 5, but lowered in comparison with time 0. Hence, minor significant decreases were found in three frequencies for the index finger (125, 250 and 500 Hz) and one frequency for the little finger (250 Hz) when examining VPTs with prolonged time intervals. Conclusions When evaluating vibration perception thresholds in a clinically relevant time period of once or twice a year, no consideration of practice effects is necessary when interpreting the results."
https://openalex.org/W2995318955,"Smoking is a well-known risk factor for stroke. However, the relationship between smoking trajectories during the life course and stroke is not known.We aimed to study the association of smoking trajectories and smoked pack-years with risk of ischemic and haemorrhagic strokes in a population-based birth cohort followed up to 50 years of age.Within the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966, 11,999 persons were followed from antenatal period to age 50 years. The smoking behaviour was assessed with postal questionnaires at ages 14, 31 and 46 years. Stroke diagnoses were collected from nationwide registers using unique study number linkage. The associations between smoking behaviour and stroke risk were estimated using Cox regression models.Six different patterns in smoking habits throughout the life course were found in trajectory modelling. During 542,140 person-years of follow-up, 352 (2.9%) persons had a stroke. Continuous smoking during the life course was associated with increased stroke risk (HR = 1.69; 95% CI 1.10-2.60) after adjusting for sex, educational level, family history of strokes, leisure-time physical activity, body mass index, alcohol consumption, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. Per every smoked pack-year the stroke risk increased 1.04-fold (95% CI 1.03-1.06). Other smoking trajectories were not significantly associated with stroke risk, nor were starting or ending age of smoking.Accumulation of smoking history is associated with increased risk of stroke until age of 50 years. The increased stroke risk does not depend on the age at which smoking started. Given that the majority starts smoking at young age, primary prevention of strokes should focus on adolescent smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2996198734,"Background As breast cancer represents a major morbidity and mortality burden in the U.S., with about one in eight women developing invasive breast cancer over her lifetime, accurate low-cost screening is an important public health issue. First-degree family history, often simplified as a dichotomous or three-level categorical variable (0/1/>1) based on number of affected relatives, is an important risk factor for many conditions. However, detailed family structure information such as the total number of first-degree relatives, and for each, their current or death age, and age at diagnosis are also important for risk prediction. Methods We develop a family history score under a Bayesian framework, based on first-degree family structure. We tested performance of the proposed score using data from a large prospective cohort study of women with a first-degree breast cancer family history. We used likelihood ratio tests to evaluate whether the proposed score added additional information to a Cox model with known breast cancer risk factors and the three-level family history variable. We also compared prediction performance through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and goodness-of-fit testing. Results Our proposed Bayesian family history score improved fit compared to the commonly used three-level family history score, both without and with adjustment for other risk factors (likelihood ratio tests p = 0.003 without adjustment for other risk factors, and p = 0.007 and 0.009 under adjustment with two candidate sets of risk factors). AUCs of ROC curves for the two models were similar, though in all cases were higher after addition of the BFHS. Conclusions Capturing detailed family history data through the proposed family history score can improve risk assessment and prediction. Such approaches could enable better-targeted personalized screening schedules and prevention strategies."

Herein, the effects of EBI on the swelling power, color, pasting, and sensory properties of white rice after short-term storage were analyzed. Samples were electron-beam irradiated at 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 kGy and stored at 25 °C or 37 °C for up to 75 days. Results showed that swelling power and major pasting viscosities (including peak, breakdown, and setback viscosities) at both storage temperatures decreased with increased irradiation dose. Negative correlations were also observed between the major viscosities of pasting properties and irradiation dose at both storage temperatures. During sensory evaluation, extremely low scores for rice hardness, appearance, taste, and overall acceptability were obtained for rice subjected to high EBI dose (>4 kGy). However, rice stored at 37 °C showed lower performance than rice at 25 °C in terms of the abovementioned parameters. By contrast, the sensory properties at irradiation doses between 2 and 4 kGy were better than those of the control group at both storage temperatures. All these findings indicated the potential of low-dose (<4 kGy) EBI as pretreatment for improving the quality of white rice during storage."
https://openalex.org/W2996448102,"Recently, we developed a partial differential equation (PDE) that relates the age-specific prevalence of a chronic disease with the age-specific incidence and mortality rates in the illness-death model (IDM). With a view to planning population-wide interventions, the question arises how prevalence can be calculated if the distribution of a risk-factor in the population shifts. To study the impact of such possible interventions, it is important to deal with the resulting changes of risk-factors that affect the rates in the IDM. The aim of this work is to show how the PDE can be used to study such effects on the age-specific prevalence of a chronic disease, to demonstrate its applicability and to compare the results to a discrete event simulation (DES), a frequently used simulation technique. This is done for the first time based on the PDE which only needs data on population-wide epidemiological indices and is related to the von Foerster equation. In a simulation study, we analyse the effect of a hypothetical intervention against type 2 diabetes. We compare the age-specific prevalence obtained from a DES with the results predicted from modifying the rates in the PDE. The DES is based on 10000 subjects and estimates the effect of changes in the distributions of risk-factors. With respect to the PDE, the change of the distribution of risk factors is synthesized to an effective rate that can be used directly in the PDE. Both methods, DES and effective rate method (ERM) are capable of predicting the impact of the hypothetical intervention. The age-specific prevalences resulting from the DES and the ERM are consistent. Although DES is common in simulating effects of hypothetical interventions, the ERM is a suitable alternative. ERM fits well into the analytical theory of the IDM and the related PDE and comes with less computational effort."
https://openalex.org/W2995130016,"This study aimed to identify the factors capable of mortality prediction in patients on hemodialysis, using a prospective cohort with three years of follow-up. We hypothesized that lack of clinical-metabolic control, impairment of nutritional status, and inadequate food consumption are risk factors for mortality in this population. This is a longitudinal study on a non-probabilistic sample of 85 adults and elderly patients undergoing hemodialysis, aged ≥ 18 years (66.0% male, 61.6±13.7 years). Data on anthropometric, biomarkers, body composition and food intake were obtained. Predictors of mortality were evaluated using Cox regression analysis. During the three years follow-up, 16 patients (18.8%) died. We observed that age (HR = 1.319, CI 95% = 1.131-1.538), calcium-phosphorus product (HR = 1.114, CI 95% = 1.031-1.205), ferritin (HR = 1.001, CI 95% = 1.001-1.002), nitric oxide (HR = 1.082, CI 95% = 1.006-1.164), and vitamin C intake (HR = 1.005, CI 95% = 1.001-1.009) were positively associated with mortality. Serum iron (HR = 0.717, CI 95% = 0.567-0.907), triceps skinfold thickness (HR = 0.704, CI 95% = 0.519-0.954), lean mass (HR = 0.863, CI 95% = 0.787-0.945), and the ratio of dietary monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fat (HR = 0.022, CI 95% = 0.001-0.549) were independent negative predictors of mortality. Our results suggest that dietary intake is also a predictor of mortality in patients on hemodialysis, besides nutritional status, body composition, oxidative stress, inflammation, and bone metabolism, indicating the importance of evaluation of these factors altogether for better prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2995210929,"Background In the Republic of Korea (ROK), compared to other high-income countries, tuberculosis (TB) prevalence is relatively high. Active TB and latent TB infection (LTBI) surveillance of individuals living in TB-affected households has been conducted for several years. Although active case finding is an important strategy in low-prevalence, high-income countries, its effectiveness in a high prevalence setting is unclear. This study evaluated the risk of TB in household contact by calculating the incidence of TB among household contacts and comparing it with the general population of the ROK. Methods A retrospective cohort study, including 36,133 household-contacts of 17,958 TB patients reported in 2015, was conducted. The data was extracted from the Korean National TB Surveillance System (web-based TB cases notification system, KNTSS). The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to evaluate risk factors for incidence of TB. A P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant. Results In this study, 319 (0.9%) of 36,133 household-contacts were reported as having TB within 1 year, which is a higher rate than the rate for the general population in the ROK. The rate of TB reported for contacts that had completed LTBI treatment (0.6%) was lower than for the LTBI group without treatment (4.6%). In multivariate analysis, age older than 65 (p < .001), being a spouse of a TB patient (p = .007), and LTBI without treatment (p = .013) were each a risk factor for TB incidence among contacts. Younger age (p < .001), presence of a cough (p < .001), testing positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB; p < .001), and cavity on radiograph (p < .001) of the index patient were also statistically significant risk factors. Conclusions Individuals living in TB-affected households are at high risk of developing TB in the ROK and active case finding among them is a strategy effective in the early detection and prevention of TB."
https://openalex.org/W2995343937,"Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in a marked decrease in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality, the therapeutic benefit is often limited by side effects such as metabolic derangement such as lipodystrophy and hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. These side effects are pervasive in people living with HIV (PLWH). However, the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. We investigated the effects of ART on cholesterol biosynthesis genes. This is a retrospective analysis of data and specimens collected during a cross-sectional, case-control study of ART-induced toxicity. Cases were HIV treatment-experienced individuals with HIV viral suppression and no diagnosis of ART-associated toxicity (n = 18), and controls were HIV-uninfected individuals (n = 18). The mRNA expressions of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) and ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) were significantly upregulated in cases (HIV+) compared to controls (HIV-), as well as the corresponding protein expression level of HMGCR. We observed dysregulation between sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP-2, sensory control) and HMGCR and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) pathways. Dysregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes may predate clinical manifestation of ART-induced lipid abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W2995633738,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic arbovirus with important livestock and human health, and economic consequences across Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Climate and vegetation monitoring guide RVFV forecasting models and early warning systems; however, these approaches make monthly predictions and a need exists to predict primary vector abundances at finer temporal scales. In Kenya, an important primary RVFV vector is the mosquito Aedes mcintoshi. We used a zero-inflated negative binomial regression and multimodel averaging approach with georeferenced Ae. mcintoshi mosquito counts and remotely sensed climate and topographic variables to predict where and when abundances would be high in Kenya and western Somalia. The data supported a positive effect on abundance of minimum wetness index values within 500 m of a sampling site, cumulative precipitation values 0 to 14 days prior to sampling, and elevated land surface temperature values ~3 weeks prior to sampling. The probability of structural zero counts of mosquitoes increased as percentage clay in the soil decreased. Weekly retrospective predictions for unsampled locations across the study area between 1 September and 25 January from 2002 to 2016 predicted high abundances prior to RVFV outbreaks in multiple foci during the 2006–2007 epizootic, except for two districts in Kenya. Additionally, model predictions supported the possibility of high Ae. mcintoshi abundances in Somalia, independent of Kenya. Model-predicted abundances were low during the 2015–2016 period when documented outbreaks did not occur, although several surveillance systems issued warnings. Model predictions prior to the 2018 RVFV outbreak indicated elevated abundances in Wajir County, Kenya, along the border with Somalia, but RVFV activity occurred west of the focus of predicted high Ae. mcintoshi abundances."
https://openalex.org/W2996086736,"Communication between resource users has repeatedly been shown to be of significant importance in environmental management. The proposed causal mechanisms are numerous, ranging from the ability of users to share information to their ability to negotiate solutions to common problems and dilemmas. However, what is less known is under what conditions these potential causal mechanisms are important and if, in cases when different means other than communication were available, whether they would be more effective in accomplishing these objectives. An example of such an alternative could be that instead of (or in addition to) users being reliant on within-group communication to acquire useful information an intermediary-such as a public agency-could provide that for them. Furthermore, the different causal mechanisms making communication beneficial might not be independent, neither in respect to each other, nor in respect to other externally imposed means to facilitate better environmental management, and not in regards to different contextual factors. This study makes use of laboratory experiments in an innovative way to explore these questions and specifically test the relative importance of communication in managing complex social-ecological system characterized by common-pool resource dilemmas, ecological interdependencies, and asymmetric resource access-all characteristics being present simultaneously. We find that when resources users are confronted with such a complex challenge, the ability to communicate significantly increases individual and group performance. What is more surprising is the negative effect on overall outcomes that providing external information has on outcomes, when the users also have the ability to communicate. By analysing the content of the conversations we are able to suggest several possible explanations on how the combination of external information provisioning and user communications act to increase individual cognitive load and drives intra-group competition, leading to a significant reduction of individual and group outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2994834210,"The present study examined the effects of selective digital deafferentation on the multi-finger synergies as a function of total force requirement and the number of digits involved in isometric pressing. 12 healthy adults participated in maximal and sub-maximal isometric pressing tasks with or without digital anesthesia to selective digits from the right hand. Our results indicate that selective anesthesia paradigm induces changes in both anesthetized (local) and non-anesthetized (non-local) digits' performance, including: (1) decreased maximal force abilities in both local and non-local digits; (2) reduced force share during multi-finger tasks from non-local but not local digits; (3) decreased force error-making; and (4) marginally increased motor synergies. These results reinforce the contribution of somatosensory feedback in the process of maximal voluntary contraction force, motor performance, and indicate that somatosensation may play a role in optimizing secondary goals during isometric force production rather than ensuring task performance."

Although convenient and inexpensive, they have uncertain validity. We sought to assess the accuracy of longitudinally-collected automated survey responses compared to medical records. Using data collected from a well-characterized, prospective birth cohort over the first year of life, we examined concordance between guardians' reports of their infants' health care visits ascertained by weekly automated survey (IVR or email) and those identified by medical chart review. Among 180 survey-visit pairs, concordance was 51%, with no change as number of visits per baby increased. Accuracy of recall was higher by email compared to IVR (61 vs. 43%; adjusted OR = 2.5 95% CI: 1.3-4.8), did not vary by health care encounter type (hospitalization: 50%, ER: 64%, urgent care: 44%, primary care: 52%; p = 0.75), but was higher for fever (77%, adjusted OR = 5.1 95%CI: 1.5-17.7) and respiratory illness (58%, adjusted OR = 2.9 95%CI: 1.5-5.8) than for other diagnoses. For the 75 mothers in these encounters, 69% recalled at least one visit; among 41 mothers with two or more visits, 85% recalled at least one visit. Predictors of accurate reporting by mothers after adjusting for illness in the baby included increased age and increased years of education (age per year, β = 0.05, p = 0.03; education per year, β = 0.08, p = 0.04). Additional strategies beyond use of automated surveys are needed to ascertain accurate health care utilization in longitudinal cohort studies, particularly in healthy populations with little motivation for accurate reporting."
