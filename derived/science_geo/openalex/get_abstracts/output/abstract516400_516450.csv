https://openalex.org/W2059145054,"Specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs) marks the beginning of the totipotent state. However, without a tractable experimental model, the mechanism of human PGC (hPGC) specification remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate specification of hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) from germline competent pluripotent stem cells. The characteristics of hPGCLCs are consistent with the embryonic hPGCs and a germline seminoma that share a CD38 cell-surface marker, which collectively defines likely progression of the early human germline. Remarkably, SOX17 is the key regulator of hPGC-like fate, whereas BLIMP1 represses endodermal and other somatic genes during specification of hPGCLCs. Notable mechanistic differences between mouse and human PGC specification could be attributed to their divergent embryonic development and pluripotent states, which might affect other early cell-fate decisions. We have established a foundation for future studies on resetting of the epigenome in hPGCLCs and hPGCs for totipotency and the transmission of genetic and epigenetic information."
https://openalex.org/W2013739762,"Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), an innate source of the type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-5 and -13, participate in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Although type 2 immunity is critically important for mediating metabolic adaptations to environmental cold, the functions of ILC2s in beige or brown fat development are poorly defined. We report here that activation of ILC2s by IL-33 is sufficient to promote the growth of functional beige fat in thermoneutral mice. Mechanistically, ILC2 activation results in the proliferation of bipotential adipocyte precursors (APs) and their subsequent commitment to the beige fat lineage. Loss- and gain-of-function studies reveal that ILC2- and eosinophil-derived type 2 cytokines stimulate signaling via the IL-4Rα in PDGFRα(+) APs to promote beige fat biogenesis. Together, our results highlight a critical role for ILC2s and type 2 cytokines in the regulation of adipocyte precursor numbers and fate, and as a consequence, adipose tissue homeostasis. PAPERCLIP:"
https://openalex.org/W2033461907,"Dietary restriction (DR) without malnutrition encompasses numerous regimens with overlapping benefits including longevity and stress resistance, but unifying nutritional and molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In a mouse model of DR-mediated stress resistance, we found that sulfur amino acid (SAA) restriction increased expression of the transsulfuration pathway (TSP) enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CGL), resulting in increased hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production and protection from hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury. SAA supplementation, mTORC1 activation, or chemical/genetic CGL inhibition reduced H2S production and blocked DR-mediated stress resistance. In vitro, the mitochondrial protein SQR was required for H2S-mediated protection during nutrient/oxygen deprivation. Finally, TSP-dependent H2S production was observed in yeast, worm, fruit fly, and rodent models of DR-mediated longevity. Together, these data are consistent with evolutionary conservation of TSP-mediated H2S as a mediator of DR benefits with broad implications for clinical translation. PAPERFLICK:"
https://openalex.org/W2005066612,"Intracellular recordings of membrane potential in vitro have defined fundamental properties of synaptic communication. Much less is known about the properties of synaptic connectivity and synaptic transmission in vivo. Here, we combined single-cell optogenetics with whole-cell recordings to investigate glutamatergic synaptic transmission in vivo from single identified excitatory neurons onto two genetically defined subtypes of inhibitory GABAergic neurons in layer 2/3 mouse barrel cortex. We found that parvalbumin-expressing (PV) GABAergic neurons received unitary glutamatergic synaptic input with higher probability than somatostatin-expressing (Sst) GABAergic neurons. Unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials onto PV neurons were also faster and more reliable than inputs onto Sst neurons. Excitatory synapses targeting Sst neurons displayed strong short-term facilitation, while those targeting PV neurons showed little short-term dynamics. Our results largely agree with in vitro measurements. We therefore demonstrate the technical feasibility of assessing functional cell-type-specific synaptic connectivity in vivo, allowing future investigations into context-dependent modulation of synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2072135833,"Babesia microti and Borrelia burgdorferi, the respective causative agents of human babesiosis and Lyme disease, are maintained in their enzootic cycles by the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and use the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) as primary reservoir host. The geographic range of both pathogens has expanded in the United States, but the spread of babesiosis has lagged behind that of Lyme disease. Several studies have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) for B. microti to be below the threshold for persistence (<1), a finding that is inconsistent with the persistence and geographic expansion of this pathogen. We tested the hypothesis that host coinfection with B. burgdorferi increases the likelihood of B. microti transmission and establishment in new areas. We fed I. scapularis larva on P. leucopus mice that had been infected in the laboratory with B. microti and/or B. burgdorferi. We observed that coinfection in mice increases the frequency of B. microti infected ticks. To identify the ecological variables that would increase the probability of B. microti establishment in the field, we integrated our laboratory data with field data on tick burden and feeding activity in an R0 model. Our model predicts that high prevalence of B. burgdorferi infected mice lowers the ecological threshold for B. microti establishment, especially at sites where larval burden on P. leucopus is lower and where larvae feed simultaneously or soon after nymphs infect mice, when most of the transmission enhancement due to coinfection occurs. Our studies suggest that B. burgdorferi contributes to the emergence and expansion of B. microti and provides a model to predict the ecological factors that are sufficient for emergence of B. microti in the wild."
https://openalex.org/W2049581527,"Background In vitro studies have shown inhibitory effects of magnesium (Mg) on phosphate-induced calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells, raising the possibility that maintaining a high Mg level may be useful for reducing cardiovascular risks of patients with hyperphosphatemia. We examined how serum Mg levels affect the association between serum phosphate levels and the risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Methods A nationwide register-based cohort study was conducted using database of the Renal Data Registry of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy in 2009. We identified 142,069 patients receiving in-center hemodialysis whose baseline serum Mg and phosphate levels were available. Study outcomes were one-year cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Serum Mg levels were categorized into three groups (lower, <2.7 mg/dL; intermediate, ≥2.7, <3.1 mg/dL; and higher, ≥3.1 mg/dL). Results During follow-up, 11,401 deaths occurred, out of which 4,751 (41.7%) were ascribed to cardiovascular disease. In multivariable analyses, an increase in serum phosphate levels elevated the risk of cardiovascular mortality in the lower- and intermediate-Mg groups, whereas no significant risk increment was observed in the higher-Mg group. Moreover, among patients with serum phosphate levels of ≥6.0 mg/dL, the cardiovascular mortality risk significantly decreased with increasing serum Mg levels (adjusted odds ratios [95% confidence intervals] of the lower-, intermediate-, and higher-Mg groups were 1.00 (reference), 0.81 [0.66–0.99], and 0.74 [0.56–0.97], respectively.). An interaction between Mg and phosphate on the risk of cardiovascular mortality was statistically significant (P = 0.03). Conclusion Serum Mg levels significantly modified the mortality risk associated with hyperphosphatemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis."
https://openalex.org/W1987666714,"Circadian clocks play a significant role in the correct timing of physiological metabolism, and clock disruption might lead to pathological changes of metabolism. One interesting method to assess the current state of metabolism is metabolomics. Metabolomics tries to capture the entirety of small molecules, i.e. the building blocks of metabolism, in a given matrix, such as blood, saliva or urine. Using mass spectrometric approaches we and others have shown that a significant portion of the human metabolome in saliva and blood exhibits circadian modulation; independent of food intake or sleep/wake rhythms. Recent advances in mass spectrometry techniques have introduced completely non-invasive breathprinting; a method to instantaneously assess small metabolites in human breath. In this proof-of-principle study, we extend these findings about the impact of circadian clocks on metabolomics to exhaled breath. As previously established, our method allows for real-time analysis of a rich matrix during frequent non-invasive sampling. We sampled the breath of three healthy, non-smoking human volunteers in hourly intervals for 24 hours during total sleep deprivation, and found 111 features in the breath of all individuals, 36-49% of which showed significant circadian variation in at least one individual. Our data suggest that real-time mass spectrometric ""breathprinting"" has high potential to become a useful tool to understand circadian metabolism, and develop new biomarkers to easily and in real-time assess circadian clock phase and function in experimental and clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2125499523,"Movement coordination between opposite body sides relies on neuronal circuits capable of controlling muscle contractions according to motor commands. Trunk and limb muscles engage in distinctly lateralized behaviors, yet how regulatory spinal circuitry differs is less clear. Here, we intersect virus technology and mouse genetics to unravel striking distribution differences of interneurons connected to functionally distinct motor neurons. We find that premotor interneurons conveying information to axial motor neurons reside in symmetrically balanced locations while mostly ipsilateral premotor interneurons synapse with limb-innervating motor neurons, especially those innervating more distal muscles. We show that observed distribution differences reflect specific premotor interneuron subpopulations defined by genetic and neurotransmitter identity. Synaptic input across the midline reaches axial motor neurons preferentially through commissural axon arborization, and to a lesser extent, through midline-crossing dendrites capturing contralateral synaptic input. Together, our findings provide insight into principles of circuit organization underlying weighted lateralization of movement."
https://openalex.org/W2064042744,"Citrate synthase (CS), one of the key enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, catalyzes the reaction between oxaloacetic acid and acetyl coenzyme A to generate citrate. Increased CS has been observed in pancreatic cancer. In this study, we found higher CS expression in malignant ovarian tumors and ovarian cancer cell lines compared to benign ovarian tumors and normal human ovarian surface epithelium, respectively. CS knockdown by RNAi could result in the reduction of cell proliferation, and inhibition of invasion and migration of ovarian cancer cells in vitro. The drug resistance was also inhibited possibly through an excision repair cross complementing 1 (ERCC1)-dependent mechanism. Finally, upon CS knockdown we observed significant increase expression of multiple genes, including ISG15, IRF7, CASP7, and DDX58 in SKOV3 and A2780 cells by microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Taken together, these results suggested that CS might represent a potential therapeutic target for ovarian carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2014493509,"Objectives Neuregulin 1 signaling plays an important role in cardiac trabecular development, and in sustaining functional integrity in adult hearts. Treatment with neuregulin 1 enhances adult cardiomyocyte differentiation, survival and/or function in vitro and in vivo. It has also been suggested that recombinant neuregulin 1β1 (NRG1β1) induces cardiomyocyte proliferation in normal and injured adult hearts. Here we further explore the impact of neuregulin 1 signaling on adult cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity. Methods and Results Adult mice were subjected to 9 consecutive daily injections of recombinant NRG1β1 or vehicle, and cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis was quantitated via bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, which was delivered using mini-osmotic pumps over the entire duration of NRG1β1 treatment. NRG1β1 treatment inhibited baseline rates of cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis in normal mice (cardiomyocyte labelling index: 0.019±0.005% vs. 0.003±0.001%, saline vs. NRG1β1, P<0.05). Acute NRG1β1 treatment did result in activation of Erk1/2 and cardiac myosin regulatory light chain (down-stream mediators of neuregulin signalling), as well as activation of DNA synthesis in non-cardiomyocytes, validating the biological activity of the recombinant protein. In other studies, mice were subjected to permanent coronary artery occlusion, and cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis was monitored via tritiated thymidine incorporation which was delivered as a single injection 7 days post-infarction. Daily NRG1β1 treatment had no impact on cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis in the infarcted myocardium (cardiomyocyte labelling index: 0.039±0.011% vs. 0.027±0.021%, saline vs. NRG1β1, P>0.05). Summary These data indicate that NRG1β1 treatment does not increase cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis (and consequently does not increase the rate of cardiomyocyte renewal) in normal or infarcted adult mouse hearts. Thus, any improvement in cardiac structure and function observed following neuregulin treatment of injured hearts likely occurs independently of overt myocardial regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2045897654,"Background Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is one of the curative therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, accelerated progression of residual HCC after incomplete RFA has been reported more frequently. The underlying molecular mechanism of this phenomenon remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used an incomplete RFA orthotopic HCC nude mouse model to study the invasive and metastatic potential of residual cancer as well as the correlated mechanism. Methods The incomplete RFA orthotopic nude mouse models were established using high metastatic potential HCC cell line HCCLM3 and low metastatic potential HCC cell line HepG2, respectively. The changes in cellular morphology, motility, metastasis and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and HCC cell molecular markers after in vitro and in vivo incomplete RFA intervention were observed. Results Pulmonary and intraperitoneal metastasis were observed in an in vivo study. The underlying pro-invasive mechanism of incomplete RFA appeared to be associated with promoting EMT, including down-regulation of E-cadherin and up-regulation of N-cadherin and vimentin. These results were in accordance with the in vitro response of HCC cells to heat intervention. Further studies demonstrated that β-catenin was a pivotal factor during this course and blocking β-catenin reduced metastasis and EMT phenotype changes in heat-treated HCCLM3 cells in vitro. Conclusion Incomplete RFA enhanced the invasive and metastatic potential of residual cancer, accompanying with EMT-like phenotype changes by activating β-catenin signaling in HCCLM3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1991606432,"The existence of vesicular docking sites in central synapses is supported by morphological and biochemical evidence, but their functional role remains elusive. To investigate this role we have studied single depressing GABAergic synapses where multivesicular release and postsynaptic receptor saturation have been documented. We used failure/success patterns to estimate the number of vesicular docking sites, which varied from one to six among synapses. Variations of docking site numbers account for differences in release probability, as well as in the amplitude and decay kinetics of unitary postsynaptic currents. Upon repetitive stimulation, decreasing docking site occupancy likewise accounts for changes both in presynaptic and postsynaptic parameters. Finally steady-state docking site occupancy during train stimulations can be modulated by applying subthreshold presynaptic conditioning potential steps. The results suggest that differences in docking site numbers determine intersynaptic variability and that docking site occupancy is a key parameter controlling single synapse signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2097677448,"Objective To investigate the effectiveness of a worksite social and physical environment intervention on need for recovery (i.e., early symptoms of work-related mental and physical fatigue), physical activity and relaxation. Also, the effectiveness of the separate interventions was investigated. Methods In this 2×2 factorial design study, 412 office employees from a financial service provider participated. Participants were allocated to the combined social and physical intervention, to the social intervention only, to the physical intervention only or to the control group. The primary outcome measure was need for recovery. Secondary outcomes were work-related stress (i.e., exhaustion, detachment and relaxation), small breaks, physical activity (i.e., stair climbing, active commuting, sport activities, light/moderate/vigorous physical activity) and sedentary behavior. Outcomes were measured by questionnaires at baseline, 6 and 12 months follow-up. Multilevel analyses were performed to investigate the effects of the three interventions. Results In all intervention groups, a non-significant reduction was found in need for recovery. In the combined intervention (n = 92), exhaustion and vigorous physical activities decreased significantly, and small breaks at work and active commuting increased significantly compared to the control group. The social intervention (n = 118) showed a significant reduction in exhaustion, sedentary behavior at work and a significant increase in small breaks at work and leisure activities. In the physical intervention (n = 96), stair climbing at work and active commuting significantly increased, and sedentary behavior at work decreased significantly compared to the control group. Conclusion None of the interventions was effective in improving the need for recovery. It is recommended to implement the social and physical intervention among a population with higher baseline values of need for recovery. Furthermore, the intervention itself could be improved by increasing the intensity of the intervention (for example weekly GMI-sessions), providing physical activity opportunities and exercise schemes, and by more drastic environment interventions (restructuring entire department floor).

https://openalex.org/W1964130863,"APOBEC3G (A3G) is a DNA cytidine deaminase (CD) that demonstrates antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and other pathogenic virus.

Although many studies on the structure of A3G-CD2 and enzymatic properties of full-length A3G have been reported, the mechanism of how A3G interacts with HIV-1 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is still not well characterized. Here, we reported a crystal structure of a novel A3G-CD2 head-to-tail dimer (in which the N terminus of the monomer H (head) interacts with the C terminus of monomer T (tail)), where a continuous DNA binding groove was observed. By constructing the A3G-CD1 structural model, we found that its overall fold was almost identical to that of A3G-CD2. We mutated the residues located in or along the groove in monomer H and the residues in A3G-CD1 that correspond to those seated in or along the groove in monomer T. Then, by performing enzymatic assays, we confirmed the reported key elements and the residues in A3G necessary to the catalytic deamination. Moreover, we identified more than 10 residues in A3G essential to DNA binding and deamination reaction. Therefore, this dimer structure may represent a structural model of full-length A3G, which indicates a possible binding mode of A3G to HIV-1 ssDNA.

We used whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) to assess differential gene expression of cultivated normal human melanocytes with respect to keratinocytes, fibroblasts and whole skin. The present results reveal cultivated melanocytes as highly proliferative cells with possible stem cell-like properties. The enhanced readiness to regenerate makes melanocytes the most vulnerable cells in the skin and explains their high risk of developing into malignant melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1979742015,"We report the characterization of a null mutant for zebrafish circadian clock gene period2 (per2) generated by transcription activator-like effector nuclease and a positive role of PER2 in vertebrate circadian regulation. Locomotor experiments showed that per2 mutant zebrafish display reduced activities under light-dark and 2-h phase delay under constant darkness, and quantitative real time PCR analyses showed up-regulation of cry1aa, cry1ba, cry1bb, and aanat2 but down-regulation of per1b, per3, and bmal1b in per2 mutant zebrafish, suggesting that Per2 is essential for the zebrafish circadian clock. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that Per2 represses aanat2 expression through E-box and enhances bmal1b expression through the Ror/Rev-erb response element, implicating that Per2 plays dual roles in the zebrafish circadian clock. Cell transfection and co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Per2 enhances bmal1b expression through binding to orphan nuclear receptor Rorα. The enhancing effect of mouse PER2 on Bmal1 transcription is also mediated by RORα even though it binds to REV-ERBα. Moreover, zebrafish Per2 also appears to have tissue-specific regulatory roles in numerous peripheral organs. These findings help define the essential functions of Per2 in the zebrafish circadian clock and in particular provide strong evidence for a positive role of PER2 in the vertebrate circadian system."
https://openalex.org/W2084514805,"We investigated performance-derived measures of executive control, and their relationship with self- and informant reported executive functions in everyday life, in treatment-naive adults with newly diagnosed Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; n = 36) and in healthy controls (n = 35). Sustained attentional control and response inhibition were examined with the Test of Variables of Attention (T.O.V.A.). Delayed responses, increased reaction time variability, and higher omission error rate to Go signals in ADHD patients relative to controls indicated fluctuating levels of attention in the patients. Furthermore, an increment in NoGo commission errors when Go stimuli increased relative to NoGo stimuli suggests reduced inhibition of task-irrelevant stimuli in conditions demanding frequent responding. The ADHD group reported significantly more cognitive and behavioral executive problems than the control group on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A). There were overall not strong associations between task performance and ratings of everyday executive function. However, for the ADHD group, T.O.V.A. omission errors predicted self-reported difficulties on the Organization of Materials scale, and commission errors predicted informant reported difficulties on the same scale. Although ADHD patients endorsed more symptoms of depression and anxiety on the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) than controls, ASEBA scores were not significantly associated with T.O.V.A. performance scores. Altogether, the results indicate multifaceted alteration of attentional control in adult ADHD, and accompanying subjective difficulties with several aspects of executive function in everyday living. The relationships between the two sets of data were modest, indicating that the measures represent non-redundant features of adult ADHD."
https://openalex.org/W2038732333,"Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional protein that has been linked to various intractable inflammatory diseases. One way by which OPN induces inflammation is the production of various functional fragments by enzyme cleavage. It has been well appreciated that OPN is cleaved by thrombin, and/or matrix metalloproteinase-3 and -7 (MMP-3/7). Although the function of thrombin-cleaved OPN is well characterized, little is known about the function of MMP-3/7-cleaved OPN. In this study, we found a novel motif, LRSKSRSFQVSDEQY, in the C-terminal fragment of MMP-3/7-cleaved mouse OPN binds to α9β1 integrin. Importantly, this novel motif is involved in the development of anti-type II collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA). This study provides the first in vitro and in vivo evidence that OPN cleavage by MMP-3/7 is an important regulatory mechanism for CAIA."
https://openalex.org/W2036387786,"As both a commensal and a major cause of healthcare-associated infections in humans, Enterococcus faecalis is a remarkably adaptable organism. We investigated how E. faecalis adapts in a mammalian host as a pathogen by characterizing changes in the transcriptome during infection in a rabbit model of subdermal abscess formation using transcriptional microarrays. The microarray experiments detected 222 and 291 differentially regulated genes in E. faecalis OG1RF at two and eight hours after subdermal chamber inoculation, respectively. The profile of significantly regulated genes at two hours post-inoculation included genes involved in stress response, metabolism, nutrient acquisition, and cell surface components, suggesting genome-wide adaptation to growth in an altered environment. At eight hours post-inoculation, 88% of the differentially expressed genes were down-regulated and matched a transcriptional profile consistent with a (p)ppGpp-mediated stringent response. Subsequent subdermal abscess infections with E. faecalis mutants lacking the (p)ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase RSH, the small synthetase RelQ, or both enzymes, suggest that intracellular (p)ppGpp levels, but not stringent response activation, influence persistence in the model. The ability of cells to synthesize (p)ppGpp was also found to be important for growth in human serum and whole blood. The data presented in this report provide the first genome-wide insights on E. faecalis in vivo gene expression and regulation measured by transcriptional profiling during infection in a mammalian host and show that (p)ppGpp levels affect viability of E. faecalis in multiple conditions relevant to mammalian infection. The subdermal abscess model can serve as a novel experimental system for studying the E. faecalis stringent response in the context of the mammalian immune system."
https://openalex.org/W1968523670,"Denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidizing (DAMO) microorganisms were enriched from paddy field soils using continuous-flow and batch cultures fed with nitrate or nitrite as a sole electron acceptor. After several months of cultivation, the continuous-flow cultures using nitrite showed remarkable simultaneous methane oxidation and nitrite reduction and DAMO bacteria belonging to phylum NC10 were enriched. A maximum volumetric nitrite consumption rate of 70.4±3.4 mg-N·L−1·day−1 was achieved with very short hydraulic retention time of 2.1 hour. In the culture, about 68% of total microbial cells were bacteria and no archaeal cells were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In the nitrate-fed continuous-flow cultures, 58% of total microbial cells were bacteria while archaeal cells accounted for 7% of total cell numbers. Phylogenetic analysis of pmoA gene sequence showed that enriched DAMO bacteria in the continuous-flow cultivation had over 98% sequence similarity to DAMO bacteria in the inoculum. In contrast, for batch culture, the enriched pmoA gene sequences had 89–91% sequence similarity to DAMO bacteria in the inoculum. These results indicate that electron acceptor and cultivation method strongly affect the microbial community structures of DAMO consortia."
https://openalex.org/W2019375279,"Plant biomass degradation in soil is one of the key steps of carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Fungal saprotrophic communities play an essential role in this process by producing hydrolytic enzymes active on the main components of plant organic matter. Open questions in this field regard the diversity of the species involved, the major biochemical pathways implicated and how these are affected by external factors such as litter quality or climate changes. This can be tackled by environmental genomic approaches involving the systematic sequencing of key enzyme-coding gene families using soil-extracted RNA as material. Such an approach necessitates the design and evaluation of gene family-specific PCR primers producing sequence fragments compatible with high-throughput sequencing approaches. In the present study, we developed and evaluated PCR primers for the specific amplification of fungal CAZy Glycoside Hydrolase gene families GH5 (subfamily 5) and GH11 encoding endo-β-1,4-glucanases and endo-β-1,4-xylanases respectively as well as Basidiomycota class II peroxidases, corresponding to the CAZy Auxiliary Activity family 2 (AA2), active on lignin. These primers were experimentally validated using DNA extracted from a wide range of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota species including 27 with sequenced genomes. Along with the published primers for Glycoside Hydrolase GH7 encoding enzymes active on cellulose, the newly design primers were shown to be compatible with the Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology. Sequences obtained from RNA extracted from beech or spruce forest soils showed a high diversity and were uniformly distributed in gene trees featuring the global diversity of these gene families. This high-throughput sequencing approach using several degenerate primers constitutes a robust method, which allows the simultaneous characterization of the diversity of different fungal transcripts involved in plant organic matter degradation and may lead to the discovery of complex patterns in gene expression of soil fungal communities."

Our aim is to develop and optimise monocyte assays that combine biological relevance, clinical utility, and ease of adoption into routine HIV laboratory practice.Cross-sectional evaluation of concurrent plasma and whole blood samples.A flow cytometry protocol was developed comprising single-tube CD45, CD14, CD16, CD64, CD163, CD143 analysis with appropriately matched isotype controls. Plasma levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14), soluble CD163 (sCD163) and CXCL10 were measured by ELISA.HIV status was associated with significantly increased expression of CD64, CD143 and CD163 on CD16+ monocytes, irrespective of the virological response to HIV therapy. Plasma levels of sCD14, sCD163 and CXCL10 were also significantly elevated in association with viremic HIV infection. Plasma sCD163 and CXCL10 levels were restored to healthy control levels by effective antiretroviral therapy while sCD14 levels remained elevated despite virological suppression (p<0.001).Flow cytometric and plasma biomarkers of monocyte activation indicate an ongoing systemic inflammatory response to HIV infection, characterised by persistent alterations of CD16+ monocyte expression profiles and elevated sCD14 levels, that are not corrected by antiretroviral therapy and likely to be prognostically significant. In contrast, sCD163 and CXCL10 levels declined on antiretroviral therapy, suggesting multiple activation pathways revealed by these biomarkers. Incorporation of these assays into routine clinical care is feasible and warrants further consideration, particularly in light of emerging therapeutic strategies that specifically target innate immune activation in HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W1974322780,"The phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is commonly deregulated in breast cancer through several mechanisms, including PIK3CA mutation and loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase-II (INPP4B). We aimed to evaluate the predictive relevance of these biomarkers to trastuzumab efficacy in HER2-positive disease. We evaluated the effect of trastuzumab in 43 breast cancer patients with HER2-overexpression who received neoadjuvant treatment. PIK3CA mutation was examined by direct sequencing and digital PCR assay, and PIK3CA copy number was assessed by digital PCR assay of pretreatment tissues. PTEN, pAkt, and INPP4B were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Direct sequencing detected mutant DNA in 21% of all patients, but the incidence increased to 49% using digital PCR. The pathological complete response (pCR) rate in patients with PIK3CA mutations was 29% compared with 67% for those without PIK3CA mutations (P = 0.093), when the mutation was defined as positive if the mutant proportion was more than 10% of total genetic content by digital PCR. Low PTEN expression was associated with less pCR compared to high expression (33% versus 72%, P = 0.034). There were no significant associations of PIK3CA copy number, pAKt, or INPP4B with trastuzumab efficacy. In multivariate analysis, activation of the PI3K pathway due to either PIK3CA mutation or low PTEN were related to poorer response to trastuzumab (OR of predictive pCR was 0.11, 95%CI; 0.03-0.48). In conclusion, activating the PI3K pathway is associated with low pCR to trastuzumab-based treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer. Combined analysis of PIK3CA mutation and PTEN expression may serve as critical indicators to identify patients unlikely to respond to trastuzumab."

When voluntary movements of the contralateral limb are not possible due to brain pathology, initial training of such a BMI may require use of the unaffected ipsilateral limb. We conducted an offline investigation of the feasibility of decoding ipsilateral upper limb movements from electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings in three patients with different lesions of sensorimotor systems associated with upper limb control. We found that the first principal component (PC) of unconstrained, naturalistic reaching movements of the upper limb could be decoded from ipsilateral ECoG using a linear model. ECoG signal features yielding the best decoding accuracy were different across subjects. Performance saturated with very few input features. Decoding performances of 0.77, 0.73, and 0.66 (median Pearson's r between the predicted and actual first PC of movement using nine signal features) were achieved in the three subjects. The performance achieved here with small numbers of electrodes and computationally simple decoding algorithms suggests that it may be possible to control a BMI using ECoG recorded from damaged sensorimotor brain systems."
https://openalex.org/W1966562312,"Objectives Obesity is associated with cardiovascular diseases and has become the main public health issue in western countries and urban China. However, the prevalence and secular trends of obesity in rural China are currently unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate secular trends in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among rural adults in northern China between 1991 and 2011. Method The prevalence of overweight and obesity was assessed in adults aged 35–74 years living in a rural area in northern China by comparing two surveys that were conducted in 1991 and 2011, respectively. Result The age-adjusted prevalence of overweight increased from 24.5% in 1991 to 42.0% in 2011, and the prevalence of obesity increased from 5.7% in 1991 to 19.6% in 2011. Over the 21-year period, there were significant increases in the prevalence of overweight and obesity for both men and women in all age groups; however, the greatest increase was observed in men aged 35–44 years, with an 10.3-fold increase in obesity prevalence. The prevalence of obesity increased significantly in all risk factors categories, including education levels, blood pressure categories, diabetes previous history, current smoking situation and alcohol drinking situation over the past 21 years overall (p<0.05). The greatest increase in obesity prevalence appeared among those who consumed alcohol (increased by 8.0-fold). Next, there was a 5.3-fold increase in the prevalence of obesity in illiterate residents. Conclusion The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased rapidly among rural adults in Tianjin over the past 21 years, with the most dramatic increase observed in young men. Therefore, the burden of obesity should serve as a call for action."
https://openalex.org/W2093113575,"Retbindin is a novel retina-specific protein of unknown function. In this study, we have used various approaches to evaluate protein expression, localization, biochemical properties, and function. We find that retbindin is secreted by the rod photoreceptors into the inter-photoreceptor matrix where it is maintained via electrostatic forces. Retbindin is predominantly localized at the interface between photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium microvilli, a region critical for retinal function and homeostasis. Interestingly, although it is associated with photoreceptor outer segments, retbindin's expression is not dependent on their presence. In vitro, retbindin is capable of binding riboflavin, thus implicating the protein as a metabolite carrier between the retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Altogether, our data show that retbindin is a novel photoreceptor-specific protein with a unique localization and function. We hypothesize that retbindin is an excellent candidate for binding retinal flavins and possibly participating in their transport from the extracellular space to the photoreceptors. Further investigations are warranted to determine the exact function of retbindin in retinal homeostasis and disease. Retbindin is a novel retina-specific protein of unknown function.

Further investigations are warranted to determine the exact function of retbindin in retinal homeostasis and disease. Although the retina is composed of multiple cell types, photoreceptors are the light-responsive cells that initiate phototransduction. Phototransduction begins in a modified cilium known as the outer segment (OS), 2The abbreviations used are: OSouter segmentRPEretinal pigment epitheliumIPMinter-photoreceptor matrixWGAwheat germ agglutininPNApeanut agglutininPNGase Fpeptide:N-glycosidase FIFimmunofluorescenceS-IPMsoluble IPMIS-IPMinsoluble IPMDiI1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchloratePECSpigment epithelia/choroid/scleraIRBPinterphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein. which is present on both rod and cone photoreceptors. Because of the complex and energy-intensive nature of light perception, photoreceptors display an elevated energy metabolism unlike any other cell type (1.Alder V.A. Ben-Nun J. Cringle S.J.

A dynamic interface exists between the photoreceptor OSs and the RPE known as the inter-photoreceptor matrix (IPM) (8.Röhlich P. The interphotoreceptor matrix: electron microscopic and histochemical observations on the vertebrate retina.Exp. Eye Res. 1970; 10: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).

Among the many nutrients transported through the IPM, two important metabolites are the riboflavin cofactor derivatives, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin adenine mononucleotide (FMN). FAD and FMN are functionally equivalent as redox co-enzymes and are highly concentrated in the retina relative to blood (∼50 pmol/mg total protein versus ∼2.5 in the retina and blood, respectively) (11.Batey D.W.

Analysis of flavins in ocular tissues of the rabbit.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 1981-1985PubMed Google Scholar). How the retina concentrates such high levels of flavins is currently unknown, but the high level of metabolism in the retina would predict that large concentrations of these nutrients would be required there. FAD is needed for the citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation (13.Tomitsuka E. Hirawake H. Goto Y. Taniwaki M. Harada S. Kita K.

Flavins are usually tightly bound to flavoproteins, and unbound flavins are known to undergo photoreduction to produce free radicals that can cause lipid peroxidation (16.Oster G. Bellin J.S.

Evidence for rod outer segment lipid peroxidation following constant illumination of the rat retina.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1983; 24: 1433-1435PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, flavoproteins are a critical part of maintaining homeostasis in the retina. Given the high concentration of flavins in the retina, it makes sense that the tissue would contain processes for transporting flavins from the RPE to the IPM and then to the photoreceptors, but such systems are not yet described. An expressed sequence tag analysis of an un-amplified human retinal cDNA library identified a novel, highly expressed transcript whose translated peptide shares 27% sequence homology to the riboflavin-binding protein (RBP), a member of the folate receptor superfamily. RBP is specific to chicken oviduct and is known to be involved in the deposition of riboflavin in the chicken egg (20.Wistow G. Bernstein S.L. Wyatt M.K. Ray S. Behal A. Touchman J.W. Bouffard G. Smith D. Peterson K.

Vis. 2002; 8: 196-204PubMed Google Scholar) but with no known mammalian homologs. The newly identified gene, now known as retbindin (Retb), is located on human chromosome 19 (21.Geer L.Y. Marchler-Bauer A. Geer R.C. Han L. He J. He S. Liu C. Shi W. Bryant S.H. The NCBI BioSystems database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D492-D496Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Regulation of flavins in the metabolically active retina is critical, but little is known about retinal flavoproteins. The homology between RBP and Retb suggested that Retb could be a retinal flavoprotein, so here we elected to further investigate the biochemical properties of Retb. We provide evidence that Retb is a mammalian- and neural retina-specific gene with a single transcript and a predicted protein tertiary structure similar to that of RBP. Biochemical analysis revealed that Retb is a secreted peripheral membrane protein and a component of the retinal IPM. In the mouse retina, Retb localized specifically in the photoreceptor cell layer, with predominant localization near the tip of the rod outer segments. Furthermore, heterologously expressed Retb is capable of binding riboflavin, suggesting it may play a key role in the regulation of retinal flavins. Retb and RBP sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (21.Geer L.Y. Marchler-Bauer A. Geer R.C. Han L. He J. He S. Liu C. Shi W. Bryant S.H. The NCBI BioSystems database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D492-D496Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). All known sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega software (22.Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D.

All experiments involving mice were approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and adhered to the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Resolution on the Use of Animals in Research. All mice were negative for the rd8 allele. C57BL/6J mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). P30 wild-type and Rd/Rd mice were euthanized using CO2 asphyxiation, and then the neural retina and PECS were harvested. For light-induced protein translocation, mice were placed in a light box (7,000 lux) for 1 h, and dark-adapted mice were kept in a dark box for 4 h. Enucleated bovine eyes were obtained from Country Home Meat Co. (Edmond, OK). Eyes were dissected, and the neural retina and RPE were harvested separately and frozen in liquid nitrogen. A 56-year-old Caucasian phakic donor eye and a 61-year-old Caucasian normal donor eye were obtained from the Illinois Eye Bank, Chicago, IL. A 4-mm trephine was used to separate the macula from the peripheral neural retina; also the RPE behind the macula was separated from the RPE in the periphery. Another normal 72-year-old Caucasian male eye was dissected, and the neural retina and the RPE were separated. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until used. The anti-Retb antibody was produced by 21st Century Biologicals (Marlboro, MA) against a peptide corresponding to mouse Retb amino acids 115–131. The antiserum was tested at various concentrations against Retb protein recombinantly expressed in vitro (Escherichia coli and COS-7). Full-length Retb cDNA was inserted into a pTriEx-4 vector backbone (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). This construct was transformed into DE3 pLacI-competent cells (EMD Millipore). Cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C. Cultures were sonicated on ice five times for 30 s each. Following the manufacturer's protocols, the protein was isolated using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Thermo, Waltham, MA). Retb was eluted from the beads using 200 mm imidazole. Samples were analyzed via immunoblots as described under “Preparation of Total Retinal/RPE Extracts and Immunoblotting.” COS-7 cells were transfected with the full-length Retb cDNA in a pK vector backbone. ∼1 million cells were transfected with 0.6 μg of DNA via Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen). These cells were analyzed as outlined under “Preparation of Total Retinal/RPE Extracts and Immunoblotting.” A corresponding peptide (amino acids 115–131) was used in a competition assay to demonstrate the Retb specificity of the antibody. In this experiment, anti-Retb antibody was incubated overnight with 50 μg of the peptide used for immunization. This antibody/peptide solution was diluted in either 1× TBST, 1% Tween 20 (details below) or immunofluorescence (IF) blocking solution (details below) and used during the primary antibody incubation step at a Retb antibody final concentration of 1:500. Peptide competition removed all antibody labeling, and no band was observed in mock-transfected cells indicating the specificity of the antibody to retbindin. Eyes were processed, sectioned, and stained as described previously (25.Stricker H.M. Ding X.Q. Quiambao A. Fliesler S.J. Naash M.I. The Cys214→Ser mutation in peripherin/rds causes a loss-of-function phenotype in transgenic mice.Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole eyes were placed in Davidson's fixative (32% ethanol, 11% acetic acid, 2% formaldehyde) overnight, washed in 1× PBS, and then stored in 70% ethanol. Eyes were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 10 μm. Sections were blocked in 2.5% donkey serum, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1% fish gelatin in 1× PBS (pH 7.2) (blocking solution) for 30 min at room temperature. Anti-Retb antibody (1:500, described above) was then applied to the slides for 30 min at room temperature in blocking solution. The following primary antibodies were applied in conjunction with Retb: rhodopsin 1D4 (1:1,000, a generous gift from Dr. Robert Molday); S-opsin (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); retinal degeneration slow (Rds-CT, 1:1,000 (26.Ding X.Q.

Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (1:500, Invitrogen) were applied for 1.5 h at room temperature. Fluorescently tagged wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and peanut agglutinin (PNA) (1:500, Invitrogen) were applied with the secondary antibodies. Slides were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade with DAPI (Invitrogen), and images were captured using a Hamamatsu C-4742 camera on an Olympus BX62 upright spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with UplanSapo objectives (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Images were analyzed using Slidebook version 4 and Adobe Photoshop software licensed to the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Relative quantitative real time-PCR was performed as described previously (27.Han Z. Conley S.M. Makkia R.S. Cooper M.J. Naash M.I. DNA nanoparticle-mediated ABCA4 delivery rescues Stargardt dystrophy in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 3221-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNA was extracted from the various tissues shown in Fig. 2 using TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated by first strand synthesis using an oligo(dT) primer and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time-PCR was performed in triplicate on each sample using a C1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). Three separate amplicons were used for retbindin corresponding to the full-length sequence of exon 1a, exon 1b, and exon 6. The primer pairs are shown in Table 1. Relative expression of Retb amplicons was normalized to hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase as a housekeeping gene and plotted. Three independent quantitative real time-PCR experiments were performed on cDNA samples generated from three separate animals. Melt curve analysis and semi-quantitative RT-PCR were used to verify proper amplicon generation and to ensure the absence of primer dimers. Slope of the amplification curve was used to measure the efficiency of the reaction at 104%, which falls within our predefined limits set at 110 and 90%.TABLE 1Retb primer sequences for quantitative RT-PCRExon 1a Forward 5′-TACACTCGAGCTTGTAGATATAAATGCACCAGTCCC-3′ Reverse 5′-TACATCTAGACACTGCCACTCACCTGTTAGCT-3′Exon 1b Forward 5′-TACACCTCGAGTGAGAACCGAGAGGTGACCG-3′ Reverse 3′-TACATCTAGACCACGGATTAAAACACCGATCC-3′Exon 6 Forward 5′-TACAGCCCACTAGGGCCTTAACTC-3′ Reverse 5′-TACAGTACCGCGGAGATGGAGAT-3′ Open table in a new tab Where not specified elsewhere, tissue extracts for immunoblotting were prepared from mouse, bovine, and human tissues by homogenization with a handheld motor and pestle tip (VWR, Radnor, PA) in a 1× PBS (pH 7.2) solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and incubated on a nutator for 1 h at 4 °C. The insoluble material was pelleted using centrifugation at 4,000 × g, and the supernatants were incubated in reducing Laemmli buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were then separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membranes. Samples under nonreducing conditions had N-ethylmaleimide added to a final concentration of 200 mm. Membranes were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in 5% milk, 1× TBST, 1% Tween 20. Anti-Retb antibody (1:500) in 1× TBST, 1% Tween 20 was added to the membrane and then incubated with shaking for 30 min at room temperature. Blots were then washed three times for 10 min each in 1× TBST, 1% Tween 20. Goat-anti rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:25,000) (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added to the membrane and incubated with shaking for 30 min at room temperature. The blot was washed for 10 min in 1× TBST, 1% Tween 20 three times. The following primary antibodies were used under the same conditions after the membrane was allowed to dry overnight: rhodopsin 1D4 (1:1,000); RPE65 (1:500, Abcam ab-105366); Rds-CT (1:1,000 (26.Ding X.Q.

Blots were probed with β-actin-HRP antibody (1:100,000, Sigma) as a loading control. Intact P30 mouse neural retinas were used to prepare retinal protein lysates as described above. Following the manufacturer's protocols, retinal protein lysates were incubated either with or without PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) under reducing conditions overnight. The following morning, samples were analyzed via immunoblotting as described above. Intact P30 mouse neural retinas were incubated on ice in 1× PBS (pH 7.2) with 1× protease inhibitors for 30 min without agitation. The insoluble IPM and retinal cells were then separated from the soluble interphotoreceptor matrix by centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was considered to contain soluble components of the IPM, although the pellet, which was resuspended in 1× PBS, was considered insoluble IPM and retinal cells. The samples were analyzed via immunoblotting as described above. P30 mouse neural retinas or bovine/human retinas were homogenized with a handheld motor and pestle tip in an isotonic 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 7) containing 1× protease inhibitors. The soluble and membranous portions were separated by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min in a Sorvall Discovery M150 ultracentrifuge (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a fixed angle rotor (Sorvall no. S55S-1009). The pellet (membrane fraction) contains retinal membranes, organelles, cytoskeletal components, and insoluble extracellular matrix. The supernatant represents soluble extracellular matrix and cytosolic components. The pellet was resuspended in the same isotonic Tris buffer and analyzed via immunoblotting as described above. The membrane pellet from the above section was resuspended in a 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 10) containing 100 mm Na2CO3 and 1× protease inhibitors. The pellet was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The Na2CO3-soluble and -insoluble portions were separated by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet (Na2CO3 insoluble) was resuspended in the 100 mm Na2CO3 buffer and analyzed via immunoblotting as described above. Intact P30 mouse neural retinas were incubated at 4 °C in 1× PBS (pH 7.2) containing 1 m NaCl and 1× protease inhibitors for 30 min without agitation. The insoluble IPM and retinal cells were then separated from the NaCl-soluble extracellular matrix by centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer, and the samples were analyzed via immunoblotting as described above. COS-7 cells were grown to 90% confluency in 6-well plates in DMEM made in-house without riboflavin. Cells were transfected with Retb, rbp, Enox2 (ecto-NOX disulfide-thiol exchanger 2), or backbone only vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). All constructs included a pK backbone with a CMV promoter and N-terminal FLAG tag. After 48 h of growth, the media were exchanged with DMEM containing 0.075 mm riboflavin and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the cells were washed four times with 1× PBS, then scraped and collected in 1× PBS. The cells were homogenized with a handheld motor and pestle tip and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min to separate the membranous fraction (contains membranes, organelles, cytoskeletal components, and insoluble extracellular matrix). The pellet was resuspended in 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 10) containing 100 mm Na2CO3 and 1× protease inhibitors to release peripheral membrane proteins (Retb and RBP), and the absorbance was measured at 340 nm. The resuspended pellet was then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged again at 30,000 × g for 15 min to separate the Na2CO3-insoluble fraction from the soluble. The pellet was resuspended in 100 mm Na2CO3 buffer, and the absorbance was measured again and immunoblotted as described above. Relative absorbance was measured as 340 nm absorbance divided by the ratio of FLAG to GAPDH signal. We chose 340 nm wavelength of light as riboflavin absorbs light strongly at 340 nm (16.Oster G. Bellin J.S. Holmstrom B. Photochemistry of riboflavin.Experientia. 1962; 18: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and we chose to use a concentration of 0.075 mm because it is within the linear range of a standard curve for riboflavin concentration (data not shown). The experiment was repeated five independent times, and samples in each iteration were run in triplicate. Two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni pairwise comparative statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Coverslips were placed on the bottom of 6-well plates and cells were grown and transfected as described in “In Vitro Binding Assay.” After the media were removed and cells were washed with PBS, a 4% paraformaldehyde solution was applied to the cells on the coverslips for 15 min at room temperature to fix the cells. After fixation, the experiments were carried out as described above with the primary anti-FLAG antibody (1:1,000) (Cell Signaling) overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody and DiI membrane marker (1:500, Invitrogen) were applied at room temperature for 1.5 h prior to mounting and imaging as described in “Immunofluorescence.” According to NCBI, the mouse Retb coding sequence contains 744 nucleotides (21.Geer L.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2016599510,"Cellular uptake of vitamin A (retinol) is essential for many biological functions. The Stra6 protein binds the serum retinol-binding protein, RBP4, and acts in conjunction with the enzyme lecithin:retinol acyltransferase to facilitate retinol uptake in some cell types. We show that in embryonic stem (ES) cells and in some tissues, the Stra6 gene encodes two distinct mRNAs transcribed from two different promoters. Whereas both are all-trans-retinoic acid (RA)-responsive in ES cells, the downstream promoter contains a half-site RA response element (RARE) and drives an ∼13-fold, RA-associated increase in luciferase reporter activity. We employed CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to show that the endogenous RARE is required for RA-induced transcription of both Stra6 isoforms. We further demonstrate that in ES cells, 1) both RARγ and RXRα are present at the Stra6 RARE; 2) RA increases co-activator p300 (KAT3B) binding and histone H3 Lys-27 acetylation at both promoters; 3) RA decreases Suz12 levels and histone H3 Lys-27 trimethylation epigenetic marks at both promoters; and 4) these epigenetic changes are diminished in the absence of RARγ. In the brains of WT mice, both the longer and the shorter Stra6 transcript (Stra6L and Stra6S, respectively) are highly expressed, whereas these transcripts are found only at low levels in RARγ−/− mice. In the brains of vitamin A-deficient mice, both Stra6L and Stra6S levels are decreased. In contrast, in the vitamin A-deficient kidneys, the Stra6L levels are greatly increased, whereas Stra6S levels are decreased. Our data show that kidneys respond to retinol deficiency by differential Stra6 promoter usage, which may play a role in the retention of retinol when vitamin A is low."

In this study, we aimed to determine the predictive and prognostic roles of oxidative stress-related genetic polymorphisms in metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) patients treated with chemotherapy.In this retrospective study, we genotyped nine oxidative stress-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NQO1, SOD2, SOD3, PON1, GSTP1, GSTT1, and NOS3 (rs1800566, rs10517, rs4880, rs1799895, rs662, rs854560, rs1695, rs2266637, rs1799983, respectively) in 108 consecutive MGC patients treated with epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (EOF) regimen as the first-line chemotherapy and analyzed the association between the genotypes and the disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).We found that, in addition to a lower pathological grade (p = 0.017), NQO1 rs1800566 CT/TT genotype was an independent predictive factor of poor PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-3.16; p = 0.005). PON1 rs662 AA/AG genotype was significantly associated with poor OS (HR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.07-3.54; p = 0.029). No associations were detected between the nine SNPs and DCR.NQO1 rs1800566 is an independent predictive factor of PFS for MGC patients treated with EOF chemotherapy, and PON1 rs662 is a noteworthy prognostic factor of OS. Information on oxidative stress-related genetic variants may facilitate optimization of individualized chemotherapy in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2068914514,"No-take marine reserves (NTMRs) are increasingly being established to conserve or restore biodiversity and to enhance the sustainability of fisheries. Although effectively designed and protected NTMR networks can yield conservation and fishery benefits, reserve effects often fail to manifest in systems where there are high levels of non-compliance by fishers (poaching). Obtaining reliable estimates of NTMR non-compliance can be expensive and logistically challenging, particularly in areas with limited or non-existent resources for conducting surveillance and enforcement. Here we assess the utility of density estimates and re-accumulation rates of derelict (lost and abandoned) fishing line as a proxy for fishing effort and NTMR non-compliance on fringing coral reefs in three island groups of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP), Australia. Densities of derelict fishing line were consistently lower on reefs within old (>20 year) NTMRs than on non-NTMR reefs (significantly in the Palm and Whitsunday Islands), whereas line densities did not differ significantly between reefs in new NTMRs (5 years of protection) and non-NTMR reefs. A manipulative experiment in which derelict fishing lines were removed from a subset of the monitoring sites demonstrated that lines re-accumulated on NTMR reefs at approximately one third (32.4%) of the rate observed on non-NTMR reefs over a thirty-two month period. Although these inshore NTMRs have long been considered some of the best protected within the GBRMP, evidence presented here suggests that the level of non-compliance with NTMR regulations is higher than previously assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2079040964,"The study was aimed at investigating localized topical drug delivery to the breast via mammary papilla (nipple). 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and estradiol (EST) were used as model hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds respectively. Porcine and human nipple were used for in-vitro penetration studies. The removal of keratin plug enhanced the drug transport through the nipple. The drug penetration was significantly higher through the nipple compared to breast skin. The drug's lipophilicity had a significant influence on drug penetration through nipple. The ducts in the nipple served as a major transport pathway to the underlying breast tissue. Results showed that porcine nipple could be a potential model for human nipple. The topical application of 5-FU on the rat nipple resulted in high drug concentration in the breast and minimal drug levels in plasma and other organs. Overall, the findings from this study demonstrate the feasibility of localized drug delivery to the breast through nipple."
https://openalex.org/W2030737959,"Peptides are attracting increasing interest as protease inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate a new inhibitory mechanism and a new type of exosite interactions for a phage-displayed peptide library-derived competitive inhibitor, mupain-1 (CPAYSRYLDC), of the serine protease murine urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). We used X-ray crystal structure analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, liquid state NMR, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and isothermal titration calorimetry and wild type and engineered variants of murine and human uPA. We demonstrate that Arg6 inserts into the S1 specificity pocket, its carbonyl group aligning improperly relative to Ser195 and the oxyanion hole, explaining why the peptide is an inhibitor rather than a substrate. Substitution of the P1 Arg with novel unnatural Arg analogues with aliphatic or aromatic ring structures led to an increased affinity, depending on changes in both P1 - S1 and exosite interactions. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that exosite interactions, while still supporting high affinity binding, differed substantially between different uPA variants. Surprisingly, high affinity binding was facilitated by Ala-substitution of Asp9 of the peptide, in spite of a less favorable binding entropy and loss of a polar interaction. We conclude that increased flexibility of the peptide allows more favorable exosite interactions, which, in combination with the use of novel Arg analogues as P1 residues, can be used to manipulate the affinity and specificity of this peptidic inhibitor, a concept different from conventional attempts at improving inhibitor affinity by reducing the entropic burden."
https://openalex.org/W2058244268,"A highly convenient method has been developed for the synthesis of (prop-2-ynyloxy) benzene and its derivatives. Differently substituted phenol and aniline derivatives were allowed to react with propargyl bromide in the presence of K2CO3 base and acetone as solvent. The compounds were synthesized in good yields (53–85%). Low cost, high yields and easy availability of compounds helped in the synthesis. Electron withdrawing groups favor the formation of stable phenoxide ion thus in turn favors the formation of product while electron donating groups do not favor the reaction. Phenol derivatives gave good yields as compared to that of aniline. As aprotic polar solvents favor SN2 type reactions so acetone provided best solvation for the reactions. K2CO3 was proved to be good for the synthesis. Antibacterial, Antiurease and NO scavenging activity of synthesized compounds were also examined. 4-bromo-2-chloro-1-(prop-2-ynyloxy)benzene 2a was found most active compound against urease enzyme with a percentage inhibition of 82.00±0.09 at 100 µg/mL with IC50 value of 60.2. 2-bromo-4-methyl-1-(prop-2-ynyloxy)benzene 2d was found potent antibacterial against Bacillus subtillus showing excellent inhibitory action with percentage inhibition of 55.67±0.26 at 100 µg/ml wih IC50 value of 79.9.

https://openalex.org/W2014750311,"Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) and its homolog ATF7 are phosphorylated at Thr-69/Thr-71 and at Thr-51/Thr-53, respectively, by stress-activated MAPKs regulating their transcriptional functions in G1 and S phases. However, little is known about the role of ATF2 and ATF7 in G2/M phase. Here, we show that Cdk1-cyclin B1 phosphorylates ATF2 at Thr-69/Thr-71 and ATF7 at Thr-51/Thr-53 from early prophase to anaphase in the absence of any stress stimulation. Knockdown of ATF2 or ATF7 decreases the rate of cell proliferation and the number of cells in M-phase. In particular, the knockdown of ATF7 severely inhibits cell proliferation and G2/M progression. The inducible expression of a mitotically nonphosphorylatable version of ATF7 inhibits G2/M progression despite the presence of endogenous ATF7. We also show that mitotic phosphorylation of ATF7 promotes the activation of Aurora kinases, which are key enzymes for early mitotic events. These results suggest that the Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of ATF7 facilitates G2/M progression, at least in part, by enabling Aurora signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2015586712,"This study aimed to identify the underlying molecular genetic cause in four Spanish families clinically diagnosed of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), comprising one autosomal dominant RP (adRP), two autosomal recessive RP (arRP) and one with two possible modes of inheritance: arRP or X-Linked RP (XLRP). We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) using NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome V3 sample preparation kit and SOLID 5500xl platform. All variants passing filter criteria were validated by Sanger sequencing to confirm familial segregation and the absence in local control population. This strategy allowed the detection of: (i) one novel heterozygous splice-site deletion in RHO, c.937-2_944del, (ii) one rare homozygous mutation in C2orf71, c.1795T>C; p.Cys599Arg, not previously associated with the disease, (iii) two heterozygous null mutations in ABCA4, c.2041C>T; p.R681* and c.6088C>T; p.R2030*, and (iv) one mutation, c.2405-2406delAG; p.Glu802Glyfs*31 in the ORF15 of RPGR. The molecular findings for RHO and C2orf71 confirmed the initial diagnosis of adRP and arRP, respectively, while patients with the two ABCA4 mutations, both previously associated with Stargardt disease, presented symptoms of RP with early macular involvement. Finally, the X-Linked inheritance was confirmed for the family with the RPGR mutation. This latter finding allowed the inclusion of carrier sisters in our preimplantational genetic diagnosis program."
https://openalex.org/W2000718989,"Background and aims Cystic Fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by progressively declining lung function and represents a major factor contributing to the high morbidity and mortality associated with CF. However, apart from spirometry, respiratory disease surrogate markers reliably indicating CF lung disease and the occurrence of pulmonary exacerbations (PEx) are still lacking. Within this study, we aimed to identify new experimental biomarkers for the detection of CF lung disease. Methods 54 adult and 26 pediatric CF patients were included in the study and serum concentrations of MMP-1, -2, -8, -9, -13, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, YKL-40, hyaluronic acid, procollagen III peptide were quantified by ELISA. CF lung disease was diagnosed by lung function test, PEx was defined based on a clinical scoring established by Rosenfeld in 2001. Results Adults and children with moderate to severe CF lung disease exhibited significantly increased serum expression of MMP-8, MMP-9, YKL-40 and TIMP-1. Further, MMP-8, MMP-9 and YKL-40 were significantly increased in adult CF patients suffering from PEx compared to those without clinical signs of respiratory exacerbation. MMP-8, MMP-9, YKL-40, and TIMP-1 serum levels were unaffected by the presence or absence of CF liver disease or pancreatic insufficiency. Conclusions MMP-8, MMP-9, and YKL-40 might serve as novel non-invasive biomarkers of CF lung disease and PEx."
https://openalex.org/W2006758057,"While the heritability of cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence (ND) is well-documented, the contribution of specific genetic variants to specific phenotypes has not been closely examined. The objectives of this study were to test the associations between 321 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that capture common genetic variation in 24 genes, and early smoking and ND phenotypes in novice adolescent smokers, and to assess if genetic predictors differ across these phenotypes.In a prospective study of 1294 adolescents aged 12-13 years recruited from ten Montreal-area secondary schools, 544 participants who had smoked at least once during the 7-8 year follow-up provided DNA. 321 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 24 candidate genes were tested for an association with number of cigarettes smoked in the past 3 months, and with five ND phenotypes (a modified version of the Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire, the ICD-10 and three clusters of ND symptoms representing withdrawal symptoms, use of nicotine for self-medication, and a general ND/craving symptom indicator).The pattern of SNP-gene associations differed across phenotypes. Sixteen SNPs in seven genes (ANKK1, CHRNA7, DDC, DRD2, COMT, OPRM1, SLC6A3 (also known as DAT1)) were associated with at least one phenotype with a p-value <0.01 using linear mixed models. After permutation and FDR adjustment, none of the associations remained statistically significant, although the p-values for the association between rs557748 in OPRM1 and the ND/craving and self-medication phenotypes were both 0.076.Because the genetic predictors differ, specific cigarette smoking and ND phenotypes should be distinguished in genetic studies in adolescents. Fifteen of the 16 top-ranked SNPs identified in this study were from loci involved in dopaminergic pathways (ANKK1/DRD2, DDC, COMT, OPRM1, and SLC6A3).Dopaminergic pathways may be salient during early smoking and the development of ND."
https://openalex.org/W2074032176,"Myocardial ischemia can damage heart muscle and reduce the heart's pumping efficiency. This study used an ischemic swine heart model to investigate the potential for gene electro transfer of a plasmid encoding vascular endothelial growth factor for improving perfusion and, thus, for reducing cardiomyopathy following acute coronary syndrome. Plasmid expression was significantly greater in gene electro transfer treated tissue compared to injection of plasmid encoding vascular endothelial growth factor alone. Higher gene expression was also seen in ischemic versus non-ischemic groups with parameters 20 Volts (p<0.03), 40 Volts (p<0.05), and 90 Volts (p<0.05), but not with 60 Volts (p<0.09) while maintaining a pulse width of 20 milliseconds. The group with gene electro transfer of plasmid encoding vascular endothelial growth factor had increased perfusion in the area at risk compared to control groups. Troponin and creatine kinase increased across all groups, suggesting equivalent ischemia in all groups prior to treatment. Echocardiography was used to assess ejection fraction, cardiac output, stroke volume, left ventricular end diastolic volume, and left ventricular end systolic volume. No statistically significant differences in these parameters were detected during a 2-week time period. However, directional trends of these variables were interesting and offer valuable information about the feasibility of gene electro transfer of vascular endothelial growth factor in the ischemic heart. The results demonstrate that gene electro transfer can be applied safely and can increase perfusion in an ischemic area. Additional study is needed to evaluate potential efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2170360291,"Accumulating data indicate that cancer stem cells contribute to tumor chemoresistance and their persistence alters clinical outcome. Our previous study has shown that ovarian cancer may be initiated by ovarian cancer initiating cells (OCIC) characterized by surface antigen CD44 and c-KIT (CD117). It has been experimentally demonstrated that a microRNA, namely miR-193a, targets c-KIT mRNA for degradation and could play a crucial role in ovarian cancer development. How miR-193a is regulated is poorly understood and the emerging picture is complex. To unravel this complexity, we propose a mathematical model to explore how estrogen-mediated up-regulation of another target of miR-193a, namely E2F6, can attenuate the function of miR-193a in two ways, one through a competition of E2F6 and c-KIT transcripts for miR-193a, and second by binding of E2F6 protein, in association with a polycomb complex, to the promoter of miR-193a to down-regulate its transcription. Our model predicts that this bimodal control increases the expression of c-KIT and that the second mode of epigenetic regulation is required to generate a switching behavior in c-KIT and E2F6 expressions. Additional analysis of the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset demonstrates that ovarian cancer patients with low expression of EZH2, a polycomb-group family protein, show positive correlation between E2F6 and c-KIT. We conjecture that a simultaneous EZH2 inhibition and anti-estrogen therapy can constitute an effective combined therapeutic strategy against ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1992199301,"The role of histamine in the retina is not well understood, despite it regulating a number of functions within the brain, including sleep, feeding, energy balance, and anxiety. In this study we characterized the structure and function of the retina in mice that lacked expression of the rate limiting enzyme in the formation of histamine, histidine decarboxylase (Hdc−/− mouse). Using laser capture microdissection, Hdc mRNA expression was assessed in the inner and outer nuclear layers of adult C57Bl6J wildtype (WT) and Hdc−/−-retinae. In adult WT and Hdc−/−-mice, retinal fundi were imaged, retinal structure was assessed using immunocytochemistry and function was probed by electroretinography. Blood flow velocity was assessed by quantifying temporal changes in the dynamic fluorescein angiography in arterioles and venules. In WT retinae, Hdc gene expression was detected in the outer nuclear layer, but not the inner nuclear layer, while the lack of Hdc expression was confirmed in the Hdc−/− retina. Preliminary examination of the fundus and retinal structure of the widely used Hdc−/−mouse strain revealed discrete lesions across the retina that corresponded to areas of photoreceptor abnormality reminiscent of the rd8 (Crb1) mutation. This was confirmed after genotyping and the strain designated Hdcrd8/rd8. In order to determine the effect of the lack of Hdc-alone on the retina, Hdc−/− mice free of the Crb1 mutation were bred. Retinal fundi appeared normal in these animals and there was no difference in retinal structure, macrogliosis, nor any change in microglial characteristics in Hdc−/− compared to wildtype retinae. In addition, retinal function and retinal blood flow dynamics showed no alterations in the Hdc−/− retina. Overall, these results suggest that histamine plays little role in modulating retinal structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2078065894,"During the course of a differential screen to identify transcripts specific for chick heart/hemangioblast precursor cells, we have identified Ccbe1 (Collagen and calcium-binding EGF-like domain 1). While the importance of Ccbe1 for the development of the lymphatic system is now well demonstrated, its role in cardiac formation remained unknown. Here we show by whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis that cCcbe1 mRNA is initially detected in early cardiac progenitors of the two bilateral cardiogenic fields (HH4), and at later stages on the second heart field (HH9-18). Furthermore, cCcbe1 is expressed in multipotent and highly proliferative cardiac progenitors. We characterized the role of cCcbe1 during early cardiogenesis by performing functional studies. Upon morpholino-induced cCcbe1 knockdown, the chick embryos displayed heart malformations, which include aberrant fusion of the heart fields, leading to incomplete terminal differentiation of the cardiomyocytes. cCcbe1 overexpression also resulted in severe heart defects, including cardia bifida. Altogether, our data demonstrate that although cardiac progenitors cells are specified in cCcbe1 morphants, the migration and proliferation of cardiac precursors cells are impaired, suggesting that cCcbe1 is a key gene during early heart development."
https://openalex.org/W2126000925,"Understanding complex, dynamic, and diverse ecosystems is essential for developing sound management and conservation strategies. Gravel-bed river floodplains are composed of an interlinked mosaic of aquatic and terrestrial habitats hosting a diverse, specialized, and endangered fauna. Therefore, they serve as excellent models to investigate the biodiversity of multiple ecotones and related edge effects. In this study, we investigated the abundance, composition, richness, and conservation status of beetle assemblages at varying sediment depth (0, 0.1, 0.6 and 1.1 m), distance from the channel (1, 5, 20, and 60–100 m, and 5 m within the riparian forest), and time of the year (February–November) across a 200 m-wide gravel bar at the near-natural Tagliamento River (Italy), to detect edge effects in four floodplain ecotones: aquatic-terrestrial, forest-active floodplain, sediment-air, and sediment-groundwater. We used conventional pitfall traps and novel tube traps to sample beetles comparably on the sediment surface and within the unsaturated sediments. We found a total of 308 beetle species (including 87 of conservation concern) that showed multiple, significant positive edge effects across the floodplain ecotones, mainly driven by spatial heterogeneity: Total and red list beetle abundance and richness peaked on the sediment surface, at channel margins, and at the edge of the riparian forest. All ecotones possessed edge/habitat specialists. Most red list species occurred on the sediment surface, including five species previously considered extinct – yet two of these species occurred in higher densities in the unsaturated sediments. Conservation and management efforts along gravel-bed rivers must therefore promote a dynamic flow and sediment regime to create and maintain habitat heterogeneity and ecotone diversity, which support a unique and high biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W1968716078,"The aim of this study was to clarify the nature of visual processing deficits caused by cerebellar disorders. We studied the performance of two types of visual search (top-down visual scanning and bottom-up visual scanning) in 18 patients with pure cerebellar types of spinocerebellar degeneration (SCA6: 11; SCA31: 7). The gaze fixation position was recorded with an eye-tracking device while the subjects performed two visual search tasks in which they looked for a target Landolt figure among distractors. In the serial search task, the target was similar to the distractors and the subject had to search for the target by processing each item with top-down visual scanning. In the pop-out search task, the target and distractor were clearly discernible and the visual salience of the target allowed the subjects to detect it by bottom-up visual scanning. The saliency maps clearly showed that the serial search task required top-down visual attention and the pop-out search task required bottom-up visual attention. In the serial search task, the search time to detect the target was significantly longer in SCA patients than in normal subjects, whereas the search time in the pop-out search task was comparable between the two groups. These findings suggested that SCA patients cannot efficiently scan a target using a top-down attentional process, whereas scanning with a bottom-up attentional process is not affected. In the serial search task, the amplitude of saccades was significantly smaller in SCA patients than in normal subjects. The variability of saccade amplitude (saccadic dysmetria), number of re-fixations, and unstable fixation (nystagmus) were larger in SCA patients than in normal subjects, accounting for a substantial proportion of scattered fixations around the items. Saccadic dysmetria, re-fixation, and nystagmus may play important roles in the impaired top-down visual scanning in SCA, hampering precise visual processing of individual items."

However, various neurological defects may also be detected. The aim of this study was to evaluate aspects of brain structure and function using PET-CT (positron emission tomography and computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in pediatric patients with WFS. Regional changes in brain glucose metabolism were measured using standardized uptake values (SUVs) based on images of (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in 7 WFS patients aged 10.1–16.0 years (mean 12.9±2.4) and in 20 healthy children aged 3–17.9 years (mean 12.8±4.1). In all patients the diagnosis of WFS was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the WFS1 gene. Hierarchical clustering showed remarkable similarities of glucose uptake patterns among WFS patients and their differences from the control group. SUV data were subsequently standardized for age groups <13 years old and>13 years old to account for developmental differences. Reduced SUVs in WFS patients as compared to the control group for the bilateral brain regions such as occipital lobe (−1.24±1.20 vs. −0.13±1.05; p = 0.028) and cerebellum (−1.11±0.69 vs. −0.204±1.00; p = 0.036) were observed and the same tendency for cingulate (−1.13±1.05 vs. −0.15±1.12; p = 0.056), temporal lobe (−1.10±0.98 vs. −0.15±1.10; p = 0.057), parietal lobe (−1.06±1.20 vs. −0.08±1.08; p = 0.058), central region (−1.01±1.04 vs. −0.09±1.06; p = 0.060), basal ganglia (−1.05±0.74 vs. −0.20±1.07; p = 0.066) and mesial temporal lobe (−1.06±0.82 vs. −0.26±1.08; p = 0.087) was also noticed. After adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing, the differences in glucose uptake were non-significant. For the first time, regional differences in brain glucose metabolism among patients with WFS were shown using PET-CT imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2048330366,"Recent studies have suggested that synphilin-1, a cytoplasmic protein, is involved in energy homeostasis. Overexpression of synphilin-1 in neurons results in hyperphagia and obesity in animal models. However, the mechanism by which synphilin-1 alters energy homeostasis is unknown. Here, we used cell models and biochemical approaches to investigate the cellular functions of synphilin-1 that may affect energy balance. Synphilin-1 was pulled down by ATP-agarose beads, and the addition of ATP and ADP reduced this binding, indicating that synphilin-1 bound ADP and ATP. Synphilin-1 also bound GMP, GDP, and GTP but with a lower affinity than it bound ATP. In contrast, synphilin-1 did not bind with CTP. Overexpression of synphilin-1 in HEK293T cells significantly increased cellular ATP levels. Genetic alteration to abolish predicted ATP binding motifs of synphilin-1 or knockdown of synphilin-1 by siRNA reduced cellular ATP levels. Together, these data demonstrate that synphilin-1 binds and regulates the cellular energy molecule, ATP. These findings provide a molecular basis for understanding the actions of synphilin-1 in energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2010876182,"Chemotactic migration of fibroblasts toward growth factors relies on their capacity to sense minute extracellular gradients and respond to spatially confined receptor-mediated signals. Currently, mechanisms underlying the gradient sensing of fibroblasts remain poorly understood. Using single-particle tracking methodology, we determined that a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) gradient induces a spatiotemporally restricted decrease in the mobility of LPA receptor 2 (LPA2) on chemotactic fibroblasts. The onset of decreased LPA2 mobility correlates to the spatial recruitment and coupling to LPA2-interacting proteins that anchor the complex to the cytoskeleton. These localized PDZ motif-mediated macromolecular complexes of LPA2 trigger a Ca(2+) puff gradient that governs gradient sensing and directional migration in response to LPA. Disruption of the PDZ motif-mediated assembly of the macromolecular complex of LPA2 disorganizes the gradient of Ca(2+) puffs, disrupts gradient sensing, and reduces the directional migration of fibroblasts toward LPA. Our findings illustrate that the asymmetric macromolecular complex formation of chemoattractant receptors mediates gradient sensing and provides a new mechanistic basis for models to describe gradient sensing of fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2016268223,"Pancreatic lipase plays a key role in intestinal digestion of feed fat, and is often deficient in young animals such as weaning piglets. The objective of this study was to express and characterize a partial codon optimized porcine pancreatic lipase (opPPL). A 537 bp cDNA fragment encoding N-terminus amino acid residue of the mature porcine pancreatic lipase was synthesized according to the codon bias of Pichia pastoris and ligated to the full-length porcine pancreatic lipase cDNA fragment. The codon optimized PPL was cloned into the pPICZαA (Invitrogen, Beijing, China) vector. After the resultant opPPL/pPICZαΑ plasmid was transformed into P. pastoris, the over-expressed extracellular opPPL containing a His-tag to the C terminus was purified using Ni Sepharose affinity column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA), and was characterized against the native enzyme (commercial PPL from porcine pancreas, Sigma). The opPPL exhibited a molecular mass of approximately 52 kDa, and showed optimal temperature (40°C), optimal pH (8.0), Km (0.041 mM), and Vmax (2.008 µmol x mg protein(-1) x min(-1)) similar to those of the commercial enzyme with p-NPP as the substrate. The recombinant enzyme was stable at 60°C, but lost 80% (P<0.05) of its activity after exposure to heat ≥60°C for 20 min. The codon optimization increased opPPL yield for ca 4 folds (146 mg x L(-1) vs 36 mg x L(-1)) and total enzyme activity increased about 5 folds (1900 IU x L(-1) vs 367 IU x L(-1)) compared with those native naPPL/pPICZαΑ tranformant. Comparison of gene copies and mRNA profiles between the two strains indicated the increased rePPL yields may partly be ascribed to the increased protein translational efficiency after codon optimization. In conclusion, we successfully optimized 5-terminal of porcine pancreatic lipase encoding gene and over-expressed the gene in P. pastoris as an extracellular, functional enzyme. The recombination enzyme demonstrates a potential for future use as an animal feed additive for animal improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2048424229,"Neisseria meningitidis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has adjuvant properties that can be exploited to assist vaccine immunogenicity. The modified penta-acylated LPS retains the adjuvant properties of hexa-acylated LPS but has a reduced toxicity profile. In this study we investigated whether two modified glycoform structures (LgtE and IcsB) of detoxified penta-acylated LPS exhibited differential adjuvant properties when formulated as native outer membrane vesicles (nOMVs) as compared to the previously described LgtB variant. Detoxified penta-acylated LPS was obtained by disruption of the lpxL1 gene (LpxL1 LPS), and three different glycoforms were obtained by disruption of the lgtB, lgtE or icsB genes respectively. Mice (mus musculus) were immunized with a recombinant PorA P1.7-2,4 (rPorA) protein co-administered with different nOMVs (containing a different PorA serosubtype P1.7,16), each of which expressed one of the three penta-acylated LPS glycoforms. All nOMVs induced IgG responses against the rPorA, but the nOMVs containing the penta-acylated LgtB-LpxL1 LPS glycoform induced significantly greater bactericidal activity compared to the other nOMVs or when the adjuvant was Alhydrogel. Compared to LgtE or IcsB LPS glycoforms, these data support the use of nOMVs containing detoxified, modified LgtB-LpxL1 LPS as a potential adjuvant for future meningococcal protein vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2088989103,"Besides the active Wnt signalling itself, the extracellular inhibition by Dkk1 is important for various embryonic developmental processes, such as optic vesicle differentiation and facial outgrowth. Although a feedback crosstalk of the active Wnt/β-catenin signaling and Dkk1 regulation has been suggested, the control of Dkk1 transcription by the Tcf/Lef1 mediated Wnt signalling and its connection to additional signalling factors has not been elucidated in vivo. Here, we used a combination of transgenic mouse approaches and biochemical analyses to unravel the direct Dkk1 transcriptional regulation via Tcf/Lefs. By using site directed mutagenesis, we tested several conserved Tcf/Lef1 binding sites within Dkk1 conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) and found that these are required for tissue specific reporter expression. In addition a conserved Msx1/2 binding site is required for retinal reporter expression and Msx2 but not Msx1 binds its conserved binding site within CNE195 in the optic cups. Within craniofacial expression domains, Lef1 interferes with Dkk1 directly via two conserved Tcf/Lef1 binding sites in the craniofacial enhancer CNE114, both of which are required for the general craniofacial Dkk1 reporter activation. Furthermore, these Tcf/Lef1 sites are commonly bound in the whisker hair bud mesenchyme but specifically Tcf/Lef1 (no. 2) is required for mandibular activation and repression of maxillar Dkk1 activation. Lastly, we tested the Tcf/Lef1 binding capacities of the Dkk1 promoter and found that although Lef1 binds the Dkk1 promoter, these sites are not sufficient for tissue specific Dkk1 activation. Together, we here present the importance of conserved Tcf/Lef1 and Msx1/2 sites that are required for differential Dkk1 transcriptional reporter activation in vivo. This requirement directly correlates with Lef1 and Msx1/2 interaction with these genomic loci."
https://openalex.org/W2061170470,"This event-related potential (ERP) study explored individual differences associated with gender and level of self-insight in early semantic processing. Forty-eight Chinese native speakers completed a semantic judgment task with three different categories of words: abstract neutral words (e.g., logic, effect), concrete neutral words (e.g., teapot, table), and emotion words (e.g., despair, guilt). They then assessed their levels of self-insight. Results showed that women engaged in greater processing than did men. Gender differences also manifested in the relationship between level of self-insight and word processing. For women, level of self-insight was associated with level of semantic activation for emotion words and abstract neutral words, but not for concrete neutral words. For men, level of self-insight was related to processing speed, particularly in response to abstract and concrete neutral words. These findings provide electrophysiological evidence for the effects of gender and self-insight on semantic processing and highlight the need to take into consideration subject variables in related research."
https://openalex.org/W2102144117,"Inductors, transmission lines, and Tesla transformers have been modeled with lumped-element equivalent circuits for over a century. In a well-known paper from 1904, Paul Drude predicts that the mutual inductance for an unloaded Tesla transformer should be nonreciprocal. This historical curiosity is mostly forgotten today, perhaps because it appears incorrect. However, Drude's prediction is shown to be correct for the conditions treated, demonstrating the importance of constraints in deriving equivalent circuits for distributed systems. The predicted nonreciprocity is not fundamental, but instead is an artifact of the misrepresentation of energy by an equivalent circuit. The application to modern equivalent circuits is discussed."
